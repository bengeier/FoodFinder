Tip: make reservations; we waited over an hour to get a table on a Sat night. 

The food was typical nice Italian food. Nothing special or memorable but I would say it's a great restaurant for a first date. It's impressive without being too costly and has a comfortable atmosphere without being too loud."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat  when craving Italian.  Good fresh seafood and excellent well prepared pasta.  Nice place for a date or to go with significant other."}
{"text":"I would give 3 stars for food and 4 stars for the atmosphere. We had the linguine calamarti and risotto mare. Linguine was a bit bland but the risotto was good. Not a bad place to drop by if you are in the area (but no parking). Great date spot."}
{"text":"4.5*

I pass by La Vecchia at least couple of times a week... and I've always been tempted to go in and try their food but it never happened... until last night. And they didn't fail to impress.

Highlights:

I love the ambiance. The first thing you notice as you walk in is that the place is romantic, trendy, dark, mysterious, and upbeat all at the same time. 

The staff were very attentive and we were seated right away. Our waiter was very helpful and knew the menu inside out and had great recommendations. Our waiter was also very friendly and checked up on us regularly and we never had to wait for more than 10 min for any of the dishes. 

We had the ravioli de niro: meat ravioli with wild mushrooms with a butter sauce. This dish was fantastic! Really delicious. If you like pasta, butter and mushrooms, you're going to LOOOVE this dish.

We also tried the rigatoni romani. Pasta dish with smoked chicken, Portobello mushrooms and a whole lot of goat cheese! Again... really good!

Reasonable prices. Our bill was less than $50. Two main dishes + appetizer. 

I'm starting to like this place more than Grazie a block south of this one. 

Tips: 
-Perfect for a date.
-Make a reservation in advance if you want to go here on the weekends or if you have a large group.
- don't order Pizza at this place... stick with pasta... that's what they're famous for... same with Grazie."}
{"text":"Friendly local italian restaurant.  The food was good but the service was slow.  I will try again but I will make sure I have plenty of time"}
{"text":"Really really nice decor & atmosphere. Service was excellent & food was delicious! The panda cotta is a must try"}
{"text":"We tried beef ravioli and risotto, both were nicely cooked and full of flavor. But the service was the worst I've ever experienced! First the owner(the guy who led us to our table) told us that they were full,even we had reservation on Opentable, we waited 30mins and he just gave us a what-else-I-can-do kinda look. Then when we were ready to pay,we wanted to use a cheque from Opentable,and the owner said he had never seen it before so he was not willing to take it..I guess apologizing is just not his thing..."}
{"text":"Always a delight, great service ! The food is delicious, tasty, just full blown yummy !! My favourite restaurant at Yonge and Eglington"}
{"text":"Located North East on Yonge and Eglinton (2nd block), this place is quite good.  

Quality of food was fresh, service was attentive and warm.  Ambiance is nice.  Prices very competitive (most dishes in the mid-teens).  Highly recommend for a upper casual outing.  

Guys, the GFs will be pleasantly surprised at this place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fantastic - a really nice quirky blend or old and new, and we were able to site outside which was nice. 

The service was good, although it did take a while for our food to arrive, especially given it was lunch time and not very busy. 

The food itself was to be expected. I had a Focaccia Salsiccia with sausages, mushrooms, peppers and onion, it was a bit dry for my taste (no sauce of any kind on the focaccia), and the focaccia itself was rather dry and heavy - not the traditional light mouth water fresh focaccia I was expecting. My fiance had a seafood risotto which he enjoyed, the shrimps in it were excellent.

As others have mentioned they tried to up sell us on the water (flat or sparkling) and when I asked for a pitcher of tap water they said they didn't have pitchers, given it was the middle of the day and 35 degrees out I would have really liked a pitcher of ice water. Although the did do a good job of keeping our glasses filled as we drained them like fish.

All in all it was a pretty average meal - nothing inherently wrong but I wasn't leaving singing it's praises."}
{"text":"A good example of nice Italian food - not amazing but it's about 400m from my apartment so I am very happy with it. 
I had Caprese salad followed by Ravioli De Niro which was a good dinner. Also washed it down with some Primitivo. I dined alone and was happy to have good chats with the waiter and maitre D, didn't feel rushed though it was busy for a Tuesday and left feeling full and satisfied. Didn't have room for dessert! 
Good food - decent service and nice wine - can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"The food an service here are amazing. The four of us had: veal scallopini x 2, gnocchi with 4 cheeses, mushroom risotto, caprese salad, ferrar rocher gelato, and honey ricotta cheesecake, with coffee and wine. $50/person with tax and tip.

All dishes were excellent. The desserts were absolutely out of this world!!
We were lucky that we went on a Monday night, as we had not made reservations. This is a popular place - well-deserved!!"}
{"text":"Always consistent.  Very good food.  Same chef for years which is a big plus for them because she's amazing.  Great for dates, families, special events etc.  I don't normally go for Italian food cause it does nothing for me but if I was, this is a handful of places I'd dine at"}
{"text":"Nice ambiente. A little noisy (Typically Italian). Good food but not extraordinary. The prices for entrees are a little high for the stuff you get. But its worth a try..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a wide selection of appetizers, pastas, salads, etc. Their desserts are superb and the service is surprisingly fast for food that is cooked hours at a time. The waiter who served me was very kind, attentive, and knowledgable about the menu."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here - particularly their Capricciosa - and often drop in after a movie at Yonge and Eg..  The staff are always friendly and welcoming, and seem to remember everyone who comes through.  Best to make reservations - they are always busy later in the evening."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian restaurants. Make sure you get the Seth Rogen-looka-like as your server. He's awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I'd definately come back to try more pasta. Highly recommend Linguini Frutti Di Mare and Tiramisu."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were asked whether we wanted flat or bubbly water. My friends opted for bubbly, while I asked for flat. Our waiter then promptly tried to open a bottle of flat water, which I would've been charged for, which reminded me of tourist traps in foreign countries where they try to charge you for everything under the sun. We then informed him that our friend was running late, so we would be ordering wine and appetizers first and waiting for her to arrive to order our mains. Upon hearing this, he advised that he had to check if this was okay with management, since they have a 1.5 to 2 hour seating limit (and they do, but only on weekends and *not* on Thursday evenings, which is when we went). Overall, not the friendliest welcome. 

Our waiter did get friendlier as the night progressed, but it turned into a creepy vibe, as he constantly hovered over our table and made jokes about listening in on our conversation.

The food was decent. I shared the vodka penne and four cheese pizza with my friend. The atmosphere was okay. I guess I'm giving this place two stars only because of the erratic service, which started cool and ended as what I can only describe as intrusively friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place!

Really friendly and helpful staff, food was delicious and the ambiance was romantic and classic."}
{"text":"Beautiful, and absolutely freaking gorgeous place. Just saw the picture of gelato a la vecchia. I know I ate pasta with shrimp here, now I feel like going back for deserts that I never got to try. Appetizer as well. Feels so authentic, by far one of the nicest looking restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Felt like stepping back into time. Looking forward to trying risotto porcini and rigatoni romani. From so little italian restaurants I have tried in Toronto, this one by far takes the cake, and although I haven't been to too many, from the looks and sounds of it on here, it seems justified."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night! La Vecchia has a small romantic atmosphere, wine a great wine list to add. The server provided my boyfriend and I with great service, he knew all the specials and even described them. My boyfriend got the soup of the day which was a zucchini and potato soup, quite good. We both got a pasta dish with seafood and it was amazing. Our favourite part was the desert, the cheese cake of the day, with a chocolate brownie and caramel; it was amazing!! Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Friday night, my friends and I went to La Vecchia for dinner to celebrate 2 of our girlfriend's birthdays. We went under reservations, and were seated in the beautiful brick cellar downstairs. I went in with very to little expectations as it was my first time there. However, seeing how busy the place was along with it's romantic ambiance, I knew I would probably be in for a big surprise (I cant' forget to mention the amazing aromatics we were greeted with at the door either). 

Our server was a gentlemen by the name Gregory. Gregory's service was exemplary and one that will be remembered by our group for a very long time. He made every single one of us feel like we were being taken care of. We felt like rock stars. My friend and I ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc which was no longer available, he seemed like he knew what he was talking about so he suggested another bottle. Lo behold it was delicious just as he had promised. He was so friendly, so accommodating, and most importantly extremely attentive to our big group. Quite easily the best service I've ever received anywhere. He has definitely set the bar high for any future restaurants we will be eating at! 

The food was so so delicious. I had the Rigatoni Romani. It was hearty, smokey, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. Simply put, the dish felt like warm hug from your friend's Nonna. 

It is quite obvious that I had such a positive experience here. From the amazing service and  delicious food, to the romantic aesthetic of the restaurant itself, it is definitely a midtown gem.  I would recommend making reservations for a bigger group (actually for any size, the place was super busy). So if you're looking for a great place for a first, second, third of 100th date La Vecchia is definitely a place that will impress any date."}
{"text":"Tuesday night. Rammmed packed! and made no reservations for 7:30.  Only waited maybe 10 minutes.

I ordered the goat cheese rigatoni. It was from heaven... really rich and creamy sauce that you want to just dip with bread at the end.

My friend ordered their fish special of the day. It was cold, and tasteless. We had to get them to make another one which tasted delicious but by the time we waited for it, the appetite and mood changed the expectations.

Candle lit. Very romantic place. I'd suggest it for dates. They have a decent list of wine, especially from Italy."}
{"text":"The food was not authentic Italian. Feta in salad at an Italian resto?? The chicken pollo I got was way too salty and overpriced (it was a small portion, too). Poor service didn't contribute to a positive experience either. The waiter even had the nerves to tell us too isn't included in our bill."}
{"text":"A while ago I was there and I ordered the gnocchi quattro formaggi ($18.75) -  Totally unpalatable, 100% glue The waitress took my plate away, never asking what was wrong, and not offering any help when I told her the gnocchi were horrendous. Good-bye La Vecchia."}
{"text":"Please do no waste your money here!  I came with a friend on a Friday night. Since it was my first time there I wanted to go over the menu and decide what I wanted; however my friend soley came there for the fish. When the waiter came around to take our order she told him to take her order because I was still deciding. He took so long to come back (20 mins later!!) that when he took my order the fish had sold out! My friend was livid. The waiter did not even offer an apology and then turned around and blamed me! He said because he had to come back since I wanted more time to decide that it was my fault the fish sold out. I wanted to get up and leave. Never had I been to a restaurant and been insulted like that. We ended up staying which we both regret. The food was ok i've definately had WAY better Italian food and especially with the prices on the menu I expected much tastier food. Plus the waiter did not check on us once and we had to ask another waiter just to give us bread that we noticed that everyone else had. Don't waste your time coming to this joke of a restaurant, support other local businesses elsewhere."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in midtown Toronto. Top-notch food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant with such a beautiful European flair like La Vecchia. This restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been too. I enjoyed the fact that this place had great Italian food and a true Italian ambiance. They have beautiful stone walls, deep red curtains, slightly dimmed lights, dark furniture and the walls are covered in Italian pictures and art. This place is cozy and fancy without the snobbiness, which I love. 

La Vecchia has a brunch, lunch, dinner, group lunch and group dinner menus. I came here for lunch and had the rigatoni romani and loved it! The pasta was cooked perfectly, the smoked chicken was so tender and yum and the blush sauce with goat cheese was so good I wanted to stick my face in it! My hubs had pizza which I tried, and that was very good too. The portions are generous and satisfying; I walked in hungry and couldn't even finish my pasta.

The staff is extremely kind and the service is excellent; the food is reasonably priced for what it is, but it is a tab bit pricey during dinner time. The only downfall about this place is that the drinks and desserts are really overpriced.

Overall, La Vecchia is a great Italian restaurant, but their drinks and desserts are pricey."}
{"text":"Bad service! The server was very rude and abrasive. We had a cup of Starbucks tea with us when we went into the restaurant. I would understand if it was explained politely to us that external drinks are not allowed inside. However, the server poured the tea out without asking or letting us know. 
Near the end of the meal, the server asked if I would like to top up my coffee, but he never came back to refill it even though I had said yes. 
Over at the next table, I overheard the server and the customer debating over what was asked to go with the coffee - cream or milk. And of course, the server blamed the customer for making the mistake. 
Overall, the food was ok, but the restaurant lost points for poor customer service. I recommend that their servers go through customer training if they want to stay in business. We are definitely not going back again. There are other really good Italian restaurants in the area - Grazie is one."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant last night.  The food here is amazing - seriously sooooo good!  I had Antipasto Di Casa as an appetizer (amazing seafood with marinated veggies and goat cheese wrapped with smoked salmon), as a main I had the Grigliata Di Pesce (grilled shrimps, calamari, salmon, branzino, served with a tomato and purple onion salad), and for dessert a caramel crunch cake.  My husband had the Il Tagliere to start (soppresata, capicola, proscuiutto,etc) and as a main had the Diavola pizza.  Prices were good for the food served.  It's very busy so reservations are a must.  Great experience here last night!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is Amazing for a date with your girlfriend on a Friday night dinner. I can still remember the taste of the grilled calamari we had for the appetizer, they were perfectly cooked and tasted like they we supposed to. The risotto with beef in mushroom sauce was great but nothing compared to the linguini with seafood which was outstanding. I could note the freshness of the seafood. Service was good however they kick you out when you are done in a kind of polite way but it is still rude. Of course after everything is paid. 
 I will definitely go again because of the food but next time I'll tip the waiter in cash after he brings me the coat. 

BTW the prices are higher than showed online. Bill was high as well but enjoyable if you can afford it"}
{"text":"After a bad experience for a brunch the day before (see my previous review) we went to young and Eglinton in search of a nice restaurant. We ended up at le vecchia. 
Absolutely amazing and romantic place, we were a bit hesitant cause the prices looked pretty good for the class of restaurant. Anyway a great server, Sony, greeted us and explained the food... Very professional. 
Not a long list of brunch menu but we could mix and match. We ordered Benedict with a side if sausage. Amazing. We got curious and ordered some risotto just to try for the next time. That was even better.
Just a note, coffee was extra. The total price for the Benedict and coffee came to 16 which totally worth it. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Definitely our favourite Italian restaurant in town! The food and atmosphere is just incredible !"}
{"text":"Personally, I've been going to this place for years and have never had a bad experience. Good atmosphere, good service, great food. They're willing to substitute which is great and I usually get some kind of chicken and peppers dish. (One of the best chicken dishes I've ever eaten) A lot of times they've messed up the orders of the people I'm with, but for me I've always had great experiences. I'd recommend at least trying the place as it is a great italian food find."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend and loved it.  We went early as it gets very busy for dinner and were seated right away. The ambience is very cozy.  I ordered the Rigatoni Romani and calamari as appetizer which I enjoyed.
The best part about the place is the service.  Our waiter was personable, funny and did not hover.  We sat there for a while chatting and never felt rushed to leave.  He gave us suggestions and opinions on the menu and explained the meal preparation well.  The manager/owner of the restaurant came over a few times to say hi, introduce himself and share in some jokes.
I highly recommend the place.  Just make sure to go early or make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went on a date here with the wifey. Honestly bang up spot they seated us at a day table for two. When I asked if they can put another table beside us so we have more room, he went to the back and shortly after, they put the tables together. Food amazing ordered fillet and it came out top notch medium rare. The chef is amazing, you should try it!!"}
{"text":"This is where I go when there is something special. Have taken over 30 people and without exception everyone of them has enjoyed the food, hospitality and mood.

Cannot go wrong :)"}
{"text":"This place was packed on Saturday night, but despite that and the fact that we had a group of 9 people, our service was spectacular. Our waiter was spectacular. He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and even went so far as to help us out with our wine selection. I realize that he may have up sold us a bit on the wine, but I don't really care because what he recommended was great. 

The food at La Vecchia, if you hadn't guess already, is very traditional Italian and they are proud of it. The menu cover most of Italy. I tried the Antipasto Di Casa to start. The antipasto came with a seafood salad, roasted veggies, and flat breads, tomato and boccaccini. This was a perfect appetizer for 2 or 3 people. It is nice and light, the flavors are well balanced, and there is a little bit of everything. For my main I had the grilled red snapper. This came in a beautiful lemon sauce and a side of salad. The simplicity of this dish is what made it special. It was exactly what it should have been, light and delicious. We didn't actually try any of the desserts, which is a bit unfortunately because my wife and I love sampling tiramisu... Next time I guess. 

The next time I have a craving for some great Italian food this is the first place that I am heading. Although it isn't as well known as some of the more popular Italian places further downtown, I think it is a lot better (cough.. cough.. I am looking at you Blu)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the city! The food is amazing, the service is friendly and helpful, and the ambiance is fantastic! I've gone probably about once a month for the past 2 years, mainly for dinner. 

The atmosphere is really conducive to a romantic dinner or friendly conversation. They have great wines and the servers know their wines so well, and are able to make great recommendations.

The food is amazing! I've had everything from salads, to pastas, to pizzas, to entrees and they have all been top notch! Their mixed drinks are wonderful. The dessert portions are big enough for 2 to share.

Highly recommend this place if you like Italian! It is worth the money."}
{"text":"Went here for mine and my bf's anniversary. Wanted to try something new out of our comfort zone. 
Ambiance was great! Place was super romantic, dim lights and super cozy. Perfect date spot! 
As an appetizer we shared CARPACCIO LA VECCHIA which is thinly sliced marinated beef tenderloin / definitely a 5/5
My bf had RAVIOLI DE NIRO / 2.5
I had PENNE ALLA VODKA / 3
My bf's ravioli was a little hard same with me penne overall nothing special about both dishes and mine was too salty for my liking.
Became too overwhelming for me to actually enjoy or wanted to finish it.
Service was friendly. As they should be in fine dining.
I would return if I really wanted to give this place another chance by trying another dish in hopes of the penne not being hard but in all honesty I had better dishes at Grazie which is 5 mins from this place."}
{"text":"Now that La Cascina is closed, this is the best Italian in North Toronto - always fresh, always some real attention in the cooking. Service very good; charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Took my cousin who was visiting toronto we had a lovely time. The patio is small and there is not much of a view but the food makes up for it! I would definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!! Went today for dinner and it was, dare I say, better than lunch.  I had the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese salad and the buffalo chicken.  To top it all off raspberry compote cheesecake.  The service was impeccable as always.  Very quiet, but then it was a Monday night and kind of early."}
{"text":"amazing italian authentic cuisine
great service 
tight quarters
been here twice and never disappointed
taking our son here for his bday
awesome grilled calamari and a spectacular zuppa pesche"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful brunch/lunch at La Vecchia today. I had delicious (Italian?) French toast with fresh strawberries and blueberries, while my friends ordered, and loved, the Linguini Mare. The wait staff were extremely busy but charming and efficient. Good service, pretty decor and reasonable prices for good food...among the reasons the place is hopping!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for 19:30 on a Wednesday evening. Arrived at 19:30. It was 5 minutes before we were acknowledged. Ten minutes later I questioned our 19:30 reservations which they confirmed. At 20:00 hours we had not been seated and there was no end in sight. We therefore left and had a very nice meal at Grazie's in the next block south on Yonge. We will never know if the food is as good as they say. We do know that as many others have said, the service is poor. I have never been to a restaurant having made reservations and not being close to being seated 30 minutes after said reservations. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place that makes you leave and all you can think about is giving them a positive review online.

I went this past Tuesday for a date, and arrived at 9pm. The restaurant was fairly busy with tables eating but I had made reservations on OpenTable and we walked right in no problem. 

Had the same server (no idea on the name) the entire time - from walking in to leaving, and he was absolutely perfect. I drink a lot of water and both the girl I was with & I were impressed that we'd take 2 sips, look away, and it would be full again. The food was out extremely fast, and the bread was OK (probably the only thing that could have been better on the night)

The food was very good as well, I had the 4 cheese gnocchi which is probably hard to screw up, but tasted delicious. There were more than a few items on the menu that I'd try on return visits. Our waiter recommended a good wine and made sure we had better value by getting a half litre instead of two glasses. 

Atmosphere was very cozy and romantic, but the service really brought it over the edge. We were there for upwards of 2 hours without a hint of being rushed out, even as the last regular table in the place (in fact our waiter even brought us a shot of something (don't remember) on the house after we finished). 

Wish I could remember his name so I could throw him some props, but I'll be back again soon and will get it then."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today and will likely not go back.  Food was just ok.  Service was pretty poor. 

I ordered the lunch size spinach and ricotta fresh agnolotti di monte.  The lunch sizes are called mini sizes and they seriously mean mini! My plate came with exactly five small pieces of pasta on it.  Five.  I was done eating in about 3 minutes.  The sauce tasted like bottled supermarket sauce.  The Parmesan they offer is overly salty and of the Kraft variety.  Overall it was certainly edible, but for $12 or whatever it was, it was a microscopic amount of food.  I am not even a big eater and often don't finish normal portion sizes at restaurants.  This was just ridiculous. 

My partner had the mini pizza Contadina.  This was a better size and came with a salad.  But the chicken on it was very dry and overall it was also just ok. 

Service: We had to wait for over 10 minutes without menus. Brought us room temperature water with a big lipstick lip print on one of the glasses.  Not a big deal, just asked for another one...except he never brought another one.  He made a couple of snarky comments at the beginning, ignored us for the rest of the meal (not because he was busy - he was just standing around and chatting) and then tried to turn on the charm after we asked for the bill."}
{"text":"First time going to the restaurant and was very impressed.  

The venue was smaller than expected, however, the atmosphere, customer service and food were excellent.

Very busy on a Friday night so I would suggest that you make reservations if you plan to go in advance.

Thanks to the restaurant staff for a great meal and a good evening at their restaurant!"}

Great for: any meal (patio); dates (inside restaurant)

Service: 4 / 5 
Food: 3 / 5
Atmosphere: 4 / 5 

--- COMMENTS --- 

Came here for a catch - up session with a friend. We had walked up from Davisville station to find a place to eat. This place caught our eye because of the patio and because we didn't feel like going to the Chinese fusion restaurant beside it. 

Friendly servers, we were sat and watered almost right away. It was a really hot day and we sat on the patio, so we were really happy to see the water. The server helped us lower the shade so we weren't in direct sunlight but didn't tell us the specials though. I'm (sadly enough) culturally ignorant about white food, so I was disappointed - I could've asked for recommendations, that's true, but meh. The menu covers were really cool - they were hardcover and looked like artsy books. 

The inside (before I forget) is really nice - they have simple chandeliers hanging, classy european decor. 

My friend and I decided to be healthy and get something from the insalate and antipasti section. 

He ordered:  DI POLLO - Grilled Chicken on organic greens marinated grilled vegetables tossed in balsamic $14 
Said the chicken was very good, moist and well seasoned - vegetables were fresh

I ordered: ANTIPASTO DI CASA Marinated vegetables, smoked salmon, seafood salad, prosciutto, goat cheese, pickled button mushrooms and warm herb focaccia $12.95. 
very colourful - with shrimp, squid, salmon, cheese, garlic bread, assorted veggies. I don't recommend getting this dish though - the vinaigrette was too lemony / sour for my liking. 

They didn't take debit (we overheard the server tell the people sitting next to us). and they don't do separate bills (but they will do separate payments). 

I'll definitely come back to try their pasta (our neighbours had pasta and stuff from the brunch menu)."}
{"text":"Franco the owner was rude and condescending, will never be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Yet another case where Yelp came through for me big time. I recommended this place, based solely on Yelp reviews, for a dinner for 6 to celebrate a family birthday.

Arriving I was happy to see it looked good. Dark wood, stone finish, floor to ceiling wine cabinets and lighting bright enough to easily see your whole party but dim enough to let you forget about other patrons. Warm summer nights mean the full front window is opened up, merging the sidewalk patio and interior dining area and making for a lovely breeze.

Service was fantastic. On a busy Friday night our table of six had as many as three people taking care of it, under the direction of a great waitress whose name I wish I could recall. Little details, like ensuring everybody always had water, were taken care of before any of us noticed they needed to be attended to.

Our meals spanned the range of daily special, seafood pasta, pizza, and veal chop with each dish delivering a consistently delicious experience. Even my boyfriend's grandfather, who has owned two five-star restaurants, was vocal about his enjoyment of the food.

La Vecchia seems like a great place for a date or a small group meal. Given the noise level I wouldn't recommend it for a group larger than six, though, unless you're okay with not being able to hear people seated down the table from you. Consider making a reservation as it was packed and you may find yourself disappointed if you have to make do with another local eatery after expecting to have dinner here."}
{"text":"I went here with no pretenses as it was recommended to have the best patio in the area.  The service was appalling however - the worst I I've had in Toronto. Food was fairly good though - shame I wont be returning."}
{"text":"My faves include fish with lemon sauce, mussels in tomato sauce, tiramisu, any pasta dish and risotto! They accommodate  to dietary restrictions as well. 

Service is sketchy but food is great. All servers seem to be fake!"}
{"text":"Attended La Vecchia for a birthday dinner on a busy Friday night.  We had a late 9pm reservation, but the place was still packed when we arrived.  They couldn't seat us until most of our party had arrived, but our table was ready when we met that requirement.  No problem.

The restaurant space itself is fairly small and cramped.  You really have to squeeze by on a busy night as tables take up all the available space.  The website describes the restaurant as \"cozy and romantic\".  Cozy, yes, very much so.  Romantic, not so much.  The place is very, very loud.  Maybe they mistook \"dark\" for \"romantic\".

Service was okay.  We had time to peruse the menu for drinks and food before ordering and our waiter was generally around to take care of our needs.  A couple of \"hmm\" moments did occur, though.  The bottle of wine I ordered came in a bucket with only an inch or two of ice in it.  Uh, okay?  A friend who had already eaten dinner ordered the mussels to split and was met with, \"On Friday nights, we usually ORDER FOOD\" from the waiter.  Meow!  It's the details that take service from adequate to great, and the details need some polish here.

The menu is quite varied and has all your Italian favourites.  I informally quizzed my tablemates about their dishes, and the common response was \"good\".  I had the minestrone and penne alla vodka.  On both counts, the cook seemed to be a bit too heavy handed with the salt as it overpowered the delicate taste of the vegetables in the soup and took over the pasta dish.  Other than the seasoning issue, both dishes were \"good\".  The pasta itself was perfectly cooked.  

All in all, La Vecchia is okay.  A few quibbles with the service and food, but you could do worse.  Just don't take your date on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Had prix fix which was not worth 50$. Service was slow, inattentive. Food was bland and unexciting."}
{"text":"I have been here to eat three times and one just to have a drink with my husband at the bar.  Each time I always walk away very happy.  The service here is great, very attentive and knowledgeable, the recommendations are spot on.  Try the grilled calamari believe me it is so buttery soft and amazing.  I always go with the special as it is very fresh and imaginative.  I find this place to be dark and cozy and romantic.  It is a great place for a date but also wonderful if you have people coming in from out of town, it is very impressive but not full of itself."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday afternoon

{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night.

We had no reservations.
After being turned down by an EMPTY restaurant across the street (they said they were fully booked up that night, but the place was huge and only 1 table was seated. I looked around and said to myself, \"that's cool, we'll go somewhere where they WANT our money\".

We get to this place. It's about 6:30pm. We have no reservations. It's packed already. The guy at the front door says \"ok, it'll be tough, but I'll find a way to get you in\". We were sitting within 2 minutes. 

We ordered an appetizer of prosciutto (sp?) wrapped prawns. Fantastic.

I had the 12 oz veal chop, on a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies. Fantastic.

My mom (who was visiting town so I took her out near her hotel) had a mushroom prawn risotto I believe. She said it was fantastic.

We had dessert. I had the Gelato La Vecchia (what I'm guessing is their signature dessert). It was vanilla ice cream (or gelato, I'm not sure. It's CALLED Gelato, but tasted like ice cream) with chocolate, caramel, and espresso shaved on top. My only complaint about it was that when it arrived it was already a little melted. I'm guessing it's because that place was absolutely PACKED and it was tough for the waiters to get around, so it just came to me a little late. No biggy, I would have liked it more solid, but I'll live.

It was also extremely noisy in there. It's a trendy place I guess, so there were lots of people there, and plenty more sitting at the bar waiting to be seated (likely including the people who's table we stole by not having reservations...) so I know what type of place it is, so I'd likely try to avoid going there on a Saturday night around 7pm because it's gonna hurt my ears. But the food was really good, and the star of the night was probably that prawn appetizer I mention above.

It's on the expensive side for a poor/cheap guy like me. Meat dishes were in the $20-$35 range, but they had pasta dishes in the $18 range. I saw a person at another table eating pasta and it looked like a huge portion. I would love to try it sometime.

Anyway, we had a good time, despite the noise. I approve of this place.

Win."}
{"text":"We went to La Vecchia last night to celebrate my husband's birthday.\"Best Birthday Dinner Ever\" is what my husband said. Grilled Calamari, for starter, Seafood linguini and seafood risotto. I'm still thinking about the wonderful meal and thanks to Jeff our waiter for great service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would give this a 4.5 out of 5. The reason it isn't getting a 5? Just a little bit tight to get around when it's packed. And it's always packed. Let's talk about the food and wine. Superb. They select their wines exclusively and they have a wonderful selection. The service and staff are amazing. Nice ambience. Great service. Great food. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love La Vecchia! I think it's one of the best Italian restaurants i have ever been to and i am always recommending it to my family and friends. Great atmosphere, great food, great service!! I love their sun dried tomato pizza and their calamari appetizer! The best!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for brunch and found the service and ambience to be great.  The decor is very attractive and appropriate for a romantic get together or a quiet meal between friends.  The walls are covered with eye-catching black and white photos of icons of the Italian cinema (Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Anna Magnani) and their is a separate coat room located at the back of the restaurant.  One can enjoy a leisurely meal/get together here on a Sunday afternoon, enhanced by pleasant and attentive wait staff.  The brunch food was tasty enough but I found the prices to be somewhat high given the portion sizes.  I am however basing my critique on the brunch/lunch menu items (pizza/salad combo and frittata).  I have not tried their other lunch items or any of their pastas, meats or fish items.  I would consider coming back and trying those.  Pizza was definitely tasty but this is what they are apparently known for."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I'm sure I'll come back. The first time I had a special of the night which was a pork shoulder over saffron risotto- DELICIOUS to the last bite. Recently i had this meat ravioli in a truffle sauce covered in a mountain of mushrooms. Amazing, really! Probably the best restaurant at the Yonge and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"I came to La Vecchia because of a friend's recommendation, so I had high hopes! 
 
Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed how dark it was and because I have really bad astigmatism, I was seeing dark spots everywhere. The host asked if we had a reservation, and we said no. He looks at his 'chart' and said \"Oh, you're lucky we have one last table in the back\" - which, by the way, is right in front of the washroom (with a cold draft during the whole meal). 

I was fine with our seating arrangement, except that there were plenty of empty tables that remained unoccupied till the end of our dinner...

Aside from the hostess coming off as pretentious, our server was actually quite pleasant. We ordered Bruschetta La Vecchia ($8.75) to start and it arrived at our table really quick. It was a dish that I probably could have made at home - the tomatoes were really cold and the bread was rock hard. I did not enjoy this appetizer at all. 

I ordered the Triangoli Toto ($16) as the entree which was Whole wheat triangle shaped pasta filled with spinach and mushroom in a basil tomato sauce. I couldn't finish this because the sauce was extremely salty.. It's upsetting that I had to pay so much for this dish. 

As I worked through my pasta, the bus boy continuously tried to clear the table before I was finished. I don't know why he was in such a rush to get us out because the restaurant was not that busy. 

We got the bill quickly because the draft from the back door was freezing cold and the staff taking the coats for customers keep whooshing by me.. 

I won't be coming here again. 

Tip: Don't bring in outside food/drinks. I had many staff members try and take my Tim Hortons cup away before I finished my coffee.. at least let me roll up the rim, sheesh.."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner once, and had a great time. I have to admit I was there with a friend who is related to a staff member, so I can't comment on the regular service, but I can comment on the food and ambience, both of which were amazing. As someone who is gluten-intolerant, I was THRILLED to find a good, Italian restaurant in my area that had rice pasta available as a substitute for regular wheat pasta."}
{"text":"Wonderful bday lunch with mom at La Vecchia.  Service is great.  

Food is good.  Pizza is hot and love how lunch pizza come with salad.  Pasta is great with shrimp, mussel, and squid.  We got the dinner portion pasta to share.  We also got the chocolate sauced strawberries crepe.  It was loaded with berries.  We've asked for the extra cream, and the server ask if we would like table or whip cream (and I said chantilly cream lol, as my vocabulary is limited when it comes to cream).

The decor and ambience is nice.

We will return soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Love the food even if it can be a bit pricey (for pizza). If you're ordering alcohol stick to the wine list. A disappointing selection of beers and the Old Fashioned I ordered looked and tasted more like a Shirley Temple."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! We had to make a last minute reservation for 6 people for Mother's Day lunch. Not only did they accommodate us we had a great experience!

The inside decor is very nice...the owners have gone to some effort to create a beautiful restaurant. Our waiter Kevin was fantastic...a real top notch waiter. The bruschetta was light and tasty, and the ricotta filled pasta in cream sauce was delicious. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for any Italian food lover!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and found the food consistently good.  The service however, is lacking.  A few of the servers have a bit of an attitude and some ignore you completely.  I get it, your busy but waiting 40 - 45 mins to get your bill is a bit much.  I was so frustrated I left without paying for my meal."}
{"text":"We went there on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. Fortunately we had a reservation. 
Overall, a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant. Service is really good and fast.
Food was just amazing, even though I'm not a food expert and I was really hungry at that time. We ordered pizza and now when I think about it it might have been a little greasy, or that was just the way it was supposed to be. Pasta was really good though.
The only drawback is that it's a little noisy inside, but I think that's how most restaurants are in Toronto.
I'd recommend it for anyone who wants delicious italian dinner with someone special."}
{"text":"Great place for casual meal.  Enjoyed a spinach salad and large piazza.  Would go back good good at very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I have been to La Vecchia twice so far, and every time the food has been amazing. The service is also very great. It is a nice restaurant with a romantic vibe, perfect for a date or just to go with your friends. 
The second time I was there I got the vegetarian pizza (which was really good) and the first time I got a dish with veal and mushrooms. I remember we also got a replica of that dish with lemon instead of mushroom which turned out to be way better. Still the quality of food and service you get here is really good regardless of what you order.
I will definitely go again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My parents first came here for brunch and they insisted on bringing me here the next time. So, after shopping at the nearby Sporting Life, my parents and I decided to go in for a late brunch. We were hoping to sit by the window, but all those seats were taken. Towards the back is a little darker, but we didn't mind.

We felt splurgy so we decided to order a bottle of Veuve for brunch. We all started out with soups (Tuscan style) and slurped it embarrassingly fast. I had the Ravioli which anything with \"mushroom truffle butter\" is something I am going to go for. This dish did not disappoint: I like my Ravioli's big and full of stuffing so it really hit the spot. Both my parents had the Linguini Mare and they too were not disappointed.

Service was absolutely incredible. I forgot our waiter's name (and my parents had that same guy before) but he was en pointe. I would highly recommend La Vecchia for brunch and I can't wait to try this place for dinner!"}

{"text":"La Vecchia came on high recommendation from friends in the area and let me tell you, we were not disappointed! 

We of us showed up on a Saturday evening around 8:30pm without reservations. There were two groups in front of us but we got away with only a 15 minuter wait (during which time we were invited to sit at their bar and order a drink while we perused their menu. Our initial impression was very positive and it only got better from there. 

We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the door, and shockingly didn't feel a draft from the cold outside air at all. 

La Vecchia has a fabulous ambiance. It is both classy and cozy, full without feeling crowded, and the noise level and lighting are perfect. A very romantic way to spend an evening.

We were similarly impressed with the presentation and taste of our food, as well as our lovely waiter who brought us drinks courtesy of the house to finish our meal off with. 

Overall my friend's recommendation was spot on. This place was one of the better restaurants in the area and one I would strongly recommend (especially over Alize!)"}
{"text":"Cozy and elegant little mid town restaurant with a great menue and fair prices.

Enjoyed the scallop and shrimp risotto, and will come back to try a pasta next time.

Lovely rustic fancy decor inside, good service, great food for value."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that fine dining is an experience and it's not just about the food. If this was a review just about the food I would give this review a 3 star rating because the food was not bad and just about average. My experience with the staff and particularly a gentleman who claimed to be the owner was quite disappointing. It was a Saturday night and my date and I came in as walk in clients without a reservation. We were told there was a 20 minute wait and we said \"no problem,\" and went for a walk. We came back as prompted just to be told to wait 5 minutes more... 5 minutes go by and then we asked for our table and were told 5 more minutes again... And again.. And again... 

When I voiced my concerns to the owner he talked to us in a very CONDESCENDING and ARROGANT way telling us such things as \"hey we are a busy restaurant lot of people want to eat here and you have to wait.\" His arrogance is unjustified by the quality of the food. We ended up staying because my date insisted we may as well but then we also experienced the creepy invasive service that another reviewer described. I guess this is their way of trying to make up for bad first impressions. Really uncomfortable stuff like coming to tap me on the shoulders like we are long time pals and unsolicited physical contact. Not needed not welcome. 

I wouldn't recommend it in particular. Specially not on a weekend when there is many other choices for better food in the area."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with a group of friends and the place was packed to the brim. 

I ordered the soup special which was the potato and leek soup and the Linguini Frutti Di Mare. The potato and leek soup was alright as it came lukewarm and it tasted like a typical cream soup. The linguini frutti di mare was the seafood pasta with tomato sauce. The pasta noodles were great and it really complements well with mussels and shrimps. Overall, the pasta was definitely the highlight of my meal.

My friend ordered the capricciosa pizza and it was a huge letdown. For some reason, the dough itself was very salty especially the crust part and with the added toppings like italian sausage, it made it much more saltier. Definitely stay away from the pizzas at this place.

Also, stay away from the dessert menu as I tried the caramel crunch. It comes in a huge piece but don't let that size fool you on the taste. There was more cream than the meringue itself and the cream overpowered the entire slice of cake. 

The service was decent as our waiter was quick to refill water and the food came in a timely manner."}

{"text":"Petit restaurant italien situé à 5 minutes d'Eglinton station. Le service ici est traditionnel avec serveurs en tablier et musique traditionelle.
Au menu grand choix de pizzas, pâtes et antipasti : je recommande celui au saumon, mozarella et jambon fumé!

//Nice little restaurant located at 5 minutes walk from Eglinton station. Traditional ambiance with waiters wearing black aprons and italian music like you can hear in the movies.
The menu is huge : pizzas, pasta but I do recommend the antispati with salmon, mozarella and smoked ham!"}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago, and were impressed with service, food, and atmosphere. Very nice size portions and excellent menu, with lots to choose from. Even my finicky mother-in-law loved it there, which is a BIG deal in our family.
We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and was looking forward to going again for dinner during the week but unfortunately on the Wednesday evening I went the restaurant was very busy and we waited about 30-40 minutes for a seat. The host didn't update us on the wait and acted annoyed when I asked for menus while we waited at the bar. The host acted as if we were a bother but happily greeted the older guests. However, our server friendly and welcoming. The food was ok, I had the penne alla vodka which was decent and my friend had the rigatoni romani which was much too salty. With all the other options in this area, I likely won't be going back here."}
{"text":"I originally planned to take my Girlfriend to another restaurant with a proper valentines day package.  Im glad I didnt.  La Vecchia was better in every aspect imaginable.  The atmosphere is quaint, and romantic, with a hint of trendiness.  We didnt have to wait for a table.  The wine list is impressive for such a small establishment.  We started with a martini.  Martinis only get eight out of ten only because i ventured with a new one and combinations of flavours didnt strike me.  The caprese salad with bufalo mozzarella was exquisite.  The shrimp appetizer was like no shrimp i had ever had.  The meat ravioli was mouth watering.  The beef tenderloin was so tender than my butter knife had no problem hacking it, and it was delicious.  The caramel crunch dessert was innovative and delectible.  The Gelato a la vecchia is the best gelato with espresso in the city.  The service was impeccable.  Our cutlery and plates were removed after every course expediously.  The staff are very friendly.  Everyting was spic and span.  We even ended up paying $120 less than i would have at the other place."}
{"text":"Finally made it over here, and I'm glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. 

For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I'm having it with a larger meal. 

We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. 

For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn't like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn't heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. 

Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night. She came with me downstairs to the bathroom as I am on crutches and offered to help me inside. She honestly made the experience memorable, and I hope the restaurant does read this, as she deserves a lot of credit."}
{"text":"I visited this place for brunch. Overall the interior is the best feature. However there were some major issues with the service. There were only a few customers yet they really struggled to visit our table while a few employees were just walking around with no tables to serve. Then they brought our coffee and tea in dirty dishes. The portion of the brunch was also on the smaller side with just average quality and presentation. I don't think it is worth trying!"}
{"text":"La Vecchia has a wonderful ambience to it. The decor is very well done. The whole place is quite classy; yet not snobby in the least. The service is wonderful. The servers are very attentive and extremely friendly. 

The food is very good. I usually stick to pizza in Italian restaurants (and theirs is pretty good); however, their pasta is out of this world!

Although the main dishes are reasonably priced; I found their desserts and specialty coffees to be quite overpriced - which is La Vecchia's only real downfall in my opinion; yet it is an important downfall. The fact that one dessert (the vast majority are $8.95 each) with a specialty coffee ($9.50) costs nearly $20.00 (before tax) together, ends up discouraging me from getthing them, and therefore, puts a bit of a damper on my dining experience. Overall, though, I did like La Vecchia."}
{"text":"Was my first time to this spot and the hype wasn't disappointing. 

I went here Saturday at 7:30, we tried to make a reservation but they were booked, we were encouraged to walk in anyway and after a short 15 minute wait were seated. 

The service was amazing and timed perfectly, although I personally probably could of waited between my appetizer course and entree I was happy with the level of service.

I appreciate a server who knows when to chat and who knows when to dismiss. We were on a date and had no intensions of making friends with our server - and I suppose he could tell so he bowed out and let us continue chatting. 

The place was packed - so be prepared if you're wanting a quite place, it is lively but still romantic enough with the dim lights and rustic glam feel.

The food was also great, I had the calabrese salad to start which was delicious and came with a side of mixed greens. my entree was the agnolotti di monte which was half mooned shaped pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach - delish for this petite girl, about 8 pieces.

My partner in crime had the pesce pagello - red snapper lightly seared, topped with a lemon garlic sauce over mixed organic greens in a balsamic dressing. I had more than one bite - it was insane and perfectly cooked.

After dinner and our bottle of wine we lost track of time, we were seated at our table for more than 3 hours total when the owner asked us if we could move to the bar ... before I got defensive (there were other tables, but a party walked in and we were in the way - I get it) the owner said we could drink for free the rest of the evening lol.

I appreciate great customer service and loyalty, I will be back shortly as everything on the menue looks devine!"}
{"text":"I returned to La Veccia and everything was amazing!

The service, food and atmosphere were perfect! They added a second floor and it was less crowded than it usually is. They also added nice new bathrooms. 

I highly recommend the smoked chicken penne. 

I had the fish of the day, Chilean sea bass. It was well seasoned and delicious. 

I recommend la Veccia !"}
{"text":"First of all, you have to admire the ambiance of this place.  It's such an odd mish-mash that somehow manages to work together.  Think: gothic mansion meets Ikea modern (lights) meets 1950's black and white movie photos.  Who thought to put these things together?  Yet it oddly feels cohesive in this warm italian cave-like restaurant.  And did I mention the grey and black paisley suspenders that the waitstaff wear?  Awesome.

Service was incredibly fast and very attentive.  Our waiter did the \"sparkling or still?\" water upsell but was gracious when we just asked for tap.  He recited the specials of the day with aplomb.  He also checked in on us throughout the meal unobtrusively to make sure we were happy.  Great service.

The food itself was better than I expected.  Spinach, mushroom and goat cheese salad was nothing special, but a perfectly decent start to the meal.  Since it was obvious that my husband and I were sharing it, the waitstaff split it for us onto two generous plates without being asked.  Love those little extra attentive touches.  The Linguine Frutti Di Mare was terrific.  A rich, tomatoey, slightly acidic sauce that didn't overpower the generous shellfish.  Calamari, clams, muscles and scallops were all perfectly cooked - not a chewy bite in the entire dish.  The Penne Arrabbiata was spicy and full of dense black olives.  Rigatoni Romani was, according to my friend, \"Rich, but not heavy.  Not too cheesy, not too smoky - but nicely cheesy and smoky\"  Hmm.  I'll take him at his word that he enjoyed it - he happily ate the whole thing.  Gamberi Del Conte was \"light and lemony,\" according to my other friend.  The pasta was not fresh, but it was cooked perfectly.

On the whole, a very good restaurant experience.  Food and service were both highly generous.

Vegetarian score = 8/10. Lots of choices between the apps, pastas and pizzas and very good variety."}
{"text":"It was a nice place but I don't think I'll be returning. The atmosphere is very nice and service is great! However the portions are quite small and quite expensive, which was kind of expected as it is a classier restaurant. However, there are other Italian places where the food is just as good and much less expensive. It was a nice place but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The food is really delicious and don't forget to get the dessert surprise for 4. We were overloaded!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant at Yonge n Eglinton. Authentic Italian cuisine like you've never tasted. I had a mushroom pasta, and it was so extraordinary I had to get up at tell the manager. You can tell they put their heart and soul into their food. It tastes like it came straight from mamas kitchen! Magnifico!"}
{"text":"With so many cute places to eat on the Yonge & Eglinton area, I once more made use of Yelp to look for the best choice and, boy, was I not disappointed.

We went there on a Saturday afternoon, and while the lunch menu is not big, I was extremely pleased with my choices.

For starters, I ordered the caprese salad. I don't care about salads but I ordered that to join my wife, but man, I would have that salad as a meal every day. Everything was great about it, but I have to mention the tomatoes, extremely juicy and mouthwatering.

Then I ordered the salsiccia focaccia, which was awesome. Again, I do not love foccacia bread because it's always kinda tough and bland but this one was soft and savory, you could taste the herbs and spices of the bread.

My wife wasn't overwhelmed by her choices, and I'll have to say that her salad was not as good as mine, but the gnocchi that she ordered had a fantastic texture and taste. The sauce was too bland for her, but I enjoyed the taste of real tomatoes.

The service was great, if it wasn't for the lack of accent, I would say that the server was taken right off of a mafia movie, friendly, galant and bold at the same time. The indoor decor is simply gorgeous.

I have only two small complaints: I guess it's the most expensive non-refill pop I've ever paid ($3.50 a glass), and the bread that they serve at the start seems to be taken out of a Wonder Bread bag. It's not enough to take away one of their five stars."}
{"text":"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was 4/5. For a few reasons, I have been dining at Le Vecchia for years. I know I come back solely for the gnocchi. 

Tonight the 4 stars are 100% for Alex, the server. He made the half hour wait past our reso time worth the wait. He knew all of the specials, made excellent recommendations and knew Italian food. 

The wine was outstanding. The gnocchi was ok - this time. But the ambiance and evening was on point. Although the dim lighting made me feel like I was 67. 

We would come back for Alex and the pepper mill."}
{"text":"You won't go wrong inviting out-of-towners to this place, or hitting it up if you're nearby--the Yelp reviews are overall correct.  BUT if you expect a little sumthin extra special for a place with $17-23 entrees (which one CAN get in Toronto), you may be underwhelmed.

This was a small hike north from Eglinton Station.  A lot of the right notes were hit for us:  friendly, thoughtful servers, sufficient number of Italian-stereotype movie posters, dark enough lighting to suppose your food is rich and your date is handsome :)

The food came slow despite ordering before a rush.  And it wasn't amazing, which is not an indictment, just anti-climactic.  Probably, we had the wrong expectations.  None of our dishes tasted like handmade pasta (maybe they weren't supposed to be)--just perfectly cooked boxed pasta.  The sauces, across 3 dishes (lamb meat sauce, tomato and a cream blend), tasted like they might not really have had the time to really diffuse their flavours properly.  The pizza--we shared a quattro stagioni, was tasty, but there was no signature to it.

This place does the job for the finicky who just want a nice pasta dinner.  For the Torontonian who has had serious, hair-pullingly, lapels-shaking full-bodied Italian, I wanted a reason to keep coming back to The Old Lady."}

It was a good place to bring a date or to come with a group of girl friends. 

Service is awesome. Waiter was nice and professional. They knew their menu well and provided valuable advice about the food choices.

Food:
Appetizer: Grill shrimp wrapped with one kind of bacon: it was good but quite expensive. 4 piece of tiger shrimp was $24. 

Main:
We order pasta and Veal. Both of them are good. 

Overall food is good and price is reasonable compared to similar type of restaurants. However nothing really outstanding. That's why i only gave 3 star."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite heavily advertised, even here on yelp. Nevertheless, it was a good experience.

We sat on the mini terrace, beside the sidewalk where you can watch the passers-by but the interior looked pleasant as well, even if a bit crowded.

We had the tomato and mozzarella di bufala salad which was not particularly special, but enjoyable and the Caesar salad likewise.
The lobster and shrimp risotto was special however; pieces of cracked lobster still in its shell abounded in the risotto which was thick with the rich tomato sauce.
We had the halibut which was a fraction overcooked, but still good, expensive at $36.
The carrot cake and ice cream desert was fine.

We drank a perfectly acceptable New Zealand sauvignon blanc for $50 per bottle.

The service was informed, swift and pleasant.

Allow $100+ per head"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Very romantic and cozy. Good high end service. Food is great. I mainly tried pastas and I liked them!"}
{"text":"Food is good  so let's start off there.   Menu is not overly complex and enough choices.  The negatives? Had a reservation and we still had to wait almost 30 minutes.  There was an open table in the corner that sat there most of the time we were waiting  and then we get whisked away to the basement in a private room where they setup multiple tables. It was loud as there was a large group there and we found it difficult to talk as the acoustics were awful and we waited some time for our food (I am guessing 20- 30 minutes)
This would probably get a 4 or 5 if I went when it was not busy but felt like they wanted to jam the place to the rafters and make extra money which I understand but don't put people in that room if there is a large group."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place fo a gathering.  She had her bridal shower here and it's easy to see why, the interior is elegant with old-world charm, service is attentive, and food is delicious.  

The risotto porcini is creamy, the kiwi risotto doesn't taste as weird as it sounds. The fruit increases the acidity of the white wine sauce but it's mixed in, you don't actually see chunks of it.  The seafood linguine is spot on too, al dente with lots of seafood.  Overall, portion is not big, but they pack it with lots of ingredients rather than pasta.  The tiramisu though doesn't quite follow up the excellent entrees."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I've been here a few times - all their pasta is on point. The staff is so friendly, the customer service is excellent and the vibe is great at night. 

In the summer, their small patio is perfect for people-watching at lunch. 

Just writing about this place makes me want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience trying to book a reservation for a large group. They rip you off - charging a set menu of $50 - 1 salad (reg $11)  and 1 pasta ($16) which doesn't even add up to $50 on their a la carte menu! I will never book here. Does the manager think we can't do math?! Absolutely insulted."}
{"text":"After coming back a second time, this place is consistently good in terms of service and food. The decor seemed a bit on the older side, but it was a really nice and warm atmosphere. I had the Rigatoni Romani ($22) which was bomb, and my boyfriend had the Penne Alla Vodka ($19) which was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I've haven't had food this good in such a long time. If you've ever wronged anyone you should bring them here. Every course was magnificent and the wine was delicious. The wine was priced accordingly. I'm going to go back as soon as possible. The food is so deadly good. The stuffed calamari is outstanding and the pastas were both outstanding. The gelato La Vecchia was so tasty and refreshing. I had to stop every few minutes to really take in what I was enjoying. I can't wait to go back and try everything!"}
{"text":"We came here for a goodbye party and the place was packed on a Thursday evening.  We walked into the restaurant and it was a very small restaurant but had a very romantic setting with nice chandeliers and candles at every table.  I loved the ambience of this restaurant once I stepped foot inside.  We were greeted right away by a gentlemen whom took us to our table and they were nice enough to take our jackets and hang them up for us.  While waiting for the rest of our guests to arrive, I had a look through the menu and we were served fresh slices of bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It took a while to get our waiter to take our orders but we were patient as they were really busy.  I ordered the Cozze Marinara (mussels) with the wine garlic lemon essence.  For my main course, I went with their Ravioli De Niro (jumbo meat ravioli in a butter wild mushroom truffle essence sauce).  I thought everything tasted really delicious and tasteful.   I was also really pleased with the customer service that all the waiters provided, considering how busy they were.  The gentlemen who took our orders knew the menu pretty well.  He was able to thoroughly explain all the daily specials.  He was also very welcoming, professional, and charismatic.  We also ended up getting a couple of Sambuca shots and the waiter went above and beyond to light our shots as we requested.  When it came to separating the bills, we had a little bit of a hiccup because we were told that we had to let him know before ordering that we wanted separate bills.  I'm sure everyone has experienced difficulty when trying to get everyone to pitch in for their portion when everyone has a different method of payment.  Who even carries large amounts of cash in their wallets anymore?  In the end, he was able to coordinate separate bills for everyone and impressively enough, he was also able to remember everything that everyone ordered for the most part.  After the bill was settled, they gave us complimentary Lemon Drop shots for everyone and wished our friend the best of luck in her new endeavours.. How awesome is that! I definitely had an amazing experience and I will definitely come back to La Vecchia!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday and absolutely loved it. We all ordered different pasta dishes and thought it was amazing. I especially liked the bruschetta. I went with the Spaghetti Ortolana for my main course. It had roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes in it. The sauce was just right - not watery but not too chunky. Absolutely wonderful.

The atmosphere was lovely. Lots of mood lighting for anyone who may want to bring a date. Yet not overly romantic that you can't have a small group of friends like we had."}
{"text":"We always have a good time at La Vecchia. The pizzas are the best...that is what I would recommend. We like the arugula or the chicken garlic."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE! We recently moved to Yonge and Englington and have made La Vecchia our go to dinner date every weekend. Service is always superb with a wait staff who actually engages with the table and offers great meal suggestions. You can never go wrong with the specials. My husband doesn't even look at the menu, just chooses one of the specials every single time and then raves about it the entire meal. La Vecchia also has a nice wine list. Since we usually consume one bottle each visit some of the servers now recommend wine based off of our past consumption. The French waiter has the best wine knowledge and always steers us right! 
Reservations are highly advised on the weekends. The bar is small and not roomy enough to wait for a table so you're better off making a reservation or come around 9pm when the dining room starts to clear out. We were there til midnight the other night and never felt rushed. They take good care of their customers and seem to have a lot of regulars. 
Some of my favorites - grilled calamari and tiger shrimp for apps. Love the green salad with mushrooms. Any pasta! Veal chop - Wow. And then dessert. Haven't had one we haven't liked yet! 
The last time we were in I watched as we were waiting for our table. The staff is very efficient and quickly moving here and there but yet the diners are super relaxed and having a great time. It's a great restaurant when the staff is exhausted at the end of the night but the diners never had a clue about what it took for them to have that amazing meal with such wonderful personal service. 
La Vecchia does it right!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! It has more of an upscale/traditional vibe. We got the grilled calamari to start, the fish of the day and the agnolotti di monte. While the calamari dish was on the smaller side, it was cooked perfectly. Everything else was delicious. Will be returning."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad I can say about this restaurant experience. The ambience is dark and romantic with a fab wine/drink menu and good portion sizes that are so tasty I ate the entire thing (moderately embarrassing..). Just ensure you have a reservation because this place gets PACKED!"}
{"text":"We came here for my boyfriend's birthday. I made reservations prior to and still had to wait about 30 mins for our table to be ready.

The food was decent but not extraordinary or worth the price tag. 

The waiter was what made this an awful experience. I believe his name was Alessand. He was so snooty and rude to our friends. When he gave us the bill he made sure to mention how much tip he expected for our party of 6 (more than 18%). Afterwards he even refused to do separate bills and lectured us on how to make things easier for him by stating first before ordering to get separate bills. In the end after we took too long calculating how much each of us would pay he just decided to do the separate bills that he initially said he couldn't do!!! 

If you want a nice intimate atmosphere but with horrible service and mediocre tasting food then come here, but I will not spend my money here again."}
{"text":"Went their tonight with the family without reservations. Got seated quickly as the patio was the only thing available which was really tight and the chairs were not so comfortable.
Food was excellent, but service was slow....that's why a 4 rating was give combined with the crammed patio space, otherwise it would have been a 5 . All 3 of our meals were tasteful, hot and ample.
Would definitely go back, but not on the patio."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is excellent and although the space is a bit small, it is cozy, and the service is always top notch. Have had brunch and dinner here and both left me craving another visit! Frittata for brunch was delish, and risotto for dinner was one of the very best I've had in the city.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Small quaint dining with phenomenal food and service. What a find."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with my largest personal vexation when it comes to restaurants and this place had it in spades. I can not stand it when the server makes a single person of the party feel more important than everyone else at the table. The only time this does not apply is when it is warranted to have that person feel important, IE their birthday, them getting a promotion, new job, new something, etcetc. 

When a restaurant, such as this one, is trying to pull off the image of being a little more classy than the rest by taking my coat at the door, and pulling out the chairs...Ya know, all that stuff. However, when I am in my seat, and the waiter takes an abnormally engaging involvement in my friend over myself, it destroys any ambiance they are trying to pull off. And that's what happened here. The waiter would barely look at me during our orders, would take the info I gave him and move on, however, speaking with my friend, he was all ears and suggestions and how great her choices were and how much he enjoyed the same dish. I had to sit there in uncomfortable silence while they had a little banter back and forth about how much the ravioli trumps the risotto. Hey Spivey.. Bugger off, this isn't your date is it? Halfway through the entire meal she did take a larger notice to this and even mentioned it herself about how it seemed very rude that he wasn't really caring about the fact I was there and would only focus on her, kneeling down, putting his arms on the back of her chair, all the moves you would expect some sleazeball to be doing. The difference is you are a waiter, save your moves for when your shift is done and the girl you're making a move on some dumb girl that will fall for that.

So with that out of the way.

The food was fantastic. We ordered the Garlic Mussels in wine sauce, Penne Vodka, and Ravioli Di Niro. Everything tasted superb and everything that could not be finished was taken home. The bowl of mussels was very substantial for the price and after we were done eating the meat, the broth at the bottom was good enough for us to finish off like a soup, it was even fantastic with dipping the bread in it.  My Penne Vodka was cooked perfectly to Al dente and I had them add a little bit of Parmesan, it filled everything out excellently. Good flavors all around, nothing too overpowering and it all meshed together. The di Niro was flavorful and the mushroom butter sauce with truffle essence made my friend savor each bite since she adores mushrooms. Each one was quite substantial in size and there were about 6 of them on her plate. She ended up taking 2 of them home. 

Food wise everything was fantastic and I would not mind coming back here again. It is within walking distance to her home and the menu has many more things I would like to try (Kiwi Risotto for example). What I cannot abide by is the fact that the server made me feel like an outcast, pouring all the attention to my date as though that would help his chances, all it did was hurt his tip."}
{"text":"The service was delightful, bread fresh and cocktails were delicious. However, the food was mediocre and I could have made it myself at home. I had the shrimp linguini which was well prepared pasta, though a small amount, and the shrimp tasted as though they were previously frozen. We also had the zuppa de pesce with a bland tomato base and seafood that was small and not so fresh. Dessert was fine. Okay place, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The service was attentive without being intrusive, and the food was delicious.  The wine list had plenty of options, as did the main menu.  Plenty of salads, pastas and meat entrees to choose from.  I ordered the caprese salad and the mushroom risotto.  The caprese was a very generous portion, and while the risotto was a bit oily, the flavors were fantastic.  Very rich, but very good.  My friends were all happy with their choices, and while we wanted to order something off of the dessert menu, we were far too full.  I'm definitely saving room next time, as the desserts all looked swoon-worthy."}
{"text":"This is my current favourite restaurant. Such a wonderful atmosphere (kind of like a little cave inside!) and the food is perfect. 
My first time going they asked us to move tables in order to fit in a larger crowd that showed up unexpectedly, and since I'm really easy going I didn't mind at all! But the waiters/staff kept apologizing for the \"hassle\" and at the end gave us a delicious free shot. What a way to a girl's heart :)

I have nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Made reservations here for a Saturday dinner with hubby. The place looked beautiful in pictures and in person and offered GLUTEN FREE options, as well was near the. Ensue we were headed next.

We were greater at the door and seated right away, the service was good and the decor was beautiful as mentioned earlier.
The place got crowded very quickly and all tables were arranged. Dry close to one another. The place is open concept, very dark and got noisy very quickly. 
I watched the owners as they were always on the main floor and were regulating staff and attending to the clientele, which was refreshing. The food was brought to us quickly and the boss boys cleared the table as soon as the plates were empty. The food tasted fairly good but not outstanding compared to our many experiences with Italian restaurants.

However there were A few flaws, that require attention, when our server came to take our order he refused to place our appetizer order inn first as he preferred to take the whole order upfront. I asked him to please put it inn as we need time to look over the menu and were restricted for time and would like to get the order going, he came back shortly after speaking to the kitchen and said, ok they would do it but prefer to take it all at once as the restaurant is about to get very busy and the kitchen would get slammed (not our problem really, and found that to be an odd pressured request) we ordered the grilled calami which was made and brought to us fairly quickly, it tasted very good and tender a bit on the sweet side and the portion could ha e been slightly more generous  (as compared to other restaurants). We later ordered the mains, we both got the Veal, I got the lemon and my husband got the creamy mushroom version (don't remember the official names)
The food was good but a bit bland, mostly the potatoes and veggies that really needed some flavour as well as the veal seemed a bit over cooked and not as tender as expected.
We ended up getting the dessert as well, which we don't always do... I had the option of the gluten free chocolate cake which tasted ok and  very much like the frozen cakes from longos, and my husband got the ice cream which they pour the espresso over which was actually very good. 
We also got 1 order of penne a la vodka (gluten free) for take out, and have to say it tasted  like a very basic pasta smothered in tomatoes sauce with a bit of green onion didn't taste any seasoning or the pancetta.... also the noodles were un-evenly cooked as some were very soft and some had a bit of a crunch..... did not taste like a professional cooked it!

As we requested for the bill we received a complimentary limoncello shot, which was a nice gesture. With our bill being over $200 it seemed like a decent and pleasant gesture.

Over all not a bad experience many plus and few minus, perhaps a more experienced chef could fix all the problems we've encountered. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went with my family to celebrate an occasion. This place is amazing for this purpose: great service, delicious food and wine, lovely atmosphere. 
I forgot the name of our server but he is very helpful with the menu...he definitely knows the good wine as well. Overall 5 star restaurant and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times and I was never disappointed. The last time I came here I had their special pasta of the day which was rigatoni in a reduced lobster and crab rose sauce with seared Scallops, yes it was as tasty as it sounds, although a tad salty. Service was also decent.  It's a fancier version of grazies with more choices on the menu."}
{"text":"First impression from the outside it is a very nice restaurant. We had a reservation for 4 and walked inside the first time. The host had no smile and make me felt not friendly at all. After we were seated the waiter came and he was good. Very alert and very friendly. The food was pretty good . I give a 3 1/2 star. The mussel we had was very tiny but the sauce was delicious. the veal I had was tasty but the rice had a little more watery then it should. The sea bass my wife had was pretty good but nothing special. The atmosphere was good. Lot of people until 10pm. I think the waiter made it happen for us for the most then the food. The host should be more friendly. We might come back."}
{"text":"I stopped going to this restaurant several years ago, after our group of eight people was told to leave after two hours, this being the maximum time allowed, in order to make space for subsequent diners.  That would have been ok, I guess, except that this was not mentioned when we made our reservation.  Our lower-than-average tip reflected our displeasure, but it was questioned by the server!!

Anyway, I decided to give the place another chance on a recent Saturday night.  Arriving early for our 8:30 reservation, we had planned to have a drink at the bar, but this proved impossible as all the seats were taken, and we had to stand in the narrow aisle between the bar and the tables, being constantly buffeted (rather rudely) by the servers.

The smallish space was crammed to capacity and very noisy, so we accepted an outdoor table on the front patio.  Menus appeared promptly and the server was pleasant.

We didn't have to wait long for our orders, but on receiving mine, I wished that we had waited longer if that would have enabled the chef to spend more time and care preparing mine.   The menu described the dish as \"Scaloppine al Limone.  Veal scaloppini in a lemon sauce served with grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes\".  I was presented with too many slices of sad grey veal, concealing a tiny quantity of vegetables and roast potatoes hidden underneath.  The \"lemon sauce\" revealed no trace of lemon, or anything else, except a too-generous addition of salt.  I suggested that this item should be vastly improved, or removed from the menu.

The reaction was polite and responsive, and the cost of the dish was removed from our bill, which was much appreciated.

Sadly, though, not enough to persuade us to return to La Vecchia any time soon! :(

N.B.   When you receive your bill, you will find that the prices stated on the online menu have been raised considerably."}
{"text":"love this place
ambience- warm, romantic, authentic with the European flair
food - consistently very good
price point - rightly priced for the quality and quantity
service level - consistently excellent 

this place is great for dates during the evening, or lunch time is excellent for a group of friends to meet and catch up on the weekend
I've been to this restaurant several times and would certainly go back there again and again... both for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"A large group of us came here for my brother's new job celebratory dinner. Although everything was good, the maître d's manners left a lot to be desired. Two people from our group were running late (no more than 15 minutes late), and although I understand the need to turn tables quickly, we weren't just sitting there occupying the table for no reason. We had already ordered wine and tried to order appetizers and salads for the table, but was told that we had to place our entire order at once. During these 15 minutes, our waiter handled the situation well, but the maître d' glared at us more than once and hissed at our waiter to tell us that \"they only have two hours, then they're out\"... Well within hearing distance from us. So rude; completely unnecessary and inappropriate behavior! 

(Also note that we were done with dinner before the two hours were up.)

There are so many good (and better) Italian restaurants in the city with better service... Not sure who hired that maître d', but he could use a refresher course in how to do his job properly."}
{"text":"This was more of a 3-1/2 star experience for me the first time. The food was great, service was not. 
I'll start with the service.
I went for a another birthday get-together (3 birthday girls!). Granted we had no reservations, our party of 8 waited about 1hr before we were finally seated. It was a TUESDAY night! One of the birthday girls was really upset, mainly because the manager told us that we were getting a table within 15-20 mins as the other party had paid already. We quickly realized this was not the case as we looked around at the possible places they could have sat us and saw that the other customers were just starting on their appetizers!!! Half our group was ready to walk out. I can understand not wanting to lose an 8-top on a slow night but how about losing out on repeat customers? What ticked a birthday girl off even more was that, after we were finally seated, it took them another 20 minutes for them to just get our water glasses filled and by this point, the restaurant was half empty. When our food arrived, 2 people were served while the rest of us had to wait a good 25 mins for the rest of the food. With most of our group being servers or having been in the restaurant biz, we were not impressed.

Okay, now for some positive stuff. I loved LOVED the food here. Most of it was fantastic except the bread which I wasn't crazy about. Anyone who knows me will tell you of my love for good bread. A friend and I shared a seafood pasta and the La Vecchia  pizza. The crust was thin and crisp just drooping with the weight of the toppings. The pasta was just saucy enough with the seafood cooked to perfection. The mussels my friend ordered were fantastic. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I was told they don't do anything for birthday when I asked but they did comp us a dessert for the birthday girl (as 1 of the 3 did not order dessert). I would come back just because the food is so good. Most likely not in a party bigger than 4. 

Bottom Line: Fantastically yummy food but not good for large parties."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite places in the city! Romantic and spectacular ambiance. Amazing service with a personal touch. Fresh delicious pastas and specials. Excellent private dealer wine menu. 

Tip: Always get a reservation for dinner Thurs-Sat. Favourite sharing app: antipasto. Favourite main: Rigatoni Romani."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. In fact I often think about my meals here long after I've finished them...I'm talking weeks after. I've had several different pasta dishes and I honestly think I could order anything and it would be amazing. I always order the spinach and goat cheese salad to start with, it's the best salad I've ever had. 

The atmosphere is dark and romantic and the staff is very knowledgable and friendly.
I'm not sure if this is a regular thing for every table but each time I've gone, our waiter brings us a strawberry champagne after the meal, on the house. 

For the price you pay, which is about the $30-60 range (depending on what drinks you order/appetizers etc.), it is extremely well worth it.

I search for occasions for which to make a reservation here (reservations are a must as this place is packed and I have waited 45 minutes for a table before...worth it though).

Go make a reservation and pick anything!"}
{"text":"Great food and vibe!
The staff was fantastic.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"La Vecchia has a dark and charming ambiance which lends its beauty to those interested in a drink on a patio as well as an authentic Italian meal. It can get pretty crowded but the staff is alert and ready to accommodate to all needs. 
     I ordered the spaghetti ortolana and the pesce orata to go with a chianti wine. The spaghetti was delicious and bursting with flavour, ingredients like roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes were swimming in the decedent sauce and worked together in harmony with every bite. There was a bit of a wait for the pesce Orata but you can't rush a beautiful thing. The fish was soft and flavourful with the perfect balance of lemon and garlic. 
     Staff was friendly and attentive. A great experience."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant with a very intimate (read date spot) decor. The grilled calamari as an appetizer was excellent but the caesar salad I wouldn't get again. For main courses, we tried out the 4 cheese gnocchi and the angel hair pasta. Both dishes were top notch, although the gnocchi may require you to be rolled out as it's incredibly rich."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with 6 people. The seafood pasta special was described by our server as being rigatoni with scallops and lobster for $28.00, which I ordered. It came with one solitary scallop, and a small part of another piece. I could not find a single piece of lobster.  We called over our server who said that it was lobster meat in the sauce, and not pieces of lobster, which he did not explain when initially describing the specials. You could not detect the taste of any lobster in the sauce so I could not verify how much if any lobster the sauce actually contained.  Overall, everyone said their meals were ok.  For the prices they charge you want more than an ok meal."}
{"text":"We had a great time at La Vecchia. The food was excellent and our server was very attentive and informative. The atmosphere was lively and intimate - I love the chandeliers and the various photos and assorted memorabilia on the walls. My favourite dish would have to be the beef ravioli. The ravioli was perfectly cooked, there was just enough cheese (but not so much so that it was overwhelming) and it was an overall perfect dish. The tiramisu was probably the best tiramisu that I've ever had - it was light and airy yet sinfully good. La Vecchia is the place to go to if you're craving authentic Italian food. The charming and intimate atmosphere is perfect for dates. I look forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place was really busy on the Friday night we went as a couple. It's definitely on the loud side despite having a romantic look. The fresh pasta was incredible but the pizza wasn't nearly as good as other pizzas in the city. Would return for the pasta but not for the pizza. The penne a la vodka was incredible - I would reorder that in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Overall a solid Italian meal. Everything was great including the service. I would choose here over its neighbour Grazie any day."}
{"text":"This place was so nice. It was pretty and romantic inside. The staff were really nice and accommodating. I had a baby on a stroller and they helped me take the baby out and took my stroller downstairs. Our server played with my baby and was concerned about us the whole time. Food was good. Pastas were delicious however the pizza we got wasn't good. Best pasta is the tortelloni in a rose sauce. Would recommend this place to everione"}
{"text":"I had lunch on the patio, our server Megan was very polite and thanked us for sitting at the patio,  the weather was great.  I must say that next time I might want to sit inside the restaurant, the interior is beautifully done!  O.k. Onto the food, I had risotto, it was PERFECT!  This city is rocking with better and better food and I am so glad to have the opportunity to experience some of it at restaurants like this one. I will be back, all the dishes that I saw looked well prepared and yummy."}
{"text":"What to say...we read the reviews and they looked great so we decided try La Vecchia . After checking the menu and the reviews we thought the food and the prices would be pretty reasonable but we were wrong. 

Made a reservation, warm greeting from the waiter, ordered wine and bruschetta and it went down hill from there. After a long wait we reminded the waiter about the bruschetta , nothing. Another reminder to the waiter and it finally came. Chopped tomatoes and herbs on stale flat bread. Never had flatbread bruschetta before and I won't be having it again. We were hungry so we ate, but it was not great. $9. 

Lots of menu items looked good but the special sounded nice so we went for it. It was ok ( minus some fish bones) but not special. We were not aware the special was the most expensive item on offer that night. $33pp Another mistake.

One of us got a coffee and we asked for the bill. The waiter had trouble processing the bill and it took so long she asked for a top up on the coffee while we were waiting for the restaurant to fix the problem. Guess what...that top up was another $4 ...all in all we ended up paying over $200 for the three of us. 

We won't be back. There are so many places to choose from in the area with delicious food and excellent service. To bad Vecchia isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Had an incredible dinner at this restaurant. The cream of mushroom soup with spinach was amazing, and the rigatoni was incredible - the goat cheese was an amazing touch. Finally, the lemon cheesecake was fantastic.

I can't say enough good things about this meal. The atmosphere and service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"No.

Excited and optimistic about the positive reviews, I decided to venture to Vecchia with a guest.

When I asked the server if there is a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon available he decided to correct my pronunciation. Mind you, I know my wines and he repeated the type of wine exactly how I pronounced it to him. My date and I, also the table next to us laughed about it. We brushed it off and found it to be amusing yet distasteful. 

When the food came our experience rapidly declined. Bland, unseasoned, mediocre, poorly plated dishes. Our food was barely touched.

The only positive is that the decor is intimate and the bathrooms are spacious and clean. But when it comes to food I prefer satisfactory courses over ambiance. 

I won't return."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. We ordered all the veal options and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Great great great ambiance, wonderful service, and the food is delicious.  

The only issues I had were the maitre d' was wearing heavy cologne (which I would have thought was a restaurant 101 no-no) and the menu outside had much lowere prices than inside.  

But I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with family. Tried an egg dish and a few pastas.  The egg dish was not my favorite it was overcooked however the pastas were great. Everyone liked their dishes. The decoration and the atmosphere is tasteful and the service was very nice and friendly. This restaurant is my sister-in-law's favorite and she always recommends it as an option when going for a nice and reasonably priced meal. I also thought the prices were very reasonable. Considering that we live in the area i think we would be back but definitely trying the pastas next time. 

Food: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Service and atmosphere: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Food, service and ambiance were outstanding last night. Would highly recommend this place for dinner. Waiter's knowledge of wine was beyond expectations. Make sure you have a reservation as this place will be packed for dinner!"}
{"text":"Had an Amazing experience for my birthday. Loved the food and atmosphere of this place. We will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.
The food is very good and consistent.  I have had many of the dishes and find that they are always well executed and consistent.  The other major plus for this restaurant is that it has a great ambience for a date or even to just get together and catchup with a friend.... Cheers... LOL"}
{"text":"Not a bad Italian place. I've had better in the states. The service was very good and friendly. I went with my family and surrounding families (a group of about 10 people) and we got a lot of food. We started out with a bunch of appetizers. There were 3 plates of the grilled calamari which had a balsamic vinegar with olive oil dressing. This was actually one of my more favorite dishes. We also got the orders of the mussels which I did not like because of the sauce. There was also a plate of grilled calamari, octopus and shrimp which wouldn't be bad if it wasn't cold.

For the main course, I got the fish of the day which was pretty good. My sister got the Grigliata di pesce which was a grilled red snapper that came with calamari, shrimp and salmon. I tried the red snapper was ok but not as good as my fish of the day. My brother got the Pizza Piemonte which came with spicy italian pancetta. This had the potential to be really good if the pancetta was actually spicy and if they did not completely load up on the cheese. My aunt got a risotto la vecchia. The jumbo tiger shrimps looked fantastic as did the risotto. However, there was just way too much butter in the rice to make it enjoyable. My mom got the Linguini Frutti di mare which I thought was probably the best dish and wished that I had gotten it instead of my fish of the day. If I ever go back here, I will be getting this dish because from all the ones that I tried, this was the best.

Oh. And plan on dropping some serious dough here."}
{"text":"Finally after so long of hearing great things about this place had the opportunity to try it!   Came here for brunch last week and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

My friend and I ordered to share: carpaccio, 4 cheese pizza, beef brisket ravioli and of course tiramisu for dessert.

The pizza was freshly made and light and delicious.  The lunch portion is definitely big enough for 2 people (2 slices each)

The beef brisket ravioli in a mushroom/truffle sauce was lovely (I wish it were a bit more creamy but that's my personal preference).  The beef was tender and the pasta dough was perfect.

The service was friendly and the decor is so lovely- old world charm on Yonge/Eglinton!

Definitely do yourself a favor and come here for a meal!  They do get quite busy in the evenings so make reservations."}
{"text":"I discovered La Vecchia over a year ago when my friend and I were walking in the Yonge and Eg area, looking for a yummy dinner spot.

After my first visit, I find myself going back to this restaurant on a consistent basis because I absolutely LOVE their dinner menu.

The food is really delicious and they have a large selection of Italian goodies, such as pastas, pizzas and meat dishes.

To start, I always get a creamy caesar salad, which is always fresh and crunchy with homebaked croutons or I will get the bruschetta with sweet tomatoes and herbs if I am absolutely starving.

For my main course, I am a HUGE sucker for their pastas. I drool as I think about their four cheese gnocchi, their portabello mushroom penne, their rigatoni romani or their simple spagetti - which is so satisfying.

In terms of other meal options, their pizzas are huge and are not skimpy when it comes to their toppings.

FOR VEGGIES -- try the vegetarian pizza! It looked like a rainbow because it was packed with red, green, orange and yellow peppers, spinach and onions. 

The appetizers range anywhere from $6 to $12 and the main courses range from $14 to $30 (prices go up when you order the red meat options).

The restaurant's atmosphere is romantic and cozy, which makes it a great date spot - even if you are just going for a drink. 

In the summer, La Vecchia opens up their patio so you can experience the sunshine, warm weather and the busy streets of Yonge and Eg as you eat.

Overall, this is a great midtown Italian delight!"}
{"text":"I had a very lousy and miserable experience this past week when I attempted to have dinner here. I sent the restaurant an email with a complete description and they didn't bother to acknowledge my email.

Yet, I am not surprised given how rude the male hostess treated me and how much of a peanut gallery the servers behaved like.  I have never been treated so rudely and been insulted by the hostess before. I am never returning to this place and will continue supporting one of the many other Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood.

How appropriate that they are named Old. They treat single patrons with disdain and younger patrons with such rudeness, like an old man looking with contempt to the new generation.

I am never again coming to La Vecchia."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Italian restaurants that I have been to. I've come here twice, once with family from the UK, and another time with friends, and each time service was generally very quick.

The atmosphere is clean, but is very dark/low light. It's intimate also, a little too intimate...each time that I have been here, it was crazy busy and hard to move around, mostly because tables around you are very close together, making it difficult to move around/through the restaurant.

BUT: the food is phenomenal. On my first check-in with family, they loved it, and definitely thought it was one of the better Italian restaurants that they have been to around the world. 

The ravioli (spinach and cheese) is very good. Small portions, unfortunately - 4/5.
The gnocchi comes in a big  portion size and has a lot of flavour to it to keep it interesting, but is a little costly by comparison -5/5
Ferrero rocher gelato is unique to this restaurant. With just the right amount of sweetness and richness, it will compliment your dinner very nicely. 5/5."}
{"text":"Part of the still-open-on-(some)-statutory-holidays Yonge and Eglinton strip, I've been to this place a few times.

Upon arriving, you don't get that outsider feeling, like in some restaurants where the waiters are hiding from you until the host/ess shows - at La Vecchia, they'll greet you with a welcome (and seat you if need be). My experience is that the waiters have tried much on the menu and can offer good recommendations.

The ambiance is one of a friendly gathering place for close friends to share a girls' night meal or a double date.  They dim their lights at about 7:30 giving the place a more intimate feel, but the crowd doesn't get any more canoodly as a result.

Having had a selection of starters and mains, I'm of the opinion that both the appetizers and pastas are freshly prepared and well-assembled.  The ravioli in particular stands out, with perfectly cooked fresh pasta and savory (and not overly greasy - hooray!) mushroom sauce.

Sadly, not all of their desserts are made in-house.  As for the ones that are, they are fairly well-prepared, though not the chef's specialty.  The creme brulée was passable, but not spectacular, and the warm chocolate cake is rich, but somewhat overdone.

On the whole, I would recommend this place for dinner - but not drinks or dessert.  When the patio is open, patio lunch is also well done and recommended."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at La Vecchia after a coworker gave it rave reviews. My boyfriend and I arrived about 10 minutes early for our 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night and we were seated right away. Our waiter was at our table within a few minutes of being seated. 

I had a glass of pinot grigio (the $10 one) and my boyfriend had a beer. The wine was a little crisp, not too sweet, and COLD - the way I like white wine! 

We started with the bruschetta. Diced tomato, basil, olive oil and shaved Parmesan on a flat bread. I liked the bread to tomato ratio with this bruschetta. Some restaurants make it with bread that's too thick, which takes away from the tomatoes, which should be the star of the dish! 

I chose the tortellone for my main dish. The fresh shells were stuffed with ricotta and spinach in a cherry tomato light cream sauce. You could taste how fresh the pasta was. And there was just the right amount of filling. I really enjoyed the sauce (I used bread to soak up every last drop!) it was creamy but still light.  I have to admit, when the dish arrived with only 5 tortellone, I thought it wouldn't be enough, but I was full by the end. The only \"complaint\" I have (although I wouldn't even call it that) is that some portions of the pasta shell were slightly hard while other sections were really soft. 

My boyfriend had the chicken breast with roasted potatoes and grilled vegetables in a mushroom sauce, which he really enjoyed. 

Our server was very friendly and the service was pretty quick, especially considering it was a Saturday night. I would definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My absolute fav place to go to!!! Make my mouth water just thinking of going there.

Most Romantic place to go with that special Person....

I LOVE U LA VECCHIA !!"}
{"text":"While the food is great, I do not think the prices are justified. Especially when you have Grazie right around the corner."}
{"text":"I think there will be a renaissance of classic cuisines like French and especially Italian in 2017. Back to the basics of pasta and pizza but with new twists for the health conscious of course. After the somewhat glowing reviews, I admit perhaps I was expecting to be blown away a bit but I left this place a little underwhelmed.
The staff was warm and inviting like the space. This is more of a classic looking space where the dim lights really do an admirable job of hiding some of the outdated-ness. This is a narrow space so bumping elbows and rubbing butts is quite frequent.
You will find all the solid Italian classics here, really with no room for creativity or anything out of the ordinary. Whole wheat pasta/pizza is really as exciting as it gets here so if you are a modernist, I would probably forgo this place right about now. We had the classic calamari preparation in a light butter broth. The calamari cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of chew all the while still very tender. The sauce was light and not overpowering but perhaps a little too light. Second dish was a homemade pizza. I went with the vegetarian style with an assortment of veggies and yes, there is cheese. The dough tasted fresh and was a little more substantial than I wanted. It's on par with your typical homemade dough but nothing outstanding really. The toppings were a little disappointing even though they went a little heavy handed with it. They were bland and tasted like it was pre-made a few hours ago (that crispiness is gone and the oil flavour has started to intensify). Overall, an average pizza that wasn't quite memorable. Lastly but not least we arrive at the ravioli and of course we went against the grain and got it whole wheat. I cannot comment on how much better the regular one would be but the whole wheat was a little thick (as in the dough) for my liking. The filling was uninspiring and the sauce (or there lack off) had a difficult time clinging on the the pasta. There wasn't much flavour profile to describe as it tasted like any ordinary pasta sauce.

I don't think many will agree with my review given the 4 stars overall for this place. But I do think this is appropriate considering the amount of quality eats around this area. I do appreciate the home-iness and freshness of all the ingredients used but I just wish there was a little more flavour and finesse in the execution. Overall a decent restaurant but far from leaving a lasting impression."}
{"text":"A very romantic decor in the restaurant - perfect for dates :) !
Ordered the Carpaccio La Vecchia which had marinated beef tenderloin & argula. The strong flavour of the tenderloin went well with the bitterness of the argula.
For the main, we ordered the house special lamb rack and linguini fruitti di mare which consisted of mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and calamari in a white wine tomato sauce. The seafood was very fresh, especially the scallops.
 We paired the mains with a bottle of Chianti, recommended by the waiter.

The service was excellent. Our waiter recommended the homemade tiramisu and surely it was an amazing finish to our meal."}
{"text":"I wandered in here on a Wednesday evening to try the risotto that came highly recommended by a friend. The place was packed with a few people waiting. As I was dining solo, they were able to accommodate me at the bar. 

The bartenders were really friendly and chatty and I struck up a conversation with the guy sitting beside me at the bar. It's always nice to meet new people who are not constantly engrossed with their phone. 

I enjoyed the Calamari Sofia followed by the mushroom risotto. Was it ever good! Wow. I also had some really nice wine with my dinner. At the end of the meal, I received a complimentary glass (just a half-glass, really) of strawberry grappa. So delicious! They have an amazing selection of grappa - normally, it has a very strong taste (like pure alcohol) but the strawberry one was really nice.  

Love this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Patio season is in full swing and this little sidewalk patio is ideal for people watching in  one of my favourite areas in the GTA. We enjoyed the shrimps wrapped in prosciutto and mussels in tomato broth which was rich and robust. A bottle of Chardonnay went well with this light but satisfying dish. After lingering a bit we went for a slice of cheese cake which finished the meal off perfectly. 

Afterwards we walked along Yonge Street. There are a number of interesting shops to browse through for vinyl records, books and boutiques. A terrific night!"}
{"text":"I came here after searching what's best place for Italian food in town. It's really stand out and seem it's not only the food but experience I have in here are amazing. I and bf came here around 2pm for late lunch. Not much people but I bet this place will be crowded in the weekend.
Cons: they have so many good options and the menu took me good 10 mins just try to decide what I want. I will recommend everyone to come here!"}
{"text":"Great food overall only problem we had was that the raviolis werent cooked completely...  everything else was perfect, best tiramisu I've tried."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had one of the best tender and most delicious tender loin beefs of my life! amazing! the staff and service was superflouous!"}
{"text":"My fiancee, kids and family were at the restaurant earlier today for a \"farewell\" brunch for my parents, who are leaving for Florida for a month. The restaurant was very busy (seems to be a popular restaurant in this area) and as such, it took a while for all of us to get our meals, but it was well worth the wait. The food was delicious, the staff were very professional, and they brought us dessert, on the house, to apologize for the wait time. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends. Absolutely. Please note that La Vecchia Ristorante will accommodate gluten free diet requirements.  On a personal note to the staff at Lavecchia Ristorante, we sincerely apologize to the serving staff and management for the behavior of certain members of our party."}
{"text":"I have to endorse other reviewers' dire assessments.  Our desperately gregarious waiter heavily oversold the authenticity of the cuisine, but I saw nothing on the menu that differed from any other generic Italian restaurant in the city (e.g., Il Fornello).  The food amounted to expensive, overcooked meat and mushy pasta drowning in very heavy sauces.  The clueless servers didn't seem to know how to handle a crowded table and it was all kind of an unprofessional mess.

One of the members of my party left an admittedly stingy tip, and to her stunned chagrin one of the staff confronted her about it and essentially shamed her into leaving more money, which showed a total lack of class.  I won't defend cheaping out on the tip, but it struck me as really, really tacky behaviour on the part of a restaurant that holds itself out as a fine dining establishment, and a shocking 180° reversal from the over-the-top insincere hospitality with which we were presented.

I haven't left a restaurant this dissatisfied nor, frankly, felt so ripped off in a long time."}
{"text":"Make sure you max out your parking.  Service tends to be inconsistent.  One day you get your appetizer and first course and bill in less than an hour,  next day 2+ hours.  So make sure you prepay the meter at least twice what you think you will need.

We had a business dinner here a couple of weeks ago.  I had bought two hours of street parking because I expected to be done in 90 minutes as usual. The food was original and good.  They apologized for the delays and gave us complimentary amaro after our appetizer and complimentary coffee at the end.  But it took 2.5 hours for this simple meal and I ended up with a $30 parking ticket.  Emailed La Vecchia and they responded \"We are serving hundreds of customer per day we have no control who has proper parking tickets or not. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about this.\"   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good. Fresh Ingredients Very Quick Service.

Had the rack of Lamb special.

Only Complaints would be: We asked the server if they had a salad with no lettuce, and they brought us a salad with all lettuce and a little bit of goat cheese."}
{"text":"A year ago, I wrote a 4-star review about how much I love this place, which I've been coming to for 6 years. It used to be a very romantic spot where the waiters made you laugh and the managers went above and beyond to make your night special. The attitude in there has completely changed. Unfortunately, the manager and chef both appear to have just completely stopped caring. The manager and the staff used to be so sweet and helpful and now they act like their customers are an inconvenience on them. We started off with stale, floury  table bread - not what they usually have.  I ordered my  favourite dish last night - the agnolotti di monte. It's fresh, delicious and just melts in your mouth - usually. My boyfriend tried his first piece and announced, \"It's not cooked.\" I ate some and noted the sides of the agnolotti were as stiff as cardboard. The sauce tasted more acidic and less creamy than usual and the ricotta inside just tasted old - kind like when something has been in the fridge. I couldn't eat it from the texture alone. When I told the waiter the manager came over and instead of apologizing for the mistake, he made it sound like I was the one at fault. \"Oh, well, I can cook it more if YOU want,\" It was uncooked!  You better do better in a pricey Italian restuarant! I told him I'd been coming here for 6 years and this was my favourite dish. He didn't seem to care. It's $18. I don't think that's cheap for about 10 little pieces of pasta without ANY meat.  Our other dish, the pasta  special, was great, and I said that. So what does he say? He accuses me (while laughing) of sending back my undercooked, sub-par pasta (which he has not tasted) because I just decided I liked the other dish better. I've never been so offended by a restaurant owner/manager. This is the second time in 2 months I've gone here and had snobby unapologetic service and at least one dish of poorly cooked food (last time was a frittata). But it's the service that gets me. Our waiter treated us terribly after we returned our food. He didn't even wish us a good night or anything after our meal. I'm sorry to say that I have to take a 5 star review and turn it into a 2 star and announce I won't be going back here. I'm not sure what's happened to this place, but it's not worth your time the way it used to be."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice(ish) restaurant to take some people to for brunch and La Vecchia seemed to fit the bill. I easily made a reservation online for the next day, although when we showed up, I was left waiting for a few minutes before anyone approached us. (This was especially annoying given that there was a surly-looking waitress literally standing off to the side.)

Anyway, the ambiance in the restaurant is pretty nice. And the list of cocktails looked promising, so I went with their take on a Caesar. While it looked the part, it tasted off somehow; the drink seemed strangely watered down, and, worse still, it had this underlying sweetness that was incredibly off-putting.

For my meal, I ordered the Eggs Diavola (2 eggs sunny side up with capicollo melted mozzarella cheese spicy tomato sauce served with home fries). This was a decent yet completely unmemorable dish. The almost room-temperature home fries were bland, and the eggs were overcooked. (One yolk was completely firm while the other only oozed a little bit.) The tomato sauce was fine, although the lack of spice was disappointing. (If I'm ordering something called \"diavola\" I want to be donkey-kicked in the face with heat.)

I'd probably return to La Vecchia if only for the ambiance. But maybe the pasta and pizza is better?"}
{"text":"We went there for an anniversary, I am still surprised  that restaurant got 4 stars.

 We had a reservation at 8pm but got the chance to seat at 8.30. Our waiter was trying to be friendly but you could feel that it was all fake, specially after we decided not to order any dessert his attitude was so rude. 

The quality of food was terrible but pricey. I got RIGATONI ROMANi, ... so instead of peaces of chicken there was shredded chicken in my pasta, ( everybody knows that shredded chicken could be from any part of stock chicken :((  ), and my friend who ordered LINGUINI CALAMARATI, just got a plate of really bad quality frozen seafood with pasta. It was absolutely bad and tasteless.

I would give it two stars just for the decoration nothing more"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant was very well laid out. The guests who were with me were impressed. The calamari appetizers were terrific as was the rigatoni. 

The Kronbaucher beer was very good. Excellent service. I would recommend the restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Fish lunch special tasted funny and over priced for the portion. Ended up spending more time paying bills than actually eating."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend and was recommended the ravioli de niro (described on the menu as jumbo meat ravioli in butter wild mushroom truffle essence sauce..mmm). I don't normally order ravioli because my appetite calls for more than a few pockets of stuffed pasta. On this occasion, I went for it because it came highly recommended, especially the filling factor. Let's say I was satisfied both for portion size and for taste. The meat inside the ravioli like my friend described is not your regular ground, homogenized type of texture, but instead are shreds of  braised and super tender meat. There are heaps of wild mushrooms and the sauce is concentrated and full of flavour. Now back track to the appetizer which we share-calamari alla griglia-grilled calamari with balsamic vinegar with roasted red peppers. The calamari was cooked perfectly, fresh, tender and smokey from the grill. Needless to say, we finished everything and had two baskets of their delicious bread! 

The only thing is they don't take debit, so make sure you come with cash or other cards!"}
{"text":"**2.5 stars

Alright, I'm going to be totally honest and say it was the service and atmosphere that really made the experience...

Dined here for the first time for a friend's birthday along with 10 other people on a Tuesday night.  I was surprised to see the restaurant was packed from 7pm right up until closing time.  This place is very cozy (in a good way) and great ambiance with the table top candles and dim lighting.  I would say a smart casual outfit would do here, by night.

I do love Italian food.  But because it is quite mainstream in Toronto, I have been blessed with the privilege to have had dined in quite many other Italian restaurants (good thing) to provide a fair opinion.  Thus, I am a little picky (not so good thing).  Staying true to the culture, the menu is categorized to separate the antipasti, pasta, risotto, secondi, and pizza... all consisting a wide selection.  Of course, I took forever to decide...

Calamari Sofia: $12.50 (2/5 stars)
Meh... standard pricing for the portion.  Don't let the description of being served with grilled oyster mushrooms fool you.  There were barely any.  If you didn't know it was supposed to be there, you would miss it all together... especially in the dim lighting.  Although perfectly cooked, it was served slightly on the warm side.  Very... bland and uninspiring.  Perhaps the grilled cali would've been much better.

Carpaccio La Vecchia: $12.50 (3/5 stars)
I've only had a sample.  But it's your standard carpaccio with a touch of lemon, s&p, and truffle.  Can't really go wrong. 

Zuppa del Giorno: $7.50 (4/5 stars)
It was cream of Spinach that night, and what do you know?  This was the star of the night for me (aside from the vino, of course)!  Very basic pureed spinach seasoned perfectly!

Linguini Calamarati: $17.50 (3/5 stars)
Judging only by taste, I would probably give this a 2, but it's only $17.50!! Where else will you find a good portion of fresh pasta with all the seafood for this price?! Half a dozen of shrimp, 8 mussels, calamari all tossed in a garlic olive oil with a white kidney beans.  But honestly, little too many beans and really- quite BLAND in taste.

Pasta del Giorno: $?? (3/5 stars)
That night featured a potato gnocchi with chicken tossed in a pesto cream sauce.  Very good portion and I must say the flavour was much more bold than anything else I've had that night.  However, the shredded chicken was very limited.

Service: 5/5 stars
You can hire servers, but you can't hire personality! I believe his name is Alex.  Our party was late for our reso, but he was patient the whole time.  Very knowledgeable of the food menu as well as the wine.  The food all arrived at the same time with the perfect timing in between courses.  Quality checks right on time, and wine pouring and water refills were done throughout the night silently.  The server assistant was great too!  We were greeted goodbyes with just as much enthusiasm as we were first approached.  Alex is definitely an asset!

I've learned that this place has been around for 18 years, and the exec chef and sous have not changed.  Neither have the recipes.  I guess this explains the traditional dishes and flavours.  Unfortunately, this is not a restaurant i would necessarily revisit.  I would have to say it's not the best restaurant if you want something inspiring, unique, and bold flavoured, there are many other places for that.  But If you're not too picky like I am, and seek a nice restaurant with very homely flavours at a fair price, this is the place!  Remember to make resos!"}
{"text":"Overall good Italian food, a little noisy for my liking but decor/ambience is nice. The only disappointment was the dessert, we asked for the caramel crunch only to be told that they had run out for the night."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a work trip and I was surprised by how tasty everything was. Had a mushroom stuffed pasta as well as a tiramisu... delicious"}
{"text":"Mediocre brunch- very plain Benedict on a soggy English muffin. 4 homefries and 2 fruits. The hollandaise almost had a sourness to it. Won't return."}
{"text":"I was taken here today for a birthday lunch with my boss and co-worker.  They have a nice selection of lunch specials, plus a full lunch menu.  I had the seafood risotto, which is served in a tomato sauce and has a decent amount of shrimp and scallops.  It was creamy and delicious.  I also had tiramisu for dessert, which was soooo flavourful, light and fluffy, and a very generous sized serving.
 
I can see how this would make a great date spot, but it also makes a good business lunch.  The service was good - we were offered fresh parmesan and fresh ground pepper, our water glasses were never empty, dishes were cleared promptly, and our server was friendly and even a little funny.  The establishment is elegant looking, without being the least bit pretentious.  Lunch prices are more than reasonable ($12 for the risotto I believe)."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food and ambiance 
Service truly feels like you are in Italy 
And I truly and utterly have to recommend the tiramisu is the best your taste buds will ever have.. Trust me . Love coming here"}
{"text":"Cesar salad had almost no dressing, too much cheese....Seafood Risotto was small shrimp, a couple of mussels, and calamari. I am tired of going to restaurants who have seafood on the menu and land up serving frozen seafood that costs next to nothing.  The Risotto was also very salty, others at the table did not love their dishes...oh well, lots of other great Italian in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Love the decor, the service and the food! Been here many times and it never disappoints. Always consistently good Italian food."}
{"text":"One of our favourite Italian restaurants in the city. Good food for decent prices. The place is a little crammed but it works."}
{"text":"I honestly don't go to many fancy Italian restaurants because most of the Italian places out there make me feel like I can whip up a basic pasta dish at home that would be comparable or better.

Went here for a work outing, and found the ambience to be nice, calming and the building aged, rustic and fitting to what I would imagine an Italian restaurant should look like.  I went here for a work outing and thought that it was a nice fancy twist to the typical mediocre restaurant that work place outings are notorious for.

We didn't order any alcoholic drinks but we did order appetizers.  Although the waiter messed up and did not bring our appetizers out until our food came out, he apologized and at the end of the meal gave us a round of mango shots.  These shots were amazing, and tasted like a mix of mango lassi, lime and vodka.  Not sure if that was authentic Italian or not but it was the best shot I've ever tasted.  Truly inspiring.

The dining experience is not always perfect, but this was a stellar example of how a really good server can turn around a somewhat negative experience into a very postive one.  It almost made me forget that the kitchen mixed up one of my co-worker's dishes.

The food was very nice as well.  Not too over-the-top, nice, simple and tasty.  With that being said, I would recommend this place for a date or intimate dinner.  It's just a place that you can fully enjoy during a 1 hour lunch window."}
{"text":"This place is always packed when passing by so I really wanted to try it to see for myself. Booked a table and went there. The place was not as packed, although they had quite a few dinner guests. The first thing I came to think of was how dark and loud this place was. And I mean very loud. We were seated in a corner at the back of the restaurant. As the waiter presented the specials I could not quite hear what he was saying as the music was so loud. It was so loud that throughout dinner it was hard to hear what the person across the table was saying.
We ordered Scaloppine Diano Marina (veal in creamy mushroom sauce with roasted potatoes) and Capellini Sardi (pasta with shrimp and scallops).
My veal steak was good, tender and had a lot of flavour and the mushroom sauce tasted delicious! My husband enjoyed the pasta. I also tried it but think the veal dish had a lot more flavour. The portion size was so big that there simply wasn't any room for dessert. Although people around us seemed to enjoy gelato and the cheesecake a lot. 
Now for the rating. If I base this review solely on food it would get a 4 star. However, considering how loud it was it only gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at La Vecchia. Our server was polite and knowledgeable, the food was brought out on time, and everything was perfect. 
I had ossa bucca and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why anyone wouldn't  give this place a 5 star rating! For starters, all the staff was extremely polite and helpful (they were also very accommodating in helping me pull off a surprise I planned for my best friend's birthday) and they really do go above and beyond in being of good service to you. The food is absolutely amazing, both my friend and I had la vecchia pizza which I highly recommend, it has a very good quality and European taste to it (and I am from Europe so believe me when I say this.) For dessert we both had the cheesecake which is made with crema dulce and it was also amazing. Finally, the place is very clean and nicely decorated so I will definitely be coming back. I was so pleased with my experience that I felt this place truly deserved for me to post an amazing review!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. Food is amazing most of the time. zuppa de pesce and pizza are usually two things i like the most at the place. Service on the other hand is a hit or miss, the older guys know what they doing a new guys are too slow. Very busy place during the weekends."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto for probably the past 4 years.  
I'm not sure what I enjoy more, the food or the service and ambiance.  I've enjoyed every dish I've had there; some of my favourites being the Ravioli De Niro, the Agnolloti Di Monte, and occasionally they have a special delicious dessert, Profiteroles!

The service and ambiance is what brings me back their monthly.  This is the type of place where you get lost in your company, and before you know it you've been there for 3 hours yet you still don't want to leave. The owners Fillipo, Massimo and Ciro always have their eye on what's going on to make sure everything is perfect.  
The servers Alex, Nico and Pavol to name a few, are what servers should be. Friendly, knowledgable and very accommodating. I'll never forgot on my second visit there, Alex ran out of the restaurant after my family and I (us looking in our pockets assuming we'd left something behind), solely for him to tell us it was a pleasure serving us and he hopes to see us back there.  Needless to say we were all shocked, but with huge smiles on our faces.  

This place is a triple threat, food, service and ambiance.  If you love Italian food, and are looking to go on a date, a family dinner, or take out some guests or friends..this is your place!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.

I came here with Lauren and I have to agree with her. I'd be more forgiving if this place was considered \"fast food\", but the prices imply something far more gourmet. Unfortunately the experience fails to deliver. My pizza was mostly hard crust with a stingy handful of toppings and overall it was greasy and overdone.

I arrived here with a huge appetite, so the fact the food tasted so mediocre suggests I wouldn't want to chance this menu on a narmal day.  Service was friendly and the decor was nice, but I'm puzzled as to how the average rating seems higher than my experience suggests."}
{"text":"We ordered take out on a week day later in the night. The lady on the other side of the phone informed us that it will take 20 minutes to prepare, a pretty average wait time for take out. We arrived about 20 minutes after and the food was ready. 

We ordered grilled calamari and diavola pizza. It also came with a few slices of bread that was nothing special. The grilled calarmi came in 1 whole piece. I can see it being easier to eat with forks and knife. It was definitely a healthier approach to many fried and non fried calamari I have had. It is lightly seasoned with some red pepper. I liked how it wasn't salty and I could just snack on it. The pizza was delicious as well. The crust was thin and crispy with a good amount of cheese, toppings, and tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Quite tasty Italian conveniently located just North of Y&E, with a small patio and nice cool stone interior for hot days.

FOOD:

Excellent fritata selection, from vegetarian friendly to all - out meat and cheese fest-- prociutto with asagio and ricotta, etc. I chose the Estiva, which was succulent with portabello and crisply cheesy on the edges, perfectly savory.

The french toast looked amazingly crunchy, and was served in Jenga-ish layers, adorned with berries. I admired, and was told it was heavenly.

These portion sizes were hangover-friendly.

SERVICE:

Service was merely decent. Coffee service was poor. The server was very rude when I enquired about the French toast, and confused challa with calabrese bread. Jeesh, I'm not James Beard on bread!"}
{"text":"This is such a good date spot. It so romantic from the food to the decor to the service. Our server was phenomenal. He made us feel so welcome and chatted with us about the industry even though he was slammed. He finished our meal with a bit of limoncello which was delicious! The food was really flavourful. We get wary of going to Italian restaurants due to many preparing dishes the same way but La Vecchia's pasta is amazing. Definitely recommend making a reservation because it was packed with a huge line up. Thank you for the evening guys!"}
{"text":"I was starving and needed a quick dinner and feeling like pizza, so I decided to see what all of the buzz was about. 

VIBE 
It's really dark in here! It's very fancy pants looking and can look very intimidating to a solo diner. Luckily, the staff here were wonderful. We were all engaged in conversation from the cook to the owner! 

I ATE
I had the signature La Vecchia pizza. Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mixed Mushroom (just regular ones ..no portabello) it hit the spot. The bread is a bit stale on the end. I'm partial to Pizzeria Libretto to be honest.

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
$25 (including a generous tip) for a pizza and a pop is A LOT to spend on a solo dinner (for me).  I'd come back again though and see how other items compare as this was my first visit."}
{"text":"Stuff started off a bit sour. They gave our table away because we were late (20 minutes), which is understandable because they were busy. We had to wait quite some time before they found another table, probably waiting out another person's reservation or something.

Waiting at the bar, I decided to get a drink. The Disaronno Sour on the menu sounded good: fresh lime and bitters. When I saw her make it, there was no bitters used, and she used bar mix. I brought this to her attention and she said they ran out of fresh lemon and lime and had to use bar mix. Ummm... Why didn't you tell me this when I was ordering? If you're going to say your Amaretto Sour is super awesome on the menu, please let me know that you can no longer make it that way and that you're going to charge me restaurant prices for a dive bar amaretto sour. I hate when people do that. Are they hoping you don't notice?! I'm gonna know that you're using bar mix instead of actual fruit.

The food is average, about a 3-star food itself. Not the best but not the worst. The appetizers we ordered were quite dull. The beef carpaccio seemed like it was sitting on the plate in the refrigerator for a long time. It completely fell apart when I unstuck it from the plate and had no flavour at all. Topped with a generous amount of arugula and cheap parmesan cheese (not the good stuff). I was quite disappointed. The fish of the day, Chilean sea bass, was quite nice. It also came with a salad of arugula, fig and walnuts, which was a surprisingly good combination. The rigatoni romani was delicious. The entrees were the highlight. They do this well. Espresso was good.

Service started off slow but they brought everything pretty quickly. I had to constantly ask for a water refill. The server didn't seem to know much about wine and was hesitant to talk much. I had to keep asking questions to find out more info. Fortunately they have a great wine menu. I was happy with what I ordered.

Food came quickly. I prefer when they stagger it and give you time between your courses but they brought everything right away, yet were  slow to take the initial order and bring drinks. I prefer the other way around, like most restaurants do.

The atmosphere is quite nice with the pot lights on dimmers and exposed stone work.

Decent Italian place that's good for a date if you arrive on time for your reservation and are on a budget. Based on my experience I'd be hesitant to go back, and with so many new places to try in the city and old favourites to revisit, I doubt I'd find myself here again."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is good - they are super busy and reservations are highly recommended.  The dessert we had (caramel crunch) was delicious!  We had pastas and pizzas and everything was quite tasty - would come back again but definitely not as walk ins."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I often pass by this area. Everything was \"okay.\" The pizza and the pasta was good, but not amazing. Their service was okay. Later on Friday night, it became quite noisy, so my friend and I decided to quickly finish our meal and move to another place. Everything just seemed okay, but there was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"La Vecchia is a couple blocks north of Eglinton on yonge street. 

I was here for a business meeting so we were in the basement in a private room. 

We had antipasto, I had the risotto and the beef with mash. 

The most offputting thing for me was the waitress who just wasnt very good. She couldnt really provide much input on the food and seemed to have attitude at the same time. 

The antipasto is typical Italian stuff. The Risotto was pretty tight and delicious.  The beef just wasnt a very typically italian meal.It was kind of a let down and the texture of the meat just wasnt great. 

I probably wouldnt come back. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Or of my favourites! Love the ambiance. Food is great and service is prompt and friendly. Can be a bit pricey for the daily specials, so stick with the regular menu if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"The appetizer is amazing! As same as pasta; the server is charming and kind, definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"3 star for Brunch and 4 for Lunch and Dinner. French Toast - Great, Florentine- Average (avg Hollandaise sauce). Staff is professional and is able to work quite a few tables. Nice decor, give it a try in the evenings to make it your money's worth."}
{"text":"A lively  place...filled with locals and seemed family friendly.  We ordered some specials like ravioli and veal chop.  Both good as was the veal with lemon.  But my risotto, was not risotto.  The risotto mare had a delicious sauce but the rice was not aborio rice and was close to crunchy."}
{"text":"2.5 star. Let's be honest, this place is really quite crap. 

I feel bad saying it because our server was incredible (GREAT service) and the interior is okay - decent decor.

But the food, ugh. The pizzas we had were so uninspired and bland, they tasted like something I bought in the freezer section of Rabba. I ordered a quattro staggioni - which is supposed to have a different ingredient in each quarter of the pizza (representing different seasons) but instead it was just four ingredients placed all over the entire thing. Sigh. And the crust was thick and hard like cardboard.

Maybe their non-pizza items are better, but ugh!"}
{"text":"There was a cockroach on the wall beside our table, called the waitress she was sorry sent the manager over he was kinda dry just said sorry kinda oh well like! Then he got a towel to get it off the wall and didn't really look after we saw the dead cockroach was still on the table, the waitress came and wiped it off... so they gave us complimentary lemonciello shots! Yeah never going back!"}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. As for food, some dishes were great, some were just okay.

The Buffalo capresse and tiramisu were great! The La Vecchia pizza and the Penne special was just okay."}
{"text":"Food: 
Pizza - La Vecchia: 2.5 stars
Costata di Vitello: 5 stars
Risotto Aragosta: 4 stars

The pizza was actually a bit of a disappointment because the crust and the bottom was quite burnt...like black burnt. Let's just say I have had better pizza for less, but then again, this is probably not the joint to go to for pizza anyway. On to the good stuff!
My boyfriend ordered the Costata di Vitello, which is 'Grilled 12 oz veal chop marinated with herbs and spices served with mashed potatoes and vegetables' (copied from their menu online). The veal chop was SUPER tender and juicy...probably one of the better steaks I have ever had. I would recommend this dish if you're feeling carnivorous. My risotto aragosta (Lobster and shrimp in a light spicy tomato sauce) was also very savoury. You have half a lobster buried with risotto. The mildly spicy tomato sauce gives it a little flair, which I appreciated. It can be quite a messy dish since you have to work your way to the meat in some parts of the lobster but overall, totally worth it.

Ambiance: 3 stars
I did come here on the Mother's day evening so I understand that it's busy but it was just too cramped in there...and a little too dim. I know it's part of setting the mood but it was dim enough that I honestly couldn't remember much about what the restaurant was like and it made me quite sleepy. They even placed a table right by a set of stairs going downstairs and every time someone walked past, you could feel your chair sinking in. It was really annoying so we asked for another table. That table really shouldn't be there since you're kind of in everyone's way. Sort of an unprofessional gesture on the restaurant's part, but we moved and the food was pretty amazing.

Service: 4 stars
Our waiter was wonderful and well-humoured. He did forget that we wanted our pizza to be whole wheat but honestly, not a big issue. We had pretty much everything we needed and he was probably overworked from it being Mother's day."}
{"text":"We came here in a large group and didn't do the typical wine and dine style and most servers would hate us. We made a reservation, but had one additional person than what the reservation was for, having already drank a lot before we came to eat, we did not order drinks, only one person ordered an appetizer, and no one ordered a dessert. 

Despite the low bill (about only one dish a person), which indicated a not so great tip given its clientele, the server was nice and friendly regardless, and was quite accommodating. I do appreciate that.

The food was great as well. I had a taste of my friend's mushroom salad, which, though simple, was delicious - which i believe is one of the great tenets of italian cuisine: simple but fresh ingredients. My seafood risotto was delicious as well, not short of seafood.

Overall it was a wonderful dining experience and I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Italian brunch. What could go wrong? Got 'divola'. unreal. Savory breakfast egg dish. Even if you're kinda grossed out by eggs (some people are) you'll like this (unless you're fucked). It's fresh, tasty, deliciously crunchy, zesty and a little spicy. Eggs and hearty potatoes in a fucking brilliant and complex tomato sauuuce. 

Got a sweet breakfast item too. Crêpes. It's hard to fuck up a crepe. Inherently tasty. Not especially stunning or fresh. Meh. That Uova dish more than makes up for it doe. Crepe done with chocolait and strawberries."}
{"text":"Had brunch there two times. Servers are very kind but food was just average. I feel like it's little pricy."}
{"text":"Cool, nice place food is good, and so are the drinks. A good place group gathering or friends hang out.  People are nice here."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and decided to go there with my family for a celebration. Boy, was it packed on a tuesday night! We had to wait 30 mins, and it is tough to wait inside given the space available, so we had to wait in the cold. The space was very cramped for us to sit on as well. So why have I given it such high ratings?

The service was excellent. They kept coming to apologize about the space available and the wait, and it seemed like everyone was really doing their best to make us have a good time. Our server (I think her name was Shannon) was FANTASTIC. Despite the place being extremely busy, there was never a moment without fresh bread on the table. Our server was extremely cheerful and added to our high spirits. She also got us free shots (which were great BTW) before we left.

Now the food - seriously amongst the best Italian food we have eaten. The spaghetti was delicious as was the rigatoni. Very favourful and an interesting mix of flavours. Very unique in taste as well. We loved the pesto chicken pizza as well. Again, bursting with flavour. The portions were generous, and none of us could finish our dishes, even though we hadn't eaten any starters. My brother decided to try the special (beef cooked rare, with mashed potatoes and wild mushroom sauce). It was good, but not as exciting as our pastas and pizzas.

We were in the mood for a chocolate cake, but unfortunately they had run out of it since it was so busy that night. Next time...

Definitely a must visit! I am hoping to go again for my birthday"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time giving this place 4 stars. This is more of a 3.5 star: 4 stars for good service and 3.5 stars for the just above average food. You better practice your Italian before you come here, because the menu is all in Italian and you have to read the description in English. I had a hard time reading the menu, since the place is too damn dark! I get it. They want to make the atmosphere all fancy and romantic by dimming the lights, but I can't imagine what those old people with already poor vision went through next to our table. The place is romantic/classy; a suitable place for mid age to old  couples to celebrate their anniversary.

The quality of the food is not quite 4. I tried the kiwi Risotto La Vecchia, because I thought it would be their best dish having the restaurant's name on it. It's basically a fancy Italian name for rice with jumbo shrimps. The rice was mixed with a kiwi sauce and there was a sliced strawberry in the middle with 2 jumbo shrimps on each side of the rice. 
My boyfriend ordered a Margherita pizza and asked them to add mushrooms and chicken to it. They compensated by adding those toppings, but removed most of the basil. The pizza didn't quite turn out how he liked it. The Caesar salad was very much to his liking though.
They serve fire drinks. I'm most likely to return here, but will probably order something else and try the fire drink."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had their grilled calamari and short rib ravioli. Sadly the ravioli sells out so go there earlier than 8pm.  I've had their pana cotta dessert too and that was also delicious. Loved the atmosphere good service and ambiance."}
{"text":"great place to for a date even though it is a little loud. they have Italian beer on tap and it was great to have something  different. food was excellent but I could have eaten more.
I had handmade gnocchi with ricotta and sun dried tomatoes. I felt like there were more tomatoes than gnocchi."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal and wonderful service.

Will be returning again soon for another bite and a full review. But have to say, five star thus far.

EXTRA TIP: Merry Christmas from La Vecchia. Night cap was on the house all December!!"}
{"text":"Had reservations and still waited an hour (not a great first impression to make on a new customer fyi). Our server was okay, and the food was just okay. I've had better before. The ambiance was great as everyone as commented, but then again, there are plenty of nice restaurants anywhere WITH great food as well. Probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"We made reservations at this restaurant on a Friday night and showed up right on time. As we walked in we saw about 7 people uncomfortably standing by the door and around the tables waiting to be seated. We waited for about 10 minutes until the gentleman who I assume to be the manager approached us and sort of looked at us. I quickly let him know that we have reservations for 8:15 under my friend's name and he sort of nodded and walked away. Another 10 minutes had passed and we were still awkwardly standing in the little space between the door and the tables. The gentleman walked by us and we inquired about our table one more time stating that our reservations were for 8:15 and it was already 8:35. To which he said, \"look man all these people have reservations, you just have to wait\". Afterwards by friend looked at him and said that we made reservations so that we wouldn't have to wait for the table. After waiting for another five minutes we decided to go somehere else as this place clearly didn't want to serve us. As we were walking out the restaurant the same gentleman screamed \"you're welcome\" to us with so much attitude. I definitely will not come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best midtown Italian food!! Everything I've ever ordered has been soooo good! It looks a bit tight but they have lots of seating also on their first floor, with a few party rooms if you need. I would recommend making a reservation if you can, it gets really busy. My go to is the rigatoni Romani .. To die for. And for desert, their caramel crunch cake. It's like la rocca but 100x better and super fresh. Go now!!! Also, delicious brunch!!"}
{"text":"Rigatoni was amazing. The chicken and pasta was delicious and paired really well with the wine. And our waiter was fantastic. Its also in walking distance of the movie theater so a really good dinner and movie combo. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing restaurant. Food tasted great and was not too complicated, and although I chose not to pair my branzino with a white wine I had an absolutely amazing red wine that our server suggested. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant. Delicious food. The manager, Pawel is very friendly, the waitstaff very knowledgable."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday for dinner. In spite of reservation, we waited for 15 mins! Our wait staff was good, but we felt like we were slightly rushed as it was weekend and they limit the time to 2 hours each party per table. Also, they don't let you order apps and main course separately, you have order together due to weekend. 3rd thing that I didn't like is that they were not flex with ordering I.e we tried to order a shrimp app without some ingredient and the waiter said because it's weekend we can't make any changes to the item!!!! This is the reason why I have this place a 3 star and it's only because food they got that! 

Ambience was good, food- slightly on the pricey side but all aside food was good. We wouldn't come back here on weekend because of above reasons."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian cuisine! Very traditional restaurant! The risotto is simply fantastic! Good service provided. Cozy place. A little bit pricy but it is totally worth! Perfect for celebrating a special date!"}
{"text":"Really like this spot.  Been here a few times over the years.  Even though its not in my neighborhood I go out of my way to go here.   Great tasting food.  Well prepared and great flavors.  Very straight forward in the approach both to the food and the presentation.  Matches the decor of the restaurant.  Feels like a place to get a good meal.

What sets this place apart for me is the level of service.  It is typically a busy restaurant (would recommend a reservation) in a smaller space.  Staff does a great time of turning around your table without you feeling rushed.  There have been no long pauses for service between courses and after meal.  This place is excellent in that regard and it really add to the whole experience.

Great place will be back again and recommend it to anyone who loves a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"Comparable to grazzi but a little bit fancier. Really tasty meal, and great service. Will be returning 

Great date spot also"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to we went there on our anniversary the service was excellent,  the food was amazing I couldn't be happier definitely we will keep on going back!!"}
{"text":"Superb. Small celebration for two with a reasonably-priced bottle of Prosecco. We shared the soup special (Mushroom and Spinach) and a Caesar Salad. Soup was awesome...so too was the flavor of the salad but it was a rather small portion considering the $11 price tag.

Wife had the seafood feature of Grouper with Lobster Tail over Risotto...I had the Scaloppine Diano Marina off the menu. Both were absolutely amazing! Hearty portions as well!

Service was friendly and timely. Not a cheap place but not outrageous either. Definitely will go back, even just for the veal."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last week and once we were seated ,we started to feel better . 
I must say that the food was really good . I had scaloppine Diano Marina and if you love meat , you Have To try it . Really tender and delicious . 

But I'm taking away a star for a very bad costumer service experience . We had reservations and yet it took them 25 minutes to seat us and meanwhile they kept insisting that we should wait  by the  bar . Now , all the bar stools were occupied and we had to squeeze ourselves between other tables and the counter and we had to excuse ourselves every five minutes when someone wanted to pass through . 

So summing it up .. Good food , great ambiance , bad service , snobby staff."}
{"text":"Oooh la la!! .... wait, that's French.  I meant... mama mia!  Lol.  Whatever the phrase, this joint is a must try Italian place.  The environment is pleasant to the eye with a fusion of modernity meets old world charm.  
The service is wonderful.  It's on the formal side, but to me, as long as they are good at what they do, i am satisfied.
Onto the food.  For appetizer i opted for Calamari Alla Griglia which is grilled calamari after fiding out that the Cozze Marinara mussels were not available.  The calamari was a good substitute though as the meat was super tender with just enough touch of flavor.  Then i moved onto Branzino, a pan seared fillet of Mediterranean Sea Bass with greens.  The taste of lemon garlic and white wine sauce was bold and unapologetic,  and so it should be.  To end the meal,  of course i had to go with tiramisu.  Heavenly."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who chose this place. Mood and romantic lighting inside with great service where they take your coat for you. There's the old school Italian charm. The Menu for my dish said \"whole calamari stuffed with shrimp, scallop, clams on spaghetti with oil\" whose brilliant idea was this!? Tasted sooooo good Omnomnom. 100% coming back!"}
{"text":"The pizzas we ordered were okay (not the best but not the worst either), but the wait to get our food was over an hour due to a large party inside, and staff wasn't very attentive to our table during this hour. Some other tables that ordered after us got their meals first. However, due to the long wait, they brought us a slice tiramisu, which we enjoyed. The tiramisu was delicious!"}
{"text":"Breaded veal chops with angel hair pasta
Ravioli with asiago cheese with cherry tomatoes
Grilled calamari- very tender
Tiramisu- moist
Friendly service but a little slow
Get reservations or expect to wait"}
{"text":"This was a girlfriend's get together lunch. The pizzas were great with fresh ingredients and the service was prompt and friendly.  They served us complimentary lemoncello after our meal.  Was delicious.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"They should re-name this resto Ambiance because you will fall in love with anyone you're with here. The atmosphere is very intimate, dimmed lighting and candles. They make great drinks and their menu staples are amazing like the gamberi bosco . The homemade ravioli is a must but last time I got the steak special and it was drenched in gravy but wasn't good and I left most of it on my plate. It's not cheap I'd recommend for a date you're trying to impress or girls night."}
{"text":"Came in here Sunday night for Dinner. Reservations are a definite must! We came in for our 6pm reservation and within less than an hour the place was totally packed to capacity.

The first thing that strikes you is the ambiance, dim lighting, chandeliers, with a cozy & romantic feel yet still causal enough for large groups or catching up with girl friends. Upon entering the male hostess kindly opened the door for us. After confirming our reservation he led us to a candle lit table near the back just past the bar along a stone wall. He then offered to take our coats which was a nice touch. The other side of the restaurant is adorned with framed black and white photos of Italian movie stars.

Our waiter was very friendly and upbeat and went over the specials for day followed by a basket of fresh sliced Italian bread which was soft and chewy and the perfect accompaniment to absorb the partnering olive oil and balsamic.

For appetizer we decide on sharing a round of bruschetta

Bruscetta La Vecchia - Baked to order focaccia topped with diced tomato and shaved parmiggiano cheese
The focaccia was light, crispy and warm which was a nice contrast to the perfectly seasoned cold diced tomatoes and shaved parm

For mains we all decided to go with pasta which seemed the way to go because in the entire restaurant I saw maybe only 2 pizzas go out and everyone pretty much ordered pastas. The pasta portion of the menu is divided into two sections: fresh made pastas and regular pasta but we all went with the fresh versions.

Agnolotti Di Monte -Half moon shaped pasta filled with ricotta cheese and spinach in a rose sauce
The Agnolottis were hugee and plump with a creamy ricotta filling and the rose sauce was soo flavourful, the best rose I ever had to date!

Pasta Special of the day - Gnocchi made with ricotta and spinach in a rose sauce
Plump tender and flavorful in that wonderful silky rose sauce, they should really consider adding this gnocchi dish to there regular menu.

Ravioli de Niro - Jumbo meat ravioli in a butter wild mushroom truffle essence sauce
Jumbo is an understatement, I don't think I ever seen a ravioli quite this large! The meat filling wasn't your ordinary ground beef either but tender pieces of shredded beef beautifully seasoned. This is the perfect ravioli for a meat lover!

Finally we all somehow still had room for dessert

Gelato a la Vecchia - Vanilla gelato drizzled with chocolate sauce, honey, toasted candied walnuts, and a shot of espresso poured over.
Like an icecream sundae with an italian twist! The vanilla gelato mixed with the espresso created a delicious coffee flavored cream plus the crunchy warm candied walnuts and the chocolate honey drizzle all the flavours & textured melded together perfectly!

Caramel Crunch Cake - Alternating layers of almond pecan meringue, caramel whipped cream, and caramel sauce.
A perfectly sweet combination of crunchy light meringue and fluffy sweet cream.

Overall a spectacular traditional Italian meal! Service was amazing, the restaurant was packed to capacity yet we were never felt ignored nor rushed. Our waiter always came back to check on us, plates cleared on time, and water refilled without asking. The fresh pasta dishes were outstanding, made with quality ingredients, packed with flavour and and the best I've encountered thus far!
I noticed a lot of comments about the place being \"too loud\" however I found the noise level comparable to most other restaurants and I had absolutely no problem hearing my table mates. 

If you want a memorable and quality Italian meal from start to finish definitely come here with reservations in tow and try there Fresh Made Pasta! It won't disappoint!"}
