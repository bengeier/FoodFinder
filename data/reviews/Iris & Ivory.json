{"text":"Would of given a better review if we were able to eat here. Says it's open until 3 on Saturdays we get here it's dark and closed. We are really disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge selection of tea for either on-site sipping or take-home brewing.  Bruch/lunch type of menu includes scones, quiche, salad, etc.  Food is diner-style quality Atmosphere is quaint & older female oriented. Situated in a mini-mall plaza. For my book club, it served us well!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe and tea house.   Some nice tea aromas when we walked in. Nice salads and sandwiches or wraps.  Homemade soup.  Lots of different teas to try..black teas, white teas, green teas, specialty teas.    Ordered some Buffalo pierogies with my sandwich and the waitress let us know they were spicy....Yes they were and Grrrrrrrrrrreat!   The Tuna Veggie Sandwich came with albacore tuna and some nice veggies, tomato, cucumber, celery and more.  Very good sandwich.  Looks like a nice place to have a sandwich or you can get your tea and crumpets."}
