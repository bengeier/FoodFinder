{"text":"This place is great ! Goat roti is the way to go !! I'd say sometime the dish plate rice is a bit mushy and obviously microwaved but doesn't matter add more pumpkin hot sauce and you are on !

He should seriously market his pumpkin hot sauce, it's insanely good spicy and tasty !"}
{"text":"'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'

i had the vegetable (potatoe and chickpea) roti with pumpkin. my senses may be dulled from being dead for so long, but this didn't help revive them.  the curry didn't have any distinguishing flavors from my store bought fare and the pumpkin spread (extra) went unnoticed in the mix,. +1 for size, it filled me up, and for price, ~ $8.50 with tax isn't deplorable, but it's still a one and done, not something i'd try again."}
{"text":"Went there tonight because I felt like eating some Guyanese food, mainly roti and man I'm telling you they make the best roti in Montreal. I've tried Curry House and the one everyone likes...Tropical Paradise. And don't get me wrong tropical was my favourite too until I came here. Now I'm not going anywhere but here. Even if it is a bit further for me. The taste is wonderful, the price is right and the staff are friendly. I had the goat roti with pumpkin and it was delicious. I was a little hesitant on the pumpkin but I'm glad I tried it. It gave the roti a nice sweetness to it that was very subtle and nice. I also had the chicken chow mein and that too was delicious. I'm a fan of spice so even their pepper sauce needs to be praised. Everything here is home cooked and never frozen. Authentic Guyanese food that tastes great!! ***two thumbs up*** =]"}
{"text":"You know what? I changed my mind, don't hold the pumpkin. Bring on the pumpkin! Bring! Bring!"}
{"text":"Jardin du Cari used to be be located on St Viateur where Comptoir 21 takes up space. The rotis are great - the pastry wrap is both moist and flaky and light in just the right way, and the addition of pumpkin to the filling is sublime. I usually wash down with a grapefruit Ting drink. Great for a winter lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The goat and pumpkin rôti is glorious! The peanut punch is delicious, but quite expensive if you order it to go (2.50 for a coffee cup). I definitely recommend it if you want some Caribbean takeout. Haven't tried sitting brown there yet."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spot in the mile-end. Love the goat rôti with pumpkin and lime Chili sauce. It's filling and brings the perfect balance of neat tenderness and sunny Caribbean flavours. Plus the family working in the kitchen is always sporting their lovely smile, taking me back to my dearest vacation memories."}
{"text":"Oh so delicious roti, well sized for the price. Very much hole in the wall, but hole in the wall you should know, if roti is your thing. Friendly (but not overly so) the staff are nice and relaxed. No one batted an eye when my two month old threw a short lived mini fit, and afterwards they came over and told me what a good baby he is (he's great! He fusses and then he chills out). I am partial to the goat with pumpkin (always add pumpkin!), but I'm sure all the options are fab."}
{"text":"I was not that familiar with Carribbean cuisine before my visit to this friendly and unpretentious spot near my friends house in Mile End.  The chic pea and potato curry roti was a splendid hang over cure that blew my palate away, and sent me into a deep mid afternoon nap.  I could tell that this would be my spot if i were to live in Montreal.  From price to taste to the kind owner, i'll be sure to stop by here one more time before i leave town."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but unfortunately uses a microwave to heat up food. Might've been that way since we ordered take out, but was definitely on the mushy side. Goat Roti tastes great!"}
{"text":"Followed Yelp reviews and ordered rolls with pumpkin (we got chickpea/potato and goat). Mm mm, so good. 

We got there around 9:15 and the shop has hours posted until 10, but we were told carry out only. Made sense after we waited ~40 minutes for our food. But still worth it. Especially with that spicy sauce (I wish I asked for extra, it's not as spicy as everyone has been making it out to be).

Good staple!"}
{"text":"Hummm des bons plats typiques de la Guyane, on se sent comme à la maison, que ce soit au niveau du décor, simple et convivial, et de la bouffe chaleureuse! Prix très raisonnables, service rapide et souriant..
A essayer à tout prix!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on one of my neighbourhood walks and was hooked by the lovely smell wafting from the doors.

I'm new to Caribbean food so I felt a little bit out of my element when I looked at the menu but our waitress explained everything and was really nice.

I got the chicken roti and it was soooo good! Really warm, filling, flavourful, and different. It was such a big portion that I had to take half of it to go. 

Adam got the goat curry and it came with vegetables, rice, and plantain! (I really liked the rice)

We also got a patty to share and it was just ok. Nice consistency but the taste was just ok, nothing distinguishable. 

They ran out of peanut punch but I'll try it next time!

Generous portions, good prices, friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Chickpea Roti is the best"}
{"text":"This is the St Laurent location of the family owned and operated Jardin Du Cari. Same bare bones decor as the rest, with maps and posters pinned to the walls, same delicious roti with pumpkin. The veggie roti with pumpkin is one of my favourite inexpensive comfort foods in town, I pick it up for dinner about once per week, and I get the man the goat. Make sure you get the hot sauce that usually comes with, and make sure you're a bit careful with it. I love spicey and am always tempted to slather this stuff everywhere because it's deliciously mangoy and lemony but it's also badass burn your insides hot. The perfect antidote if you've had too much of the hot sauce is the peanut punch, creamy and not too sweet or peanut buttery. Like an inexplicable number of places in the area, Jardin du Cari is closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Had the goat roti with pumpkin. It was very good! Family-owned and owner was nice! Prices are perfect for a inexpensive option around the very pricey area that is the Mile End. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places in Montreal that serves up Peanut Punch, a Trinidadian specialty which is basically like Peanut Butter Milk (as opposed to Chocolate Milk). Yes, it's exactly as yummy as it sounds!

As other posters have indicated, chickpea rolls, pumpkin curry, chapatis, potato roti, and the owner is exceptionally nice and friendly. 
Just go already."}
{"text":"Ça devait faire au moins 2 ou 3 mois que j'avais une rage pour un bon roti mais je n'étais pas certaine par où commencer à Montréal. J'en parlais donc à Risa qui m'a convaincue de changer tous les plans de ma journée simplement pour aller au Jardin du Cari pour essayer leur roti au poulet et à la courge. Et quel bonheur! Le roti, avec sa sauce épicée aux mangues (ne soyez pas déçu de la petite quantité, c'est plus qu'assez!) a transformée une journée pluvieuse bien ordinaire en un voyage dans des pays loin d'ici remplis de couleurs et de saveurs. Quel délice! Ma rage de roti a été comblée, mais en même temps, j'ai le goût d'y retourner pour essayer les autres plats du menu qui avaient l'air tout autant délicieux et savoureux."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean comfort food, worth every penny - just don't expect to run a marathon after a meal there."}
