{"text":"An everyday comfort food that you cant ignore...I just wish this location was around in highschool!!! I get the terminator sub...and then dose the huge amount of fries that they give you with the balsamic vinegar that is on every table.  The Rocknes salad is good but it is just iceberg lettuce so its really just a good tasting crunchy water but if you are in the mood for their dressing and pita bread, then its worth it!  Oh, if you want a heart stopper..get the cheese fries...=)"}
{"text":"Casual chain restaurant near popular mall. New place but old tired menu. Plenty of the typical salads, burgers and sandwiches.  Nothing spectacular but decent grub at moderate prices. Lots of kids and parents too if that is your thing.  If not, go elsewhere!  Service was friendly and cheerful and the bar is nice. There are better places around the mall, but if you're hungry and just looking for a burger & a beer, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"Decent options.  Spinach salad was very good.  Menu said NEW veggie medly soup, sounded awesome but server said they no longer have it.   Good price for kids menu, but lemonade is extra charge.  Next time I will try the saurkraut balls.   Giving a 4 because of  fast service, which is great when dining with kids."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup and spicy chicken sandwich tonight, wasn't bad but not impressed. Decor was outdated. The bartender was very nice and friendly, recommended the tortilla soup. Price was reasonable...nothing really stood out for me. I probably will only go back if I don't have any other choice"}
{"text":"Average food from a chain restaurant. Not that that's a bad thing if your in the mood for it. Good service, pleasant servers, clean restaurant. I had some southwest-type wraps which were pretty good."}
{"text":"I got a single cheeseburger and a side salad. My friend ordered a quesadilla.  We both enjoyed the food...Nothing special, but it tasted good and there was a lot of it - so a good value. Even something like a side salad is massive there. The server was rude though...he was rushing us even though there were plenty of open tables (he was asking if we needed boxes and bringing the check before we were halfway done). When my friend was considering dessert and said she didn't feel ready to eat more, he actually said that he couldn't blame her, since she ate a large amount already. Just not the best service. (note - I wrote this review last year, but just noticed it didn't publish at the time- that is why it is being submitted after the restaurant has closed)"}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I had been to a Rockne's and we loved it. The food was great and the service was great. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, plenty of TV's in the bar area & about 7 beers on tap.  A few of my faves include the Po Boy, BLT, and Cheddar Broccoli soup.  Fun fact: Rockne's signature sandwich 'the terminator' was a favorite of Aaron from season 10 of the Biggest Loser."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, when heading to bingo. It's clean. Always and fast great service. Server friendly. However this visit totally different. Weot sat right away.
Then we sat and sat and sat good 10 minutes went by. No server. My friend started searching for a server. 12 minutes her she comes. I can never finish my pop so I ask for it in a to go cup. She rolled her eyes, and got an atitude. 

After she brings the drinks, asked if we were ready to order..Duh..yeah..hello we been here 15 minutes waiting... We give her our order..30 minutes later we get it. 
Now mind you I ordered Mini-max and fries. My friend ordered bake potato and veggie. They had maybe 3 other tables. Also when she brought the order it was pretty much throw it on the table.

My friend was so upset at this point ,she asked the server to bring the bill and run the card ,now. 

Server rolled her eyes.
She brings the slips back to be signed she throws it on the table and runs.
Excuse , me I said and she kept going. So, that was it..I stopped the manager and let her know how we were treated. Next thing I know the server is in out face yelling at us. The manager came over to get her away from us.
However manager and other servers were VERY SWEET...and a bit in shock..
And we still left a tip.

So, will we go back  , huh  got think about that."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and  food greasy. Gross. No thanks."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge fan of the Max the Knife burger and I love The Terminator. We used to go to the one in Parma a lot and it seemed to go downhill. We stopped in to this Rockne's today and were so pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent.  Our server was very nice and brought our food out piping hot. Whomever was cooking really sent out nice food. It made me want to come back again for sure. The fresh cut fries with your sandwich are a must!"}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time. My husband loves the Max the Knife burger. We have noticed the past few times that the menu has changed a few times and the quality of the food just isn't as good as it used to be. I ordered a chicken salad this past visit and the chicken was not good at all. It seemed like it had been pre-cooked then tossed on the grill when ordered. The edges were chewy and overcooked. I don't know what has changed but I miss the old Rocknes."}
{"text":"Rockne's was always our go to.  But after tonight's visit that won't happen again.  We ordered a chicken tender salad, we got a grilled chicken salad the lettuce was brown and the pita was green.  My husbands fav has always been the Terminator sub. A 12 inch sub with roast beef and fries on it. The sub came tonight with little meat and lots of salad.  Prices have skyrocketed but quality has plummeted. Wake up Rockne's before it's to late!"}
{"text":"A local chain with good solid classic American food, excellent service, and an attractive setting. Ambiance is brass and oak, with lots of booths. Food is of high quality, well-prepated, and generous in proportions; many items (e.g. their excellent fresh-cut fries, their big fish sandwich, etc) serve two. Recommended. BTW: the Cuy Falls location is no more, and this is the closest to that area, right off Rt 8."}
{"text":"This place has a nice restaurant/bar atmosphere but the food is sub par. The burgers mentioned in previous posts are what directed me to this place. After ordering the most popular burger as per their menu advice, I learned not many of those posting here have ever had a good burger. The nachos were poor and the wings were frozen. Nothing homemade or not from a freezer or box. Servers were vey nice and professional with a nice beer selection. Not many other other places around there to get good food though."}
{"text":"There should be half star options. This chain is not about haute cuisine, it's classic American fare. The menu is big, 6 pages, soups appetizers, steaks, burgers, giant salads, huge sandwiches, and signature bacon cheddar fries. With such a varied menu, it's tough to do everything well, and unfortunately they don't. When they are on their game, the food is solid; hot, and a good value, when they're off their game, service is slow, food cold/greasy and disappointing. If I come here and get consistent quality this would be at least 4 stars, but because it's like roulette, it's 3. I so want them to be better, but I've been visiting for more than 4 years. It is definitely worth the \"spin of the wheel\""}
{"text":"First time I went with the family my mother got sick a few hours later. The second time I went was with friends and a friend and myself got sick a few hours later. The only reason there was a third is because my girlfriend worked there and she brought me a fish sandwich meal at work, except there was no fish on the bread, literally just bread and lettuce. Seems to intentional to just happen by chance, which shows me the lack of maturity of staff and leadership by the managers."}
{"text":"I love this Rockne's. The owners are on site and super friendly. Everything I've had has been excellent here and I try something new every time I go."}
{"text":"My food was not good at all!  I ordered a salad which was supposed to have grilled pineapple on it, and instead it was pineapple right out of the can.  Also, the chicken on my salad was cold, and tasted like it was out of a bag.  For the price you pay, I expected better quality food.   If I wanted the canned crap, I would have gone to the grocery store!  I don't know if all the Rockne's are like this, or if this owner is just trying to cut corners, not good at all!"}
{"text":"Went with my family for the first time. We got wings for an appetizer and they were all cold and we sent them back and received them another two times still cold and with them being the same wings we had attempted to eat. Our dinner even came out cold. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Knew of this place for years since I grew up on the area but only tried last week. Didn't realize what i was missing. Large menu of tasty bar and grille items with very reasonable prices. Appetizer sampler was yummy as as my gyro. My table mates raved about the soup and the salad. Portions were huge definitely allowing for leftovers. Fries were only meh and definitely skippable despite what others say. Go hungry or go home!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say but this was the worst experience my family and I have ever had at a Rockne's before. I put my daughters food in as soon as we arrived and it took 25 minutes and came out with our food. We came in for lunch and when I asked why a table got their appetizer and lunch before us when they got sat 15 minutes AFTER we had, the other waitress started to state that it was probably because they only got soup and salad. Well, funny because that is exactly what we had. The soup came out cold, I had to ask 3 times for coffee and our waitress was so behind you would assume another would come to her rescue. Not to mention the bugs flying around our food and having to swat them away the entire meal. Sorry Rockne's, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a chain, but the food is very good and you get large portions!!  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is attractive.  It has plenty of very large screen TVs.  There's a separate bar area.  Service was good.  You are sort of sitting close to other people but there are plenty of large booths.  We had the \"Tails, Tenders and Fries\" but we replaced the fries for the most delicious backed potato with butter and sour cream.  The reason we did that was because the amount of fries they give you is beyond HUGE!!  We had no room for desert; in fact we had enough left of over from our \"little\" dinner for lunch the next day!  I was told that their burgers are really good too.  I'd certainly go back there."}
{"text":"Since my eight year old is addicted to cheeseburgers, we stopped in before seeing a movie at the nearby theater. Seated quickly, pleasant server and a varied and enticing menu. All was great until we were surrounded by three booths of foul mouthed trash. Look, I like to swear as much as the next guy, but I don't suffer from Tourette's in front of children. 

I'd totally expect that kind of garbage clientele at a bar, but a family friendly place at 5PM on a Friday? Not so much. Thankfully, my kid was hyped about the movie, and we left pretty quickly. 

I've worked in hospitality for years, and know it's touchy to have to tell some guests to dial it down. I get that...totally. It's just way too bad that this experience ruined an otherwise pleasant and delicious visit. Probably won't be back unless I do some \"patron recon\" beforehand..."}
{"text":"Great service, food was good for the most part. Even if some of them where not cooked all the way I liked the fact that the French fries where real potatoes, and you got a ton of them. I was not impressed with my burger. I expected a real burger, not a pre frozen quick griller. All together it was ok."}
{"text":"Family dining at it's finest in Kent, but also what I think contributes to many of Ohio's expanding waistlines as their portions are HUMONGOUS.  It doesn't just serve fried, fatty food, it revels in it.  Every time I ate here, it was the only meal I had the whole day.   I'll definitely say that it's the best place to go to when you're having a terrible day and wish to drown your sorrows with food.  Certainly not for the health-conscious, but when you have the Co-Op downtown that wants $4 for a bunch of bananas, I'll take this instead."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom Brie soup and 1/2 philly beef sandwich. Both were excellent!  sandwich was so big I had to eat it with a fork and knife - couldn't pick it up. Service was very good - our server was very attentive and never left us alone for long. 
One complaint would be that the mixed drink I had was very small, weak, and grossly overpriced for what I got. I guess I'm not in Wisconsin anymore."}
{"text":"Went to this Rocknes first time today with group of co workers for lunch. Ordered a chicken salad. Ended up with a very bad upset stomach by end of work day and upset the rest of night. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not much of a chain guy but friendly service, good food.  Had the crock of black bean and side salad which they were happy to sub spinach.  Always forget about this place but will be back."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've ever eaten at where I was almost overcome by a desire to stand up and say, \"Attention everyone! You don't have to eat this crap! There are other restaurants! You can go elsewhere! Food doesn't have to taste like this!! Fly! Be free!\"

It tastes like what you get in a grade school cafeteria. 

Stupidly enough, I actually ate here twice, just to be certain the bad food wasn't a fluke. Terrible idea."}
{"text":"We recently visited this Rocknes for a last dinner with my college student daughter before going back to SF..This expirience was AWFUL!  We ordered the starter WAY before we ordered dinner..and both came out at almost the same time..the starter was COLD not cooked thru...we told the waitress...then..she took the platter back...and brought a new one back out at almost at the end of the meal. NOT GOOD.. also i felt soooo rushed to leave..got the \"do you need any boxes\" while I was still eating my sandwich..got the reciept before even asked if we wanted a dessert..and it was NOT even busy!!!.All I can say is I will not go back to this restaurant. Perhaps the manager should look into the servers  policy of \"heres your hat theres the door\"!! .. NOT FOR ME!"}
{"text":"Hor. Rih. Bul. Went here with my sister while driving across the country. Finally seated when the host got done flirting with the barmaid. I think our waitress was Vickie from Small Wonder. Just as charming, at any rate. We both started with French onion soup, a tepid brown ooze with what seemed like 'tater tots in the place of croutons, and covered with pre-sliced supermarket Swiss cheese. No time under the broiler. My sister ordered the salmon fillet. It was as hard as well-cooked chicken and covered with, I think, cherry coke. We're both pretty sure it came to the restaurant wearing its sear marks. I ordered a burger that was meh. If the real Knute Rockne's cooking was this bad, they ought to reopen the books on the Gipper's death."}
{"text":"My wife and I paid a visit to this location again, we have had good experiences in the past and this was no different.
We have several restaurants that we enjoy and decided we were in the mood for Rockne's today.
 After looking over the menu which consists of many pub style items, we opted for the nachos and spinach artichoke dip. The chips were freshly made and very tasty but we seemed to have more chips than dip and ran out too soon. This seems to be a norm for many restaurants.
 In terms of our meal, we are a big fan of their Fireside salad and it is the main reason we come. It comes with a whole chicken breast and is large enough for both of us to share. We do recommend asking for extra house dressing to go with it.
 We were hungry when we arrived and made the mistake of ordering a dinner to go with the salad. We usual opt for their excellent selection of  soup but being a hot day decided against it. 
 We ordered the Beer Battered Cod and we were not disappointed; As stuffed as we were, we needed to sample the yummy fish while still hot.
The fish's coating was fried to a crunchy golden crisp and the fish inside was moist and delicious. The only thing lacking were the fresh cut fries. I prefer a larger steak cut fry when eating fish and chips and these were small and greasy. Again, many restaurants are going this way but I am a fan of malt vinegar on my fries and the smaller cut does not absorb the vinegar's flavor like a thick steak fry can.
 Overall the meal was very good and our waiter, Wes was very attentive to our needs.
We will be back, :)"}
{"text":"There was no style, subtlety, or taste to the food. It was all just pure grease over quality. I didnt expect much going in, but but this was pretty bad. Bland, greasy, generic food. Sometimes greasy can be good (Melt, anyone?), but Rockne's is just a messy chain. Being from out of town, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just visited Kent, my old stomping grounds, for homecoming 2016. The next day, my friends and I (a mix of alumni and current students) chose Rockne's for lunch. We had a party of 7, most everyone from out of town.

We were seated promptly and hungry, so placed orders fairly quickly as well. Some of the party had ordered soup, and it arrived shortly after our order was placed. From that point on, we waited over an hour for the remainder of our meal.

The manager, Nick, came and explained that the order had somehow never made its way back to the kitchen, but assured us it would be at our table as soon as possible and apologized for the error. He offered free desserts for us all to make up for the wait time.

After seeing Nick, we waited an additional 20 minutes for food, and a portion of the order was wrong. Upon getting our meal, everyone was hungry and quickly enjoyed some of our favorites from our college days.

At the close of the meal, and after complementary dessert for the error, Nick also decided to take care of our meal for the additional wait time. It was definitely not necessary, but a much appreciated gesture. Coming from someone who also work sin the industry, Nick and his staff did the right thing, and will gain our return business as a result. Thank you Nick, and Rockne's of Kent! :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a quick pub/tavern meal. They have a pretty good variety of everything. I got side salad and crock of tortilla soup and it was great. The salad wasn't that impressive but it got the job done. The server did a great job on the soup and the cornbread is the best I've had in Cleveland.

Not sure how long the wait time usually is but I got my food in 5 minutes of placing my order and the couple next to me got theirs pretty quick too. 

I'd recommend for smaller groups 5 or less because it's mainly booths."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, clean bathroom. Food is large portions, tastes as good as it looks. French fries are fair-style food. Waitress brought us Andes mints, which my daughter loves. Has both Pepsi and Coke products, almost unheard of these days. Sprite is a hard soda to mix, but they had it right! I would eat there again, definitely!"}
{"text":"This is a place that we eat at, not regularly but often, since its located close to work. The service this time was wonderful.

We were seated immediately. The server came to our table immediately to get our drink order. We ordered tea and put our food order in at the same time.

Being that we were on lunch break, the food came in a timely manner.

My Mom and I both ordered their Spinach Bacon Salad with grilled chicken. Its never disappointing! Its just the right combo of deliciousness and its healthy. I left satisfied with leftovers.

Overall, great environment with tv's and soft lightning. A nice place to de-stress a bit from work."}
{"text":"I had the gyro which was tasty as anything I could have gotten in a bigger city. The chicken sandwich was huge, but not particularly flavorful. 

Our server was wonderful and attentive. The hostess left a lot to be desired; her attitude on a Monday night during the dinner hour (not a rush, mind you) was very cold. 

We will most definitely return as the food was fast, tasty, inexpensive, and as-advertised."}
{"text":"Welcome to Kent State.  

Personally I could never get through a meal here.  Think fried grease with a topping of fresh pork rendered bacon fat and french fries.

Blech..."}
{"text":"Would have given the place a better review an all around good eating establishment. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was a solid dish. The down side is my friend ordered the terminator and to make a long story short he didn't fee well after. He ended up getting food poisoning. So if you want to take the risk of going there and getting food poisoning be my guest but I know I won't be dining out there for a long time to come"}
{"text":"Why did Rockne's change their house dressing?! It was my favorite but since they've changed it, it's not really all that great. Every once in a while I'll get a craving for a good Rockne's salad, but I end up being disappointed because their house dressing just isn't very good anymore. Luckily there are other tasty foods to get, but this change will likely have me visiting less frequently."}
{"text":"I had a chance to have a buffalo chicken salad. It was so wonderful. I love eating at this place. The service is always great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I dream of you when I am a way, Buffalo Chicken Salad with beer! 
This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 6 or 7 times now. The service varies at times depending upon how busy the restaurant or bar is, but it's generally ok (I have yet to have a terrible experience with the service). The beers are kind of expensive if you don't go during happy hour. In my opinion, the food is average, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I really like the cheesy ham and potato soup and the terminator sub and my girlfriend always gets the the pasta salad. If you're looking to grab a quick meal, watch a game or just grab a beer, it's not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Salads to go, way too small & super thick dressing! Go to the Rockne's in Fairlawn or Cuyahoga Falls if you want nice portions."}
{"text":"I go here every so often with the family. It is your typical bar food - they have a wide menu, so there is a lot to choose from. I like the chicken & dumpling soup or the gyro. The fries are delicious, and enough to share if you get a side of them (or even just eat someone else's side of them). The bacon & cheddar fries are also delicious if you are looking for something completely unhealthy. They got rid of their amazing honey mustard dipping sauce, or changed it somehow - it just isn't the same as it was when I was little. I used to be addicted to the stuff. The service is good - I have never had any complaints about it in all of the times that I have gone. Overall, it's your average bar/pub restaurant and food."}
{"text":"How does this place have such a low rating?  I don't even live in the area anymore, and I still hail Rockne's Terminator sub as one of the best subs I've had in my life.  Their cheese fries are pretty amazing too (ask for ranch, though: they do need it!)  I can't really speak of the service, as it has been years since I've been to this particular location, but I can say I've never had a bad experience.  Super cheap prices, great pub food, relaxed atmosphere -- I love Rockne's."}
{"text":"Yukkkkkkkkk.  This place has definitely had its day. 
Salads are weak, and just thrown together. I honestly cannot believe ppl still give this dude their money. 
When I was the head cook at a little place in the falls.... The owner tried to conspire against me and brought one of Rocknes' cooks into steal my recipes. (I was way smarter than them tho...), and he told us that they don't \"cook\" anything for real except the hamburgers and something else that I can't rembr. He said they have a WALL of microwaves in each kitchen (like 20 of them).... And that's what you are all paying for!!!!
Nuked food. Ha. I find that hilarious. 
Keep on giving them your business. Old man Rockne is laughing all the way to the bank."}
{"text":"Still good. Hostess ignored our request for a patio table. Seemed like she didn't care."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Ohio, I have fallen in love with this place. They have nice portion sizes, and the variety of the menu is astonishing. I am a vegetarian, and I always get the soup (tomato) and salad. The food is always delicious, and it is reasonably priced as well. The house dressing and the pita bread with the soup are my favorite parts :)"}
{"text":"Just sat at the bar for 15 mins. Noone approached me, not a bartender,mgr, server. The hostess was the only person who spoke to me, and she wasn't even there when I wanted help to get service. So I left. Never going to try Rockne's after that. 2:30 on a Monday, they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"My first visit here happened to be for lunch by the looks of it many others have made the same choice today. Although the restaurant was nearly full the service was outstanding, the four of us were seated immediately upon arriving at about 12:30 PM mid-week. The menu is filled with a large variety of options so there is definitely something for everyone. Although I eyed the terminator sub I chose the Rockne's Grilled Chicken Salad which arrived in a giant bowl lined with grilled pita bread (I'd ignored the pita so I can't comment on the pita). The salad greens and veggies were fresh, crisp and chilled with nice portions of crispy bacon, sliced and diced Swiss cheese and topped with a perfectly grilled and sliced chicken breast, the chicken breast was moist and tender and seasoned lightly I think this chicken would work well on one of their subs, wraps or sandwiches. I chose hot bacon dressing on the side and it was extremely flavorful, very light and worked very well with this salad. 

I have been to several Rockne's locations over the years but this may have been the best experience to date. I am sure I'll be back at some point when traveling to the area."}
{"text":"My in laws love this place so I've been there a number of times. Their food is lack luster and overpriced. Sometimes you will be surprised. They may serve the worst pasta I have ever had. Their soups and salads are decent. Have had some decent service there but also some really bad service. The time that took the cake was when I paid and the girl didn't give me back my credit card. She swore she did which led to us tearing apart the couches and looking under the table. Despite numerous times telling her she didn't give it to us, she claimed she did. We sat there for another 15 mins and all of a sudden the manager comes out of the kitchen with my credit card which the waiter had dropped on the floor and was half kicked under a shelf. We were issued basically no apology."}
{"text":"Terrible food. General Tso's chicken stir fry was horrible! Just tasted like teriyaki sauce from a bottle! Veggies in it were from a stir fry bag I could've bought from giant eagle! $10 for this, really???? My daughter had the wings n fries for $10? Tiny wings included! Now I know why I avoid the chain restaurants! I tried them about 10 years ago, and nothing has changed! Don't go here! A major rip off!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Rockne's for years, but this time we had an issue with the hostess that was completely and totally ridiculous. My wife who is not somebody who complains that restaurants called the manager over and explained exactly what happened. His response was shrugged his shoulders and say sorry and walk away. Customer service here. There is none we will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for dinner.  Again the food was okay.  Its nothing to complain about, but also nothing to rave about either."}
{"text":"I went to grad school in Kent, where I first discovered Rockne's. I remember loving Rockne's for some reason, probably because they have fresh cut fries and Dr. Pepper, my two greatest loves in the food kingdom. However, I also remember really liking their salads. I have been to the Rockne's in Brooklyn a couple of times now and haven't been impressed. I got the Greek salad yesterday and found the lettuce very disappointing. It was just ice berg and it didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't let that stop you from going though; if you have to meet up with some folks who like going to places like Applebee's or Damon's or some crap like that, you can go to Rockne's and feel a lot better about yourself. It is local and has a bit more creativity going on in the menu than those national chain places that some people might drag you to."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere and food okay but very poor service..  The restaurant has a lot of potential but restaurant needs a better management."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very popular with a very pleasant interior. Wait staff was friendly and prompt. They came back to our table several times during the meal to check that everyone was happy in our large party and without any phony smiles. Portions are VERY generous so if on a budget, one could easily spit an order. Good example of what a successful chain restaurant should be like.

Will go back the next time in town."}
{"text":"So I disagree with the $$.  This is a very inexpensive place to eat.  The food is okay and you get great portion sizes (I mean huge).  If you are looking for a family friendly place to go that will not crush your wallet, this is the place.

This is a solid 3 star place and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"First of all, the environment is very cozy and inviting.  The meals have large portions and everything tastes great.  Where we sat, the servers were in a raised area so they could quickly attend to you and our waitress was great.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The last two trips here for me have been disappointing. Have not ordered anything complicated, the stir fry and sandwich. Both were just ok. The fries here are not good."}
{"text":"Rode up from Columbus, went to the HD store and then stopped her for lunch/dinner place was empty so we was a little worried. Lol. But we decided to try anyway. Ordered single cheeseburger & side salad. Wow!! The salad alone was huge!!! It was ok but now waiting on burger.. Scott got The max The Knife. So hoping it's yummy!!! So we got our food great burger! It was good. Hope they keep in. Business not to may ppl are here."}
{"text":"After multiple visits to the Fairlawn Rockne's I'd actually begun to dislike Rockne's.
Tonight Danielle and i stopped for dinner. Just sandwiches. I got the mini max and she had grilled cheese. We both had French Onion soup. Loved the soup. I ordered another cup to go. 
It wasn't perfect though. They sat us right next to the kitchen which sucked. The entire staff seemed to be sitting at the nearby bar annoyingly laughing, doing shots and making plans for later that night. If you're done with work, go away. 
That said, I'll definitely go back for the French Onion soup."}
{"text":"Fast, good service. I believe I got the Firestone salad, the bacon on it didn't taste right the last time I went there. Probably won't order a salad from there again."}
{"text":"It had god service for a good price. The food was good but it it was very greasy and there was not enough bun and it fell apart. Nether the less I give give this a four out of five."}
{"text":"I probably should have written this a year ago when we tried out this restaurant. I ordered their beer battered fish and chips; the menu said they were the best. I never got the fish and chips. The waitress instead delivered a fish sandwich on a large hogie (?) bun. I was starving and started on the sandwich. I happened to look over at the table across from us and noticed a dude with a nice plate of fish and chips. Then it dawned on me, I remembered that guy ordering a fish sandwich. I had his sandwich and he had my fish and chips. I felt pretty dumb for not remembering what I had ordered, but also pretty agravated that the waitress had screwed things up. 

The place was packed and noisey, no room to breath, reminded me of TGI Fridays in that respect. Basically just another cookie-cutter chain. They had their chance and blew it.

Yeah, I should have pointed out the mistake. I should have been more attentive."}
{"text":"I visited Rockne's for lunch, arriving about 12:40.  The place was fairly busy, but there was no wait and I was immediately taken to a table.  My server promptly approached to take my beverage order, but I decided what I was going to get before I visited (based on other reviews on here and viewing their online menu): the gyro salad.  The salad is basically a deconstructed gyro sandwich; even down to the \"dressing\", which is actually tzatziki sauce instead of what most of us would call salad dressing.  After reading other reviews on here, I noticed on the menu that they specify you can get shredded lettuce on request...which I'm glad I did.  In contrast to other reviews on here that mention olives on the salad that were not mentioned on the menu, I did not get olives (was hoping I would); maybe the other reviewer just had a new person in the kitchen that day.  My salad included a pita (cut into four wedges and on the bottom/sides of the bowl), lettuce, two cucumber slices, two tomato wedges, a generous amount of feta cheese, and four strips of gyro meat.

Pros: The meat had additional seasoning on it that I'm not used to getting on gyro meat (most that I've ever had was just sliced and grilled) and I liked the extra flavor that this added.  It was also grilled nicely; just lightly browned around the edges.  As I mentioned above, they were generous with the feta cheese; definite plus for me! They also brought out two cups of tzatziki sauce, which gave me enough to have with the meat and also have some on my pita.

Cons: The four slices of meat were barely a normal portion; I'm accustomed to most restaurants being more generous with their gyro meat portions since it's not a terribly expensive meat.  Also, the pita was incredibly wimpy; I definitely hope this is not the same pita they use for the gyro sandwich, as it would fall apart and barely be large enough to actually hold sandwich components.  As I ate it, there was no chewy texture I'm used to with Mediterranean cuisine; it looked and tasted like they just pulled a cheap pita out of a bag, cut it into wedges, and dropped it in the bottom of the bowl...there was nothing to really make it belong.  If you're not going to invest in a higher-quality pita, it would've been much better to grill it and just serve it on the side.

Overall, not a bad salad.  It was reasonably sized and everything seemed fresh.  It met my expectations as a place that was not one of the big national chains, but it wouldn't be somewhere I would want to visit often."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have a great kids menu and a great selection.  I love their salads they are better than most places. The pasta salad on romaine is one of my favorites. The sandwich selection is nice, fries do not come with the sandwiches but a side of fries everyone can share and the fries are oh so good in my opinion. I also love the sliders they are super tastey."}
{"text":"Visited here recently. I had a rocknes salad, my husband had a burger and my brother had a Asian fusion bowl. We all ordered water to drink. I got my salad all it was was chicken 2 tomatoes pita slices dressing on a bed of lettuce. Our waiter came back with a clear pitcher and refilled our drinks. I drank it, it tasted weird. I told my husband to ask about it. I went to the restroom.I got sick. The waiter said oh sorry i brought you soda water.i have a sufa allergy. Never again"}
{"text":"Well the service was good. Neil did a great job.  We ordered potato skins and they were good. My husband ordered the pasta and chicken was good. I ordered the baked cod which came half cooked.  They took it back cooked it. Over all it was an ok place nothing special."}
{"text":"Rockne's in Fairlawn has been one of our \"go to\" places to eat ( at least once a week or every other week ), until this visit on 3/11/18.
The menu was updated and finally all the sides have a separate page. I wanted to swap out o-rings for the fries until we were told that o-rings are a \"premium side\" and an additional charge would apply. No mention of the extra charge or what is or isn't a premium side. STRIKE ONE!
Our server was not the best, forgot about our request for extra ice and an extra side of BBQ sauce. (Found out later from our server that sauces & dressings are limited with your meal)  At the end of our meal we asked for an ice tea in a to-go cup (since we never had a chance to request a refill during dinner)...then we were told there would be an extra charge for the to-go ice tea! (I'll bet Rockne's will be charging for ice water very soon!) STRIKE TWO! We asked to speak with a manager and no one stopped by our table. STRIKE THEEE! ( this really didn't surprise us as we have NEVER see a manager interact with a customer... \"how was your meal?\", \"Thanks for stopping in\", \"how could we have improved your dining experience with us\", etc., etc., etc...) The least you can do is to have a sheet put into your menu that lets customers know that the following changes are necessary, blah, blah, blah...instead of having your servers explain everything to the customers, which is really unfair to them. 
Good Luck Rockne's ... you just lost a loyal 20+ year customer, that you probably never knew you had!"}
{"text":"The parking lot is always busy so wanted to check it out and I must say I don't get it!   Menu is too big and the staff has a hard time understanding it all.  Wasn't impressed at all.  The food was very disappointing, plain and boring.  It just didn't seem like restaurant food at all, it was something I would have been disappointed with even if I had made it at home.  It would take a lot of convincing for me to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Not bad...not spectacular. Extensive menu to fit every taste. I like the mini max...it's like a better version of a Big Mac. I love the fresh cut fries when they're cooked enough. Rockne's is always a solid option for American fare."}
{"text":"I've been to several of the Rockne locations in the area. Today, I ordered a margarita with salt, but the waitress (Richelle) recommended that I get it with ice instead of frozen, as the frozen ones don't taste right??? I ordered the famous Reuben Sandwich, which was large enough that I took home half of it. Cost for the margarita and the reuben sandwich came to $14."}
{"text":"I USED to enjoy this restaurant - no matter which the location - It USED to be a good expereince.  

BUT, the last several years each time I have gone it's been one disappointing meal after another.  Service is hit or miss ...more and more often it misses. What used to be one of our first choices has become the restaurant we go to when there is no other choice.  It's as if they don't try or care any more if the product that they put out is good.

The menu has always been filled with long time favorites mixed with new interesting new items.  Now I find the long time favorites cheapened down to the point that the only thing resembling the favorite is the name.  When I decide to try something different, now I am ALWAYS disappointed.

The favorite salads are now bowls of iceberg with little else...regardless which salad you get they now all taste like a bowl of iceberg.  So chose something different... maybe fish sliders - 3 Van DKamps fish fillets on regular size buns with neon orange \"cheez\" slices slapped on on a embarrassingly large plate heaped with luke warm fries. Were is the person that used to care that they were putting out a good product.

The last two months I have had occation to dine at a Rockne's numerous times. More often than not, someone in my party suffered later that night or the following day. After my recent experience I am done with trying to give this local business - my business."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and busy on a Tuesday night. Servers are friendly and attentive. Huge menu has something for everyone but mini Max the knife was poorly executed with hard patties and an almost nonexistent bottom bun. Glory days seemed to have passed on this now chain - was better as a one off tiny bar in original location."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised w/ the White Chili.  Pretty tasty.  And thank you Rockne's for having Elliott Ness on Tap! :)"}
{"text":"Soup and salad a great deal. Chicken tortilla soup creamy and rich, not spicy but very flavorful! 
Would come back!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was pretty good. I had the Gyro Salad and it was okay. The meat in it was very good and so was the pita that came with the pizza. The service only gets three stars. While they were very nice they didn't keep our drinks filled up. Other than that Rockne's is a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is lackluster. Every time I go here the waiter takes forever to bring the drinks and then disappears and never asks if we need anything. The last time we ate here, the waiter tricked us into ordering double the amount of food we wanted. I guess that is good for business but it is bad for customer service. The portions are huge which I really like, they are great for those cheat meals and the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. I would just appreciate a little better service and more attentive waitstaff. Most of the people are friendly, but they need to step up their honesty game. I don't want to spend $50 dollars on food enough for 6 people when there are only two of us."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan. 

Normally I avoid chains like they cause SARS, but Rockne's is a big exception. 

Three words: Cuban black bean soup 

Ok, four- you'll have to forgive me, I'm so absorbed by the memory of my meal that I've forgotten how to count. 

Beyond the food though is some of the best customer service I've ever had. They show up right when you need them (how do they know), they leave promptly, they're always friendly, and the food is always good. 

Always. 

Rockne's, you make my trips to Akron way more tasty, and I heart you for it. Never change."}
{"text":"had horrible service here the first time, then it got better the second time. food is ok, not great."}
{"text":"I've had a very pleasant meal today.  The service was fast and very nice.  I had soup and salad. The salad was huge and the mushroom soup was delicious as always.  A few other diners were here as well, but the place remained relatively quiet, and the music was not so loud that it disrupted normal conversation.  I'm glad I gave it another go."}
{"text":"The food tastes okay, good quantities, moderately speedy service, boring decor, way overpriced, a good place to have a conversation or to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I go to Rockne's frequently. I love their \"Big Salads\". However today was a shock, I ordered the same salad I always get, it comes in a large bowl with a pita cut into 4 pieces. When the salad was delivered to my table it was on a plate and it was no more than 1/2 the size of  what I normally get. It also only had 2 pieces of pita. When I asked the waitress about what I assumed was a mistake. I was told \"we changed our menu, that is what you get.\"  I said I was 1/2 the size of the normal salad, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. The salad still cost almost $9, what a complete ripoff!  To make matters worse my wife got a soup & salad ($2 less than my salad) her salad was the same size if not larger than mine. The interesting thing is the menu still shows a large salad in a big bowl!  If you were a fan of the \"Big Salads\", beware next time you order. To top it all off the service was fairly poor."}
{"text":"Four stars because it is what you would expect out of a restaurant like this. Difference is that the service is always spot on. Large variety of food that is decent and comes in large portions. Sandwiches and salads are very good. They do need to add a happy hour in bar area."}
{"text":"How bizarre to see an average, chain restaurant so packed.... why???

Okay, I know this sounds petty but here it is.... both their interior & menu's appearance is so dated and primary. Very tired looking.    If they cannot get into this century, how will they do in the kitchen?   My first impression skeeved me out on the whole idea of eating there.

Service was good.  Food was fine.  But nothing about it was memorable.   It was just a means not to have stomach rumble and blood sugar pummel."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst sit-down restaurant I have ever been to as far as food goes. The service was decent, but the food tasted like the can."}
{"text":"Lunch on Sunday the 8th.  As always the food was fantastic.  Our server needs some serious training.  I did not catch his name but he was extremely loud, rude and arrogant. He got upset with us because we sat there for over 10 - 15 min without drinks so I asked the hostess for assistance.   Note to servers, if you do not like your job, leave and find something else.  Note to GM's, watch and listen to how your servers interact with guests.  I will eat there again however if he is our server I will walk out."}
{"text":"After one visit I obvoiusly can't speak for the entire menu, but the beer-battered fish might be the best I've ever had (and I've done the fish-and-chips binge in London...). Nice ambiance, generous portions, reasonable prices, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  And they definitely give you a lot of fries. It kind of reminds of a 50's style restaurant.  But it also is a Sports Bar with a delicious menu.  The meals I get are always enough for me to take some home.  Plus my kids are part of their birthday club."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite with all the options, personal favorite, Rocknes salad with lite sweet n sour dressing... a little bit of everything for everyone, including a pretty decent bar and bacon cheddar fries"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rockne's for years.  Great alternative to Friday's/Applebees which I'm not a fan of.  I've never had a bad meal there.   My husband and I were on the west side, attending our daughter's basketball game and used that as an opportunity to stop at Rockne's.  Waitstaff is always friendly, food is always hot and fresh.  This visit we ordered a burger (me) and the fish sub (hubby) and of course those handcut fries!   I've had just about everything on the menu at some point, appetizers, sandwiches, soup, salad, pasta, entrees and this visit did not disappoint. The price is right, $22.00 for meals and beverages.  I'll be back....again and again."}
{"text":"Always really good food and excellent service. We eat in fairly often and place to-go orders even more frequently. Always correct, always good food."}
{"text":"Take out Review - Very busy location handles busy nights well.

Gyro Salad - salads come with dressing in cups without having to ask... be sure to order a Gy-row salad and not a Hee-ro salad... since they don't seem to know how it is pronounced... and if you don't like olives they will omit them... not that they are listed on the menu. The dressing is very bland and thick... but there is a good portion of commercial gyro meat... you can get chopped or shredded lettuce on request... if you don't the pieces are VERY large.

Bacon Cheeseburger - the default is a double patty, but you can get a single on request.  Bacon was well cooked and the patty flavorful.  The tomato slices weren't ripe and didn't have any flavor, but the lettuce and tomato were placed on a bun so they didn't sog on the way home.

Burger Platter - PILES of fries... some were shoe string, others steak fries... all jumbled together... so something for everyone?

None of the Rockne's locations have desserts... all have plenty of fried items for appetizers."}
{"text":"If I had a friend visiting from another country and wanted to show them everything that is wrong with American dining, I'd bring them to Rockne's. If what you love is frozen food thrown in to a fryalator or microwave, then this is the place for you. Enormous portions of undercooked/cold food."}
{"text":"It's Rockne's.  Pretty much Akron's answer to Applebee's and Ruby Tuesday.

Service is generally good, but the food is, meh...fries that are too greasy, sandwiches that don't really inspire words to write about.

It's average at best.  There's better out there, but not really in Kent."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food. Great service. I recommend the salad. Very filling. I liked that they were able to get my food so fast and it is very cheap for how much you get. Great place to go on a budget."}
{"text":"I remember coming here as a freshman at Kent State, lo those many years ago in the 2001-2002 year.  Rockne's was one of the few local establishments that accepted our little meal debit cards that anyone participating in band camp was given, so off we all went for some inexpensive and greasy food.  I remember it all tasting so good at the time, but this was when I was 18 and still rather unevolved when it came to appreciating freshness/quality/healthiness in my meals.

Give it a go if you're a student at KSU or visiting one, but otherwise, I'm sure you could find something a bit higher caliber in the outlying area!"}
{"text":"I swear I have done this review before.  Normally a very busy place, and part of a chain.  The menu is fairly standard fare for the Apple/TG/O'char/bar style family restaurant place.  Not as much junk (there's a better word here) all over the walls as most.

They specialize in the sandwich, Several options, beef ones are very good and hard to decide against.  The salads are made with green stuff.  The fries are fresh cut medium sized and you need one order for two people.  This is why there's malted vinegar on your table people!  But back to sandwiches, today was Po Boy.  The Po Boy is BBQ pork, with BBQ sauce, a couple of fries (not really sure why), cheese and cole slaw.  For the north, this was pretty good BBQ pork because of fresh egg bun.  Decent size, but not as good as the steak sandwiches.  

They have good Tex Mex rolls, not spicy.  The fried mac & cheese starts well, but three is about as far as you want to go.  Full bar and a dozen drafts for good measure.  Good stop for meal if you at SouthPark mall."}
{"text":"You have ate here before, you just don't know it.  Every Apple-TG-O'Char- blah blah, bar not a bar restaurant, they look the same inside with different levels of junk hanging from walls/ceilings. This place has least amount of junk, but same heavy dark wood trim over walls. 

Their game is sandwichs.  The menu is pretty good size, and has some interesting sounding items.  I have previously had southwest wraps, very good.  But I went for double bacon cheeseburger very fresh and juicy.  Had to add fries to make a platter, really hate the idea a burger is ala carte!  My god its a burger!!  And this place is not a 5-star deal.  The fries are thin and fresh cut, but not crispy or greasy.  The salads are just that, nothing special in size  or content.  The appitizer platter maybe best thing on menu.

This is a good everyday place.  The service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"I usually love Rockne's but this particular one was disappointing. I met my husband here last night for dinner between his two jobs. The service was fast and friendly but the food was off. I ordered the pasta salad which is my go-to. It's my favorite salad on the menu! However, the salad I got last night was skimpy on the pasta, onions, and chicken. There were literally 3 pieces of chicken on top of my salad that were the size of my thumb. The veggie ingredients were kinda warm like they sat out a long time. I barely made it home before I got sick. I doubt we'll be visiting this Rockne's again any time soon. Hopefully they can take a look into their food and prep. Something isn't quite right."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have never had a bad meal or bad service. Even when it's crazy busy the servers are hustling their butts off. They have the best raspberry ice tea around. Some of my favorites are the Ruben and of course the burgers. A must try are the breaded and deep fried green beans!! Addicting!!If you're a sports lover there are tv's everywhere. Good for families or a date night. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hi, welcome to Rockne's, how about some Pizza Shooters, Shrimp Poppers, or Extreme Fajitas? Hell no. That's kinda what I expected when we walked into this place. I couldn't tell you the last time I visited a Rockne's. Actually, before this visit I'm not sure I ever set foot in one. Having lived out of the state for the last 5 years my memory's a tad shoddy. Anyway, back to my story.

The wife and I were on the roam for some grub. It was Thursday, we were lazy and Rockne's was just down the road. Why not? How bad can they be? With low expectations we walked in, the place was basically empty. Short meet and greet and the walk to the table was underway. A right, another right, and left. We were seated in one of the raised levels toward the back by one of the wait stations and near the fireplace. Yeah, a fireplace. I'm just as surprised as you. The atmosphere is definitely chain-esque. The palate green, red and yellow and slightly sticky. I really dug the old-time photos on the walls - my favorite was a shot of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone sitting on a stoop together.

Our server was quick on the uptake, sort of friendly and even-keeled in a comforting Cleveland kind of way. Her young face scarred prematurely by the age lines of the service industry she painfully forced a smile. How about a beer? I see they've got Great Lakes on tap. I'll take a Dortmunder. Sure thing. Five minute wait followed by, \"I'm sorry sir (ouch, sir. Make me feel even older, why dontcha) we are out of Dortmunder.\" Fine, I'll go with the Eliot Ness. A fine amber ale if there ever was one. 

The menu at Rockne's reads like a who's who of artery clogging, mega portioned, Honey Boo Boo Americana. No, I wasn't staring at the rather rotund woman at the other table, her face buried in her pile of fries. Giant salads, dozens of sandwiches, bacon cheddar fries, mushroom and brie bisque, a monstrosity of a Big Mac-inspired burger called Max the Knife that features a pound of beef in four patties, cheese, shredded lettuce, pickles, onions and Rockne's own special sauce - held together with a giant knife buried hilt deep in he center. It's disturbing in its excess yet somehow delightful. On with the show.

White Chicken Chili - This was a perfect dish for a cold January evening. Thick chili packed with beans and cheese and a nice level of heat. It came served with a side of tri-colored tortilla chips and a small cornbread cake.

Garden Salad - The wife opted for this along with her chili. A nice-sized portion of iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, a halved hardboiled egg, a couple olives, julienned carrots, shredded cheddar and plenty of buttery, crispy giant croutons. The honey mustard dressing, served in two small cups, was some of the thickest I've ever seen. A healthy salad? Sort of. Not a bad salad. Everything appeared and tasted fresh.

Spicy Bacon Cheddar Fried Chicken Sandwich - I went all in. This sandwich was massive. Two full-sized fried chicken breasts served on a buttery kaiser roll topped with mayo, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and several crispy strips of bacon. The famous Rockne's knife plunged deep down the center. The chicken was crispy, juicy and tender and just the right amount of spicy. Where the hell did this beauty come from? 

 Mini Desserts - More places should do this. A selection of \"just enough\" sized desserts. Served in small cocktail glasses we went with the a chocolate cookie crunch and red velvet. I thought the cookie mousse was tasty and smooth and the red velvet was decent (I didn't get the grapes that came with it though). Mostly whipped cream but a nice finish.

As I said before we started this whole thing, my expectations were low. I didn't think it would be much better than Applebe's or Fridays. It was. Sure, Rockne's is doing their part to contribute to the obesity epidemic. Sure, it's a chain with plenty of kitsch and stereotypes. But I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The food was tasty, the service fast and friendly, and the restaurant pretty clean. Maybe it was my lowered expectations, maybe it was the growling stomach to which I must answer. Whatever, it was just pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I ate here twice.  The food was great!  The atmosphere and service was also good."}
{"text":"Always have the best food and service at this location! Kelly is an amazing waitress and every time we go here we ask for her. The firestone salad is my absolute favorite! Their chili is always to die for! This location never lets me down!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken salad is exceptional.  Always think  I'll get something else but never do.  Service is quick and the price is right."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good old fashioned comfort at a fantastic price. To be clear, Rockne's is not high end but it is also not a bar and does not serve bar food. Its a family restaurant thats a good step higher than bar caliber. Their menu is extensive, featuring steaks, burgers, fajita platters, pot roast dinner to beer battered fish and chips and French onion soup served in a big crock. Their coleslaw is crisp, fresh and delicious. Our waiter was Brian and he highly recommended the pot roast. Indeed tasty.  Most of their huge dinners are under 10 bucks! Come hungry because they serve a lot of good.  Everything is homemade. Clean and cozy. Finished wood and lamps throughout. Dimly lit but not dark. A few large tv's placed subtlety throughout so you can watch the big game. Service is fast and no nonsense. Pressed copper-esque ceilings. Easy in and out. Rockne's is a big winner and gets my first pick for 2017."}
{"text":"Don't often take the time to write a bad review... salad was a head of lettuce with cold steak from a bag, appetizer tasted like it was made by children at a local pool snack bar. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The food has been nothing but amazing and you get a lot of it!  Wait can be long during peek hours, but what place isn't.  Try the Firestone salad with buffalo sauce.

Update: I also recommend the Max the Knife or the Terminator Sub."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places in Streetsboro. Very friendly staff and the food is very good. The portions are HUGE though for most meals! The thing to get here is any one of the Salads. I've yet to have one that I do not love, and they, of course, are huge too! You definitely get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"I stopped in this rocknes on ridge road it wasnt that busy which was good for me because it was quiet for the most part the server was really good i ordered the max knife its like i giant bigmack lol i think my eyes where bigger then my stomach because i couldnt finish it but was still pretty good i recommend the mini max its still a pretty big burger you just wont dislocate your jaw trying to eat it with onion rings instead of the fries"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and today's visit was a pretty good example of how half-arsed the service can be and how everyone from the servers to the kitchen doesn't seem to really care about the quality of what they're serving.

When my boyfriend and I walked in around 3:00 this afternoon, the parking lot was pretty empty, as was the restaurant. There were no large parties, but we got the feeling that we'd missed a rush by about an hour as there were some tables pushed together in the dining room area. We waited about a minute to be acknowledged, when the hostess stood up from a booth and asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar or dining room area, sighing at the beginning and end of her sentence. We asked for the dining room and she literally sighed AGAIN,before walking us to a booth and asking us if the booth was ok - while walking away! 

Our server came by pretty quickly for drink orders (a Coke and an iced tea), and brought the drinks back with just enough time for us to decide what we wanted. He ordered the Terminator sandwich with fries and I ordered half a Southern Po' Boy and a side salad. I opted for the salad to be brought out ahead of my sandwich. It took about ten minutes for my salad, which was well assembled but wilted for the most part. Additionally, the home made croutons were just soaked with grease and sat, heavy, in the pit of my stomach.

Maybe another ten minutes and our sandwiches were brought out. The server hasn't said a word to us apart from taking our orders at this point. My boyfriend starts to dig into his sandwich and notices that all of his fries are greasy and soggy almost immediately. The coleslaw on my sandwich tasted mostly like vinegar, and I ended up scraping it off my sandwich and only eating the bottom half. The pork was really dry for pulled pork, which is sort of an accomplishment to be honest.

We got one refill on our drinks as she brought out the check which amounted to $25 before tip - which the food was definitely not worth. Given that the restaurant was not busy, there was really no excuse for the apathetic service. I heard other servers being upbeat (or rather, not dead), so it may have just been our server. But that doesn't explain why our food was pretty awful. Not all my experiences at the Kent Rockne's are as bad as this one, but they aren't that far off. The service is usually better, but the food is basically always sub par."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  What I can tell you is that the quality has gone downhill over the past few years while the prices have shot up through the roof.

Rockne's is not the place to go if you're on a diet.  Their fries looked like they were dipped in lard then thrown into a grease cooker for an hour.  Quite honestly, they were the greasiest fries I've ever had - and they also took up 3/4 of my plate.  The main dishes I've ordered here are not bad, although they also follow the motif of being extremely greasy, generally speaking.

I've never had a complaint about service or beer selection, though.  For a bar employing mostly college students, this place isn't that bad.  They're courteous and are quick to assist you.

Just remember that if you come here, expect to go shopping for new clothes soon."}
{"text":"Rockne's is good for people who grew up eating it or eating freezer food.  The food is clearly pre-cooked, reheated, and slopped together.  I don't know how so many locals like it."}
{"text":"This place was really really good!!!! The place is real chill and lowkey! Kind of has a diner type feel! My waitress was pretty nice and I didn't have to wait forever for my food! I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger w/fries! Man they give you a lot of fries I mean a lot!!!! They serve fresh-cut fries so I really enjoyed that! The burger is so soooooo good! It was just right not overlooked but not to juicy! I really enjoyed my experience! If you are craving a burger I would suggest coming here! You will really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We went to Rockne's in Strongsville unexpectedly when the restaurant we had planned to go to was closed on Monday.  Anyway, I had never been there before.  Not impressed.  I had a cup of the tortilla soup - it was luke warm and it is a very small cup.  Also ordered the half Philly sandwich - will not do that again.  It wasn't very good and no gravy to dip it in.  Not offered any refill on my soda although the server did come to our table several times.  I felt like they wanted us to leave so they could wait on others.  Probably will not go again."}
{"text":"The food on the whole was just ok. Portions were ridiculously large. Had the mini Max and was not really impressed. Fries were meh. Wifey did like the taco salad that she ordered.

Decor is sports bar-ish. The chain began near a college campus so that explains the look.

Overall this place would get 2 stars from me, but two people made the difference: Hannah and Leconde. Hannah was simply amazing as a hostess, even taking the time to entertain the kids and let the youngest actually reserve our table by showing him how. And I can not ever heap enough praise upon Leconde! He was phenomenal! Seriously, this is what customer service should be. Those two get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my boys while traveling thru Ohio and in short, decent meal with good portion sizes for a good value. I would compare this to a TGIFridays or an Applebee's. You will find TV's throughout tuned to various sport channels. Our waitress was good, but did make us feel a bit hurried, even though the place was not packed. Food came out really quick as well. I had the Chicken Alfredo, which came with a side of garlic bread. I do wish there had been a bit more chicken in it. My boys had the grilled cheese and hamburger with fries. Note that the kids burger does not come with anything on it, which was perfect for my boy. We ended our dinner with one of their mini desserts (peanut butter creme pie), which was delicious."}
{"text":"Why am I such a glutton??
Why am I easily swayed by my friends?
Why do I have TOTAL disregard for moderation?
Why oh why am I SUCH a sucker for burgers and fries????
So Rockne's has a double double burger...1 lb of meat sandwiched between 3 buns with bacon, cheese and of course tom, onion pickle...
Really quite good and killed almost all of it with a healthy dent in the fries but dear Lord!!!!
I felt like a bloated deer carcass alongside 480 in the hot sun for HOURS!!!!!
Please take my advice when going out with friends...DON'T let them dare you into eating something that is almost as big as your head!!!!"}
{"text":"I generally have consistently good meals at Rockne's ... but then again, I don't ever order anything except for The Terminator sub! It's definitely a top 5 sub sandwich in my book. Shaved prime rib, melted cheese, french fries, lettuce and a thousand-island-like sauce ... it never disappoints. The Strongsville location is relatively new, and the lounge is always a good place to stop for a beer and quick bite to eat. In the summer, the small patio off the lounge works well too."}
{"text":"We were out to lunch with the family while visiting the Stow area.  We decided to stop at Rockne's as it was near our hotel and had a large menu that would allow everyone to find their favorite.

We arrived at ~11:30 to an empty place.  Service was fast (as you'd expect with no customers).  I ordered the soup/sandwich combo.  The chicken dumpling soup arrived quickly.  It was hot and good.  The Texas Turkey Club was ok.  The food seemed like something that you could make in your own kitchen, so I wasn't overly impressed.

A family member ordered bacon cheese fries as her side.  They inadvertently made a whole appetizer order so they gave her the full order.  I sampled the bacon cheese fries....and YUM!

Their menu included mini dessert options.  They all looked very good and were reasonably priced.  I liked the concept as it allows you to try dessert without breaking the bank.  I wish we'd have had more time to try it."}
{"text":"Love Rocknes!  I used to go to the one in Kent during college and am glad they are all over Cuyahoga Falls.  If you haven't had their black bean soup, you haven't lived!  It is amazing!

I always have the Svoulaki salad with fat free hiney mustard dressing.  I dream of this salad!  Before that, it used to be the philly cheese-steak sandwich!  If anyone at the table orders fries, I pick at them because they are so freakin' good!

Full bar, great atmosphere and prices/portions that can't be beat"}
{"text":"Philly sandwich with american cheese? Why?! Waitress said this location changed the cheese awhile ago- just not the same. It was \"cheezy\"! Would not order that again from this location.

Great service"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day. It was decent. It had the tin ceilings or whatever you call them, but they casted a yellow glow on everything so it was kinda weird when you walked back outside. 

I ordered a sandwich, it was pretty good. They have coke and pepsi which was semi excited and different. I ordered a little cheese cake for dessert and that was pretty good.

Our waitress was very slow though, but otherwise the place was decent."}
{"text":"Great soup I heard, but since I love the tomato basil, I never try any others.
Good service but a little too good, you feel a tad rushed.
Food is very decent but not exceptional in ant way. Just home type cooking.  The pot roast stackers were very tasty.
Great fries and good beer selection 
Can't really think of another place close by that is better.
Warm and friendly atmosphere and clean
Give it a go!"}
{"text":"The world would be a better place without the likes of these types of restaurants. It's just tired. Typical restaurant chain, with typical chain restaurant fare. There are so many good, family-owned restaurants around town; don't bother with Rockne's."}
{"text":"I know its a chain, but it's a great alternative to the mainstream places. My Mini-Max was bigger than a Big Mac and very fresh. Makes me think this is what an original Big Mac was suppose to taste like. Also, I got way more fries than anyone should be able to eat in one sitting."}
{"text":"Rockne's has a huge menu.  The variety is exciting and the portions are big and the service is always excellent.  

We had Hector wait on us tonight, he was top notch.  

And those sauerkraut balls..  Mmmm boy!"}
{"text":"I've been getting salads from Rockne's ever since they came to Medina. I've always been pleased; however, in the past few months I've been very disappointed. Today was the worst. My \"usual\" Southwestern Salad was missing corn, broccoli, and black beans. I could count the cheese strips, and the dressing was watery. I got this for take-out, and when I phoned them to let them know, the woman who answered the phone definitely did not want to hear about it. 
Plus, there is no email listed on their web site so I can let management know how they're going downhill."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened...good times.  It was a nice addition to the Fairlawn area so many years ago!  My dad and I would stop in and get salads to go...one in particular has been on the menu since day one, it's a real \"healthy Ohio treat\"....drum role please....

THE BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD (also known as the Firestone salad)!

Now, by \"healthy\" I mean TOTALLY NOT GOOD FOR YOU SUKA!  I bet this salad has more calories than 5 Swensons galley boys but who cares it's totally freaking tasty.

This salad consists of:

A bed of warm pita bread.
A mound of iceberg lettuce.
Maybe some tomatoes...
Cheddar jack cheese.
Loads of charbroiled chicken drenched in buffalo chicken hot sauce.
Finely chopped celery topped with ranch dressing.

The trick, order extra buffalo sauce to take this salad over the top!  Well, anyway I was in town for a quick visit and made sure to stop in to get my fix...damn that was tasty.

It's buffalo wings for classy folk or if you're living in denial and believe all salads are healthy.  When you get board with the fork you can make mini pita buffalo chicken gyros that kick culinary ass!!

I give this calorie bomb of a salad 9 \"you know a salad is bad for you when it starts with a foundation of pita bread\" out of 10.

{"text":"Went to this Rockne's at 8:30 expecting the restaurant to be open until 10p as stated on their website. As we walked in the hostess rudely stated that they close at 9:30 due to summer hours \"just so we know\". Very disappointed and saddened by this horrible customer service on the Rockne's hostess part. We love Rockne's and never have had a problem in the past. Regretfully, not only did this hostess lose our business for tonight but also the future."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I really love this place. Their salads are what I compare all other salads to. Just a comfortable, casual place to grab dinner when one doesn't feel like cooking. They have something for everyone, from sandwiches (the Terminator is a favorite) to salads (the pasta salad is really good) to fried appetizers (sauerkraut balls anyone!) I really miss Rockne's!"}
{"text":"I've visited this Rockne's many times, and most of the time it's 3-4 stars, so today's 0 stars leads me to 2 overall stars.

It took a little while to get waited on after arriving around 2:30 pm, maybe 5 minutes. It took almost 30 minutes before the food arrived, and they were not at all busy. I was finished eating by 3:30 pm and finally at 3:45 had to ask the hostess to find my waitress to get my check. It was another 10 minutes to get my change. When I got out to the parking lot, there were maybe 10 total cars, including mine. Not sure what caused the problems because they were obviously not busy."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and usually am pleased with the meals and service. Fried food is their staple, yet food is often overfried, especially the french fries. Lately their fries are mostly ones with a lot of the peel. If they're fresh hand-cut as they claim, only the fries near the edge should have long strips of peel with many more fries with just the tips with the peel. Also recently, I ordered the chicken caesar salad, and the chicken was brown and part was totally burnt. It looked like the chicken had been cooked the day before and recooked for my salad. I left after a couple bites. But, more often than not I am pleased with this Rockne's."}
{"text":"I usually dine at the Rockne's in Stow. The Kent location falls far short. For a restaurant that really just specializes in fried food, you'd think they would know how to fry food. I ordered the sampler platter. One mozzarella stick was so over-fried that the cheese blew out of it and it was empty. I had a hard time telling the chicken tenders from the chicken wings. Everything was just so over-fried it was kind of shriveled. I don't eat the fried macaroni and cheese things anyway, but they were fried/stuck to each other. The restaurant was busy at noon, over half full, but still, how hard is it to not over-fry stuff?"}
{"text":"From the moment we were seated in a nearly empty restaurant in the middle of the afternoon and the waitress stopped at our table four times, literally one time after the other, asking if we were ready to order, I wondered why we had stopped there at all. We told her when she gave us the voluminous menu we had not been there in a while and would need some time to decide what we wanted. Apparently she did not hear or was on a mission.

I ordered a gyro salad which arrived with a very weird sweet creamy Italian dressing, blessedly on the side. I requested a regular Italian dressing, which also was not what I would consider a true Italian dressing. The salad consisted of iceberg lettuce, one slice of cucumber, two small tomato slices, gyro meat and some feta cheese. Not a kalamata olive in sight and I would expect a few more cucumber slices and tomato slices in a normal gyro salad. The gyro meat and feta were tasty.  This salad was over eight dollars, so they are making a handy profit on them.

We also ordered sauerkraut balls as an appetizer. They were good. 

Overall, I doubt I would ever return to this restaurant. We have other restaurants locally we like and that provide much better food. Having said that, my dining companion ordered a burger and said it was wonderful, so perhaps salads are just not their thing."}
{"text":"Soup lovers, this is the place for you! My favorite is the cheesy ham and potato. It's thick and creamy. There are plenty of potato chunks and it is topped with shredded cheddar and bacon. It is delicious. Soups are served with pita bread. I thought pita with potato soup sounded odd m, but it pairs well.

They have a large menu. I've never been disappointed here. The service is usually fast and friendly. Nothing fancy here, good food and good service. Simple as that."}
{"text":"You know what your getting when you goto Rockne's.  Its not bad, its not great, but its alright.  The best bacon cheddar fries anywhere always. Good service, cool atmosphere.  a decent place to stop."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst food I have ever been served by a restaurant. The appetizer was served still frozen in the middle, and the main course was a microwaved pasta dish. There is no excuse that would explain such a bad representation of what a meal should be. I have had better food at a gas station."}
{"text":"Voted #1 for casual dining by Beacons Best? Seriously? If that's the case there is no point in entering Akron. Ever. 

After a extensive wait our food finally arrived - unfortunately it was cold. 
The silverware was dirty.  The server visited rarely. 

The best thing about this restaurant? The Dyson Blade in the restroom. 

Truth be told, I've been to other Rocknes locations and had great food and good service. But after multiple unpleasant visits to this one, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Server was good but seemed we were a bother and, the vegetarian options have dwindled down to a veggie burger and a hummus plate. That's it. Downgrading too one star for that reason. I'll not be back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is where I go if I want a really big salad or a nice warm bowl of soup. The pita is a definite highlight of these dishes. Everything else is really greasy."}
{"text":"Decent pub grub, and lots of it!

The menu boasts pretty standard pub fare, only it comes in large quantity.  The terminator samich is a great meal for lunch, if you don't want to eat dinner.  The decor looks like what Applebee's was trying to copy in they're \"friendly neighborhood bar\" theme, yet Rockne's does it better.  Stop on in and grab a pint and a plate.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Steady decline.  Food used to be very good but now it seems bland and uninspired.  I'm not sure what they did to ruin the staple menu items,  but they succeeded.   The only thing left worth getting is the soup.   They even managed to wreck the chicken tenders!   How I miss the original in the Falls...:("}
{"text":"Wednesday at 5:00. Sat in the bar.  Extremely slow service! Ordered drinks and the server walked by them several times before bringing them over. 

The salad was good and the honey mustard dressing was outstanding. 

Would try this place again."}
{"text":"It is spot on \"average\". The portions were small. My cole slaw was lucky to be able to have a 3rd forkful attempt made.

I had the chicken tenders and they looked FAR SMALLER than how they appear on the menu. The decor is like an outdated 1990's Applebee's.

My server was polite but then took almost 15 minutes to cash me out once I was done.

While this was not a horrible experience, there is nothing that will have me return."}
{"text":"I love Rocknes. Been going here for years and it's always a great time. I usually get the mini max, which is the best burger ever. It's mouth watering goodness that leaves you wanting more after your done eating it. I've tried several other dishes and have never been disappointed. The staff is uber friendly. Especially the waitress that I had; I just wanted to give her a hug:) The atmosphere is great and family friendly. I highly recommend Rocknes of Medina. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I only wish it was closer to my home. Service is always quick and the food tasty. Prices are pretty good. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Typical all American fare with hearty portions. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish they had used romain lettuce/greens mix in the salad instead of iceberg alone. Our waitress Stephanie was top notch and I wanted to give her a shot out! She made sure that our food was out quickly, she checked on us periodically and that out drinks were refilled regularly."}
{"text":"I do not frequent Rocknes often, despite living only a few minutes away.. never that thrilled with my experiences here, but I was craving a salad and decided to give it another try last night. 
Our server, Katie was fantastic. 
However the overall experience regarding our food was an absolute train wreck. 
My Firestone chicken salad came out promptly, with undercooked(pink throughout) chicken. Katie apologized profusely and offered to remake.. great. 
33 minutes later, my mother was finished with her dinner and I was STILL waiting for my salad. Absolutely ridiculous. 
I appreciate that the server took the failure of a meal off our check, however I am vastly disappointed in the fact that no manager was to be found."}
{"text":"Yes, my mistake was going out to eat on Valentine's day and also going with a group who did not make a prior reservation (hello, group hangout to see Deadpool!). However, looking back, I should have just gone to the theater and crammed popcorn in my hungry face. I'm not even annoyed about the wait. The hosts were trying to keep a large group of people pleased, including many strangers whom SAW A CROWD and yet acted like they were the only people to think of going out to eat on Valentine's Day. 

However, once we got sat, I figured, no big deal. We all will order food, eat said food, pay for the food, and go see a great movie. There were five of us in total. Once we ordered our drinks, I'm still not sure why it took almost 20 minutes for me to get my beer. When our server took our order, she tried to leave after taking four orders - we had to stop her when she tried to walk away so she could take my sweet friend's order (I mean, my friend is skinny but not invisible). 

Once our food showed up, another friend's food wasn't even there (turns out she didn't have to pay for it either - since it was never put in. That was lousy for her). I had a salad and no silverware. After asking repeatedly for silverware from our server, we had to start asking the other servers. I was so hungry that I actually attempted to eat my salad with my fingers. Luckily, there are napkins in the dispenser on the table. My date's order was wrong (soup and salad, only the soup was wrong. At least my date got a spoon). Another friend ordered fries that looked really gross, and tasted like they had been under a heat lamp for a good 30 minutes (which they likely were). 

We requested separate checks, although that may have been a mistake. I should have just tossed the cash on the table. The checks weren't separated correctly."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since my college days in the early 90's so this place always has a nostalgic draw for me. I hate to say it seems as if recently there has been a steady decline in both  experience and food quality. The most recent visit really  hammered that point home. After being seated we finally had to get the hostess to get us a waitress after waiting awhile, then for the rest of the meal our waitress all but forgot we existed, not refilling drink orders or other normal tasks. We ordered an appetizer and it didn't come out till midway through the main meal we ordered being consumed. Considering what we ordered  even that took a long time to get to our table. I definitely willing to consider maybe they were having an off night it happens to the best of us but this is now three times in a row with poor service. It's sad I really do have very fond memories of this place, but with lackluster services there are far better and more reasonable options around Kent."}
{"text":"Food is low quality, my husband loves the place I hate it! Food is just gross. French onion soup is decent."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of corp chains.  You want fresh salads and entrees with crispy fresh fries and the results at Rocknes makes you think they make everything at corporate vendors freeze and ship so the restaurant warms and serves stale and cold without care. Yuk"}
{"text":"Rockne's is apparently a local chain, and we went to the Streetsboro location because we were staying in a close-by motel.  The seating is comfortable - many big booths.  Sports was quietly on the TVs.  The music was subdued and the noise level conversation friendly.    There is a full bar.  

I ordered the double bacon cheddar burger, and my companion ordered the Firestone chicken salad.  Both were well prepared, but the salad was a bit heavy on the iceberg lettuce and short on the vegetable aspect.   
The cheeseburger was just what was advertised - bun, 2 burgers, cheese, bacon, and bun.  No lettuce or tomato, although they would have brought them if I'd asked.  The burger and hand-cut fries were both quite tasty, largely because of the low salt levels.  I liked that very much!  Rockne's does  not over-salt their food.  I love it!

So...if you want decent food at a reasonable price, Rockne's is a good bet for you."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite of the Rockne's options - I prefer the ones in Kent and Cuyahoga Falls for atmosphere - but the food is spot-on and exactly what i want and expect from Rockne's. I've never had bad service here, and I've been coming for years."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was luke warm.
I had asked if my meall could come with no onion....server came out said my meal was being remade due to having onions on it. About 3 minutes later my food was brought out, with onions on it. We had to be someplace otherwise I would have said something."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents today for a late lunch, early dinner. Our server, Chelsea, was perfect and went the added effort to give us to go cups for our drinks along with our food. Atmosphere was good, except the loud teens in the next booth, and can tell the staff get along which makes everything more enjoyable. 

The food was good, not wonderful write home, but adequate for the price. Flavor, texture, moistness was all there. Typical good diner food.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love the food but please don't tell my sister that you put romaine lettuce in her salad and we call you and tell you it's iceberg and you still say its romaine.  Thanks for taking care of my sister on her next visit!"}
{"text":"Food was good.,

We had a family event for a new addition to our family.  We had folks in from Pittsburgh, Columbus, Clearwater, FL and Virginia Beach.  We chose Rockney's.  

BAAAD IDEA.  We were a party of 12 or 13, and they took our reservation, then seated us at different table.  We had one table for eight, and another booth across the room for the other four. 

So we asked the waitress if we could pull over the EMPTY table next to us (it was 4:00 in the afternoon and the place was empty), but she said that she could not.  So we asked the manager if we could slide the table over so that we could dine and chat and reminisce as a group.  The manager said that he was not allowed to do that (move a table a couple of feet).

My 84 year old Grandmother was seperated from grandaughter and two great-grandkids.  Not a
 friendly restaurant"}

{"text":"Normal restaurant. The burgers are great they give you a pile of fries but never get the steak its not good at all."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Rockne's for years (like over 15 years!) so it was fitting that we visited there over Christmas. Food is still good although maybe not quite what is was many years ago. This particular location was good for a group of 12 of us as they have an upper area for larger tables. My elderly parents who use a cane and walker had a hard time accessing this area. It worked out in the long run but definitely was a bit of a challenge to get them up the two sets of stairs. 

I had the Firestone salad and definitely recommend that if you're not wanting something greasy. Lots of menu items available if you are craving something a bit heavier. 

Service this night was slow but it was ok."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant while driving from Cleveland to Cincinnati.  Stopped for lunch.  Great selection of sandwiches and salads.  I was impressed that they had diet pepsi, diet coke and diet dr. pepper.  Awesome burgers!  House specialty cheesesteak wasn't bad too.  Prices were very reasonable and service was great!  

They won numerous awards."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for soup and salad, the service has been pleasant every time and the food is better than other chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Rockne's isn't anything too incredibly special, but I feel like getting steak fajitas can be either hit or miss at chain restaurants, and at Rockne's it was definitely a HIT. I've only been to the Brooklyn Rockne's once, and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The Food is good. It Has that home cooked flavor. The prices are very cheap. Most dishes, under, ten dollaah. 
The booze isn't cheap. $5.75 for a single if Chivas regal and they charged me a dollar for \"rocks\". That's one dollar for too many ice cubes. Strange. 
Otherwise, it's ok."}
{"text":"One cold and rainy night, we decided to stop here because we were miles from our destination and starving. It was about 9:30PM and it seemed like there was no other options. So, we stumbled on Rockne's and decided to give it a try. HUGE mistake, low and behold there were corporate restaurants around the corner... We had the shrimp and fries, which was definitely fried from frozen. The slides, which were disgusting. The soup and sandwich, which wasn't any better. The fries tasted like they were freezer burnt and also were very soggy. Also, the service wasn't that great. We were first seated in the bar, next to a rowdy group of teenagers. For as big as the restaurant is, why would you seat someone next to a large party? This place is far from okay."}
{"text":"When I had the chance to go out to eat as a kid, I went to too many of these types of places: sit-down restaurants that have hamburgers, sub sandwiches, with one or two dishes that feature Italian, Mexican, and 'oriental' cuisine], casual dress, often located in suburban shopping developments, have sports on TVs in the background. 
I'll admit my bias, I'm not really a fan of these type of places and Rockne's, sort of blend together with appleland [applebees], Fridays, Red Robin, fuddruckers, Champs, bennigan's, max and ermas, etc, etc.

So, for what Rockne's offers, it does all right. 
The chicken and dumplings soup was the same [Campbell's] that mom used to buy from market day. On my most recent visit, I had a gyro that tasted fine. FYI: The Rockne's Sauce (not sure what it's called) on the burgers is the sort of thousand-island based sauce similar to McDonald's. Priced reasonable, menu items under $15. 

If you're looking for a typical, Americana restaurant, Rockne's does a good job at it without being a chain. However, if you have any sense of adventure for food, you'll probably want to head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very large menu with lots of great food. Attentive staff and cold beer. Great combination"}
{"text":"We decided to stop for a bit at this Rockne's location after doing some shopping at Aurora Farms (our first time at any Rockne's).  Right off the bat, this place looks and feels very 'old school', with it's ancient high back wooden booths, train station tile floor, and RMS Titanic decor ceilings.  Which isn't necessarily bad, but the place did look a bit dated to be honest.  My main issue with Rockne's is that most of the food here is deep fried and tastes really gross.  There are some exceptions such as their tasty salads and the excellent Texas Toast turkey sandwich I had, but for the most part, there is more grease and oil in the deep fried food here than is in all the NE Ohio Lube Stops combined!  My onion rings were often soggy inside (but crunchy on the outside), and with each bite I felt cooking oil all over my mouth and palate.  My kid's chicken strips probably contained a quart of oil.  Unless they start including more food that is not fried, we won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"We go there almost every Sunday, we tip well, and sit at the same table every time. We asked for the same table. Hostess was rude and refused. Said we'd have to sit out on the patio. It's hot and muggy, and we said no. Well, they chose to stand by their idiotic decision, and in the process, lost us as customers...probably forever!!!"}
{"text":"My son decided he wanted Rockne's for his 15th birthday celebration. We had a party of 10, so I called ahead since they don't typically take reservations. They were awesome and had the table ready for us when we arrived. Everyone that helped us was so kind. They held our cake in back so it wasn't in our way. Our appetizers came out quickly and disappeared before I could get a picture. We had a sampler, the deep fried green beans, cheese sticks and macaroni bites. All were really good. I would have been happy to just have the green beans & macaroni bites alone. I had the oriental salad which was amazing. I think I could have that at least 5 days a week! My husband had the cheeseburger which he really enjoyed. My daughter loved her fettuccine and my son's shrimp was very good! So crispy and perfectly cooked. Both the mushroom Brie & French onions soups were very good. We hadn't been to Rockne's in years even though they're right around the corner. I'm sure we'll be back more often now. Everything was really good!!"}
{"text":"Visited today for a business lunch with a colleague. Service was great, fast and food was hot and delicious. I would recommend the cuban black bean soup and turkey club. I've heard their reuben is good but haven't had it myself. Colleague was very happy with their food too."}
{"text":"If you're from Akron you know rocknes... I and everybody I know have eaten here our entire lives and loved it. It is a Akron legend. Sadly in the past six months or so, they've changed their recipe for their famous Italian salad dressing. It is absolutely horrible. It taste water down with practically no flavor. I've tried several Rockne's locations, they've mostly all switched to the new terrible version. The only positive is the Rockne's on Merriman still serves the original. I will never go back to any of the newer locations ever again. UNLESS they go back to the original! It's literally the only reason to go to Rocknes, and they screwed it up!"}

I was kind of excited to go here as we went several years ago. But....meh. I had a Philly sandwich.. a steak and cheese that was basically flovorless. On another note....the beer was cold. My wife had a salad. All told it ( the meal) didn't suck; but should THAT be the standard for a nice meal out?"}
{"text":"Left thinking...Ballot stuffing confirmed after this dinner?

This place advertises many voted 1st or 2nd items in the area... this cant be true. 

For starters the host asks how many in our party.. turns to get menus, immediately turns back around and asks you said 2 right? 

The ceiling is very low.. even the outside window fixtures are too low...

We had to ask for our refills...but the lemonade is fantastic. 

The fries were cold

The hamburger was terrible. .very greasy..the bun was soaked..

The chicken strips were very thin..

The manager at least walked through asking everyone how their meal was..

Doesnt live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Stopped back in after shopping, it was about 8:45pm. Walked in, 4 gals at the hostess stand, only ONE of them was remotely friendly! Got seated immediately. Server, she was not very friendly, seemed to be in a hurry.
We ordered to entrees, and two sodas. 
Waitress, delivered our food but was far more concerned about her side work she had to get done so she can leave. Never refilled our drinks, and was again doing her side work all around us. 
I get it was one hour till close, and I don't blame her for wanting to get out of work, but being a server, and you work off tips basically, to get a good tip, that's not the way to do it! 
Oh the food was good though!"}

{"text":"It's all about the Rockne's number one salad. That dressing that chicken the pita bread, Yum! I'm not sure what else is on the menu but usually I'm a little disappointed if I don't get that salad. It's their number one salad the Firestone."}
{"text":"Service here is always excellent. They do a great jon hiring their servers. Food is good except their chicken fingers and they do not melt the cheese on their french onion soup which is a no, no for me. 
Its a nice family restaurant. Excellent menu choices. I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant because we were from out of town and wanted to try something new. That was a mistake. The waitress deserves five stars because she was great, but the food was just sad and the restaurant was dirty. When your shoes stick to the floor that's the first sign. When you use the restroom and the doors are sticky that's another sign. The food was definitely frozen and it came out almost directly after ordering which made me wonder how long it was sitting out. There was not a single fresh factor anywhere. I should have just made food at home. Our chicken sandwich just gushed with grease to the point that it was sliding out of the bun. Needless to say we did not finish and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always pretty good. No issues. Like the pick two. Great for lunch or dinner. Loved the fish sandwich. Could not find a better one anywhere. Steady, no curve balls."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Came here for a carry out order. I ordered chicken quesadillas. They were mushy and soggy. The staff was very friendly and prompt, but the food isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Rocknes's rarely disappoints.  A casual, reasonably priced eatery.  The menu is fairly expansive, the food always good, and the service is rarely underpar even when they are slammed.  Lunch and dinner only.  I had a very nice fruit plate, my companion had a cheeseburger and at my urging, fries.  Their fries almost merit a review of their own!  Always hand-cut, fresh properly cooked in peanut oil, they are rarely included with your entree, but pony up or miss the best part of the meal.  My service benchmark is my iced tea glass.  When I'm thirsty as I was at this occasion, I want tea in it, not air.  Our waitress must have filled my glass a half dozen times cheerfully and in a very timely manner.  That will alway put you in 20% or better range waitstaff out there so pay attention!  Many restaurants brag about their 1/3 lb. burgers these guys offer a ONE POUNDER..for less than ten bucks!!  If in doubt order it split it with your companion with a single order of fries and if so inclined flesh it out with salad or their homemade soups. Chicken dumpling and black bean are my favorites.  Rock on Rocknes!"}
{"text":"We went to Rockne's this weekend with a group of 13 including 4 children. Before I go into reviewing our dinner, I just want to mention that even when you park the car in the giant lot, you are immediately hit with the delicious smell coming from the restaurant! 

Our group seated in the new enclosed patio. We were seated fairly quickly for a large group on a Saturday night. Our waitress was FANTASTIC! She got every special request correct, refilled everything quickly, and really catered to our group. 

Our favorite menu pick is the Terminator Sub with Extra Crispy Fries (special request)."}
{"text":"I've dined at this Rockne's on several occasions recently and the service and food are very good.

We ordered potstickers as an appetizer and they were delicious. The Asian sauce and soft, tasty exterior made them a welcome addition to my meal. For dinner, I ordered the southwest salad, which was yummy. The grilled chicken breast that it included was cooked well, was tender, and delicious.

With a good selection of beer and wine, everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Rockne's with the wife for lunch recently.  She ordered a chicken sandwich and I ordered the fajita bowl with a side of white chicken chili.

I absolutely love the chili.  It has a nice spicy kick, which I crave.  The fajita bowl was tasty, of great quality, and extremely filling.  After the chili, I couldn't finish the fajita bowl.

Once again, the service was excellent.  I'll keep coming back to their tasty and diverse menu!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Stow roughly two years ago and preferred this location to that of Kent's. The staff here is a little more friendly, the congestion was next to nothing and the food seemed fresher. 

But..and there's always a \"but\"; (go figure) after I finished my basket of fries I had put my glasses back on so I could read the receipt and noticed a bunch of nasty gnats all over the wall above me. Our waitress heard me say something to my boyfriend and saw me taking pics (can't figure out how to post pics on here but if you contact me I'll gladly email it to you) of their wall but never bothered to ask if everything was okay. I realize she might have been embarrassed but if I was her, I would've gone to the manager and asked that the meal be free or for them to come out and speak with the table. To me, ignoring a bug infestation is just bad customer service & makes me really question the cleanliness of this Rockne's location :/"}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great, but not bad. 
---
Came here as an early afternoon lunch option. 
1. \"cherry coke\" - here, it's Coke with grenadine. A bit too sweet / medicinal
2. Pita bread with house Italian: it's this place's specialty, and did not disappoint. Who knew the two would be a good pairing as a starter?
3. Reuben: average. The coleslaw in a tortilla shell was a creative touch, though unnecessary. 
4. Veggie quesadilla with a side of refried beans: ditto. Here too, they unnecessarily served salsa and sour cream in tortilla shells.  
5. Burger: also average
6. Mushroom bisque with Brie: suspicious for undertones of Campbell's mushroom soup

Not a bad place. No idea why, but it reminds me a bit like Houlihan's."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a quick dinner while on a business trip, the parking lot was full which is a good sign that they have good food. I had the tomato bisque which had good flavor but was a bit crunchy for a soup if you ask me. The fries were good but the piled the sandwich on top so all of the lettuce and other stuff made them soggy. The sandwich lacked meat but had plenty of cheese, I would have preferred a better balance. Overall it had good flavor I just wish it was presented differently. 
While I was there I sat at the bar and an older guy maybe the manager was mixing a drink and spilled it. In his frustration he wiped the cup back and just about have me a shower of whatever he was making. I understood his frustration but he needs to be aware of his surroundings. I would have said something but I didn't want to come off like I was trying to get a free meal.
The inside was nice and very modern and clean. I had an iced tea, soup sandwich and fries and it was $12+, overall I don't think the food was good enough to deserve a second trip."}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre, but you get a lot of food.

It's up to you to decide if that's what you want, but on a budget you will get two meals here and I've yet to have a truly terrible meal. Just don't expect it to amaze you."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food great service no vaping like over at the happy moose down the street. What more could one ask for?  My waitress has been by 3 times to ask how I'm doing. Keep it up Rocknes I tip big for good service. Definitely my recommendation if you're looking for good food. The lady at my hotel said its a local chain. If they had them in Michigan this would be my spot. And a great value."}
{"text":"I went here to lunch recently.  I had the turkey club with fries.  Rockne's fries are great with malt vinegar.  In my opinion almost everything at Rockne's is good.  The portions are usually quite generous and the prices are reasonable.  On this visit the service was okay.  The dude was running around like crazy and I had to wait a bit to get my check and get out the door."}
{"text":"My niece and I went there last night for dinner when the wait at Texas Roadhouse was too long.  The hostess was very friendly and we were seated right away, but it took over an hour for our food to arrive.  We not given silverware nor any plates with our appetizer.  It was very busy but our waiter never came and asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks, but he did visit the table behind us several times.  We had ordered an item to go when we placed our meal order, but it also took a long time after we finished our meal.  Next time I think we will wait at Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Geez this place was PACKED for lunch.  However, our sandwiches came out in about 7 minutes.  It wasn't a superb outing, but got the job down.  Food mouth stomach happy.

Great corporate service. They deserve their flair."}
{"text":"First time I visited, in town for work, enjoyed the crock of French Onion Soup as well as I believe it was called the \"Terminator\" or something like that, a Cheesesteak.  Both were really good, really good.  A nice surprise in a place set up like an Applebee's or any of other similarly styled places.  Pretty empty mid-day but I really enjoyed it.  The Terminator was one of the better Cheese Steaks I've had in a while, and I eat around quite a bit."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I haven't ate here in a while because the last time I ate here I ordered to go as I did today and I ordered their used to be premier sandwich the Terminator and It was the most terrible cut of meat. They might is well have used steak em it would have tasted better . No seasoning I don't know what happened to this restaurant it used to be so good now it's just terrible. The only thing they have going is it's clean and the staff is very friendly but the food is for a geriatric unit no seasoning taste like nothing. The soups are still good but their sandwiches terrible . Last time me and coworker had the BLT awful. So by further do I'm gonna wait 3 years then I'll try Rocknes again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has managed to win best diner for 5 years in a row. It was just ok, at best.  The restaurant itself is cute and clean.  Tv's playing sports all over the place and the waitress was attentive BEFORE we ordered.  I ordered a grilled cheese for $7.   What I got was soggy toast with melted cheese.  The sandwich was served in so much pickle juice that half of the sandwich was soggy. Gross! I thought $7 was a little ridiculous for a grilled cheese and a pickle. My friend ordered the gyro and fries.  The fries are very thin and half of those were soaked in pickle juice. The gyro meat was good flavor but was dumped on top of the veggies so you couldn't taste them.  The tzatziki sauce tasted like sour cream and there was barely any on the pita.   The pita was at least fresh and tasted good.  Our waitress never came to ask how our meal was and when she brought the bills she said she'd return with refills and never did.  Needless to say I wont be returning to Rocknes."}
{"text":"It's good/OK.  My first visit back in 10 years. Everything seemed average. 3 of us arrived at 3pm we had the place to ourselves. Service was prompt and friendly. Food arrived within 15 minutes. Fries were fresh cut, not super hot but just warm. Squeeze ketchup bottle empty (not a big deal) Bacon cheeseburger arrived without the bacon but was delivered minutes later on a side plate. Companion ordered veggie burger, disappointed , no flavor and bland (frozen patty?) Rueben was decent. Small portion of slaw served in a crispy tortilla bowl? Cute. That didn't make sense and I guess most tortilla bowls go uneaten. My tastes have evolved over the years and this is average food. #Sysco"}
{"text":"As most chains go, this one is no different.  Although, this particular Rocknes is not as good as others.  Good service is hit or miss.  I've had both and usually to the extremes.  Service is either really great or really horrible.  Yes, I've talked to the manager on one occasion for just plain lack of it!

Food is the same way and usually follows the service.  Really great or really bad.  I normally order from their salad menu.  The Gyro Salad is my favorite by far.  My children normally order the chicken fingers basket.  I am disappointed that at this particular Rockne's, that their fruit always tastes bad, so my kids are stuck with fries instead.  Their beverages are ok as well.  Anything from the bar is better that the hit or miss of soda.  I usually get the fresh lemonade for my boys and I get iced tea.

Lunch is better than dinner."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this Rockne's.  I used to go here as a student at KSU and now I bring my family here on occasion.  Good kids meal, boosters and high chairs available.  Roomy seating and a large menu that can change to order."}
{"text":"Our meal was ridiculously good and very modestly priced.  Sat in the bar due to a long wait."}
{"text":"Typical assembly line chain restaurant in the same genre as Applebee's, TGI Friday's, etc.  Has a huge menu of soups, sandwiches, burgers and wraps. The menu is so huge, it's hard to believe that any one item can be truly good. However, I've found the soups to be very good compared to the competition for what it's worth. In fact, the entire menu is a bit tastier than the competition I mentioned. 

So you won't be disappointed if you keep what Rockne's is in perspective."}
{"text":"Passing through between DC and Chicago, and this is a local favorite in the Northern Ohio area.

The layout is very strange as well, when you enter it splits into two, and the left side (the restaurant part) has 2 levels and very covered booths, which can be nice, but hard for looking for someone.

It was alright--their salads are pretty big, but it wasn't too much substance... I got the Rockne's Salad. Basically iceberg lettuce with some tomatoes (i didn't want bacon bites and I asked for cheese on the side)... I wasn't very impressed, but there aren't many healthy options and the salads don't have much option for veggies/fruits!! I asked for the cheese on the side and I got practically 1.5 cups of it...good thing I asked for it on the side! It came with a tonnn of pita bread, and it wasn't particularly delicious either, dry, hard and cold, pretty sure not made in-house.

The service was very good, our server was nice, and the speed of service was pretty good, too. I wasn't very impressed with the food, though."}
{"text":"Really quiet atmosphere which I wasn't expecting but did like. We were seated real fast, our server made sure our water was refilled regularly and our food came out super fast. The chicken tortilla soup has broccoli in it which is weird but it still tastes good. The only downside was we waited about 20 minutes for our check."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation from co-workers because I'm not from the area. I have to say this place does have great burgers, fries and soups especially the chicken dumpling and white chicken chili. Service is fast and friendly. 

BUT I ordered a side Caesar salad and boy was I shocked. It wasn't the traditional Caesar salad I recognized- it was just iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, parmesan cheese and Caesar dressing. I was thrown off...where are the croutons? why the tomatoes and no romaine lettuce? All I have to say if you can't call a salad a Caesar salad it should be a Caesar salad, if not just let me know all you have is a garden salad.  And this is why I can't give this place the 4 stars i think it deserves.

Also, for some reason my big heavy purse unlocked the stall lock which makes it super easy for other ladies and children to open the door so ladies beware. This bathroom is SUPER small and for a restaurant this size it's surprising."}
{"text":"Ah, I love Rockne's.

I would say I love it for the variety, but I only ever get one of three things...the pasta salad, the french onion soup, or the mushroom bisque.  They are soooooo gooooooood!  I have been to a bunch of the area Rockne's, but I probably end up ordering from the Fairlawn location the most since it is closest to my workplace.  We get lunch here at least once a week and have never had bad service."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. And the food was ok. We live nearby and have wanted to eat here. We both had the Gyro salad. The salad was good but not great. We didn't get any true salad dressing but rather the sauce for a gyro. I wouldn't get this salad again."}
{"text":"Truly shocked I haven't reviewed this gem yet, as it is one of my favorite and go-to restaurants, for sure. I can say with full confidence and certainty that everyone that has ever joined me on the Rockne's adventure has been impressed, if not fallen in love.

I am a Bacon Cheddar fries fanatic. Those fresh cut fair style fries with gooey cheese and bacon crumbles on top.. served with sour cream. Sheesh. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. And I know what you're thinking... yeah, cheesy bacon fries.. who doesn't have those? What's so special about theirs? Well... they just are, amigos. It's a try it yourself type of thing. Nommmm. The fresh cut aren't really fat or too thin. Your middle ground size fry. The cheese is a melted shredded Monterey Jack if I had to lay a bet. And the bacon is nice legit yummy bacon. Who can resist?

I can vouch for many of their sandwiches and many of their soups but my two favorites and automatic choices are Cheddar and Potato soup and The Firestone Salad. Their dressing (house Italian) is UN.REAL. Salads are served with warm pita and dunking them into the dressing is an absolute must. :P

Rockne's has alcohol, a sports bar feel but also a family feel, a fun interior with tinted windows... they sure do know how to trick you on how it looks outside lol. But it's a romping good time and I highly suggest you check it out. Streetsboro has been my favorite location as of yet. Super consistent with the epic deliciousness."}
{"text":"I agree with Paul S. The menu is tired and there wasn't a lot that stood out or appealed to me. I was surprised there were not any mixed drinks on the menu, so I guess it was more of a family place than I expected. I visited at least a year ago and have not been back. Was not impressed with the food or restaurant."}
{"text":"Ssrvice great. Wait time minimal. Food delish! Clean cozy. Only complaint, man sitting behind me bathed in cologne and would not stop talking. I felt bad for his date. Most of his food from when he was flapping his jaws flew into her large beehive hairstyle. Eh?snack for later perhaps."}
{"text":"Rockne's is one of the many places I miss from Cleveland!!  I had not been to this location yet but after visiting, I'm pretty sure I have now been to all the Rockne's!!  I have always had great service at every location and have tried most of their menu over the years.  The only item that I really didn't like were their Gyro's but everything else is delish!!!  My favorite dishes are the Pasta Salad (try it, you'll like it) and the Mini Max burger...yum!!"}
{"text":"Rockne's is on my must visit list every time I come up!!  Their pasta salad, Max the Knife, and their fries are my all time favs.  I have a hard time choosing!!  Be sure to get a side of the BBQ sauce - it is sweet and delish.

This chain has a few locations around NE Ohio but this one is super convenient right off of route 8.  Definitely stop in if you are looking for a tasty meal that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"From the outside, Rockne's looks like a typical Shenanigans. Inside is a bit nicer and cozier though.  This was my second trip to Rockne's and I came back just for the mushroom brie bisque. It is so delicious, with chunks of mushrooms and garlic. It is very filling too. I love that their soup is served with warm pita. I also decided to be fat and ordered their cheese fries. They are fresh cut, so points for that. A bit greasy though. Service has been good both times with very nice waiters."}
