{"text":"Simple and good. Asian desserts tend to be relatively mild, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"As a Korean, it's hard to swallow this Japanese business name, but here we are in Canada, where everyone shares cultures.  We call \"taiyaki\" boong-uh-bbang, or goldfish cake.  Kevin's Taiyaki is located inside the PAT Supermarket on the corner of Bloor and Manning.  Goldfish cake can be made from butter-batter or egg-batter. The butter kind is yummier, but heart-attack-ier. The filling options are red bean, black bean, or green bean. There is no fish in a fish cake! They just look like fish.  If you're lucky, you can buy a fish cake right as they're coming off the grill. I use this as bait/reward to get Boyfriend to come grocery shopping with me. We walk home with our bikes loaded up with groceries, taking turns on having bites of the yummy fish.  It's crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, oozing with delicious sweet bean paste.  My main complaint is that their hours are not rigid. The PAT website publishes the hours that are posted in the Yelp profile, but after having spoken to the proprietor, they say that they leave when it gets quiet at the end of the day. Be prepared to be disappointed if you go late on a slow day.  Totally unrelated but cute fact: When you see a child and parent who look very much alike, we say that the child is a goldfish cake of the parent. You know, because they were made from the same mold!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the smell of the taiyaki as soon as you enter the PAT supermarket.  What I loved about it most was that it was a light and sweet snack - the grilled batter is not all that sweet, but the filling is, and they interact to make a chewy and crunchy, hot treat for the cold winter.  Definitely worth a try, the custard's my favourite!"}
{"text":"Ordered the custard and the red bean.... yum. Bigger than I thought. Really liked the custard, would probably pass on the red bean next time but perhaps I was just too stuffed with my lunch to completely enjoy it."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Be sure to ask for a freshly made one if you want to experience Korean climax."}
{"text":"This little booth is located inside a supermarket, on the left side right when you walk in. Its VERY cheap for a taiyaki and they have the classic flavours. Its $2 or less for a taiyaki. The flavour we wanted was not ready yet and they said we could wait 15 mins, so we did. We got a fresh taiyaki and it was so delicious!!! I really cannot rate this place any better as the staff was also SO friendly. Would def come back here if i wanted a snack and I was in the area."}
{"text":"Kevin's Taiyaki is such a special treat I look forward to every time I come to Toronto. Full of warm custard, black bean, red bean, or green bean, these delicious fish-shaped waffles are just wonderful! The small stall is located in the P.A.T Mart and is on the left when you walk in."}
{"text":"For those who aren't familiar with this area, Kevin's Taiyaki is actually a tiny little store INSIDE the P.A.T. grocery mart. Totally not visible from the streets so it's very easy to miss (as I had)!  I tried a custard taiyaki and flavour-wise, it was really delicious! They put just the right amount of custard so it wasn't overly sweet or filling, but still gave the impression that it was a generous amount. The batter was also very well done. It was lightly crisped to a soft crunch on the outside and had a more moist texture near the center.    My only problem was that I was given one that was cold. I really wished for one that was piping hot straight from the grills so I was fairly disappointed in the one that I got. The girl who worked there also didn't seem very friendly so I felt like I would be a nuisance to ask for another one.   Regardless, even though mine was cold, it was still a great taiyaki. I just know that it would've been BETTER had mine been hot."}
{"text":"Kevin's Taiyaki has always been consistent and an amazing treat for me. The taiyaki is freshly made with a delicious selection of flavours (red bean, custard, green bean, and black bean). I opt for the red bean and custard and they have never failed me!"}
{"text":"I have tried taiyaki at several places.  Kevin's Taiyaki is by far THE BEST.  They have custard, red bean, and black bean.  They take the time to make them not only taste great look pretty as they trim the remnants of crispy bits off the  fish before they sell them.  I was always a red or black bean fan but tried the custard and that is equally tasty.  Always drop by if you/re in the hood.  Buy some groceries from PAT and get your taiyaki treat on the way in or out!"}
{"text":"These fish waffles are awesome. Whenever I walk by Pat's supermarket, I'm always telling whoever I'm with how good the fish waffles are.   I really like the red bean and black bean ones. The green bean and custard are good too. You really can't go wrong!! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and gooey with a touch of sweetness on the inside. Such a great winter (and even summer) snack."}
{"text":"It's my first time buying taiyaki so I won't say if it's good or not comparing to other places.... The guy who's supposed to be selling the taiyaki was on break so I just had to put the into a box myself XD the taiyakis were still warm and crispy when I got there, and all I had to do was heat it back at home and it was great (for me)  Will be going more often now :D  Price change, taiyaki is now 6.99 for 5"}
{"text":"This place is a small stall located inside PAT Mart and is almost always operated by friendly ajummas. There are 4 flavours: custard, red bean, black bean, and green bean. They say red bean is the most popular but custard is and will always be my thing. They offer discounts if you buy a combo of their taiyaki. It gets confusing with the pricing but peep my photo for the prices.  All in all, taiyaki is a popular snack in South Korea and I always get me some taiyaki whenever I'm in South Koreatown. It reminds me of some good times I had in Seoul when I was still in school.  One thing I need to know is where in the world is Kevin of Kevin's Taiyaki??"}
{"text":"Green bean is bleh. Black bean is great, as is the custard and red bean. Great texture and a nice, light flavour.  Will come back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had Taiyaki in Japan and Korea before, so I was excited to try it here.  It was good but I thought the dough tasted too much like egg and it could have been a lot fluffier.   I would say the taiyaki here is not bad but could be better. If you've never had it before you would probably like it. But personally, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I always get a fish waffle whenever I'm in the area. I got the custard waffle this time and it's crunchy and crispy like usual, though slightly undercooked this time. Maybe I was craving something super sweet, but I wanted mine with more sugar"}
{"text":"Much better than Kevin's Kayaks (which sells boats), Kevin's Thai Yaks, which sells Yaks (poor animals), and Kevin's Type-2 Diabetes, which he probably got from eating too many of his own fish-shaped waffle-like custard desserts.  What to get: A Fish-Shaped Waffle-Like Custard Dessert. Why: Because it's freaking amazing, is why, silly. Does it taste like Fish: No. What does it taste like: Custard. Waffles. Heaven. Are you sure it doesn't taste like Fish: I can't with you.  Owned by Kevin Costner, Kevin Federline, Kevin Bacon and Kevin Spacey.  Inside an awesome Korean grocery store, near the front, to the left as you walk in, is this little stand selling amazing dessert treats. They are similar to waffles, shaped like fish, and taste of custard on the inside. They are warm and delicious. I have no idea what exactly they are or why Americans and Canadians don't really have them, but I am very lucky to have discovered them, and if you are in Toronto, so should you.  They're good enough to go out of your way for. So after you have that amazing Banh Mi from Banh Mi Boys, the best dumplings on the planet (literally) at Dumpling House on Spadina, and the amazing Pork Bone Soup from Seor across the street from there, as well as more good dumplings at Yummy Yummy... you need to get up to Bloor for dessert. You can probably knock back quite a few of these, but if you have too many of them, don't drive, or you may end up in Custardy.  One of the best hidden gems in all of Canada. Try it and then tell me I was wrong.  Actually don't, because if you do, you'll be wrong that I was wrong.  Also they don't Costner much at all.  My ex gf said she refused to eat any sort of Asian desserts so I just Federline about how this wasn't really Asian, and it worked out.  However they don't sell Bacon.  Sorry I feel a bit Spacey today."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch or after work snack. Choices are either custard, red bean, green bean and black bean. Red bean is usually my favorite."}
{"text":"The best fish waffle EVERR! Please do yourself a favour and get the custard one. Please. Its sooo good! The waffles are always hot and fresh and cooked to perfection. So crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside. Mmmmmmm. Everytime I go to PAT for groceries there is no doubt I will get one of these. :D"}
{"text":"Located insider a Korean grocery store. Stall is very small but the taiyaki is pretty good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Custard is a must get - sweetness is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Kevin's Taiyaki is located inside a Korean grocery store. They're made fresh daily, and it is well worth the money.   The shell is crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with a sweet red bean filling.  You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"OMG this is the best taiyaki I have ever had! Trust me, I have had one from Galleria (duh), numerous times in Korea (my favorite winter street food) , and twice in Tokyo. You wish you would have seen my reaction after I had the first bite. I was already full from dinner.   I don't know how they make the batter and the fillings, but wow good for them. They are so generous with fillings too. Good thing I live far from here otherwise I would be grabbing these babies every day.   Just give this place a try (it is inside the PAT store). I recommend getting freshly made ones. They tend to make ahead and let them sit in the cabinet."}
{"text":"Amazing taiyakis from here! It's located just inside of PAT supermarket, once you go inside, make a left immediately, and you'll see the stall. There's a few choices of fillings and I went with custard and red bean, for $2.5 and $2.25 respectively. Both were fresh off the mould and were still warm, even though we went on a weekday at nearly 9pm. The outside was crispy while the entire was still soft and the fillings were still quite hot. Personally, I found the custard better than the red bean, as the latter was a bit too sweet and the texture of the custard worked better with the crispy outer shell of the taiyaki in my opinion. However, both were absolutely delicious for amazing prices. Definitely worth returning to and well worth a visit for those of you who haven't been!"}
{"text":"It's INISDE P.A.T. to your left when you enter (had some trouble finding this place)  There is a choice of 4 flavours: red bean, black bean, green bean and custard. When I went at 9pm the only choices left were red bean and custard. The custard being the most expensive is still only at $2 each. You do get volume discounts if you buy more!  The custard fish was tasty! It was piping hot, crispy on the outside with ooey gooey custardy doughy goodness on the inside. The perfect end to a dinner in Ktown."}
{"text":"I've gone here plenty of times when I just wanted a little snack. I really like the custard taiyaki but the red bean is good too. I know they have some other flavours too, but I've never tried them and so I can't really speak for those.   They're about $2 each and finish pretty fast so I recommend buying 2."}
{"text":"Cash only! It's pretty good. I've had it in Korea, and the taste is pretty similar. The custard fish are my favorite from here, but the red bean is nice too. I guess I would compare it to a crispy Boston cream donut without the chocolate on top. I wanted to try the other flavors, but I didn't get the chance."}
{"text":"Hmm delicious! I was lucky and got them right after they were cooked. Tried all the flavours. My personal favourite is the custard, so smooth and creamy! My friend liked the black bean because it wasn't as sweet. The waffle containing the filling was crispy but soft on the inside. It was really hard to stop eating them~"}
{"text":"These fish cakes are amazing. You must try them. Red bean is the best one. 2 dollars on each. I get them everytime? when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! There are no other words. It's so good! I wish this existed in my city. I will definitely be back for more the next time I'm in Toronto.  We tried the red bean paste taiyaki which is purely fantastic. Sweet and tasty. We also tried the custard one for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. I thought nothing would compare to the red bean paste but custard is definitely way up there on the delicious scale. As I'm typing this, my mouth is watering for more."}
{"text":"These little fish-shaped waffle-like treats are so good, you will ALWAYS have room for one (or two!) My favs are the classic red bean and their newest flavour: custard. Sweet but not too sweet, crispy outside but soft and gooey inside. Waffle-like but 10000000x better than a waffle. Pro tip: ask the vendor to make you a fresh one for maximum crispy tastiness."}
{"text":"Never actually had these before because normally it's filled with red bean which I'm not a big fan of. We tried the custard one. It is really fresh and tastes quite good. It's not overly sweet and the pastry itself is very chewy and warm! If I'm back in Korea Town, I'll definetely pick another one up. Maybe try the red bean flavour since it's the traditional one :)   This place is literally just to the left of the doors into the super market. Not exactly hidden per se but... hard to find initially if you don't look for the poster. :) It's a very very very small little corner but you can see them making the taiyaki fresh from the window!"}
{"text":"Can we all agree on the FACT that Kevin's Taiyaki is legit the best taiyaki in town, perhaps even the best taiyaki ever?! Crazy how one would find the best freshly made dessert in the corner of a Korean grocery store, but it's true! If you haven't tried it you are completely missing out. I think the reason they taste so good is 100% bc of the batter...the batter of Kevin's taiyaki is crunchy on the outside, like the texture of a fried Korean pancake, slightly sweetened, and with an al dente, grilled mochi texture. The Cream filling is my fav btw - cannot get enough of them! . . . Nom factor - 5/5 Price - 1 for $2, 5 for $9 for bean flavours (green, red, black bean) OR 1 for $2.25, 5 for $10.50 for custard Service - 4/5"}
{"text":"Cute sweet korean treats!! Looks and shape like a fish filled with different!  love their red bean paste filled waffle. It super soft from the inside and great tasting as well from the outside.. A tiny place located inside the Korean market and Price is affordable too."}
{"text":"Located in the front of the PAT supermarket, it's a tiny stall that basically sells fish waffles with various sweet fillings: 1.50-1.75 each  Red Bean Black Bean (which has black sesame in it too) Green Bean Custard (new)  I liked the custard filling. The batter isn't that thick, so I don't think it's terribly unhealthy.  Good luck resisting temptation after you smell these on your way in to PAT.."}
{"text":"Got one custard and one green bean from this small stall inside PAT Mart.   The green bean paste tastes very natural, not much add-ins that would've taken away the green bean flavour. Although it is slightly too sweet for me, just personal preference.   The custard is freshly out from the pan, hot and tasty! Not too sweet compared to other places I've tried.   Overall the fish pancake texture is perfect, reminds me the authentic egg waffle I had in HK! Crispy on the outside, chewy the inside! Love't!   Definitely will return for the black bean one!! (Which is my fav, but didn't see it until I bought the green bean, which is my 2nd fav)"}
{"text":"Looooveeeee  Everytime my friends and I are in Koreatown getting taiyaki from here is a MUST! My favourite flavour has got to be the custard one out of all of them, but red bean is really good too! Every time i got the taiyaki it  was nice and warm which made it taste 292402384 better :)   I have never tried the green and black bean one but im sure they taste just as good as the red bean and custard! All in all a really great place to get some really delicious taiyaki :D"}
{"text":"Please eat here at least once in your life. Please.  I feel like crying every time I think about Kevin's Taiyaki. Crying because I don't live close enough to eat here everyday. It's a sweet, compact snack that warms up my hands on cold evenings and, more importantly, warms up my cold, cold heart. I've tried the red bean and green bean flavours, and I must admit the red bean one tastes a smidgen better.   His little shop is inside the Korean mart and tucked away in the corner. Watching him make the taiyaki is very exciting- he puts neat little rolls inside ooey-gooey batter and waits for it to become fragrant, perfect pieces of doughy fish. It's definitely a treat to eat his taiyaki! There's no where to eat inside, so you just have to stroll down the roads of Koreatown with your delicious dessert in your hands, making everyone within a 3 meter radius drool from the fantastic scent."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem in the inside of the PAT supermarket in KTown long ago. Don't really like any other sweet pastry in KTown other than Kevin's taiyaki.   Absolutely love the black bean one. It is always perfect. Crispy on the outside and full of flavour when you bite into it.   It was packed on a Saturday night. No one knew where to line up but I got my box of taiyaki. I don't live close by so when I get a chance to get some, I get a few. It's so good fresh, but you can also re-toast it and it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"Random stall inside a korean supermarket runned by korean aunties. They make these buttery, soft, yet crispy on the edges...fishes. I prefer to the custard to the bean pastes.   Its very tasty and for $1.75 to $2.00 a fish, its a pretty good deal (though I remember coming here many years ago and it was $1.25)   I come here every so often when im in the neighborhood. Would recommend to all."}
{"text":"My goodness ... can it be that these were even better than 2 years ago?  Maybe its just because I have not had them for so long that I appreciate them more!!  Perfect and I mean PERFECT texture, slightly chewy --- and packed FULL of red-bean (p'at).  Close your eyes, eat one ... and all your problems are temporarily solved and the world is a good place."}
{"text":"It's a small stall located inside P.A.T Mart. They sell 4 different flavours of fish cakes, red bean, green bean, black bean and custard. They are crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. I often get the custard because I think it tastes the best. I usually avoid getting the bean flavoured ones as I do not like the chalky texture. The fish cakes are usually fresh, they have some on display if you want to grab something quick and go. But if you don't mind waiting, you can ask them to make you fresher ones. Fresh hot ones usually take 5-10minutes. The prices have increased over the years but not by much. They offer discount pricing. If you buy more they give a discount. They are priced at around $2-2.25 each depending on the flavour.   Overall, this place is reasonably priced and delicious!   P.S. This place is cash only."}
{"text":"This little shop is located inside a Korean supermarket. They make all the taiyaki right before your eyes and it smells soooo damn good.  Although the scent was super luring, the taste fell a bit flat for me. I find the dough on the inside to be a bit soggy.  Was I suppose to wait and let it cool down first? But how can I wait when it smelled that good!   There's 4 different flavours (red, green and black bean and custard). It's $2 for one or $9 for 5.  I ordered the red bean and custard. The red bean was not bad but I didn't get to try the custard because my husband inhaled it.  Guess I'll just have to go back and get the custard next time."}
{"text":"Freshly made taiyaki, perfect to eat while walking outside in the cold, warming your hands and your belly. Located at the entrance of PAT Central Market, the sweet aroma welcomes customers as they come in and do their grocery shopping.  They offer different filling - black/red/green bean or custard, my favourite one is custard. After a certain time at night they give discount on the taiyaki, great for stocking up for sharing or eat them all by yourself."}
{"text":"It took us  a lot of time to find it in the night. It was just a small window in a Korean market. Ordered custard one and red bean one. The  red bean one was great, the other was just average. Both of them are a little greasy."}
{"text":"Get their custard flavour taiyaki. I was so full at the time yet it was sooo goood.   It's $1.75 for a single red bean, black bean or green bean flavoured taiyaki. It's $2 for a single custard flavoured taiyaki. They also sell them in packs of 5s for a better deal.  Taiyaki (Boong-uh bang/Fish bread/Fish waffle) is one of popular street food in Korea and it tastes best when it's freshly made right in front of you.  This place is inside a Korean grocery store called PAT. You can park on a street or in a municipal lot or park behind the building at the PAT parking lot."}
{"text":"A small shop inside the P.A.T Mart on the left. The smell from the stand covers the whole Asian market. I was tempted by the smell too and eventually tried one.   It's a crispy fish shaped waffles, they offer 4 different flavors: green bean, black bean, red bean and custard. The beans are $2, the custard is 2.25$. If you ask me the ranking from the best to the meh would be as follows: custard, red bean, black bean and green bean being the most meh on the list.   The texture is really good, the crisp is there. It's better than most sugary and overly sweet snacks out there."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars... one of the better Taiyaki I've had in Ontario.  The waffle is pretty close to the ones I've had in Asia.  I've had a few taiyaki around the world and my current favourite has to be in a Taiwan night market.  It's supposed to be a tempered sweet crispy waffle that is light and airy just creating the perfect crunchy case over sweet molten custard in the middle.  Kevin taiyaki is just hiding inside PAT Korean supermarket and it's right by the door.  You can probably smell the baked waffle before actually seeing the little counter. Just a warning to those who are not familiar with Asian supermarkets... the conditions can be a little haphazard and well, 'hole in a wall-ish' but don't let that stop you from trying it.  Kevin's taiyaki are super hot and made on the same grill and moulds as I saw in Asia.  They often just make huge batches and usually never last very long as many people pop in quickly to grab one for a snack.  These are really affordable... $2 or $2.25 with tax built in.  There's a deal where you can grab 5 for $9.  Oh quick note, it's cash only here.    I ordered a custard one and it was nice and hot.  The exterior was crispy and had a nice brown to it.  It smells really nice.  Just a warning to anyone who's never had one before... even though you can hold it, the custard inside is SUPER hot.  When I took my first bite, I had that nice satisfying crunch then had a good mouthful of hot custard.  I always like eating the head first ... just cause as a kid, I always imagined the fish complaining i'm eating him as I polish off the treat.  If I eat the head first, he can't talk... right?  Please tell me this is what other kids did too!    It comes soo close to the good ones.. what's missing? Well, they have the dough exterior right but the inside is a bit too wet doughy... perhaps they have their mould super hot and it cooks the outside too fast compared to the inside?  or maybe these were held for a while on the mould and the custard made the dough a bit soggier.  The custard was really thick but it didnt have the wonderful sweet eggy taste I've had in Asia.  This was generic super light sweet.  It should be closer to the taste of the molten egg yolk but less sweet.  Perhaps the red bean one would have better flavour?  Don't get me wrong... this is probably the best I've had in Ontario and arguably in Canada.  It's quite good but my Asian memories and this decent version makes me miss them even more from Taiwan."}
{"text":"Ahhhh..what irresistible deliciousness.. It was amazing :') Where have you been all my life?!?   Perfect crispiness with the right amount of buttery taste and filled with custard that gushed out with every bite.. As the custard squeezed out from each bite, I almost squeezed out a tear! I gotta say..it was Godly! :')   Ordered: 1 custard ($2?) and 1 red bean ($1.75?)  Event: DT Food Date with bf  Location: ktown..inside P.A.T mart! (I was so sad when I couldn't find it.. I thought they closed down!)  Forget Krispy Kreme Donut! Kevin's Taiyaki all the waay.   Must..return..for more.."}
{"text":"I've had Taiyaki before from the food cart around Finch station but this is by far the best i've ever tasted.   Kevin's Taiyaki is a tiny little stand in the PAT supermarket.   They have custard, red bean, black bean and green bean fillings. Other than finding the fillings pretty sweet, these Taiyakis are 9.5/10."}
{"text":"2.5  This Kevin's Taiyaki is located inside H Mart on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill.  Bungeoppang: Korean Red Bean Fish Cake Pastry is made freshly at this food stall. I just found the cake so so compares to Red Bean Waffles House and a little more pricey at 4 for $5.  The nice guy at the stall who was busy making both Bungeoppang and Korean rice poppers though was super nice enough to offer me an extra fish cake and 2 poppers free to try hence the rounding up to 3 star.  I ended up reheating them in the oven the next day and made the outer layer crispy around which ended up tasting A-OK."}
{"text":"I had an short fling with a Korean named Kevin. If he made as good Taiyaki as Kevin's Taiyaki, then we would have potentially lasted. He didn't; so we didn't.   Jokes aside, Kevin's Taiyaki is a little store within a Korean supermarket.  He serves the best taiyaki in town! Crisp exterior with oosey-gooey centre! Your choice of centers: red bean, black bean, green bean or custard!  No fish was harmed in the making of these taiyaki!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!  Kevin's taiyaki is the best!  Located inside H Mart in Richmond Hill.  Take some home!"}
{"text":"best taiyaki in toronto! crispy outside, chewy and gooey on the inside. good size, and well priced."}
