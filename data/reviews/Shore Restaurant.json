{"text":"Good food, great service. If you and a small crew wanna smash on some good diner breakfast this is the spot. The only downside is that this place only takes cash. I believe it is family owned and operated and they make you feel at home. It's a hole in the wall kinda spot , but most good places are right? 5 or 6 booths 4 or 5 tables and 6 or 7 counter spots with bar stools. bacon was oo la la."}
{"text":"I love the no-nonsense bare-minimum simplicity of this diner. Some of my friends and I love to get breakfast a little later than usual, so a diner like this is ideal. My food was good, the service was okay, and my coffee did the trick. Great quick stop!"}
{"text":"Strong coffee, hot food, cheap prices. The perfect spot for the morning after a night out. Lakewood at it's finest."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite breakfast spots! The food is great and always cooked very well, but what makes it best is the family who owns it. They are incredibly nice, always welcoming, remember you even if you just came in once, they interact with you and make you feel like family instantly!! There is nothing bad I have to say about this place, except that you might have to wait for a seat since it's usually always busy :)"}
{"text":"I got the Greek omelette, home fries, hash browns, toast and coffee. I've been here like 6 times.  Shore has awesome food. Just what you're lookin' for. I mean, if you want a no-nonsense breakfast, come here. Some people are looking for some type of high class breakfast with other frivolous things. Not here, just good ol' Cleveland working class breakfast.   The food is great (homemade in back, saw it myself) but that's not what makes this place. It's the owner and his wife. I've gone in there from 6am and at 4 or 5am and they are always concerned about you, about their customers. The first time I had breakfast there, there, the owner sat down with me and we talked while food was being made in the back. It was great.      PRO TIP: Go in at about 5.30 or 6.00 am and have a talk with the owner. I wish I remembered his name, but I've only met him once."}
{"text":"Your textbook Mom and Pop diner. Dad runs the kitchen while the Mom and two sons do everything else on the floor.  Very genuine and kind people, I have been going there now for about 5 years.   Amazing food at an amazing price.   If you live in the area do yourself a favor and try them at least once.   Only downside is that it's cash only, but 20$ is more than enough for breakfast/lunch for two so you can't complain."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  The small town atmosphere - the family owned and operated vibe and our food was great.   They seem to work really hard to make everyone feel welcome.  The sons keep the conversation going with the customers and try to get to know their clients. That is not very common now a days.        BUT although we checked Yelp for Star Ratings before we visited here, we missed the part about them only taking CASH! Sooooo...there we were with our credit card and holy Moses we were stuck!!  But I told the Mom I would stay as her hostage till my husband ran to get money!  She was so good natured about it!  She told me stories while I waited!  I also noted that they cleaned all the salt and pepper shakers and other condiment holders in hot water...very nice!         I had the Gyro ( yes I pronounced it wrong, but the son that was waiting on us said he would forgive me..!), my husband got the Greek Omelet and both were great!        We will def go back and def bring money!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast/lunch only, a no frills hole in the wall, family-owned spot where Pop does the kitchen duties, Mom manages the front and waits tables, and two sons wait tables, fill coffee, and talk sports with anybody who wants to jump in!  Tasty, some inventive omelets, but after all these years they haven't managed to make truly outstanding coffee.  Cash only, so be warned.  Park in back and enter thru the back door, or park on Detroit and come in the front."}
{"text":"Breaking my (unintentional) Yelp hiatus to review some great spots. First on the list is Shore restaurant. Friendly service and the food tastes great. Portions are enormous! Good coffee too."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need a no frills place to grab a quick breakfast. Not only do you get great service in a family owned establishment but you get quality food and great conversation. I talked to one of the owners (the wife) for over 20 minutes and loved hearing her story about where she came from and that they have owned this diner for 31 years!  Their coffee is good and their menu is simple and inexpensive. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I got gyro meat and swiss cheese on a bagel. It was delicious! My coffee (which I had 3 cups), the breakfast sandwich and potatoes came out to be $8 with tax. Now that's my kind of breakfast!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is basically perfect. Great portions, great prices, food was awesome - just honest and delicious, service was fantastic! Very relaxed atmosphere too. If you're starting your day off with breakfast here, it's probably going to be a great day!"}
{"text":"I stopped for a late mooring breakfast and my order was taken immediately.  I ordered 3 eggs over easy, sausage on the recommendation of the server and home fries.   I asked that the home fries be browned up.  The food arrived promptly and was excellent.  The eggs were done perfectly, something that doesn't always happen.  The sausage was tasty.  Not overly salty like some places.  The home fries came out just as ordered.  The coffee was typical \"diner coffee\", nothing special.    My final bill came to $7.62."}
{"text":"Family-run business with the husband doing the cooking and the wife waiting tables.  It's a little hole-in-the-wall.  This is standard diner fare at rock-bottom prices.  I ordered the breakfast special of 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast and it only set me back $2.75.  You know you're in for a treat when the menu is the old-school plastic letters on a peg board!  Opens at 6am and there is a parking lot in the rear.  Enter through the back screen door to get the full effect."}
{"text":"I stopped here on New Years because of the lighted corn beef sandwich sign. It looks like it may be a nice diner ran by nice people, and most of the menu looked fair. When it comes to the CB though, this isn't the place to go. Sandwich was same price as other places, but half the size (or less) of what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast/lunch spot right on Detroit. It seems kind of tucked away in a small strip but has a very \"at home\" and relaxed feeling. The food is all made to order and the service is quick. Great for those weekend mornings.."}
{"text":"Great family owned diner! I got the Greek omelet - it was priced well for the amount of food and quality. Very friendly service and food came out quickly. Will definitely return! Cash only but they have an ATM if needed."}
{"text":"Staff are super friendly. This is a good breakfast spot we go to a few times a year. They have good omelets."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch  food is outstanding   Nice family run business. We all had lunch. Food came out hot and lots of it. Be sure to check their special breakfast menu.   We will be back.   Also love to see a place that is family owned. Clean restrooms. Great food you get 5 stars."}
{"text":"While looking to try some new spots, I came across Shore Restaurant. Perfect breakfast for the unbelievable perfect price. My mom and I went in and sat at the bar. Most of the tables were taken and we knew we wanted to be fast so this was most logical. So much fun chatting with the family that owns this breakfast joint. Bring cash and come hungry. The veggie omelet and scrambled eggs and toast with a side of hash browns were perfect for the both of us. Enjoy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"They have the best sausage in town! Also the weekly specials are cheep and awesome.(Cash only here, btw)"}
{"text":"It's like eating in my grandma's  old house... But not as nice, and service was definitely not as good. Old everything. Lumpy brown benches, old laminate tables, and no decor to speak of. Service was not the rudest I've experienced, but not great. The food was meh at best, and the place needs a good cleaning. How this hole in the wall is still surviving when there are so many cute places in Lakewood is beyond me. We only ran here because of time and proximity. I was looking for the typical little \"hole in the wall\" gem, I just got a hole."}
{"text":"Typical diner but with a Greek twist - order nearly anything with gyro meat on the side. Good food, great staff and service. CASH ONLY (ATM inside)."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot. The portions and prices are great. The service is phenomenal and that's what keeps me coming back. I have yet to find a place where the staff is so friendly and make you feel that welcome. I only wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"First thing.... CASH ONLY!!!!  I was impressed by how clean and neat this little hidden diner gem is. Came for Sunday brunch and the majority of tables were filled. The coffee was fresh and piping hot. I had the french toast and eggs, which was delicious. Boy had the corned beef omelet and wasn't that impressed. Said it was blan and didn't have taste. They load your plate with fresh potatoes which i thought were pretty good, could use some onions in them but def were fresh and not \"store\" bought. The service was very friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"The food was good, friendly service, it's just basic breakfast which I love but why do so many mom and pop breakfast places that usually have the best food, have to have a TV blaring behind the counter with The local news? I'm already out and know the weather; I don't want to be see the grieving family member with a microphone in their face while they're still in shock being asked how they feel,already know the Browns and Cavs lost; I can watch TV at home, I came out to eat for a quieter experience. My employees cannot watch TV while they are at work unless they are in the break room. Shhh, I'm trying to eat my Rye toast!"}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful, nice local family owned business that's been around for 30yrs. This is the second time I've eaten here.  The first time the food was pretty good for the price.  I had coffee and 2 eggs which came with home fries and toast all under $5.  I went back today since my first experience was pretty good and ordered the egg sandwich.  I got it on an English muffin with sausage and cheddar cheese and it also came with home fries.  It was a pretty big sandwich, and I was only able to eat half (which is great).  It was also under $5 (also great). My only complaint wld have to b the sausage (not a fan).  I assumed it was going to b a patty, but it was links chopped up into 1\" chunks.  They didn't stay on the sandwich and just rolled out,  and also wasn't very tasty .  So if ur tight on cash and want a decent breakfast this is a great place to go (just beware the sausage)."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast place that serves your traditional breakfast at a cheap price. Cash only."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast in Lakewood. The prices and portions are good, the food is good, and the service is great. This place is small and only takes cash so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick and cheap breakfast. We had great service and our food was delicious. The pancakes and gyro meat alone are worth the trip. Definitely will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"One of the best authentic diners in lakewood! and there's a lot.... very small yet unintrusive. great service with a family owned atmosphere"}
{"text":"Homey atmosphere, friendly efficient service, delicious home-cooked food. The lovely family that operates this restaurant is kind and understanding of even the littlest diners. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place is great I must of been hungover when I went the first time, 4 years ago friendly staff great food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food at a value. I love the food and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I have a hard time telling people about this place. Not because it isn't freaking wonderful, but because they don't have a lot of seats & I don't want it to get so popular that I have to wait forever to get my delicious food! Tina and the rest of the family really make the Shore something special. I mean, the food is some of the best diner food you'll find in Cleveland, but there's something about a family all working together, you know? They remember faces, and are always making sure you're taken care of. Everything that I've had from there has been exactly what I hoped it would be, but there is a special place in my heart for their tuna salad sandwich. I know, right? Tuna salad. Who even cares about tuna salad? But it is my favorite sandwich in Cleveland. Try it, even if you don't typically go for that sort of thing. I don't, either, with this one exception. They have pretty typical diner hours - only open until mid-afternoon, and it is cash only. But it's worth a trip to the ATM. Just...let's not tell TOO many people about it, okay? It'll be our secret place."}
{"text":"Yet another diner in Lakewood, OH.  The Shore is pretty good.  I would put them ahead of a few of the diners within a mile such as Dianna's.  They are not 24 hours however.  I have always had fast and friendly service here and they have cheap and good breakfasts.  Not many places will you find those three words together:  cheap, fast and good."}
{"text":"Normally my husband and I venture to Lakewood for an elaborate brunch or dinner. But this time we just wanted a good breakfast, and that's exactly what we got! No frills. Just your traditional diner dishes with the traditional breakfast meats ( no turkey bacon or chicken sausage).   I ordered my usual: 2 eggs over medium, hash browns ( with onions added), rye toast and bacon ( which I give to my husband since I don't eat pork). My husband ordered a Greek omelette. The food was good. Again, standard breakfast food cooked well. I don't have anything bad to say. And I don't have anything special to say either...because it just was what you would expect and that's ok!  But the reason we absolutely enjoyed this place was the hospitality. We felt as though we walked into a family's home for a meal. As soon as we entered we were greeted with a smile and told to sit where we like. I look to my right as I sat in a booth and a on older couple were there with their small dog. This dog, off least, just sauntered over to say hello. I'm not thinking everyone can bring their dog, but I feel these people were regulars. I felt everyone was a regular based on the interactions with the staff. The two gentlemen who worked there carried on a lighthearted conversations with another couple for most of our meal all the while waiting on the rest of the patrons in the place.   I never had an empty water glass or coffee cup.  Everyone was so attentive and it was a joint effort on all the staff's parts to make the customer's dining experience excellent. It felt like a real family business.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice vintage diner. Food was great and came out really quick! Just above what I'd consider broke-college-student friendly in terms of price. They don't accept credit cards though."}
{"text":"Had Souvlaki pork dish and coffee.  My wife had traditional breakfast.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"The Shore is a great place to grab breakfast. This is a classic little Lakewood restaurant and is similar to the Place to Be but a couple miles east. They only take cash so be sure to bring a few dollars. One can easily eat for under $10 with tip included. The staff could not be any friendlier and seem to have developed close knit bonds with the customers. People wait in lines for Borderline, Lucky's, Grumpy's, South Side, Petite Triangle, Flap Jacks and all of the other cool brunch spots. If you come to the Shore, you can eat some delicious food and hang out with cool people."}
{"text":"Angelo and Tina were strangers to us as we entered the Shore Restaurant.  Tina poured our coffee and it was better than any high end coffee I have had in years.  They served us a classic American Breakfast while making me feel like I was visiting there home.  Best place I could find to eat breakfast while visiting Lakewood."}
{"text":"Have not been here since I was 18, super pumped when I realized it was still open and under the same great ownership! THis was my go-to a decade ago and just may re-acquire the throne for places to eat breakfast.  Coffees not the best, not the worst and the food is pretty much what you ask for and expect. There is no mind blowing menu that you will catch yourself staring blindly at for 20 minutes trying to decide what to order. It is a self- sustaining business that survives on a good customer base and supreme clientele, just like GFK. It is family owned and operated and that has a presence throughout the place. It is one of those places you almost have the feel you can talk to anyone in the place comfortably.   Like I said, it has a lot of sentimental value behind it for me and great memories \"of the highest grade!\" :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Family owners are all extraordinary nice!  Home style, diner food is consistently good and inexpensive as it gets!  I have never experienced better for the price.  The Breakfast Special is my fav!"}
