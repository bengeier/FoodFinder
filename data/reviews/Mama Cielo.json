{"text":"If I could give a negative star review I would. Friend and I came in here on Friday for lunch and ordered three tacos and a burrito. It took 30 minutes for us to get our food and when she brought it out, it was completely wrong. She brought out a torta and fries and beef soup. No burrito and no taco. Wtf. 

She said they were busy. 

There were two other tables with patrons. Total of 4 others. 

Not sure what was going on there. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious menudo! Excellent customer service. I asked for corn tortillas since I'm from Mexico City and that's how I eat Menudo, and happily realized that they are freshly handmade tortillas! My boyfriend asked for bread since that's how he eats it because he's from northern Mexico. And it was deliciously toasted and it had butter on it. All I can say is that I am more than willing to drive again and again from DTPHX to Guadalupe for this wonderful food and to tell everyone I know about it!"}
{"text":"Went again with a Mexican American friend she had the tripa and lengua tacos and she loved the both.  She thought they were authentic and delicious.  I had the sopes again and loved them, I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican flavors, a clean and welcoming environment with delicious foods, this is the spot. I had the Chile relleno plate and every thing about it was perfect. The hand made corn tortillas are totally legit along with their salsas and Agua frescas. Plus they have the Mexican treats that make me proud to be Mexicana. Gracias Mama Cielo, your food was heavenly."}
{"text":"Love this place! The tortillas are hand made to order and everything is fresh from the salsa, toppings and fillings. Al Pastor tacos are my favorite. Also, they have Jamaica! Service is excellent and everything is super clean. If you're in Tempe and want fresh, authentic Mexican food, come here."}
