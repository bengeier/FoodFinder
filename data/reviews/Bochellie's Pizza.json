{"text":"tried this place tonight! Wowwwww! Had the deluxe,  i swear it weighed like 10 pounds. also had the wings,  the hot bbq was probably one of the best sauces I've ever had.  my girlfriend had the club sub,  she loved it.  highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in North Royalton! Delicious pizza, great service! I even had them catered and had to go back for more! Such a hit with the entire family!!"}
{"text":"Finally a reliable place... they have the BEST pizza in North Royalton! Amazing food and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"We ordered a extra large pepperoni pizza.  They make a ny style pizza (thin crust). The sauce was a little spicy and the crust seemed a little chewy.  Over all I it was just so so pizza and I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Only giving a 1 star because I have too...  The first time I called to place an order for delivery they told me that they were closed. Once I hung up I looked at the menu again and noticed they were open until 10pm. I called two hours in advance! I called back and said that I wanted to place an order for delivery, the gentleman said okay and rudely placed me on hold. Once they got back on the phone he asked me what I would like I told him The Godfather, he said they were out of bread. I then just hung up.  Obviously they could care less to have any business since they lied the first time about being closed, to not not having bread! This is an Italian place! Never ate here and now I never will."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza place in town! The food is always consistent and tasty. The wings and subs are delicious too! Bochellie's has been our families Friday night dinner, since they've opened! Thank you!"}
{"text":"really good pizza. super nice people. really good prices. so so so glad they moved into the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Tried this brand new pizza shop that is around the corner from us. It is run by a friendly staff and has quick service. My girlfriend and I love their thin crust pizza and unique sauce. Be sure to try their pepperoni sticks and garlic knots, which are delicious. Great addition to the neighborhood. Keep up the good work. Will recommend!"}
