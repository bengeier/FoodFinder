{"text":"Larell, Stephanie and Bia were incredible bartenders. They truly made the experience one of a kind. The food was amazing.  Double smoked bacon,  tuna tartar and duck liver (compliments of the chef)  were amazing."}
{"text":"Our order:  Watermelon Basil Alcoholic Drink - this was delicious a bit sweet but I enjoy sweet!  Lemonade- they use sparkling water and simple syrup, one child liked it one didn't  Caesar Salad- it had a slight sour taste, large portion definitely  enough to share  Macaroni and Cheese - cheesy goodness  Mashed Potatoes - My husband loved this, I prefer lumpiness  Brussel Sprouts- these were great, nice and tender with bits of bacon  Lemon Chicken - Not a very large portion, well seasoned and not dry  Short Ribs - No need for a knife they fell lff the bone and the sauce was great. My 8 year old ordered this and finished his plate  Lobster- steamed and then grilled, a tad dry, didn't enjoy the sauce they provided on the side. Good enough to order again.  Bone in Ribeye- they char their steaks so if you don't like it sure specify when you order or you will be unhappy. Pretty average compared to Ruth Chris, Mortons and DelFriscos  Margo our waitress made the meal. We all enjoyed our food, wish we had room for dessert. Service was impeccable and we will be back.  Total Bill: $370 with a 22% tip and two alcoholics beverages"}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour of half price cocktails in the bar! Such fantastic service too, after trying a few different places BLT became our favorite place for happy hour cocktails and bar snacks. The popover bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Vegas for 13 years and have been searching for the best steakhouse in Vegas.  We've finally found it at BLT Steak inside Bally's.  Truly the most flavorful steaks we've ever had combined with finely crafted cocktails and an impressive wine list.  This spot is a hidden Vegas jewel.  Consider yourself lucky to have found it!"}
{"text":"(I visited in may of this year so the little details are a little spotty but it was still a memorable experience)  O.M.G!   Amazing from start to finish. I purchased the Travelzoo voucher and it was totally worth it. $115 for $122 worth food. Look for it.  All the food was delicious. The poppers they give you at the start....well I can't really describe them. Just so good.   I couldn't have alcohol at the time so the bartender made a mean virgin mojito. I had 2!   I must admit, we did struggle to use our voucher up. So the waiter just kept bringing us more food. He definitely earned 5 stars.   Consensus: I will go again even without a voucher"}
{"text":"Went here last night for my anniversary dinner, steak was delicious. Service was great, very friendly staff.  Meal: Complimentary bread Complimentary popovers- very yummy!  Shrimp cocktail- my weakness! Delicious!  Deviled eggs- don't even bother, these were the \"chef's special,\" bland and had powdered bacon... Filet 10oz and asparagus - Perfect! Also got a side of chimichurri sauce  Kobe Filet with green beans - Melts in your mouth! Oh my goodness my husband was in love. He also got the peppercorn sauce with added some heat flavor.   Some other things to note: No bathroom in restaurant, need to go out onto casino floor Limited beer selection A la crate style menu"}
{"text":"Megan is amazing! Management hovers a bit too much but I guess that is because the restaurant is so new. I had a great time!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having a good piece of filet mingnon. Ordered the Eagu Kobe cut medium. Asked for horseradish. Ordered a nice glass of Cabarnet. That is when everything fell apart.  First the bread was below par. At least not my taste. That can be forgiven.  The filet mingnon was overcooked! That is a sin. Told the waiter about. He took it back,. Manager never showed up. Had to seek her after I paid for my wine.   Them the manager had the odacity to tell me that she took care of me by not charging me for the steak and baked potato ( which I didn't to get to try). I told her if she wanted to take care of me she would not charge me for the wine. She declined.   Make your own decision, but when a business makes you feel that they are doing you a favor for taking your money, they don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, our server Javier was the best, steak was perfect, warm chocolate truffle wasn't as good as it sound, but everything else was perfect..."}
{"text":"And some of the other reviewers said I had a Travelzoo voucher appetizers were good and popovers were delicious my wife had the filet and I had the New York strip I would have to say the filet was tender but a little dry my New York steak was cooked perfectly but it wasn't was not as tender as it should be we had the stuffed mushroom caps as a side and I'm afraid that we were very disappointed in those it seemed like they were overdone my biggest complaint would have to be the service we saw our waiter only a few times and actually the manager had to bring over are popovers before our dinner and after we finished eating my wife had to stack the dishes and then a manager came over and asked if there was anything wrong and she said yes nobody's clean the table he said he was sorry also the Ambiance in this place is really bad very very noisy for the prices they charge you should be able to eat in a quiet dining experience I sometimes feel that when you have a voucher and since you're not paying full price they're not going to give you full service I've had this happen to us before"}
{"text":"The wife and I recently dined at BLT Steak at Bally's Las Vegas.  We were seated shortly after checking in at the front for our reservations.  They asked us if we were celebrating anything, and we told them it was an anniversary. The kitchen and staff were awesome in that they gave us two flutes of champagne and a duck pate appetizer on the house. Totally unexpected, but a very nice gesture.  We ordered a burrata appetizer and had the popovers. Both were good, but very filling so we had limited space left for the entrees.  Both of us ordering the bone-in ribeye probably didn't help, but the steaks came out perfectly medium rare.  They came with a pat of melting herb butter, roasted garlic clove, and a small bone marrow with accompanying small spoon....delish! We had the truffle mash potatoes and the roasted brussel sprouts.  While both sides were thankfully small, the potatoes were on the meh side, but the brussel sprouts were quite good.  We both had a wine by the glass with our meal.   We were in a bit of a rush to catch a show so we couldn't get dessert, much less have space for it anyway."}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal.  I had the ribeye which came with a nice bone on the side with a fork to scoop out the marrow.  The steak was perfectly seared on the outside and just the right temperature and color on the inside for a medium done steak.  The double cut bacon appetizer was great also.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went for an experience that everyone seems to want, to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. What better one for dinner than the one being competed for this season on Hell's Kitchen.   Service was ok, somewhat attentive but not ordering the extras such as bottled water or wine seems to annoy the server. The pop overs were awesome, let's say that was where the experience climaxed.  The wedge salad was pretty good too, as was the steak civiche. Now let's talk about the main courses. I ordered a 10 ounce filet and forgot to add a sauce, did it need it..nope but no reminder ask from the server. That was odd.  The scallops, we're full of flavor but they seem to cope with each other. Don't get me wrong, great flavors but so many it took from the dish. I hear the great chef talk about too many flavors and was surprised. The sides were truffle mash and stuffed mushroom caps. The mash looked horrible. Brown soup. Yes a mash consistency but not appealing and the caps were good but dark brown and well not visually appealing either.   So if you go, expect to pay for the experience and the food is descent but not what I would expect watching the critiques from Chef Ramsay."}
{"text":"AVOID the surf and turf option!!! That $20 is exactly like everything else on the menu, too good to be true! My wife and I got this and it turned it to be two chunks of meat, literally two chunks of meat on an onion ring!  Overall, it was a very overpriced meal!"}
{"text":"I went last night with my wife. I'm torn in this review a little. I feel like my experience should have been great. But it wasn't. The service was top notch - our waiter was terrific. I have no complaints about service. The service was top notch and what I would expect. I think it was the value for the food I got that troubles me. The popovers were huge- but they weren't warm and while we ate them all they weren't overwhelming. The chef sent out a tasting pâté. It was good but it was too salty and I like salty food. Our glasses of wine were very expensive for what seemed like very small glasses of wine. My NY strip was huge and good, but I don't think it was $45 good. I've cooked ones as good at home for a fraction of the price. And then I had to order a side for $11. My wife got sea bass grenobloise. It too was good, but at $36 with no side it just seems like it should have been better. Our sides - BBQ corn and Brussels sprouts were both great but I don't think they were $11 great. We didn't have room for desert but the chef sent out a dessert petit four for us. They were good too and appreciated. Maybe I'm just not a steakhouse person. It just seems like for the prices we paid the meal should have been memorable and special. Instead I felt like it was fine to good. Take it for what it's worth - just one opinion!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your significant other out for a romantic dinner.  Reservation is recommended, no long line or wait especially in Las Vegas.  The place is very elegant and the  atmosphere is very roomy and quiet.  The food is very good.  Especially the popovers.  Best unique bread service I have ever tasted.  The service is super excellent.  You get one main waiter and an assistant to serve you during the entire event.  My wife and I had the following which I highly recommended: 1- Tuna Tartare 2- Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail 3-  Bone in Rib-eye (one dish can actual feed two people) 4 - Crepe Souffle  We also tried the Lobster Salad but it was okay, nothing significantly unique or special.  Will definitely come back here again next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Am impressed with the service  of allie and jim. Perfection. Will absolutely return for more! Filet is excellenf, nice char, great flavour. Great service. We will be back. The bartender is awesome, wish my husband remembered his ,name, Great drinks, Great food, amazing service. Repeat. customer for sure. Thank you foe everything! Allie And Jim are fantastic."}
{"text":"The bacon appetizer is outstanding especially when you dip that delicious bread in the grease. Mmmm. The filet was very good - similar to all of the other high end steakhouses. The onion rings were good. All in all would definitely go back but I can't say that it separates itself from the pack. Very solid."}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday night. Extremely underwhelming. I've eaten at the BLT in NYC and it was great. This was not. Ordered the NY strip for $56.00. It tasted like a $20.00 steak from Brio's. No flavor. Was extremely disappointed. I do not recommend this restaurant for the Vegas location. The NYC location was great."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of a steak house in Bally's but I was proven wrong. The layout of the restaurant was ok but the service was exceptional, from the moment we arrived the staff made us feel special. Pre appetizer offered by the kitchen was delicious variety of meats, Iberico ham, salami, etc. The Caesars salad was fantastic! Popovers came to the table next, so good I would go again just for the popovers! Then the entree arrived, lobster and filet mignon, so much food, food coma was setting in, waiting for the check the kitchen offered sweet treat to send us on our way, what a fantastic meal! It may cost a little more to eat here but we left feeling like we had a true eating experience, so many great flavors, we couldn't stop talking how much we loved the food and cannot wait to go again! Congratulations to Bally's for opening a great restaurant and thanks to the team at BLT! You deserve a round of applause!"}
{"text":"Celebrating our 10 year anniversary, our server, Leslie, was beyond exceptional, as was the entire staff.  Our steaks were prepared perfect and the champagne and dessert extras were amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome service, unfortunately did get there names!  Popovers fantastic and NY strip was so flavorful!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Michelin rated restaurants before, but none had provided me the same quality of tear-jerking flavor like this. This is arguably a hidden treasure that should have far more recognition then it gets."}
{"text":"Was nice steak, but not amazing, and the head chef wasn't the hells kitchen winner as we expected.   Nice evening overall."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at BLT Steak on a recommendation from a friend.  I had the bone-in ribeye steak with truffle mashed potatoes and my wife had the wagyu beef ribeye.   Both dishes were outstanding!   My ribeye was cooked perfect or order and just the right amount of \"crust\" on it.  The steak was so large, I had difficulty finishing it.   My only criticism with this place is where our table was located. Despite our reservation,  we were seated what appeared to be outside the main seating area, next to a bar.   So, slight disappointment in the ambiance department,  but not enough for me to knock it down a star.  The food more than made up for it!"}
{"text":"Trip to Vegas for step daughter 21 b day.  2 out of 4 steaks were cooked the way we ordered.  Manger, Tammy, was gracious and professional, offered us credit to be used the next day.  We used credit and had great time at bar with Bartender Stephanie making us some nice drinks and eating appetizers watching some pre season football.  overall food okay. customer service excellent. Drinks very good."}
{"text":"We want here for a special graduation dinner. We were a bit disappointed from the get go because we sat unnoticed by our server for 10 minutes... Our waiter Cujo was attentive without being overbearing. The food was great, dipping sauces for days... Wedge salad was, meh.  Complimentary popovers, that came way late, were awesome. Pâté was complimentary too, but we can't say if it was good, it's not our scene.  Steaks were cooked perfectly, best Brussels sprouts in CLT.  Dessert was b-o-m-b. Peanut butter mousse, get it."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience! The entire staff goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service. Daniel is the most incredible server ever, he was personable, caring, and made us feel like we were the only customers in the whole restaurant. I was blown away by everything he did for us. The food is out of this world as well. We will be back to see Daniel very soon, thank you BLT for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"This could be the best steak I've ever had. From the moment we entered, we felt a certain calm and harmony about this place. We stopped at the bar first. There is a happy hour from 4 to 6 every day and the cocktails are exceptional. Regarding the dinner, our food was prepared perfectly and presented beautifully. The steaks were prepared exactly as we asked. This chef is exceptional and the general manager runs this place just right. It is a hidden oasis in Vegas and deserves much more of your attention. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I went with my family to BLT Steak after seeing one of the last Jubilee shows. The food was good as was the serve though it was not as smooth as it should have been in a high end restaurant. Dinner came out before they had prepped our table for the dinner entrees. Overall it was a nice experience and if you are at Bally's worth stopping at."}
{"text":"Fantastic service our waiter Aaron did a great job. The popoverwere very tasty.  The stakes are well seasoned. I will be back."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Hell's Kitchen so at first I try to book a table in Gordan Ramsay Steak. Unluckily, I failed so I choose BLT Streak instead. This Steak house is wonderful. I believe the food are not so expensive, they are acceptable and the quality is perfect. That steak cut is cooked perfectly, crab caked and dessert are also very tasty. Waiters are very polite and friendly, good experience."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 4 to celebrate the boyfriend's birthday. Intimate setting , dim lights. The hostess sat us right away even though we showed up 15min late (reservations was for 7pm). Our waiter, Javier was very courteous and friendly.  Complimentary appetizer was duck liver mousse..pretty interesting.  I probably wouldn't order it again but it was something different for us to try.  The fluffy breads and aged butter that they bring out before your meal was yummy. My BF and I shared 32ounce porterhouse steak. We ordered it medium well.  Best steak ever!!! The other couple in our party ordered the fillet mignon and that was delicious as well! Truffle mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese were our side dishes which we shared among the 4 of us. Service and food was amazing. It's pretty pricy but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time around in May. We came here to eat dinner before the Mariah Carey concert. Food was just as delicious as I remembered and their service was excellent.   This time around there was more people but we still got sat right away with reservations. Our server accommodated our time constraint. We were in and out within an hour. This steak resturant goes above and beyond for their customers.   We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Got done eating here a couple of hours ago, and I can still taste the utter disappointment. Come here if you enjoy an overpriced burnt, bland and tiny dinner. Their steaks were the most disappointing. While it came out on a cast iron skillet, it did NOT sizzle with the usual amazing butter aroma. Instead, the bone-in strip AND filet mignon were room temperature and tasteless. It was the toughest piece of \"prime\" meat I have ever had. Even worse, while cutting into it, you did not get that juicy pink center.... instead we got a very dry brownish pewter color. Signs that it was a very old cut of meat and maybe should've been thrown out. We wasted a dining experience here and I felt responsible for taking my party here. Coming from California, I felt defeated for not being able to source a better place to dine. With only one night left in Vegas, I will have to knock it out if the park tomorrow night."}
{"text":"We chose this place because it was highlighted on Travezoo and it had a fairly good rating.  Yes, they do a lot of wooing and presentation.  The food, even though it looks appetizing, it's not.   We raise quality Angus beef and know the difference.  They served a porterhouse, rather sizable (32 ounce), was disgusting.  Even then tenderloin was not tender.  The New York strip side was tough and not easy to cut even with a steak knife.  There were a total of six of us and there were at least six issues with the order.    Two out of six at the table had positive things to say about the steak they were served, filet mignon,  and rib eye."}
{"text":"By far some of the best food we've ever had. Our waitress was Roxanne and the service was superb!   Duck pâté and popovers were complimentary starters and amazing. We also ordered the calamari and tuna tartare to start, which were both awesome. Then for the main course, we had the Porter steak (to share) - it literally melted in our mouths! It's a pricey dinner but absolutely worth it, I'm a frugal person, however I will say hands down we'll be back next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I see all of these positive reviews and my group of three, well, we won't be back to this location.  And it wasn't because of the food or the complimentary dessert bites because the food was indeed savory.  It was because of the waiter that serviced our table.  He was snooty and flat out rude.  My companions both ordered steak, it is after all a steakhouse and they received wonderfully prepared steaks that were quite large.  In fact large enough that you could take half of a piece home.  My husband and I shared one.  That is what got us \"on the bad side\" of the waiter.  But the truth is, neither of us could have eaten an entire steak ourselves.  And because I wasn't ordering my own meal, I was not entitled to water refills.  That's right you heard me, our waiter (not the busboy) would not refill my water glass when he filled my husband's glass and his colleague's glass.  In fact, the waiter would not acknowledge my presence whatsoever.  As a result he had 3 very unhappy, unsatisfied customers that felt he did not deserve a tip.   The bus boy was my personal waiter and we did tip him privately and the hostesses were polite and kind.  The three of us vowed not to return.  Next time we'll walk over to Paris and try Gordon Ramsey Steak as we know the steak will be just as good but perhaps the manager does a better job ensuring how his customers are treated by his staff.  Oh, and just so you know, the steaks were $50 a piece, if you wanted potatoes you paid an additional $10, if you wanted vegetables, you had to pay an additional $15.  If you do not order dessert the chef will send out a spoon-sized bite of dessert to top off the orders (in our case we received two, but that's fine by husband doesn't do sweets).  That was a classy touch, but I am sure it is meant to encourage you to change your mind and order dessert.  Had we received better service we would have ordered two desserts, one for myself and one for my husband's colleague.  We spent over $160 on dinner and had very little customer service at the table (the waiter seemed to be avoiding us altogether) So it goes to show, how the waiter treats the customer does impact how much the party is willing to spend and whether they will return or recommend to friends.  In our case, the recommendations are to avoid BLT Steak at Ballys!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Vegas for over 30 years and have dined in the best steak houses  In Vegas (Binion's, Hugo's cellar, ect.)   But this by far is the best I have ever dined in. Dined here the first week in June with 7 friends,  I shared the 36 once Porter house with my wife. It was cooked A perfect medium rare with a tasty outer crust.  We all ordered different sides and entrée's and no one was disappointed.     The lobster salad was to die for, so was the tuna tartar, and the peanut butter  mousse desert.     All my friends raved about their dishes. The new chef Ariel is winner of this years Hell's  Kitchen and it shows in her work. She is an artist. She came out, talked to us and showed us how passionate she is about her  Work. She is genuine and humble, and should be one of the next super star chefs in Vegas.    If you are in Vegas and want to experience The best dining in a city known for its cuisine  This is the place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, usually they're good, this last time (3 days ago) I'd been better off eating at a taco truck,  I can't tell you much about the server bc he was nowhere around,  the water server helped out a lot,  and the water was delicious! The mac and cheese not so much,  steak was dry, I left over half on the plate, wasn't impressed this go around and it cost too much money not to be impressed."}
{"text":"Did not eat there. Just has drinks at the bar prices a little high but it is on par for the strip not sure if we would go back but service was good and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Slow service, drinks sat empty half the meal.  Steak was delicious, but steak sauces and truffle mash were swimming in salt... not edible.  Mash was the consistency of soup. Stuffed mushrooms were a soggy, salty mess.  Tuna appetizer and duck liver spread were the best parts of the meal. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"LOVED IT. Went in and sat at the bar. Service was very good and very attentive. I had the oysters which were incredible along with the grilled Tuna. The Tuna was SO good. Went the next day with a large group of 30. They took care of us all very efficiently and with a smile. Drinks came out in a timely fashion along with the appetizers, salads and main course. In fact... I'm going back now"}
{"text":"Short Ribs nothing but fat.  Not an exaggeration, voiced our displeasure twice and and were completely ignored.  Have been in the Restaurant industry for 23+ years & I  would've been embarrassed to serve them.   I've never been served short ribs that the fat % was more  than the meat.  Live & learn, will not return. Don't waste your money. Thank God we had bread to eat."}
{"text":"Wow!  Such a treat.    I ordered the Wagyu Carpaccio with truffle fries as an appetizer which was unbelievably good.  The prime new york on-the-bone tasted incredible and was cooked perfectly.  My girlfriend had a side of  mashed potatoes that tasted great.  Prices here were about half the celebrity sponsored steakhouses on the strip, but BLT serves wagyu and dry-aged prime beef like they mean it.  I was blown away.  The waiters were friendly and helpful with the wine selection.  They knew my girlfriend would prefer the Riesling despite her normal affinity for Rose.  She tried a sample of both and agreed.  And the pop overs!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Well well well this date started of great my girl had money on the game and we got sat where we could see the tv we they have a great wine selection but we had brought our own it was a $35. Corking fee which is no big deal I ordered the 22oz bone in Ribeye and my lady had the waygu fillet not sure if I spelled that right but anyway the ribeye was a decent price but I'd rather take the drive down the street to Ruth Criss and my lady's steak had a little to much garlic but if you want the football game with your dinner this is the place football won it that 4th star"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Omar, our server, was outstanding. Would recommend the restaurant, and him specifically, to anyone. Thanks for a great night!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. The pop overs they give you before are so flakey and delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Beware of wine prices. My mom, sister and I sat at the bar while waiting for our table at a neighboring restaurant.  We were given a wine book with prices and ordered 2 glasses of wine and a beer.  The prices in the book ranged from $16- $35, so we thought that reflected bottle prices.  When we got our bill it was $70.00!  We just about crapped!  Each glass of wine was $29.00!  SO, if you're ordering wine, make sure you clarify if it's by the glass or bottle.  I have NEVER EVER seen wine by the glass for that much.  Obviously it exists, but shocked nonetheless."}
{"text":"Leon our server was awesome and very knowledgeable. Great food, service and ambiance is perfect for a date."}
{"text":"A good steakhouse on the strip.  The BLT brand has yet to disappoint me.  This place is kind of hard to find, its tucked in the back of Ballys, which already sits far back off the strip.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, and sides were excellent.  It is worth coming here just for the popovers.  People rave over the, but they are merely a vessel for the Vermont Creamery Cultured Butter.  Its like you have never eaten real butter before."}
{"text":"Service and food amazing. i got the t-bone and my gf got the skirt.  They have amazing popover bread at the beginning just be careful not to over eat they suck you in.  Overall highly recomend.  Look at tix4tonight for deals before going but definitely worth it for steak lovers."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse! The bone-in ribeye was excellent! Wedge salad was very good. Service was good and the manager is great! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful!  If it was possible to give this restaurant a zero, I would do it. Not sure if this was a fluke but everything from the server to the manager to the steak and sides were horrible!  For a $55+ dollar steak, you expect it to be cooked well.  Word to the wise, if you want a medium well steak tell them medium, for a medium steak tell them medium rare.  Someone in my party made the mistake of telling them medium and was brought out a well done steak...no pink and WAY overlooked. Also don't bother getting the $60 bone-in rib eye...the cut of the meat was awful!  It was way too chewy.  They seriously need to fire their butcher...or the chef that doesn't know how to cook steak at a steakhouse.  Also if you want chargrilled, inedible mushrooms then BLT is your place!  We expressed to the manager our concerns and promptly (15 minutes later) they brought out another bowl of inedible mushrooms.  We didn't see the manager again until the very end...never came back to check on us which is odd since he knew we weren't pleased with our meals. I'd almost give him a pass, but the restaurant was not even half full.  There are so many good restaurants in this town that I'm sure BLT won't survive with their subpar food and service."}
{"text":"We bought 50% off main dish deals from tix4night.com. So we decided to try this restaurant.  We ordered crab cake which was subpar and pricy ($17). For entrees, we ordered filet mignon and ribeye which were perfectly cooked and tasted very good.  You don't need seasoning sauce at all.  The meat was very tender and juicy.  We got stuffed mushroom for side dish and it was ok. Overall, if you are craving for a good quality steak,  go to BLT steak."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Our waiter David's recommendations were perfect. The tuna tartar and burrata appetizers were fantastic. Short ribs and Wagu filet were melt in your mouth amazing."}
{"text":"Oh my!! The best food experience I've had in a very long time. The service was superb. Such a comfortable atmosphere.could not have ask for better.OK NOW!! THE FOOD! no words to explain, beyond fantastic. When I left I ask someone to pinch me to see if I had really experienced such a great brunch on a Sunday. I wish that feeling on anyone else that goes to B.L.T.'s Sunday brunch. Yes, definitely a place I will go back to."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day reservations, 200 for the meal...would have loved to spend that if this had been a delicious steak...Their version of medium rare is not just red in the middle, but raw in the middle....sent the NY strip part back to be refired...it was awful to start with...tasteless and chewy...after recooking...was inedible....the filet part was never refired..and was chewy and tasteless...now we used to barbecue porterhouse steaks all the time and that part was like...divine...not the case....got the wrong potatoes first, which was ok,,,we didn't know the difference just thought they were just too crunchy....got our potato...a giant potato and we had to add the butter, etc...these are meant to share, but was so hot and so hard to put together...i didn't bother...two bites of steak each...oh, I had to have desert and ordered the creme broule...which was ruined by being topped with a bunch of berries...which were delicious by themselves, but you couldn't do the cracking of the top without removing them first....anyways....he custard had no flavor and the chocolate had a weird taste ....two words: don't bother!...plus...we are lined up against a wall in tables for two with couples sitting 6 inches from you...no intimacy...no nothin! Glad we are an old married couple who didn't really care about that, but ya know...some do.....don't come here....unless we just ordered wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was excellent.   I can't wait to make the popovers!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. Willy our server was phenomenal, such a great waiter! Everyone was super courteous and accommodating. We ate the oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail, NY strip, Filet mignon, and truffle mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious. The mashed potatoes is a must try and the shrimp were gigantic. Excellent job overall."}
{"text":"This review is more for the bar than the Resteraunt. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They took their time making our drinks, which is important to me. It's not at all a craft cocktail if the ingredients are just thrown together. The complementary bread unique and also very delicious."}
{"text":"DO NOT DINE WITH BLT STEAK BALLYS LAS VEGAS!!!!    My husband and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary at BLT Steak Ballys Las Vegas on Saturday, June 24, 2017. We purchased a $115 voucher from Travel Zoo; which was worth $210 dining credit. Our total after using the voucher plus taxes and gratuitywas $60. The next day we checked our bank and was charged two different amounts totaling $381.05. If you add this amount to how much we paid for the voucher, it cost us a grand total of $496.05 for dinner for two. We've contacted the restaurant twice and they claim to have only charged us $60. They're only willing to refund the $60 to us. They blame it on our bank and told us to dispute with our bank. This overcharge should have never happened. No customer should have to deal with this issue. Now I'm left with calling my bank, the restaurant and travel zoo to resolve this issue. There are plenty other restaurants in Las Vegas. Do not dine in with BLT Steak Ballys Las Vegas or you may get overcharged like us."}
{"text":"I've dined at pretty much every great steak house in America.  The Palm, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Angelo & Maxie's, Sam & Harry's, even Bern's in Tampa, you name it I've eaten there.  Anyway, last Monday, I took my wife to BLT's new place in Vegas for her birthday.  She had eaten at their place in Scottsdale and enjoyed it.  Monday is a quiet night in the restaurant business so I figured let's do it.   Staff was nice, but for a high end steak joint what a disappointment!  No drinks ordered, no appetizer.  Had their \"signature\" popovers, which were over baked (Hard outside and not fluffy inside like they should be).  Well, we looked forward to our steaks.  Wife ordered a filet, I ordered a bone in rib eye. We made small talk for 20 minutes.  Then 30 minutes.  Then an hour.   FINALLY a full 1 1/2 hours later we got the steaks.  Both were ordered med.  rare.  Wife's was fine, mine was close to raw.  Let's say very rare.  Asked to have it cooked more.  Manager comes back in 10 minutes with a medium cooked steak.  Let's see, 1 1/2 hours for the first steak (Very rare) , 10 minutes for the second (Medium).  Something doesn't compute?   When we got home I researched out the company phone number in NY.   Contact is normally via email on their website.   I was pi$$ed and wanted to vent.  Young woman said a \"director\" will call me.  Nada, no call.   They obviously don't care about customer retention or brand loyalty.   Lots of restaurant choices in Vegas so they obviously don't count on return customers.   Won't go back.   Also, won't go to BLTs in other cities. $155 birthday dinner and it was a lousy experience!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Bill $270. With tip for 2! Ceaser salad was good, mushroom caps were not! Green beans were ok! Says gremelada not the case! Porterhouse for two,$97.00 which would have been ok,but nearly half of steak was un chewable,ordered med rare received in various temps! Mostly rare,little sear! Under seasoned! Disappointed! Not worth the money! Won't return!"}
{"text":"The steak was outstanding, cooked perfectly. I highly recommend the BBQ corn. A must for a side. Brussel sprouts some of the best in town. The bread and I mean this, best in the world!!!  Let's talk about service. There is a reason the restaurant is located in the The Ritz Carlton. They mirror the great service of the hotel. Wait staff is great, knowledgeable and subtle. Very old school"}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered a 28 day aged ribeye and short ribs. The problem was the amount of wait time for the food to be ready. We came into the restaurant at 8pm and the food came out around 9:20pm. By the time we left, it was about 9:40pm. I am not sure if this is the norm at this restaurant but we literally spent almost two hours for a dinner. Honestly, I don't think it was the food preparation time that took so long. It seemed like the waiter was just not paying attention to our table for some reason. I consistently hinted my frustration of waiting at the waiter. He seemed to have noticed it, yet it did not do anything to help the situation."}
{"text":"Although you get a lot of additionals like a special puffy cheese bread and a nice duck confit, the prices are way too high for the quality of the steaks and the service, which could definitely be more friendly. My New York Strip was not as tender as it could have been.  The creamy spinach on the side was delicious, though."}
{"text":"I went to BLT last night. The experience was  excellent. We started with the grilled bacon which I am still dreaming about today. It is grilled bacon with a chimichurri sauce on top. Delicious!  The Ribeye, asparagus, and macaroni and cheese were also good. We finished the night with the banana cream pie. We used a groupon. If you can get one great, but I would go to this restaurant any day without one. It is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very tough steak and mediocre service.  Not what we expected at all.  Beware!"}
{"text":"Started with the crab cake and the bacon for an appetizer. Who woulda thought bacon could taste that good?! The crab cake was meaty and tasty as well.  We went with the ribeye and the lobster. Both were perfectly done and melt in your mouth.  The staff was amazing and Tony is a great server aided by Nelly's attention to detail. Top notch all around."}
{"text":"I've been to what I was told & thought were a few of the best steak restaurants in the country...Until I had the bone in rib eye & food here at BLT Steakhouse! Me & my wife are truly amazed."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed by what used to be our go to steakhouse in Las Vegas.  I decided I wanted to go back to BLT for my birthday dinner this past Tuesday; we have been to BLT three times this past year alone.  I don't know if the recent CET bankruptcy has anything to do with it, but the service and food have taken a huge downturn.  The service was poor - we were left sitting for extended periods of time with absolutely zero attention from anyone.  This was unusual as in all of our past visits, the waiters and bussers were all over the tables and made you feel very special.  As CET Diamond, we received the complimentary appetizers, which have definitely been downsized since this past May.  My special birthday dinner was the Maine Lobster entree - WOW - can't believe they called that an entree.  The shells were huge, but the lobster meat was MAYBE the size of 2 crawfish.  My husband's short ribs (his go to at BLT) were also downsized and extremely fatty.  The side dishes were a joke; $11 for green beans (which was a personal portion), his mashed potatoes were served in a ramiken (about 3/4 cup) for $11!    I gave the extra star for the popovers - which remained as they were.  Well BLT, you ruined it for me!  At least I know this steakhouse will no longer be in the mix of restaurants to chose from!"}
{"text":"Our experience was outstanding and I don't say that lightly as a frequent traveller.  We sat at the bar and the staff was a complete stand out.  We usually eat at the location in Atlanta but the food and staff was a cut above!  Lots of good restaurant options in Las Vegas but the staff made the experience exceptional and that level of genuine service isn't something you can easily find.  Make sure to try the new cauliflower gratin."}
{"text":"This experience was expensive and disappointing. The expectation was high and our party was very underwhelmed. First, we were not offered beverages for about 5 minutes after we were seated. Then when we finally ordered, cut took 10 minutes for just the popovers, and an additional 30 minutes to be served our meal. There was no warning by our waitress that the wait would be so long. Our waitress also went as far to refer to us as \"the regular\" customers when we asked about the party who had a separate menu posted on the wall. She explained that menu was for a \"big shots\" party for chef Ariel. We did not feel like valued customers, we basically took a back seat to the important people. When we finally got our dinner, it was good but not amazing. We had a previous amazing experience at Steak the year before and were expecting the same. We will not be returning the BLT Streak."}
{"text":"I  went out with a group of guys on a Vegas trip and we went to BLT Steak for dinner.  It was at Bally's Casino, so I  wasn't expecting a great meal.  I was wrong.  Everything I had was really quite good.  I had the bone in NY Strip, and beet salad.  They also served some puffy bread after dinner that was pretty good.  I could've eaten many more, but I was getting full.  A few glasses of wine, a big hefty meal, and a bunch of drunk dudes - it keeps the entertainment quotient up.  Our server was very cheery, helpful, and all the guys liked her.    The one thing they need to work on is the decor and vibe.  Right now it's a bit cafeteria like.  I'm exaggerating a little bit, but the atmosphere really keeps this place from getting a top rating from me.  I would definitely go back and check it out again.l"}
{"text":"BLT is a great improvement over the old steak house in Ballys, the atmosphere is very cosmopolitan, the lighting just right, there is a welcoming round bar at the entrance, once seated a chefs sample appears, the service was attentive , food was flawless, but a bit pricey. Expect a $75 per person tab if you have a drink or wine.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Very difficult to find. No clear signage. Took ten minutes for a server to come to our table once we sat down. However it was well worth the wait. David was fantastic and really went above and beyond. 5 stars for service. Tadd was also helping us and he was wonderful as well. Popovers were good, couldent taste the cheese but a lovkey crunch on the outside. Tuna tartar was outstanding. The best i have ever had! Could have eaten that as my entree. I also had the \"bacon\" as an appetizer which, as a canadian, i was offended by what they classafied as bacon. The homemade potatoe chips were to die for. Ceasar salad was good as well although dressing is on the heavier side. Mac and cheese side was good but needed salt. Fries were nice and crispy but could have also used more seasoning. Filet was amazing. Cooked to perfection and seasoned nicley as well. My fathers steak however was very undercooked and had to be sent back. Would come back but not a priority.   Service 5 stars Food 4 stars Ambience 4 stars"}
{"text":"Since when does your waiter literally RUN away from taking your order to help the runner serve salads at his other table. Oh - when you are a table of three and they are a table of 10."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.. Cancelled our Flemimgs reservation so we would not have to drive and had one of the best dinners ever at Ballys where we are staying.  Steak was cooked perfect and well seasoned.  The popovers were awesome.  Dessert was a warm chocolate tort and really finished off the meal. The server was friendly and attentive.  We would absolutely recommend this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Knowing that I wanted a good steak for my birthday, hearing good reviews from friends and constantly seeing promotions, I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The start of the deliciously fulfilling popover-bread to the tomato minestrone soup with chops of savory sausage and some raw oysters began the dinner right. I ordered the \"surf n turf\" of a petite filet with my favorite scallops and my boyfriend ordered the 22oz ribeye oozing with juices and flavor. Our server, Omar M., was attentive and generous to offering us complimentary glasses of champagne and my chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream and cute brownie bites lit with two birthday candles. As for cocktails, order the Bees Knees, our server's choice of drink too, and the Old Cuban. We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Me and the wife ate here randomly and it was amazing. For any couple I'd recommend the porterhouse it's was excellent."}
{"text":"I got dragged along with a bunch of meat eaters.  I would have thought they might have something vegetarian.  Something?   My portion of our $600 bill was a baked potato. Never again."}
{"text":"I had a prime rib steak, and wow it was amazing. It came with bone marrow and that tasted even better! My friends uncle took us and we had a server named Juan, he was a great sever. He was very patient, kind, and informative, I suggest you ask for him. Although the whole staff was nice and attentive, no one there was slacking off. I will not only go back for the mouth dropping food, but also for the amazing staff."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Pancakes, bacon in warm skillets.  Service was great too. We had Daniel as a waiter. Restaurant was a bit drafty but otherwise perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent! Ambience energetic. Lamb was superb. There is a Sommelier. Salmon and steak was excellent. No complaints with good customer service. Only thing is ... pricey... but worth it."}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant five stars - I sat at the bar and there is a great buzz here. I had a cocktail and a glass of wine both were good. To eat I had a fillet steak which was excellent with mushrooms as a side dish. I also had a complementary Popover which I did not really want but it was so good I at it all. Great experience here."}
{"text":"Our family came for dinner and was very pleased with our decision.  Sergio, our waiter, is a great guy-very friendly, professional.  He seemed to enjoy his job interacting with the patrons.   And the food was very good along with the prices. The steaks were perfectly cooked and seasoned with the exceptions of the 2 sides we ordered-onion rings and stuffed mushrooms.  But those were minor compared to the whole eating experience Thoroughly enjoyed the food and service!!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to receive an invite to BLT Steak, the newest restaurant at Bally's Las Vegas. Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.  Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.  The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.  The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.  Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.  Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship. Rumor has it, the Sterling Brunch will return."}
{"text":"The popovers to start are delicious as is the rest of the food. Their seafood is fresh as is the beef they serve. Service is friendly and not typical snooty that you can receive at high priced Vegas steakhouses. You can get a 30% discount for $3 at the half off booths on the strip."}
{"text":"The food and service is A+ Have been coming to BLT at the ritz in Charlotte for 4 years they have not lost a step. Great for dinner!"}
{"text":"This was the Greatest steakhouse experience I have ever had! The service was exceptional and the food was out of this world. Juan and Joseph made our the meal way better by offering us great recommendations.   We had a table of six and everyone received steaks that were cooked to perfection. The Waygu filet was the most succulent piece of meat that I have ever had and don't let the price deter you from having what was the greatest piece of meat on Las Vegas. I really wish I could give this establishment 1,000 stars. It is now a mandatory every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our second time going to a BLT Steak, and may end up being my last. Don't get me wrong, this place makes a decent meal. But for the prices they charge, I don't see the value.  Our trip to Hawaii a few years ago ended with a above-average dinner at BLT Steak. I found the STEAK was the most disappointing part of the meal, and that our server enhanced our experience with offers and explanations of different sauces to try with our meats.  On our recent trip to Vegas, my girlfriend wanted to go back as she had such great memories from Hawaii. Our dinner was nice, but more of the same. We were seated to a quiet, half-empty restaurant and immediately helped out by our server. I wanted to look over the wine list but found a lot of their wine prices were definitely high. Thus I wanted to wait until i had decided on my meal.  The chef sent out complimentary liver pate with a crostini which was tasty and appreciated. Being just the two of us though, I felt bad not eating much of it as we had made room for steak and only steak.  Then the popovers came out. The popovers are delicious and never disappointing. I enjoy that they even share their recipe with you to take home for the brave few who want to try and repeat such success. We got two monsteorus popovers and shamefully ate 1 3/4 of them.  The meal was nice, though it did not have some of the same options they had in hawaii. We settled for a Filet, a parm-herb crusted veal chop, and a truffle mash. The girlfriend enjoyed the filet very much, suggesting it was better than the last steak we had in Hawaii. But she also craved one of the sauces but couldn't remember which one it was. She asked the server, who brought out a peppercorn sauce. It ended up not being the one she had liked but by that point it didn't matter.  My veal chop was nice, but having my first veal chop, it was not at all that I expected. I take responsibility for that, it just seemed very fatty (not tender meat but fat). The real drawback was the parm-herb crust which was so thick and strong I didn't get much flavor for the veal. I cut and chewed and tore at this thing before I finally gave up. Half the parm-herb crust ended up scraped off.  We both enjoyed the truffle mash, sharing it was the perfect choice. It was whipped to an almost cream-like state which was a little strange but it had such a tremendous flavor.  All in all, we got our $170 check for our two entrees, two glasses of wine, side of taters and a $2 charge for the sauce we didn't like (which caught us off guard). Their menu had two prices for everything, adjusting for those with player cards, i believe. Because of all the numbers and the different colors it was hard to figure out what was what, and for the $200 we ended up dropping on this meal I can assure you I wasn't impressed for the money spent. The girlfriend will likely be back but I think this was in turn my last visit to a BLT Steak for some time."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's bday celebration and it was pretty disappointing. The service was slow when there were not even that many tables. Servers were friendly enough but didn't really leave us any impression. We ordered about 4 appetizer dishes; the taste and the presentation were just at average. Most deep fried items had that old oil taste as I was dining at a Chinese restaurant. Steaks were ordered at medium rare but they all turned out to be straight up raw and red. We've been to a lot better steak houses on the strip so this one would never be on list to return again."}
{"text":"This one is tough.  It all depends on what you order.  It's a steak house so if you are going for steak I'd give it 5 stars.  First off, I am not a steak fan and went so my wife could get a really good steak.   She ordered the bone in ribeye and she thought it was great.  Well worth the price. She also like here drink and side.   I ordered the lobster and although it was good was really only worth half the price.  It was pretty small and I left hungry :).  Since I don't like steak that wasn't an option  I am a value guy.  I don't mind spending money if I get value for it.  Well we got value for half the meal.  It just wasn't worth the $275 price tag (with tip).  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly. The sides were also very tasty, but were not sharing sizes like other steakhouses. The bread service was a wonderful cheese filled pop over and was really good. A helpful tip, they have 30 percent discount deals right outside the main entrance of ballys at the tix 4 less booth. Go to this place. Just as good as every other steakhouse on the strip and better prices"}
{"text":"Our experience at BLT Steakhouse was a disappointing, due the waiter we had, I ordered the short ribs and my wife ordered the lobster salad as her entree, the waiter made a the comment ( that's all your going to eat) to my wife in a rather rude tone. I felt his comment was uncalled for to judge what we ordered. He continued to be loud and judgmental. The food was good but the waiters comments were uncalled for. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I literally had the best meal of my entire life at this restaurant.  There isn't an ounce of hyperbole or a misuse of 'literally' here, either.  It was the best meal I have ever put in my face.  The service was spectacular, the food was simply amazing, the ambience is nice, it was clean, hell, it even smelled nice.  I would give this place 6 stars if I could.  I had grilled smoked bacon to start, and a kobe beef steak.  My wife had the tuna tartare and the scottish salmon.  It was all spectacular.  A complimentary duck liver pate was provided as well.  It too was just fantastic.  I suck at writing descriptive reviews, and it makes me a bit sad, because this food deserves better."}
{"text":"Tried BLT Steak for our anniversary this evening. Simply put, some of the best food I've had in Charlotte. I had the Confit rosemary and lemon chicken with creamed spinach. The chicken was amazing! My husband had the ribeye and jalapeño  mashed potatoes, which had the perfect kick of spice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. We had a 6:30 reservation for 4 in advance of a concert whose tickets were a birthday gift for my mother-in-law. Checked in at the hostess stand and were told that the earlier parties were taking a while to settle up. Went back to the hostess 15 minutes later and were indifferently told we were 4th of 4 tables waiting on tables to settle up. Also overheard a server at the bar say to someone that ordered that the wait for food would be an hour as the kitchen was backed up. At that point our only option was to walk to the arena and eat there since my mother-in-law was on crutches and it would take some time to get to the arena. So, we never sat down and because we assumed the restaurant would honor the reservation made we were left with zero other dinner options with the event downtown. Will not be back to BLT Steak - avoid if you can, certainly if you plan an evening here to celebrate."}
{"text":"My colleague and I were staying at the Paris Hotel over the week of March Madness. After watching some of the tournament games at the Ballys sports book we met up with his brother, walked by BLT, and decided to stop in for dinner before going out.  Dinner started with the complimentary duck liver spread and popovers, which I thought were both terrific. I then ordered their asparagus cream soup which I was told was somewhere between a cup and a bowl, our table ordered a few appetizers: onion rings, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and for my main meal I ordered a chicken dish. My colleague ordered a different chicken dish and his brother ordered fish.  The soup came out and it was nowhere near a cup and much bigger than a bowl...too much in my opinion but OK, I appreciate the large portions and I can always stop. The soup was good. It had good flavor but was not as creamy as I would have expected.  Next came the main course and appetizers. First the appetizers: the onion rings were  a soggy, oil saturated disaster. I could only eat one before my body begged me to think twice before continuing lest I end up collapsed in a gutter on the strip in dire need of a triple bypass. The Mashed potatoes and spinach were good but when I tell you the portions were small I am not kidding. The size of a Gerber baby food jar and that is not an exaggeration. I'm an average sized guy, 5'10\" 160lb, and there was no way I was leaving that place satisfied even if I ate everything on the table.  Next came the chicken. The first thing I thought when I saw the portion size was, \"how nice of them, they sent out some complimentary chicken wings.\" Wrong...that was my dinner. There were two pathetic pieces of chicken sitting in a cast iron baking dish. One wing and one leg. Size-wise these would not have made the cut at Hooters. Both had a nice char on the outside and looked OK so I dug in.   Well, it is a very good thing the waitress gave me a heavy, serrated steak knife to cut into them because otherwise I would not have stood a chance. It only took one reluctant bite before I had to call it quits. I had ordered chicken and they obviously made a mistake and served me the Petrified Chicken Jerky that I did not remember seeing on the menu. Waitress please!  This is where a \"two-star\" meal becomes a \"get-me-the-hell-out-of-here\" star meal and easily the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. After explaining to our waitress that there was no way I could eat this meal and showing her how badly over-cooked and inedible it was she apologized and told me she would speak with the manager. A few minutes later she came back and informed me that they would be taking 10% off our check and also taking off the one drink my colleagues brother ordered. I told her that I ate 0% of my entree so it would stand to reason that I should pay for 0% of the entree. My colleague's brother also could not eat his fish because it was rife with bones. Regardless, 10% and that was that. Supposedly there was nothing she could do about that. The order must have come down from great Caeser himself.  Whatever. Since cost was not something we were going to haggle over we just paid our bill and left. On our way out we ran into the manager and he causally asked, \"so gentlemen, how was your meal?\" Well we let him know. It was obvious that he had no idea what had happened and was beside himself and very apologetic. I'm not sure how I felt about that since the waitress claimed that she spoke to the manager (maybe a different manager). Either way there was an obvious disconnect between the waitress, management, and the kitchen. That's a \"high-level\" red flag for me and tells me the place is poorly run.  Now I used to manage a fairly large restaurant myself and I fully understand and expect a kitchen to have an occasional off night. And every once in a while I also expect that I will catch a restaurant on an off night. It's OK, it happens. No need to go running off and writing nasty reviews on Yelp. This place is a steak house and I'm sure (at least I hope) that their steaks are better than their chicken and fish so I will not hang them completely on the food however unacceptable it was.  But, and this is a big one for me, when you are having a bad night and your guests are sending inedible food back to the kitchen you need to step up, accept responsibility and do your best to make it right. This did not happen in this situation and I'm not sure that it does in general at this establishment.  One thing about Vegas is that it is known for the quality of the dining experience. I've had mostly top-level experiences at every restaurant I've been to in Vegas. This was bad...really bad....from beginning to end. Easily below Vegas standards and I can almost guarantee you that any other restaurant you choose would be better."}
{"text":"Seriously run away... Run away because they put a BLT Steak in Bally's. Run away because the service is the worst! I sat at the bar and the two employees have no clue. People being serviced out of order. Mistake after mistake. Hasn't this place been open for over a month? I visit a BLT Steak whenever I am in a city that has one. Hands down... The best cooked steak around. The decor of this place is so bad. Miami is the most beautiful of all the restaurants. The lighting, the colors on the walls, the banquettes... Everything seems off. This could have been amazing! Nothing worse than seeing management standing around. It makes me crazy! My two phrases are... You lean, you leave and you have time to lean, you have time to clean. This could be the first BLT Steak to open and close in the same year. So surprised by the whole experience. Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Javier!  Food was excellent from the first course to the last. We both ordered the Filet and it was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Wow !!!! What an amazing experience ..... Javier was fantastic and very informative on his personal testimony of the food .... Apps were great food amazing and the banana pie ... What!!!!! So good !!! Sommelier was Great she helped us pick the wine for the food we ordered .... I will def be back"}
{"text":"Very sub par. Took an hour and ten minutes between the first ordered appetizers to the main course. The crab legs were insanely over cooked and discolored. And the porter had a weird metallic flavor to the meat either from the cast iron pan or just from searing the bone for too long. Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"Started off poorly. There at 5 so not busy yet we waited several minutes before water or menus. Waiter was a nice guy but just off. Like the kind of guy who calls you 'sport.' My sister liked her crab cake. The seafood plateau was so so. Shrimp was great but crab was small, clams and oysters were not good, too soft. I could see our tray brought out and set down in a hallway with servers looking at a piece of paperSteak sucked. Highly doubt it was USDA Prime, was like a grocery store steak. Emeril's is USDA Prime. Steak was fatty, ordered medium rare but closer to medium. Didn't have a good char crust except for right by the bone. If it weren't for the voucher I'd be pretty pissed."}
{"text":"Great steak restaurant. We hot the rib eye and the filet and both were outstanding. The service was awesome throughout the meal. The crepe soufflé is the star of the meal as it was incredible."}
{"text":"If you want a popover - fine! If you want a steak - go somewhere else. I was tempted to leave it only one star but we have to have leeway for more terrible restaurants, thought that is hard to imagine.  The main complaint: the steak was not quite warm and certainly never got hotter. They serve the steak in what appears to be a cast iron skillet. One would imagine that this could keep the meat at a desirable eating temperature, but not if it was not warmed initially, nor the steak was hot when placed in the skillet. When serving, they place a dab of butter on the steak and ours was so cool that the butter never fully melted, just got limp a bit.  Next, they promote the steak as being prime - I sincerely doubt it. Aside from the sinew running through it, a good portion of it, the fat layer on the outside was much too large. Now, Prime connotes a certain degree of fat, that is what makes it prime, but that is fat that is in the meat, marbling, not a half inch or more around the outside that did nothing to enhance the taste or flavor. It was Saturday night,and they were not busy - with good reason!. There is a discount coupon available at Tix4tonight that will save you 30% (on the food only - shortsighted) and it is still not worth it. The oysters were good, and with the discount reasonable.  I could go on and complain about the service, the creamed spinach and there were some good points, but so over weighed by the bad, that I will not go there - nor should you. ."}
{"text":"Popovers (which I'd never had before) were the tasty start to this wonderful dinner; I had the filet and stuffed mushrooms. I took leftovers home and made a delightful steak sandwich using the remainder of my filet, mushrooms, and a popover. It was a cold sandwich, but lunch that day was nearly as good as dinner was the night before. I'm going back next time I'm in Vegas.  This was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The best filet mignon I have ever had. I've had the filet mignon at Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Smith and Wallensky, McCormick and Schmicks, The Palm.. you get the idea. I've been to all of them and I always order the filet. The filet at BLT is by far the best I have ever had. It was so tender and flavorful, I can't wait to go back to BLT at Bally's in Las Vegas. To start I had the bacon. I thought it was strange to order bacon for an appetizer but I did no wrong. It was like eating a steak but it was bacon!! It was so good and lean and tasty I wish I could get this bacon on a daily basis.  I might have a heartattack at some point if I did but I would die happy. Almost forgot.. As we sat down the waiter brought an amuse bouche which was a duck mousse pate with crackers. It was really nice but my highlight was the bread at the beginning. What a surprise! They call it \"poppers\". It was like eating a croissant but with a hint of cheese. I know when a restaurant is good and will be a great experience when the bread at the beginning is delicious. Let's just say everything else after the bread was just getting better. I don't know how but it did. I was so excited after ordering dessert (apple pie) I couldn't help calling a couple of people to tell them how amazing dinner at BLT was. When the bill arrived our server brought a small free dessert like a chocolate chip brownie bite. I tried one and even that was decadent.  The price at BLT might be a bit expensive (worth every penny) but you do get an little freebie at the beginning and at the end. And that makes up for the price difference between this steakhouse and all the rest not to forget to mention again the quality and flavor in my opinion surpass all other steakhouses. Don't think about it twice... choose BLT, it is amazing food and great service with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had a very nice steak and honeyed Brussel sprouts with bacon at the bar.  Very attentive service.  But the prices cost it one star in my book.  For those prices, I expect perfection, and it wasn't quite that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. They have a limited food menu & all drinks by the glass were half off. Ordered a crab cake ($18) and it came with complimentary popovers. The popovers were amazing!!! The crab cake was just ok but not $18 good."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  The waiter was slack on our drinks and a lady showed up and made sure we were taken care of.  I guess they tag team to insure all get good service.  All the food was prepared correctly.  Mid-rare was correct.  The mushrooms were not over cook or stale as being cook long ago.  I would guess this place cook as fresh as they can.  !!   You will not mess up dining here.  Do check the menu before entering to make sure it is affordable."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, a few years apart, and one thing was consistent: Bad, slow service. We actually had the same waiter both times, and both times he seemed more interested in upselling us things then actually providing good service. When you're in vegas, you don't want to sit around waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for the check. It puts a real damper on the whole experience.   On to the food: liver jelly amuse bouche- Pretty tasty and fun for those that rarely go near liver.  Popovers - Delicious. I could eat these all day. hot and fresh, butter and salt to top it off make it divine.  fresh vegetable salad - Great flavor, and nice portion size. I didn't know what was in the salad, and was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of pieces of avocado and big chunks of feta. The dressing tasted fresh and was delightful. It was a nice item to have before a big hunk of steak.  Filet mignon - Just OK. I got it medium rare, and it was cooked to that temperature. The outside of the steak was really good, with a nice tasty crust. However, the inside was too tough and chewy for filet. I want the steak to be extremely tender at these prices. Ruth's Chris beats this every time, hands down.  I also got the red wine sauce for $2 with the steak. it's lame to me they charge you $2 for a sauce when you're paying $60 for a steak, but whatever, it was still tasty. I recommend the sauce to add a little something to the filet experience.  Bone-in ribeye - my friend had this and was not pleased at all. He is a big steak eater, and said it was overcooked and not very good. I didn't try it, but that was his two cents.  Overall - great salad, great bread, overpriced meh steak, and horrible service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary. We chose BLTs as we have heard good things from friends and also read positive reviews. To summarize, we were not disappointed. Our server was spot on, the food was delicious and the drinks were tasty. Yes, it is expensive, but to celebrate something big it is worth it in my opinion. We were not rushed, we were treated well and left very, very satisfied.  The only thing I probably would not order again was the bacon appetizer, it was good but not great. My wife had a veal chop that was hand picked by the chef (she called ahead as they did not have one on the menu) , this was an amazing service offering as this is one of her favorite cuts. I had the 12oz filet, cooked to perfection and mouth watering. We had the mushrooms and the brussel sprouts on the side. They brought several \"on the house\" small plates during our experience.  All in a fabulous experience and I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas in the search for best steak tartar.  When I ordered it the waitress asked me if I know that it's raw meat chopped up to which I replied \"yes, hence its called tartare\".  Dish looked pretty good with the typical presentation...some greens on top and toasted bread on the side.  I have to say that the tartare itself was grrrreat, I did however send the bread back as it was cold and chewy.  At the end of the meal I ordered the chocolate peanut butter mousse- there was nothing moussey about it, it was dry, not smooth - very disappointing. I think the waiter knew something was up when I left the big piece almost untouched , but he didn't dare asking . At the end waiter did take the mousse off my bill"}
{"text":"The popovers were a great start to a delicious meal! Everything was cooked to perfection. My wife had the lobster which was excellent, according to her one of the best she's ever had.. Our only complaint is that the staff was a little \"stuffy\"... lighten up, you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best unbeatable Sterling Brunch on Sunday's.  Unlimited Caviar, crab legs, lobster tails, sushi, waffles, prime rib, dessert, lamb, you name it.  Classy amazing Perrier Jouiet until 3pm w/ great friends.  What a way to start any week.    I have eaten here regularly for years now w/ a dear girlfriend of mine & we can't ever get past the plate of caviar.  It is worth every bite of whatever your heart desires in this Brunch.  I can honestly say that there is none that I've ever been to that compares.    Lawerence, Laurel, we miss Warren, & New to us Char you are all fabulous.  The best."}
{"text":"Tony and the entire team at BLT steak are terrific.  The service Amazing and the food excellent."}
{"text":"Dinner at BLT Steakhouse in Bally's was very good. On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it about an 8.5.  The Service - Top notch service. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. At no time were we having to wait for something. The hostess was especially nice.  The Environment - Beautiful restaurant, dark and romantic. A little on the noisy side, but nothing that was an issue.  The Appetizers - I had the Spinach Salad which was spectacular and my wife had the Caesar Salad which she said was very good. They also bring you Cheese Popovers that are extraordinary. The popovers even come with a little card that has the recipe. Nice touch. Prior to the popovers, the waiter brought a little taste from the kitchen, which was a duck liver mousse with a jelly topping. The mousse was amazing.  The Entree - I had the Filet, which was cooked perfectly, but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. It was good, but not great. My wife had the Tuna Tartare as her entree and she loved it. She said it was the best she's ever had.  The Drinks - I had a Johnny Walker and Soda and it was STRONG!!!!  We did not have dessert, too full, but the dessert selection was good.  Overall the restaurant was very good. I'm a big steak fan, but I like bolder flavors, so I would probably not order a steak next time we come, but my wife will definitely order the tuna again."}
{"text":"Food was alright. They gave us a burnt ribeye. The bread was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, we were a little aprehensive about going to a steakhouse in Las Vegas.  Almost immediately, our aprehension disapeared and turned into excitement.  The restaurant was very nice and elegant.  It was a little dark at first but our eyes adjusted quickly and it became apparant that BLT takes pride in their restaurant.  We spent the next few minutes admiring the decor and layout.  We were greeted by Leslie and Conrad (a great team I might add), and the experience just got better.  Conrad went to filling drinks while Leslie took the time to explain the menu and make suggestions (with no pressure).  All we can say is....WOW!  These two made an amazing team and really took care of us; and to be honest, even if the food was just good - because of them we would still come back.  Now to the food, they started us out with a couple popovers, then followed by pâté.  Shortly after that we had our mixed drinks (Old Cuban's, which are kind of like a hybrid between a Mojito and a Long Island, very good!).  The popovers were nothing short of amazing (and they give you the recipe!) and the pâté made me want to move in.  I know it sounds bad but I wouldn't let go of the dish it came in until it was clean (no REALLY).  Next, we split a delicious salad, while still being pampared by Leslie and Conrad.  Finally came the steak (the Porterhouse for 2).   It was perfectly cooked (medium is our preference) and already sliced for sharing.  We also got two sides, truffle potatoes and stuffed mushrooms, both are a must!  At the first bite, we were hooked!  After all that food, we still finished all 36 mouthwatering ounces.  For dessert, we were too full so they brought us two amazing little brownies that satisfied our dessert cravings.  We cannot recommend BLT Steak enough!  It is already on our return list for next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the BLT. The porterhouse for 2 was grilled to perfection, tender and a great tasting cut of beef. The sides were very tasty. The service was  great. Our server Juan took very good care of us. There was a gentleman with a Barry White voice refilling our drinks and clearing the table, this made the night perfect. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday at 530pm.  The restaurant was pretty crowded shortly after we were seated (we had reservations).  Ordered the Travelzoo deal.  This is a steal, basically 50% cost, for $420 worth of food/drinks.  We had four of us and had a hard time spending $420, without buying a bottle of wine.  It is enough for drinks, apps, salads, dinners, desserts for everyone (two of us did share a porterhouse).  All in all, the food was solid.  Nothing was super amazing or life changing, but everything was as expected for a steakhouse at that price point.  I did not leave disappointed.  I am not sure I would have paid full price for the meal, as I think there could be better meals for less cost, but with the deal it was great.  The popovers are famous and for good reason.  I could get full off of those alone.  I would probably give 3 stars for the porterhouse, as it was actually a little cold when we got it (like it had been sitting), even though it was on a \"hot plate\".  Everything else I would give a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas Eve dinner here. We ordered the 36 oz steak to share between my daughter, my wife and I. We ordered it medium-well. Some bits were charred a little more than we would have liked, but it was good. My son had the  bone in ribeye. He swears it was the best. It was a nice dinner."}
{"text":"We did the Travelzoo voucher and what a great deal. All of the food and drinks were great and the service was even better. You can share the sides because they are rather large portions. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the weekend to see a concert so went there with a few friends.  The restaurant looks great and the service was also great.  We had Hugo who has worked there since the beginning and provided great service and recommendations.  To start, we got amazing bread and butter and duck liver pate.  Not sure what it was actually called but was very smooth and tasty.  Cocktails were also great, had two old Cubans and mojitos.  They were strong and the different flavored stood out.  For our entree each couple shared their signature steak - a rib eye on a cast iron with garlic, butter, and thyme.  We also shared the lobster and a few sides.  Presentation was great, the only reason this place doesn't get the 5th star is because the steak was flavorful but was slightly tough and not as marbled as I would have hoped.  Still a darn good steak but I expected (and hoped) it would be perfect.  The only other reason is that it did not seem like a 2lb lobster.  There was not enough meat in it at all - each of us had one good bite and it was gone.  Overall a great 4-star experience.  Would probably try other steak houses next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had! Everything started great. Excellent amuse, great pop overs and great salad too but when it came to the porter house it was terrible! I'm a chef and have worked in several high end steak houses as the broiler chef. This porter house $96 would have never been served at any establishment I have ever been to or worked for. The steak was cut before it was cooked because the waiter forgot to ring it in so they cheated and it came out terrible. We told the waiter nicely and he told his manager. We waited and ate around the raw (not rare, raw) meat while waiting. We had a show to get to and couldn't wait another 30 minutes for another steak.He came over 20 minutes later and gave us a 20 percent discount? We didn't even eat 20 percent of the steak!  We were very disappointed and believe Gordon Ramsey is a fake. There are many other places to dine on the strip but will never waste our time in another one of your restaurants."}
{"text":"Showed up for our reservation and were told we would have to wait for 2 hours. In 51 years this has never happened to me. Is there anyway to explain this since we were there at 10:30 a.m.? Help me understand this please."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and expected a better tasting filet for the price. Absolutely no seasoning. This is a \"so so\" steak house. The filet was tender but again had no taste. My dinner was disappointing -- nothing special. Will I return ?? - No. Can't wait to get back to Fort Worth and Double Eagle Del Frisco's so far my favorite place for a fabulous tasting steak."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and it didn't hurt that as diamond members we received complimentary amuse-bouche and mignardise. The popovers were pretty good--hot bread is always welcome. We ordered the intimidating 36 oz porterhouse and lamb chops both medium rare. Unfortunately the porterhouse arrived blue rare while the lamb chops arrived rare. The sides were a joke. At $12 at other steakhouses, a side is usually pretty generous, but the stuffed mushrooms were tiny and only came with 5 and were honestly kind of gross. The truffle mashed potatoes had oil leaking from them, was overseasoned in a tiny cast iron pot, maybe half a cup of mash. If the sides were more generous and the meats cooked properly we would definitely have returned as the quality was there. Maybe it was an off night?"}
{"text":"Just an average steak house.    Service was good and the wine selection was nice.  Omar is definitely the jewel of this place.  Supposedly everyone loves the popovers, I wasn't impressed at all.  They tasted burnt and salty.  The duck liver mousse was good though.  I lied to my friend so he would try it.  If we weren't in public I think he would have spit it out!  My friend was disappointed because they don't serve prime rib but he managed and was happy with his steak.  My filet was salty and not the best meat for what they charged.  I didn't even finish it and I love red meat.  Drew loved his steak and the bone marrow.  The side dishes were good too.  Try the Brussels sprouts with bacon and honey.  So good!  The Mac and cheese was good, which isn't on the main menu.  Highlights...easy to get into, casual atmosphere, good service. Low points....better steak places for the money"}
{"text":"I HAVE ONE WORD! YUMMMMMMMMMMMNMMMMMMM  That was literally the same word I said every time I took a bite of my short rib!!!!!  I have never experienced such fabulous flavors all coming together to create the perfect short rib.  My husband had the filet mignon and said it was the best he has ever had!! Everything is a la cart so we also added the whipped mashed potatoes. And your meal will come with a homemade pop overs. (Included in your meal). They are just like your remember having from your mother if you've had popovers before.......Soft- buttery and big! They bring you a jar of sea salt to top it off with. interesting taste to an already fabulous pop over!!!  My short rib was $42 his filet mignon was $62 and the potatoes were another $12. More or less.... we also shared banana ice cream for dessert and it was $10! Everything was absolutely fabulous I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas and indulge in what I consider to be the best steakhouse in Vegas.... even though I was full after the meal I suggested we go back and eat there on our last day in Vegas. That's how good it was.!!! This restaurant is located inside of Bally's towards the back where it connects to Paris with the shops!  Reservations highly recommended and dress is Business casual. The wait staff service -was impeccable. Eager to please.  (The only thing that would make this restaurant any better was if it was sitting on the strip!!! ( no views ) )  Enjoying a-quiet relaxing evening having one of the best steaks you'll ever have. !!!!!!!!!! ENJOY!  You'll have to check to see if they validate parking if you're coming from outside at Bally's... when you make your reservation."}
{"text":"Ate here Sunday night-- it was a memorable meal! Dining solo has its challenges and I appreciated the attentive service. I've eaten at some really great restaurants and I'd put this on the list . Not sure what the negative reviews are-- but please don't let them deter you if you like a great steak. I had the ribeye, broccolini and a spinach salad. No room for dessert! Loved having a glass of Nebbiolo wine--not commonly found. Paired well with meal."}
{"text":"VERY, VERY GOOD!!! Let me start by saying we came to BLT with a Travel Zoo certificate ~  upon check in the host asked for the certificate. We were seated and our server, Leon greets our table, confirms the Travel Zoo, then says don't concern yourselves with the restrictions just order whatever you'd like and the TZ certificate will apply! That was a great way to start our dining experience for sure!   We all started with cocktails, 2 martinis, a Jameson rocks & for me a Manhattan....... Mine was EXCELLENT SERVED ICEY COLD W/ a splash of cherry juice = PERFECTION!!! The Toni's came with Blue Cheese olives always a nice touch.     The filet (10 oz) the smallest available unless you want Kobe.... Just DEEELISSH, cooked medium was tasty not over seasoned you know seared on the outside and beautiful pinkish red on the inside.       A nice change of pace are the Humongous muffins they serve before dinner instead of bread ~ these things are served hot out of the oven & are FAB!! We ordered traditional sides loaded baked potatoes, green beans & asparagus ~ all were prepared al Dente except the potatoes & with a touch of butter.      Couldn't have asked for a better steak meal ~ NOT one misstep, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you check out BLT inside Bally's you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a fabulous meal!  I had the fillet; one of the best I've ever had. It was well seasoned, with a fabulous herb butter. The popovers were absolutely something special!!! Next time in Vegas, I will make a b-line for this place!"}
{"text":"I came here and sat at the bar which had a full menu. I wasn't sure what to expect as the restaurant was fairly new. The bartenders were very friendly and professional and once I informed them that I would be dining that night, they set up a full spread for service. I ordered after having a cocktail and they sent out the popper which was quite good. Chef also sent out a complimentary appetizer which was also very good. The shrimp cocktail that I ordered came out timely and was delicious. Between courses my water glass was constantly filled with great service from the staff.   My main course was the Maine grilled lobster which was excellent. I ate it all with a loaded baked potato - very good. Chef sent out a comp dessert which put me over the top. I would eat here again for the lobster but I would likely try more steakhouses if craving beef. Overall it was an excellent high end dining experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding Everything about this restaurant is perfect. The ambience, the service and the food are all superior. If you are looking for a fine dining experience come here.    We each had a different entree and all of them were served exactly as we had ordered them. The servers all had expert knowledge about the food and were honest in their advice.  Popovers were served as the bread and I have never had any that compared to these. Although it is a steak house every other entree was the best too.  It is pricy but you will be happy you chose this restaurant."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, but food was ok. Steak was ok, and the mac m cheese are super salty!!' Price was too high"}
{"text":"I went to BLT Steak for the second time tonight. My friend and I had a great experience! Our waiter was funny and attentive. The manager, Warren, was super friendly and it's obvious that he cares about his guest's experience!  My friend is a big fan of Hell's Kitchen and said the winner works as a chef here as a prize from the show. She was working tonight, taking pictures with fans and talking to them. It seemed like a cool experience for fans of the show.   I ordered the filet mignon and added lobster for $20. I wasn't a big fan of the lobster but the steak was great! For sides we ordered Mac & cheese, stuffed mushrooms and a loaded baked potato. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious! I almost didn't order them but I'm so glad I did! My favorite was the French Onion Soup, which was a special for the night. I'm a big fan of French onion soup and I have to say, this was the best I've ever had!  We were so full that we didn't order dessert but we were given brownie bites at the end of our meal. It was the perfect size!"}
{"text":"2nd trip here. Really like the food, don't care for the kinda ....cafeteria like atmosphere? It may just be me, but the food is great The duck liver mousse deal is still as good as I remembered. Started with quail and foie ( I cannot express in words how good this was) the popovers - bread lover here, thank you! Rib eye- perfect and creamed spinach. Cocktails are tasty and really liked our server- truthfully the quail/foil and our server made it 4 stars, otherwise would give it 3"}
{"text":"BLT Steak is a modern American steakhouse at Bally's Las Vegas. Definitely be sure to join the Total Rewards program (which several of the Las Vegas casinos are a part of, and is free to join) because you get a discount on many food items if you are a member. Service here was excellent. Very friendly server who was able to answer any questions we had about the food and explained how the steaks are dry aged and cut. Had oysters as a starter which were very good. They serve the oysters as a 50/50 split of East Coast and West Coast oysters, and are served as expected on ice with the typical accompaniments like lemon and horseradish. They do popovers here for bread, which were good. The chef also sent out a duck liver pate with crostini which was very good. For steak, I went with a medium-rare filet mignon. The steaks are thick here. They get a nice sear on the outside and the meat remains juicy and flavorful on the inside. They do put a small piece of seasoned butter on top when serving, too. This was one of the best filet mignons I have had. Side items here are done a la carte and are adequate to serve two people. There was a crab macaroni and cheese dish that was a special, and it was very good. The one slight disappointment here was on the glass of Malbec that I ordered, which fell short of expectations but was still a good wine."}
{"text":"We were at BLT for a belated 21st birthday celebration for my daughter and could not have asked for a better dinner!  Three of us had the 10 oz filet and one had the bone in strip, all with different levels of \"doneness.\"  Every single steak was cooked to perfection and so tender!  I am super picky about how my beef is prepared.  Recently graduated from well done to medium well, knowing that most chefs usually do a medium when preparing my order.  It was medium well, and we all were amazed at how simply flavorful it was.  There are several different choices for sauces.  We either ordered the red wine sauce or the peppercorn sauce.  I loved the peppercorn sauce.  Thought it wes the perfect compliment.  To start I had the butternut squash soup which was delicious.  The sommelier picked out a beautiful Malbec - a 2013 Luca.  She was awesome, and took her time answering questions and doing some teaching.  She was really sweet!  As everything is a la cart, we each ordered a different side: loaded baked potato, mac and cheese, potato skins, and green beans. Everyone was very happy wtth their choices.  We were too full for dessert, unfortuately. Let's talk about our waiter, ok?  Leon was freaking AMAZING!  He helped make the meal even better.  Attentive without being overbearing.  My best friend and 2 daughters were with me, and he put up with us in great form, joining in on our fun while we were still keeping it classy.  He bought my 2 daughters shots, the birthday girl a cute little dessert (tiny brownie bites) with a candle, and brought the 4 of us each a glass of champagne.  You would be so lucky to be seated in his section.  He truly looked like he was enjoying every minute of his job with all his tables.   All that being said, it was a very expensive dinner, so for us, it was an extravagance we couldn't do very often, but well worth it.  I would definitely come here again and would not change one single thing.  Welllllllll......we could've done without the second bottle of wine.  We ended up corking it and bringing it back to the hotel since we knew if we finished it, we would indeed be finished!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoyed my dinner sitting at the bar, it was an awesome experience. I enjoyed the filet mignon with the lobster option. It was divine! At my request, my steak was prepared medium well but I probably should have taken the bartender's recommendation for medium. However, it was still very tender and delicious. To drink, I had the Old Cuban who included dark rum and other mixture. It was cool. I actually enjoyed a few of them.  I would recommend this place again because it exceeded my expectations. All three bartenders made me feel really special with the level of customer service they provided. I would definitely visit the restaurant again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent steak dinner and restaurant. The staff was above average from the moment the hostess greets you till the moment you leave. Our waiter (Jonathan) was very friendly, provided excellent recommendations, and answered all our questions with fine detail. Was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The filet mignon and bone - in strip were both superb - very juicy, tender, and almost melt in your mouth, with a buttery-pepper crust that is inexplicable. Mashed potatoes were very creamy with just the right portion for two people to share; asparagus was also done impeccably well. Pop-overs were provided to the table with butter and sea salt to top off. Food was delightful and tasty in all accounts.  Overall, wonderful dinner, excellent staff and great environment. Highly recommend to all looking for a great steak house. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"POPOVERS...at BLT Steak are so Delicious!. They even give you the Recipe to make at Home- an Extra Treat!  We had Wonderful Appetizers like the Tuna Tartare, Crabcakes and of course some Wine. Dinner was Exceptional with Generous Portions. The General Manager Lawrence was very Accomodating and made sure we were Pleased. Tammy was Helpful, Informative and Did a Fantastic Job making everything look so Pristine and Organized. Thank you for a Wonderful Evening at BLT Steak- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went last night for dinner with my sister and father. The service was quick and the food was wonderful. I had the filet mignon medium well which melted in my mouth just the outside was a little burnt. The mashed potatoes and the creamed Spinach were very tasty. Overall a good dinner service and very attentive customer service."}
{"text":"Steak was not the best but staff were great. Mushrooms and drinks were awesome.  Bar staff worth the visit, but skip the steak."}
{"text":"I actually ate here twice this week. Found it by accident on Monday night when I was just looking for someplace to grab a steak.  Had plans to take nine customers to dinner at another steakhouse on the strip the next night, but was told by coworkers that they had been there the night before and were not impressed.  So...... I switched our Tuesday reservation to BLT after enjoying a great steak on Monday night. We started out with \"Popovers\"  Most of the group had one, while I passed on the bread.  After looking at everyone else eating this stuff, I broke down and grabbed one.  I will say that it was an experience that I will never forget! :)  I next had a Caesar Salad which was huge.  Delicious and just the right amount of dressing, not over bearing.  I had the New York Strip (for the second night in a row), which was perfectly cooked medium rare along with some really crispy green beans.  I am a steak sauce kind of guy, but the melting butter on the top of the steak made my desire for A-1 (or the BLT sauce) completely unnecessary. Most of us ate steak, although one had the Sea Bass.  Everyone was impressed. If you are a wine drinker, you will love their wine list.  We drank plenty of red and white, enough to Impress Brenda and Eddie and Billy Joel.  The dinner staff at BLT was amazing.  I made sure to get all of their names because I was so impressed and didn't want to not acknowledge their awesomeness.  Our waiter, Mario and Busser, Jamie were constantly there to check on us and keep our glasses full.  It seemed like they always knew when we needed something and they timed it perfectly.  The Manager on duty, Char was gracious and went out of her way to make sure that we had everything we wanted (and we did), It seemed like a well oiled machine.  They make up a great team! Bottom line is, I love this place!  May even try to get over there again before I leave town.  I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"In a word: incredible. I wasn't expecting much from this steakhouse, tucked away in Bally's without a celebrity chef or known brand. But they really, really deliver. Cozy atmosphere, excellently executed menu, top-notch service.  POPOVERS: A fun version of the usual free bread service, these are delightfully airy with a crisp exterior. They're served with fresh Vermont butter and salt, and you even receive a small card with the recipe. I'll just come back instead of trying to make these myself. DUCK LIVER PATE: A complimentary dish served to every table, this was served in a small jam jar with two small slices of bread. I like how the richness of the pate was balanced with the sweet jelly on top. An indulgent start to the meal that raised my expectations for the kitchen.  STEAK TARTARE: It's not the best version I've had on the Strip, but it is delicious! A traditional preparation, plated with nicely crisp country bread, this is a great starter if you don't mind a  steak app before a steak dinner. BURRATA: A heap of deliciously creamy yet mild mozzarella, surrounded with toy box tomatoes and accented with basil seed vinaigrette and basil leaves. Save your popovers to devour this. Add a touch of the salt from the butter, too. ROASTED BEETS: Everyone has this on their menu these days, but BLT's comes as a salad with apple, french green beans, gorgonzola, and walnuts. BF called this the best version he's had. BONE-IN RIB EYE: This was heaven. Cooked and served in cast-iron, it has a thick crust and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare. The fatty bites right next to the bone are the best part, and this is served with the marrow, a tempura-fried onion ring, and a whole roasted garlic bulb. Easily one of the best steaks I've had, and at a shareable 22oz and a wallet-friendly price. After taking the first bite, BF and I knew we would be coming back. GRILLED LOBSTER: This is a $20 supplemental, and well worth it. Generous portion, served atop the steak, sweet and tender. I'm usually not much of a lobster fan, but I'm glad we decided to add this on. TRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES: Despite all the rave reviews, this didn't go over so well with us. We like truffle-accented dishes, and we like potatoes, but something about this dish just didn't work. Good, smooth texture but it's the only thing on the table we didn't finish. MANCHEGO WHITE GRITS: Wow. After leaving the south, it's been difficult to find great grits. Well, here they are, perfectly accented with a tasty green chile relish. I couldn't have asked for better. BROWNIE BITES: We were too full to order an actual dessert, but were presented with this complimentary plate, and it's perfectly sized for just a hint of sweetness after the meal.   I feel like I can't fully express what a great find this is- apparently others are catching on, because the dining room was packed on a casual Wednesday evening. I recommend making a reservation if you plan to drop in during dinner hours.   Snag a Groupon while they're still up ($100 credit for $70), the discount is appealing but totally unnecessary to make me return- the food alone is enough to make this a strong and frequent recommendation when seeking a nice steak dinner on the Strip."}
{"text":"My 3rd time at BLT steakhouse tonight.  Nothing short of spectacular!  Chilean Sea Bass cooked to perfection.  My son said his NY Strip Steak was the best he's ever had.  Service was great and everything was delicious!!!  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful food! We love the popovers, Wagyu skirt steak, Brussel sprouts, and BBQ corn. It is all AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service went for a first date staff made it memorable. The food was perfectly prepared and glass never touched the table empty not once."}
{"text":"We were served a goose liver amuse bouche which was nice. The creamed spinach was delicious. As were the potatoes gratin. The pop overs were savory and came with a small recipe book. Delightful. The lobster and shrimp salad appetizer was refreshing.  However the star of the show... the \"Wagyu\" Ribeye disappointed. The \"Wagyu\" was tough and flavorless even though we ordered it medium rare.  Probably won't go again."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down considerably since that Hell's Kitchen chef came in and thinks she's suddenly a steakmaster after three months of battling a bunch of nobodies. I really don't care what Gordon Ramsay thinks, this place does not have steak that's worth the ridiculous price tag that it comes with. If you really think Gordon Ramsay is some sort of god anyway, just go to his pub and grill nearby, it's a lot better for a lot less."}
{"text":"A steakhouse can not deliver quality steak, which is unacceptable.  Part of the steak was made carbonized, barely edible.   Although the manager took the steak from the check, but the dinner and the whole night were ruined.  Just so disappointed."}
{"text":"Very overpriced Steakhouse! We were 4 and had three ribeye wagyus and a 22 oz regular ribeye which were too fatty and not quite thick nor tasty enough for $92 apiece. Not enough \"mouth feel\" for a wagyu! And wine recommendation was flat with a Gallo Cabernet for $85! Try lowering the prices to be realistic. That bottle of wine was mediocre and cost less than $20 retail. A real rip off! Atmosphere = none. For these prices ( nearly $600 b4 tip) I expected much more! Many other steakhouses downtown especially the \"D\" and the steakhouse at Palace Station ( Charcoal room) are a much better value!"}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants in Charlotte.  The food was amazing as well as the service.  We went here as part of an office party, so we were able to sample many items on the menu during our first visit.  First, the bar is really nice and makes great drinks pre-dinner.  We sampled several items at the bar...the charcuterie plate was very nice.  When we arrived at the table we had several appetizers...the tuna tartare was absolutely amazing and the shrimp cocktail was one of the best I've ever had.  For dinner we sampled many things...the short rib was the best thing we had.  The ribeye was a close second.  I would return just for the short rib.  Dessert was not memorable but nothing bad stands out.  Great wine selection, ambiance, service, etc.  If you're thinking about going here...do it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now my favorite in Las Vegas. Everything was perfect, from the food to the service. The appetizers they bring you are outstanding, especially the duck and jam pate.  My short ribs were amazing and my husband's bone in rib eye was so tender that he didn't need a knife. A special kudos to Tracy, the manager and Sergio who was our server. Rarely do I take the time to post on yelp but this place was so excellent!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried BLT after a recommendation. We had one of the best dinners ever. The service, atmosphere and food were on point.  Thanks to the excellent staff. Margo is awesome!We will be back."}
{"text":"For me, this place is just okay.  The service was top notch! The waiter was attentive and informative. He really knew the menu and offered some great suggestions.   I came for Restaurant Week and ordered the wedge salad, hanger steak with garlic butter and chocolate and peanut butter mousse with banana ice cream.   The chef's compliment popovers were very good! These were such a nice treat.They were so light. The perfect way to start the meal!  The salad was good. It was a classic wedge with bacon,tomatoes,blue cheese, and iceberg lettuce. The gorgonzola vinaigrette dressing is a little heavy - but overall it was a good choice.   The hanger steak was fine. I ordered it medium well and it came out as requested, but I just didn't love it. It was a little fatty and I could have used a pinch more seasoning. I will say that the garlic butter was a nice touch. But I think if I dined here again I'd pass on ordering this dish. However, I did enjoy the crispy potatoes. They were even better dipped in a little of the  BLT steak sauce.  The best part of the meal was the chocolate peanut butter mousse. It was so good! I'm glad it's a part of their regular menu so you can order it any time.   Highlights of the night for me were:  - Service  - Popovers - Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse  Tip! They valet at the Ritz. So no need to worry about where to park!"}
{"text":"First time here the dinner was good except the onions rings to soft inside ! The rib eye was very tender the chicken was good with the sauce! The green beans was little salted and finally the shorts Ribs the meat just fall off is almost like pull pork !! Service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Steak was just ok. Waiter was not on top of his game- giving him benefit of doubt and say perhaps it was his first day at the job."}
{"text":"Steak was unbelievable as well as bread and cream spinach. Lupe was very nice and attentive. Certainly will return!"}
{"text":"BLT Steak is by far the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, which is why my husband & I so often frequently dine here.  The popovers are delicious and start off the dinner just right. A few of my favorite appetizers are the burrata/tomato salad and also the tuna tartare. You can't go wrong with any entree option, but I always love getting the American Wagyu Filet Mignon. YUM!  To finish off with the desert, get the banana cream pie. You'll thank me later! :-)  Not only is the food the best you can get in Las Vegas, the service is impeccable. The GM, Lawrence Silva, leads a great team that executes top notch service to their guests."}
{"text":"Went there on 8/2/16 , the atmospheric was great and the food was amazing. Then the Chef Ariel came out and chatted with us and even took pics. Absolutely a great time and a must visit"}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner at BLT STEAKHOUSE, it was definitely the icing on the cake for our Vegas Vacation. We purchased a Travelzoo deal, and man was it a deal. Leslie was our server for the evening and she provided excellent customer service from the beginning to the end. The food was delicious, we will definitely be back to BLT Steakhouse!!"}
{"text":"Good golly Miss Molly!!! We arrived late afternoon in Las Vegas & checked into Bally's. We tried to get reservations at one of our fav restaurants, but they were booked until late in the evening. We didn't feel like making a huge deal of the evening, so popped into the BLT Steakhouse & got a wonderful little table. Our entire experience was 5 star. Lupe was our wonderful server. She was attentive & very professional. She started us off with \"popovers\" that were yummy. They included a small recipe card. Our Sommelier Dustin was amazing! Don't know how he earned the designation at such a tender age? Wow! Our steaks & sides were mouthwatering. BLT certainly deserves it's REP!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Pleasantly surprised having known about this a la carte steakhouse for many years.    Pretty flawless experience.  My mom and I had a hundred dollar credit.    No one could dine with us and we are light eaters.  Decided to splurge at the steakhouse.   The steaks were a bit pricey even for a la carte, but the filet was a large 10 oz only, so we ordered one and split it w a side of mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese.  We also ordered the spinach bacon salad.    We were presented with a compliments of the house bite size appetizer and then was presented with a charcuterie plate of four meats and a duck pate for our diamond status.  We were not expecting this and would have saved for desert instead of sides and salads.  But very good and very nice.   I didn't like the duck pate at all.  I am sure it was very nice though.  Lol.    Steak was excellent, albeit we ordered medium and it was very medium rare (which made me happy anyway, not the mother).     The sides were both very tasty, although on the small side for $12.  If we were not light eaters, they were not sharable, which is entirely too pricey.   Mashed and Mac are just mashed and Mac after all.    The only main criticism would be the salad it was a fail.  It needs removed from menu.  The Flavors were not there, the dressing was nonexistent.  The flavors came from the very good, but bulky and almost jerky like chewy inch squares of bacon and the also very good when you had some blue cheese.   However, eating some jerky bacon before a nice steak kind of defeats the purpose of a smooth steak.  We had decided we had entirely too much food anyway and had them box it for my husband.  It was edible, but paired poorly and executed poorly.    Ahh, forgot the popovers.  We were also served two huge hot and fresh popovers before the salad.     Drinks were filled continuously, yet no staff were overbearing.  Plates were cleared and table was kept timely and throughout.     Honestly, for a very good quality meal and a lot of meal we were at $100 for two people.  Although again we ordered one entree by design.   We would never eat two steaks and still brought half of one home for my husband.  I would actually recommend or return to this steakhouse again if needing to entertain or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great service. Wagyu ribeye was tasty! Love the bread. That smoky bacon appetizer was great but dangerous ;-)"}
{"text":"We at an early dinner here yesterday. We went in at 5:25 (they open at 5:30). Staff was very accommodating. The atmosphere was very nice. The restaurant is connected to the Ritz Carlton hotel. We were given complimentary chicken pate and bread. It got rave reviews from my dinner party. They also brought out bread called, Poppers. The bread was very fluffy and airy. I enjoyed it. I ordered a 14 once ribeye and baked potato. The potato was huge and we split it between 2 people. I ordered a cocktail named Valet Service. It was pretty good also. One thing that we noticed was how ALL the wait staff helped. We had our main waiter, but the whole staff lended a helping hand. Towards the end of our dinner, we got complimentary dessert. It was 3 cookies. I forgot the name of them. My son enjoyed them. I ordered a Crepe Soufflé. Amazing!!!!!! We will definitely come again when we visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well, this has been on the bucket list for quite some time, as a high quality, well known restaurant in Charlotte. My usual budget doesn't allow for splurging here, but Restaurant week provides the perfect opportunity - 3 courses for $35.00. Though the menu is much shorter, still sign me up!  I realize there aren't too many reviews or photos (probably because it's such a class place) but I managed to still take some photos that I will use for my blog so hopefully they will be helpful!  For the starters, I got the cauliflower risotto (though dont' be fooled - the risotto is not made of cauliflower, just has some charred cauli on top, which I thought was a bit deceiving), and the hubby got the butternut squash soup. I found the risotta to be really delicious, creamy and a perfect touch of milk/cheese flavor.   I had the salmon for my entree, which was beautifully presented. It came with cous cous and some chopped kombucha squash. This was good, but sadly, I think the salmon could have been a little more flavorful and seasoned. It was a bit dry to me. Still, a great piece of fish so I was happy to eat it as is, but I think flavor would have been a great addition. My husband had the hanger steak. We have had BAD hanger steak in the past and have been hesitant to order since, because it takes knowledge to cook it well - otherwise it's often chewy and bland, like the last one was. BLT knows their steak though, obviously, because this steak was more than flavorful and so tender, not chewy. It came with french fries (seasoned with parsley maybe?), which were perfectly crisp and delicious. This was the winner here.  For dessert, we both got the peanut butter chocolate mousse, which needs to description. Peanut butter + chocolate = heaven. And the texture was perfect - so moist. Plus, accompanied with ice cream to soak it all up.  If BLT were more in my price range, I\"d be a regular! But definitely a great place to try during restaurant week, Charlotteans!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Travelzoo voucher for this steakhouse that i thought was a killer deal. Dinner for 2 with drinks for 99 bucks. It Included entrees up to $58, plus an appetizer or salad each and a shared side along with shared dessert. In all honestly, if i hadn't paid with the voucher and instead ponied up full price for this meal i would have been pissed. First off, when i go to a steakhouse that charges nearly 60 dollars for their top cuts, then it had BETTER be sublime. This one was not. I had the supposed 28 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was too fatty, too bland, and NOT worth the 60 dollar price tag. Are you kidding me? Anyone here that tells you that simply has no idea what they are taking about. And they certainly don't know a great steak when they taste one. Geesh. I have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in town, and this place (at least as far as the steak) falls way short. I will say this: The service was good, and so was the ambiance. But i cannot recommend this place because the showcase item (the steak), was simply just average. Here are some of the other places in town that i have eaten at. Jean George's (Aria), Strip Steak (Mandalay bay), Del Frisco's Double Eagle, Golden Steer, Chop (Red Rock), Vic and Anthony's (Golden Nugget). Each of them topped BLT as far as steak goes."}
{"text":"The Travelzoo deal for dinner for 4 for $225 at a restaurant so well reviewed on Yelp seemed almost too good to pass up. The restaurant is at the far end of the casino away from the valet parking area, but not hard to find.  Service: almost as soon as we sat down we were greeted by a server, Hugo. He was so warm and friendly and welcoming, you wanted to make him your friend for life. What a nice man. And the service stayed at that level throughout the meal. The food Runners, the Busboys, and Hugo, all did an excellent job. Food: Hugo came to the table and explained that the travel deal coupon was good for anything on the menu up to $416. We could get appetizers entrees desserts and alcohol. If we went over by a little bit they would surcharges by that amount only. Nice!! The meal started with to passouts - a plate with pate and some bread slices and four humongous gruyere popovers. I am not a fan of pate but I can vouch for the popovers. Wow, were they good!  To start the  meal, we decided to share the tuna tartare, the grilled bacon, and the Lobster Cobb salad. The tuna tartare comes with house made very delicate potato chips. Spectacular! The Lobster Cobb was a little bit light on the lobster but also was extremely tasty. The grilled bacon was a little on the salty side but I found it to be excellent. As an entrée my wife and I each got the bone in ribeye. One of our friends got the rack of lamb. Each of us found their choice of entree to be outstanding. We ordered the ribeye medium and it came perfectly cooked. One minor disappointment with the meal was the side dish of Hen of the Woods mushrooms. I found that to be rather Bland. We finish the meal with to share desserts. The praline sundae and the s'mores mousse. Delish. The only other minor disappointment with the meal was the decaf coffee which was thin and watery. Ambiance: the only reason this wonderful dining experience didn't get 5 stars. The restaurant needs seriously updated decorating. The overall ambiance here is Casino Cafe rather than upscale Steakhouse. The food and the service are on a par with or better than any Steakhouse that I've eaten in on the strip. And with the Travelzoo coupon but the price point is much much better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was there on 11/26/14 everything was excellent! Prime rib was perfectly cooked and the Fillet was to. The service was top notch it's definitely a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Better than expected!! Was planing to go Gordon Ramsey but was packed and was surprised with the food and wine. Had the tuna tartar, oysters, 2 lb lobster and bone in ribeye with wine selected by server. Very good!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I've had better.  Sitting in the bar area may have been a mistake.  You would think that being so close to where \"service\" staff hung out would assure more prompt service, but nooooo."}
{"text":"The only thing that saved them from 1 star was the bread and the salad. It was the worst $250 dinner I have ever had. Steak was over seasoned, dry,tough, and just awful. The asparagus , over seasoned. The onion rings were good. Bread was Aahhhhmmazing. Service was average."}
{"text":"What an incredible disappointment.   Full disclosure - we did have a Travel Zoo voucher, though that didn't really seem to be a problem.  I made note of it when I made my reservation on OpenTable, the hostess asked for it, and our server took the time to explain how it worked.   The service we received was impeccable.  We never once had an empty glass of wine or water.  Our server took the time to answer any and all questions. We were checked in on several times.  We were never rushed.  If this review was strictly for service, it would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not.    The \"compliments of the chef\" duck pâté was delicious, the shining star of the meal for me.  The popovers are served with salt and unsalted butter, and they are gigantic - much too much bread before a big meal.  Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I enjoyed them, my husband did not. The burrrata & tomato was delicious though the basil seed vinaigrette was tasteless.   The smoked bacon appetizer was very good, and a great sized portion, though the chimichurri sauce quickly became overwhelming.  The mashed potato side was extremely bland, and it's laughable that this is a sharing size.  It came out in a ramekin.    The steaks.  We each ordered the NY Strip.  There is no place on earth that a $60, aged steak, should require me to saw my way through it with force.  I should not have to eat baby sized bites because it's impossible to chew.  I should not require sauce to make it edible.  These steaks were an absolute disgrace.   We had no intention of finishing the meal, and were too full on apps, and irritated, to even bother with sending them back - because yes, both steaks were terrible, which leads me to believe this is not an isolated event.  Shame, because the service really is fantastic, but there isn't a chance in hell I'll be spending another dime in BLT - voucher or not."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I had the steak wedge salad. My partner got the shrimp and grits. Service was good, not great but good enough. We were there on business and not in a hurry. It was nice having a good restaurant inside the hotel."}
{"text":"We been to the NY and DC locations of BLT, and the steak and popovers (what we come here for!) has always amazing. And will be heading back, but just not to the Vegas location.  The place being pretty empty on a Sunday of a long weekend should've been a hint.  Though it was pretty empty and we made reservations, we still had to wait a bit for a table.  The server also just seemed interested in us ordering more food.  Now to the food.  We usually end up getting filet or porterhouse, and we've never been disappointed.   Except this time.  We ordered the porterhouse and was overdone.  And the popovers?  Good, but  weren't as fresh as we've experienced at the other locations.  No complaints about the sides.  Was debating whether to give 2 or 3 stars, but given the price and how the other BLT compares (at least DC and NY), I definitely thought it was more \"Meh, I've experienced better\" than \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"BLT Steak was the first steak house I've eaten at in at least 10 years. I was hoping it would be amazing, and it was.  The Gruyere popovers were delicious!  I rarely eat all of the bread but I ate ALL OF THE BREAD. They were crispy, cheesy, and salty in all the right ways. The duck liver pate wasn't my thing though.   We had the lobster bisque, crab cake, and an heirloom tomato, arugula, and prosciutto caprese salad to start. I believe the lobster bisque and caprese are seasonal items because they were on a different menu. I was very impressed with each item.   My filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had. I ordered it medium well, and it was juicy and tender inside with a crispy seasoned exterior. I ordered the blue cheese sauce in case my steak was dry or tasteless, but I didn't really need it aside from the fact that it was so yummy.  We also ordered the creamed spinach and mashed potato sides, which were perfect accompaniments to our steak.   I was most impressed with the dessert. We had the Meyer Lemon Cheesecake which came with a huckleberry sorbet, and it was out of this world.   Overall, dining at BLT Steak was a great experience that I would love to have again."}
{"text":"I decided to take advantage of restaurant week because their regular menu is pricey. Finally got to try the popovers!  Soft and delicious like I imagined. We were satisfied with everything we had. The fregola pasta was my favorite. The ambiance is nice but it got ridiculously loud in there. Service was spot on even though they were packed. I did find it odd everything came out warm and not hot. Even things served in a cast iron dish."}
{"text":"This is the worst steakhouse I have ever been.  Flavorless meal, zero personality waiter.  I would not eat here again even if it was free, really confused how it got 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't even know to start.  I met a friend here for dinner.  From the moment we were greeted and seated by the hostess, we new we were in for a great evening.  The service is done by 2-person teams.  Perhaps we drew the best team because their level of service was absolutely Perfect.  We were never abandoned nor were we ever rushed.  My friend has the NY strip and I had the Dover sole.  Both were perfectly prepared as were the salads, the sides, and the delicious desserts.  The biggest moment of the night was when the Superstar, twenty something Chef Agata came to our table to check on us.  OMG--this is a talented chef who had it all--talent, personality, and humbleness.  We were blown away, as she Really cared to hear our comments rather than the quick drive by other chefs tend to do.  I Love this place and plan to return many times in the future."}
{"text":"Each time I came to Charlotte and stay in the ritz, blt is always a stop I have to make. Love their oysters, alway popcorn bread, chick liver, and tuna! Tonight I am gonna try the medium rare lamp lol"}
{"text":"I was hoping to get a better steak at a place like this in Vegas. We ordered the New York strip and it was let's say not the best steak I have ever had. It was a very thick cut of meat and not very tender. Our server Mike was awesome and give us a free desert and a discount. I would come back and try a different steak and most like would be a different experience."}
{"text":"Have to say, the bread (popover like wonders) and the duck pate (both compliments of the house) were divine. Wine list massively overpriced, no surprise, but still good. Potatoes, beet salad, and green beans were good, but nothing to write home about. But, the $100 Wagyu steak was extremely overdone. Could have gotten a better steak at a Husky Oil truck stop for far less. Excellent service was the only thing that saved the otherwise well earned and generous tip. If we're going to drop $200-300US for a steak dinner in Las Vegas, we'll go to Gordon Ramsey again in the future."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, tasty food.  Really appreciated the help of the reservations department in getting my business dinner put together."}
{"text":"Great food, but HORRENDOUS attitude from the waiter.  Every request was met with snarky comeback or outright rude response.  I left furious and angry.  Don't know his name, older short man with glasses during evening service during weekday.  At least 3 times when I very politely asked for something (a side sauce, remove the extra wineglass, get a to go box), I was told with a straight face 'NO.' 'WHY?'  I was just shocked. Never have I had this even at McDonald's. then he followed with 'of course you can' as if it were funny.   I came here for a fine dining experience, not to banter or entertain you at my expense.    You barely attended to us, you ignored stacks of empty dishes on our table. If you were remotely competent I might have overlooked the attitude.   As CET diamond I received complimentary appetizers from another waiter, who also jokingly pushed back when I nicely asked for a to go box.  This must be going around the staff.  I told him I already got the humor from the first guy so he backed down, though I still had to justify for 2 minutes on why I needed a box.  I take it this is some form of passive aggressive stress relief to treat customers like sh*t, jokingly tell them 'NO' when you are asked to do something?! I'm not laughing.    Save your attitude and poor humor, it's unprofessional and we don't have time for it.   Customers get few opportunities to come out for a good experience. My time is valuable and this isn't exactly pocket change.  You just ruined my night.  Don't bother going there unless you want to chance the same."}
{"text":"Yumm. Super meaty yumminess. Aussie meat specialist loved it   Gives it 5 stars too. Omg I am so full.... Going into a meat comaaaaaaaa........"}
{"text":"Very nice took my 14 year old for her 1st \"nice\" restaurant dining experience.  We had a great time. Food and service was 4.5 star. My wagu steak was 5 star. Aumbieance was 3, nice but had more of a corporate feel. Would have liked a wider selection of wine by the glass, being with my 24 year old. Nice place to visit! Check out the bacon appetizer!"}
{"text":"Steak is what you get here, and it's very good.   What's not good...the wedge  Actually, all the sides where nothing special at all.  SKIP the sides and just focus on the heavenly melt in ur mouth popover rolls. They're free, so basically you can get a killer steak dinner for 2 for under $100...kind of amazing  The steak saved the day here.   Solid Manhattan."}
{"text":"The food was good but I expected more for the prices. The service was good and attentive. They start the meal with a complimentary popover that was delicious except for a few over cooked spots.   I started with the beet salad. Beets were too large, I couldn't taste the apple and the supposed gorgonzola cheese was blue cheese.   The wagyu filet was good but slightly dry and went well with the pinot noir, gallo wine.   The asparagus was okay but kind of bland.  The truffle mashed potatoes were really good, probably the best part."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed BLT Steak.  We used the Travel Zoo discount deal which provides a very nice discount on the meal.  We started with the tuna tartar which was average at best, however the bread poppers were very good.  Then I had the Bone in ribeye, which was a very poor quality cut of meat, it was mildly tough and had more fat than usual.  Service was average, took about 15 after they brought water for someone to come by and take our order."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh My husband took  me to dinner for my birthday it was absolutely amazing. our waiter Omar was exceptional he was very knowledgeable about the items on the menus was able to give details that I asked about. They brought out a few small appetizers and a complimentary glass of Champaign and a small bouquet of yellow and orange Daisy's for  my birthday. I ordered the seafood platter it was great. then I ordered the 6  oz filet mignon cooked to perfection med rare and great flavor melt in my mouth. My husband has the rack of Lamb that was the best he has ever had for dinning out. Oh and yes the muffins they bring before the meal are absolutely the best. . I will go back for sure!!!!  Even the chef came out to wish me a Happy Birthday ... it was by far the best Birthday dinner ever.. oh did I mention the person crusted banana cream pie with Carmel drizzled over the top .... need I say anymore. Thank you Omar and the female chef for making my Birthday so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything I had was delicious and worth every penny... dollar.   In town for friend's bachelor party weekend, while most of the time was buffets, and tourist spots. The best man, Arnold, decided on one night to have a formal celebration dinner for our friend.   The staff was friendly, very informative, and made us feel welcomed. The gruyere popover breads were oven fresh, and tasty. A bread with a nice crisp crust, and steaming soft center, perfect by itself or dollop of butter.  We asked for more.  All our sides were great, and we shared the likes of mushroom caps, and creamed spinach.  I ended up choosing the truffle mashed potatoes, which are runnier than the average person is use to. This is not your KFC potatoes. This was flavorful. The grilled asparagus was lightly seasoned, but done well.  Most of the guys opted for the usual big cuts of steaks like the 22 oz rib eye, and the porterhouse which were all very good.  I've had fine dining, and great meals all over the world, yet some how never had waygu/kobe beef before, which happen to be on the menu. A little on the pricey side, in comparison to the other cuts, but hey, you only live once. For about $50, I got 12 oz of pure heaven. To be fair the guys made fun of me as I had the smallest cut of meat of everyone. I told them I would give them a small piece, but then they'd each owe me $5 if it wasn't the best steak they've had. Easiest money ever! The steak was properly cooked, seasoned with salt, pepper, and served with a dab of butter. It practically melted with each bite.   I don't remember most of the rest of the weekend. This dinner is an exemption of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."}
{"text":"I will never make the mistake of returning to this restaurant. And by never, I truly mean NEVER.  Got in on a Saturday and snagged a 7:30 reservation. My party arrived at 7:25 to check in, and we still had to wait a good 10 minutes before being sat down. Because we had to be at the Aria by 9, we figured a solid hour or hour-and-fifteen dinner would be enough, but boy, were we wrong.   Though we were presented with pate and crostinis to start (\"compliments of the house\") and some delicious, fresh-baked popovers, it took at least 15 minutes for our order to be written down, which I personally found ridiculous since we knew right off the bat what we wanted to eat. So, let's get to the bad, the awful, and then the worst.  Bad: 1) Drinks took FOREVER to arrive. And by drinks we mean some sodas, a lemonade, one beer and one glass of wine. We had to ask where our drinks were. Seriously?! Also, they don't serve lemonade, but the waiter eventually brought a lemonade to my sister-in-law. Apparently he grabbed it from the restaurant next door...? 2) The waiter avoided us like the plague, which we found insulting. If I'm paying $60 for a cut of steak, you better show me $60 service!  Awful: 1) Literally everyone in the restaurant was eating except us. People who sat down after us were serviced quickly; people in shorts, flip-flops and sweats were getting their food left and right. Yet the well-dressed table of five with smiling faces couldn't catch a glance! 2) We flagged the manager down after 45 minutes of waiting to let him know what was up. He tried calming us down, but when he promised the food would be out in \"5, 10 minutes\" and it didn't happen, we felt bamboozled. That, and HUNGRY AF.  Worst: 1) We were there for an hour and ten minutes and NOTHING HAPPENED. We left starving, angry and ready to complain. 2) We decided to never come back.  Hey, BLT Steak, thanks for ruining our night. Nothing like leaving a an expensive restaurant starving your face off."}
{"text":"Asked front desk at Bally's where to go for dinner he suggests BLT steak and tells us the chef was the last winner of Hell's Kitchen which we are fans of especially Gordon I love him he reminds me of my father that died recently .  We thought we were going to have a great experience.  It started off ok.  Our bartender wasn't the friendliest guy.  I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.  It keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn't care.  She didn't seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it's not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don't care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn't care and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn't care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can't help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren't that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn't hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it's a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell's Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?  If  had known it was $50 for 2 scallops I never would have ordered it,  if you want to start your night off on the wrong foot and pay lots for nothing then you need to go to this place."}
{"text":"Steak was cold and the service was very poor.  Our server (Omar) barely checked in on us. We frequently had to ask for help. There are better places to eat for the money."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend you stop in and enjoy a fabulous meal. We couldn't get a reservation but were able to eat from the full menu while sitting at the beautiful bar. We shared the tuna tartare as an appetizer and followed that with the bone-in ribeye. It was charred on the outside and cooked perfectly as well as very flavorful. It was served with bone marrow too! The tuna was ice cold and delicious. We tried the truffle mashed potatoes - fantastic! The Mac and cheese was good but a little salty. Everyone raves about the popovers for good reason. We were on our way to a show so didn't get to try dessert. We were glad we ended up seated at the bar as the restaurant itself seemed a little too dark. We agreed we will go back next time in Las Vegas. Compared to other steak houses on the strip, this was priced right and better than others. Hope you try it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is incredible, steak is perfectly cooked. The service is extremely slow though. We told them we had a show to go to and was in a hurry but were only served the popovers during the 1st hour. Would have given a 5-star for food otherwise."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot better when it was just \"Bally's Steak House\", then they revamped everything and changed the menu.   Now, I don't necessarily hate this place but the food was meh. My family and I ordered the oysters, tuna tartar, crab legs, rib eye, filet mignon, onion rings, lobster, and green beans.   Oysters - I'm not a big oyster fan but the one oyster I did have tasted fresh and was good. My parents love oysters and they dug this dish so that's safe enough to say that the oysters here are good quality.   Tuna Tartar - Fresh fish and great sauce. Awesome.   Crab Legs - Not as meaty as I thought they'd be, they were seriously lacking.   Onion Rings - These were terrible. Not crispy at all, they were borderline soft and mushy. I don't know what was going on when they made these, but the taste of soft batter and hot oil made me feel sick.   Rib Eye - I don't know why, but my steak was literally charred. I understand when you cook steak it's supposed to have marks on it, but this was unbelievable, all I was tasting was burned leather.   Filet Mignon - Good cause it wasn't as charred as the rib eye.   Lobster - Easily the best. Great tasting, fresh, and meaty.   Green Beans - Typical green beans you'd find at any steak restaurant. They're okay.   The service was good, the price is about what you'd expect at any steakhouse, and the restaurant is kept clean and tidy. The ambiance is good and there is a romantic atmosphere to the dimly lit restaurant floor. This place has its hits and misses and averages out to a decent place to get dinner. I would come back again."}
{"text":"The best service, food and experience ive had at a steakhouse in the Las Vegas Valley. Food was well prepared, timing was great and the staff gives 100% great services."}
{"text":"Been to plenty of high end steak houses(mastros, boa, ruth chris etc) and I must say this was the BEST bone in rib eye I've ever had.  Get the 22oz bone in and you will be in heaven!  Excellent service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"It's an OK steakhouse. We stayed at Bally's and was debating between Old Homestead Steakhouse (Caesar's)  and Center Cut (Flamingo's). Concierge at Diamond Club told us she likes BLT the best so we went for it. Interior decor wasn't anything to write home about. Everyone was very friendly - from the hosts to waiter to wait staff. We shared a bone in strip- it arrived already cut up in pieces which was interesting. It tasted fine. Also ordered stuffed mushroom caps and asparagus- both were fine. My husband did like the popover bread- raves about it.  We usually go to Morton's for steak at home in Denver and I felt the food here was not as good- just fine. No flavors really stood out."}
{"text":"Larell, Mike and Frank all went above and beyond these past two days when my boyfriend and I visited BLT. Cocktails are exceptional but customer service was over the top to bring us back the second day. Can't beat the happy hour with half priced cocktails and good people who make sure your time is pleasant. Thanks guys, will make sure to always stop by BLT when we're in Vegas to see you guys !!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and our waiter Kenny was absolutely fabulous. He explained our options well and was good with attention to detail. We were visiting Bally's on vacation and ate at a few different places. Blt Steak was by far the best! Thanks Kenny!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and amazing experience here with the hubby to celebrate me passing my class... Got a travelzoo voucher and the service here was absolutely amazing... They didn't treat us any differently and were so kind... Ordered the seafood sampler for one, shared that with the hubby... Every table gets popovers and they even give u the recipe on a card to take home... Hubby had the filet mignon and I had the bone in ribeye... Steaks were cooked perfectly and delicious!!! Ordered Brussel sprouts and stuffed mushrooms on the side... Wonderful night and the waitstaff went above and beyond when I accidentally spilled some wine on the chair... They cleaned it up and kept telling me not to worry... I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in town and I'll have to try the amazing sterling brunch when I get a chance!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas recently with a good friend and we had dinner here. I'd only ever been for brunch, and the brunch was amazing so I figured dinner would also be. I was wrong. For starters, the place is in dire need of a facelift or some sprucing up. The service was so slow that after we had our entrees we didn't see our server for almost an hour! I had to flag down another server to find her. I think they need a dress code, because the clientele was rough for the most part. A lot of flip flop wearing, tank top sporting overly served people without basic dining manners. For these prices, you want a fine dining experience, or you would hit the buffet for dinner instead. I will say, the popovers were delicious, and the filet was cooked perfectly. If the service and ambiance had been even a smidge better, I would have gone back. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We came here with two other couples to celebrate our wedding day. When our server found out we had just gotten married he surprised us all with a glass of champagne -Yay! The parmesan popovers were so delicious that I could have just ate that all night and been happy! My husband ordered the parm herb crusted veal chop and it was juicy and wonderful with garlic mash. I ordered the 16 oz striploin and it was cooked to perfection. The service could not have been better and the ambience was very romantic and relaxing which was the perfect end to our amazing day. We cannot wait to go back in the future!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is amazing! They had wonderful service with amazing food. The Popovers were amazing with sea salt. From the second I arrived I was greeted with smiles and delicious scents!!! If I could this restaurant would have over 5 stars. The food was well cooked and perfect! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"Its okay just not great. Service was excellent just the food was not as great as i thought. I asked what i should get. They recommended me with their 28day steak. Got two other appetizers and the potato truffles but all average. Next time i would rather go to a different restuarant or even a buffet."}
{"text":"Great spot can get full menu at Bar during Happy Hour 1/2 off drinks. Staff is cool and down to earth. Tv's in bar area so you can watch your bets play out while you enjoy a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I have to admit that if it weren't for the Travelzoo voucher, I doubt I'd have ever gone here since it's at Bally's, but it was an excellent experience.  Once you get through the casino, the atmosphere is great (although if you're sitting close to the bar, there are TVs playing sports).  Instead of being limited by what the Travelzoo voucher specified, we were told that we could just spend up to the amount and mix and match as we liked.  Awesome!  I was disappointed at first when they brought out bread and not the popovers I'd read about, but no fear, the popovers weren't far behind!  My steak wasn't cooked as I ordered (even after the 2nd try), but the manager gave us free dessert as an apology, so the experience wasn't ruined by that.  In addition to steak we had the beet salad (good), brussel sprouts (excellent), and pumpkin cheesecake (excellent).  They recommend a couple of sides, but we couldn't even finish the one.  So full after dessert!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I booked a stay at Ballys for a work conference and was not very impressed with the hotel itself. My room was a little rough around the edges so I was skeptical of their restaurants..  But I was wrong!  BLT Steakhouse was delicious!  I sat at the bar and had a delicious, fast lunch between meetings and it was the perfect break.   I don't even eat steak, and I can't wait to go back. I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad (without the bacon) and it may have been one of the best salads I've ever eaten. I hope this is a staple menu item because next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be ordering it. The salad came with a delicious bread pop-over compliments of the kitchen with some home-churned butter and sea salt. It was also fantastic and they even send you home with a copy of the recipe!  I'm looking forward to making them for the holidays.   I had a glass of wine, and it happened to be Happy Hour so it was very reasonably priced.   All in all, the staff was friendly, the food was delicious (seriously- can they deliver that salad to LA?!) and the service was quick and efficient. It was perfect for my lunch break and I will for sure be back soon."}
{"text":"The food was bland for how much it was priced . The place is very nice and warm with nice service but the food was very underwhelming. I had lemon chicken which didn't have any flavor really and some kind of cheese stuffed dumpling with sauce that saved the dish. To be honest not worth it, the ambience is better than the food."}
{"text":"Was excited to try the heavily advertised BLT Steak while I was in Las Vegas and splurge on a great dinner.  I sat at the bar and ordered dinner.  After reviewing the menu I found the WAGYU ribeye to be quite tempting - even though it was $91.  I had a great WAGYU ribeye in Houston about a year ago and it was the best steak of my life.  I figured why not go for it - Wagyu is not in that many restaurants.  Of course I ordered the steak medium-rare because you don't want to overcook a Wagyu!  It came out in a nice presentation in a small cast-iron pan.  Immediately I noticed that this steak was very thin - probably about 3/4\" in thickness which alerted me that it would be easy to overcook.  Sure enough, when I cut into it the temperature was MEDIUM - one level beyond medium-rare.  I was ok with that but this piece of meat was not rich, succulent and full of great wagyu flavor which I expected.  It was completely underwhelming.  It was not tough but it was not 'butter-knife' tender like a great wagyu.  The steak was comparable in my judgement to a visit to a local Texas Roadhouse or Longhorn.    Overall, I don't mind paying the total check $125 (steak, one drink, one side of potatoes) but I expect this to really deliver FULL SATISFACTION.  I really would tell the management of BLT that they should consider removing this item from their menu as it is a complete liability.    Last note of interest:  I heard the bartender recommending to other customers his choice of steaks - he said he was a ribeye lover but did NOT recommend the Wagyu or Prime ribeyes but rather a bone-in New York strip.  That made me worried but I had already ordered......."}
{"text":"Our party of three came here for dinner before attending shows elsewhere on the Strip. We were the first customers to be seated early on a Saturday evening. BLT Steak has a modern steakhouse feel-dark woods, comfortable seats, soft lighting-and is tucked away in the back corner of Bally's, which cuts down on casino noise.   Service was excellent. Our server cheerfully answered all of our questions, and we had a lot of them. Although she barely looked old enough to drink, she made a great wine recommendation. Portion sizes were fairly generous, save for the grilled branzino I had that was pretty tiny. Salads are big enough for 2 people to share. The \"famous\" popovers are also large and quite filling, so keep that in mind. Other than the size of my entrée, the only other criticism of the food was my husband's bone-in strip was a little over seasoned...but it must not have been too bad because he still ate the whole thing!  Prices-especially for drinks-are expensive but on par with comparable steakhouses on the Strip. We each had one glass of champagne and one glass of wine, which accounted for nearly a third of our total bill. But if you're on vacation like we were, and cost is no object, BLT Steak is a great choice."}
{"text":"Exceptional! Husband and I had a date night to the soft opening! It was perfection. The smoked bacon appetizer was to die for- and the steaks came hot and perfectly cooked. Our server was personable and knowledgable. I would--and I have-- recommend this place to \"dine\" with your sweetheart."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous! The service was exceptional! Well worth the $60 steak!!! (No need for steak sauce). Everything was decadent! The mashed potatoes were to die for. Amazing steak house! A must go to in Vegas..."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were looking for a steakhouse to celebrate the first day of our honeymoon, and we are happy with our spontaneous decision to eat here. They first serve you bread with pate, then their popovers which was nice and fluffy in the inside, but I tried not to eat so much to save room for our oysters and medium rare bone-in rib eye.   My hubby and I have recently got into eating oysters and we decided to order a dozen. Six from the west coast and 6 from the east coast? I don't know much about oysters but our waiter was helpful to educate me on the difference. One was small, salty and a little sweet and the other type was bigger and more briney. O.m.g. We have tried oysters at a buffet once and our local taco shop, BUT these were such a treat! It was SO good and actually see the difference between the ones we have tried before. The day after we tried Paris Restaurant's oysters and the oysters were small and cost $10 more at Paris. BLT was def much better.   Bone-in ribeye: after reading reviews, I agree that it was a little too charred bc at one point I did spit out. Other than that, we requested medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The meat was big, flavorful, and juicy (thatswhatshesaid). I saved it and ate it for lunch today and it was still good haha. The steak also comes with a side of bone marrow.   We raved about this place to our friends that we all agreed to eat here next time we come back."}
{"text":"BEST MAC N CHEESE EVER!!!!!!!     We ran into bltSteak on accident. We happened to be there and we were hungry. So we thought \"this place is good as any, why not?\" And on we went. We were wrong. This place is way better than most. This place is a diamond hiding in plain sight. The setting was great, the staff was top notch. And the food was everything you could hope for in a proper steak house. We had 1 salad, 2 steaks, a side of mac n cheese with a water. It was $175. Although pricey (let's face it, everything in Vegas is) it was amazing. If you ask my advice, I would say Your on vacation, live a little!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue. Been here twice already. 1st time was excellent. From the moment we sat down to the last bite of my dessert was awesome. Wasn't sure about this place at first it is in the same spot as the old Sterling Steakhouse at Ballys. Love the new updated decor. Right away when we sat down we were offered charcuterie platter, foie gras with jam and toast & cheese bread  with garlic and truffle on the house for 7 star members.  Then the popovers with greyer cheese toasted on top was so yummy!!! We ordered lobster & avocado salad, blue cheese wedge , 2 bone in ribeyes medium rare seared to perfection it came with bone marrow & roasted garlic, well done onion rings, steak tartar!  Second visit we ordered the same with added roasted beet, apple & goat cheese salad, chicken & dumpling soup and dessert you must try banana creme pie & also their passion fruit creme brûlée is to die for!  On our second visit the  steaks came out cold so the manager in charge apologized made us all new sides & 2 cooked to perfection medium rare bone in ribeye! Definitely recommend this place can't wait to try their Sunday brunch !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on the hunt for steak. We were looking for restaurants for a minute and ended up at BLT. However, upon first impression we experienced a small issue with their customer service. We weren't going to say anything but, sort of left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't eat yet.  So, we did speak to the manager, Lawrence and ended up being pleased with the way he handled the situation. The server Leon, was great. He wasn't overly attentive with his good timing and had a good sense of humor. The food was delicious, we ordered seared scallops, Caesar salad, green beans, lobster mash, Mac and cheese, a steak, and lobster. Even the popovers were great! I will definitely go to the BLT back home due to the great time I had in the BLT in Vegas."}
{"text":"The hubs and I came here as a result of the Travelzoo deal - which was quite a steal.   We came on a Sunday night before it got crowded and I'm glad we did. I can see how it gets crazy given it's inside Bally's. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting in the bar. The service here is 5 star and we love that.   As for the food, the popovers live up to the hype - no doubt! We had the grilled/smoked bacon, the tuna tartare, and the french onion soup as starters. We were also gifted with a small plate of pate' and crackers. It was delicious! The bacon is a must for those that love bacon. The husband had the rib eye and I had the bone-in NY strip. Husband's steak came with bone marrow and a bulb of roasted garlic! GIMME THOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!! He was quickly stripped of both.  Dessert was divine. We had the banana pudding with a pecan crust and we were gifted with 2 small brownie bites. Both were heavenly - that little brownie bite was as rich as a huge slice of chocolate cake!  The quality of the beef is definitely prime and they are cooked to perfection. That said, both steaks were in desperate need of salt. We're huge fans of Ruth's Chris and are constantly looking for an equivalent and although we enjoyed BLT, the steaks just don't compare. Would we return? Probably not - there are SO many options in the area. The search continues!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to BLT steak since watching the show Hells Kitchen. PLUS it was our honeymoon treat to ourselves. Sergio was our server and he was fantastic! He made us feel very welcome (we are a younger couple so normally we get so so service from where we are from), he was very attentive, and the wait staff was amazing as well. Our water glass was always full, the food was spot on, and the hostess got us in earlier than our reservation! If you want amazing food try the filet mignon. We ordered it rare and it practically melted in you mouth. Also try the asparagus and the mac and cheese so good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing they started  us off with warm bread,  sea salt and butter I was like salt for the bread but trust me everything combined together  tastes amazing. We ordered the porter house steak in medium, I chose truffle mash potatoes and my husband a bake potato for our side's. The meal was incredible a long with the attentive and friendly staff, our waiter Conrad was unbelievable my glass was never empty what can I say next time I'm in Vegas we will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"BLT Steak does not disappoint!  It's a lovely steakhouse with attentive servers. The popovers are YUMMY!!! They come out first. The steaks are wonderful and the sides are great.  Steaks are prime, dry-aged 28 days.  Dry tender and tasty. Wagyu steaks are available and the weekly/daily menu is very creative. I'm having pumpkin gnocchi tonight. Our friends lived it and we're happy to be back."}
{"text":"I remember visiting BLT Steak when they first opened in Charlotte, years ago and the sandwich and fries that I had back then was just average.  Fast forward to now as I recently had lunch with colleagues and we all  ordered the chopped vegetable salad with chicken and again I say that the food here is just average.  The service is great, and the staff are awesome, I just simply haven't found anything here to get excited about.  I've only visited during lunch so I'm guessing the dinner menu is why so much hype is given to this place, but I don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding service !  Enjoyed our gruyère bread poppers and the excellent chicken livers very nicelly presented. Had excellent oysters to start.  Followed with a perfectly cooked and amazingly good filet mignon of beef.  We got a side of outstanding asparagus.  Dessert was a crepe soufflé with passion fruit soooooo good, delicious.  The only negative is the atmosphere of the restaurant lacks a bit of comfort, coziness. While it is nicely decorated bit cold."}
{"text":"A WONDERFUL experience. Javier offered perfect service - friendly, kind and attentive. The steak was the best I've had in years. Thank you,  BLT."}
{"text":"There is a male bartender here that needs to find a new gig. If you are ever at Bally's and choose to check out this new, trending place thanks to Hell's Kitchen and sit at the bar, you will know what I mean. If he is working. Just our menus and a drink please fella, hold the attitude. You are not so above working here. However, a gal that was newer on bar was amazing, saved the night and resumed our confidence to order (She gets 5 stars). She was under a sharp eye, training to make specialty drinks and asked if we could be her testers. UM, SURE! We tried almost all of the specialty cocktails on the menu and none of them were bad. Enjoyed them all. Especially the blackberry mule. Food coming out to others looked amazing - burgers, steaks, onion rings in tower form. I hope this new, friendly, female bartender stays on here. She was super grateful for her job and and saved our visit by doing it well with a smile. I hope she got our $$ tip but likely not, sadly. Try the original, sinful pan bread they bring out before your order (so good they hand you the recipe with the bread!) and the beet salad. Very good."}
{"text":"Made a last minute reservation Christmas night for 5. Located in Bally's. Our table was ready when I got there but we had to wait for 2 more for our party. This of course, means BAR! I ordered their bloody mary extra spicy. Yummy!  They gave us complimentary bread and duck liver mousse with crostinis. I'm not much of a bread person but the duck liver was perfect. Wished they gave more crostinis.  As for the food, here's what I ordered/got to try:  - Oysters - OMG super fresh!  - Manchego Grits - Not bad. I probably could have done without it.  - Truffle Mashed Potatoes - A bit more watery than your average mashed potatoes but SO flavorful.  - Brussel Sprouts - Crispy goodness  - Creamed Spinach - Not the best I've had  - Ribeye Steak - A M A Z I N G! Came with bone marrow too.  Everyone got a complimentary chocolate truffle at the end. Topped everything off just right. We were all stuffed to say the least and had some delicious leftovers for later when we got drunk munchies. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good overall. One of the top 5 steaks I've had. Popovers are yummy. It was my wife's birthday dinner and they gave us complimentary duck pate appetizer. We're not pate eaters but it was very good. My wife had lobster Cobb and the lobster was as fresh and sweet as can be. I had the bone in ribeye which was delicious. Also had stuffed mushroom side which was tremendous. Banana cream pie for dessert very good. Only thing I didn't care for is what so many other reviews rave about- the bone marrow. Actually I'm being polite (was gross) but hey personal taste I guess. Decor was nothing special. And venue (the old and tired Ballys casino) is not worthy of a high quality restaurant like this. Neither of the aforementioned complaints merits deducting a star.  Food and service were great!"}
{"text":"This was our pre-valentines day dinner and man was it a good one!  We started with the Wedge Salad and Tuna Tartare appetizers and we loved them! We also had their Popovers. They are incredible. Brad (our wonderful waiter) went out of his way to give us suggestions, and tips on how we could make them ourselves at home.  As far as the entrees go, she had the Hanger Steak (medium 10oz) and I had the Braised Short Ribs. Holy heck were they good! The staff was extremely attentive and always gave us what we needed.  Pro tip: Butter + Popover = Heaven Pro pro tip: have Brad as your waiter!"}
{"text":"Husband heard great things about BLT so we went to check it out. Unfortunately it fell short of the standard we expected for the price. We frequent places like Del Frisco's and Sullivan's and this place has the same prices but the food is not on the same level. The Caesar salad was salty...probably from the excessive amount of cheese. There was at least 1/2 cup of cheese on top of the salad not counting the parmesan crisps mixed in. The filet had a nice crust but the inside was flavorless. Also, four bites were fatty and one bite had gristle. For a $50+ filet I would expect better. The jalapeno mashed potatoes and bbq corn were pretty good but nothing to throw a party over. The asparagus was tasty. The three great points I can give them were excellent tea, outstanding waitress, and the peanut butter mousse dessert was delicious. Three stars because we won't be back but only because the price isn't reflective of food quality."}
{"text":"Not even close to NYC. I know, it's Vegas, but this place needs work. Just find another steak joint that's been around. There are plenty. Some are even as good as their eponymous origins...Insult was $11 for fries that McD would be proud and might call their own...Some of the dishes are way too over-seasoned with just too many sauces, dips, etc...Pass on this for now..."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful they would make my boyfriends birthday dinner great. We waited 45 minutes for what our waiter said was \"life changing\"  bacon appetisor.  Then our main course took another 45 minutes to arrive,  cold, and grissley , tasteless NY strip. I thought they were a steak house!!! They comped his meal, but you cant replace an experience or make up for lost time. Btw, the only life changing experience about it is we will book reservations weeks in advance for the better steakhouses hard to get into on a Saturday night!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!  Amazing!!!  Bought the travelzoo deal for $115. They gave us a $208 credit towards food, wine - anything off menu.  The Gruyere popovers were so good!  Bacon appetizer was incredible, and ahi tuna starter excellent.  Wedge salad very good, beet salad pretty bland.  We were full by the time our filet and ribeye arrived!  Excellent steaks, truffle mashed potatoes great.  Best part of meal - \"Hen of the woods\" mushrooms.  You MUST try them!  Service incredible from all staff.  The bar is beautiful - nice place to enjoy a drink before your reservation.  We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Invited for the mock service.  Hugo was our server for the evening and he was great along with all the managers who stopped by our table to make sure everything was super-de-duper.  Drinks: Watermelon Basil which is what I was going to order (Ketel, Cointreau, Muddled Watermelon and Basil).  Hugo recommended the Got My Mojo Workin': I wasn't crazy about the thought of Ginger Green Tea in it but it was delicious! (I ordered two!)  The Cool Woodford was NOT our cup of tea but then again we aren't really bourbon drinkers - it was QUITE strong!   Chef Compliments: Duck Liver Pate with Port Jelly was salty and not bad tasting.   Popover bread with Gruyere cheese wasn't the best for either of us but interesting with the cheese baked right in the bread. I did like the crispiness of the bread with the light cheese taste, butter and sprinkled salt.   Salad: Lobster Salad was SO good! Like SOOO good!! Big pieces of lobster in a Cobb style salad with crispy bacon, half a soft boiled egg, crispy onion straws, different types of lettuce and a delicious house made  Buttermilk Ranch dressing - this could actually be a light meal or almost too much as a starter salad because of all the goodies in it! Just pick out all the lobster and other good stuff and leave the lettuce behind... I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SALAD!  Bibb Salad w/Manchego cheese, beets and a Mustard Vinaigrette was tasty as well - better for a starter for dinner and less filling than the Lobster salad.  Mains: 2lb Lobster from Maine: poached AND grilled to retain its juciness. I love seafood and this was juicy and delish! I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ENTRÉE! I pretty much ate it ALL all by myself!  Waygu Rib eye: Ordered medium rare was cooked perfectly. The flavor was very good, crispiness on the outside but chewey and flavorful. A little salty for me, but some people enjoy theirs more on the salty side.  Desserts/After dinner drinks:  Crepe Soufflé: passion fruit, fluffiness, sweetness, tartness and with the burnt sugar to boot!   Warm Chocolate Tart w/ pistachio ice cream: Ummm I LOOOVED the pistachio ice cream!! The tart itself was a little bitter for me, I'm more of a milk chocolate type of gal but it was moist and rich on the inside.   Grand Café: Friend loved it.  Moscato D'Asti!!! Sweet and delicious!  Chamomile tea w/honey as if I wasn't already in a food coma, this will really help put me to sleep!  Everything was delicious and service was excellent from every staff member on the floor."}
{"text":"My husband took me out for a birthday celebration (29 once again ). Wonderful ambiance, though a tad noisy. Service is absolutely impeccable. Fantastic, generous and delicious portions, next time we will probably split everything!   To start they bring you their famous Gruyere popovers, hot from the oven with room temperature butter and sea salt for the perfect crusty bite!  A plus was a wallet sized recipe was included :-).   He had the spinach salad, with delicious maytag blue cheese and bacon (spelled YUMMY).  I had the Bibb lettuce salad with mustard dressing. Shoe string bits of manchego cheese along with paper thin slices of raw beets and radish. One bite tasted like possible fennel, I wished for more of that flavor. The mustard dressing did not have as much bite as I like. The salads are quite large and I think next time we'll split the spinach.    There are no steak options less than 10oz which is a bit much for me.  I got the filet, he got the wagyu flat iron. Definitely go for the wagyu next time. They offer sauces, I got peppercorn, he got bernaise. We both preferred the flavor of the steaks alone. The peppercorn was slightly sweet and off putting. The bernaise was rich and overtook the steak rub.   Now about the sides....oh my Lord God, thank you for the creation of Brussel sprouts and butternut squash. They were both divine. Butternut squash is prepared as a smooth purée with brown sugar. Brussel sprouts are sautéed with onion, bacon (aka yummy) and drizzled lightly with honey. Honestly I could have had entree sized portions of these two items and would have been delighted. They are both a must try if you see them on the menu. We sadly had to skip dessert as we had to make it to a comedy show (Tony Baker is hilarious).  A fabulous discovery, we will definitely be returning!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Have become a semi regular here and always eat at the bar. Everything is always spot on. The staff is extremely efficient and accomodating."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying rib eyes, ever!  The popovers are a dream & the squash soup as well. Was super happy with the meal - worth the price!"}
{"text":"Recent dining experience at the bar for dinner. Service was okay, not superb. Drinks were way too strong and the cocktail reminded me of cough medicine.  Popover was delicious. Brussel sprouts tasty, but $11?!? Bone-in ribeye is heavenly - the bone marrow and roasted garlic is perfect.  Would return to dine again and have bar eats next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in charlotte, or any city. POPOVERS! They are worth the trip on their own, and they give you the recipe. I tried it by the way, it calls for like $12 of Grier cheese. Anyways, my husband and I get the porterhouse and we love it. The drinks are pricey and more often than not we have to wait 20 minutes past our reservation before being seated. At lunch it is much more casual and I totally recommend the Lobster salad."}
{"text":"Their filet mignon is delicious, and you have to try the Truffle Mashed Potatoes! My wife says she wants to fly back to Vegas just to eat at BLT. Excellent food and service!!! A happy wife is a happy life! We're going back soon."}
{"text":"Was skeptical bc this steakhouse is at ballys.  It was delicious!!!! The bread turnovers are to die for and the filet mignon was so tender.  I also tasted their tbone. Wow- twas juicy like a big ole ghetto Booty ;) It exceeded my expectations.  And service was 100% too."}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed in the quality of food, service, and sitting area for my  dinner I booked for my son's 45 birthday dinner. I would never eat there again. Our dinner reservation was at 5:30 pretty early. By 6:30 it was SO LOUD around us my son could not hear me speak. We gave up on all conversation. Service was not great. The food quality was very poor. My filet mignon and my son's bone in rib eye were cold when served. My steak was tough to cut. My baked potato was cold and had the texture of having been cooked in a microwave not an oven. My fully loaded toppings did not melt into my baked potato.  The tuna and steak tartare were good as well as the creamed spinach. The stuffed mushrooms and popovers were ok. Both seemed to be over cooked.  To top it off I had asked for a birthday acknowledgement; the waiter didn't bring anything until I asked for desert and then he said he took the desert off my bill. Really I didn't want singing or anything like that but may a candle in the desert.  I'm not usually very critical but the BLT steak restaurant in Bally's LV missed the mark on so many levels."}
{"text":"A lot smaller than the LA location. But who cares!! I'm not here because of how big the restaurant is or the color of the dining room walls or carpet. I'm here for Steak... Delicious, Tender and Flavorful beef.   First we start off with some complimentary Foie mousse.. Foie being legal so it's nice being in LV and not LA.   Then you get this amazing Gruyere popover. I crave this popover!!   I order the Shellfish tower for one which includes:  Half Lobster, crab leg, 3 oysters, 3 clams, 2 prawns. Perfect little App before my meal.   I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye that comes with bone marrow, roasted garlic and herb butter. This steak is flavorful, juicy, and exactly what you expect to taste. I must say the crust!! That crust!!! You just can't get this crust anywhere!! I've eaten everywhere. Craft, Cut, STK, Masteros. No where!!  Never been to Peter Lugers, but that's next."}
{"text":"Just left BLT after our stay at The Ritz Carlton. We were sat promptly. Waited at our seats without being greeted for about 10 minutes ... the restaurant was basically empty mind you.    We noticed every other table had bread - we never received any or refill on our water.   We asked for fruit as a substitute of grits or potato on the egg omelette. The waitress said that wouldn't be a problem.  The fruit side was a small portion which is fine but we were not ever informed or told it would be an upcharge of 7$... we did not receive any potatoes or grits to accompany the omelette.  The Lobster Cobb salad was excellent- which it should be for $27.  After being served the food we were never checked back in to see how everything came out - if we needed anything .. both of our water glasses empty   We asked for the check after finally seeing our server and has to ask for more water. Reviewing the check we were shocked to see the upcharge without being told and the server then proceeded to tell us there was one. She did not apologize for not letting us know prior.  Our BLT experience was a real disappointment"}
{"text":"Great modern yet classy environment. Friendly staff with very flavorful dishes. I had the rack of lamb and my boyfriend had the bone in NY strip. Highly suggest it for a nice dinner without all the unnecessary hooplah!!!"}
{"text":"It's definitely not your old-time steak house, but all in all, I enjoyed it. It was kind of expensive, but it was a steak house on the strip, so that had to be expected. Really, the only disappointments were the rather slow service and the pretty bad peanut butter and chocolate mousse dessert. The peanut butter-ish flavor was unappealing and the chocolate didn't help much. We left half of it uneaten, and that is almost unheard of for me and a dessert. The wedding soup was something non-traditional and it was very good. The bone in prime rib was good but I'd try something else if I went again. The filet was tender and tasty. The side dishes were good, but small for $11--small enough for the waiter to mention they would only serve one and we should not expect enough to share."}
{"text":"The filet was really good with the peppercorn sauce. The wedge salad was tasty. My hubby got the surf and turf which was also really good. Wasn't thrilled about the asparagus and mushroom side with poached egg. Would come back here also because David was such a great server !"}
{"text":"Every year we have the best steak dinner at BLT.  This rivals any steak house on the Strip.  We both had the bone in rib eye, outstanding!  Started with the shrimp cocktail, rib eyes, au gratin potatoes and asparagus.  Topped it off with the AMAZING desserts of Banana cream pie and Peanut butter chocolate mousse. Try the \"First Lady' cocktail!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. Service was behind excellent, the food was incredible and the staff could not been friendlier. I've been here many times and will be back many more."}
{"text":"Nice dim vibe. Classy jazz music. Nice restaurant in Bally's. Not busy and easy to get seating.   First came the toasted bread with jelly, which was compliments of the chef. The jelly was smooth and mild. It wasn't sweet at all. More of a savory rich taste. There was something beneath the jelly which looks like peanut butter but tastes nothing like it. Perhaps it was almond butter? There was a complimentary bread that was nice and steamy when you broke it open. One of the best breads I have had at a restaurant.  I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare. Very juicy and great with the added butter. The chef also provided complimentary dessert. Brownie bites. So much complimentary appetizers and sweets that I didn't even order any. I am a stuffed animal now.  Server was very attentive and did a good job. Always on the look out for you. Can't complain about the quality of service."}
{"text":"Nice dark steakhouse interior. Very friendly waitstaff. Everything came out in a timely manner.   Started us off with free duck pate and crackers, was kinda meh. The came the bread, their cheese popovers. These were warm and ridiculously good.   The steaks: I got the dry aged bone in ribeye mid rare, was perfect and also ridiculously good. My friend got the ny strip mid rare, we didn't send it back but it was definitely much closer to rare.   The sides were disappointing. The carrots looked steamed with some weird mint herb thing in it. The string beans were fine but not impressive.   Then finally the chef sent out a free brownie bite thing which seemed like it was sitting out for a long while.  Overall come for the steak and popovers, skip the sides and dessert."}
{"text":"My work office and I came to BLT for dinner. We did have to wait a while to be seated but not unusual for a party of 8. The table was worth the wait since we were given a private room inside the restaurant. Our waitress started us with drinks they have a large selection on beer, mixed drinks & wines. For my appetizer I had the crab cake which was very flavorful however do not order if you're not a fan of onions. For my main course I ordered the filet Mignon medium rare plus which was cooked to perfection with truffle mashed potatoes. The food was amazing and the staff was friendly and attentive I definitely recommend BLT to every guest staying at the Balleys casino."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience.  I will give it 3 stars because the food was really fantastic. When you dine at a 5 star restaurant, you expect 5 star service.  Our server, Jonathan, was one of the worst servers I've ever encountered. I'm a server myself, so I am very critical. The place was empty for a Saturday night, we made reservation but walked right in.  We placed our drink order and food order at once, which I can't stand. I would like a glass of wine while checking out the rest of the menu.  It took 20 minutes for the drinks to come - our appetizer and salads came out before our drinks!!  We were livid!  We had to ask where our drinks were.  Never at one point did our server ask how we were doing, how our food was or if we needed anything else like drinks or napkins.  We would've loved another round of drinks, but were never even given the opportunity to order another. At one point during our meal, he actually stood over on the other side of our table and stared at us eating talking to himself of what he needed to do next.  I don't know if this server was new or not; but we didn't care.  We were so unhappy with the service and did not expect this from a 5 star steak house where our bill was $200. Unfortunately, it put a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back because of it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and outstanding service with Margo and Willie.  The chefs tasting was awesome.  Absolutely 5 stars"}
{"text":"We went here for a nice steak dinner. They give you complimentary popovers. First time i had them and they were good. We started with the tuna tartar. We thoroughly enjoyed the tartar but they give you chips to eat the tartar with and very few of them. Slightly disappointed.  I ordered the lamb chops because they sounded yummy. Boy oh boy i was very happy with my choice. Great flavor! I ordered a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. They were nice and crunchy.  My friend ordered steak. The NY strip with bone in. He said it was fab! The truffle mash-potatoes were not as good as i thought they would be. My other friend's steak was not worth the price but i forget what she ordered.  The staff was attentive. If you leave to powder your nose, the cloth napkin will quickly be snatched up and refolded for your return. They also sweep off the crumbs from place setting for each course served. Kinda tedious if you ask me.  So food overall was good. However i would never go back. The prices were high and you don't get sides with your meal."}
{"text":"Amazing steak!!! They explained when ordering that the steaks are served with a distinct char, which made me nervous, but this was truly some of the best steak I have had!  They start the meal with popovers, which were excellent, they serve it with the recipe so you can attempt to make at home.  We started our meal with the crab cakes which had the perfect crab to bread ratio.  With the mains we had onion rings (big, crisp and the perfect coating) mashed potato (creamy) and the brussels sprouts (mixed with bacon).  Dessert was a delicious piece of banana cream pie, with a thick crunchy graham and nut crust and the filling had big chunks of banana.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for my parent's anniversary. No reservations need; we managed to get seated within 5 minutes. First off, the restaurant looks very classy. It had a really intimate feeling - perfect for a date.   For appetizers, they gave us duck pate and crackers, which were interesting. They also gave us their pop overs, which is just puffed up bread with cheese. It also came with a card with the recipe to make them. I got the Braised Short Ribs and a side of mashed potatoes. Both were really delicious. The meat tasted buttery and melted in my mouth.   It's a bit on the expensive side, but the food is amazing. My parents had an amazing time."}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to stop in for her 30th birthday this past weekend. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Robert. He was very nice, informative and patient.  His service is incredible, he easily connected with all of the customers making us all laugh and feel comfortable. He was very timely with getting everything to us and made sure that we were happy! Also, you can tell that the managers there really care about their customers and the restaurant. We met Warren and Lawrence who made us feel special and taken care of. We stayed for hours because of the atmosphere and the food was AMAZING!! We cannot wait to get back to Vegas to eat there again and will tell all of our friends about our awesome experience."}
{"text":"Don't go here!!! Service is slow, food isn't that good and it's very expensive. There are way better restaurants on the strip for the same price. I live out side of San Francisco and have eaten at many fine restaurants. This place is on the avoid list. The only thing I liked was the pop over, the drinks are gross! For a 14 dollar mixed drink it should have been shaken and then served on the rocks. My steak was cooked to how I wanted it but it wasn't impressive it was still a little a tough and was drenched in butter that's it very boring place very boring food. Go to Gordon Ramsey steak at Paris. Food service ambiance is better. The manager at this place is a slim ball. He needs to work at McDonald's. Not worth the time either 3 people no desserts and it took 2.5 hours to get through dinner never again and I want others to not make this mistake!"}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING experience at BLT. The staff was top notch not to be out done by the food. My wife and I enjoyed our meal with recommendations from our waiter Tony. They set the mood for a wonderful night followed by a jubilee show which was in the same building."}
{"text":"We had an opportunity to take a second trip to BLT steakhouse this past week. We started with a steak tartare, which was very excellent (for those of you who can do raw beef, of course). Some things seemed different on the second go around versus the first time. The popovers tasted even better. We also ordered the porterhouse for two which was more flavorful and hotter than it was the first time. I thought the presentation was sharp and the meat expertly prepared. As with the first time, the service was great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service but the charred steaks threw me off. We were warned but it was a little strange for a restaurant like that. The 22oz ribeye with red demi glaze was amazing. The popovers sent it over the top though! They are the house bread but must be ordered if your usually not a fan. Will return if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite in Vegas! It is located inside the Bally's casino.   The service was better than other steak houses I've been to on the strip.  Margo was the best and so was everyone else that was helping her at our table. Everyone was very attentive, friendly and fast.    There was a good selection on side orders and all tasted very good.  All of the steak and seafood we ordered was delicious!    We even had a VIP chief tasting that was free. Dessert was even given for free at the end for all 9 of us.     We had a party of 9 and had a booth all to ourselves. It was great!  We were celebrating two birthdays at this dinner and we will come back next year to do the same."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this stunning representation of a culinary masterpiece....  I'll say this...there can be no pop without an over...a breathtakingly sinful concoction of a combination of bread & cheeses!  For most, this would be the grand finally...alas, BLT performed an E-Street band worthy encore of whipped butter and a tin full to the bone of salty excellence (salt).  Once this triad of flavors hit the taste buds a rather unique biological reaction happens in the form of a slight moan & your eyes gravitating towards the back of your head in what can only be described as pure ecstasy... Once you regain consciousness you are elated to find out the experience has just begun for there is still the main course yet to come.  What awaits behind door number two is what the gods call heaven on earth, if you consider your heaven a perfectly cooked bone-in strip with a char so immaculate I'd slap my mamma if I weren't certain she'd retaliate guns blazin....  I was able to tackle the beast with my sharp cunning as an individual...along with my trusty cattle prod, Betsy, should the event turn sour.... I would be remissed to conclude this trip down the rabbit hole without mentioning the cornucopia of titans charged with creating this immaculate experience.  The GM Laurence Silva , backed by the experience of Warren and Tammy.  A team so warm and inviting it could only be described as a sanctuary of a weary traveler in search of culinary existentialism.  Their dedication to delivering truly great service is matched only be their ability to make you feel at home with their warmth and generosity.  Kudos to Mr. Silva and his management team.  They are gods/goddesses among ants in their craft and touted as such across the industry."}
{"text":"We just returned from Las Vegas. We ate at BLT on Friday night and the and the food and service was great. We ate there again on Saturday night after leaving Gordon Ramsey's Steak because the place was un-bearable. We were not disappointed on both our visits. Superb food both nights and our server Omar was the best we have ever had. I also want to thank Warren the Manager and Lawrence the General Manager for all their hospitality. Because of them I WILL be back to visit In my travels across the U.S. I have never had such good service and food. Congrats to the whole BLT Steak team for making it worth spending my time with them."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  We ordered a jumbo shrimp cocktail app, and were also brought out 3 sample appetizer plates, compliments of the chef :)  My husband ordered the filet, which was melt in your mouth tender.  I can never pass up ordering Chilean Sea Bass, if it's on the menu, and it was. It didn't disappoint, although I may order that steak next time!  The sides, although they say are enough for 1 person, were plenty for us to share.  They also serve popovers, a bread with melted cheese on top, that were sooo good.  I ate until I could eat no more.  After we told the waiter we were too full for dessert, he brought out MORE complimentary items.  Brownie bites and cake pops.  I was so impressed by this restaurant, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything here was wonderful! My fiance and I ordered the burrata appetizer, the porterhouse for 2, the truffle mash, and the green beans!  The porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tasted great! The green beans had lemon zest, parsley, and garlic and was extremely flavorful.  Our server was also very attentive and kept our water glasses filled to the brim.  BLT stands out from other steakhouses because of the 3 complimentary items they gave. They started off with a duck liver crostini, then their bread that wasn't any normal bread, but a gruyere baked bread that looked like a muffin. Then at the end they gave 2 mini brownie bites that were delicious!   I also used a groupon,  so I received $31 off my meal over $100.  I will definitely return! This was one of the best steakhouses I've ever tried and it was unbelievable that it was located inside Ballys!"}
{"text":"Great sea bass. Did not have the bottle of wine I wanted so thEy went to adjacent hotel to accommodate. Would return alone on service but food was great too. Don't pass up the bread"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Came in because of the mailers for some neighborhood discount. They still honored it even though it had expired which was great. But the wagyu steak and the Dover fish were already sold out... So had to find something else. I went with the short run which was flavor full and soft. We also got the union rings which were good. Fiancé got the new strip medium. It was good too. We also had the seafood platter (which came out a little late) but it was comped. The ceviche was yummy... Very tiny but soo tasty. Definitely should make its own appetizer!!"}
{"text":"First off the customer service was above and beyond, starting from the hostess, food server (Hugo) and bus person. Secondly, the FOOD presentation was awesome and when my family and I tasted the food, We are all amazed. The food was      AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! We got the chance to meet the Executive Chef Sean. He was above and beyond and did a very good job! I highly recommended this restaurant. 2 thumbs up  and 5+ star We are looking forward to dine in again!!"}
{"text":"Had my 50th bday celeb 15 people great food great service! Sommelier was on point tuna appetizer fantastic great ambience!"}
{"text":"Only heard about this via watching Hell's Kitchen. I happened to be staying at Bally's so decided to give it a shot. The place is beautiful. The decor is dark and lightly lit creating a perfect date atmosphere.   I received ok service, not bad enough to knock a point off, but the waiter seemed uninterested especially since I didn't order wine. But I know service isn't the only thing.   I received a pop over that I didn't order, my guess for use in promotion. But it was a pleasant surprise. The bread melted in my mouth. I wanted more, but knowing my stomach, had to save some room. I even received the recipe on a card to take home.   I ordered the port wine braised riblets with a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese came in a skillet and used a white cheddar sauce. It was excellent. The riblets came out in a huge skillet pot filled with sauce and the hunk of meat in the middle. The meat just melted, I mean melted like chocolate on a 90 degree day,  in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly and so tender.    After my amazing meal, I got to meet Hell's Kitchen winner and new Head Chef Ariel, only three days into her job. She seems truly confident in her work and team and after eating that meal, I told her to keep going forward because it was awesome.   The price is what you would expect from vegas. Entrees are in the 40-55 range. But the quality of food is worth every penny.  If you happen to be near Bally's and want a great dinner, I highly recommend BLT Steak."}
{"text":"Excellent steak house. Our server was Ramone, he's been working the restaurants in Bally's for 42 years and he definitely showed us why. Personable, funny and timely. This restaurant did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Our meal started with a complimentary duck liver pate with mini toasts, very delicious and a nice touch. Next came the BLT popovers, a kind of bread that I'm told is famous. It was pretty good and was served with butter and sea salt. We ordered the wedge salad. It came with enough of a portion for two and was very good, not the best I've had, in fact, I would say Austin's in Texas station is one of the best wedges in Vegas, but very good nonetheless. I ordered my favorite cut, the one which I judge all steakhouses, the bone-in ribeye, medium rare. This steak was awesome!!! I've been to nearly every steakhouse in Vegas and this one is definitely one of the top I've had. The critic, my wife, ordered the king crab legs. We actually share everything so most of the time she picks what I eat as well. The legs were delicious; sweet, moist, succulent. She was impressed by both the steak and the crab legs. Not so much the popover bread, which is weird because the bread is usually her favorite part. For sides we ordered the fries with cilantro mayonnaise and the potato skins. I know, lots of potato. I alway have leftovers for my daughter and she is obsessed with fries, so, I order them. They were really good though. The potato skins were very good. To end the meal we chose the banana cream pie. This was not what I expected, it was amazing!!! From the crust made with graham and nuts to the fresh bananas inside, both my wife and I were very impressed. And it is large! Enough for us both plus a huge chunk for the kid at home. Our server was Leon, assisted by many, and was very great. This was one of my Groupon meals as well and he was very great about it. (I get so perturbed by the ones who start with an attitude when they find out you're using a Groupon, especially since I always tip on the full amount). In summary, the food was great, the service was great as well, and the prices are to be expected."}
{"text":"BLT Steak at Bally's is very good. I've found some of the best cuts there. The pop overs are legit."}
{"text":"Wanted to do something nice with Boyfriend for my birthday dinner, so we decided we would try our very first official fancy pants American Steakhouse.  We were staying at Flamingo and didn't want to travel far, so this worked.  We called in the morning, they mentioned they were pretty open, but made reservations for 8pm anyway.    The decor was more modern than I thought it would be, and brighter than I thought.  And the tables were slightly close together--we could perfectly hear our neighbor's conversations, and noticed every time they stared our direction.  A little more privacy would've been nice.  We eventually were also neighbored next to a boisterous bachelor party, but, whatever, it's Vegas.    After trying to get some insider info from our server, Leon, (see below) we decided on starting with raw oysters and we each ordered the 22oz bone in ribeye with a side each of Mac and cheese and truffle mashed potatoes.  We also ordered a dirty martini and a glass of Riesling. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful popovers we had and the amuse bouche  (a lovely, light duck pate with croutons) was so so good.  All the food was tasty, and cooked to perfection.  I ordered my steak 'black and blue' and it was exactly that.  The herbed butter on top was heavenly, and I would've loved more of it.  The steak itself was tender, with good flavor, nice marbling, thick cut, lovely crust... And the truffle mash was the highlight of our night.    For dessert we ordered the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake, and they stuck a candle in it for my birthday.  They also brought out two bonus brownie bits, that were standard. Boyfriend loved the cheesecake.   Our server, Leon, was perfectly nice and tried his best to be accommodating.  A couple of things-- we had mentioned this was our first steakhouse and asked some questions about the meat and he gave me a recommendation based on my tastes.  I also asked about the sides, and such...He gave me text-book information about the items, but honestly I just wanted a \"go with [this item], it's seriously the bomb\" or \"you really don't want to miss out on this\".  I left feeling I should've tried other things instead of what I ordered.  He went above and beyond when he brought me a taste of the wine I was thinking of ordering (and thank goodness he did, I hated the wine) and asked the kitchen if they could allow us to order just half a dozen of raw little neck clams (they were running low so the kitchen said no, we'd have to order the whole seafood tower) and thanked us for coming in.  But service all in all was very very slow.  Lulls in the meal were long and plentiful.  The whole meal was pushing 2 hours, and it was definitely mostly waiting time.    On the whole, the place is good, the food is worth a visit, but I'm not sure I'd come back.  Having to spend that much on a meal ($250 tax and tip included), I expected at tad bit more, but was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Las Vegas.  Is there anyplace with a higher concentration of first class steakhouses?  Well, yeah, actually there is - Buenos Aires.  But that's so far to go, and why bother when for only about half the price of a ticket to Argentina you can go to BLT Steak?  (Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, but BLT Steak is kind of pricey.)    Looking back over my Yelp reviews, I notice that my five-star ratings tend to go to places that serve a great steak.  I didn't plan it that way.  I guess I just love a great steak.  Well, BLT has them.  My bone in rib eye was fabulous, and my wife loved her filet.  My rib eye came with bone marrow on the side and I ordered a delicious Bearnaise from their selection of sauces to go with it.  Our side of potato skins was more than enough for two, and perfectly prepared.  I started with the Bay Scallops \"Rockefeller\" - a creative idea that was well executed.  My wife started with a wedge salad - a mundane idea that was also well executed.  I think attention to detail matters, and at BLT it was apparent immediately in the complimentary amuse bouche (a pâté) and the delicious popovers.  The bread plate is one of those little things that allows a restaurant to distinguish itself, and those popovers were certainly a creative way to do just that.  And they thoughtfully provided us with the recipe on a little card.  The room is warm and inviting, with soft lights and tables well-spaced for quiet conversation.  The bar had a big screen TV, visible from the dining room, which was a bit jarring, but I suppose you just can't get away from the screen these days.  Other than that, the ambiance was very nice.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Our server, Mario, was helpful on our questions and very quick with anything we requested.  One quibble - the drinks were a bit overpriced and not overly generous.  But, c'est la vie.  This is not a place to go if you're pinching pennies anyway.  Oh yeah, and by the way, sorry New York and Chicago but no - you don't have a higher concentration of great steakhouses.  I know you think you do but, as they say, \"Vegas, baby!\""}
{"text":"Even though I had reservations and showed up 10 mins early, they still made me wait 20 mins which defeats the whole purpose of a reservation but whatever I was really excited to eat here.  We ordered our food and the waiter brought out Popovers which were really good.   We waited 45 mins for our food- I still don't know why it took so long. The steak was ok I think I liked the Popovers a lot better.  Overall, I wasn't amazed by the food. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Crazy Bernie is a big fan of BLT Steakhouse. When a steak house has the nerve to name itself after an economical lunch sandwich you know you're dealing with culinary geniuses. After thinking I've eaten at the BLT in NYC I made the move to try the one in Paris LV. Soon after ordering I realized the 60 barrels of rum I've drank in the past 40 years may have caught up with me. This was my first time at a BLT and it was awesome. The tornado (my wife) and I often order apps and one entree as we did this time. Just right for not feeling stuffed to the gills. Puffed pastry style bread is to die for. Wedge salad was, ah, a wedge salad. And the medium rare filet was cooked to perfection and delicious. Kind of crispy outside and beautifully pink inside. Enjoy life folks. Nobody gets out alive"}
{"text":"The worst steak ever!   Our porterhouse was COLD and had no flavor.   The butter pat didn't even melt   Here's the thing.   They spent all this time making popovers (blah) and appetizer plates but pay no attention to the cornerstone product.    The three steaks we ordered were tough, cold & flavorless...the best part of our $500 meal were the mushrooms.    I don't like writing bad reviews but when you have the audacity to over charge; it better be worth it.    We even gave them the opportunity to fix it but they were mad and brought back the steak slightly warmed.    Our advice is to skip this joke of a steakhouse"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good steak, try Outback or pretty much any other steak house. The best part of the meal was the bread and Salad starters we had. Two of the three steaks didn't come out at requested temp. Even after sending one back it still didn't come back at temp. The carrots were undercooked, truffle potatoes were runny and I had requested Horseradish Sauce which came out half way there the meal. Waiter didn't seem overly concerned about the steak temp or the delay in the sauce was like whatever.   The steaks were charred on the outside undercooked and lacked flavor.  There are many other places that have steak in the name and serve a better meal.  Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Swear to goodness, this might be the best steak I've ever eaten.   I prefer my steak a medium well-- and most places struggle to achieve this without burning the steak.  This was sheer perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent steak. Excellent service. Excellent presentation. 6 people dining and we had a 400+ bill without alcohol and no leftovers. I strongly recommend you make the reservation through tix 4 less or tickets 4 less. I paid them $20 for the reservation and saved 30% on the food- over $100. Still extremely expensive but made it more reasonable."}
{"text":"I'd always wanted to dine at a BLT restaurant in NYC and never made it, so having the opportunity here was perfect. You wind your way through the Casino at Bally's to get to this gem.  The whole experience was really excellent. From the friendly hostess, waitress, circulators and even the management- we were well cared for and just had super service.   Ok, food!  We had the French onion soup, wonderful and cheesy. I ordered the 6oz Waygu Beef Filet Mignon, and it was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The extra money for the Waygu was worth every penny. I had the green beans as a side and they were delish. My companion had the monkfish wrapped in bacon with broccolini and bow tie pasta, which was also very good.  We were very happy with our portion sizes.  Now, the popovers! What a fabulous bread service to offer. They were out of this world. As a bread baker I was tickled. Popovers have been my only failure. BLTSteak provides the recipe and I cannot wait to give it another shot.   Hard decision, but we passed on dessert. I'll absolutely visit another BLTSteak or BLTPrime in the future."}
{"text":"A little loud but refined decor.  Excellent service.  An extensive and tasty wine list.   The amuse was a chicken pate that was immensely flavorful and moist.  For an app we had the tuna tartar which was solidly flavorful and beautifully presented.  The bread is a warm crusty popover (recipe included) that I could eat all day.  For the main course I ordered the ribeye and my date had the filet. The filet was cooked perfectly to the requested temperature and very flavorful and tender. The ribeye was mostly medium rare aa ordered though some of the thinner bits were over done almost burnt. The sides we had were the potato gratin and brussel sprouts.  The potatoes were good. The brussel sprouts were the weak point of the evening, they could have used a touch of acidity.  The meal included a chocolate espresso petit four that was top notch.  4 stars for some minor flaws. At the price point I expect perfect. Plus it was hard to converse."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed our dinner last night. It was my birthday but my fiance and I have a deal not to announce it at restaurant's. From beginning to end it was wonderful. It was definitely my first pinky up dining experience. We were going to cancel the bread but so glad we didn't, the pop overs were wonderful! They come with a little recipe card which I will definetly try. I ordered the beet salad and my love had the spinach salad.  Then we ordered the porterhouse for 2.  It was cooked to perfection and it melted in our mouths. The banana cream pie with the pecan crust finished off our dinner with a bang! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews usually but feel if yo want you evening completely ruined do to language and disrespect go here. Our waiter introduced himself and before drinks were ordered started disrespecting in a sexual way. No we are not different we are not in any way dressed but to enjoy evening. I found this appalling at a supposedly \"a fine steakhouse\"  I was drinking an ice tea, annwaiter started again with more disrespect. I guess once wasn't enough. I then said politely \" we don't deserve your conversation\" he again could stop himself when my phone rang at the table. I quickly turn off ringer because I'm not one to talk with guests at the dinner table. Because I had to tell him if he made on more rude assalting comment I would shove this dinner up his ass, I couldn't see eating it because I felt he would have spit in it(or something)  Ruined evening due to waiter, if I was his employer I would have told him to leave \"on the spot\" not just come an say to me \"He says things he shouldn't\""}
{"text":"This place has definitely lost its curb appeal.  Their flagship spots in NYC are perfect, but this location is an embarrassment.  From the burnt popovers, the rude bartender and the refusal to put the cheese on the side of a baked potato sends me back to other spots for steak."}
{"text":"This place gets a major thumbs up!!  I couldn't believe this was in the Bally's hotel. Came here for the Sunday Brunch, which they call the Sterling Brunch.  It's ayce lobster, crabs, caviar, and other goodies!! We made reservations in advance, and Jamie (hostess) was sooo nice and sweet Since we were a large party, she put us in a private room. The service at BLT is excellent!! So this place is not your typical buffet, they are all about quality not quantity. They have ayce lobster tails, king crab legs, stone crab legs, fresh-shucked oysters, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, sushi, omelette bar, and so on. They also have a separate menu you can order from (that's where the unlimited American Sturgeon Caviar is), which is still part of the brunch. Unlimited pours of Perrier-Jouët Champagne, mimosas, and bloody mary's!! Oh and my fave Gruyere cheese-flavored popovers from BLT Steakhouse!! I would sooo recommend this place, it is pricey but so worth every penny. If you have a \"total rewards\" card you get $5.00 each person. Next time your in Vegas check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse! Been to Hawaii one too! We come here every international event we have in Charolette for ACN!"}
{"text":"More than pleasantly surprised. I took my family, didn't expect to much. The atmosphere is stunning and elegant ... The staff, waiters and management.. Spot on with kindness and service. All of us, pretty much got a different plate.. Ans everyone loved their steaks. I was lucky enough to get Chef Ariels newly added signature steak from her Hell's Kitchen show. Everything fro. Brining to end, we above my expectations.. And I need to give a big shout out to Ariel, while making sure to get everyone's meals going etc., took the time to greet us.. Which was a little rude of us to ask, she had a job to do, and she was kind and went out of her way for us. I will be going back! Thank you for winning the show and cooking up a dream Chef Ariel. Also, your retweet made my parents day!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots we've been here for the Sterling brunch on Sundays super delicious from free caviar crab legs all you can eat oysters lobster tail amazing and for dinner tonight we had the herb crusted parmesan veal chop mashed potatoes my husband had the tuna he was not very happy with that. To start half dozen of oysters always a good choice happy give you 3 sampler plates some prosciutto capicola hard salami Parmesan bread and a crusted bread with duck pate no dessert for us tonight but they always have the classic banana cream pie oh and they're popovers that they serve before dinner absolutely delicious and mouthwatering"}
{"text":"Best steak house in Vegas! Loved this place  service was absolutely amazing! We had dinner and went to a show afterwards which was so much fun! I highly recommend the Wagyu beef  Loved loved the truffle mash potatoes! The duck  pate is absolutely wonderful! The popovers are really yummy. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves steak you won't be disappointed. Kudos to Cecilia she was very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food great service A little pricier than my usual steak but OK for Vegas prices I would come back"}
{"text":"We had a great glimpse into BLT Steak from bar seating and the appetizer menu.  Entrée prices were very high for our late evening stop in.  The waitress was friendly and prompt with our beverage of choice, imported beers in the $7 range.  We ordered potato skins and a soufflé crepe in passion fruit sauce.  At least 10 flavorful potato skins arrived.  The crepe was to die for decadent--possibly the best food I ate all week while there!  That alone would make me want to return!  She brought over complimentary popovers, their huge signature gruyere-laced Yorkshire pudding type things.  We found them to be too crusty (almost burned) on the outsde but we enjoyed picking out the cheesy-flaky innards.  and free was a nice touch.  It was a trendy place to hang out--and not too loud, we could converse.  It was tucked in an intimate corner of the large lobby floor and is one of only two restaurants in this hotel (Bally's)."}
{"text":"As others have experienced, the staff was very nervous and seemed to be always in a state of panic. The decor seemed just meh, but it was weird that the waiter station was in the middle of the restaurant. The good news, the steak was cooked great, we had a bone-in rib eye with the bone marrow (which didn't really taste like anything). The main course didn't seem to be the \"bell of the ball\" it was more of the side dish compared to the Chef's specials that came out as appetizers. The duck liver was good and the pop-overs were great! The truffle mash was extremly salty and the mushrooms were salty and looked like a pile of mush. Anyways, we probably won't be back as we frequent las vegas. I told the waitress about the salty food and that she said they enjoy getting feedback, but I was really saying it was un-edible, I was just being nice."}
{"text":"I don't normally use profanity in my reviews, but \"Jiminy Jillikers Batman!\", that was an amazing meal! Hopefully the Yelp higher-ups don't see that and everything will be gravy baby!   BLT Steak really blew me away during my visit. The ambiance is amazing considering this restaurant is located in the back area of Bally's Casino. I was surprised to see that BLT has an open concept location. I thought the slot machines and general white noise of the casino would bleed into the restaurant, but once you walk-in casual conversations and soft music is all you pretty much hear.   The service was impeccable from the first glass of wine that was poured to the end of the dessert menu. Every time a food order was served it came with a brief explanation on how it was prepared and what exactly was on your plate from left to right. After each course, plates were promptly taken away and glasses were refilled, the table was cleaned, new silverware was placed down, and I was ready for the next foodie exploration.   The food at BLT is amazing!  I didn't necessarily love everything I ate, but still respected the time and craftsmanship that went into it. For example, we were given a Duck Liver Mousse in a small mason jar with a sealed lid along with some sliced and toasted whole grain bread. This was compliments of the Chef and although the presentation was beautiful, this wasn't my favorite. Guess I'm not the \"Duck Liver Mousse\" type of guy. I also tried cheese and bacon crostinis with a sliced meat plate which consisted of sliced Chorizo, Sopressata and few other cured meats, I can't recall their names, but these were absolutely amazing. Great way to get my palate and tummy ready for business.  After the appetizers the main course arrived...Braised Short Ribs, Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled White Asparagus. This was a sexy looking meal, literally food porn right in front of my eyes; I felt naughty. The Braised Short Ribs came to the table in a cast iron cauldron and it was still simmering in it's own juices. These savory juices added an aroma to the table that made my dinner mates increasing jealous with every waft. I dug into this large portion of short ribs and was amazed at how easy they slid off the bone. I took my first bite and I swear the meat was dissolving before I even began to chew. To describe these as tender would be an understatement; buttery, smooth and delicious would be a good start. Then I got crazy and added the Truffle Mashed Potatoes to each bite of short ribs. I think I went into a full food orgasmic episode. I couldn't stop.  Every bite made me more and more excited. If you're not getting it, this meal was f**king amazing!  As I slowly started to come out of my food induced wet dream. I sat there and couldn't stop thinking about the meal that was presented to me. Holy smokes there's no possible way to fit any more food in me...\"Would you like to see the dessert menu?\" our serve inquired. \"Yes, that would great!\", I exclaimed. I won't get into these sweet creamy details because my I might make a mess all over again. I'll just say, \"Banana Cream Pie\". Oh Yeah.   This place is a must try whether you're a tourist or a local. Bring your father-in-law here and maybe he'll finally call you a man, and shake your hand."}
{"text":"So good! The food is excellent. I always get the filet and have never been disappointed. Those popovers though? They are divine! They keep me coming back. Any bread served with a side of salt wins a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Stopped by again on our yearly trip to Las Vegas and ended up having Tony again for a waiter! The place was just as we remembered - amazing food and staff and we had such a good time talking to Tony again. This will definitely be a yearly stop for us!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was outstanding. Caitlyn our server was awesome. Very knowledgeable attentive without being pushy and she was a lot of fun. We were headed to the theater so service was prompt. Cooked my filet to perfection. If you go get the corn side dish."}
{"text":"I think 2 stars is too many but... very disappointed. Husband got a ribeye and it was over cooked and tasted like an old grill. Pop overs were way over cooked too. We won't come back and that's really sad because we were excited to eat here."}
{"text":"Best meal we ever had! No kidding. The bone-in rib eye was cooked to perfection with amazing flavor. The 2lb lobster was out of this world and the oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty. My husband and I couldn't stop talking about the meal days later."}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations at 6:45p and we didn't get out until after 9:20p due to the extensive waiting around for service. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and getting anyone else's attention was difficult. We must have had the worst table in the busiest area of the entire restaurant, loud. Manager only came by to get our check processed.   We order the Porterhouse, truffle mash, beet salad. I was disappointed with the meats toughness. The mash wasn't any better. The beet salad was ok, nothing grand. Refills were hard to come by, thankfully we ordered water too which was on the table.  For dessert we ordered the banana cream pie; it was the only excellent thing about the night. Kudos to the pastry chef.  We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town...exquisite food and exceptional service. The steak was succulent and seasoned perfectly. It was cooked to my perfection. The popovers served with the meal was a special treat. They were absolutely delicious, and I enjoyed getting the recipe for them."}
{"text":"Too pricy for me for dinner, but I have had a couple of lunches here. Steak sandwich is very good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely yummmmy, mushrooms were ok, nothing special, you get only 1 crab cake as an appetizer, most places give you two...my steak was amazing, dessert carrot bar was Delicious"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, usually for lunch. The food has always been pretty good. The service is usually sub par. I took a couple of my team members here for lunch today to celebrate a birthday. I am on a ketogenic diet, and tbh, you can eat keto friendly at pretty much any steak house.   Since it was lunch, I ordered the BLT Steak Burger, but I asked if I could get it in a lettuce wrap instead of on a bun. I was told I could not, but they could bring it bun-less. This is not a huge deal, but if fast food restaurants can accommodate this, I'm not sure why a place with $14 hamburgers cannot. I'm not cheap either, I'll order a $100 bottle of wine at dinner without missing a beat.   The burgers only come listed with three side choices, two types of French fries or sweet potato fries. I'm not currently eating either. I asked if I could substitute some sort of vegetable instead. I was told yes, but there would be an upcharge. I asked what the upcharge was, and the server told me it would be the full price on the menu of the side.   So.... if I want asparagus or mixed vegetables instead of broccoli, that will be $11? So a hamburger and a couple pieces of vegetables is $25 but a hamburger and fries is $14? No thanks. I just had a naked burger and didn't touch the fries.  The popovers are great. The food is good here. I've always found the service to be meh, and after today, I probably won't be back. There are just too many places in town that provide excellent service and have good food in this same price range."}
{"text":"By far the best dining experience of our trip!!! The pop overs at the beginning are made in heaven. The service was impecable. The rest of the food was just as exquisite. The wine was slightly pricy, but then again, it was Vegas! Not pricy enough to lost a star. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Prior to my last visit to Vegas, I solicited my fellow Seattle Yelpers for dining advice - specifically, where to go for steaks. I was dissuaded from dining at this restaurant, and other places were recommended instead. However, I saw a Groupon deal for BLT and we didn't want to blow our whole budget on one meal during our visit, so I decided to give this place a try.  And we were SO glad we did!  From beginning to end, our experience here was A-1. The service was fabulous, our food was fabulous, the ambiance was lovely, and everything was great. As others have mentioned, the complementary appetizers were incredible: toast rounds with duck pate (I didn't have this but my hubby said it was divine), and we both swooned - SWOONED! - over the large, warm, soft gruyere popovers! OMG, these were the best \"breads\" we had ever had in our lives. We talked about it for days afterwards. (What a nice touch, too, to include the recipe for them! Like, in a million years, I could ever replicate these wonders...but still! Nice thought!).   I had the tuna tartare and a side of asparagus. Both dishes were super. The asparagus' stalks were peeled so they appeared to be albino spears, and they were cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. Hubby had a ribeye steak and I had a bit of it and omg it melted in my mouth. Medium rare and cooked to perfection and tender and moist and oh so flavorful. One of the best steaks I have ever had. (I forget what sides he had. We were so rapt with the steak).   Too full for dessert but they brought us out some complimentary brownie bites. I had asked for some Earl Grey tea and they brought me out a tea cup and hot water and the \"sides\" of sugars and Splendas, but when the server came with the tea caddy, they didn't have Earl Grey! In fact, the selection of teas was quite limited. I was surprised they brought me all the tea fixin's when they didn't have the specific tea I had ordered. I politely refused any others (I only wanted my Earl Grey). This was the only \"issue\" with the whole meal - and it is a petty one at that.   Even if we hadn't had the Groupon, we gladly would have paid full price for our meal. It was that good. Better than good. It was great!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  We've eaten at most steak places in Las Vegas and wanted to try something new.  We were pleasantly surprised at our find in Bally's of all places!  Service was fantastic, managers checked in multiple times, and the sommelier was superb and so helpful.  The complimentary duck patte and popovers were amazing!  We shared a porterhouse and the dover fish across 3 of us - all super yummy especially the fish.    Would definitely recommend this place and plan to go back ourselves!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner/happy hour at the bar and could not have had a better meal for my first  night in vegas on my most recent trip.  Starting the meal, the complimentary popover was so fluffy delicious and salt and butter added that extra element. For my entree, I ordered the branzino and mac and cheese. The Branzino was perhaps the most delicious fish I've had at a restaurant with it being perfectly seasoned and deliciously crispy skin. Mac and cheese was good but, if there was a fault, I'd say it needed more bread crumbs on top. I wasnt able to finish the mac and cheese because of how filling it was (you could enjoy one order for 2+ people).  Service at the bar was wonderful. The bartender told me I was at the end of happy hour, half price drinks including wine, so I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender asked if I liked the glass and said he'd be more than happy to add another drink at happy hour price for me to enjoy later (since I was still, barely, in the HH window). There were several people working there and checking on me.   I will be back for that Branzino. I know my husband will enjoy this place and I cant wait to take him here."}
{"text":"My husband and I got to experience this new steakhouse inside Bally's. The food was great!! We started with the spinach with bacon vignette salad. I was surprised with the flavors of the salad. The blue cheese added to the mixture of flavors. I am normally picky with meat but the filet mignon was so good. I recommend it, it was nice and tender with good flavors. The flavors got more intense with the horseradish sauce I ordered. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were average. Overall the setting and server service made the night. If you are around the Bally's casino, stop by BLT Steak. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's all about the sear. And BLT has done it to perfection. The rib eye is a 22 oz monster and is seared to perfection on all sides, leaving a soft, tender, and juicy core. Be warned - it is enormous, so save some space in your belly. Hold off on the tempting popover they serve you with butter and sea salt. Yes it is delicious but space consuming in your stomach.  Your steak deserves all the attention you can provide. Don't bother with the sauces - they provide you with a bone marrow and roasted garlic. It's all the flavor you need. Scoop some of that gooey heaven from the bone core and smear it on your steak. Or dredge your steak piece in the buttery pan they serve it in that is coated with bone marrow/garlic goodness. Perfection.  Don't make the mistake I did. Start eating from the bone - in. It's the most tender and flavorful. Because once you get to eating around 75% your belly will reach its max. Don't leave the best part on your plate.  Steak and red wine is all you need. Time to get behind the felt now - and throw some dice!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, our waiter brought so many things for us to try prior to dinner. Everything was brought out correctly and in a timely manner. The lobster was absolutely great! However, it is a really pricey restaurant and if you'll willing to compromise for potentially less than stellar service, I'm sure there are other places with cheaper meals with comparable food in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"?????????????????????BLT ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??? Steakhouse??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?? Las Vegas???Bally's Las Vegas Hotel????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Went tonight kind of by accident. I was pleasantly surprised. The steaks were good, as good as any other high end steak house I have been.  But the Brussels sprouts were definitely the best I have ever had!  Simply amazing. And the peanut butter dessert was fabulous!  Our waitress and other staff were very friendly and attentive but no where near overbearing. The ambiance was very nice. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for the weekend. We'd actually to head to the room after visiting one of the bars and realized, though it was late - we were hungry again. We were headed to The Punch Room and decided we were feeling more like a BLT atmosphere!  Wonderful choice!  Food and drink were fantastic, great bartender who was spot on every time he made my Whiskey Sour. (I so love old school cocktails!).   We had the Porterhouse for 2, Brussels sprouts, Gnocchi, Hen of The Woods mushrooms ( first time trying them - yum) and sticky toffee Pudding Cake ... oh my! Did I already mention the Whiskey Sours?    I think my husband drank Cognac neat most of the evening but the food was absolutely wonderful and plentiful. I wasn't familiar with Hen of the Woods mushroom but they were lightly salted, very meaty (hence the name) and flavorful - this would be ideal for a veggie lover with the potatoes and creamed spinach.   One of the best late night dinners we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"OMG.  Most likely the Best filet mignon I have ever had. No sauce, no toppings, no nothing but pure delightfully cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Don't forget the Branzino, again,cooked to perfection, so flakey and moist, absolutely incredible.  Staff was absolutely wonderful, attentive, accommodating and genuinely kind, polite and positive!  Go, go, go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse in Charlotte conveniently located within the Ritz Carlton Hotel off Trade & College. I walked in to explore it for the 1st time during Queen Feast Restaurant week and sat at the bar to enjoy my meal.   Highlights: english pea risotto, hanger steak was amazing! I love the sauce they create to pair with it and their frittes are on point!   Bartenders, Greg, very polite and knowledgeable about spirits and created me some great concoctions to enjoy with my dinner.   I love the location of the bar, new to the city I love stepping out solo so the bar was perfect for people watching and not feeling like you're in the middle of the dining room.   Go over to the Ritz Carlton lobby for live music & drinks on Friday eve."}
{"text":"Popovers were a welcome treat to start. The steak was perfect and service was great. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here was very good and priced accordingly. I put my self in a food coma after, but still  would recommend eating here. You can't go wrong with a bitch'n steak!"}
{"text":"Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming."}
{"text":"So on my birthday all I wanted was a juicy rib eye steak and dammit BLT delivered.   BLT Steak was recommended by a few people so I figure why not. My rib eye was ginormous! They cooked it perfectly the way I like it medium well. It came with bone marrow which was not my thing but ok..   They also gave us liver mousse jam with crackers.. Liver totally grosses me out and my bf forced me to try it and it wasn't bad nor good but he liked it. The bread was super fresh, warm and crispy. The salad was very good as well.  The service was beyond excellent! Everyone very friendly. Atmosphere was classy, simple, and romantic. We will definitely come back again.   Also gave us complimentary fresh baked brownies for my bday. My birthday steak hunt was a success. Was a lil unsure about going to Bally's casino to eat but this restaurant was worth coming."}
{"text":"The best filet mignon I've ever had!! A little pricey but definitely worth it especially for a special celebration."}
{"text":"Went because the yelp reviews were pretty good. The stars did not lie. This was worth the money. Got the ribeye. Cooked perfectly medium-rare, came with a whole head of roasted garlic, nice pat of herb butter and they spice up the bone marrow too. Mouthwateringly delicious.  You get a good amount of gratis stuff too. Included was a little dish of beef pate w/ some jelly, and two really big popovers that were super-delicious. But as others have said, don't fill up on the appetizers, because the steaks are big, and the sides are shareable.  Only reason it wasn't a 5 was because the server dropped the ball a bit at the end. We had coffee for dessert, he took our order, but forgot it. And when the coffee finally came the sugar packets were all soaked through - someone must have spilled water on them and no one caught it. But overall, good service as well."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch in Vegas, bar none.  Reservations is needed of course. Sergio, our waiter was very attentive. All you can eat which includes lobster tails, Alaskan king crab legs, which is not the usual, lower quality,  snow crab legs , sushi, steak, etc. Popovers, lobster or steak eggs Benedict were also offered. Champaigne was also offered or mimosa."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here for my birthday dinner last night (we had a groupon). The restaurant is beautiful, perfect for a romantic dinner. It's dimly lit, wine bottles lining the walls and creating a beautiful atmosphere.  The service seemed a little slow, otherwise I would have given five stars. I ordered a cocktail, the bees knees to begin. It was gin, lemon, honey, and egg whites for texture. It was delicious but took probably 10 minutes to come out, and the restaurant had maybe seven tables seated. The staff was very accommodating as the first table we were seated at was next to a party of four very loud, and raunchy people. Seriously - the conversations they were screaming for all the restaurant to hear made me very uncomfortable. I couldn't even talk to my fiancé across the small table without yelling! The waitstaff reseated us in a different room, were extremely polite and understanding, we were very thankful for that.  They brought out a complementary duck liver mousse with crostinis, it was to die for. Very creamy, a nice way to start the meal. They also brought out two popovers that were moist and fluffy. You could taste the egg and I devoured mine. They also attached a tag with recipe and instructions on how to make them at home. (Nice touch)  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, with stuffed mushrooms as a side. I ordered a Cabernet to drink. My fiancé ordered the New York strip steak, medium rare, with a baked potato.  My steak was perfectly cooked, the spices in the crust perfectly complimented the flavors of the filet. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The little stuffed mushrooms were tasty as well but I was so full I only ate two. Overall, aside from the noisy table we were initially sat by and the service running a tad slow, it was a perfect steak dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointed as service was quite weak last week just cause we let it be known we paid for a Travel Zoo voucher to use.  Was excited to try cause am a big fan of Hell's Kitchen too and one winner was elected head chef here.  Big portions and quite tasty but carrots were so hard, barely cooked, and the regular menu prices are through the roof ridiculous over priced with very little ambiance to offer.  Could barely hear the music and just listened to other's conversations.  Food 3.5 out of 5, service 1, ambiance 1, prices 1.5."}
{"text":"Best.Food.Ever!!! BLT burger & potato skins were enough for two, &  Bartenders Stephanie, Ted, & Larell made our night - GREAT service! !!"}
{"text":"Incredible dining experience all around! Several unique choices and the expected steak house standbys all executed to absolute perfection. Great restaurant hidden in a hotel in dire need of remodeling. We had a party of 5 and tried everything we could. Zero complaints. One nice feature of it being stuffed in the back of Ballys is that you can get a table almost anytime with little to no wait."}
{"text":"I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to food but my experience with the bone in NY strip was very disappointing! My steak was so tough it was difficult to cut with my steak knife.If you are going to a steakhouse you expect the meat to be the star and the quality of my steak did not match the $69 price for just the steak. Service was fine but steak was a real let down."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Steaks were prepared to our order and were first rate- as they should be for the prices charged. Where we found a shortcoming was the wait service. It appeared to us that they were short of staff and we had a series of different people coming to our table.We were there on  a Tuesday night around 9:00. We expect first rate service in a restaurant of this caliber and were disappointed."}
{"text":"Being in the service industry myself it can be hard to go out and enjoy yourself sometimes. Sit down, have a nice meal and be surrounded by good people. this was the definition of everything you could ever want. I went to BLT for brunch on Sunday prior to the Superbowl. Everything was on point. Starting with the hostess Char finding us a great table. All the way to the the waiter Sergio making sure our drinks stayed topped off. Then to top it off a very sincere Farwell from the Manager Warren and the hostess Char giving my Lady a rose as we departed. The experience was awesome. Lobster tails, Crab legs, waffles, salmon, bacon, and even the dessert buffet were all fantastic. I will be back."}
{"text":"We went on the Travelzoo deal $115 for $210 worth of food.  The jumbo prawns were good, while the tuna tartare dressing was overpowering with a really strong salty soy flavor. The bone in ribeye steaks were very stringy and not very tender.  The carrot cake with ginger ice cream was ok.  If I had paid full price I probably would have sent the steaks back."}
{"text":"This place seriously ruined our night. We've never walked out of a restaurant before tonight. After showing up just before 7pm we were extremely neglected by the staff. They didn't even take our drink order! For Vegas there are much better choices than here."}
{"text":"Coming from Charleston SC, this is the best steak house around Charlotte. Great service, fantastic menu. You will not be disappointed. If you're looking for chain style prices, don't even attempt it. You get what you pay for here. One of the best meals I've had. Up there with Halls Chophouse in Charleston. Great for a date, anniversary, business dinner or just to spoil the one you love."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Porterhouse and New York strip were simply spectacular, and chef gave a wonderful complimentary popover bread to start. Best onion rings I've ever had to. Price was right, and Leslie was a wonderful host for us. Thanks for the wonderful experience! Best steak I've had."}
{"text":"Dinner before Jubilee. The food was fantastic and the service incredible. I ordered the red snapper and it was slightly dry but other than that delicious. The asparagus was also prepared very well, but my favorite part was the Gruyere popovers fresh from the oven. Wow! I ended up eating two."}
{"text":"We decided to head out to Vegas for Christmas and why not a steak dinner. I ordered the bone in new York strip, crab cake appetizer, brussel sprouts, baked potato and a glass of Merlot. Everything was excellent. Service was great. The only thing I had reservations about was the steak was pre-cut into 4 pieces. I like to cut my own steak.  My sister and her husband ordered the porterhouse for two. They thought it tasted bland.   Oh and that strange bread cheese thing. Amazing."}
{"text":"Tony is an amazing waiter and the food is fantastic.  I highly recommend this place and ask to be seated in his section.  Get the steak.  There's a reason it's called BLT STEAK"}
{"text":"After our disastrous visit to the Gordon Ramsey steakhouse, it was a delight to find stellar service and fabulous food at BLT Steak.  The popovers were, expectedly, warm, buttery and delicious. What we did not expect were the additional duck liver raspberry pate, mini-pizza slices and assorted meat plates that the chef sent over simply by being a Diamond Rewards card member. Good thing we forgot to order the Tuna Tartare that we had our eye on!  The 28 day-aged Ribeye did it disappoint. Perfectly marbled with gooey fat and lightly charred to make the spices dance in your mouth. It was a good thing we decided to taste the Short Ribs after the ribeye because, seriously, this dish is the star of the night. Melt in your mouth, fork tender, buttery ... Oh la la. Our server, David, was on the money when he said the short ribs were probably the best thing on the menu. I would visit BLT Steak again for this dish alone.  With no more room left for dessert, we were again pleasantly surprised when the chef sent over another two complimentary plates: peanut butter jelly and passion fruit pops + brownie bites. A fantastic end to a delightful culinary inclined night."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, so let's get that out of the way and talk food.  I wish I had more time....I had two appetizers, and one of the signature whiskey cocktails that I don't remember the name of but it was great.  The Fois is superb, topped with a cherry glacé and served with crostini. It's simple perfection. The seafood sample platter was picked clean by myself and one other person. Everything on that platter was so fresh, they might as well have gone out and caught the array of shellfish and Crustaceans themselves. My only regret is not having enough time to stay for dinner. We'll meet again BLT Steak."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing the popovers are fricken gooooood!! Price was fair but had same elsewhere for less.  You pay for the name Gordon Ramsay. Heard mixed reviews wouldn't expect to hear bad but guess it's anywhere.  Would go again for anniversary but maybe a deal idk."}
{"text":"Last seating at 10:30pm and my date and I arrived at 10:25pm.  YAY!  Thank you so much for accommodating us at such short notice.    I wanted to eat steak but didn't want to pay for the high priced restaurants in Vegas.  Definitely a great choice and moderately priced.  (except my wine which was $22 a glass)   Our server did not rush us at all but he was very nice.  Located in Bally's Las Vegas, beautiful decor and chill but not so romantic restaurant.   Food:  Complimentary bread with liver spread and complimentary popovers 22 oz bone in rib eye (medium) served with complimentary bone marrow.   Grilled Asparagus  Mashed Potatoes Complimentary dessert- Chocolate Brownie Bites  The food was all on point.  The steak was made exactly how I ordered it and I love the char on the outside.  No salt needed.    I can't wait to visit again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked into the Ritz Carleton, and if you know anything about the Ritz then you'll understand when I say the BLT's decor is just as swanky! The hostesses are always friendly and the servers really take care of you hand and foot. For a lovely steak dinner, or a great burger, this is the restaurant to go to on a nice night out on the town. They've got a nice wine menu and really cool see through wine room rack for those winos out there who love to see their bottle literally come off the shelf!   The chef is known for sending out a complimentary tasting appetizer to start the table off, which is always such a treat. On top of that, you always get complimentary HUGE popovers as an appetizer while you mull over the menu. The popovers are AMAZING! They're so crispy, with a soft inside, and come with delicious butter.   For appetizers that aren't complimentary, their take on a caprese salad is super flavorful. Also, their beet and goat cheese appetizer is a light, healthy starter as well.   When it comes to meats for an entree, they know what they're doing. I recommend the filet, or the wagyu steak is phenomenal! You could honestly share any of the entrees and then order a few family style sides to make it a full meal. Their potatoes gratin and asparagus are nice compliments to fish or beef. But the real side showstopper is the loaded backed potato....seriously, you'll regret not ordering it -- loaded with bacon, chives, butter, and other tasty ingredients, and then completely coated with cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a steak joint up in Bally's!  I sat at the bar dining alone that night.  The bartender and servers were very attentive and never once I felt pushed away.  I ordered me a glass of tempranillo; ding nice indeed.  I went with the hanger steak and side of potato skins.  They brought me some starters, which to my surprise were very good especially if you're a table bread person.  They're popover bread is no joke and pretty darn good along with some sea salt.  The hanger steak was perfectly cooked; nice and tender with a tab bit of a crush on the outside to give a crunch - Yum!    Overall, great experience and couldn't ask for anything more.  Great service and food! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You HAVE to eat at this restaurant when in Vegas, at Bally's. Being from Chicago, I've eaten at some great steakhouses, and I'll tell you, this is one of the best. Great service and wonderful food. Short Ribs were awesome. Thank you BLT."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I'm posting this a little late; my husband and I went there for dinner about 1 month ago at the end of July. This was our honeymoon and I am so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.  Firstly, the hostess was very very sweet and asked us if we were celebrating anything special. I said that it was our honeymoon and they treated us like gold. They seem to be very nice accommodating and customer friendly anyway so I have no doubt that they would have true that's just the same had it not been a special occasion.  The restaurant was very clean and decorated in a very modern and contemporary atmosphere. Our waiter was fabulous, explaining everything on the menu, going over all of the specials in cocktails explaining everything in detail. He was wonderful!   Everything we ordered was awesome. To start, we got complimentary duck pate, which I've never had before but it was really good! After this course, they provided complimentary cheese popovers, which were again amazing. They also provided small recipe cards so you can make the pop overs at home if you wish. I thought this was a very nice touch and very classy. My husband and I shared the Porterhouse  for two, got a few sides, and also three dipping sauces to try. Again everything was delicious!  We picked everything clean!  Additionally, the cocktails were very good. My only criticism is that each cocktail was $14 each which, I know is Vegas, but still, a little expensive.  Naturally, we had to splurge on dessert and we weren't disappointed. So rich and delicious, each I believe were only $10, which seemed like a steal compared to everything else, haha.   Howeve, my favorite part throughout the whole experience was watching the staff members throughout the evening. There seem to be multiple managers walking around, checking on customers, in addition to the incredibly efficient wait staff. I was very impressed that multiple folks came by to ask us how our meal was, how experience was, and knew that it was our honeymoon and congratulated us.  It made us feel really special and made the experience very personalized.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert which were too small chocolate bites because they knew it was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday was the day before. It was cute, small, and had a lit candle in it which was very nice.  We absolutely loved it and I wish that there was one near off in Boston! It would probably make us go broke!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here many times and this is our favorite steakhouse in Vegas. We try to eat here everytime we go to Vegas if possible.   Most recently, we went to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and of course, this was the place to go. The prices are on par with other steakhouses, however, for the sides, they ARE small portions, so the sides are much more expensive than other places... but we rarely finish everything because they give you quite a few things in between.   For those who like to saw a few bucks. They usually offer a Travel Zoo deal. That is how we initially discovered this place and we've been coming back since. The Travel Zoo is an amazing deal! You get over $200 worth of food for only $100... but my boyfriend and I always go crazy and we typically end up about $100 over... but it's all worth it! Don't be afraid to buy the Travel Zoo deal. It says 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, etc for the deal. However, in reality, you can order whatever you want. They will just take off the value of the voucher at the end of the meal.   We usually go for the bone in ribeye because it's sooo delicious! It's a huge cut and I personally never finish it! It's actually big enough to share, but my boyfriend loves the food here so much that he said that although we should share... he doesn't want to because he wants leftovers to eat again!   It's $60 for a giant cut of bone in ribeye and it's cooked perfectly to your liking. It also comes with bone marrow. Other cuts vary in price, but the most expensive is waygu for $90+. This time, we each ordered a ribeye, plus we ordered a 2lb lobster to share. We ordered the lobster tail before to add to the steak, but a 2 lbs whole main lobster is a better deal! It was delicious, tasty, and big! They crack the meat from the claw so everything is super easy to eat. It came with a cognac sauce. For our sides, we ordered the creamed spinach and mac n cheese. Usually we order creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes, but we wanted to try a little something different. All the sides are good though. However, out of those, I would say the truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite. We did also try a side of their special menu, the pork belly with grits. I would have to say that I was disappointed with this... the grits were good, and I'm not a fan of grits. They were shaped and fried into triangular blocks and deep fried. That took it to another level and with the tomato sauce and pieces on top, it was delicious! I ordered this dish for the pork belly. That's what sold me... however, there was only 3 tiny and I mean tiny pieces of pork belly on it!! This dish just was not worth it unfortunately. For dessert, we went with the banana cream pie to share. It was a big slice! It was not overly sweet and I really loved the pecan nut crust. I loved the crunch it added to the dish! The pie was very refreshing and seemed to clean out our palate well after our meal. Every time we have been here, they give you duck liver pate to start. I always look forward to that because it's so light and delicious!! You get a handful of crispy bread to spread it on. It's a great way to start the meal. Next comes the popovers, which is one of their specialties. You MUST try it, break it open, spread on some butter, and sprinkle a little bit of the salt they give you! It's heavenly!! I have to stop myself from eating them all before the meal comes out because they are that good!! To end your meal, they also give you some small dessert bites. We were given little brownie bits. They were soft and chewy. A perfect addition to out banana cream pie!! Since we were celebrating our anniversary this time, they also gave us 2 glasses of champagne on the house to celebrate!  We love this steakhouse not only for the food, but also for the excellent service!! It has also been consistently good and the waiter really talks and jokes around with you. We have always had 5 star service here from start to finish each time. To find this place, walk towards the back of Bally's. It's past the Buca De Bupo and SEA. You do not hear any of the distractions of the slot machines and the ambiance is relaxing.   We'll be back here again and again!! It's must on every Vegas trip now!!"}
{"text":"Don't know why it should get less than 5 stars but our dining experience was all that and more.  The flavors were exceptional for all of our dishes.  I had the sirloin: rich flavors, tender and cooked to perfection.  My friend ordered chicken and it was a unique, outstanding dish that I will go back just to get the recipe.  Husband had the veal chop which was a little bit of heaven!  We ordered the green beans and truffle mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were so light, creamy and truffles were so rich it was almost a sauce.    Our waiter, Hugo was charming, warm with a sparkling wit.  Had to hug him on the way out!  Loved the restaurant so much, we came back 2 nights later and ordered all the same things.  My opinion is, this is the best steak house in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I hate to have to write such a poor review. My friends and I were on a group birthday trip for all of us and decided to treat ourselves to an awesome meal. Based on reviews we thought this restaurant would be great. We were wrong. We expected to pay high prices and that everything would be a la cart. What we did not expect is that the quality of the food would be so low. I got a moscow mule to drink and it was horrible. Not made the correct way at all, you couldn't taste any ginger beer it tasted like sprite. When we ordered I got filet Mignon, medium rare. My friend got the braised short ribs, and my other friend got the rib eye There aren't many choices on the menu and all of the cuts of meat are huge.  My steak was cooked OK, but the center was cold, and it lacked seasoning. The short ribs were mostly fat. My friend was digging to find actual meat. Her plate was filled with grease when she was done. And she probably got about a cup and a half worth of meat in total. The rib eye was cooked OK, but lacked flavor. All of the meat lacked flavor honestly. Ruth Chris costs less and tastes better. Needless to say we were dissapointed. Our waiter didn't even ask us once how our meal was, or if we were doing OK so we could complain to him (ours had an eye patch). I would NEVER return here or recommend it to ANYONE. It's not at all worth the $80 each you will spend. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We decided to try BLT Steak while we were staying at the Bally's. I read good reviews and I got very good feedback too. I made a reservation for two at 8 on a Tuesday night. Host stand staff was very nice. One of the hostess walked us to a side waiting room where we probably waited only a couple of minutes until our table was ready. When we seated we were greeted by our waitress, Roxanne and another guy brought us some water. We ordered two glasses of wine and then we placed our appetizers order, a crab cake and a steak tartare. Right after we ordered, we were served a small plate with some bread. After I tasted I have to say that the bread was amazing, one of the best bread I've ever had in my life. It was baked with fresh gruyere cheese. Our appetizers were also delicious and very well presented. As entrees we ordered Sautéed Scottish Salmon and Grilled Ahi Tuna. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. For the salmon we choose a side of grilled asparagus and for the tuna we choose a side of stuffed mushrooms who were amazing. At the end we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure their dessert choice was great too. Our waitress was very attentive and professional. She was also very informative and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Great experience."}
{"text":"I always find it hard to get excited about steak houses; I consider it a limited medium of expression. That said, I was thoroughly delighted by my experience at BLT. Our server, Hugo was clearly a fine dining veteran. His attentiveness, knowledge of the menu and affable demeanor was first rate. The manager, Casey, checked on us several times and we wanted for nothing throughout our meal.  As for the meal itself, we enjoyed warm cheese popovers, oysters on the half shell, a well-executed tuna poke and charcuterie. My medium-rare porterhouse steak was seared, broiled and properly rested. Dessert was decent, but I didn't consider it to be on par with the rest of the excellent meal. Nevertheless, I was thoroughly sated at that point.  Overall, I would consider BLT Steak an under-recognized star in the Vegas dining constellation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just WOW. Where to start? The food....the service....AMAZING. First off, the lady who answered the phone to take the reservation (I think her name was Shen) was super friendly and accommodating. Once we arrive at the restaurant, our server David was amazing. Because we are members of the Diamond club, the chef sent us complimentary appetizers and dessert. We were a party of 8 and the food all arrived together and hot. Everyone was gushing over their meals. We ordered food writer, tuna tartare, and meet tartare and bacon for our appetizers. They were all perfect. They also brought us complementary bread popovers that are buttery and delicious. We each ordered different steaks and they were cooked To perfection. One party ordered the Branzino but changed her mind and they replaced it immediately with her second choice which was a lobster salad which she loved. Portions are HUGE. The dessert is amazing- we had almost everything and all of it was good. If you order the sorbet, you get four scoops so be sure to ask for different flavors if you so desire. Overall, one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Wow."}
{"text":"One star doesn't even cut it. Not worth the premium to stay at the ritz. Service has gone down hill. Server in the bar was our only highlight of our stay. Breakfast was overlooked. Service staff unresponsive until it was time to get the check. Toast was cold. We asked 4 times for butter. The drapery smells old and dingy. Don't sit next to it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon and so did my friends, so there's the 4 of us and a 1 year old.  Horrible service from our waiter Omar.  We literally was there for 2 hours. The steak takes at least 40 to 45 minutes which I understand was part of the wait. We waited for our  menu and our server, had to ask for refill of our water. We hardly saw our server except for when he took our order and brought our food.  He was quick getting me ketchup when asked though but overall service was horrible.   We got the NY steak - medium well, which was salty.  Got two filet mignon - medium well but it came medium rare and well done.  The steak wasn't bad and was really great and tasted amazing even though it wasn't cooked the way we preferred it. The salmon was cooked just right and it was good. Recommend that. Our side items consists of French fries and came with a mayo type sauce which we didn't prefer, just asked the server for ketchup; the French fries weren't that great either, it tasted like the oil they cooked it in and the it'll needed to be changed. We also got the stuff mushroom, didn't prefer that either. We also got the Mac and cheese which I recommend, very cheesy and got a little crunch to it and also the truffle mashed was very good and recommend!     I'm giving them 1 star for the horrible service but a 4 star for the food."}
{"text":"Great experience and the service was great! The waiter had been worth Bally's since 1974 and made our experience enjoyable. Be sure to purchase the groupon; no restrictions on days and times for use. The steaks were great."}
{"text":"I give BLT steak 4 stars today. Last night we went there on date night. It was cool bc I had money on the football game and the table we got I could see the game.. Anyways I got the small waygo filet which was good but to me it didn't need all that garlic. I don't really like garlic so if it's a great meat it should stand on its own. I preferred my bf's ribeye. We liked our waitress a lot and the egg bread thing they brought out was like the best part of it!... Overall I had a great time and the steak was very good. But not Ruth's Chris. To me that's still hands down the best steak in Vegas... But I'm gonna keep looking :)"}
{"text":"Char and tony are the best! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Love love love this place! Must go when in vegas! We look my mother in-law here! I will come back every trip!"}
{"text":"Not real happy with our visit. Group of 12, so I understand it's a bit more complicated than a group of 2 or 4. First problem is they say is 40 minutes late. 20 minutes later we only had water on our table and still not a menu or drink order. NOTHING! We get a manager to our table and tell him and he just says \"oh I'm so sorry\" and walked away. The food was good, but they missed a salad and 5 of the steaks were way overcooked. If service was better I would give 4-5 stars but the service was that bad."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise. Great friendly staff, good vibe, nice drinks menu. Started with lobster salad. Very fresh and good and decent amount of lobster. Bone in strip for main. Cooked a hair over what I asked but I was ok with it. Flavour amazing. Sides good. Used a travelzoo deal and they were great about it. Some places aren't. 4.5/5. Recommended."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch/brunch a few times. Every time I've definitely been way underdressed compared to what the staff, and other customers were wearing. Regardless the service was just as gracious and inviting. The popovers are delicious, just expect a wait time since they make them to order, our apps came out before the popovers did. The food is meticulously cooked and plated, so even something as a simple omelette is absolutely amazing. I'd definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Wife and I were staying at Ballys, and had eaten at Gordon Ramsay's steak the night before ( a favorite), and are also very fond of SW at the Wynn. BLT steak is neither of those. The popovers were fantastic. The wife ordered the wagyu skirt, and i ordered the bone-in New York (medium rare). Mine came out gray throughout (well done). Sent it back, and refused any further offerings. The sides were \"meh\". The wife's wagyu was pretty decent, but not worth the 60 or so dollars (again compared to Ramsay's place or SW). We were up-sold by our server throughout the entire dining experience, but the over cooked steak completely ruined it for me. I mean seriously, this is your bread and butter, come on. Will not be re-visiting."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a steak dinner to celebrate the night after completing the rock n roll half. We were staying at Flamingo and wanted close. I was hesitant to go to Ballys as it comes off as \"old\" but BLT had great reviews. We both got the Filet with truffled mash and Brussel sprouts, all of which were amazing. Our servers were very friendly and attentive which added to the experience. It was the perfect mix between casual and dressy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone not looking to pay crazy amounts for a good steak."}
{"text":"After attending a Yelp Elite event here last year, I have been craving BLT's incredible popovers ever since! They are the way to my heart!   We checked in promptly for our reservation and were seated a few minutes later. I will have to say before I venture on to what we ordered and ate that the service here was really poor. We were inside the restaurant close to three hours because we were constantly waiting on our server.   After being seated, we were served with waters and menus. We waited about ten minutes to put in a drink order and receive those delicious popovers. These things are what other bread baskets look up to. Big, warm, crusty, cheesy buns served with softened butter and an overly large sea salt canister that means business.   Once these beauties arrived, we waited another ten minutes for our drinks. When they were delivered we asked our server to please take our order not knowing when we would see him again.   We ordered the tuna tartare, the wedge salad, the filet mignon, bone-in rib eye, Brussels sprouts, loaded baked potato and banana cream pie.   The tuna tartare was incredible. Served up with a soy lime dressing on fresh avocado and a side of potato chips, this dish is the perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I loved the unusual side of chips to eat this dish with. The tuna was fresh and the portion was just right.   The wedge was also delicious, with a nice creamy blue cheese dressing, huge pieces of salty bacon and tasty tomatoes on a large portion of crisp lettuce.   Our steaks were both cooked perfectly with a nice char on each and herb butter that doesn't make you wonder where the additional sauce is. You can order sauces of course, but we didn't as the purists that we are. Both steaks were seasoned well with salt and pepper and an even temperature all the way through.   Our sides were sub par. I thought the Brussels sprouts were overly sweet and needed a little more cooking, the loaded potato was like any other and nothing made it stand out to me.   The banana cream pie was not your typical and one of their most popular dishes. The crust is filled with walnuts and cinnamon, large slices of banana with a cream filling and homemade whip cream and caramel sauce! It was a nice way to end your meal without overly indulging on something really heavy.   Back to our service, our plates and waters were never cleared or filled in a timely manner. Our appetizer dirty dishes sat there until our main course arrived. Our main dirty dishes sat there for thirty minutes once we were done. At one point a manger noticed and came over and cleared them for us. During the time we waited, we watched our server pass us several times and not come over. We finally flagged him down asking for our check because we had been sitting there so long without being noticed or helped.   I know they were busy, but I hope that doesn't mean their service is always lacking. I love the food here but I can't spend three hours at a restaurant when a meal should take about half that.   Needless to say, those popovers might have me coming back and grabbing a seat at their bar."}
{"text":"Immediately greeted upon entering. Reservations at 7 but we got their at 6. They were able to accommodate us. We waited approximately 5 minutes and seated. Excellent customer service from beginning to end. We used our travelzoo coupon with no problem.  Our problem was were extremely exhausted and depleted from being up at 4 am we had to take most of our food to go. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fantastic including the cocktails. The popovers are to die for. The service was excellent. Our waiter Omar was delightful, entertaining and met every need we had before we thought of it. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. My friends said it was great and we found the Travelzoo deal, so we thought we would give it a try. Everything was perfect until they overcooked our Ribeyes. We ordered them medium rare and they came our medium to medium well. I would have said something but since we were already getting a huge discount with the Travelzoo voucher, we decided not to say anything. The bread, appetizers, sides and cocktails were perfect but when I go to a steakhouse that charges this much, I expect that I can ask for a medium rare steak and it comes our medium rare. Next time we are in Vegas, we may or may not try them again. I am not sure yet."}
{"text":"Bartender had a major attitude problem. Artichoke was rock hard sent it back. My chicken was overcooked and so salty it was borderline inedible but I was starving so I ate it anyway. When I brought it to bartender's attention he basically told me I was a liar and that I was the only person to bring this up. I had other people try it and they agreed it was too salty. Not going back."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is good. What you would expect for a high end steak house. The tuna tartare was amazing. I ordered the 6oz wagu filet. I thought it was over seasoned. Meat of that quality doesn't need a lot of flavour/butter/garnish added to it IMO. The reason for 3 stars is because I believe this place is seriously over priced for what you get. I had a much better experience at the other Ramsey steak house in the Paris. 2 appys, 1 drink, 2 steaks  (no sides) was over $200.00."}
{"text":"I would give this a B or B+. It was good but not great. I was expecting better for the price though. I have been to the BLT in NYC and thought NYC was a little better. My wife and I had the porterhouse for two. It was cooked well inside but had some chard burnt tasting areas from the outside on certain  areas. It was just good to okay. I did not like the French onion soup at all. My wife's crab cake was okay (she said it was decent, I thought it tasted \"fishy\"(not fresh) ). The loaded baked potato was good(good sized potato comes with sour cream, bacon, chives and cheese on the side). The truffle mash was strong tasting to me( tasted like I was eating pure garlic but my wife enjoyed it but said two to three bites was enough for her because of the strong flavor). I would say for the price you can find a better expensive steak restaurant. The one in the Belagio in front of the water was way better(can't think of the name right now)."}
{"text":"Great place in Bally's. They serve the bone marrow with the steak. Spread it on the pop over bread and it's like butter. A decadent treat. I like the bar because a person can sit there get dinner and watch the game while having dinner. This is great when dining alone as there is down time while waiting for your steak to cook. Had the Rib Eye, one of the best available in Vegas."}
{"text":"We figure to give BLT Steak House a try since we saw good reviews on Yelp.    When we arrive, we were told that we cannot wait at the bar area because we have 2 children.  I have never been told of that at any $-$$$ Restaurants before...I simply don't understand.  So we Stood Out Side with our little ones for 10min, no sittings. When we got it, we saw only 4 tables filled in the entire restaurant.  What the ... WHY Make us wait for 10mins?  Trying no to think about the outside situation, we ordered what was reviewed so greatly on Yelp, the New York bone in steak, Rib Eye, Mash Potato, and Asparagus.  New York Steak was so salty, there were a couple of bits that i had to remove because i can taste the salt.  Rib Eye Steak was slightly better, but in no way good compare the price charged. Mash Potato was blend...nothing special. Asparagus was overcooked too soft and no taste.  A VERY Disappointment with the price paid $180."}
{"text":"I had the bone in ribeye that was perfectly prepared. The waitstaff were nothing but courteous and they never let my glass go empty.  This was a hit for me I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average not going to lie , I don't usually write negative comments , The girlfriend and I were really excited to eat here as we hardly ever go out to fancy restaurants , we ordered the steak tartar and one of the expensive steaks . I'm very much a steak person  and we ordered medium rare , came out chewy and a little burnt , considering the price you would think the meat would fall off the bone , maybe I was unlucky . The waitress we had just a little fake (like she was over the top  )what really pissed me off was she even looked at our tip before she picked up the bill , which was rude I thought . That food was okay , probably would have had the same steak across at Ellis island for 1 fifth of the cost ."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food, however not comparable to Joe's. The 4 stars is really just for the great service. The salad was over dressed, popovers were a bit on the salty side. The highlight of the meal was the liver mousse with jam...."}
{"text":"I wish this place had better service because the food and drinks are worthy of 5 stars - but the service was horrific!!!  Our party of 4 had a reservation for 7 pm and were seated right away. Once at the table, we were given a complimentary chicken pâté with grilled bread (which none of us liked). After 20 minutes our waiter still hasn't come to our table... My grandfather had to ask a busboy to get the sommelier to order some wine. Another 10 minutes passed and still no menus from our waiter, so my grandmother got up to get our table menus! The waiter finally came around 7:30 and we immediately ordered because we didn't want to wait around any longer.   After we ordered our table was given the famous bread poppers. They were so unique and quite an experience to eat. We wanted to hold on to the poppers and have them at dinner, but multiple times different busboys and our waiter tried to remove them from our table. Honestly not a big deal but it happened 4 or 5 times which was pretty annoying. For appetizers, I got a chance to try the tuna tartare, beet salad, and crab cake, all of which were outstanding.   For my main course I asked our waiter if they could prepare a vegetarian entree, he said yes and then left to ask the chef what the details of the dish would be. He came back and had no clue what he was saying. He said my dish would be prepared with roasted vegetables and linguini. When my entree came, there was no linguini, but a nutty delicious bed of mixed grains and quinoa, grilled asparagus, mushrooms, avocado, and grapefruit - a far cry from \"linguini\". Everyone else in my party enjoyed their steak and seafood and the sides (Brussel sprouts, onion rings, french fries, and gnocchi) were all delicious.   All in all our waiter was very nice but very bad. I don't know if he just new but he sure seemed like it. We had a really nice meal, but this restaurant must improve its service."}
{"text":"The popover was the only thing good about this meal. There was no wait which was awesome since we decided on the spur of the moment. Not really busy. Nice crowd. We were  sat way in the back near the kitchen. Mmmm ok.  My teenage son had the new york strip with fries. I had the crab cake  and creamed spinach since iam not a steak eater or pork chop. The steak was supposed to be well done... know i know but anyway it was very pink on the first cut. Outside was storched/burnt and crisp.I thought maybe another cut into it.. perhaps better.. nope. I mean its toasted black here. Took 8 mins to get someones attention. She tells us that its chargrilled like that...burnt...ok. she finds our waiter. He comes and inspects it. Tells us he can put it back on the grill. Goes back. Comes back burnt more to a crisp. We are good on eating  because im thinking u put my food back on the grill with others food. Although heat disinfects but mmm no.creamed spinch had no seasoning. Very runny. Crab cake was ok but is expected since its a steak house and not seafood. Waiter was friendly. 100 plus lighter and was still hunger when we left."}
{"text":"Wow is what I have to say! My wife and are just about to leave BLT Steakhouse and let me just say that Omar was very food, but our experience with the steaks was amazing!  Let's just say we may meet to be carried out! Wife had the filet mignon and I had new York strip. Both were incredible.  The filet was tender and flavorful.  The strip was even more flavorful and was bone in. Marbelized amazingly as well as perfect amount of fat. Served like never served before.  Enough about the steak,bread was something we have never had and was great as well. BLT steak...you have out done yourselves! See you next time"}
{"text":"Even before this place opened, my boyfriend and I looked forward to dining here one day. We figured our third year anniversary would be a great reason to finally do so.  We arrived slightly early for our dinner reservation and were offered to wait in their little lounge area. After being seated we were quickly greeted by our waiter who was very friendly.  Before dinner they provided some bread with duck pate, which wasn't really my cup of tea. They also gave us two huge and very delicious  pop overs. I have always wanted to try pop overs so this was an awesome chance to do so. They even give you the recipe which is neat.  I hate to say it but I found the decor extremely plain with nothing really to admire. The music was also very bland. I know you are supposed to be there for the food but good music and beautiful design really add to a dining experience.  The steak was everything you would want in a steak. A nice little char on the outside, melts in your mouth and packed full of flavor. The side dishes are a bit on the smaller side but the steaks are so big that it's not like you won't get full. I also loved how all the toppings for the baked potato were separate and were a great amount. I always find myself having to ask for extra toppings while this time I did not.  This was definitely a wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary. I was slightly disappointed they didn't offer a little something for our celebration but we still enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"The popovers were less than the amazing we were told they were.  My husband's Steak was way too salty, and he cooks them better at home.  I got the blackboard gnocchi. it was virtually flavorless.  Sad that Gordon Ramsay associates his name with a place that is sub par.  We were our server's last table and it showed.  We had to request our bill at the bar because he couldn't be bothered to bring it to us after over 20 minutes of waiting.  The only thing good about this restaurant was the joy we got in telling everyone we saw after our visit to go somewhere else instead of BLT."}
{"text":"Go early, sit at the bar and have a drink! We celebrated Christmas/birthday with the family. Wonderful experience, from the popovers to the desert, A+ all the way. The lamb chops were exquisite, and my bone in ribeye was cooked to perfection. When my steak arrived, I thought no way I'm finishing this beast, but I managed to devour the whole thing. Our waitress was sooo nice and friendly, which made the whole experience one to remember. We did Sunday brunch the last trip, and both are well worth the $$$. Just a reminder.....make a reservation in advance for the brunch. And don't eat breakfast before you go! Save room for the good stuff."}
{"text":"Great experience, super attentive and nice staff. My Rib Eye with marrow was so tasty and I loved the brussel sprouts with bacon. Hubby had the same with grilled asparagus and my son loved the tuna. We especially liked the complimentary duck pate with crostini and gruyere pop overs! See you next year!"}
{"text":"Wow. Never yelped for a steak house.  But now I am.  Delicious. Perfect beginning to end. First the best hot popovers ever. Omar was amazing and helpful. I ordered  the filet butterflied almost medium and it was perfect! Than the sauces -they should be their own food group!  Love my salad (chopped dressing fab) and the kale side. Too full for a dessert but the warm brownie squares they gave at it were the percent end.  Thank you for a wonderful meal!!!!"}
{"text":"SUPERB! DELICIOUS! I had fish and my husband had steak. Their signature Popovers are huge and to die for. Don't forget to try the AMAZING chocolate tart or cheesecake too!  Thank you to the AWESOME waiters, especially Hugo. COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEFS!  Thank you to Bally's and Caesars Entertainment for our AWESOME VIP Veterans Day dinner.  It's an experience we'll NEVER FORGET."}
{"text":"Lovely dining experience! On vacation, purchased a groupon to dine here. From The outside never would have know to come here. They give you these great popovers (cheesy bread. Awesome. You can take extra home for $2 each. Worth it) the menu is pricey which is to be expected. Food was great, well worth it, servers were friendly and personable. It's upscale, but not overly pretentious. Very savory meal! Thanks BLT steak!"}
{"text":"First class service and atmosphere. Anthony has been our server for years and does his best to make any adjustments we ask for. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We enjoyed the stuffed mushroom caps with our steak"}
{"text":"What a wonderful new addition to Las Vegas. We had dinner  on July 25, 2014.  And nobody in our party was disappointed. From start to finish, everything was amazing! We ordered a few of the specialty drinks that started our dinner experience off on the right path. It continued with the Chef's complimentary appetizers, and we had the artichoke and beet salad too. I can't pick a favorite since they all were great!  Maybe put the duck pate on the menu?   Two different steaks ordered, The bone in rib eye, and strip steak. The strip steak did come out medium instead of medium rare, but was too good to send back.  The rib eye was melt in your mouth tender. The lobster was also ordered and I was told was delicious as all that was left was its sad empty shell. Also enjoyed was the asparagus, Hen of the woods mushrooms and a perfect baked potato.  Did I mention the peanut butter mousse? WOW....  We were lucky to meet and talk with  the  Executive Chef and give him and his staff our compliments. Great Job!!  I will be back"}
{"text":"Wow! where do I start?! start to finish this has been by far the best dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. The food was exquisite, the service was impeccable, and the place is gorgeous and inviting. Rudy the manager stop at nothing to make our dining experience one of a kind. I dined here with my two children and they absolutely love it as well. We started off with the popovers which came with a cute little recipe on the back. These popovers are melt in your mouth buttery cheesy goodness made in heaven. For appetizers we ordered the bacon which was phenomenal and the Ahi tuna which left me speechless. The waitress highly recommended the Ahi tuna and sincerely it's the best I Ahi tuna that I have ever had in my entire life. Fresh, tasty, and simply delicious. As our entrée we the fillet and my son had the salmon. Phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The entire dining experience was just phenomenal. Their cocktails were also great! I cannot wait to go back! Thank you BLT and Thank you Rudy! My kids and I are so grateful!"}
{"text":"Warning!!! Do not go to this steak house and order seafood. I had a craving for some oysters so after the waiter recommendation I ordered the seafood platter for 2 and expected nice big plump oysters, shrimp, king crab, and lobster but instead got the total opposite. For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos). The popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides. The portion of the mash potato was a joke - 2 spoons and it was gone; how can that be enough for even one person let alone sharing.  Same for the asparagus and mushrooms. Spending over $400 plus tip we left feeling unfulfilled and hungry."}
{"text":"1st time here and had high expectations compared to eating at Old Homestead in Caesars.  Service was above average but did not stand out.   Ordered their signature cocktail, the BLT, and thought it was pretty good. For food I only ordered the bone-in ribeye.   Before the steak came I was served \"the popper\" (bread) which I didn't try, however being a diamond member, I was also served the duck pâté, cheese bread, and charcuterie.  The duck pâté with bread was unbelievable and very bold and strong. The cheesebread was light and good as well, very good contrast to the bread and duck pâté. The charcuterie was as expected and didn't stand out.  For the main course I ordered the ribeye medium, but was given to me medium rare, so I sent it back to be cooked to order. I have to say the steak was over charred which someone else posted about ina previous review. The steak wasn't melt in your mouth as I would've expected being a USDA prime steak. It was a good steak, but the fat and the flavor (I had no sauce) was nothing to comment about. The bone marrow added flavor to the steak, however I could not comment about the butter which was melted and gone since I sent the steak back.  Overall, for being a restaurant known for its steak, it was nothing to rave about. I'd say I most likely won't be back to spend $65 on a ribeye steak   that I thought was average at best."}
{"text":"Porterhouse steak was the best we've ever had!  Order the peppercorn sauce - perfect for the stake. Popover rolls were delicious too. Mashed potatoes were good not great. Caesar salad was very good."}
{"text":"This is probably  the worse steak house in Las Vegas at this price point..we ordered  the 24oz bone in rib eye steak which we shared...the meat was a very bad cut, hard to cut and chew when the steak came out it was sliced up there was a sauce that came with it that was terrible...this was my husband birthday and we were so disappointed will never go again or recommend  to anyone"}
{"text":"The BLT restaurant was, overall, a pleasant experience. We made reservations online and when we arrived we were seated promptly. They brought duck pate, which was fantastic, followed by their amazing bread (Seriously was my favorite part.) Drinks were on point. My husband and I both ordered the wedge salad and were not disappointed. We then both ordered the 10 ounce filet, and that probably was our least favorite part of the meal, although still good. We just figured when you pay $56 for steak it should be absolute perfection, and it was not. It was good, but definitely left us wanting something better. The ambience was the perfect steak house ambience. And the staff was attentive and friendly (although our server was a little pushy at times when we didn't order extra sides or dessert.)"}
{"text":"First time dining at BLT. I'm a local and saw a Groupon discount so thought I'd explore a new steakhouse. The service was 5*, Javier and Felipe were awesome. The cheese popovers a hit, hot and flakey. Roasted beet salad was delicious.  We enjoyed the Branzino and Lemon chicken. Overall very delicious and we'll return."}
{"text":"Okay food, great atmosphere, great service. It is what you expect of a fine dining place but the food left us disappointed (twice). The french fries were over seasoned in garlic and so was the steak. We left the restaurant with the garlic taste and it would not go away hours after the meal. The server told us to order without garlic next time and we did on the next visit, still they had put on it and mentioned that is pre-marianted. Why?!?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Son... This shit right hereeeeeee....!!! Wack. Ok... Let's get into it. If you advertise a VIP section with food, then please be prepared to feed more than the first 5 people in line. Next, please provide a nice ambiance between the two parties. Finally, at least be consistent on whom can come into the VIP section. Currently... This is some bs..."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. They don't just give you bread as starters but instead Pop overs and Chicken pate. And steaks are cooked to perfection. Afterward you can walk across the restaurant into the Ritz Carlton and get dessert there."}
{"text":"Took my mom for Mother's Day after seeing a show at Paris.  The popovers were outstanding.  Flaky, Cheesy, Salty Deliciousness.  We shared the Bone In Rib-eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked.  Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat.  I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib-eye, but this one had a large one running through it.  It was overall a fatty piece of steak.  The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price.  The service was slow even though there were many servers present.  Did I mention the popovers were amazing?  Probably would  not go back."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday will high expectations but it turned South as soon as they delivered the amuse bouche.  It was a duck liver pate that came in little jars, which was good but there was a large shard of glass in it that I bit down on.  The server said it happens alot and got a manger that came over and said he was sorry and gave me a coupon for 20% off our next visit?  My wife ordered a coke and then we waited for both the Coke and bread service and waited and waited.  Eventually we had to ask the server assistant for both.  Meanwhile a table that sat nearly 30 minutes after us,  got their appetizers and then entrees before we got our bread and wife's coke.  I then spoke with the manager again about the slow service (it wasn't busy) and he sent out some oysters for the wait.  We had a medium rare ribeye that came out medium well and that was the end for me.  I told the manager to keep his 20% coupon because we would never come back, but he wouldn't take it,  so we gave it to the six top of guys next to us.   I would definitely not go on a Sunday night because it is clearly the B-team, from the kitchen all the way up to management.  There are so many other choices in Las Vegas and as a local, I would stay away from this tourist trap."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, tuna tartare, creamed spinach, foie gras were all top notch. This would have been 5 stars if service were not slow, inattentive at the beginning of service. I will say they triple sat our waiter at 615 when we arrived. Champagne arrived warm to the table and we had to ask for champagne flutes. Water ran dry and dirty dishes were not immediately cleared. It was vastly different the night before at Gordon Ramsey's where service is top notch."}
{"text":"The week prior to going to Vegas I saw Travelzoo had a special for BLT steak.  $115...on the travelzoo it did say it had a bunch conditions to choose from like 2 appetizers,2 entrees, dessert with an up to value on each that totaled up to $208  I normally find those to be annoying but since I have been to BLT  restaurants, I found it to be a good value.  I was happy when I arrived to find out those conditions were thrown out and it was straight credit of $208.   The wife had a large and meaty crab cake for an appetizer and I had the tuna tartae, tuna and avocado were fresh. A complimentary appetizer of duck pate with a jam (or jelly) was a welcome treat as well. Entree wise she had the branzino and I had the filet (medium) and an add-on of crab. She really enjoyed her branzino. My steak was cooked perfectly.  Sides were hen of the woods mushrooms (this is a must order for me at any BLT with it on the menu) and  fingerling potatoes which were excellent.   SIDENOTE: There is something about BLT that I just love their filet. I had ny strip one time that I did not really enjoy so I have stuck with Filet since then.  Wait staff was very friendly and provided great service. Any recommendations or explanation of an item she provided with great knowledge.  We had quite a few cocktails unfortunately I don't remember the name but mine had tequila and mezcal.  Personal Pet Peeve: This is why it 4 star and not 5.  I know this occurs at steakhouses often but I still don't like getting charged for steak sauces. It just seems like a nickel & dime type of thing when you are spending $100 a person imo.  At the end of the day our bill came to about $265 after tax & 20% tip."}
{"text":"Food out of this world good. Travelzoo deal is an absolute steal. Get it then gamble at the tables after since they have lower minimums. Never had gone to Bally's but not bad! Had an awesome drag show nearby which was awesome.  Great steak and cocktails, the truffle mash was like omg. Fabulous selection of oysters. Um yeah I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love a good steak house, from the romantic setting to the perfectly made steaks and the amazing service, Im almost always guaranteed to have a memorable dinner and dinner at BLT steak was no exception.  The service was impeccable and every dish we ordered was as flavorful as the next. Even the bread  was amazing. Ok ok in all fairness they were these delicious pillows of gruyere  \"popovers\". The crust was crispy and the inside was so soft. Oh so good.  I had one cocktail with dinner and that was delicious! It was a spicy margarita. Only a small kick to it but tasted fresh as hell!  My steak came out sizzling and at the perfect temperature, medium. We got a couple sides, veggies and truffle mashed potatoes. Those potatoes were something else. All this awesome truffle flavor. Seriously you have to try them! My absolute favorite part of the meal is always dessert, because I always have room for dessert. LOL. I have to recommend trying the soufflé crepe. It was interesting but crazy good! It had a passion fruit topping. The tart and sweetness of it complimented the delicateness of the soufflé.  Loved it! Simply put, amazing dinner! The service was on point too!  Check it!!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse on the Strip so far!!!!! Casual setting where they will allow you to wear your jeans :) The boys and I thought our medium steaks were cooked to perfection! Loved the large side portions and the service! Would definitely recommend even if you are not staying at Bally's."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that it's nestled at Bally's fool you, this reasurant is the real deal! We had dinner there on a Saturday night and it wasn't overly crowded. The restaurant is new, fresh and has great ambiance. The service is A+ and food is even better. From the table top bread that is guaranteed to fill you up before your steak is served to the delicious side dishes, this steak house is solid. We ordered filets and they were all cooked to our liking and it was delicious. My only negative of the night would be the truffle mashed potatoes. Sometimes going simple is the way to go, our group of four all agreed the regular mashed potatoes were tasiter than the truffle mashed potatoes but it doesn't mean the truffle was bad, just not the best option.  We ordered appetizers, cocktails, salads, steak, sides and desserts and we were all pleased with our meal. Well worth every penny. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Awesome high quality food.  :Love the selection and the cocktails are delicious! Staffs thinks ahead and beyond, fantastic guest service.  Love the fact that everyone looks like they wanted to be there and taking care of guest needs is important."}
{"text":"Which steakhouse is better: BLT, Del Frisco's or Capital Grille (of my 3 Charlotte favorites)?  It depends; they each have their own distinct differences (not a cop out answer, I promise).  BLT gets 4.5 stars, rounding up to 5 for: fabulous ambience, stellar service, and delectable food.   FABULOUS AMBIENCE. BLT is inside the Ritz Carlton in Uptown and takes a trendy, modern twist on traditional steakhouses.  The ceilings are really high, which does amplify sound and makes hearing a little difficult but is aesthetically grand.  The dining room is bright, without the standard white linen table cloths, another break from dark traditional steakhouses.    The main downfall is the dining area is small so you're a lot closer to other patrons, which can feel cramped and be distracting, especially if you're seated in the half booths along the back wall.  We have been twice; the first time we sat along the wall where we felt crammed in like sardines, the second, we were seated in the middle near the center flower arrangement (much better).    STELLAR SERVICE. It's the Ritz; they lived up to their reputation of excellence.  We made the mistake of coming during Restaurant Week (\"RW\") the first time that we came (we didn't order from the limited RW menu so we didn't reap any RW benefits) and the restaurant was packed to capacity.  Regardless, the service was as courteous, prompt and attentive as when we came the second time on a Thursday evening.  The only difference is that we weren't served the delicious chicken patè during the RW visit.  Both times, the maitre d' appeared to ask about our dining experience, a hallmark of stupendous service because they are prepared to proudly stand behind their cuisine and service.  For those of you who have unsavory experiences, I encourage you to voice them; they will do what they can to remediate your negative impression. That's how they maintain their brand.  DELECTABLE FOOD. Overall, the cuisine is marvelous and worth the hefty price tag.  We've had:  _________ALCOHOL.  Heavy alcohol pour on both our Moscow Mule and my custom concoction.  _________DIVINE.   ++ yellowtail hamachi. The yellowtail is fresh, perfectly thinly sliced and served on a lemony bed of fresh avocado mixed with a ponzu sauce.  The combination of the buttery from the avocado and the sweetness from the yellowtail and lemony undertone is foodgasmic; one of my all-time favorite dishes.  ++ bone-in ribeye. They serve their steaks on a skillet along with a garlic flower (I like to spread it over my steak) and a sauce of your choice (the BLT signature sauce mixed with the herbed butter is Uh-mazing).  The beef is tender, juicy and definitely remarkably savory.  The first time we came, our server told us that they don't carry A1 (killjoy for my BF) so we brought our own the second time.  Our second server, bemused by our adamance, informed us that they can get it from the Ritz side next time we come (phew!  Because spilling A1 in my purse would suck!).   ___________REALLY GOOD.  ++ complimentary chicken patè. It's very dense and flavorful, the saltiness is meant to be dispersed onto the bread underneath.  My BF doesn't usually like patè but enjoyed it here.  ++ Caesar salad.  The dressing is the perfect blend of creaminess, lemony with a hint of anchovies. The freshly grated cheese adds the perfect layer of saltiness.  ++ crab and apple salad.  The sweetness of the fresh crab meat goes well with the semi-sweet tanginess of the vinaigrette and tartness from the apples.   ++ shrimp cocktail. The succulent shrimps are fresh and the cocktail sauce has the perfect flavorful kick to it.   ++ oysters. They melt in your mouth like butter and are very fresh without the briny after taste.   ____________PASS.  ++ complimentary popovers.  I don't like them in general;  I prefer traditional bread.    DIFFERENCES. Each national chain has its idiosyncratic flair and is good for different reasons.  It really boils down to how you like your steak prepared and what kind of ambience you are seeking. Personally, I like CG for its idyllic patio and lobster bisque; BLT for its yellowtail hamachi and garlic flower/herbed butter/BLT special sauce combo; and DF for its marinated and super tender steak.   BLT. Trendy upscale contemporary twist; has a fusion undertone; steak served on a skillet, has garlic flower, herbed butter and delicious steak sauce. Pre-dinner popovers and chicken patè.  No patio.  Del Frisco's.  More traditional upscale; has French influence; steak is thoroughly marinated and served with outside layer of seasoning. Pre-dinner sesame bread. Patio seems like an after thought. Capital Grille.  More casual traditional country club vibe; steak is marinated but served bare. Pre-dinner bread basket. I love the patio there.   Overall, if you're looking for a special occasion venue in Charlotte, the dining experience is commensurate to the price. You do get what you pay for, which is a memorable and delicious meal at the Ritz."}
{"text":"This place was just OK in my books. I've been to some pretty legit steak restaurants and this place just did ok. The bread basket was nice, the liver pate on the house was actually pretty killer. I don't always like pate due to its gamey nature but this was just creamy and delicious. The cut of meat I ordered was the Filet and my co-worker ordered the Rib-eye. They were both cooked perfectly however, my steak was crazy salty. My husband and I don't eat a ton of salt any more and this way beyond the normal savoriness of a steak. My co-worker however, did really enjoy his steak. They do have a huge wine selection which was nice. Also, they don't play with their prices. I thought it was overly expensive for the quality of food. There were other items on the menu. Maybe I'll give it another shot when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best steak house I've ever been to. The steak fell apart in my mouth and as for the popovers... Wow. It's a bit pricey but worth every cent."}
{"text":"An unexpected surprise! I was visiting Las Vegas after seeing Hamilton and wanted a fine dining experience after the show and stumbled across BLT. We were a party of 4 and all the dishes were flavorful and cooked to perfection. Even though the food was nearly perfect, what really elevated our experience was the service from Roxanne and our food running Jamie.  No one had to ask for a refill, they had extension menu knowledge, they were thoughtful and courteous and they made us feel extremely welcomed.   There's a robust list of options in Las Vegas and unfortunately, pretty modern restaurants are always the hottest buzz however this hidden gem at Bally's was a 5-star from start to finish!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary there last Saturday, August 29th. Order the boned rib eye medium rare. It was cooked right but the meat was tough, chewy & dry. Very disappointed. Also, they didn't even give us an anniversary dessert. My friends went there a week before and their experience with the beef was the same. I would definitely not go back. Should have stuck to our Ruth Chris reservations!!"}
{"text":"A very good surprise.  We stopped here on a whim and had a fine lunch.  A great burger and superb popovers."}
{"text":"Popover bread was really good, but that was the highlight of my meal. It was late and I was in town on business and just wanted a decent bite to eat. I got the Wagyu Burger and some onion rings.  The onion rings were good but under seasoned (basically no seasoning). The burger was cooked to the right temp (med rate) but again lacked seasoning, and the protein while having a great texture was over whelmed by the bread, onion lettuce, etc. The bacon wasn't crisp and went entirely unnoticed until a piece fell out. The burger basically disintegrated due the juiciness of the burger and moisture of the veg. I ended up eating it with a fork, but didn't finish either.  Really underwhelmed for a 40 dollar meal."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great steak! Sides and bread! Will totally go back, one of the best steaks I've ever had.   Went back, same result, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"My porterhouse was really good! Also the cream spinach and the truffled mash were good. Too bad the location at Ballys isn't that great, not as lively and trendy like STK and other steakhouses in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was just an ok experience. For the money, it was a disappointment and should have been much better. We gave out group of 6, 2 hours and 15 minutes to dine before we had to see a show. The restaurant was less than half full when we arrived and we were seated promptly. Everything started nice and our server made some suggestions on food and drinks. Our wine was excellent and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We started with the crab cake appetizer. It was very mussy and not crisp on the outside like it should have been. As soon as you touched it, it fell apart. Not the end of the world, but was hoping for better. The pop overs they serve are perfect. Wedge salad: Average at best with very little dressing or blue cheese. I don't like a lot of dressing on my salad, but this was about a tablespoon for a fairly large salad. Average. Still at this point while we were not wow'd, it wasn't terrible. This is where things stopped. Our server stopped coming over and we noticed several other tables had their dinners. It got to the point that we had to flag down a waiter and ask to have someone talk to us. A manager finally came over and we asked what happened to our food. He apologized and said he would check on it. By the time it came, we were now in a hurry to finish eating and go right to the show (luckily in the same hotel). When they brought our food they indicated it was our fault since one of our diners had requested a well done filet. I would never eat a steak this way, but I have reluctantly cooked them this way for friends. I do the same as BLT, butterfly them. They said it takes them 40-45 minutes to cook a 10 oz. butterflied filet. Really, in a 1500 degree oven you brag about? I guess I need to show them how to cook a steak. The steaks were all perfect once we finally got them. Tried a filet and rib-eye (both medium rare) and no complaints what so ever. The meat was 5 star. The manager offered to buy us desert on him, but at this point we just had time to run to the show. When we are spending over $100 per person for a meal, I expect something special. This was not any where near what I have experienced at similar restaurants."}
{"text":"We are in Las Vegas for a convention this week, and it's a rare moment that we get to dine sans our amazing but boisterous kiddos, so chose BLT Steak after reading the great reviews. The hostess seating us was very nice. But our waiter Omar was another story. Note to restaurant: don't offer a Travelzoo coupon if your staff is going to treat us like garbage when we use them!!  We didn't know that we had to tell the hostess about the travelzoo so when we told our waiter before we even ordered, he immediately changed his tone. Then he lectured us about how we had to tell the hostess. While you can use it for anything you want, there are a few exceptions. Unfortunately wagyu is also not allowed which was one of the reasons why we chose to eat here. Oh well - but that's not the reason for the bad review.  As the waiter proceeded to take our order, he did ask if we had an allergy. We said no, but we have very strong preferences and dislikes, so please let us know if there are any strong flavors in food like wasabi, horseradish, onions, curry, etc. We then ordered two appetizers: the Tuna Tarter and the Steak Tarter - and asked if there was anything like that in them - he said no. Well, of course the Steak Tarter was swimming in a brown sauce suspension I asked him what it was and he said \"traditional garnishes\". I pressed further and he said \"mustard\". So apparently us listing every strong spicy flavor known to man didn't clue him in that he should have told us about mustard that wasn't listed as a flavor on the menu. Had to send that back, but the Tuna Tarter was excellent.  We also has amuse bouche of liver pate with some kind of gel with 2 small pieces of toast. Not great. Textures of runny pate with gel made it taste like snot. Don't really like starting off with that profile. Then popovers (which usually are my fav) were overcooked to a crisp and really dense inside. First time I didn't finish a popover.  Then came the entrees. We ordered a filet mignon and bone in ribeye. Both were good, but the ribeye was too lean and didn't have a cap on it. It was somehow trimmed to just the eye. Never had that issue at a steakhouse before. It did come with a small piece of marrow and garlic - which helped. Filet was good though.  Side dishes were comically small for $12 each. They are not sharing sides. We ordered the truffled mashed and seasonal special cauliflower. Cauliflower was disappointing. Just tastes like the ones I bake in an oven - there was no brown butter or lemon zest as described.  We then ordered the peanut butter chocolate mousse - which is not a mousse. It was so dense and hard that I almost needed a knife to cut through it. The bowl of sorbet was like they emptied an entire container into a bowl. Just really odd. Could have done with 1/2 the amount at 1/2 the price.  Drinks we had two mojitos and one wine spritzer. Asked for fruit in the spritzer but the bar doesn't have any - just garnishes like limes, orange slices, cherries. Odd, but okay.  But the real issue we had was service. The waiter never checked on us. I had an empty glass of water for over an hour. He was just literally throwing food on our table and walking away with no explanation of what anything is. No asking if the food was fine. At one point, he stepped on my foot when putting food down and didn't even apologize. I understand that maybe people don't tip right on a coupon or voucher, but we weren't those people. And to treat us like garbage was a really bad way to earn a tip. We did end up giving almost 15% tip because my husband doesn't really like giving less than that. But if it was up to me, it would have been a 0 - we've had better service at Denny's.  Another table near us also has a Travelzoo and that waiter was great to them. I wished we had him instead of Omar - who instead literally ruined our date night. I would not return to BLT Steak, and I do not recommend this restaurant until they train their staff properly."}
{"text":"Not my favorite steak house in Vegas. The food was subpar, and nothing about anything we ordered was memorable or anything I could really brag about. Definitely a very large restaurant which provides more privacy then one could every really want. Staff was friendly and very attentive. If you are looking for REALLY good steak this place is not the spot. Prices are very expensive for what was provided and I didn't exactly leave feeling satisfied. 2 stars for service and ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a moderately-priced steakhouse. Expensive is not necessarily better. Fancier indeed though.    The GOOD: The complimentary appetizers were good, toasted bread crisps with liver spread and their special bread popovers. The service and ambiance was wonderful. Romantically lit and not too loud. My cup was never empty that night and I drank a lot too. Staff were attentive.    The BAD: Each bite of my bone-in ribeye steak took me to salt city. Even the spare ribs were on the salty side. The steak was coarse as well, hard to chew. It wasn't dry but coarse/rubbery. Truffle mash potatoes was good but almost headed to salt city too. I was gagging by the end of my meal. When the manager came by to ask if the temperature of my steak was good, I said it was ok. but I also wanted to blow up and say wth I paid so much for this salty piece of steak. Idk if it was due to the butter on top or what but it was salty af. The bone marrow that came with it was good.   2 stars for the good service and ambiance. I can eat a lot of almost anything, so I was surprised this expensive meal literally had me gagging. I prefer to endure shitty service with awesome food over shitty food with awesome service, cuz I go to restaurants for the food."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for happy hour..NO ONE asked for our order. The bartenders didn't even look at us. When I went up to ask if someone could take our drink orders, the bartender said \"there's no server for you but I can give you a menu\" then he preceeded to say \"where you're sitting is actually only for people who's waiting to eat at the restaurant...this place is EMPTY. The restaurant doesn't even open until 5 and happy hour starts at 4...so who the hell are they serving?? Horrible customer service and to think, I was going to eat here after eating at Gordon Ramsay's STEak last night. The light skinned bartender hasn't come around after giving us horrible attitude. I'm actually going to complain to their manager. Horrible service. Your drinks weren't even that great. Go to GORDON RAMSAYS STEAK INSTEAD. I'll post more"}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing! Service was even better than the food. Ask for King Kojo as your server."}
{"text":"Now this place is awesome! The food was top notch while the portions were way larger than i expected. I had the tuna tartar on top of avacado with a great sauce for appetizer. The short ribs looked like they came off of a dinosaur. The flavor was unbelievable.  Best ive ever had. I also suggest the prime rib. After trying it there, nowhere else can compare. Great experience! Our waiter was Jaun. He was great. Couldnt ask for better. His suggestions definitely put us in the right direction. Great experience. Me and my fiancee together came up to about $200. Pricey..but money well spent!"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience for a very pricy steak. We waited over 60 minutes to get a Luke warm steak. We were already pressing the clock to get to our show so not able to send back even after argument with staff on why the butter won't even melt on our steaks.  The sides were small just for one individual were most steak houses you can share. After 700.00 + tip my friends and I were not impressed what so ever with this establishment."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday. How disappointed we were. 1st the wine. Same stuff we get at the grocery store for $15 they want $75. 20 minutes wait from salad to meal. The steak was cold!!!  The lobster we ordered ended up being the claw meat. The menu said lobster and they serve the claw knowing everyone is thinking tail. We didn't see our waiter, Juan, but on rare occasions. No butter served with what they call lobster. Bottom line is, The prices are obscene for the service and the food.  There are so many great steak houses here in Vegas. Don't waste your time or money here. Highly recommend Galagers  at NYNY if you want a great meal while spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"The service and food is incredible. Alie the server is friendly while being professional. One of the top steak houses in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to BLT steakhouse which is located in the Bally's casino for dinner and it started off really well. They serve you this amazing complimentary pate and then they follow up with some freshly baked popovers which was way better than any bread I have ever been served in a restaurant. Then it just started to be ok after that. I ordered the shrimp cocktail which came with 4 large shrimp nicely presented but the cocktail sauce tasted like something out of a jar nothing special. My husband ordered the filet which was the only steak that wasn't dry aged which he doesn't like and it was ok. He ordered the macaroni and cheese as a side dish because everything is a la carte and they never brought that so he had just \"steak\". So since that's all we had we ordered 2 desserts. The banana cream pie was pretty good it had a nice nut crust which I liked and the lemon cheesecake which was so small considering it was $12. Yikes! I would probably go back because the popover was that good."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience with an offer from Travel Zoo. Service by Javier and Oscar- impeccable. Good timing perfectly. Ordered crab cakes, Caesar salad, filet, and truffle mash and it was absolutely delicious. I know it's a little hidden in a corner, but absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here... Horrible is a nice way of describing this place... It started with our waiter Omar who one does not listen to what we have ordered, and two continued to bring us the wrong orders all night, and made us keep the wrong order...  It started off simple we wanted two long islands to drinks and Omar brings us tequila and tells us to just drink them.  My husband ordered the short ribs and Omar says no you need to get lamb y husband said no thank you He just wanted to try the short ribs... Well Omar brought my husband lamb instead of what he ordered. I ordered the capped mushrooms and even asked before hand how it is prepared... Omar stated that they are stuffed with other mushrooms and oven baked with cheese.  when Omar brought the mushrooms to the table the were brunt crisp and unedible... When i asked them why the were so brunt he said that's how they come and took off.  At this point we didn't even want to make a stink that everything was wrong about the whole dinner and experience so we asked for our check, we were just ready to pay and leave it took 30 minutes to recieve a bill... I explained to Omar that we had show tickets and were going to be late and he brushed his hand up saying ya i'll get there and ignored us. I finally called  over a manger to bring us our bill i did not want to ruin our only date night out complianing or be upset so we just got our check paid and went on our way... But since I did'nt get to speak to a manger I hope the owner reads how horrible the service and food was... not happy with this place at all. Too bad yelp doesn't have a zero star... I  had better service at a burger king then this place...."}
{"text":"If you like meat BLT is a spot in Vegas that you shouldn't miss!  Our food was terrific and the steaks tender and juicy - go with a couple of friends and get the Porter House to share.  All I can say about that is WOW!  The cocktail list was inventive and far from the usual and everyone who had one of the special cocktails enjoyed them.  Sergio our waiter was terrific and attentive without being bothersome - we really enjoyed our dinner at BLT."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!  Came here for NYE dinner with my parents. The food here is amazing and I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  --Popovers - wow, these are great! Cheesy bread served as their complimentary appetizer. I could have been happy just eating these with no other food lol.  --Waygu style filet - great! I usually don't like my steak medium rare but because of the quality, I went for it. It was the right choice! Lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and that is all it needed! All of us got the same thing and all agreed that is how a filet should taste.  --Side Dishes - we got truffle mash, mushrooms, and Brussel Sprouts. I have had better Brussels, but the mushrooms and truffle mash were amazing! The truffle mash was for sure the highlight and they were almost puréed. So so good. A must get if you are dining here.  Overall a gem hidden in the Bally's hotel. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"The steaks were amazing!  The service was fabulous!  It's a must at least once. I must admit, it's pricey.  We had a great deal from Travelzoo, without the deal, I would not be back. For full price, I think there are a few other places I would choose over this restaurant, but i would do it again for the Travelzoo deal. The steaks was just phenomenal.  Party of four - and we all loved the steaks!  I had the filet mignon, hubby ordered the  and other couple shared a 32 oz ribeye."}
{"text":"We made our reservation through OpenTable & had noted on there that we be using our Groupon deal ($100 value w/ purchase value of $69).  Our dining experience was great & food was delightful.    :: VENUE/SERVICE ::  Located inside of Bally's Hotel past the Jubilee Show area. When we arrived last Saturday evening we presented our hostess (who greeted us warmly) our Groupon deal & our Total Rewards card (for additional discounts!). We were seated pretty quickly & our server Javier was very attentive along with all the other servers kept an eye out for water glasses to be filled at all times :) Wonderful service. Comfortable seating & ambiance. Restaurant lighting was dim for a nice romantic setting.    :: FOOD ::  Everything came out in a very timely matter.   COMPLIMENTARY DUCK LIVER CROSTINI   (5/5)  - The creaminess of the pate & jam was so well balanced together. Mmmm~  COMPLIMENTARY 2 BAKED POPOVERS   (5/5)  - Moist & fluffy w/ the fresh butter & salt. Free recipe to take home too!  SYRAH   (5/5)  LOBSTER COBB SALAD    (5/5)  - They split the salad into 2 plates for us & the salad was refreshing & yummy!  12 OZ AMERICAN WAGYU RIBEYE  (5/5)  - Melts in your mouth!  PORT WINE BRAISED SHORT RIBS   (4.5/5)  - Very tender, tasty & smothered with thick sauce  COMPLIMENTARY 2 MINI BROWNIE BITES   (4.5/5)  - perfect soft bites & it was not super sweet at all.   I'll definitely be back to BLT in my future Vegas visits!"}
{"text":"Rib eye was great, the steak sauce was awful... one of the worse housemade steak sauces I've tasted.  Had this sweet tang to it... tasted like cheap bbq sauce.  Fortunately the steak had no need for steak sauce.   Lobster was a bit on the mushy side but had good flavor. The popovers were good but I dont understand this \"OMG best bread ever!\" claims. The fries were very disappointing.  When you charge $10+ for sides they should be special and worthy of that price tag.  Envy's Parmesan truffle fries and Whiskey creamed corn come to mind immediately.  These fries were not special at all and I tasted stale cooking oil on them.   The service was good but the waiter was overbearing with his push to get us to order drinks, appetizers, desserts. Here is one such exchange we had: Waitor: what would you like to drink? Me: water is fine, thank you Waitor: are you sure, we have some nice cocktails Me: no thank you, Ive had enough alcohol already today Waitor: well we also have some nice non-alchoholic drinks Me: no thank you, I have not drunk enough water while I have been in Vegas"}
{"text":"We enjoy a good steak and this place was a real treat on our first happenstance visit. Not busy on a Friday night with a real friendly waitress who really knew the menu (do not recall her name but moved here in 2014 from Michigan).    The free bread puffs are killer as is the goose liver.  You really do not need apps when this surprise arrives and is very filling.  Steaks were cooked perfectly and the fat was well trimmed.  We enjoyed both the aged and standard steaks.    Our favorite steak was at Gibson's in Chicago but our list has now been updated to place BLT at the top."}
{"text":"This is sòoooo good!  We had the veal chop and the bone in ribeye. TOTALLY worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Always stay at Bally's. main reason is BLT Steakhouse. Had dinner reservations at seven but because of the football playoffs my son and friends kept changing the time of dinner. We finally ate about nine. Told my son the bone in ribeye' are probably all gone or last of the left overs. Got one as usual. Good but not great.  I went alone a couple nights later cause I wanted to try their lobster dinners. First of all don't order seafood as a main entry in a Steakhouse. Really really bad"}
{"text":"I ended up at BLT Steak because I waited too long to make a reservation at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but it was a fine mistake in retrospect. The meal started off by our waiter bringing out a complimentary duck liver mousse which was very nice and of course the popovers which I found delightful. The popovers were light and airy and a great change of pace to the run of the mill bread baskets you tend to see. I shared a salad with my dining companion after that and then it was the steaks. I had the 32 ounce porterhouse and they had the filet. The porterhouse was right up there with the best steaks I've ever had, tender, juicy and full of flavor. The filet was equally tender, but lacked a little of the flavor of the porterhouse and while that might be enough for some to bump it to 4 stars, the quality service coupled with one of the handful of best steaks I've ever had is enough for me to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent, not a complaint. Travelzoo had a $208 voucher for $115, so we figured we would try it out. The food, service drinks and atmosphere were fantastic. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The steaks were good, the sides were great, and our server Roxanne, was phenomenal! This restaurant is tucked away in Bally's and may not be in a trendy location like the Cosmo or Caesar's but it's definitely worth it. Vegas prices for the food but we felt it was worth it. Would recommend this to friend and family."}
{"text":"I don't write bad review, but I will try to keep it simple.  Any bad experience I encountered I tend to just let it wash off and not go there again.    In this case, I would like to dine at BLT Steak again (the best steak!), I just wanted to address some positive and uncomfortable experiences we had there that evening.  We came for dinner last week for our early anniversary dinner.  It was recommended to us by our good friend.    Pros: The food was delicious & the steak I have ordered was on point!  Kudos to the Chief!  They did an amazing job!   I can't praise enough about the servers, they were are all amazing.  From the beginning to the end.  Uncomfortable: The restaurant manager came by our table to see if everything was ok.  I couldn't help but to stare at what was oblivious, her tatas!  Which was leaning over half of our table.  I felt so uncomfortable, and knowing that she asked a question waiting for a response.  My husband kind of stop what he was doing and just stared down.  I don't know if this was done intentionally or just her manners, it's really bothering.  I had no choice to answer avoiding eye contacts."}
{"text":"Came here with my love the last night of our vacation. It's a very romantic atmosphere. It's a bit on the pricey side( $30-$70 a plate) but well worth it. Our server was Javier, was amaizing. They gave us a delicious cheese bread, it was like nothing else I've tasted before, and they give you the recipe so you can make it at home. I recommend the short ribs, plenty of meat that's braised in wine..yumm... and around $40 for the plate; sides are a la carte but, for example, one side of mashed potatoes is more than enough for two people, so if you're trying to keep it economical that's a good thing to remember."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with no expectations.  We have eaten at many places in Vegas. Some good some bad . Most on the strip. But I had never heard much about this place. They blew us away with the best steak that my steak loving husband has had in 66 years on this earth.   I got salmon . The piece was not generous but it melted in my mouth. The seasonings!!!!!   They bring you all these interesting things to taste before your meal . And.....popover rolls .  The Caesar salad was EXCELLENT.  We can't wait to go back.  I wish I would have had room to try a dessert.   Plus..............The coolest salt shakers you will ever see.  The manager even helped me find one on eBay.    Love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We aren't usually fine diners (see other reviews) but once in a while you have to splurge.  I received an offer from Travelzoo and checked with the restaurant to verify which offer to get so that we could apply it to the following:  22 oz USDA prime rib eye steak  2 lb maine lobster  sides of truffle mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mushrooms 2 glasses of wine, one riesling and one cabernet  Included the tastings of foie gras and popovers.  Everything was sublime.  Steak and lobster were both cooked properly and were served in the cast iron pans in which they presumably were cooked.  We were celebrating the Mrs. birthday and they surprised us with prosecco aperitifs on the house.  I'm sure the desserts are fabulous but we couldn't eat another bite after that orgy of decadence so we declined a dessert.  However our waitress did bring us 2 bites of brownie which were indeed something special.   Importantly, the staff seemed knowledgeable about the Travelzoo offer.  They have several offers and they told me which one to buy to ensure we could get the lobster.  Which I did.  Total for the above was about $230 including tax but not tip, and was way more rich food than we could deal with. I ate way more than is sensible, and we could easily have shared with another person or maybe two (although I don't think that would be within the constraints of the offer).  The eligible offer gave me $208 in credit for a pre-paid purchase price of $118 for 2 diners.  Not bad at all.    The room is also really nice, comfortable, and elegant, without being stuffy or unnecessarily high-concept.    In summary, this was an excellent restaurant that I would gladly eat at again without a coupon if I were in the market for a big splurge, which doesn't happen very often.  Or, if you are paying."}
{"text":"Great service and gave free food. They were really accommodating because we had to catch a show and so they expedited our food. The food was great too! Definitely worth going again if you have the funds!"}
{"text":"Good steak- nice atmosphere- decent whisky list- likely the best steak house in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food and service here was great.  We also received complimentary appetizers and desserts, mainly because one of us was a Diamond Rewards Card Holder.  All in all, this is a very generic steak place.  The reason why I gave this a 4 star is because other than the food tasting very good, we had an issue with how one of the steaks was cooked.  Luckily the manager was kind enough to take another person's steak and replace ours with theirs.  The service was fantastic, and got plenty of water.  However, other than the main course and sides, it is not too different from other types of steak places.  I feel this was only rated a little higher, because we got special treatment for having a Diamond Rewards Card Holder."}
{"text":"Menu reads great but the food is overpriced for what shows up to your table. Under seasoned w/no flavor w/the filet mignon and strip steak. Mac n cheese was terrible. Will not be back... patron is watered down"}
{"text":"We've been in several times.  Always a fan.  We usually sit at the bar and have great service.  TV's there are a little wonky on the picture.  Not sure what's up with that.   Steak is always phenomenal.  I usually get the petit filet which they \"cook\" blue, which is my fave.  Had the BBQ Corn which is tasty and the potatoes au gratin are delicious even though I don't really care for potatoes.    Drinks are always well made.  Nice to relax in the Ritz Carlton Lobby Lounge before or after the meal."}
{"text":"We had a company Christmas party there this year and it was amazing. The service was fantastic. My glass was never empty, all 3 of them. The food did take a bit to come out but it was a busy night so I am not going to give them bad marks for that. The food was amazing and we just had an all around great time. Will recommend that location and plan on going back"}
{"text":"This is some of the worst service I've had in quite some time and an overall disappointing experience.  First, my friend had made a reservation and had arrived before me. When I got to the front desk and stated all of this, the 2 girls working \"couldn't find anything\" for about 5 min at which point I gave up and just walked into the restauran to find them on my own.  When I found my friends, they mentioned that they had ordered an appetizer already, but there were no drinks in sight. I was there about 10 min before the server, David, came by to take a drink order...which meant my friends had been waiting even longer for theirs. We ordered 3 wines and an ice tea. We mentioned the long wait for the appetizer and were told the kitchen was busy despite the fact that the restaurant was not full and my friend had ordered tartare. In my opinion, this just wasn't a good answer...just apologize & go check on it.  We got our wines, but the ice tea never came. We ordered salads, a crab cake appetizer, and a 2nd tartare. These took an equally long time and the crab cake was cold. Things were taking SO long that we didn't even bother ordering entrees because we had show tickets and we were afraid we would miss it.  Our server disappeared, and we finally waved down a busser in an attempt to ask for the check. This, of course, also took forever. We split the bill so I didn't get a full total, but a Caesar salad, a crab cake, and a glass of wine came to $52. NOT worth it by a mile!!!"}
{"text":"ate here for the 2nd time ever, both within about a month.  i assumed it would be good, but both times was legitimately impressed by the diversity of the offerings, and the magical combination of comfort & refinement.  maple bacon with chimi churri is insane.  crispy red snapper with chorizo broth is delish.  the duck liver mousse with port jelly on top is really outstanding, goes great on the popovers.  i seem to always get whiskey here, there is a wide selection, but next time i'll have to dive into the wine list.  by all appearances it is on par with the rest of excellence.  honestly, HIDDEN GEM at Ballys, better than probably 70% of the 'steak' places in town, but probably 20% less expensive."}
{"text":"Ate here last time in Vegas, always looking for new places to visit while in town.  This is a definite, even though it is located in Bally's.  Service was excellent and the food was awesome.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent meal every time I am in Las Vegas  Service is attentive  Food is tasty and fresh  Extras are a plus  One of my favorite  place to dine in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Bistro (Chef) Laurent Tourondel - BLT  Parking:  Dec 2017, it is free for the first hour.  4 hours to 24 hours is $10.  Check-In:  Welcomed by a friendly smile and check in was a breeze with my reservation.  Seating:  We were seated underneath the \"blackboard\" displayed today's special.  The sofa is not good for shorty (under 6ft).  I have to elevate myself in order to cut into my steak.  Note to self:  No sofa seating.  Another couple was seated next to us.  Immediately, the lady asked to switch seat with her tall husband.  Service:  Professional and knowledgeable  Food: -Appetizer:  Tuna Tartare surprised me with its flavor at a Morden American Steakhouse.  I'd order it again.  I also order crab cake but my waitress did not hear my order.  So, we bypassed it. -Comps:  Pâté is a good start with couple slices of crunchy bread. The popover is warm on arrival.  One pop per person  It was a good bake.  Sea salt and butter is it's company. -Entrees: NY Strip 16oz (Medium is Pink, Hot Center) is perfect for my normal medium rare but it is referred as the medium here. Bone-In Ribeye 22oz (Medium Rare is Red, Warm Center) Refer to the Steak Temp on the left-hand side of the menu.  It ranges from Blue (very red, cold center) to Well Done (no pink, hot center). Sides: Onion Rings is not the kind I liked.  It is not crispy on the outside and the onion is not very sweet.  But, the onion is fresh and crunchy on the inside.  I will pass this side next time. Truffle Mashed (Potato) is heavenly smooth and infused with truffle. Dessert:  Sundaes.  I am not a sundaes person but I wanted to try something different.  Again, it surprised me.  The sundaes come in a classic tall glass with a long spoon.  The ice cream quality is high and flavors are well paired with each other.  Each bite comes with a little surprise like a piece of chocolate, or a yummy crunchy piece of candy.  If all sundaes are like this one, I will be in love with sundaes all over again.  This is a quality restaurant inside Bally's.  Tips: -Since parking is no longer free, I planned my day at and around Bally's.  We visited the Bodies exhibit at Bally's on the lower level.  Then, We walked across the bridge to Bellagio to see the water fountain, seasonal display.  By this time, it is about time for my dinner reservation here.  After dinner, we walked to Paris for a little more site seeing.  Instead of walking back to where we came from, we exit the Paris hotel & casino and walked on the strip and back into Bally's garage. -I asked if I can take the menu home with me because I like the Angus Beef Chart reference on the back of the menu.  The waitress gladly gave me one to keep."}
{"text":"The stakes were pretty good but I can't imagine spending that much money on dinner and drinking tap water."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! Had a travelzoo voucher was way too much food but was fun to order whatever we wanted. Keep in mind you still have to pay tax and tip.   Popovers A+ Liver pate B+ Tuna tartar A+ burrata B Lobster Salad B+ Ribeye B outside was too burnt for me at Medium rare Chimichuri sauce F way to spicy not edible Do not get this never tasted chimmichuri like this Banana Cream pie A Complimentary desserts A Drinks B"}
{"text":"SO AMAZING!! My darling and I did the Travelzoo deal for 2, which ends up being a credit towards whatever you'd like to order. You're not set to a strict choice, and they make it easy to use.  Our meal started with a complimentary duck confit and the \"famous\" popovers (which met the hype for sure!). We ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer.. which were 4 huge meaty shrimp with lemon and sauce- so fresh and so good! We also split a Caesar salad which had a nice dressing we enjoyed. Our main meal choices were the 10oz filet mignon and the rack of lamb, which were absolutely mouth watering!! The lamb was the winner here though!! We also enjoyed mac and cheese, along with the stuffed mushrooms as our side dishes-both were devoured!! Last but not least we shared a peanut butter chocolate mousse- it was rich! Needless to say we were completely stuffed and definitely got our money's worth!! Our service was also amazing, our server was very informative, helpful, and so nice! The people seated next to us were extremely rude, and I felt the staff handled their \"situation\" so well without disturbing our experience.  We loved it and would hope to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The stuff is so kind and the selection of food is great.  The bread was amazing and the meat, Branzino was excellent and very recommended."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation through OpenTable.   Once I arrived we were greeted and waited about 5 minutes. The host was very friendly, sat us, and told us we had the best waitress on the BLT staff.   Service was amazing, from the waitress to the bus team to the servers.   The bread pop overs the table received prior to our order were wonderful and so tasty I'd recommend this place just so you can experience them.   My wife ordered the wedge salad and I had had the butternut squash soup. The wedge salad was perfect, served on a cold place as a salad should be. My soup looked good but tasted a bit sweeter than I prefer. I didn't say a word about it as it wasn't a bad soup, it was done they way he chef intended for it to be done but it wasn't they type I cared for. The service team saw I didn't eat any and asked if all was ok and I said I didn't care for it so they removed it from the bill. (Very thoughtful to proactively ask and take action when a patron isn't even making an issue)  We were a party of 4 and had salmon, filet, and ribeyes for dinner. Our food was properly cooked and tasted amazing. The table consensus was that the bone in ribeye was the best but once again all our entres were wonderful.   For dessert we ordered ice cream, apple cobbler and the table was also given brownie and candy pops. All of which were the perfect way to end our best dinner of a 5 day stay in Vegas.  Based on this experience (12/30) I have already booked another visit for Valentine's Day!  See you soon BLT!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best steakhouse ive ever eaten at!my wife and i were alittle worried being its located in one of the older hotels(ballys)but we decieded to go any way.As with all steakhouses it was a bit pricey but the food was second to none!we shared a 36oz porterhouse between us with two sides and it was done to perfection!the service was good and the popovers were even better i would recommend this to everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Our expectations were really high since we love Chef Gordon Ramsey so much but we were hugely disappointed. We ordered the scallops that were great but the rib eye was a huge bummer! I understand a sear but when my steak comes out black, I call that burned. Our waiter was distracted with a table that came in after us that apparently was VIP. This table sent their food back which seemed to overwhelm him due to his eye rolling. He finally came back to us and gave us a lesson on searing in a 1700 degree oven and that's how it's supposed to be. Well, we were not happy and it tasted like charcoal that lasted in our mouths for hours. A manager was offered to us and the same lesson on searing in a 1700 degree oven was provided. I was about to go crazy. She did tell us to make up for it we MIGHT be able to get a cocktail or a dessert to share. The thing is we didn't get either. We waited about 45 minutes for our waiter to stop attending to the VIP table, who seemed just as unhappy, and come back to us. Let's just say by this time I wanted to be Gordon and call someone a \"bloody donkey\"! I will still watch and enjoy Hell's Kitchen and understand why he's looking for a new chef! Love Chef Ramsey still with all my heart but do not recommend this place. Had better food and service at Salt Grass Steak House!"}
{"text":"I was out here in mid-December for my birthday with a bunch of friends, one of which found this place.  While we did use a groupon, we were also drinking and very friendly, as was our server, so the few reviews that mentioned this to be an issue, I think may be outliers.  Sides were great, service was top notch, steak was cooked to my specifications and had a really fantastic taste.  The server, bus team, and hostess were all great, now, I realize that 2 weeks before Christmas is off season, but I'm not in anyway going to hold that as the only reason they were great to us...I think it was because they're really good at their jobs, and, well, I'm fun, LOL.  Still not sure if the happy birthday plate was my brother or he just gave them a heads up and did this.  Either way, I had a great time, and ate some great food with some great family and friends."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with a party of 6.  The restaurant was not busy at all, however, we waited for 30 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we were waited on promptly.  After placing our order, they never came back to refill our water glasses or see if we wanted anything else. We ate our dinner with no beverage.  The food itself was delicious.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the appetizers were great.  We were disappointed with the service.  4 guys standing around monitoring service but not one of them pitching in to ask us if we needed anything."}
{"text":"I'll tell you about my meal first, and add some additional context towards the end.  I dined at \"BLT\", located within Bally's, on the Las Vegas Strip, Labor Day weekend 2017. I ordered the Caesar Salad ($16.00), New York Steak ($58.00) and a Baked Potato ($12.00). For their complimentary bread service, I was provided a popover. (The restaurant's complete menu, with pricing, is available on their website.)  I am not a fan of \"Yorkshire Pudding\", but I now understand that a \"popover\" technically is a different product. (Yorkshire pudding incorporates beef drippings in the recipe, whereas popovers do not.) I found the popover to be very tasty, without the feature of pudding I dislike.   I can't say that the Caesar salad tasted any better than one you might order at lower priced restaurant. But the texture was different:  the leaves were more tender. Upon inspection of the lettuce leaves, I suspect they are using baby Romaine lettuce (versus fully grown Romaine).  I also enjoyed the presentation. (Hopefully, my photo attaches.) It was a nice salad.  I usually don't buy New York steaks at the grocery. I find the cut tougher than I prefer. However, the menu stated that BLT's New York steak was aged 28 days--and the aging really makes a difference. Because of the aging, the beef was tender, but firm enough for you to enjoy the sensation of chewing. The aging process also infused the meat with just a hint of gaminess. I asked that the steak be cooked medium rare, and what I received was \"perfect\" in my eyes:  it was seared on the outside; the interior of the steak was hotter than warm, yet the color was still red; and the juices ran clear. A pat of herb butter was placed atop the steak as well. Overall, the steak was rich, savory and flavorful.  The baked potato is not the largest potato that I have been served in a la carte setting; however, it could sufficiently serve two people.  My original plan was to dine at a steak restaurant within the Paris resort, before attending a show. However, there was a wait--which surprised me, given the time of day I visited. Not wanting to be late for my show, I went to BLT (where I found there was no wait).   So here's my bottom line:  BLT is not inexpensive. However, you will get a very good steak dinner, at a price less expensive than a restaurant affiliated with a marquee chef. And seating may be faster. Please don't misinterpret what I'm saying:  Sometimes you want the experience of eating at a restaurant tied to a celebrity chef; sometimes you just want the meal. My meal at BLT was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here and it was the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! I wish there was a BLT Steak in Denver, because it would be my go-to place for special occasions. I've been to all the top steak houses around: Ruth's Chris, Cap Grill, Morton's, Del Friscos, etc. and BLT Steak tops them all! We started with salads: the caesar and the spinach with warm bacon dressing; both were amazing and we couldn't decide which was better. The martinis we sipped on had the most rockstar buttery blue cheese stuffed olives in them. The New York strip was cooked perfectly and melted in  my mouth! The side we chose was Mac and cheese, which was gooey, rich, and absolutely heavenly! The stuffed mushrooms side dish was ok, a little dry and too earthy tasting in my opinion. I also want to give big props to the waitstaff, especially our waiter Sergio. He's been with the restaurant for decades and was spot-on with menu recommendations, as well as entertaining with his stories about favorite past celebrity guests and interesting Bally's history. Thanks again for a fabulous meal; in the future we'll always make BLT Steak a part of our Vegas visits!!"}
{"text":"Consistently my favorite steakhouse in Vegas.  I would recommend making reservations a couple days in advance especially for peak dining times.  If you have a total rewards card they do accept it here.  The ambiance is classy without being pretentious and boasts an intimate/romantic vibe.  We arrived early and enjoyed a few glasses of wine from the bar in the waiting area.  Our server was Mario and I can't say enough good things about him but, he is definitely the best server I have had anywhere in the past 6 months.  For me the portion size of the filet with a few sides was enough for my friend and I to split, especially after the popovers they bring to the table.  They have an extensive wine list with a selection for every dish.  Popovers:  Served with butter and sea salt.  Be careful these are dangerously good and you will fill up fast.  This time they gave us a little recipe card with them so I will definitely try to recreate them at home.  Duck Liver Pate:  This came out compliments of the chef.  I am normally not a fan since it's usually so gamy but, it wasn't here.  It was smooth, creamy and mild in flavor.   Ceaser Salad:  The salad was good but, I felt the dressing lacked the bold and robust flavor that it had on previous visits.  Filet: Juicy, flavorful, tender and cooked to the exact temperature we requested.  The pad of butter on top really gives it that something extra and I always order the blue cheese sauce on the side because it's a must have.  Veal Chop:  I am not a fan of veal however, I took the opportunity to take a bite of my friends.  It was a perfect medium, juicy and very lean.  If I wasn't such a steak fan I would probably order this next time.  Sides:  Mashed Potatoes: So creamy and bordering on the edge of runny but, flavorful. Stuffed Mushroom Caps: Hearty flavored filling and the mushroom caps were done without being mushy.  Hen of the Woods Mushrooms: A perfect accompaniment to the flavor of the steak and a large portion size.   Dessert: We chose the almond joy dessert off of the daily specials list and we were not disappointed with the artistry, creativity or flavors.  Mario also brought out a small brownie bite for all of us and even though I liked the almond joy better they were moist and well executed.  You can go elsewhere and pay a lot more for lackluster service and overpriced steaks on the strip that don't taste as good as this place but, I prefer consistency in every way."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse. Food was perfect. Unique popovers. Excellent wine. Incredible service. Caesar salad was big and delicious"}
{"text":"Nestled in the lobby of the Ritz, BLT is very visually appealing, and the staff is very welcoming as well.  Even the food gets in on the act, with the menu items both sounding good and looking good, from the bread and pate served up as you arrive to the fluffy cheese rolls - no ultra-salty Red Lobster biscuits here (not that there are any things wrong with those!).  When it comes to the actual menu, the hits just keep coming, and even dishes like tuna tartare (yes, in a place named after steak!) work with the flavors mildly fusing together.   If there is any downfall it is that the service tends to slide from where it starts, so that glasses go unfilled for a while and generally things can take a touch longer than they should. It isn't horrible, and just as you start wondering, they will show up and make you feel better, but an extra step could do wonders here."}
{"text":"Hosted a group dinner for 7 last week and was very impressed with the food overall. We had Oysters, Crab cakes and Grilled bacon for appetizers. Only the Crab cakes left something to be desired (too much cake, not enough crab for $16). The highlight of BLT though is the steaks. Our group had Fillets and bone in Ribeye and everyone said it was one of the better, if not best steaks they could remember having. The side items are all A la carte, with the Mac n Cheese and Brussels sprouts being the best. Not huge portions, but enough for everyone to get a forkful. Booze pricing was good for Vegas = $8 Beers & $12 Call brand with a healthy shot. Service was attentive and while the overall atmosphere wasn't anything spectacular, the Steaks made up for it."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place was definitely the service! From the girls up front to our waiter, just fantastic customer service. Everyone was super friendly, informative and greeted us with smiles.   Our waiter, Duff, was an absolute pro. He knew that menu inside and out. He was able to give us great recommendations on the wine list and food menu. He made everything sound so delicious that we wanted to order the whole menu! Just a phenomenal job.   Now for the food... They started us off with a little amuse Bouche. It was duck liver mousse with jelly. I don't like liver at all but I gave it a try and wow it was good. My favorite thing was the popovers they brought instead of your typical loaf of bread. The flavor and texture were great and they even give you a card with the recipe! Sharing is caring!   My fiancé got the Caesar salad which was great. He got the NY strip steak which was huge and I got my go to Filet Mignon. The steak was good but not the best I've had. Good flavor but it was only warm not piping hot even though it was served on a cast iron plate. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. It paired nicely with their plump asparagus and delicious Mac & cheese. I guess I was a little disappointed in the steak, but everything else was great. Perhaps I'm a steak snob but when you've had some delicious steak you're always chasing the next best thing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meal and the service. This place is very pricey so be prepared to pay a steep bill. The waiter was very helpful, with explaining the menu. It is always important when the atmosphere is just right."}
{"text":"SHIT trifecta:  horrible service, marginal food, expensive."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, good ambiance. We had crab cakes appetizer. My mom had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes, my dad had the lamb with green beans, my brother had the ribeye with corn and I had the bone-in New York strip with corn as well. The appetizer and entrees are  excellent. I'd recommend the side of corn which is baked with cream and lobster sauce. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I asked what she was hungry for, and she wanted stuffed mushrooms.  A quick search on Yelp turned up this establishment, reviews were good, restaurant was within view from the hotel, so...  BLT Steak is located in the Bally Casino. Apparently the acronym BLT is for Bistro Laurent Tourondel.  Laurent Tourondel being the Executive Chef/ owner of BLT with multiple locations in the US and around the world.  We sat at the bar, in some very comfortable chairs.  Very comfortable!  After our drinks were served, complimentary fresh baked popovers w/Gruyere cheese were brought out. Just two words, unique and excellent! A bit of butter, a little wine ... could have called it a meal at that point.  Stuffed mushroom cap appetizer was next, and packed with flavor.  Maybe a tad overcooked, but to be fair, the reduction in moisture actually intensified the flavor. Not a huge deal as all four of the caps were eaten; I'll take credit for three of them!  Bone in New York Strip was brought out medium rare as requested. The steak had excellent flavor, with a wonderful char on it. But, I don't think I'm being too picky to say, a $61 steak should be way more tender, shouldn't be chewy!  Service at the bar was excellent, with three different people making our experience a very good one.  We split the steak and mushroom side, and along with four drinks, a $150 bill was dropped. Not something you do every day, so overall, it was worth it.  Kinda goes without saying, but there are endless restaurants to eat at in Vegas, but we both agreed the atmosphere, food and service would definitely cause us to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The popovers they bring you or some of the best table bread I've ever had any restaurant. I had two cocktails that were both great. My wife enjoyed her wedge salad and I enjoyed the spinach salad. Brussel sprout side was great. The only weak point was the stuffed mushrooms, I would avoid those. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly as we ordered them. You can't ask for a lot more out of a steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for pre dinner cocktails, and every time they are great! This place by far has the best mojitos. Couldn't even get a picture of the full drinks because we sucked them down so fast!"}
{"text":"The place is great. Went here for the first time and I was not disappointed. Everything the waiter recommended was great. This place really knows how to make a steak. Porterhouse is their house special and man it is special. If you in Vegas and want a good steak. Go here. Period."}
{"text":"This place was exceptional. I am knocking it down a star because it seemed that every wine we ordered was out f stock. Kind of a random occurrence because they had a really extensive list that could cater to anyone's taste. I do have to say that the General Manager apologized profusely each time he said they were out of a particular wine, but he did suggest another wine which was actually a great pairing to what we ordered and suited both of our tastes. Kudos for him for knowing his stuff! Also knocking down a star because once we were seated it took 10-15 minutes for our server to come over. Once he introduced himself, he was very helpful and friendly.   The amuse bouche was a pate... I don't remember what kind, but have you ever seen someone who doesn't eat meat break out a little redneck and try to lick the bowl clean? It was incredible. Wow. I want to get in the bowl of that deliciousness.   We had the tuna tartare for our appetizer. I always order this fan favorite if I see it on the menu and I was not disappointed in their take on this dish. Try this if you like tuna!  My other half had the NY Strip and ordered it medium rare. This restaurant nails it on the head for cooking their steaks perfectly! Although he claims that he wishes he ordered it rare instead, it was thoroughly enjoyed. I had a bite and found it a tad too salty, but what can you expect from an aged steak? And in my opinion he should have ordered the steak rare (or blue, yes they do that here yay!), it is his own dang fault.  I had the Grilled Branzino. Having never tried this before, I was intimidated. I don't know why. This meal completely surpassed my expectations. It was incredible. I was finished with my fish before he could finish his steak!  On the side we ordered the mac-n-cheese. Overall it was good, but I have to say it wasn't mixed well so a few bites were extremely salty. The truffle mashed potatoes were everything I hoped and dreamed. I would order both again and just make sure to stir thoroughly next time.  I don't know that I would return as there are so many other steak house options, but I would recommend."}
{"text":"I came in with a party 12 without reservations and had no problem getting a table. We received excellent service and food. We had popovers, which were amazing and they gave you the recipe. We also tried the tuna tartare, shrimp cocktail, and mussels. I had the bone-in ribeye, one of the best steaks I've had. I added the turf option of crab, but it was very salty and dry. It's a great go-to for steak."}
{"text":"I had the steak with the bone marrow.  It was delicious.  Service was quick and my steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for a simple date. We dressed up and did not know what to expect. A gentleman named Omar served us that evening and in spite of us having a good time, we tried to budget accordingly. Even a such, Omar was continually professional and surprised us with good food and samples at every turn. Please ask for him and his services. Simply wonderful."}
{"text":"We went here for a Anv. Dinner. We put aside 1 1/2hour for dinner before we go to are show that night. It took the waiter 10 min to just bring are menu to us. Once we did order we waited an hour for just are main course. We ordered the porter house for 2. The strip was very hard to cut. It was not easy to cut or chew. The filet was good. It was nice the girls from Hells Kitchen winner came out to try to cut the time we are waiting to eat.  If you go here make sure you give your self 2 hours to eat. The service is very slow here. Don't get the porter house for 2. The truffle potatoes are great."}
{"text":"I had visited BLT on Sunday during the Sterling Brunch, however this was the first time going during the evening. It definitely will not be the last. The entire BLT experience was excellent. The ambience let's you know that you are in for a great meal and dining experience. The waiter was spot on very friendly and knowledgeable. He made sure that we were there not just a meal but an experience.  The food was delightful. From the bread poppers which are just heavenly, they even include the recipe in case you want to make them at home.  I ordered the filet, while my wife ordered the ribeye. Both were cooked exactly as we requested and were excellent. My wife had ordered potato skins, which I admit seemed odd to be on the menu. However, once they arrived, I saw that they weren't any ordinary potato skins. They were top notch right along with everything else on the menu.  The glazed carrots were excellent as well. To finish off the evening, we had the carrot cake and the strawberry sundae. Both desserts were excellent and a fitting way to end the evening.  BLT is a must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"A secret gem hidden in the back of Ballys.....one of our favorite places to eat. The service is always exceptional (thanks to Leslie tonight)and the food is delicious....from the homemade pop overs to the banana pie made in house also...everything is awesome.One bone in rib eye to share is all a couple needs...we always take home food for the next day too.Don't miss this place....and if you have a total rewards Diamond card they give you extras also"}
{"text":"Terrible and sketchy would be the 2 words to describe this place went in with large group and from the moment we walked in they couldn't push their $100 appetizer and $100 bottles of wine fast enough!! Waiter took it upon himself to order enough for group of 21 and filled the tables with them 2-3 on each and then blamed the chef that he made to many!!! Made them take most of them off bill and of course they recommend a bottle of wine to another part of my party that just happens to be $125 for bottle??? I asked party members if they knew and they had no idea cost? Waiter than goes on to recommend their $90 a piece steaks to guests keep in mind waiters tip is guaranteed due to size of party!!! Once agIn complained to manager and he was as useless As the waiter!! Will be speaking to ownership over this!! Food was ok at best \"famous\" popovers were burnt and gross!! Took forever for food and service was awful!!! Avoid at all costs!! Go to Gordon Ramsey steak house or the 9nine in palms or joes steakhouse!! If I could give it 0 stars I would!!! The only reason I didn't walk out with all 23 guests was they were customers of mine who were staying at ballys so I could not ruin their dinner over this but if it was family or friends we would have walked out!!! Do not eat here, oh did I mentioned I had called for reservations and when I got there they had my name down but no party size!!!   Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had! Complementary pate, pop-overs, and brownies. The porterhouse was cooked to perfection. The flavor was fantastic, and I barely had to use my knife. The waiter was timely, and he was absolutely hilarious! One of the nicest guys I've ever met. This was about a month ago so I can't quite remember his name, but he had a mustache. Overall, it was a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing service Awesome food Went for bday dinner Was a little upset/surprised no dress code Some dressed ....others t shirt .. Sometimes it nice to dress up for 65.00 steak  Will be back"}
{"text":"Highlight Experience: Everything I ate was scrumptious.  Food: Excellent Service: Excellent, on par with Gary Danko Ambience: Typical posh steakhouse Price: Expensive, but reasonable for fancy ingredients  What to wear: Tasteful attire, suits and dresses Would I return: Yes, but only with a coupon"}
{"text":"Overall I had a good experience. I must say the hostess was a bit rude but other than that the service was nice. The food was delicious. I had a wonderful fine dining experience and will go back despite the rude hostess."}
{"text":"My wife and I returned here to celebrate her birthday, and we again enjoyed the things we loved last time. We were treated to a duck liver pate, which my wife again said she wouldn't like, and again she loved. We also loved the salad and again ate every scrap of the popovers. I can't recall the last time I wanted every bit of an early course.  For the main course, we shared an insanely good 12 ounce Wagyu ribeye. When. you eat the fat and it dissolves into the best gravy you've ever had, then you know it was $92 well-spent. The stuffed mushroom caps were excellent, but the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were the perfect pairing with a perfect cut of meat.   The onion rings were disappointingly doughy and under seasoned. They happily took it off the bill, however, so no harm done.  There's a lot of great steak to be had in Las Vegas, but you won't find a better piece of beef than you will here."}
{"text":"The best meal I have ever had! The popovers were too die for! Delicious salads, mouth watering steak, and yummy truffle potatoes. Excellent service. This restaurant is a must eat while you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service was spot on. They kept the glasses filled and the food was pouring in. Our waiter, Javier, was so personable and on top of his game. Food was really good and exceeded our expectations. Only complaint is the lighting was too bright and truffle mash potatoes needed some texture, they were too runny. Would def go back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The bread is delicious, and the ambience is decent. I ended up getting a bone in ribeye and it was 9/10. Very soft and tender, but it's not the BEST BEST there is. Also the waiters could be a little less creepy, but aside from that it was a fairly good place to eat. The only drawback is that the restroom is outside and the wait can get pretty long even after you ordered. I'll still come back."}
{"text":"We made a huge mistake and over ordered.  This restaurant is everything I expected and more.  The service was friendly and informative.  Just a warning do not over order.  Plan your meal as to what is most important to you.  If you like dessert skip sides or apps etc.  We are big eaters and could not finish all the food or order dessert.  Next time we will be prepared."}
{"text":"Their complimentary liver moose and popover were so great! Me and my boyfriend ordered lobster bisque that were so satisfying, we also had the truffle mashed and the grilled asparagus for appetizers and they were great. As for the steaks, I had the ribeye and my boyfriend had the ny strip, and both were really really good."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Surprising! The rolls are unbelievably, my husband had shrimp cocktail and he kept commenting on how unique the cocktail sauce was and the shrimp were jumbo, I ordered the salad wedge for my appetizer.  For dinner I had Filet mignon, my husband had the bone-in sirloin both were perfect. Tony was a great waiter and his helper, I wish I had got his name, he was such a hard worker I gave him a separate tip, which I hope he got to keep because he deserved it. The only other restaurant that comes close is the Orchid at the Palms in Cincinnati."}
{"text":"Meat Candy  Steak is great, sides are ok"}
{"text":"OMG!  The absolute best steak I have ever had!  Everything was great from the before-dinner drinks to the appetizers to the sides to the STEAK!  Table-side service by Leslie was great!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"All of our sides were great the asparagus  and  potato  sounds were everything! Out server was great.  The service was sloooow. We hit there at 8:15 left at 10:35 just to slow.  Orderd well done t bone was bloody.  Not even a tolerable  amount of pink it was red.  Had to send back and the chicken was not done had to send back. For the prices I don't exciter to have to send back food.  Overall  nice experience. I'm not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"Wait time, service and Steak was perfect. Recommend that you buy the coupon for $3 to get 30% off prior to going."}
{"text":"Another great night at one of the Strip's best steakhouses. The food and the service is always top-notch. Their crab legs are always a good alternative to steak, and you can never go wrong with the bone-in rib eye. Tried the Brussels sprouts for the first time and was pleasantly surprised (can't go wrong when you add bacon/pancetta yumminess to the mix). Must-have item is the banana cream pie. The. Best. Ever. Our server David went above and beyond, but I've never had anything less than stellar service here. Looking forward to our next visit already!"}
{"text":"Great steaks with awesome flavor! Came here for dinner and had ordered a chopped veggie salad with the filet. I wish that they brought out the salad with the steak, but no complaints they where both great. Not cheap, but the quality is what you pay for. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant for steak. Great ambience service is impeccable. They have prime grass fed beef and also wagu. The bacon appetizer is one of my all-time favorite apps. Also if you are a diamond or seven star on Caesar's properties they do something special for you. Going to be one of my regular places to eat."}
{"text":"Had a group dinner party here in their private room.  Superb ambiance and top class service.  The popovers are practically a meal in it of itself.  Shrimp Cocktail and the smoked bacon appetizer are a must have.  Caesar salad with garlic croutons are excellent.  As for the entree, the 28 day aged NY Strip was melt in your mouth...   As for staff, from the minute we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess and our server Juan and Manager KC made this event such a success.  Juan was a humorous and \"game on\" server and KC was able to demonstrate excellent management as she was able to oversee and make sure we were accommodated...   When in Vegas I will return ..."}
{"text":"Made Reservations using Open Table about 3 weeks before our Las Vegas trip. We watch Hell's Kitchen so was excited to eat at BLT Steak and it did not disappoint. Our table had .. Roasted Beet Salad, Lobster Cobb Salad, Caesar Salad, bacon wrapped dates, Porterhouse steak, Filet Mignon, Chilean Sea bass with sides Truffle Mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushroom caps, creamed spinach, and baked potato. The steaks and fish were cooked perfectly. Even my Dad, the toughest food critic enjoyed every last bite of his meal. And my mom could not stop talking about the gruyère cheese popovers!  Service was excellent! We will definitely be returning.   For those complaining about prices and sides being separate well this is very common for high end steak houses. Mastros, Ruth Chris, Lawry's etc are all comparably priced and sides are all separate."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday with two old friends visiting from the midwest and it was excellent. Servers were very attentive throughout making sure we had everything we needed and offered suggestions that always hit the mark. Started with a duck liver pate thing and it was phenomenal. As you will probably read over an over again in other reviews the popovers are easily one of my favorite uses of bread ever, they are light and rich and have great eggy goodness perfectly complemented with the sweet cream and sea salt. My buddies had the special steak with truffle butter and I had the bone-in Ribeye. All three steaks were perfectly cooked and had incredible flavor. On a whim I ordered the blue cheese sauce on the side because it sounded good, but the steak was so tasty I didn't really use it. It seemed like a waste to cover up that great steak flavor with a sauce that wasn't necessary. Overall an excellent meal and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Being in town for business I found this lovely joint and couldn't not have enjoyed it more. It was not just the fantastic dining. It was also the impeccable professionalism by the staff but mostly how Lenga Sampson handled a situation that could have escalated by individuals who take advantage. Great food fantastic management! A+++!"}
{"text":"The total experience from check in to, meeting our server and getting our meal was fantastic.  The popovers are wonderful, and we can vouch for the lobster and the ribeye..both amazing. We had peanut butter mouse for dessert, was just to die for.  The best part was that we got to meet executive chef Ariel Malone. She is amazing and so down to earth! Thanks for the amazing dinner Ariel!"}
{"text":"Food:  The cut of meats were great.   Had a ribeye and rack of lamb.  It was cooked to order but I found the seasoning lacking for a $60+ steak.    Service:  The service was friendly but slow.   It looks like the server had too many tables.   I am guessing someone called in sick.   Overall:  If you are going to spend $150+ on dinner then this food may not live up to your expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday night at 8ish. The Jazz band in the lobby bar area was KILLER! We were immediately seated and experienced their complimentary appetizer, their fancy bread, steak, crab cakes, burger, dessert, and an alcoholic latte. I am being somewhat vague because I really want whoever reads this to simply choose to eat whatever they are in the mood for that night. It will be amazing whatever you select. The ambiance was very modern and posh. Dimly lit and plenty of servers hooking up the water glass refills the entire time. The only thing I will say is for $8 up your beer choice to something crafty instead of Coors Light/ Miller Lite.  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"My husband treated us to BLT Steak for our 3-year wedding anniversary, and this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  We were seated in a quiet corner booth, with plush seating and pillows. The table was nicely decorated with a small rock/water/plant vase and a single candle. Super romantic and elegant. We had the best server... King Kujo (excuse the spelling??), who we have had before and again, he didn't disappoint at all. He was super attentive, and sweet, and funny. He added to the perfect atmosphere!  The restaurant starts you out with chicken liver pate and bread, which I tried (my husband wasn't too daring), but quickly dismissed. I'm sure it's excellent if you like this! They also bring you their popovers, which are huge, hollow muffins with gruyere cheese, served with REAL butter and sea salt. Oh. My. God. These are worth the trip alone! I tried their raspberry mule as my before dinner drink, which was so refreshing. I ordered off the Blackboard Menu, which is essentially a 3-course dinner, so I started with the mushroom risotto. I love risotto and am very picky about it, and this was so creamy and flavorful; my new favorite in town! My husband order the rib-eye and I order the NY strip, both medium-rare. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt and pepper. The melted garlic butter on top makes the steak go from A to A+. For dessert, Kujo brought us out their red-velvet cake with vanilla ice cream, which was to die for. I'm not a huge red-velvet fan, but this was so moist and fluffy and yummy, I almost ate the entire slice.   Since it was our anniversary, they discounted our check and comped the dessert as a thank you for celebrating with BLT Steak. So sweet! And be prepared to have a staff with impeccable customer service: never an empty plate left on the table, wiping the crumbs after every course, and folding your napkin when you go to the restroom. Dinner took roughly 2  1/2 hours, and it was nice to sit and eat a delicious, formal meal, and not be rushed thru it. The final verdict: A++  Pros: Everything! Of course the steak is the best in town, and the red-velvet cake is a MUST!  Cons: Our booth didn't come with a blanket to nap after all of that food! Haha!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time since watching all the hype from Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out very rare. It was blood red in the center in still cold. No wonder there currently looking for a new headed chef there.   I also had grill Lobster which looked beautiful but was a rubbery mess. The cream sauce was a nice and delicate but was negated by the overcooked lobster. I should her to think if Gordon Ramsay where they're he would have sent it back to the kitchen, before it made its way to me.  On a side note, the hen of the woods mushrooms were lovely and i would come back for the popovers. As Gordon Ramsey would say: \"What a shame.\""}
{"text":"Excellent steaks along the lines of the famous Manhattan and Chicago steakhouses.  Tender like butter and just as juicy.  I had the 15 ounce ribeye cooked medium.  Appetizers were creative and tasty.  I had the tuna and some half-shell oysters from Cali - very nice.  Apps were served with a tasty, fascinating bread that looked to be cooked in a small flowerpot and had a light, airy, pastry consistency inside the crisp outer crust. Finished with the Peanut Butter Mousse which was definitely worth the decadence."}
{"text":"I had the Ribeye and it was pretty good. Popovers were awesome. I also liked the atmosphere there. Sat at the bar, the service was a bit slow and bartender had his head down so couple people including myself had a hard time requesting things or getting the check for an extended period, otherwise, great!"}
{"text":"Service and decor and location were nice I have nothing to say about those however this review will be purely on the food.   Ribeye steak around $55.    Very very salty. Unevenly cooked (ranging from perfect to tough/dry)  I love steak. I love ribeye. This was very disappointing.   Overall I would say no to a good steakhouse experience at this establishment. Next time at Vegas we will be trying something else"}
{"text":"I really don't want to leave a review for BLT because I love this place so much! I want to keep this as my pocket list for steakhouses in Vegas but I want this place to do good so it doesn't close down!   The food are reasonably priced and you get a discount if you have total rewards card!  You can also go to dinner4tonight booth for discounts off your meal.    On to the food- Popovers are to die for but don't stuff yourself with this! Save room for entrees! The chicken pate is super delish. Goes great with popover of you are not butter & sea salt type of person (I love their butterrrrrr!) Bone in ribeye is very flavorful and comes with bone marrow and roasted garlic in cast iron pans. Love their filet mignon too! Must try if you are a filet lover! Oh wait, don't forget the charcuterie plate and the fresh oysters as starters.  Overall, the price, the food & the service are great and this place has become my new favorite steakhouse!"}
{"text":"(Bar review only)  I went last night (Saturday) during happy hour. They had some decent seating left so I had to check it out. I had a great bartender name Robert tending to me and he made me three awesome drinks.  I started off with the mule then  The blt cocktail: bulliet bourbon, lillet blanc,  house ginger syrup,  lemon juice, orange bitters, topped w/ elderflower tonic  And then Robert recommended the old cuban: appleton v/x rum, lime juice,  brown sugar syrup, angostura bitters, mint leaves,  topped w/ champagne  For 7 dollars a drink you couldn't beat the value and service! Thanks I will see you guys again soon!!"}
{"text":"If you want to be spoiled..dine at BLT Steak @ Bally's Las Vegas. It was amazing and ask for Javier he will take care of you. dinner was amazing. I have to say besides the  veal chop and the Mac and cheese, the best thing that was served was the complementary duck patè with sliced salami on the side..FANTASTIC. After the meal was finished, our server then surprised us with 2 cake pops and 2 bite size brownies. if your looking for a great steak house in Vegas..I highly recommend BLT Steak at Bally's hotel."}
{"text":"I did not have a steak here, due to the extraordinarily exorbitant price of $60 for one steak. but I ate a couple bites from the steak of those who did order it, and it was good. $60 good? I personally cannot justify it. I did have an excellent baked potato - thank you Yelpers for that recommendation. It was beautifully presented, beautiful setting, extremely professional service. 4 stars for all that. I'll stick with my $12 buffet thank you (see my other review)."}
{"text":"High-End Steakhouse at Bally's?!?  Who Woulda thought?! Bought a Groupon for this restaurant and sooooo glad I did!! (I was informed that they are a newer restaurant on the strip and using Groupon to get more business & reviews). There were multiple other choices but my fiancé and I hadn't tried this restaurant yet so we thought we'd give it a go. Food was excellent, service was excellent and they even did a special champagne toast as soon as we told the wait staff we were celebrating our recent engagement. We ordered the Porterhouse for two, split a Caesar salad & mashed potatoes and it was plenty of food and we even had leftovers. Definitely a hidden Gem!! We made made reservations , but it was a Monday night and it wasn't that busy and we didn't really need them. P.S. the fresh baked popovers are ridiculously amazing!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3 1/2 stars, I would. We bought a travelzoo voucher, good deal. I really liked that they didn't stick to the 'rules' and let us spend the whole $178 the way we wanted to instead of 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 side and 1 dessert. I had the 10 oz Filet Mignon and my Husband had the bone in Rib Eye. In addition we had the bacon app, 2 wedge salads, baked potato and Mac n Cheese. I have two complaints about the place...I ordered an Arnold Palmer - horrible, it tasted like straight lemon juice. The server only got me more ice tea but it didn't help, I just ended up drinking the ice tea. Not a huge biggie, just a drink. I had the Mac and Cheese as my side. It was so gross, I took two bites (the second to make sure it wasn't just a bad bite) and didn't touch it again. The worst Mac and Cheese I've ever had, it tasted rancid and there was a distinct nasty texture, like it was made from a box (but worse) or something. Other then those two things, our steaks were fantastic and cooked perfect!"}
{"text":"The duck liver mousse takes a distinct palate to like it. However, the bone-in NY strip was great, the butter added a great flavor. Of course the popovers were amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week and was very excited to try it.  I got the watermelon feta salad, hanger steak, and lemon tart.  The salad was not what I had hoped. It was very boring with watermelon that were not exactly ripe.  Most of them were white in color and bitter.  There were 3 pieces of arugula...what do you with that?! And the dressing was scarce and flavorless.    The hanger steak was cooked as I asked, medium.  It was extremely fatty and I could not finish it. The tart was ok, I tried my friend's chocolate PB mousse, which was very good.  The meringue on the tart was my favorite part of the whole meal, which is disappointing because I spent $40.    I hate writing bad reviews and I hate complaining, but seriously?  It's pretty frustrating when you try a place for the first time, look forward to it all day, and get the results I got here.    The staff is awesome and friendly.  I loved my waiter and he was super accommodating.  They are a good team and seem to be very caring of their customers.  I just wish I had better food for what I expected and paid."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We used to eat frequently at Bally's steakhouse and finally decided to try BLT based on recommendations.  The tuna tartar was amazing!  My rib eye was perfectly cooked, very tasty. The truffle mashed potatoes the best I've had.  To top it off the bananna creme pie with a crushed pecan crust AMAZING!  The best part was our service was second to none!  Omar our server explained the menu in detail and he made us all feel like good friends.  Ask for his table when you go. He won't disappoint. Made our night a memorable one! All and all a great choice to dine. We will return!"}
{"text":"Pros: food is good. Steak good. Sides ok. Wait staff good.  Cons: Bar staff. I went to order drinks at the bar for our party of 7 while waiting for the table to be ready. The bartender ignored me for over 5 minutes.  When he did finally acknowledge me and I asked if I could order drinks I was told very rudely I was standing in the wrong spot to order drinks! There was no obvious spot that I could see designated for ordering drinks. This was the beginning of our experience so not a good start.  Probably would not go back due to the poor experience."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Popovers are amazing! Even if you hate brussel sprouts, I dare you to order them! They are incredibly sweet and savory! I had the lamb, smaller portion than the filet mignon but so delicious!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were celebrating our birthdays and treating ourselves to a really good steak dinner.   Had not eaten at  BLT before but we were staying at Paris next door and  decided to try it.  We were seated promptly and our server appeared in a few minutes.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Complementary fois gras was served with crostini. It was very good. They also served popovers which were the highlight of our meal.   We both ordered the Waygu filet mignon, mine medium rare and hers rare.  We also ordered stuffed mushrooms and green beans.  The stuffed mushrooms were good but very heavily salted.  When the steaks arrived, each was not cooked as we ordered.  Hers was medium and mine medium well.  They were topped with an herb mix which was also too heavily salted.  We were going to a show and it had taken quite a long time for the meal to arrive so we did not complain about the salt but did ask my daughter's steak to be redone.  I just ate the one I had ordered.  The service had dropped off after the food came and we didn't get water glasses refilled.  No one came near to ask.  My steak was very dry.  It took some time for the other steak to appear.  Overall, we didn't enjoy the meal here nearly as much as other steak houses we have been to in Vegas.   The chef can't cook Waygu filet as ordered and pretty much destroyed it.  I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"While searching for a place to eat steak my husband found this place with a discount on travelzoo. For 2ppl up to $208 worth of food and drinks was $115 with the discount. Pretty good deal. Hub ordered an aged 22oz ribeye with bone marrow and I got the filet minion. Both were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust outside. I was worried it would be too salty but it was seasoned well. Sides were mushroom and super creamy Mac and cheese. The crab cake was delicious nice large chunks of crab meat and  not over cooked or dry. Complimentary were Their pop over bread was to die for, with the butters and sea salt as well as crostini and pate, and little brownie bites. Saving the best for last we shared the peanut butter mousse with banana ice cream! Overall service was excellent and beautiful food presentation!"}
{"text":"My company came here for a group dinner. It was about 9 is plus a baby. They were very accommodating. The ambiance was really sophisticated and elegant. Staff was very attentive and patient. We ordered a ton of apps and shared, as well as sides to share. Everything was cooked well(exactly as ordered) and seasoned perfectly! I stepped out in faith and ordered sea bass. It was amazing! I even tried chicken liver - not my cup of tea but everyone else enjoyed it. I enjoyed a glass of rose and others a red wine. Overall it was a great experience at a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (now fiancé) and I got engaged on my birthday and decided to celebrate at BLT steak. I am so happy we picked this restaurant because of course the food was exceptional but the service was mind blowing. The server (Sam) was attentive and caring and the manager personally congratulated us with two very fancy bottles of champagne. They also made sure I ordered desert and said it was on the house. I could not of been more surprised to find out that they gave us the entire meal for free to help us celebrate a very special day. I would recommend this restaurant to a vegan just so they could experience the service. Only downside is now when I go to any other fancy restaurant it will never compare."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey should be proud of his award winning Hells Kitchen Chef!!   This was by far our best dining experience in Vegas over the 8 days we were here. Our waiter was very attentive and we were seated at a table against the wall. We had a Travelzoo voucher that was money will spent.   We started with the beautiful popovers that were piping hot. Cute recipe came with it.   Amuse Bouche of duck liver pate. Not my fave but then again not a live pate fan  Appetizer was Burrata toy box tomatoes and fresh mozzarella (this is on my top ten favorite things I've ever eaten) the tomatoes were unlike any I'd ever had before. Sweet and tart at same time. It was addictive.   My spouse  and I then split the Lobster Cobb which was more than enough for two and relishes.   I ordered petite filet with potato skins which was great but a tiny bit dry even tho it was cooked perfectly. Needed butter. I was to full to eat potatoes by this time which is probably why I thought my steak was just pretty darn good lol. I'd still say everything was perfect.   Hubby had bone in ribeye and bone marrow as well as a potato baked. He devoured it. Medium rare and perfect.   I didn't want dessert. Ok I'm lying of course I wanted dessert I'm on vacation :). If it's on the menu and you don't order it then shame on you. Seriously your loss. Best dessert of my life. Banana cream pie. Hmmm really you ask?  Yes really. Pecan crusted banana cream pie. I dream of this pie.   Go. It's not cheap. Paying full price will set you back 240$ for what we ordered but it was an event if two hours and put me to bed early so saved easily that much gambling!"}
{"text":"I found BLT when they launched on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California. Well, they last a few years, then left this market.  So, when I'm in Las Vegas, BLT is always a place that I eat at. They offer great service, amazing food and an excellent steak.  BLT is my favorite steak place next to Ruth's Chris.   Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to say with the name I was expecting casual, nothing special but this was an amazing treat that was unexpected   we came after a recommendation from a cocktail waitress at the Paris.  The appetizers were nothing special however the entrees were exceptional. My friends had the Filet mignon and I had the branzino.   we also ordered the stuffed mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes.  wow, wow wow  This is one of those meals that I wish my tummy were bigger because I wanted more and more.    The waitress was sweet, the assistant was clumsy and uncomfortable and kept putting everything in the wrong place which was no big deal. The food made up for everything."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the dining experience throughly.  Excellent table, views, and service.  Gordon Ramsey lives up to his reputation.  Family of four ate well and our waiter had been with the company for 20 years, let's say we wanted for nothing.  Only issue would be the restrooms are out of restaurant and across casino; not user friendly for such a scrumptious eatery."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today with several co-workers and the meal was underwhelming for the price.  The large pop-overs were a nice way to start the meal.  I had the steak wedge salad.  The steak was cooked perfectly, but had practically no seasoning.  The char on the steak would have been acceptable, except there was no seasoning or sauce to counterbalance the flavor.  The lettuce wedge was browned on the edges, indicating that it had been cut some time before serving or it had sat in storage too long.  The dressing was nothing spectacular.  The salt shakers they set out do not allow enough salt to pour out, which is much needed for the under seasoned food.  Our server was not very enthusiastic, but I don't really expect much from a server for lunch - however, he was attentive.  Overall, everything was fine, other than the brown lettuce, but I don't plan on returning because of the price of my meal and the poor quality of the food.  I guess I should have thought this was going to be an overpriced hotel bar that you would find at any random hotel, instead of thinking it was a nice restaurant with quality food - perhaps they are more of a dinner place."}
{"text":"I could write a bunch of how incredible the food and service was but I will keep it simple..... THIS IS A MUST!!!!! Just go!  1 piece of advice is most likely split a steak unless you have a place to store leftovers."}
{"text":"There are many adjectives in the English language to describe the experience, but awesome will suffice for now. Service from top to bottom front of house to back of the house was impeccable. Attentive prompt and intuitive. The only thing My bf would recommend not doing is wearing tailored slacks. ......Huge mistake. The quality and portion sizes will cause you to over indulge and will make for a very uncomfortable situation in anything less than sweats."}
{"text":"Such a great experience. Food was great and service was even better. We came in with a Travelzoo coupon. I was suspicious that they might not treat us as well because of that. Sergio was an incredible server. Very special meal. Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Years ago, I dined at BLT Burger and enjoyed it, so I figured that I would give BLT Steak a try. It was a girl's night out and we were celebrating a birthday.  I did not expect a restaurant of this caliber inside of Bally's. The décor was beautiful - they used lots of wood to give it that masculine steakhouse feel without making the dining room appear old or dated.  Our server was Omar and he was outstanding!  Here's the run-down of what we ordered:  -Tuna Tartare with avocado and soy-lime dressing (A) -Caesar Salad (B-) -Popovers (A+++) -American Wagyu Filet Mignon (B) -Filet Mignon (B) -Mac & Cheese (A+) -Mashed Potatoes (A) -Brussel Sprouts (B) -Onion Rings (B-) -Sauteed Mushrooms (C) -Crepe Souffle with passion fruit sauce (A+) -Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse (B-) -Chocolate Praline Tart (C+) -Chamomile tea, ginger ale, and a bottled water  This meal ran us $338 for a party of three hungry women."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for the former Bally's Steak House that was replaced by BLT Steak.  We stopped in on Monday, Oct 16, to see if they would honor it.  The manager came out and was so nice and gracious.  He looked it over and said it would be no problem.   We were expecting a \"Sorry, but no\" response, so we were pleasantly surprised. We were planning to return later for dinner, so the manager offered to sign it so we would not have any problems.  We walked out feeling great and anticipating our return for dinner.   Dinner was fabulous!  We had the Dover Sole - it was light and flaky with a mouth-watering brown butter sauce.  Hopefully I can get that again someday, as I am already craving it.  The green beans were cooked perfectly al dente. We ate at the bar and the service was fun and friendly, yet not in any way intrusive.  Our bartender knew the perfect balance of when to visit with us and when not to.  Loved the food and the customer service was outstanding.  It was our last dinner after 5 nights in Vegas and it was the best.  A definite repeat!"}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for their wedding anniversary dinner since we were staying at the hotel. It was Saturday night and we made reservations for 7:30pm. There was a brief wait before we were seated at our table which gave us some time to take some photos for memories.   My parents and I were sat in the dining area in a nice booth that faced the bar. Our waiter was very personable and went over the menu so we can better make our decision as well as let us know the specials.  We ordered : Chopped salad (4/5) Shrimp Cocktail (5/5) Dry aged wagyu filet mignon (3/5) Scottish salmon (5/5) Mashed potatoes (5/5) Green beans (3/5)  We also had some red wine and Heineken to quench our thirst. The good was great I wish the sides were a little bigger portions. They did bring out some appetizers for us prior to the pop overs. There was some pate with a jelly on top, some other toast with bacon, samples of salami, chorizo, and prosciutto that was great to pair with the wine. We also had a small plate of petite fours for dessert. I was hoping we may get a free slice of cake or dessert for my parents celebration but nothing was offered.   I'd like to come back and try their Sterling Brunch some time."}
{"text":"Since the head chef here is the chef who won hell's kitchen, my best friend wanted to try this place too.  Since we were so disappointed with our visit to Ramsay's, we were both going to BLT with such low expectations.  The group decided to go to Bally's to play at the tables a bit before dinner so my best friend decided to check out BLT.  He was told that the vendors are the same as Ramsay's steakhouse, so we were iffy on going but since we were already waiting we just went with it.  We already knew what we wanted.  We got the duck fat fries, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, he got the bone in ribeye and i got the rack of lamb.  We were also given duck pate which was delicious and their gruyere popovers were so good.  So far so good.  Our sides came with our entrees.  I didn't like our duck fries, they were wedges instead of actual fries.  I think it would have been a lot better if they were actual fries.  The mashed potatoes were good, the cream spinach was okay, and the mac and cheese wasnt too bad.  The lambs were cooked to perfection and his ribeye was nice and juicy.  We were in and out of there in an hour.  Our visit was so much better than Ramsay's place and it was cheaper too."}
{"text":"What a let down.  Gordon Ramsey and his Hell's Kitchen winner are on auto pilot here. The staff were all roaming around and chatting with one another not being attentive to their customers. We were seated and asked if we would like drinks. I gave my order and my wife and I also wanted some water. Pretty basic. 10 minutes later and after 3 different staff members gave water to tables around us we finally had a different waiter come over and ask if we had been helped yet. We told him and he got us some water and spoke to our original waiter who then took our order. My wife's Filet mignon was perfect. However my Bone in New York was pretty much raw in the middle. MR does not mean middle raw. By the time I came to the rawness I did not send it back.  I was pretty much done with it, and the poor service. Sloppy table, they never cleaned anything up when they would pick up a plate. When everything was said and done I was charged for a dessert that I didn't order. He took it off when I pointed it out. But never again. $250 with tip for two.  Ruth's Chris is a superior Steak house, by far. Don't waist your time here."}
{"text":"Juan is a great server! He was very informative, and could answer every question I had about the menu. I had the NY strip steak and it was fabulous. Juan definitely made my first experience at this restaurant a great one!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner last night. We sat at the bar and enjoyed happy hour drinks and ended up eating dinner as well. We both started with salads (I had the Caesar  and she had the beet salad). Then we shared the rack of lamb and the stuffed mushrooms. This was hands down the best meal I ever had. The lamb was my favorite! Packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. To top things off we had a piece of the banana cream pie. It was amazing!  While the food and drinks were amazing, the service is really what knocked us off our feet. Omar and Rob both took care of us and were just an absolute delight! What gems you have with these two!!! We will be back and be requesting another night that they are working. Thank you gentleman!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, had a $100 diamond voucher for any Harrahs restaurant. Decided to use it at BLT and it was pretty good. This was my second time here and this time we had the porter house for two. It was really good especially the filet side so tender no teeth needed. The best side was on the seasonal menu which has the corn with lobster and jalepeno that was so good. The creamed spinach was ok.   When you sit down they give you pop overs made with milk and Gruyere cheese it's good but will fill you up. Then they give you complementary pate with crustini and some sliced chucuteri. So don't over do it on the appetizers you'll get full before the main course and won't enjoy the steak.   Just a tip any high end restaurant in Las Vegas you don't need to dress up if you go to the bar, they have the full menu.  I was able to get into BLT wearing shorts and shirt. I'm sure they rather have you dress  business casual but basically if you can afford it they take your business.  Porter house and 2 sides which is a lot of food for two was $125 not bad."}
{"text":"came on a Travelzoo deal. mama ordered the rack of lamb and i got the short rib. maybe it was because of my aversion to eating red meat on a frequent basis that the short rib was just, eh. wasn't very impressed with it. very fatty. i mean, i could feel my arteries clogging as i sipped on the ice water. mama's rack of lamb was delicious. well cooked and seasoned.  service was great. server was on top of things and very available. busser came around to clean up plates and refill water frequently. decor was nice, dark and cozy. front desk was also hospitable with getting us in on our reservation time.   overall, an ok experience. maybe i'll order a steak next time if we grab another deal."}
{"text":"Impeccable service even at the bar. Especially at the bar. Don't forget they have 5 dollar apps from 5 to 7. At BLT that actually means something."}
{"text":"Go see Hugo and Lawrence. Top to bottom from service, ambiance, and food was amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My husband Chris and I dined here for our one year anniversary and it did not disappoint. Our server Keith was super knowledgeable and went above and beyond to ensure that our time here was memorable. We started off with the hamachi which was so delicious. The popovers might as well be heaven on a plate. My husband ordered the 22oz bone in Ribeye which was to die for and I went with the Grouper special. We wish we could eat this all over again. The quality was amazing. Thank you for making this a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse I ever tasted ! Amazing cocktails and wines ! Appetizers are also pretty insane! The tuna tartare was so soft and fresh ... Melting on the tongue ! Divine. And the meat ... Can't describe how satisfying this experience was! I couldn't put 5 stars because of the staff, some of them were cold and made us feel like we were disturbing while others were really friendly ... Still an amazing experience I recommend !"}
{"text":"We used to go to the BLT in LA and loved it. We decided to try BLT in Vegas and see how it compared to the old BLT. It was very close and still very good. Service is always top notch here and they seem to anticipate every need. The popovers are fun and very tasty. The ahi tartar is fresh and very good. The streaks of course are good and finish with the carrot cake! The place is darker then normal and I love that, gives it character."}
{"text":"Simply the best steakhouse dinner.  Served by tony... And his assistant.  Both very attentive and friendly.  Started with shrimp cocktail, wedge salad, and the complimentary popovers.  My husband had the lobster and I had the fillet mignon.  Both were seasoned well and cooked to perfection... We shared the loaded baked potato.  To finish- we ended with the most creamiest and lightest banana cream pie.  We used to come when it was ballys steakhouse and nice to see some of the same faces working at blt."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Nervous, shorthanded, lackluster service. Over cooked, very dry bread, very low quality beef, overdressed wilted Caesar salad, flavorless mushrooms, and sad, soupy, mash potatoes. Highlight of the night was when the server told us about their \"Fresh\" Dover sole fish...that was from England. Seriously? Fresh from across the pond?  Total amount spent for 2 people and disingenuous experience for nearly $300.   Oh, and I am writing this review as I am wrapping a great meal Mastro's Streak house in Crystals Mall at city center."}
{"text":"Celebrating our wedding anniversary.  Food was what you'd expect from a steakhouse at this price range.  What sets restaurants apart is the level of service.  I was disappointed in the level of service in celebrating our wedding anniversary. Barely recognized our arrival and even less when we were leaving.  The manager didn't come by our table once to see how things were going.  We told them during the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and not a single person recognized this during our dinner.    Bottom line:  Bally's hotel does not seem to be on par with other establishments and the BLT steak is no different.  We wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay Steak, but time available did not work out with us.  We'll have to call them early next time.  Do not waste your time/money with BLT Steak!"}
{"text":"We love it here!  Been four or five times over the last few years, usually for an anniversary dinner.  A few years back they went from a traditional style steak house to a more modern style.  However, food has stayed amazing over the years.  Starter popovers and Pate' are absolutely delicious. Salad wedge, loaded baked potato, and New York strip were so generously sized that we decided to share. Steak was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. We got the banana cream pie last time.  We planned to again, but we're too full.  You won't be disappointed in this place.  Our server, Doug, and his assistant, were terrific!  They made a wonderful experience even better, and were genuinely making sure we were well taken care of.  He even gave us a couple brownie bites to try.  So good!  Wish we had room for dessert!!"}
{"text":"The veal was wayyyyyyyy toooooooo salty, my onions rings were greasy and the bone marrow dripped with oil. The service was on par with this established brand. I enjoyed the drinks. If I come back, I'll stick to drinks during happy hour, oysters and tuna."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the 22oz Ribeye each, with a side of the ratatouille and the baked potato wedges! The food was excellent and tasteful. The customer service was friendly and fast. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had the salad at Lunch and it was very good as is their soup.  The waiter was excellent and attentive!  I cant remember his name but he has been there for a while....he's the chocolate man :-) :-) :-) (Speaking in food terminology...LOL)  who speaks well, is very polite, genuine and knows the menu well! He recommended the turkey burger to my hubby and he said it was one of the best he has ever had!!!!!!    Kuddos!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"A perfect dinner experience in a shabby hotel. I would have never expected that kind of restaurant within the Ballys Hotel. I sat at the bar with full menu. The staff is super friendly. Stephanie took care of me and made dinner a super pleasant experience.  The bread called popovers are phenomenal. They even give you a little card with the recipe. I started with Tuna Tartar. That came on ice with a super tasty yet slightly spicy sauce. Then I had the dry aged bone in New York strip steak. OMG. That char was tasty and cooked to perfection. Huge portion. I wasn't able to finish the Bruxelles sprouts. Those tasted like my mother used to make them. I must admit. This place is a gem in a old place. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know how we did it, but we managed to power through two 22 oz bone in ribeye steaks, macaroni, stuffed mushrooms, popover bread, a caesar salad, and some other small bites. Dessert was banana cream pie and the pie filling had the consistency of whipped cream instead of custard.  If you don't think you can finish off a big steak, then order a smaller one. Its not worth the price to take leftovers and trying to heat it up later.  Fortunately we had a voucher that gave us a little relief from the $200 bill. This is a dinner only place so make a reservation if you feel like it because it filled up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't turn down an invitation to return if a group wanted to go, the food was still decent after all.  But I would give the effort to talk everyone into a different venue all factors considered.  When determining my overall rating, I asked myself if I would choose this over Ruth's Chris up the street at Harrah's, and the answer was \"no\".     We were seated at a table with a distant view of the big specials board to the rear of the main dining room.  On my left were a bunch of douches in tank tops and shorts, while on the far right was a very casual date where the guy was sporting flip flops...with socks on!  The group of four straight ahead placed a Fat Tuesday's yard drink on the table as if it were a wedding reception centerpiece.  Classy!  I regretted not wearing my best pizza sauce stained wifebeater and fluorescent green breakaway track pants.    If brought to the table blindfolded, I wouldn't have argued had I been told this was Grand Lux Cafe.  It was only by the time our lobster cobb salad was served that I noticed the left section of the restaurant, which seemed much more secluded and dimly lit.  If I am to spend as I would at any other steakhouse on the strip, the joint should play the part.  I wouldn't celebrate an anniversary here.    One may think twice about ordering that starchy side dish after they bring out the complimentary carbs.   BLT's signature popover was a delicious detour from the traditional roll and butter.   The exterior featured a delightful burnt cheese top which I went for first before getting into the soft, doughy, croissant-like center.  I want to dive into a huge ball pit full of these and eat my way out.      As expected, the rare porterhouse was the best part of dinner.   It was very thick, sufficiently juicy, and the herb butter enhanced the overall flavor nicely.  The outer charred crust complemented the cool bloody center of each piece and made for an enjoyable chew.  It bordered on a \"Pittsburgh style\" steak which I quite like when done right.  3.75 stars for the meat.  Both sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes lacked in temperature and were sent back upon first taste.  Our super friendly server, Leslie, was very apologetic.  The manager, Tammy, took my wife's glass of wine off the bill as compensation which was cool of them.  It was unfortunate that the re-cooked sides didn't arrive until we were pretty close to wrapping up the meal.   One and most likely done.  I like when eating a steak on the strip feels victorious.  So much so that I want to march out with the t-bone held up high like it were the Olympic torch and Chariots of Fire music is playing.  I didn't feel anywhere close to that here."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, awesome atmosphere.  It is a great place to bring a client.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came out with friends and really wanted to show them this great place I came to last year, boy have times changed. Once seated waiting 15 minutes for water, WATER... Really sad because I really liked this place. Service really bad, food was great but the sever needs some serous help..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to s good Steakhouse in a while, and decided to eat here because it was comped by Ballys as I am a Total Rewards - 7 Star Member.  Sunday, May 27, 2018 ( Memorial Day Weekend) We decided to eat here around 530pm, before our show.  All tables were reserved, but there was seating at the bar.  The bar is at the front of the restaurant.  After we ordered our cocktails, they served their Signature Poppers. This bread was so airy, warm and delicious, and had gruyere cheese baked in.  This has to be the best bread I've had in my life. Add a little butter, and it melts in your mouth.   I ordered their Tuna Tartar appetizer,  which was not just delicious, but amazing presentation.  Tuna on top of avocado, and served with crisps.  We split a Lobster Cobb Salad, which had large Lobster Claws.  Nice tasting salad, and large enough to split for 2 people.  After getting full from the bread, appetizer and salad, we awaited our 28 day aged New York Strip Steak, and ordered a side of cream spinach.  Steak was cooked perfected, and flavor was excellent.   Sides are not included with the Steak, but you may not need it because their poppers (bread) can fill you up.  Warm Poppers - Complimentary Tuna Tartar - $20 Lobster Cobb Salad - $24 New York Strip 16oz - $63 Creamed Spinach - $12  Total with cocktails - $145  Dress Code  Casual, ok to wear jeans, but I wouldn't wear swimsuits to this establishment.  Staff & Service Very friendly and fast service  Reservations I would definitely make a reservation, as all tables were booked  Food American Bistro - Excellent  Large menu  I recommend this Restaurant if you are looking for a good steak and want upscale flair. I will be going here again because of excellent customer service and food.  Food was served in good sized portions."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour experience after a long day at a conference. Wandered through Bally's in a tired, slightly-hungover and starving state seeking an upscale place for appetizers and stumbled upon this gem. Lawrence, the GM, was about to escort me to a seat when he was rudely interrupted by a patron who clearly did not fit the intended audience of the restaurant and chose to start a scene regarding how she felt \"disrespected\". He promptly attended to her concerns and was apologetic for the disruption and my inconvenience. He sat me in a secluded seating area and recommended the tuna tartar. It also included a to-die-for popover with Gruyere geese and butter which paired with an IPA was a quick fix for my lingering hangover. I'm so glad I stumbled into this surprise inside Bally's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is almost hidden inside of Ballys. Atmosphere is upscale yet casual at the same time. We sat at the bar, which offered the same menu as the dining area. The bar tenders were absolutely fabulous! Super helpful, quick with drinks and food service! It seems the employees genuinely enjoy their jobs. The menu is pricey but, this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and you get what you pay for! Food was phenomenal! Drinks were our of this world, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed a lot of $50 pieces of meat so I would consider myself a well travelled foodie. This was good but I have tasted better.   When we pointed out that our meat was over cooked to our waitress, she said she was going to tell the manager. Manager never showed up.   Disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. My wife and I ate here, and both of us had something wrong with our meal.  My steak was overcooked slightly, normally I wouldn't care but since it was $60, I had to send it back.  My wife asked for the Truffled Mac and Cheese for her side. When the food came out, the waiter brought out Truffled Mashed Potatoes. We asked the waiter about this, and he said \"Oh, but you said the Truffled Pototes.\" He then asked, \"Well do you still want the mac and cheese?\"  After we got all the sides figured out, we had a chance to talk about this with the manager. He apologized for the service. I was still disappointed in everything, especially since the bill was $160 for two steaks, two sides, and two glasses of water (the water was free)."}
{"text":"There is the certain sophistication of taking guests to dinner at this modern restaurant in the Ritz Carlton. Unfortunately, the total dining experience is not quite as good as should be expected st the maximum price point. Always use the valet parking as it is free if you get your receipt stamped. Upon entering the lobby of the Ritz you may be greeted by hotel employees who want to make sure you are coming there to spend money rather than to just hang out. The lobby is elegant and the lobby bar is always hopping and often has live music. BLT itself is past the bar to the right. The atmosphere is a little too austere in its simplicity and can easily be seen as the \"hotel\" restaurant that it is, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The service is generally strong and the pacing is good though we had a lag at the end in getting our dessert order taken. The service is four stars. Where they fall a bit here is in the food itself. The porterhouse for two just seemed to be a bit tough and I'm not sure that the way they carve it is conducive to getting the most tender bites. I definitely grill a better steak at my house using Harris Teeter angus beef which is often on sale at $7.99 a pound for porterhouse. So when I pay $87 for the porterhouse for two it better be distinguishable in a good way from the one I grill at the house. It wasn't. The BBQ corn and mushroom sides are great but the portions are a bit small for communal sides. The jalapeño mashed potatoes have little flavor. The creamed spinach as adequate. I think my overall rating here may be biased because perhaps I am questioning the value that is offered by these fancy steakhouses such as BLT, Palm and Morton's and it may be because I am spoiled. It is an adequate dining experience but not remarkable enough to justify the cost."}
{"text":"Had dinner last Thursday night at BLT. I WAS BLOWN away by this resturant. I had low expectations since Bally's is not my most favorite hotel in Vegas, it's become run down and squeezed out by surrounding construction. I remember when it first opened as The MGM Grand and, at the time, was the finest hotel on the strip. My meal, service and surroundings were sensational. It was very expensive but I never mind paying for a great experience. Loved it."}
{"text":"I paid $65 for a steak that I could've grilled better myself. $65 and that's just for the steak itself. That doesn't get you any sides or anything so I paid $12 for a fully loaded baked potato in which I had to put the toppings on, myself. I'm not saying I'm lazy. Trust me, I have no problems with putting on my own toppings but if I'm paying $12 for a fully loaded baked potato, I expect the toppings to already be on my potato before it's brought to my table. I swear that my wallet went into cardiac arrest. The steak I ordered was the bone in ribeye, which our server, Sergio, had said was the house special. What was so special about it besides the price? Hell if I know. If you're looking for a great steak experience, got to Fogo De Chao or Texas De Brazil instead. Those fools know how to cook steak. If you're looking for mediocre steak at a ghastly price, then look no further than BLT Steak. I will say though that the service was excellent and Sergio was most attentive."}
{"text":"We came here with a large party and we had a wonderful time. The waitresses were absolutely marvelous and they were attentive and well mannered. The food was magnificent. The asparagus, stuffed mushrooms, seared Branzino were perfection. To top it off i had a soft cheesecake that was not too heavy and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Ally and Leslie once again were simply marvelous! Five stars!"}
{"text":"t is always difficult to assign stars to rating a restaurant when the food is, in fact, quite good but other features of the dining experience are not so good. To be honest, the food here is quite good. The steak was perfectly prepared, seared just as it should have been and wonderfully seasoned. My wife's roast chicken was also delicious. The problem is that when I go to a restaurant, I want a meal. But every item here is served a la cartè  and a la expensive! For my $56, I got a slab of meat. My iced tea was $4.50. and side dishes like green beans or rice or mashed potatoes were $11 each. Salads were even higher priced, but I did not order one, so I do not know how large they are or if they are a good value for the money. Again, the food WAS delicious, but when I want a slab of meat, I go to the butcher, When I go to a restaurant, I want a meal. And $4.50 for iced tea is a little hard to understand."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent (yummy) food. Clean, nice environment. Pricey but it's high end so that's expected and well worth it."}
{"text":"Food, staff and restaurant...AMAZING!  Loved everything. Banana cream pie was over-the-top delicious!  Steak was cooked perfectly and I would recommend sweet potato mash.  All was off the chain good. this place will wow you!!"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 6. We had a reservation for 8:45pm and they seated us about 10-15 min late. We ordered drinks, got them, and then ordered our dinner. The chef sent out duck pate with crackers and it was tasty! One of the waitstaff tried to pick up our appetizer before we were finished (that's a no no). The popovers were absolutely delicious!! They even give you the recipe for them! Everyone got a steak and at least one side and we ordered an onion ring for the table. This is when everything started to get messy. The waitress brought out wrong sides (at least our main dishes were right). Extra spinach, no Mac n cheese. When we told her to nix the onion rings she said \"I was waiting for you to mention them, otherwise I was just going to take them off anyway.\" Seriously, who does that?  Ambiance-4 stars Food-4 stars Service-2 stars"}
{"text":"BLT is located inside Bally's, one of the older hotel casinos.   The menu is ala cart. I had the bone-in ribeye. $60. Was it worth it? Well, consider the meat is excellent, the steak was large and this restaurant comes with all the pretense of a high-priced steakhouse, yeah, sure, if you want to treat yourself.   I also got a baked potato which was the size of a small football. They must be growing these is some of abandoned nuclear test sites nearby. Total meal price: $90  I found the wall bench seating and the table height out of sync. The table was so high I felt like I was back at the kids table at Thanksgiving. I had to reach up to keep my sleeves out of things and kept knocking things over. I noticed the same thing at another Bally's restaurant. It seems to be an overall design flaw.   I thought it was funny that you are given a complimentary \"popup\" I believe they called it. It's really just Yorkshire Pudding (flour, water baked in hot oil until it puffs out).   So it's a good place for a treat. It's highbrow for Bally's. Be careful ordering too much. The serving sizes are big."}
{"text":"We made this our first foodie experience in Vegas. We waded through the casino to a restaurant tucked between several different offerings. Translation: we never would have found it on our own. We found out about it through Travelzoo. I would recommend the filet mignon, the popovers, the tuna tartare, brussel sprouts, and souffle. Margot and Willie provided outstanding service! We went over our voucher a bit, but we literally had breakfast for two with the leftovers. My 22oz ribeye was waaaay more than I needed. Come here for great food and service, but be careful not to overdose on the popovers. I filled up quickly, even though I only had a few bites of my popover.  Last tip: come early and enjoy half price appetizers at the bar! It won't count towards your voucher, most likely, but it's a great way to get the party started."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently visited BLT Las Vegas, because we are huge fans of Hells Kitchen and it was her birthday. Our original waiter was excellent, he was trying to manage multiple tables so our food was delayed. Everything was going well until a party of 20 arrived, some of the staff referred to this party as a group of \"tattooed & piercing people.\" Not sure what the relevance of that comment was about. Anyway, while eating our appetizers a short red haired lady with an \"ankle tattoo\" arrived at our table. She placed her hand on my plate asking if I was done, I said no. My fiancé wore a tiara, ankle tattoo made a rude comment saying \"I hope it's your birthday or are you a princess for the day.\" Minutes go by when Ankle tattoo arrives with our entrees, while I'm still eating my appetizer she moves my plate to the side without even asking. I later found out from our server, ankle tattoo was the BLT manager. Feeling disrespected and on an dinning time limit, my fiancé and I took our uneaten entrees to go. This was our first and last time at BLT steakhouse. I have been in touch with PR, hopefully they can hire professionally considerate management from this point forward."}
{"text":"Holy salt lick! The level of salt this place uses is truly extraordinary. The pros: popovers are fantastic and always a treat. Good service. Good wine selection. The not so good: overly dressed salad and the steaks are absolutely drenched in salt. To the point where it's almost inedible. The meat is very tender but every bite leaves this acidic taste on your tongue and you will be buying overpriced Vegas water for the rest of your trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this past Saturday to celebrate our Anniversary. Service was horrible and weren't very busy. Our waitress was rude and not very knowledgeable about pairing drinks with the food.  I had high expectations for this restaurant with the fact that Gorden Ramsey used it in his Hells Kitchen show and having gone to Ramsey ' s Steak restraunt I expected similar service and high standards on food quality . I gave it 2 stars because the bartender ' s very nice an attentive. Never going back and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Started with a Caesar salad that was good but definitely not the best Ive ever had. Both the BF and I ordered the Bone in Ribeye with marrow which was melt in your mouth phenomenal. I ordered the blue cheese sauce to accompany and it was sharp and rich and complimented perfectly with the beef. I also ordered the creamed spinach and that was delicious. He ordered the fries with cilantro mayo and they were fantastic. The entire table LOVED their meal, the service was pretty good considering we were a large party at it was almost 10 p.m..  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a long week of traveling and work in Vegas,  I decided to treat myself to a steak.  I was there alone and the thought of taking a steak up to my hotel room and ravaging it in my bed while watching Forensic Files was very appealing.  The high reviews on yelp had me really excited, so I sat at the bar, and ordered a bone in rib eye to go.  The bartender was very friendly and told me about 30 minutes.  The steak was $64, which I was ok, with thinking it would be a 4-5 star meal.  Sadly I was underwhelmed once I got that piece of meat back up to my room.    The char on the steak was wayyyy too thick and crusty, it overpowered the beautiful natural taste of the rib eye.  I was really surprised and disappointed.  I had not eaten all day and ate a few bites, but just tossed the rest (my dog would be so pissed at me) .  I have had some really excellent steaks in Vegas and this was by far the worst and felt like a waste of money and my fantasy of devouring a beautiful steak in my hotel room after a long week of work.     Maybe it was an off night, because the couple next to me as I waited ordered short ribs and had to send them back and were so bothered they did not want another.   Also, lame no sides come with the steak.  Would not recommend. Sad!"}
{"text":"There are few times in life you get as great of food as you get service. Sam Craig made our experience memorable and knew the menu like the back of his hand. This restaurant is great and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this place! I had order filet mignon and it came out perfect ! I had also order some sides and wine that paired great with my food!"}
{"text":"I had a reservation months ahead and still had a lil of a wait. My waiter was awesome and had jokes. I enjoyed all the food but thought the selection could have been bigger. The people I was with thought the lobster was over cooked but I had plenty no problem. Plenty of champagne of course and I enjoyed the caviar. I think it was more exciting having seen 2chainz eat there on tv then actually being there, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Recently went to BLT Steak fora holiday dinner. We started at the bar and found the bartender to be friendly and informed. When we sat we were greeted and given some great suggestions from the server. My first time at a steak place I always order a filet so i get a good feel for how everything else is. The steak was very good, one of the best ive had in Charlotte by far. The thing that stood out here though was the appetizers and side dishes! The popover bread is easily a must have and the side of bbq corn was excellent."}
{"text":"It is a great pace to eat, highly recommended! The banana cream pie is a must! I also recommend the filet, very tender."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood platter for 3 ($100) and the porterhouse for 2 ($95). Quality-wise, the seafood platter was not worth the $100. The shrimp cocktail was good but the crab legs were still icy. If I'm paying $100 for it, please at least make sure the seafood are fully defrosted. Now, my porterhouse steak for two was awesome!  Cooked to perfection, and is worth the $95. I'll be back but would skip the seafood platter. Oh - not sure if it's part of how the severs were trained, but my server was extremely pushy which took me by surprise, since I'm at the restaurant and not at a car dealership. He wanted to sell me everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The complimentary Yorkshire pudding is one of the best. The service and food is outstanding. You haven't gone you need to."}
{"text":"The popovers were delicious!  We ordered the porterhouse for two with the spinach side...delicious.  Javier was our server and gave us excellent service!"}
{"text":"This was the most awesome steak ever. Had the 28 day aged NYT bone in. Heavenly. Expensive but by far the best steaks I have had."}
{"text":"The best meal we had in Las Vegas. We live in a vegetarian household, so a chance to have steak when we are away is a real treat. The whole experience was first rate, from creative cocktails to the prime rib itself. Most memorable were the delicious popovers! What a nice and yummy change from ordinary rolls..."}
{"text":"Great service: Omar, the gentleman who assisted us, is extremely knowledgeable on all the menu items, very friendly and pleasant to be with. Jay, kept the water and beverage replenished, the table was always clean, and the used tableware was changed right after we were done.   American Wagyu Rib eye 12oz at $92: Amazing taste, juicy and very tender. You can definitely taste the quality of meat. Highly recommended in median-rare if you are a steak lover.  Bone in Rib eye 22oz at $55: This one comes with bone marrow which is very tasty and flavorful.    28-days Dry aged Bone-in NY 20oz at $61: Nicely cooked for the central part, but I don't like the burned bitterness of the surface.  Filet Mignon 10oz at $56:   Very thick piece, perfectly cooked to pink.   Sides: Creamed spinach & Grilled asparagus $11 each, Baked potato (creamy, rich, and tasty) $9. Lobster bisque is great, too, but there is no lobster chunk.   Passion Fruit crepe soufflés: Rich filling but with fresh taste of passion fruit sauce, a great dessert with generous size to share.  Alcohol: Highly recommend the watermelon basil, brilliant color with brisk mouth-feel.  Complimentary appetizer platter: dry-aged beef, prosciutto, salami with duck liver and honey dip is remarkable and with beautiful presentation.   Complimentary desserts: lollipop cake and brownie, too bad that we were too full to finish them."}
{"text":"Probably the worst run steakhouse I have ever been to. We had a reservation at 8 because I had a client meeting at 10 and we didn't even see our meals until 9:40.  Incredibly poor service, not the fault of the servers at all, but the management needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"The Good: The steak.  The Bad: Crazy prices.  Why charge separately for sides?  The Review: I'm not much for fine dining. I hate paying $60 for a puny dish with some nice presentation and \"umami\" flavor. However, I will dish out some $$$ on a quality steak. I was a bit apprehensive about coming to this place because I was worried we were underdressed (wrestling t-shirt and shorts) but you didn't sense a hint of condescension from any of the staff. I ordered the $60+ bone-in steak w/ marrow. My buddy ordered the same thing, I was a bit disappointed at how much marrow he got compared to mine.  The steak was juicy and the cream spinach was great.  They brought out a few items \"courtesy of the chef\" for us to try. The duck pate w/ crackers was really good, as was the brownie at the end.  My friend opted for the $92 Wagyu steak. It was smaller than our 22oz monsters at 16oz, but you could taste the difference in quality.  However was it really worth $92?  I don't know about that.  I was a bit disappointed that they charged for additional sides, especially after going to a place like House of Prime Rib in SF that just charges you for the cut of meat and everything else is included.  Other than that I'd definitely recommend folks looking for a quality steak to check out BLT Steak."}
{"text":"The BEST banana cream pie ever. The popovers are fabulous and they even give you a recipe! The only thing I could complain about was the coffee - a little weak."}
{"text":"My friend and I were very disappointed with our main meal.  Filet mignon was dry and tasteless, lobster was about two and a half bites worth and overcooked, and the sea bass was the worst I have ever had.  With the prices they charge, every meal should be spot on--no exceptions.  They deducted $36 from the check.  Ok.  Service was good.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and do not plan on going back there."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! Made a reservation over the phone and when we got here they made us wait 20 min before seating us. When we get to our table the two high chairs I had asked for when we made the res. weren't even at our table. Imagine how that went with our two toddlers? Not good! Then we spent another 10 min standing there trying to keep the kids busy while they searched for the chairs. The waiter came back with only one saying they didn't have another. I gave him the idea of borrowing one from next door and luckily we got our two highchairs. After that inconvenience, the service and food were terrible. Both the bone-in ribeye and New York steaks were too tough. Had to send back the New York to have it cooked a little longer b/c our medium was too rare. Don't get the \"hen of the mushrooms.\" They were too bland and the way they cooked them didn't make it appetizing at all. Everything was so bad I did not even order my favorite part of the meal, dessert. Never going back."}
{"text":"Didn't have a steak because our reservations were too late, and had a tummy ache. My husband wanted the 28-day dry aged NY Strip but waitress convinced him to have the Bone-in Strip. He had it with peppercorn sauce and he loved it. When I ordered the shrimp cocktail waitress made a face. That disappointed my husband and wanted to walk out. Other than that enjoyed the popovers and baked potato and the asparagus were amazing!! Loved the VIP platter that they bring to the table to try. Duck liver wasn't too bad. I only wish my wine was chilled when served. Not sure if we'll return but it was an \"OK\" experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here on Saturday, Nov. 25th. We had eaten here once before about a year ago and it was fine so we tried again. We booked the res on Open Table. The overall experience was EXCELLENT! We had a terrific waiter (can't remember his name). We started with cocktails (two Vodka Gimlets)  which were FANTASTIC! Next they bought some starters (pate, etc.) on the house which were a nice touch. We had two salads - the Spinach Salad and the Beet Salad. Both were Excellent (my wife said she had never seen so many Beets in a Beet Salad - she loves Beets, I hate them). Next we shared the Bone-In Rib-Eye. It was huge and the Chef sliced it for us before presenting it. PERFECT! Medium to Medium-Rare! For sides we had sautéed spinach (not on the menu but they can do it) and the Stuffed Mushrooms (they were fine but we were stuffed already so those we didn't finished). During the meal we had a 2014 Pride Vineyards Cabernet (less pricey then Groth and twice as good!). We did not order a dessert. Overall - EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a special occasion. We were seated in a small private section.  Food: I'm impressed by the complimentary liver pate and pop over bread with their own butter. Appetizer: crab cake was the best I've ever had. Pure crab, minimal breading! Ahi Tartare you can't go wrong with Side dish: creamy spinach was ok but the truffled mash was sooo good!!! Main dish: I got the wagyu 6oz. Perfect size for me. Very tasty n juicy. No complaints. My husband got the rib eye with bone marrow. It was huge!!!good but not the best Overall it was a delicious dining. Good place for dinner date or group"}
{"text":"We were very fortunate to take advantage of the groupon deal offered for this restaurant but I must say that even if we paid regular price for our meal it would have been so worth it! We ordered the porterhouse steak for 2 with the creamy mashed potatoes and green beans. Everything was cooked perfectly! Steak needed absolutely no steak sauce whatsoever and the sides were equally delicious! They also offered complimentary  bread that everyone said was awesome as well. I only neglected to try the bread because I wanted to save room for the steak I was craving. Overall very great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Every time we come we get the travel zoo deal. It basically covers almost our entire meal. The staff is friendly and helpful. We have come here a few times now. The first time was great and everything was smooth. The second time our food was apparently taking too long and the chef gave us free drinks and dessert. We had no clue our food was taking too long we never complained. It was amazing how they went above and beyond. One of our favorite places and we always make sure to come here!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the reservation-only Sterling Brunch. My husband's favorite food happens to be from here--truffle mashed potatoes--and this is also probably his favorite place to eat. I was a tad skeptical at first, but if this place is good enough to book 2.5 months ahead of time, they might be on to something. They made sure to get a table with Duff--an incredibly friendly, eye-patch wearing, charismatic gentleman who never let our champagne glasses run dry and kept our tables clean and tidy the entire time we were there.   The food was also great. I have never seen cocktail shrimp all jumbo sized and perfectly peeled, nor have I ever seen such consistency with \"buffet style\" medium rare steak. Every single dish had the quality as if I had ordered the individual entree at a regular restaurant. In fact, the only critique I'd give would be that the sushi was lacking and had way too much rice for the amount of fish, but the fish itself was incredibly fresh.   The desserts are also itty bitty morsels of all kinds of sweets; I saw tiramisu, berry tart, lemon-raspberry tart, etc. Their chocolate strawberries are gigantic and absolutely amazing!  This experience was definitely one I'd go to again, though maybe in a few months/next year, as I ate so much I feel like I don't need to eat again for a long, long while!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with a group of ten.  We had a fantastic meal and the staff was great!  Amazing popovers and the steaks melted in your mouth!"}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars.  Very expensive, even with a groupon that I got for 55.00( used a 20% off promo code) for 100.00 worth of food.    My disclaimer is that I don't eat beef, however everyone else in my party does.  They did let us use 2 groupons( 1 per couple) so that was nice.   My wife and female cousin both ordered filet, medium well.  They enjoyed that a lot.  Both said the steak was perfectly cooked and tender.  Male cousin got a NY strip and he also enjoyed that. In my opinion,  For the price of the steak, they should give you the sauce, not charge an extra 2.00( nickel and dime the customer).  The side dishes were advertised by the server as \" family style\".  Wrong, they are single serving size and pricey at 10.00 each.  My wife and I shared a baked potato, mac n cheese( just ok) and cream spinach.  Cousins had green beans, mashed potatoes( loaded with butter and cream) and baked.     I was NOT a fan of the popovers nor was my wife because we dont like \"eggy\" tastes and those were very eggy tasting.    Speaking of eggs, I got the lobster cobb salad( 23.00).  The hard boiled egg was NOT hard boiled, I can't eat runny yolks and thats what I was served.  I asked for a hard cooked egg and was told they did not have any.  Also asked for croutons and was given stale toasted bread.  The salad had a few chunks of lobster, not that much.I'm not a fan of frisee' or radicchio and the salad was loaded with that.  It was not special and not worth the price.     For desserts we had banana cream pie, that was very good, the best part of the meal.  My cousins had a peanut butter mouse.   It was their 20th anniversary and the restaurant gave them a small amount of champagne, not a free dessert or anything more.   Pretty chintzy.   We skipped the duck pate because we're not fans.     I doubt I'd be back, even with the groupon.  We had to pay an extra 28.00 and then left a 20.00 tip. ( just our portion)"}
{"text":"this is the worst steakhouse I have never eat in my life . Is the first time I did not finished my food.... the meat is tested so wear. for sure it is a 28day dry age steak. I will never never going again. And I strongly suggest dear readers will change their mind of going ..    I order a middim rare.... but this is a blue ...."}
{"text":"I was alone and ate at the bar. The staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly. I'm giving this place only three stars because my food took about 40 mins to get to me...may not seem long but the two other ppl that arrived after me had their food much quicker. Once it did arrive it looked so tasty but I was disappointed. The sauce is what made the dish."}
