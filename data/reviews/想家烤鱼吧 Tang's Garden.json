{"text":"I have tried this place 2 times and both had good experience. As long as you speak up your requirement, for example, less spicy etc. They will make the dishes accordingly. Overall service is very good. Good for family, friends, bigger parties! The veggie in the fish dish is too expensive though."}
{"text":"The service was great. The waitress was very helpful and refilled our drinks often. The Kung Pao chicken sauce was good but the chicken itself was very gummy and texturally kind of gross. I have made chicken in a variety of dishes in a variety of styles and have never gotten chicken to taste like it was made from soggy gummy bears. It was a very odd experience. The flavor of the dish was exceptional but the chicken itself was disgusting.

We also had garlic broccoli which was very good. And we tried their chicken fried rice which was unremarkable and suffered from the same problems as the Kung Pao chicken.

Honestly this restaurant seems to be geared towards Hot Pot fish dishes which is awesome if you like that sort of thing. Unfortunately I went in not knowing that this was their specialty and if I had perhaps I would have gone somewhere else. I'm not a big fish person and I can't do shellfish so their specialty crawfish dish is something I can't even eat.

I would go and try the fish Hot Pot dishes if only to get an example of what the chef is capable of in their specialty dish. But given the fact that I don't love fish dishes this place probably just wasn't for me. The flavors of the sauces was exceptional the quality of the cooking of the vegetables was great.

The chicken in both the dishes that had chicken was very  unappetizing to my palette texturally. I would say go and try this place for yourself... Don't take my word for it this was not a place designed for someone with my palate."}
{"text":"This spot just opened up. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Food was awesome! We split the garlic shredded pork, Szechuan noodles, and Ma-Po tofu. The garlic pork was outstanding. The broth for the noodles was very nice as well. I enjoyed mixing the tofu and noodles. The main dishes come with white rice, and definitely is enough to feed one (I think you can ask for fried rice). My recommendation is to ask for extra napkins before the food comes out. Forks are available upon request as well :)

If you're looking for authentic Chinese, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is our first time eating here.  At first we worried that it is a bit pricey, but the portions are big and the food tastes excellent! Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My rating would've been a 5 Star if the service wasn't so bad. All the food was delicious and steaming hot but i got only my fried rice after 45mins and my ma-po tofu 15 mins later. I waited another 15 mins until I finally got up and asked for my chow mein to go because I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait for it and I'd already filled up on the other dishes.

My waitress comes back about 10 mins later with my chow mein and bill and I got the rest of my food to go as well.

I'm really not ever picky about service in a restaurant unless the waiter is being disrespectful or rude but it was really irritating to wait that long for every single dish especially when you see tables that came in after you with bigger orders and get their food before you.

They did comp my bill 10% which was nice but I really shouldn't have been in there for an hour and a half."}
{"text":"We went there for the second time with friends and were kind of disappointed that the grilled fish didn't taste as well as when we first visited. The crawfish was not fresh so I will not recommend it. Lamb were too chewy for me to enjoy it and was not as good as how other Chinese restaurants that has it. I hesitate if I shall give it another try. I do hope that the taste keeps living up the standards every time we go."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday. The food and the environment are awesome. The restraunt has just opened. So everything is new. I heard the chef is from Los angels and has built good reputation on their authentic boiled fish. We ordered one and it tasted like we had in Sichuan! We also ordered the lamb ribs and rice noodles. Both are very authentic. Definitely will come back. Plus, right now they have 10% off opening promotion."}
{"text":"Umami overload! I've been to several concerts in this exact location years ago, but this place rocks more than ever. Friendly, helpful staff, amazing AUTHENTIC food and great prices. We over ordered out of excitement, but the leftovers were just as good. Glad to have this new staple in the neighborhood! Can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place's Kongpao chicken is the most authentic I've ever found in Phoenix area! We had lamb and noodles as well. All very tasty! Dishes are a bit pricy, but it's all worth."}
{"text":"The Chinese food is really authentic. The only Cons is the Fried Fish Pot does not have anything such as vegetables, Tofu included. Even it charges $26, you still need to pay $3 to $4 for each additional type of food you want to have."}
{"text":"I've came here for a couples of time. Boiled fish was nice but the portions of those add-on food were extremely small. We added potato for $2.99 but only a few slices (3-5) could be found in the pot, 3.99 for beef triple and 3.99 for beef meatball were the same situation (which were literally a FEW slices/ pieces)... was kinda disappointed about the portion.. if those add on was $1-2 each, I wouldn't complain... 

Other than that, everything was good, servers were nice, food tastes pretty authentic. Will come back"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times as I would like to try more food from the same restaurant. Overall, they have good taste on nearly all the dishes they provide, however, it is not hard to notice they are definitely overpriced. Maybe they also have some relatively larger serving size, but when I go there with only 2-3 people, it is hard to make the order. Last time when I go in a group of 3, we spent 70 dollars for a regular meal (just fish and lamb). And when I go with a larger group, we could usually control the price under 18/person. They have no price difference between lunch and dinner.

For their specialty fish dish, I wouldn't recommend you to order anything other than their cheapest option: Fish fillet with No or at most One add-in. Otherwise, you probably would feel not worth the price."}
