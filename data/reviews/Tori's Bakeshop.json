{"text":"So it's the first day Tori's Bakeshop is open, so maybe it's premature to review them... but I can't help it. Yelp must know about a new vegan & gluten free friendly bakery.

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.

Golly I wish this was closer to parkdale/trinity-bellwoods - though odds are, I'll be back really really soon."}
{"text":"Everything tastes like the baker was having a wonderful day when it was made. 
Comfortable, bright and happy. I love this place, 
Also, so many gluten free options!"}
{"text":"Back in March I had a birthday cake done by Tori, and after recently turning vegan I was terrified to have a birthday cake that was going to be vegan. THE CAKE HOWEVER WAS PROBABLY THE BEST CAKE IVE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!! Every time I've come here I am blown away by how beautiful the place is and its food! The food and service here is incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"We are so glad we stumbled across this amazing bakery!

We had ordered a cake for our engagement party from a larger vegan bakery, and were extremely disappointed. For our wedding cake, we knew we needed something better. That's when we stopped by Tori's and found that we loved every flavour we tried. I think I was half in a sugar coma by the time we left. 

They were extremely easy to plan my day with, and everything went off without a hitch. My guests could not believe that the cake was vegan, and my GF friends were glad to have an option for them too. We ordered way too much cake, but it was almost entirely gone by the next day, as we had some family over for lunch and most of them wanted to take some cake home with them. 

I should also mention that the flowers they chose to top the cake(s) with were perfect and the icing job was simple and classy. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I haven't wrote a review in a while...mainly because I haven't tried anything new lately that made me want to write a review. Then along came toris....
First of all, I am a self proclaimed dessert snob. I love my desserts and pastries. When I found out my newborns tummy was sensitive to anything dairy that I was consuming, I was devasted. I had to cut out all dairy from my diet. 

I convinced my husband to drive me to toris since I was craving some sweets. Honestly, when I walked into the bakery I could hear the angels singing. Inside was gorgeous, the staff were friendly and the pastries looked divine!

I ordered the chocolate chip cookie, chocolate croissant, cookies and cream cupcake, chocolate cupcake, vanilla cupcake, and berry cupcake and the Chocolate cheesecake cupcake. 

Chocolate chip cookie - 5/5 - I make pretty bomb chocolate cookies (using butter though) and I got to say these were butter. They were the perfect texture...not too soft..not to crunchy. And the sweetness was spot on!

Chocolate croissant- 5/5 - I have very high standards for chocolate croissants because I've gotten the best from epi breads. I got to say, I did not miss the butter at all
 These were amazing!

The cupcakes - 4.5/5 - best cupcakes ever (even conpared to other cupcakes elsewhere with dairy in them) you must try the berry cupcake...I almost didn't order it..but I'm so happy I did. Incredibly most and flavorful. All the cupcakes were amazing..even the chocolate cheesecake. My least favorite was the vanilla just because I was not fond of the donut on top.

Overall, toris...you blew my mind! I will be back again. For sure by Wednesday lol"}
{"text":"Went to Tori's for the first time the other day to check it out as it just opened. I love the decor of the place and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I even got to talk to Tori the owner and she is just cute as a button and very enthusiastic about the business. They have a wide selection of baked goods and coffee products and I will defiantly be frequenting this shop. I recommend the banana bread... its killer!"}
{"text":"Gosh I miss their almond milk lattes! They always have a super selection of gluten free goodies...always a hit with celiac friends. I live out of the GTA now I miss a stroll up Queen Street to this charming friendly bakeshop, if you are in the area stop in an have a bite you will not regret it But be prepared to pay a little more than Timmies or a commercial shop --quality can cost a bit more so be ready for a tiny bit of sticker shock...but the yummy tastes will push it away quick"}
{"text":"I called in and ordered 6 donuts and 6 cupcakes for pick-up the following day. There was a bit of phone tag going on, but I do give Tori's props in getting back to me and ensuring my order was taken. It was pretty obvious they care about their customers from the phone call alone. 

Picked up my order the next day and everything was waiting for me, packaged nicely. When I placed the order the day before, the girl on the  phone informed me that I would be receiving 2 vanilla cupcakes, 2 pear, and 2 margarita. In reality, I was given 2 tiramisu cupcakes in lieu of the pear. When I mentioned it to the girl at the counter, she exclaimed that someone should have called me to inform me of the change. 

Okay, so I'm not going to mince words here, Tori's is on the pricy side. The donuts are quite small and for the 6 donuts and 6 cupcakes, I paid a hefty sum of just under $50!

As far as taste goes, I will say that the salted double chocolate donuts were divine!! The vanilla donuts were okay and a tad too 'raw dough' tasting for me. The margarita cupcakes were tasty. The tiramisu cupcakes were awful. Great effort but the taste was totally unbalanced, especially the failed attempt at some mocha filling which tasted more of stale carob. 

I'll definitely go back for more of their chocolate donuts, and I'd try out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan baked goods. You might not even notice that the treats are egg- and dairy-free. Love their cinnamon buns and the fact that they toast all the bake goods before serving them. Nothing better than a warm blueberry scone with your coffee. Staff are a delight and the decore is stellar. Love that wallpaper."}
{"text":"Tori's is amazing, my favourite bakery in Toronto! The bakeshop is entirely vegan, and has such a welcoming atmosphere and staff. The only downside to this place is that it's not closer to where I live. It is, however, completely worth the long streetcar ride from downtown! The pizza pockets, savoury scones, and cinnamon buns are my favourites!"}
{"text":"As I cycled by the shop, I was impressed with its pretty exterior. I stopped to have a closer look, hopeful that the interior would be equally charming. The interior of the shop is indeed charming. When you enter you're struck by a feeling of freshness and light. In fact, this is exactly how you would want the baking to taste. However, I don't judge a bakery by its decor. As an experienced baker myself, the proof is in the product. I decided on a blueberry scone and a cup of coffee. I wasn't expecting perfection, but I certainly wasn't prepared for a scone with a rubbery, gelatinous crumb, almost tasteless, except for a few blueberries and some orange zest. No amount of flavouring can salvage poor texture. Scones are covered in Baking 101. Sorry, but I can't recommend."}
{"text":"So good.  A vegan bakeshop that non vegans can enjoy to. Have a savory scone, an tasty donut, or a cinnamon madness bun!  You wont leave unsastisfied on the baked goods."}
{"text":"Best vegan food I have tasted so far. The freshness of all the local and organic ingredients dances on  your tongue asking for more.... This is located on the beautiful Beaches, Toronto... I recommend to take a few good friends for a lovely dinner, share the meal with some good wine and dive into the desserts and you will find yourself in heaven again, especially with the cremebrulee.... The service was Excellent and I am very glad I finally got to try Tori's and recommend everyone to try it out and will never be let down! Love xox"}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods, beautiful space, pleasant staff - I couldn't ask for anything more, except perhaps that the bakeshop would move closer to the subway line. 

My top picks for baked goods are the pizza pocket (not the GF version) and the cinnamon bun.

Tori's After Hours became my go-to special occasion restaurant, and I'll definitely try to go back on my next visit to Toronto.

I'd say that the daytime baked goods are $$ and the After Hours menu is $$$."}
{"text":"Tori ' s is the best! Amazing vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free baked goods. It has a great ambience and super friendly staff. It is very well-priced especially considering the quality of food and drink. We will be back a lot. A lot."}
{"text":"I have visited Tori's Bakeshop on several occasions and have noticed a lack of consistency. I mainly go there for their baked goods and have been disappointed for a couple reasons.

Firstly, the baked goods are often very greasy, namely the scones and the cookies. On two occasions I purchased the gluten free blueberry lemon scones and found the oil soaking through the box. I was left with grease on my hands after touching them. It was disgusting.

On my last visit I purchased breakfast cookies and again they were extremely oily and actually completely raw in the center. This is a basic cookie we are talking about and even that was not made correctly. If you are a bakery and you offer the same baked goods every day, learn to get it right. There should not be so many inconsistencies and errors that can be easily avoided.

Considering that the baked goods are so expensive the quality should be on par with that and unfortunately that is a rare occurrence here.

I will say that the coffee is delicious, but that is roasted elsewhere. The atmosphere is very inviting, however there is a definite lack of seating. The service for the most part is very good.

I have given Tori's Bakeshop many chances (a few too many) and now I am sorry to say that I have given up on them and I will not return."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Beach!  

Located on the less busy, more chilled out eastern end of the Beaches, their clean, fresh storefront first caught my attention.  I was happily welcomed inside by their bright and airy interior that has you feeling like lingering for a while.  The selection (and prices), though limited, is what you'd expect for a small bakery with a natural, organic and gluten-free focus.  It seems that all things made in-house and not delivered in from elsewhere.

I tried a few g-free options and must say that the donut was delicious, and love that their lattés are made with soy! Tori's Bakery staff were extremely friendly and chatty. It was definitely hard to believe that it's only be open a few days, the bakery was packed full!  I look forward to coming back here again - with friends, with my young daughter or solo!  Welcome and see you again soon :)"}
{"text":"Cute little vegan and gluten free spot.  The food was yummy and the staff are super friendly.  I enjoyed a tempeh tuna sandwich with a Scottish camel toffee tea w/coconut milk as per recommend by the lovely cashier.  I also indulged in a chocolate donut and a vanilla cup w/ a mini donut on top....It looked irresistible!!   All in all I wish I lived around the corner because this was a great experience and even better for the locals, it seemed like the staff took the time to remember the regulars....not saying I didn't feel like a local for the time but I would love to be one of their regulars lol"}
{"text":"I just went to Tori's for the first time today after a friend had told me about it. Having lived in the beaches for a while, this is something that I wished was out there while I was there. It's about time the quaint, animal-loving community got a totally vegan shop like this!

Now that I live downtown, it took me a good 45 minutes to get there, but it was worth the trip. I give it 5 stars because everything that I ate tasted new and different to my vegan palate. Most of the items I tried were gluten-free, and everything was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to show this place off to my non-vegan friends!

Favorite item: The BLT. It seems most of the reviewers on here went back when it first opened and the shop didn't have sandwiches yet, but now, vegan/gluten-free-sandwich hunters, they do. I'm one of those vegans who doesn't like fake meat, namely vegan bacon because it tastes waaay too much like real bacon to me. But the \"B\" on the BLT is hickory-smoked coconut, which is something I can't wait to tell my chef roommate about. Combined with a bit of veganaise, the L and T, and the most delicious and fresh homemade SPELT bread, this sandwich was absolutely heavenly. 

I also bought the chocolate chunk cookie, corn bread, cheese biscuit and the coffee cupcake, and planned on sharing all of this with my friends, but this stuff is so delicious I think my friends will have to wait until next time I head there!

Everything I got, including an earl grey tea latte, cost $26.95. Might sound steep for someone headed to Loblaw's for the same few items, but given the cost of organic, gluten-free and overall better quality ingredients, I feel the price is absolutely fair. Also, if you bought all of these treats and a latte at Starbuck's or at an Artisan, non-vegan, non-gluten free bake shop, I'm sure the price would come close."}
{"text":"A wonderfully friendly, playground of sinful, vegan goodies. This may be the reason I have only gained weight since eating more vegan options. Cinnamon buns, donuts and apple pie...oh my."}
{"text":"I admit, I am not a vegan...nor am I gluten free so I'm often sceptical about just how tasty a cake like this could be.

The answer - out of this world!!!  We got a rocky road cake with chocolate icing for our vegan and gluten free co-worker.  Hands down one of the best cakes we've ever had.  Absolutely delicious and beautifully decorated.

Staff were very helpful and friendly helping us get our order just right.

10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Tori's Bakeshop after a recommendation by my sister and I was not disappointed! I ordered the smoked hickory coconut BLT and although I was a bit skeptical about how smoked coconut was going to taste the sandwich was surprisingly delicious! The bread was soft and chewy and the veggies very fresh. I also had a vanilla cupcake topped with a little donut which was very nice as well. I'm not a vegan but do occasionally like trying vegan cafes and restaurants around the city and I would highly recommend Tori's to both my vegan and omnivore friends - the food is just that tasty!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere... for a vegan place :)  I've eaten at almost every vegan place in the city and this will be your go to vegan cafe and bakery in the east end (I like TBC on the West side).

Start with a scone and get some earth balance on the side your first time here for breakfast.  Or just go crazy with a fancy grilled cheese using Daiya and maybe some pears.

Coffee:  Great, they were using Sam James when I wrote this (so they know their espresso).  I suggest a coconut/almond mix for the milk, they've found the perfect barista grade almond milk for microbubbles, or soy if you like it sweeter.  

Things that rule here
- cupcakes
- scones with earth balance
- great milk alternatives in the coffee
- you, you will rule when you eat these"}
{"text":"Best bakery in Toronto, hands down. I've brought many non-vegans here and they were all amazed with the food. Not only are they vegan, but they also don't use junk in their baking like some other vegan places - their donuts are delicious, and not deep fried dough that makes you feel awful. My absolute favorite things are the cinnamon buns here. They are huge and amazing (so they sell out fast!). I've tried other vegan bakeries and there just isn't any comparison. The after hours is also out of this world amazing, with seasonal offerings and a menu that changes at least slightly quite often. Last time I went here for dinner I had ice cream cake for dessert, which made my year."}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love, love Tori's!

They offer delicious cookies, sandwiches, cupcakes, cinnamon buns, pizza pockets, and other goodies, along and a huge variety of drinks (coffee, tea, and more). Everything is absolutely awesome. And, as a vegan, I've been so happy to see how diligent they are about offering exclusively plant-based foods.

The shop is also super cute, and the staff are really fun and friendly. And it's just a short walk from the beach!

If you're looking for a welcoming, comfortable place to enjoy an awesome assortment of super tasty vegan treats, look no further. Tori's is the best place in the city!"}
{"text":"Went back for a second round because I had read the \"outstanding\" reviews here on yelp. 

Still did not find that there was anything to write home about. The coffee was not very good, and the baked goods were bland, at best.

Cool decor and nice to look at. The staff are nice. But I would not go back..."}
{"text":"Today I had an opportunity to final visit this shop. It's so cute! The staff is very nice, so many goodies to choose from, lots of gluten free options. I had an almond milk latte with a chocolate salted gluten free donut and a blueberry gluten free scone. Deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Had a small coffee and a day-old spelt chocolate cookie to go. Shop was very cute and smelled heavenly from the spices (\"We're prepping for tomorrow!\"). Cookie was still chewy and delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place blows me away every time I go. Definitely the best vegan shop of its kind that I've been to!

The menu is continually expanding in really diverse and interesting ways. The just started making amazing vegan pizza pockets! And the food is all just as good (or better) than it looks.

In the spring/summer, there aren't a lot of other things I'd rather do than stop by Tori's and then walk around the Beaches!"}
{"text":"The gluten free donuts are ridiculously good and rival any cake donut i'v ever eaten. The donut with pink icing was yummy too. I've only just discovered Tori's and I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Banana bread yum, scones yum etc etc"}
{"text":"Got cupcakes - strawberry lemonade, peaches and cream, vanilla on vanilla and vanilla with choc icing. Loved, loved, loved them all - the right amount of sweetness, and perfect balance of density and moisture. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I went to Tori's last week as I happened to be in the Beaches.
After scanning the prices of all of the items, I chose the cinnamon  bun because for the size, everyone could share a piece, and not go into sugar shock. 
I paid almost $10 for americano and a cinnamon roll. Seriously? $4.50 for a dessert? Just because it's vegan, doesn't mean we should be paying so much for our desserts. I know that I'm not returning as the prices are not very inviting when not a single person with a huge disposable income."}
{"text":"A friend of mine mentioned this bake shop and I decided to scope it out one day. I was impressed with the quaintness and the brightness of the place. The menu is carefully and beautifully done and the selections are placed out with signage indicating what is what. I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk and I loved the heart design that was made out of the foam, cute. I also grabbed one of their super cookies and I thought it was pretty tasty. The next time I went to Toris' with family I decided to try their banana bread and boy was I impressed! I would definitely recommend the place for people to try and to walk along he strip of the beach is a bonus as well! The big selling point for me was the fact that it is vegan and natural, so amazing!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Those below who say that it's really only good for vegans are either used to crappy baked goods or somehow came on an off-day.

My guest and I are from NYC, and were in search of awesome vegan food in Toronto. Tori's exceeded our expectations! The sandwiches were just very good, while the bread was great, but the baked goods were INCREDIBLE. We've never had anything quite this expertly done, even in NYC.

The cinnamon bun was AMAZING (my guest said 100 times better than Cinnabon, which I've never tried). The blueberry, lemon scone was AMAZING. The butter tart was INCREDIBLE. Tasted like real butter, for sure. The cheddar biscuit, was expertly done, though the vegan cheese used was not my fave, but VERY good. The chocolate hazelnut biscotti was delicious, though more like a baked good than a traditional hard biscotti that needs dipping to not hurt your gums lol. The espresso machiatto was a delicious accompaniment. (And to clarify, 3 of these items were taken to go and eaten later. We didn't eat everything at once, though if our stomachs allowed it we would have.)

Also, given the quality, the prices were very reasonable. In NYC it would have been more expensive, without question."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I wish I could give them a bonus star for how fantastic this place is. The BEST vegan cupcakes I've ever had. Beautiful decor, super friendly service, really helpful and knowledgeable staff. And, despite being so popular, is a great place to relax with a latte, a snack and a good book."}
{"text":"I actually used to love this place, but last 3 or 4 times that I have been in I have been disappointed. Nothing is as good as it used to be. The brownies used to be to die for but now I wouldn't even order one. 

The cupcakes are good if I happen to be in the neighborhood, but that is about all I would order at this point."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, great food but coffee could be better. 
I tried the eggplant pizza pocket and was floored at how good the gooey pastry was. Also ordered my bday cake from them, wasn't cheap but was delicious! 
The coconut lavender tea latte was watery and so was the cappuccino with coconut milk. Maybe they can start using actual cooking coconut milk vs the very bland carton ones."}
{"text":"Although going here is a complete mission coming all the way from the west end, I'm in love and wish I lived in the area to more often.
On my first trip I decided since the long travel I would splurge a bit. I got the BLT sandwich, a cinnamon roll, and a donut. The BLT was delicious, loved the coconut bacon. The cinnamon roll was not to my liking, but the donut was probably the best vegan donut I've ever had. 
On my second trip I bought four of their pizza pockets which was a relatively new item. Bought a bunch to keep at home to heat up when hungry. The Hawaiian and the spicy sausage were amazing, loved! The tofu and rapini was not all that likable but I do not like rapini that much to begin with so to each their own.
Although pricey, I like to go in one in awhile and splurge, in the end it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'm lactose-intolerant and it's so nice to go into a place and know that I can have anything in there that my little heart desires! Beleive me, it's a rare thing! Most places don't understand or simply don't know what ingredients are used in their baking. But here, you can be sure they'll know. AND you can be sure it'll be good! My favourites are the breakfast cookies and the various scones. De-lish! A little bit pricey, but a very nice treat."}
{"text":"I'm neither vegan nor lactose intolerant but I love this place! Cheerful, sunny interior; cheerful, sunny, well-trained baristas. Chocolate biscotti are dense, dark chocolate, more compacted brownies than biscotti. Chocolate cupcakes are moist and decadent. Since I'm a chocoholic, I can't get past their chocolate confectioneries but their other desserts look delicious. Cappuccinos are made with soy milk so they have some of the soy aftertaste but because the staff uses a double shot of good espresso and doesn't overdo the milk, they are still tasty. Perhaps it is expensive but you pay for quality."}
{"text":"Tori's Bakeshop has made two very unique birthday cakes for our house and both were amazing. Mine was gluten-free, large enough to host 40 people + leftovers, and beautifully decorated even though they don't advertise as cake decorators. 

His was a delicious stack of maple cakes to look like a stack of pancakes for a Sunday afternoon birthday brunch. 

Not to mention their regular selection of treats are flavourful and tasty, especially the gluten-free fare which is really hard to come by. 

My final favourite, their Pumpkin Pour in the fall! Real pumpkin puree in either tea lattes or coffee. They are so delicious I just wish the cup was bigger so it would last longer. 

Not to mention, the interior is really cute and comfortable to hang out for a little bit. There are always a few people sitting there, either working or chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place. Inside, it's quaint and comfortable. A great place to meet a friend for lunch or coffee. The menu is vegan and even this carnivore has enjoyed the lunch items! Now for the baked goods...., personally I absolutely LOVE the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, the cinnamon rolls, and they do their own Easter Creme Egg that is TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"I have bought a variety of muffins and cupcakes at Tori's Bake Shop.

The muffins are surprisingly good esp for gluten-free. All are substantial. The massive bran muffin I like very much, it's not GF but flavorful with raisin (or currant?) and bold molasses.

The cupcakes I got for a friend were a bit fussy and the flavors were so-so, the texture not too 'sawdusty' so better than expected, but overall unrewarding. I may try a few more next time I bring some treats over.

I will def try the choco donuts. The oat cookies were meltingly fantastic.

Hard to imagine dropping less than the required +/- $4 an item here, given the overheads of the nice space and the staff and good ingredients. You get what you pay for. I hope Tori's in the Beach will do well here for a very long time, and suggest dropping by to see if there's anything you like."}
{"text":"Very grateful to have this place close to where I live! 
The food is fantastic , this is my type of restaurant: organic food, gluten free options , fresh , delicious ...
The staff is great , courteous and friendly
Thankful"}
{"text":"I took a colleague from England here yesterday during a tour of the Beaches and she was wowed by the vegan BLT. The best part is they now sell the smoked coconut that proxies for bacon -- bottled coconut chips made out the back, dipped in olive oil,tamari and of course maple syrup and smoked over hickory wood. This is a message in a bottle -- we can take steps to solve deforestation caused by the drive for cheep livestock feed  and heart disease caused by excess saturated fat, and enjoy a great sandwich.
I also like that this is a \"niche\" business. As I argue in my book Food for City Building, many food companies occupy a niche -- like the hundreds of bugs and birds in a forest, each part  of a nice complements but does not compete with beings that fill other niches. Full service restaurants serving bacon from pigs have nothing to worry about from Tori's; Tpri is bringing more new people to the Beaches and everyone benefits, including the people who walk around, instead of sitting around watching the tube. We can arrange an economy where, within reason, everyone wins. 
That's as sweet a thought as Tori's cupcakes."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? I couldn't find anything wrong with this place.

The decor, as mentioned by many others, is gorgeous, warm and welcoming. Both counter staff greeted us with a friendly \"hello\".

My wife and I each had a (non gf) savoury scone (mine broccoli and cheddar, hers mushroom and something else), both of which were delicious. 

When I see an Elektra espresso machine, I can't resist, so both my wife and I had a flat white (hers decaf, mine caf), and they were also very good. I drink a lot of espresso and milk based hot beverages (coffee list here http://www.yelp.com/list/coffee-toronto-2), but wouldn't have known that these were made with soy milk if I hadn't read it on the chalk board after the fact. They get their beans from Merchants of Green Coffee. http://www.yelp.com/biz/merchants-of-green-coffee-toronto

Great ambiance, great products. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Tori's. Everything is made fresh, nothing from frozen, all natural ingredients and so so so tasty. She offers vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free options. (including GF donuts!) and their Ba'con' is to die for (it's a smoked coconut that replaces your need for bacon) 

Take out or dine-in, spend an hour people watching on their patio or reading a book. The staff is always friendly and helpful and I love that their super active on social media so you can tweet, facebook or instagram them with questions."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  We need more vegan places in the east end!  

The decor is lovely.  Fresh and clean and comfortable.  

The staff were friendly, professional, helpful, efficient.

The latte was hot and frothy and the espresso had a lovely aroma/flavour.

The baked goods are where this place fell short.  The cupcake (cookies and cream) was dry; the icing too sweet.  The brownie was also a bit on the dry side, with waaaay too much icing on top.  I had to scrape off about half of it and I have quite the sweet tooth.  The donut was ok - not like a regular coffee shop donut, but good nonetheless.  The cinnamon bun was the best of the bunch, but again, a little too sweet.  I make better ones at home (also vegan).

I'm going to give this place another chance - I WANT them to succeed - and I've heard that their biscuits are to die for.  We went later in the day, so I'm hoping the items we bought were just a little stale from sitting out all day (not that that should be acceptable either, but if they were freshly baked, we'd have bigger problems).  

Tori & Co has the right idea, just not executed 100%.  Please don't read this review and decide against checking it out for yourself - I just wanted to post the truth and hope that Tori sees this and makes some improvements."}
{"text":"Came back to try the after hours menu. 

We actually just had dinner in the area and decided to stop in for a drink before heading home. I ordered the calamity jane and dave ordered something with kraken in it (spelling?) My drink was delicious!! It had like a fresh citrus taste, perfect for summer. 
We shared the cheese slab. Holy vegan! this was absolutely the best cheese board I've ever tasted. They are cashew based. We tried the smoked, brie and  another (sorry don't remember). It was served with crackers, pecans, fruit preserve, pumpkin seeds. 

It was the perfect end to date night."}
{"text":"This bakery is truly something special, the way there desserts are made I would have not  guessed that they were fully vegan having being one, what I recommend trying are the following: ice cream sandwich, fudge brownie, banana bread, veggie tea biscuit  (was to die for) and they're cookies. The only complaint that I have to make is that by the time me and my family had got there there wasn't much of a selection to pick from so we didn't get to try the things that we wanted to. Overall I would definitely come to this bakery again, it was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Tori's! 

I've recently cut out gluten and dairy and I have to say I miss them. I'm tired of eating dry, dense, gritty baked goods. Tori's bakeshop offers a myriad of treats for GF and vegan eaters. 

The cheese (vegan) and chive biscuit was to die for. It had a lovely moist crumb, was perfectly seasoned and had a nice buttery flavour. I think I'm going to have to buy them by the dozen. 

The GF donuts were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"The donuts were extremely expensive and tasted like frosted cardboard. They were awful. We also had a pretzel and something else and it was all just not very good. Maybe you have to be a gluten free vegan to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Heard about Tori's from a vegan baking friend in Calgary, had to check it out. So glad we did! Savoury muffins and sweet cupcakes were delightful. The choc caramel brownies were my favourite - not too rich but filling enough that I didn't need 5 for my sugar fix. 

Really cute presentation inside and outside the shop, friendly helpful staff and affordable prices. 

Going back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Just tried the oreo chocolate cupcake. How does she do it? It was one of the best cakes I've ever had, moist, chocolaty and sweet -- and all vegan? I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"After visiting the Bluff's for our engagement photo session this morning, our photographer suggested popping over to Tori's for coffee and cinnamon buns. Although it was a bit out of the way, we were told the baked goods were to die for. 

I ordered the cinnamon bun while my partner ordered the smoked hickory coconut BLT. I can't put into words how delicious the cinnamon bun was. When I was told it was completely vegan, I was astonished. Despite wanting to try my partner's sandwich for myself, he'd already wolfed it down before I could even ask. It was just that good.

The shop itself seems like it was made for Instagram. Cute lighting (mason jar chandeliers and some that look like whisks). The exterior mint-coloured paint even matched their retro espresso machine. Overall, it was quaint, clean, and fresh.

Although there isn't much seating, there was a constant turnover of tables so it wasn't ever too long to wait for one. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good place in town for vegan pizza pockets and cup cakes. Friendly staff , cozy seating , everything you want on a weekend. Can't believe someone can make such good cupcakes without adding any dairy to it."}
{"text":"Contrary to all the positive reviews here. I would like to give this place the lowest rating allowed by Yelp. The good reviews can be attributed to the special dietary restrictions that this place offers i.e. dairy free etc. but the way items are stored here I would suggest people stay away. 
The desserts though look good in the display area were surrounded by bugs/fruit flies and even though we pointed it out to the sales person there was disdain and so what attitude! seriously I am OK with gluten free/dairy free or whatever else the tree huggers, hipsters are into these days but I don't want my proteins from bugs! At least not till its absolutely necessary.
I am sure their fans will keep them busy but I will not be back.
Coffee drinks we tried were OK."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The cheese plate was DELICIOUS!  Especially that brie.  Wow!  We also had a pizza which was quite lovely.  So much on the menu that I wanted to try!  I forget the cocktails we had but they were lovely, also not the type to skimp on alcohol :)
A bit of a trek for those of us living over in the north-west side of the city.  If it was closer, I'd probably be there every day.
Such a cute, quaint place too. :)
Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite vegan bakery on the lower half of Toronto. Everything we had was good and the staff was friendly. Wasn't the best vegan sweets I've had in Toronto but they were still VERY good! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest coffee shops in the beaches. The setup with the booths by the windowsill is very quaint, the baked goods are absolutely delicious and perfect size! Coffee is very good. Overall, definitely worth checking out. Service is always friendly and coffee is quite good."}
{"text":"I came to Tori's bakeshop with some friends and it was packed. The seating is first come first serve, which makes it slightly difficult with a large group. However, I used my awesome negotiation skills to ask a table of two if they could switch tables with my two friends so we could have their table that would fit up to 5 people. 

Once we all were seated we began to place our orders. To order you walk up to the bakery, wait in line and decide which goodies you would like to try. 

All of my friends said their lunches and/or desserts were fantastic!  Two of my friends had the item that looked like a pizza and they both said it was great! Another friend had a muffin and latte and she said it was really good too!

I ordered the cauliflower soup of the day and it was really good. I found it a little bit salty but the crackers that came with it were to die for. I also purchased a mocha latte and 6 desserts to take home and freeze. Well, one was for that evening. All of the baked goods at Tori's are vegan (lactose free).  In addition to this splendid news, half of the baked goods featured in the counter were also gluten free. This literally put me into dessert heaven. 

The cupcake that I tried the first night was a chocolate chip cupcake. The frosting tasted just like cookie dough batter. It was amazing! The cupcake was slightly dry but that could be because I left it in the fridge until the evening. 

The other desserts that I purchased (all from the gluten free selection) included a vanilla donut, a chocolate donut with sea salt, a chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top and lots of frosting, a lemon cupcake and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I wrapped all of these individually and froze them for later consumption. 

After trying all the desserts over the course of a month, here are my reviews:

April 5: I tried the chocolate donut and it was the best donut I have had since discovering I'm gluten and lactose intolerant.  I highly recommend this donut!

April 14: I tried the lemon cupcake and it was really good. It wasn't as good as the chocolate donut but it was really nice. The lemon flavour was fantastic but I found the cupcake a bit sweet for the lemon flavour. If it was less sweet, I may have liked it more. 

April 18: I tried the chocolate cupcake with the donut on top. The cupcake was just average (nothing special) but the mini donut on top was to die for. It reminded me how delicious their donuts are and that I'll have to go back and buy more to freeze once I try all of my goodies. 

April 29:  I just tried the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and I really wasn't impressed. The cookie either had this awful taste or it was too sweet. I want to say the dough wasn't blended evenly during preparation and the oatmeal or whatever \"flour\" they used just had a horrible flavour. I definitely won't be buying this cookie again.

May 1: I tried the white donut with pink frosting. It was okay but the chocolate donut was much better. The donut had that weird flavour that the cookie had. It was really sweet during some bites and and not so great with others. 

The Verdict
I will definitely go back to purchase Tori's gluten free chocolate donut and the chocolate chip cupcake (the frosting was out of this world). My third choice would be the chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top.

 Would I return to Tori's bakeshop?
Definitely!  I might go to buy desserts for my birthday or some other event. I'm not sure I would plan an event there since seating is first come first serve and it's a little out of the way. Allover I am very happy I discovered Tori's Bakeshop."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and the reason for their rating is simple: it's extremely expensive! While the place looks really awesome, the staff is friendly, I can't really recommend it to anyone who isn't a vegan. I tried several different things and for my taste buds everything seemed to taste quite bland. Seeing the other reviews makes me believe that the food does taste good for those who are vegan, but still... the price? Just crazy in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Clean, cozy, and smells AMAZING.  Indulge in your guilty pleasures without the guilt and cruelty of consuming any dairy or eggs.

The staff is extremely friendly, and it's entertaining watching the bakers come out of the kitchen with each freshly baked tray of vegan goodness.

Cupcakes, pies, cinnamon buns (to die for), donuts, scones, and so much more.  They also serve coffee, expressos, lattes, tea, hot chocolate and other drinks to help wash down the sweetness.

The prices are very affordable, which leaves you tempted to try just one more treat.

If you visit The Beach area of Toronto, make sure you visit Tori's Bakeshop.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for delicious gluten free baked goods. Since they can often be very challenging to make, I'm always impressed when a gluten free version that isn't chalked full of sugar is found. That said, I decided to try the gluten free butter tart and had to give the Homer Simpson donut a go. I will preface that I'm not a big donut fan in general. I would say if you like a cake like donut, you would probably enjoy this one. It wasn't a fav for me. The butter tart was also a little disappointing. I was expecting the centre to be gooey and runny - didn't happen. It was rather dry. What I did like was it wasn't over sweetened. 
I will say the staff were friendly and inviting and the place is very nicely decorated and clean. 
I'll end with saying I'm usually a cookie fan, so I'll still have to give one or two of theirs a go at some point and see if that shifts my overall rating."}
{"text":"You will definitely catch me here again. It's a super cute bake shop/coffee shop that's all vegan. I had the chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top and the mocha latte. The cupcake was really good and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. The mocha latte was like any average café. I would come back to try their \"B\".L.T as it sounds delicious. Add this place to your list if you love taking food pictures. It definitely has the aesthetics."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Tori's from a few vegan folks I know so decided to try it out with friends one Saturday afternoon.  First off, there really isn't much seating so luckily one of us got there early and waited until one of the two booths at the front became available.  The server was a bit off about her sitting there on her own while waiting for us and questioned if she was going to order something which wasn't very welcoming.

We ordered a few of the cupcakes which were truly delicious!  I can see why their baked goods are so popular.  I was hungry so also ordered one of their grilled vegetable sandwiches.  While it tasted good, I really don't know how the high price was justified.  It is after all just vegetables!  I'm in the process of trying to reduce the amount of animal based products I consume but lots of vegan/organic restaurants/coffee shops are just so expensive that I find it hard to stick with it.  

Their drink selection is good but as they don't serve milk, drinking tea with soy takes a little getting used to.  I would visit this cafe again and stock up on those amazing cupcakes!"}
{"text":"A beautiful little bakeshop. I just wish it wasn't so far from my house! Toronto is so lucky to have all these vegan and natural bakeries popping up. Tori's isn't obviously a vegan bakery. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the people who go there haven't a clue that these baked goods are vegan and in some cases, gluten-free. 

I love what they've done with this place. The decor is adorable! The industrial whisk lighting reminds me of Vincent Price's bakery in Edward Scissorhands, except much, much cuter. There's a little staircase in the back leading to a bar seating area with windows to the bakery at the back, so you can peak in on treats being made.

When I visited Tori's, late on a Sunday there was a small line-up inside of folks clamouring for goodies and espresso. They have a shiny new Elektra machine. Many bakery items were sold-out but I still managed to get a caramel-filled chocolate, donut holes, a homemade 'Oh Henry' bar and a spelt chocolate-chuck cookie. 

It was all delicious, but the caramel chocolate really stood out. I'm hooked! 

I spoke with Tori and she was super friendly and nice. I wish her the best with this bakery and regret she did not open it in West Toronto. The Beach is practically Scarberia for me, but I will definitely go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"After hearing a seemingly endless amount of good things, I made the trip to Tori's Bakeshop this past weekend to indulge my sweet tooth.

The vibe in the bakeshop is super relaxed and cute.  I could definitely see myself whiling away the hours with a good book, coffee, and a delicious treat in the softly lit and cozy bakery.

I admit, I got so excited and overwhelmed by delicious looking choices that I forgot to double-check that the treat I purchased was gluten free!  That being said, I'm not celiac and my GF lifestyle is by choice, so even if it was wheat-based I wasn't about to die from enjoying one of the cutest cupcakes I have ever seen.  A mini Simpsons-esque doughnut on top of a cupcake!  You're killing me with cuteness, Tori!

All parts of the cupcake were delicious!  The icing was soft and fluffy, and the cake was moist and flavourful without being overpoweringly sweet.  I didn't feel overstuffed or bloated after enjoying this treat, and that's a big plus for me.  You know when you eat a really rich dessert and you get the \"sugar sweats.\"  No sugar sweats for me.  Just satisfaction.

Tori's is a bit of a hike, but I will definitely be back when my sweet tooth is begging for attention."}
{"text":"Some of the best scones I've ever had, and their fresh spelt bread is unreal.  I really like their Americano's as well.  I haven't tried the cupcakes yet.  The staff is quite friendly and are quite knowledgeable about everything there.  Tori even makes them go vegan for a week or so prior to starting just so they know what it's like and get used to the food. 

Their Ba'con is a tasty substitute to the real thing (It's hickory smoked coconut), and I use it as a garnish on my salads all the time. 

Highly recommended if you're in the beaches."}
{"text":"The presentation of each cupcake is eye grabbing. Especially those cupcakes with the little doughnut on top. How could I resist a little doughnut on top of a cupcake, I cant!

Once you get past the presentation, the cupcake failed to wow me further. It's important to remember that these are vegan and/or gluten free cupcakes so they do not have the same consistency of other cupcakes that are made with eggs, etc.

For a vegan cupcake I would give it a four star but the price just drove it down to a three star.

My final thought, it's a bit to pricey for a cupcake eater who isn't vegan but I do think a vegan or someone who eats gluten free food would argue differently."}
{"text":"Finally went to check this place out as it is in my neck of the woods! I ordered a cinnamon bun, focaccia potato bread and a peppermint hot chocolate. I got them heated up and both goods were delectable. Great atmosphere with beautiful natural lighting at the front of the cafe, perfect for you instgram foodies!! Only wish would be to have more seating! The staff were very kind and accommodating to me and my indecisive friend, we are definitely going to go back there soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy banana chocolate chip muffin for breakfast ...made my day! It wasn't dry yet not overly dense. The corn muffin was good too- had little peppers(?) in it- I would have liked that for lunch."}
{"text":"Most of these reviews have to be made by friends and family because Tori's donuts are TERRIBLE!   Grocery store bought donuts that are several days old would taste better.   They had to be made in advance and frozen, re-thawed to taste this poorly.  Even Tim's frozen donuts taste better.  Harsh but true.  Awful food."}
{"text":"We had a friend coming over for dinner that is vegan and since her birthday had also been the day before, I decided to drive over to Tori's and get us some cupcakes to celebrate with. I'd passed by this quaint little cafe a few times while walking down the beaches area but had never gone inside. I went in with a stroller and though it was a little bit tight for us, the staff was all super nice and helped me get inside as well as helped me out as I was leaving. Now for the food...all I can say is...O-M-G. I was skeptical about a vegan BLT, however, it was absolutely scrumptious. The bread was soft and oh so fresh and you would never know that it is 100% vegan. The ba'con? I was picking off any bits that were falling into my lap because they were just that good! Later on that night we had the cupcakes and let me tell you...they were to die for. I don't think I've ever tasted a cupcake that great or frosting that delicious. Worth every penny. Not to mention I got a free cookie to go with my sandwich and I just cannot believe how great this place makes vegan food taste! Their coffee is amazing too. I never drink mine black, but I did from here and it was fabulous. I highly recommend this place, even if you are a conventional eater."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery in Toronto! Although I am not a vegan myself I come here regularly because of good service, freshness and the variety of sweet and savoury options. My favourite treat is a cinnamon bun - they are huge with delicious and creamy frosting. I also enjoy the cookies, scones and brownies. Savoury (broccoli and cheddar) scone is to die for. Try to get there in the morning if you can as it gets very busy, especially on weekends. 

I have also ordered a cake for a special occasion from here and it was a crowd pleaser! Friends and family actually had no idea the cake was vegan until I told them afterwards. It's a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for and Tori's is well worth it."}
{"text":"I could eat the cinnamon bun all day. I can't believe it's not so much butter. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place in the city. I'm obsessed. The coffee, baked goods and oh my god, everything about the after hours portion. The gnocchi. The cheese plate. The veggie plate. Those little cheezy cracker things. Help me. The cocktails, don't even get me started. I can't say I understand their descriptions on the menu but whatever, they're amazing. I bring friends here quite often when I want to make sure that they get a stellar impression of vegan food."}
{"text":"Who knew organic, gluten free, vegan food could taste oh so delicious? Now don't get me wrong, I'm a die hard carnivore that also loves her carbs; but I'm also a foodie adventurer who is willing try anything once. 

Tori's Bakeshop had great reviews, high ratings AND is located in the picturesque Beaches neighborhood. What clinched it for me was watching Tori's video on her website (http://torisbakeshop.ca/about.html); the passion she and her staff share about food and the business is amazing!

Such an adorable eatery with flowerboxes out front, two comfortable tables with a bay window, tables for twosies along the wall and a small loft where you can people watch.

All the desserts look tempting and the food
very appealing. My friend and I chose the following:

- \"B\"LT sandwich with hickory smoked \"bacon\" (coconut flakes), lettuce, tomato and house mayo on organic whole grain bread. Great flavor!
- Falafel + grilled veggie sandwich with an herbed chickpea falafel, grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini on an organic flat bread. Good but I liked the BLT better.
- Cruffin which is croissant dough rolled in butter and sugar baked in a muffin tin, filled with decadent chocolate fudge and topped with cream cheese frosting. It tastes as good as it sounds: easily my favorite dessert of the day! 
- One regular and one gluten free cookies and cream cupcake. There is a difference in taste and texture if you try them side by side but they both would satisfy a sweet tooth. When it comes down to taste, I definitely preferred the regular cupcake; however, the gluten free cupcake was just as moist and light as the regular one. 
- Cinnamon roll - it was ok,  pretty big in size.

It's good to know that eating healthy can still be very tasty."}
{"text":"Scones = amazing.

I ordered half-dozen scones for an omnivore (i.e. no one was vegan/gluten free) ladies brunch and the scones (blueberry lemon flavour) were to die for. Everyone raved. Not too flakey, not too buttery, soft & crunchy combination in all the right places. (Note - I didn't get the gluten free version... just regular). Yay for Tori's! I'll be back for my brunching needs."}
{"text":"I visited Tori's Bakeshop last weekend. I wanted a drink, a sweet snack and a glimpse of their much raved-about Vegan baked goods selection. They didn't have much left early in the early evening when I got there, save for a few cupcakes and cookies. 

I had the very last 'cookies and cream' cupcake and a cup of chai tea. The cupcake was glorious, and though it may not be a compliment, it definitely didn't taste vegan in the assumed pseudo-cream way. The 'oreo' was much more delicious than the ubiquitous every-man cookie. 

The chai tea may have been made in shop or locally outsourced, but either way, it was delicious though a little over-priced even as far as organic chai goes. Though, I wouldn't think twice about returning for a cupcake and tea with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed dinner at Tori's After Hours on a Saturday evening. We shared the olives, the butternut squash gnocchi in a butter sage sauce and the margherita pizza with caramelized onions added... and a nice bottle of syrah as well. Everything was delicious! And the ambience was exactly what you'd want in a wine bar. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"In 2016, I would've given Tori's 5 stars -- the paté with sauerkraut sandwich was delicious and had lettuce, pickle, sauerkraut, mustard and plenty of paté. this year, we had our latest sandwich and there was no pickle, the mustard was so skimpy that I wasn't sure if it was really there, and the dry-ish bread made up the bulk of the sandwich instead of the filling.
the croque last summer every time was exceptional with melt-in-your-mouth GF bread, a soft faux-egg, fried greens, fried onions and avocado. it was loaded! this summer we tried it twice, once at both locations. both times the bread was dry and chewy and there was only the faux-egg with about 1/2 tsp of avocado spread on the bread so you'd easily miss it. so disappointing.

We asked what the soup was at the beaches location after driving there only to be told \"we've been out of soup for 2 days\". my immediate thought was, \"well, do you have a pot?\". I mean, 3 sad-looking sandwiches in the case and no soup?

The awesome grilled veg tapenade sandwich is gone, as is the tempeh mock tuna which turned me on to Tori's in the first place. The less clean, utterly predictable faux-BLT remains, but it's not something I would get again.

There's no online menu, no in-store flyer menu and they serve 3 different sandwiches at the Canary location (with seemingly embarrassed staff apologizing for the slim pickings) and 4 sandwiches at the beaches location (unless they run out, because they can't make more).
Such a great concept, I'd love to see Tori's succeed with the items that made me love them in the first place, and by having proper materials out so consumers can see what they offer. Pics of sweets on their website are not enough. Spending hours trying to find out when the canary location would open and what the correct times + days were should not be a hassle for the customer, but it took me hours. 

At this point I would not return, which is too bad since I've gone 10+ times within 2 weeks this summer and last, and my gf came from California specifically looking forward to Tori's, even taking my mom there once. Now she's as jaded as I am. I've referred many customers, but I can no longer do that unless things change.

update: the owner told me that they now make the bread off-site and have it delivered to the 2 locations. This explains why the freshness is gone. They've expanded aster than quality control could keep up."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best DONUTS I've ever consumed... Plus it's a reasonable size, didn't regret it or feel gross afterwards.. 
Flat white was good, not great. Used soy milk, tasted bad.  I understand now they don't have dairy, explains that! I guess I just find soy gross. Maybe you will love soy!"}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe. 

You'll find amazing soy/coconut lattes"}
{"text":"I reached out to Tori for delivery and spoke with Marcella. Not only was she incredibly kind and patient but she quickly processed my delivery order, allowing me to surprise and delight my gluten free family. The response at home was above all expectations. They loved every bite of the donuts, cupcakes, banana bread and hearty bread loaf. My thanks to Marcella - I will definitely be placing another order (and hope to see a location pop up on Bloor west one day)."}
{"text":"Being touted as one of the top bakeries in Toronto is impressive for sure...but finding out that this is a vegan bakery has blown the top off most people! I was a skeptic at first but after several visits.. I have to admit. This stuff is really good.

Now, before we jump ahead, I am not touting this as health food or even remotely healthy. Veganism doesn't always equate to being healthy. So going forward just throw out the notion that this is vegan because all I really am concern with is if this stuff taste good.

These guys serve one of the best butter tarts I have tasted. Quite often a tart is judged by it's filling but I think the real gem is in the pastry. These guys make it super flaking, light and most impressive of all flavourful but not greasy. The filling is of course sinfully good but I enjoyed the fact that it's a little less on the sweet scale. We've had various soups over the year here and I can tell you they are great. The flavours are always clean and balanced. You can actually taste all the individual components of it. The bonus is the crackers that they serve with it. I mean, I can't tell you the number of times people have tried to buy the crackers on their own only to be told it's served only with the soup! Their coffee is good but being a coffee snob I would say it can be improved but it's still in the upper echelon of what you can get in the city. We've had other baked goods and there is a common theme here that I appreciate. The pastries are light, airy and non-greasy. The flavours are often light but super balanced and harmonious.

This is a must try if you are still on the fence. I heard that they are going to offer regular dinner service soon and I can't tell you how excited I am!"}
{"text":"We went there by coincidence after seeing the good ratings at Yelp. Everything was delicious: specially, scones were great."}
{"text":"We've had nothing but wonderful experience with Tori's bake shop! Initially we had ordered a gluten free cake for our small court house wedding ceremony and unfortunately it was quite dry and we threw the whole thing away, I contacted Tori personally and she promised to make us a new cake whenever we requested, any flavor, free of charge. I thought that was so considerate, going above and beyond with customer service is somewhat a rarity these days. The cake was amazing and super fresh. We then decided to move forward with ordering three cake for our big wedding celebration with custom flavours/icing detail. They were all magnificent and the guests loved them! 
Every once in awhile I also stop in and grab a coffee and muffin or something.
 Lovely, quaint environment with great staff!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan cupcakes I've ever tried. You can't even tell they don't have dairy in them. I usually get a mix of cupcakes in different flavours to last me for the week :) The savoury pockets are great as well. Definitely worth a try even if you are not into dairy-free/gluten-free food."}
{"text":"Even if you're nowhere near being vegan or gluten free, this place still has the tastiest cupcakes and pastries in the neighbourhood!  Seasonal tastes, as well as savoury items. Ambiance feels really sunny and twee. Be prepared to pay a premium, but rest assured you will receive high quality."}
{"text":"Not vegan myself but friends recommended and it happens to be 100m from house!  The store itself is very cute and beaches fitting with a coffee bar at front with display and a small bench outside to enjoy treats in the sun! I was picking something up for a friend and staff working were helpful pointing me I. The right direction food wise! Ended up buying a chocolate vegan and gluten free donut and it was amazing. I have never had gluten free or vegan baking but would definitely try again!  The donut was soft and non greasy with a very \"gluten\" tasting bite to it, I could not believe it was vegan and gluten free AND still delicious. Going to try and frequent once a week for coffee and sweet treat !"}
{"text":"Oh my my.... This place was on my list of destinations while in town and it was totally worth the drive to the beaches area! (Plus we got to see a lot of cool stuff in this neighborhood which we might have missed if Tori's hadn't caught my eye on Yelp!)

All vegan and all amazing!  Cutest cupcakes with mini donut toppers, both so moist and delicious... And the cinnamon roll was the best we've ever had!  Really, not to missed, also is the sandwich!  They make the crumpet and ours was stuffed with tofu scramble, cartelized onions, greens... So good!

Cute and friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Tori's interior was so peaceful, and their staff so inviting! I took a bite of their mixed berry vegan cupcake and fell in love instantly. The berry compote inside was also a lovely surprise.  I was so impressed I bought another one (and a grapefruit cupcake) home!"}
{"text":"So so good. Vegan and predominantly gluten-free. So much better than any vegan bakeshop I've been to yet (and there are some other stellar ones in the city) and they are pretty creative with the offerings for us vegetable types. 

The Ba(con) is great - although not necessarily bacon'y - and their donuts totally worth the calories. I highly recommend going for \"after hours\" dinner there. It's their time to shine. You can safely order basically anything from the lovely people there... just wish they were in a more convenient location."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been going there for a little over a year and it might be my favourite place in the city. The staff is super nice, and the space is clean and bright, and it's located just a few minute walk from the beach. Pretty much a perfect spot. 

They're always working on new items, and they already have a super wide array of choices. The cinnamon buns, savoury scones (the sweet potato scone is amazing!), the coconut BLT and the new vegan ice cream sandwiches are just phenomenal. Oh, and they just made a new cinnamon bun/croissant--totally delicious. I love stopping by for one of my favourite snacks and a mocha.

Compared to other vegan bake shops in the city, this is hounds down the best. If I lived closer to it, I'd be going way too often."}
{"text":"Favourite bake shop in the beaches by far!!! Had the latte and breakfast cookie. The cookie kept me full and satisfied. 
Great place to catch up with friends. 
Cozy atmosphere and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Cute, yes. 
Charming, yes.
Vegan, yes.
$17.50 for a small roasted veggie sandwich (no side salad or anything), cinnamon bun and coffee (just a plain coffee, nothing fancy), yes. 
What!!! My sandwich and cinnamon were ok, but not worth $17.50. The cinnamon bun was a bit different than the non-vegan ones, a bit chewier and not worth the $4.50. The sandwich was ok, and the addition of a bean spread to accompany the roasted veggies is a nice touch but is most definitely was not worth the price.

Holy - I think vegans are being exploited! And I believe this confirms my theory that vegans are so desperate for vegan dedicated places that they all consistently give 4+ stars to vegan restaurants whether these restaurants deserve it or not.

Too $$ for what you get."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Tori's is still cute as a button and if you can make it out to the Beach, a great stop in this village that feels so far away from home. 

I ATE
Tori's now has ICE CREAM SANDWICHES that are gluten free! It tastes exactly like icecream except its not --made from coconut, dates and other sweet concoctions, this is the best new thing at this shop.

I've been here other times too and their chive biscuits and scones are fantastic. Get them early if you can! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
You won't be able to speak after having that ice cream sammie! Just sayin. SO GOOD. I want to go back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for their amazing cupcakes
I am in so so so much love with them. 

I got an assortment of flavours from their strawberry rhubarb to their chocolate fudge.

These desiccant treats are an absolute treat to my mouth. Not overly sweet and no artificial flavours. 
All I taste is pure, fresh ingredients that were hand crafted to perfection. This is especially apparent in their fruit icings. The flavours popped in the icing and in the centre of the cupcake. 

The quality of the cupcakes I bought are easily one of the best in toronto. Tori's has already become one of my favourites in the city after only sampling their cupcakes.

When I make another trip down I will be sure to get a dozen cupcakes and a box of new baked goodies I have yet to try. 
Simply an amazing bakeshop."}
{"text":"Taking the time to bring in an update... Still fantastic! The day time bakery stuff is still some of the best vegan baked goods in the city!

The real reason for this update is inspired by visiting Tori's After Hours. Been in 4 times now and each time was fantastic! Everything I've had (provisions, cheese plates, and different versions of the protein, salad, pasta, and dessert) have always been so excellent! Cost is high and it is easy to order A LOT of food - but you're likely to be very happy you did. Though you may feel a bit of regret after paying the big bill."}
{"text":"Had a delicious brunch at Tori's today. I'm vegetarian, my friend is vegan and we enjoyed a cinnamon bun, scone and bagel with (beet) lox. Thank you Tori for opening such a special, quality eatery and to all the staff who make the cozy spot a delight to visit. And it's in the beach! It's perfect."}
{"text":"I first visited Tori's Bakeshop well before I was on Yelp. My dear friend, who is vegan, has meant to visit this store. I have a weakness for baked goods and desserts. I ended up dropping by this store in our old neighbourhood well before she did!

The first time I was there, I ordered a six-pack of cupcakes. I remember losing myself in the lemon vanilla cupcakes. They were moist and yummy. They weren't overly sweet, which I appreciated. I also got chocolate ones. They were decadent.

The next time I was there, it was summer. I tried the chocolate vegan ice cream. It was so creamy and fragrant with coconut in it. Yum! I took a photo on Instagram. To my delight, Tori's Bakeshop loved the photo so much that it reposted it on its feed.

I also got the cream egg, which comes just in time for Easter. For those who are vegan or lactose-intolerant, this egg is even better than the regular Cadbury eggs that you get at the drug store. So good!

I have also indulged in Tori's cinnamon bun. It's the perfect size to get your cinnamon sweet fix.

There is nothing at this store that I don't like. Staff are helpful in letting you know what's available and the ingredients that are in their products. The quality of their goodies are stellar. I love this place. 

Prices are more expensive than typical bakeries. So, be prepared to pay a little more for quality baked goods.

This store also has sandwiches and beverages. It's definitely more than just dessert.

Parking can get hectic. I have been lucky to get parking right outside the store. There are plenty of side streets, so you're good.

{"text":"It's nice to have a vegan bakery in the east end! Most of the vegan places I am aware of are in the core. Its nice that this place is a hop and a skip away. 

I have come here several times for sandwiches, baked goods and coffee. The Sammie's are good and they have a decent selection to choose from. I have had their BLT which was quite yummy. I have also ordered their cupcakes as a treat and was quite happy with them. They are a tad on the expensive side, much smaller and not as pretty as some other vegan bakeries I have been to in the city. But they sure are delicious. 

A friend who was not vegan came with me and ordered a scone for breakfast. He devoured it and was quite impressed that it was vegan.

Overall, I had a good experience...the staff was friendly, service was good and the food was tasty!"}
{"text":"Take out Cupcakes review, 3 flavors, 6 cupcakes.

Once ambience is isolated and it's just the cupcake, I found the cupcake didn't stand up to the hype.

Please note I really like the cafe, organic food concept and am sure all baked goods are made here lovingly and all with superior natural ingredients. But if you are simply looking for a good cupcake fix and and non vegan then this place is ok and more pricey than Prairie Girl/Bobette & Belle for examples.

5* on presentation, a mini donut on a cupcakes?! YES please! A rainbow swirl of icing as if this cupcake was made for a unicorn, WOW I gotta have it or 6 of it...

3* The cake itself is very moist but not as light as a typical cupcake, almost had the weight and texture of a pound cake at Starbucks 

2.5* Frosting. This is my make or break decision. I know it's vegan, and I love how close it came but my bias taste is for buttercream, and Italian or Swiss meringue butter cream at that. So based on this, you let me down cupcake. 

I ate all 5..but my heart and stomach was not satisfied"}
{"text":"Thank's to Val G's previous excellent review, my vegan sweet tooth began to ache badly and was jonesing for a fix once I learned that Tori's Bakeshop opened up close by to me.

 Walking in I can't help but marvel at how adorably chic the set-up is here at Tori's with a serene ivory palette playing off pale olive green mouldings, I feel as though I've stepped into an editorial layout from Domino Magazine, it was that awesome!  What brought me here however is the fact that Tori's bakes some mean vegan treats.   

I tried the GF \"butter\" tarts, a GF \"cheese\" and chives biscuit and a non GF (I'm allowed to cheat a little right?) Cinnamon bun.   The butter tart is extrordinary, and yes, I could not believe there is no butter in this tart!   The chive and \"cheese\" (Daiya, I suspect) biscuit is divine with the desireable crumply texture and just the right amount of soda'd saltedness, and lastly the Cinnamon bun was the right combination of sticky cinnamon goodness, coupled with a generous helping of rich frosting and a firm and pleasantly textured pastry.  

Although the selection is still small and in it's infancy the super sweet & friendly counterperson assured me that Tori's will soon be introducing more goodies to the roster as well as vegan/GF baked breads, so there is much to look forward to from Tori's in the near future.

 Hand's down Tori's have won my heart as the best vegan baked goods I've tasted in T.O.  Whether you are Vegan, Gluten-intolerant or not you deserve to indulge yourself at Tori's quaint little gem of a boutique bakeshop."}
{"text":"Amazing spot - I'm not vegan (or even vegetarian!) but the treats here make me swoon. I had an amazing almond milk latte and a vegan cinnamon bun on my last visit. It was delicious. I also LOVE the vegan donuts. The environment is also absolutely adorable and perfect for an afternoon coffee date. Love!"}
{"text":"Desserts are unbelievable good! We are going with them for our wedding desserts. Tori and her staff were very attentive and welcoming. Donuts, cupcakes and cookies were all very good."}
{"text":"The best cafe/bakery we discovered in Toronto so far with decadent cookies and extra points because you can get any flavor of tea served cold, and rather than just pouring hot tea over ice, they carefully make you a cold tea. Perfect for your trip to the Beaches."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for coffee and something quick to eat after a walk on the beach. There is a wide variety of sweet and savoury bites to choose from (all vegan)! I had the focaccia (delicious and a generous serving) and their vanilla cupcake which was perfection! The coffee here is great too, I had an almond milk cappuccino and a flat white!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have always loved my baked goods -- the real deal, buttery, gluten-full kind -- but recently my belly hasn't been tolerating them so I've started checking out some of the vegan bakeries around the city. Of all the vegan treats I've sampled, Tori's are among the best. Their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie was chewy and had just the right amount of salt, and the chocolate brownie was nice and fudgey (although it tasted a bit too much of coconut oil imho).   Their cinnamon bun deserves special mention because it is seriously legit -- Great dough and heavy on the cinnamon filling. Vegan or not, the cinnamon bun is worth trying."}
{"text":"In short:  Nice variety of Gluten-free vegan sandwiches near \"the beaches\" BUT lacking in their selection of other gluten-free bakeries (with selection that do exist having a mediocre taste). Poor service. & a previous history with false marketing on social media. 

As a celiac this store was a gem to eat sandwiches at. If you are feeling a interesting combination of items on delicious gluten-free bread, this place is for you. 

However, let me warn you about the two problems of this establishment, and the reasoning behind my low rating... The awful service and misleading marketing. 

The Service: Every-time I've walked in to the store & the dark haired Australian lady is at the counter I've learnt to walk out. The snottiness & \"higher than thou\" attitude puts a downer on my meal. Not only has she ignore myself & other customers, multiple times to talk to those she deems on her level. 

Misleading Marketing: This is an issue I've noticed prior to ever attending their cafe. On their social media they like to boost about their variety of gluten free & vegan options. Although I assume all items there are vegan, beware that not all is gluten free. Disappointment ensues when you realize that they do not offer the most appealing of their parties as gluten free, & that their selection consists mainly of cupcakes & donuts (which you can find at most gluten-free bakeries in the city, with a much better taste!)."}
{"text":"This is an organic/all natural/vegan bakery. They have some gluten free items, but depending on how intolerant you are obviously these items can't be guaranteed GF as they are produced in the same location as non GF items. Regardless it's some of the best tasting baked goods we've ever tried! 

The decor is thought out to even the smallest details. You almost feel like you're in a café in France. 

I can't recommend Tori's Bakeshop enough."}
{"text":"Tori's bake shop is a new discovery for my new gluten free diet, it has been a difficult few weeks looking at cakes but not being able to eat any! 

It is definitely an upscale and pricey alternative to a regular bake shop! The decor is nice and there is only two seats with sofas and they include a sign, warning that the sofa seats are for bigger groups and that if you are 1-2 people, the seats were not made for you! I thought this was a bit snobby which is why I took off a star. As much as you can tell people where to sit, you should not outright put a sign on the table indicating the obvious. 

As for the cupcake I have been craving for. It was a little dry but tasted amazing compared to the cupcake empty life i have been living. Moving on I think I can find a much better bake shop without the snobby hipster attitude."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Tori's, and I can easily say it's my favourite cafe. The food is so wholesome and delicious, which is really hard to find for a vegan in the beaches. The donuts are AMAZING, as well as the various drink choices. I can't wait to try the new holiday donut!! No refined sugar is really important to me and it makes me so happy to know that they don't use too much sweetener in their baked goods. This is all over the place, but this is a must for vegans (and everyone) in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a vegan bakeshop. I am not a vegan.

However, this ended up not being an issue at all, as the cornmeal blueberry scone I had was DELICIOUS. I also tried a pistachio biscotti that was excellent, while my friend indulged in a gooey looking cinnamon roll and my husband had a cupcake. The baked goods, across the board, were high quality.

I have a personal hangup about vegan substitutes for non-vegan items, so the savory items mimicking BLTs or cheese and bacon (in scone form) weren't for me. I was actually hoping for a savory item when we popped in, so was a little disappointed that all of the savory items were meat or cheese pretenders. I'd have gone for a seitan sandwich over a \"B\"LT.

Tori's really shines with its pastries. If I lived in Toronto, I could see Tori's becoming a place to stop for an occasional treat."}
