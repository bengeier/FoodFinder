{"text":"great place to get drinks. they use fresh fruits for the drinks. much better than chat time or other ones. very friendly owners and close to Seneca college."}
{"text":"I tried the Fruit Smoothie one morning when I had to stop in at Dollarama. The lady working is super nice and said I could mix 2 fruits, so I chose Banana and Coconut. You can also choose milk or no milk (I like no milk). I liked that it wasn't overly sweet. Should have upgraded to the large size for the extra 50 cents.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After the sour tasting mango drinks we've had in Fairview we tried this place, in Peanut plaza...and kept coming back!

First the price is right! And second the mango smoothie and slush are always on point! Never sour, but smooth and refreshing. Bad day? Grab one and it's going to help turn it around!

I recommend the papaya/coconut smoothie too! Real fruit is used...real pulp...everything real! Not some random concentrate jug of syrup.

I haven't tried the bubble tea yet but it's on my list."}
{"text":"It's a hidden secret as this one does not show up on search results. The lady at the shop is quite nice and will make suggestions. You can mix and match fruits and add tapioca to your bubble tea. She will let you know  the smoothies and slushes that are popular. It costs only 50 cents to upgrade to the large size. There is an Avocado and Mango smoothie which is a popular one. My favourite was Mango + Banana. The youngsters love this place. It's definitely a healthier choice. There is some place to sit and enjoy your drink and yes they serve some food too (fish) which apparently goes well with the drinks!"}
{"text":"Perfect hole-in-the-wall place. The bubble tea is quite good, pretty on par with Chatime, definitely better than Ten Ren's. I usually drink the Milk Black Tea, and the tapioca is perfectly made. The women who work there/own it are very nice and pleasant. They also serve Yogën Früz, which is perfect for my little ones. Makes sense to get the large for only .50 more."}
