{"text":"First time here. Sitting at patio- which isn't packed. Server is tending table next to ours and behind us.  We haven't been even acknowledged  with \" hello\" or bonjour Even they have something against kids ( we were with 4 yo) or bad manners. We haven't felt welcomed snd after 10 minutes of being completely  ignored we left."}
{"text":"Really bad food, service, and over priced. Should have taken the picture of the sandwich. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ce petit établissement avec terrasse propose des sandwich, des soupes, des salades sous forme de petites formules idéales pour déjeuner entre midi et deux ou bien pour combler une petite faim comme ce fût le cas pour nous qui sortions du musée d'archéologie et d'histoire situé au bout de la rue.  Ils proposent donc de très bons petits sandwichs ou tartines accompagnés de soupe ou de salade. Ajoutez-y une boisson est votre repas, certes modeste, est réglé !"}
{"text":"It is what it is! Small menu, reasonably priced. We're doing a lot of walking and didn't want anything to heavy. I had a bagel with ham & cheese and my husband had a grilled panini with cheese and tomato. It was tasty and enough food. Nothing fancy though, so when you read through negative reviews it is what it is ! Simple food with a nice atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Low key spot for a good,flavorful light sandwich. Cocktails were good and the food flavorful without being fussy. A good choice to recharge after a long walk."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe near the waterfront. There is a patio outside to enjoy when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"Service was really spotty even though the patio only had about four occupied tables (out of at least 15).  There also wasn't anyone eating inside since it was pretty hot outside.    Our server was a nice guy but he was not attentive at all.  I also asked him for an ashtray and he said there was no smoking on the patio even though another patron two tables behind us was clearly smoking on the patio... I'm not sure if they were regulars so they were allowed to keep doing it or if the waiter didn't legitimately see her smoking but it was super irritating.    The drinks here are expensive and the iced coffee tasted more like a watery milkshake than coffee.  I was not happy with what we ordered but the patio overlooked the water and it was a nice, quiet day to sit outside and enjoy the weather.  Also, when I went to pay, the two servers inside allowed me to bother them and speak French and chat since I don't get a chance to do that often in the US.  I enjoyed their humoring me so two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Terrasse agreable dans le vieux Montreal pour un dejeuner ou casser la croute avec salades et sandwiches ou creme glacé. Prix économique !"}
