{"text":"You will not find better Pho anywhere. Vietnamese locals eat here and they get their catering from here too. I have had Pho in dozens of other places and they all have too much sugar and the spice mixture is usually too strong. Not here. Now I don't even bother trying other Pho.   The pork stir fry on rice is awesome if you want something besides soup.  She works by herself so if the place is busy you will might have to wait a bit. Grab a drink from the cooler. You are eating home made food here."}
{"text":"I totally understand the \"hole in the wall\" aspect that other reviews mention but the food is great!  I've eaten here several times prior to tonight and have enjoyed all of my meals.  Tonight, I ordered the beef pho and egg rolls and both were so good!  Owner/cook was super friendly and food was ready in 10 min.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Alright, so there isn't anything great to say about the decor or the layout of the restaurant.  It's rather... uh.. lacking in ambiance.  There are a couple of basic tables and chairs and some old lookin' posters on the walls and a crappy tv by the cash register, so I always take my food to-go.  The staff is nothing to rave about either, they're usually pleasant, but I can't say they go out of their way to interact with the customer.  Which is fine, I just want to place my order and go home, so less talky - more cooky.  On to the most important aspect of this place - I love the Pho Ga and it hasn't disappointed me yet (if you take it to go, they compartmentalize the garnishes, chicken and noodles and broth).  The egg rolls are always tasty and come with a nice spicy oil dipping sauce.   The spring rolls with the peanut sauce on the side are decent.  Com Ga Nuong (chicken in a spicy reddish sauce, cucumbers as garnish - which helps cool the heat of the sauce, and sticky rice) is my back-up order when I'm not in the mood for the Pho Ga.    Again, I'd suggest take-out rather than dining in."}
{"text":"My favorite restaraunt. The pho is excellent. If out get past the decor, and eat the food, I can't imagine not liking it. I feel high after eating her food."}
{"text":"I stopped in this little place for lunch today and, to tell the truth, I was very pleasantly surprised.  As others have noted, the decor and ambiance leave lots to be desired but, that aside, the Pho Dac Biet was very, very good.  I enjoyed a Medium sized bowl that came with all the ususal tasty accompaniments... lime,  bean sprouts, etc.  The mint leaves, however, were a little past their prime.  The broth was hot and delicious and included a generous serving of sliced, tender  beef.  The owner/cook/server was very pleasant and efficient.  I hope you'll give this place a try and keep it in business!"}
{"text":"This was my first Pho experience! Yay!! I've been told how amazing pho is, how it's great when you have a cold, and how amazing it is when you're freezing through winter. Now that I've sampled pho,  I feel like I can order it more confidently in the future, once I am back home and looking for something to  keep me warm on the cold Minnesota snowy winters.   I was staying at my friend's house in Lakewood and we were sitting in his living room, weighing our options for food. I wanted to try something with some spice, something a little more exotic. We had been dining on american food and I wanted something different. He decided to try Khiem's Cuisine,  almost on a dare, because the reviews are hit and miss on the place. We decided to go here and settle the star-score once and for all.  First off- don't come here if you're a foodie snob. Don't come here if you want someone to kiss your ass  and make you feel like the King of Lakewood. Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy dine-in experience. This place is a total hole in the wall, very minimal decor. It's not pretty inside, nope. But, I like that. It's a roof over your head and a chair under your butt,  and for me, that's good enough. The food really is the star of the show here. The woman that seated us was nice  and she brought us our bowls of pho very quickly. After serving us our food,  she talked on the phone for awhile,  so we were left to eat our food and enjoy each other's company.  The pho was very good! It was served nice and hot, fragrant and tasty. It was pleasing to all my senses in a way  that only a really good bowl of soup can be. It warms your belly and sort of opens up your sinuses in a way that is comforting and theraputic. I can really see how people like to eat pho when they are trying to beat the winter woes away."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here. My friend and I pretended that we didn't have any cash so we left before we ordered. We saw that they don't take credit cards and we figured we could use it as the excuse to leave. I see that some say the food is good; but how did you get through with even ordering it? We go to some dives together, but this place seemed like third world inside. We were just plain creeped out. We ended up at Thai Kitchen."}
{"text":"If you're lookin' for fancy-pants, don't go here.  Khiem's is great for take-out!  I emphasize take-out!  Not the cleanest or most aesthetically pleasing of restaurants, but perhaps with some more take-out business this could improve?  My date and I were craving some spring-rolls and healthy eats so we headed to our usual joint only to realize they were closed on Mondays.  Bummer, but not for long because we found Khiem's.  The one and only employee working was very nice.  She hustled, as she was our server and our cook.  We did order hot tea and ice water.  I'd say approximately 10 minutes after we ordered drinks; we got the hot tea only.  We also received all of our food at the same time; the appetizer came with the meals.  The food we ordered was the spring roll, a small Pho, Bun, and steamed vegetables.  Everything was extremely tasty for our famished bellies.  Fresh, fresh, fresh (obviously, as our server was gone from sight after taking our order into the kitchen to sweat over a hot stove for us) and I have to say, I was impressed with the Pho.  The spring rolls were good, and I loved my steamed veggies.  Prices are cheap which makes Khiem's all the better.    Go ahead, give them a call, and go pick up your food.  You'll be happy you tried it!"}
{"text":"So when you're benefited with a hole in the wall pho place like this it's hard to give it any less than four stars.  Number four med or lg is suggested! Ask for a couple extra packs of the hoisin and sriracha sauce combo if you want it spicy.   Number eight is also an awesome alternative. Light and fresh. Tender beef with rice noodles in a peanut sauce. Definitely a must try.  Lets not forget the egg rolls. Crispy and delicious with fish sauce vinaigrette. Don't be scared to try the sauce served with. Your truly missing out if you decline.   I also have to include the disclaimer that my rating is based on food alone. Not the best of environments to eat in so take out is the recommended route."}
{"text":"NO ONE HAS WRITTEN A REVIEW FOR THIS PLACE?  OMG I have been going here for years and it is amazing.  People always talk about PHO from more \"trendy\" places and this place has the best stuff in town. THE LOW-DOWN 1. Food- amazing.  2. Recommends- London Broil Pho and the Spring Rolls.   3. Price- Cheapest I have ever experienced 4. Location- Right off of 90 and plenty of street parking 5. Staff- Extremly friendly and very fast.  I have never waited more than 5 minutes after completing my order The Breakdown: Get there now!  I cant believe no one goes here.  Its the best kept secret in town."}
{"text":"When I step into this place....or when I asked to use the restroom...I was 100% sure I'm gonna leave without ordering anything...or I am gonna get food poison....but since my date was already sat down, so I have to order...we already developed a plan what's gonna happen if we do get food poison  The food is amazing! As soon as I tasted it, I was thinking: what food poisoning? Let me just poison to death with the good food in my bellie.   Ordered #4, medium-sized, def not enough for me."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had beef pho. Nothing extraordinary. What really, really bothered me the most was that the one person working - I am guessing is the owner served us quite quickly. There was a couple of ladies that walked in shortly after us placed their order after the phone rang. The owner stayed on the phone talking the entire time while cooking, while bringing the dishes out to the ladies, while bringing their chopsticks out... All of which I thought was quite rude - especially while serving people. Tell whoever called that you have customers and will call back later. The owner stayed on the phone quite awhile in the back of the storefront restaurant where we could hear her on the phone the entire time we were eating and then while waiting for our check. There was one restroom and my husband went first, but he didn't mention to me the big mop bucket with nasty water sitting between the restroom and the kitchen. Pretty disgusting. I won't go back. It wasn't that great & the service was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I walked in, looked around at the filth, and walked out. If you really want Asian, try another neighborhood. If you want to eat in this area, there's plenty of other choices within 500'."}
{"text":"Even though this place isn't the prettiest of restaurants you shouldn't ever judge a book by it's cover. This woman who works here can make a mean Pho, fried rices, and spring rolls. This woman works hard to provide to be your server and then go back and cook you authentic Vietnamese food on a stove. This place definitely needs more love. I assure you it looks shady and unattractive but don't judge it until you sat down and ordered one thing and tried it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It was freezing out today and inside Khiem's it was cold too. We asked for tea, and that helped us warm up.  Khiem's is not a place to go to if you're into decor.  If you're into what you put in your belly, this is the place.  I ordered their Cm tm with the optional fried egg.  It was fantastic.  The food is home style and very comforting.  Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I like this place. The owner is very friendly and has a nice sense of humor. While it is simple it is appropriate for the menu which is Vietnamese every day food. I do not expect much attention paid to decor when I eat ribs, a reuben, a hot dog or pho.  No idea why it has been reported as being dirty. I have found it more than clean enough.   Interestingly you will often find mature men eating here alone. I suspect they had been sent to Vietnam during a previously pointless war. They must find the food here similar to what they had.  As someone else remarked the chicken pho is excellent. I have had the beef pho which I also like.  I will have to try some other things from the menu but it is hard as that chicken pho is seductive."}
{"text":"This is an oustanding Pho joint.  It is more a Pho joint than a proper restaurant: the menu is very small and simple, mostly Pho, rice paper rolls, and a few breakfast items.  It is usually run by one man.  The Pho is very high-quality, and very cheap.  As an added plus, I want to remark that if you order rice paper rolls, he makes the peanut sauce up on the spot, and it is served warm and very fresh.  The food here is simple but everything here is fresh and good."}
{"text":"First time I went there, it was amazing! Definitely 4.5 stars for good quality and price!   However, I've went there 4 times and have called there about 5 times since and it's been closed during its normal business hours - every time! I've written to their Facebook and left voicemails - no responses.   I'm wondering if this place is gone for good? Will gladly boost my rating up if it exists!  She was on vacation! Now she's back and the food is delicious and very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"While I love their food and often get it for pick up, I have tried twice in the last two days to order Pho during their business hours and haven't been able to get through. I get the #4 medium size with tofu and their spring rolls are to die for. My only suggestion would be for them to be consistent with their hours or update the information for their true hours of operation..."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place! It's not Superior Pho, but the pho here is definitely serviceable and the people are super nice. Only bummer is that they don't take credit card, so bring cash!"}
{"text":"MEH is right...I wanted SO MUCH for this place to be amazing. I moved recently to Lakewood from the East Side (Where I would frequent #1 Pho - AMAZING) and was looking for a solid Pho place. None of the Pho accoutrements were included and my vegetable stir fry was four carrots and two pieces of broccoli, LOTSA of onions and all in a creamy white goo that really turned me off...not to mention it was served in styrofoam container and had spilled everywhere. I will drive the extra miles for the best from now on... bummed."}
{"text":"Hi my friends..   I cant begin to tell you how gross ..HHUURRRRLLLUGGGVOMITTTTPPUUKKEEHHEEAAVVEEPPUUKKEE...   Sorry -   Please don't go here. unless you are the health Dept. wanting to shut it down or some smarmy newly graduated reporter looking to make his mark.   The girl, my son and I decided to visit a pho place that was on yelp as well received - made a mistake and picked the wrong one....oh God were we wrong!   We walk into this 16X16 space to see a person watching the TV and lording over 6 dingy tables.   Thinking we have the right Yelp place ( we were off by 8 blocks) we sat down. none the less,   Sticky plastic table clothes...dirty napkin on the table and another in the sauce tray (which has 2 of the 4 sauces empty) as the girl continues to watch the TV.   NO ONE IS HERE...THE PLACE IS EMPTY.   ASIAN GIRL IS WATCHING TV..THE PLACE IS MORE DIRTY THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST GLANCE...FLOORS, WALLS ALL...DISGUSTING.   Son wants to leave...girl is apprehensive but being kind cause I love pho, and we think we are in the right spot due to our incorrect reading of Yelp...lol   We get menus covered in sauce and sticky shit.   Now the girl is getting upset....I try to keep everybody ok so I can taste the mythical PHO that I mistakenly thought existed here.   10 minutes go by as the lone server ignores the lone guests...hmmmm   Finally she arrives to take our order.   I ask her to please clean the sticky , 5 dollars vinyl table cloth before we eat.   She says \"ok\"..rather miffed.   NOW HERE IS THE POINT OF THIS REVIEW...   I MAY NEVER BE ELITE ON YELP CAUSE I MOSTLY REVIEW REALLY GOOD OR REALLY POOR PLACES. I EAT AND PLAY AS WE ALL DO...JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BANK TELLER OVER THAT POST OFFICE ... OR AN AVERAGE PLACE TO EAT.SO I STAY WAYS FROM REVIEWS OF AVERAGE PLACES ON AVERAGE DAYS...JUST ME I GUESS!   Anyway....the front end person-server-manager-cook-whothefuckknows  comes back to our table with a bar towel.   The kind that is NORMALLY nappy and white.. except this one is not!!!!   WTFFFF...it is grey ( like a mop) and smells ( like a mop).   She splashes all of us with smelly grey towel water as she sluices the towel across the table cloth..her hands are wet with this same dirty putrid water..   OMFG...how in America can restaurants be allowed to operate at 3rd world levels -- this place is FUCKED!!!!!!  We left right after our mop water event...cancelled our orders ..put on our coats and just marched out- pissed off and sickened   NEVER EAT HERE...EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!   uhhhhhhhh   Out!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first place I ever tried Pho many years ago and to this day still my fav!  The Bo Luc Lac is awesome too and I havnt seen it anywhere else.  I think the son of the actual Khiem runs the joint now.  I miss the days of walking in there and seeing Khiem, chewing on his toothpick.   The place is no frills and I like that.  No d-bag, Iphone power lunch types in here much.  Just a nice, quiet, down-low meal.."}
{"text":"To call this place spartan would be an understatement. However, I've had nothing but delicious Vietnamese food here. The husband and I came on a recent weekend evening and were served by the lone woman running the place. We ordered one spring roll apiece, and they were hot, crispy, and tasty. He got a large bowl of pho and I got a small (one of the reasons I like this place- I don't have to have a vat of soup if I don't feel like it). The pho was a lovely specimen- flavorful broth, tender beef, toothsome noodles, and bean sprouts, lime, peppers, and Asian basil on the side to mix in.  No liquor license. We had to be happy with ginger ale.  Takeout would be a good idea if you're big on atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, and reasonably priced. This is literally a hole in the wall type place (actually I think I did see a few holes in the walls now that I think about it)  Its one fatal flaw?  Well..... I'm not one usually to be squeamish about small mom-and-pop Asian places that others do not dare to go into because it's \"not clean\"  (which I find usually means not cookie-cutter chain restaurant standard, like PF Changs or Olive Garden).  BUT, I was a little grossed out by the silverware.  Both our soup spoons had a little bit of food still crusted on them, and the spoons themselves were ancient, with layers of discoloration."}
{"text":"Good pho and great prices.  Plus its right around the corner from me."}
{"text":"I think I found my new place to go for pho.  Khiem's is conveniently located off the W 140th / Bunts Rd exit on Madison Ave, one block from Angelo's Pizza. I usually go to MInh Anh for pho and I feel the MSG and salt funneling through my constricted capillaries immediately. Minh Anh broth is probably the most flavorful and well spiced in the city but it comes with the price of physical abuse. The broth at Khiem's is nice and mellow. A small bowl is $5.25 and it is definitely enough to fill the stomach. I made the mistake of coming to Khiem's after working out. My pores were already open so I was sweating more than usual. If I am not crying in my beer, I am sweating in my pho. I also had the beef vermicelli dish which I barely could eat after the pho bowl. The woman working there was very nice and we had some good conversation about family, friends, Berea and Lakewood. The lady at Tay-Do in Parma is the polar opposite of this charming woman. I wish that Khiem's marketed their product or had advertising because it gets overlooked in the Cleveland pho game. People hear about Superior Pho and travel down there all the time. It is my duty to inform the good people of Cleveland that there is another option out there for outstanding pho. And at $5.25 a bowl, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Cheap, unassuming, unhyped, and ridiculously tasty. I can't believe this was my first visit to a place I pass on a daily basis. Took my out of town yelp pal to have something more exotic than the pizza and pub food  we had the previous days. The giant bowl(a medium) of London broil pho was just about the most fragrant and complex food I've had in a long, long time. It was so down home comforting in it's soupiness, yet deliriously foreign with it's Mekong melange of herbs and spices.   Once you are served, you are not constantly pestered. You can just eat in peace and have conversation with your dining partners about all the weird places you've been, the way you cook foreign dishes at home, and the people you know who hate to try anything new. You lose yourself in that cauldron of truth serum sitting before you. Some reviewers and tv hosts speak of these transformative moments they have while dining. It's happened to me very rarely. But it definitely happened to me here. Forget take out. You do yourself a disservice if you don't just shut out the world and spend a quiet, contemplative hour or so staring into that sea of basil and lime. I might not ever go back to some of the places I hit this past week, but this one is definitely on the list of return business."}
{"text":"Very relaxed. Authentic meals, Tam is a wonderful woman and knows how to put together a bowl of Pho. I ordered the Pho Ga, the small was only 5.25$ and I was just about stuffed. We need more places like this popping up, people who want their business to prosper and actually put their heart into it and deserve the money made. Not flashy, valet parking chains taking a shit ton of money for no good reason.   I'd rather give to people like me, not rich snobs, who only care about their revenue coming in and a wealthy customer base. As my busy said, Madison in Lakewood has lots of potential to be an awesome place to pop up wholesome restaurants like this one and the bar potential is amazing.  Vietnamese is hard to do wrong, but it's amazing when it's done we'll. keep it up Tam, I wish you and you the best of luck. I'll definitely be back here."}
