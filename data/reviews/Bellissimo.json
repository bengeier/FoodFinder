{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Dorval. Great service.. friendly staff ..excellent food
I have been a regular there for four years, and it never has disappointed me. They charge five dollars over the SAQ price, so their excellent wine list is not a rip off.
It is a bit pricey but certainly well worth the excellent Presentation and fresh ingredients. Their seafood is always cooked to perfection and their pasta is homemade. If I ever win the lotto, I would eat there five nights a week."}
{"text":"I  am a regular at this place for a reason, great service and great food. Never disappointed. Something to be noted, many private imports on the wine list at great prices, SAQ list price +5$!"}
{"text":"The feel of the place is worth the visit. Then the staff waits on you and oh my it is first class with a very relaxed vibe. A great establishment. I had the chicken parmesan and it was very flavorful!"}
