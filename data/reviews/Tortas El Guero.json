{"text":"Excellent tortas, quick and kind service.  Sauces are delish."}
{"text":"Good torta cubana  I got the mini and it was plenty for me! Their salsa was great, not too spicy! I found it odd that they served their torta with fries tbh"}
{"text":"I went here last fall ... so my memory is fairly hazy....but I can say it was DELICIOUS.  Not a place for folks on a diet or trying to avoid a heart attack.  Yummy Yummy Yummy."}
{"text":"I've heard all about this place and I decided to try it today. I have to say they have very friendly service and all the menus items look so delicious especially all the Tortas which I had to give a thought to see which one I would choose. After contemplating on which one i finally chose the ALAMBRE Torta  and let me tell you it was the most delicious Torta I've tasted !! I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. The establishment is very clean and all condiments are clean and full unlike other places. This place deserves 10/10"}
{"text":"Definitely a place worth trying if you enjoy tortas.

We went last week on a long lazy lunch break, so we figured we'd try a new place.  We arrived shortly after 12p and the place was not empty, but far from full.  Pretty quiet actually, which I was surprised as the tortas had been very highly recommended.

The layout is nothing fancy, doesn't look like much from the outside, or the inside.  The service is very friendly and very helpful.  The guy who helped us made some great recommendations.

First off, the tortas are great.  The bread is made special for them (think it's a bolillo roll, or something like that).  But they taste fresh and go perfectly with the tortas.  

We had the milanesa de res, which is basically a breaded carne - it was fantastic - the torta comes with the meat of your choice, some jalepenos, lettuce and a couple small slices of avocado.  So simple, so delicious.  

We also tried the Cochinita torta, which was tasty, but not quite as over the top delicious as the other.  

They have a choice of a couple sauces at a little salsa bar - the red chile sauce is mediocre, the spicy chile verde was surprisingly spicy and exceptionally tasty.  I got so excited by a sample that I piled it onto my torta and ended up sweating through the rest of it!  It is sneaky spicy!

The horchata was great, if not overly memorable.  

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh succulent pork torta, how I love thee. And how I especially love thee when I buy you from El Guero."}
{"text":"They have the best torta ahogada ever! I've tried it from other places but this place hands down the best in town. Their sauce is on fire. It's so hot but it's so delicious! I ordered a side of fries and that helped cool down the sauce. I will keep going back! I also love that's it's family owned. They are so sweet and helpful. I love this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered a couple tacos, Cochinita and Desebrada, they were excellent! Perfect amount for an afternoon snack. My buddies ordered the pollo and asada tortas, everything worked together the softness of the bread, seasoning of the meat and the kick of the jalape√±o at the end. Definitely recommend this place!!

Forgot to add the service was second to none, very friendly. A true family place!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant hands down! The service is great, owners are very kind and friendly.  The tortas are the best ever! We haven't found a torta that even compares to theirs!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best torta I've had in AZ. Chocinita torta is the way to go! Careful of the salsas. Some are HOT!! Brought back lunch for the office and not one negative remark. We will be back!!! Awesome job, guys!!"}
{"text":"I love these tortas! So bomb. I usually do adobada but I've gone thru a few different ones. My favorite thing about this place might be seeing the older couple's smile. They're working there daily, well seems daily. And they are awesome. So nice, they make my day. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tortas in Phoenix! My husband and I have tried almost every place in the valley and these are by far the most delicious. The bread is amazing, the Oaxacan cheese is on point and the service couldn't be friendlier."}
{"text":"I ordered a Carnita torta. Simply wonderful... the pork was flavorful and not at all dry. The avacado was amazingly flavorful. And, best of all, the service was fantastic. The proprietor is incredibly sweet and welcoming. In this era of great tacos served up by soup Nazi-esque guys on taco trucks, dining here was refreshing. I am here on business, and there is a 100% chance I will try another offering from this menu before I leave. Do yourself a favor, and make your way to 16th St ASAP."}
{"text":"I must have a hard time reviewing places that are less than five-stars, so here is another hidden gem of the valley!  
This place is another hole-in-the-wall establishment brought my way via Yelp.
The torta el pastor was phonomenal! They have a huge salsa bar with this green concoxion that looks like it would be avacado something, but it's totally spicy as wasabi.  I dream of stuff this spicy: I completely drowned my torta in this.  My friend and I were the only people here minus a younger couple behind the counter, and an elderly couple who made the food.  My friend who came with and was as blown away as I was.  Such a great little establishment in close proximity to downtown; I'll be back."}
{"text":"As I've said before, I don't particularly like to write reviews of a place after only one visit, but it's also not every day that you stumble across one of the top 5 or so things you've ever eaten. I was driving around the area of town near Tortas el Guero, looking for Mexican food, when I caught the \"Tortas\" out of the corner of my eye. I pulled into the parking lot and decided to try it out based on the positive Yelp reviews.

Well, let's just say that those positive reviews and scores were dead on. They mainly offer tortas topped with several different varieties of meat; I opted for the pastor. Every aspect of the sandwich, including the small order of French fries that came on the side, was excellent. The meat was flavorful and tender, the bread was the perfect consistently and did not become mushy, and each half of the sandwich had a hearty slice of avocado on top. They also had a thick, creamy avocado sauce that had a surprising amount of spice to it; I opted to douse it over my sandwich to compliment the mayo and add a little extra bite. There were several other salsas and grilled onions that all looked excellent, but I didn't get a chance to try them this time (well I had the chance I just forgot to get the onions). At $7.99 for a sandwich, I didn't find it to be particularly inexpensive, but the size and quality of the food is certainly worth the asking price. The also offer a mini for $4.99 for smaller appetites and a super for $12.99, which I presume feeds two people. I should also add that the staff, who I took to be the owners, were very friendly and answered my questions with a smile. I would easily give this place a top recommendation and encourage any fan of tortas, or just delicious food in general, to try it out."}
{"text":"El dia de hoy mi familia y yo disfrutamos de unas deliciosas tortas en este lugar. Pedimos la de pierna, la cubana y una quesadilla. Estaban deliciosas, tienen una buena variedad de tortas que puedes disfrutar en un ambiente limpio y agradable, sin dejar de lado la musica regional mexicana (entre muchas, pude volver a escuchar la cancion \"tragos de amargo licor\")....realmente disfrutamos comer ahi. Les recomiendo ampliamente el lugar. Muy importante: fuimos atendidos muy amablemente por el personal, pude darme cuenta de que es un negocio familiar, y eso me gusto, pues las tortas tienen ese toque. No dejen de ir por una rica torta con el wero!!"}
{"text":"Clean place, nice customer service. I love the tacos al pastor and the milanesa torta, the bread they use is so fresh, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had a carne asada torta and he had a piero torta! Yummy!!!! The service was quick and courteous! The decor was really cute!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot.  Great food.  Priced reasonably.  I like the Alambre Torta.  Daily specials are great.  Torta, fries, and drink for $7.99.  Nice portions."}
{"text":"The food is so good and the staff is so friendly you have to give tortas el guero a try. It is on my fav list"}
{"text":"I always passed by this place and wanted to try it.  So one evening, we called and asked what time they were closing.  They had just closed at 7pm. But the lady was so nice, she asked us what we wanted and said we could go pick it up since we told her we were disappointed it was closing and it was our first time.

When we pulled up to the place, it was really nice inside.  Very clean and spacious.  The outside and inside of the restaurant was well kept and there were some artists painting murals on the wall inside.  The lady who answered the phone was making our tortas and had everything ready within a few minutes.

We didn't want to wait until we got home, so we ate the tortas in the car.  They were delicious.  The bread was so soft and the beef was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely come back again, and hopefully next time get there before they close so we can eat in the restaurant instead of our car."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic fresh food
We happily stumbled upon this place
Tortas and Tacos are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my first review as a Yelper.. but before that Id like to say Ive recently moved back to the Valley and have been on a journey to find the best food Central Phoenix has to offer.. seeing as I live about a half mile from here I decided to give it a shot.. and boy did I hit a homerun for lunch!! For 8 bucks I took a carry-out Alambre Torta with fries.. this thing was loaded with Asada, bacon, onions, peppers and cheese.. and obviously mounds of avocado and a perfectly sliced tomato.. I was thouroughly impressed with this place and I will definitely be a returning customer who will end up trying every one on the menu.. Bravo Zulu!!!! Do yourself a favor and get ya some!!! The people are very nice and dont forget to hit up the salsa bar as the cashier will give you cups.. very very very very clean inside.. good job guys doing a craft that not only you are good at but is a delicious alternative to all that lame ass fast food out there.."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've tried almost all of their options now and they've all been delicious. My favorite so far is the alambre. They have three sizes and even though I'm a big guy, the super is awesomely huge. Great for a double meal. The mini and regular are perfect lunch sizes. Great food, great prices. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"don't know too much about tortas, but the cochinita torta I had here was really good. awesome pulled pork texture, juicy, fresh crisp lettuce, the telera bread was nice and soft.  appears to be run by a nice older mexican couple, charming, obviously takes pride in his food."}
{"text":"My co-worker brought me here for lunch one day and it was love at first bite. Upon entering we were greeted by a distinguished older gentlemen behind the counter a smile and knod from the chef as it he was saying \"you will eat good today\"   I ordered the cubana and it was blown away. Layers upon layers of meat goodness between two pieces of bread. I've had tortas before but not like this. This is a whole new torta experience.

This place is great! awesome! I absolutely recommend tortas el guero."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST tortas place in all of Phoenix. They don't have wheat bread (unfortunately) however, the food is absolutely delicious. Also, the tacos are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great tortas!!  Don't leave there feeling as heavy and greasy as some of the other torta shops.  Torta de pierna or de pollo are my favs."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Small restaurant and parking is somewhat tight. Would definitely recommend. Had the tacos pastor and guacamole. Great value."}
{"text":"Loved the tortas at this place, the cubana especially was my favorite one. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants a good torta! The owner and workers are very friendly and greet you right away. Restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Delicious.   Can not wait to go back.

It's like walking into this family's home--they are so friendly and eager to make you happy."}
{"text":"This is small family business. The owners are very nice. Customer service is great. The food top notch!  We tried a variety of their top selling tortas and they were so delicious. The carne asada quesadilla was good too. We got coconut, horchata & mango Agua Fresca which are tasty & refreshing. The salsa bar has several options if you wish to add these to your tortas but they really don't need anything else. We enjoyed our first experience and were wondering why we hadn't discovered this gem sooner!"}
{"text":"I've been hunting for good tacos and tortas since I moved here 3 years ago, and I'm so glad I found this place! It's entirely out of my way but worth the drive. I find that most AZ Mexican food is pretty bland and the meats don't have much flavor, but I was so impressed with the variety offered here. We had the cochinita, al pastor, and alambre and they were all soo flavorful. Do yourself a favor and get the alambre taco/torta... it sounds different but it totally works and might be my new favorite! The restaurant itself is adorable inside, plenty of seating and room, 2 tvs on the wall, and the staff- which appeared to maybe be all family, was so nice. I'll make the 25 minute drive here any day!"}
{"text":"Incredible....best sandwhich...great price, clean, and sweet people"}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches in this town!! Friendly environment and fast courteous service!!"}
{"text":"I'm begging you not to miss out on the opportunity to eat here!  They delivered the taste and flavor I was looking for via the Tortas and the tacos! Stop in now and try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place can really make you feel comfortable. The atmosphere is excellent. Relaxing, welcoming, and by far just like home. In comparison with other restaurants of the same sort this will far exceed in both the taste and cleanliness department. This is not to mention that this is a family owned and operate establishment and they treat everyone with a smile. That goes a long long way. Will be here plenty more."}
{"text":"This is the taco place for me. Ever since hubby and I moved to Phoenix, we have been on a relentless search for the best taco. Now, I will be honest and tell you that my husband didn't consider these tacos the best he's had but I do. I had the carne asada tacos and what really made me happy was how tender and succulent the meat was and the addition of pickled onions just blew my mind. The customer service was fantastic. We came in right before they were about to close and they not only accommodated us with making he food but also gave us an extra soda for the inconvenience of not being able to stay and eat. This is how customer service is done, folks! Lovely people, lovely place."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall, but such a gem. Their tortas and tacos are always great and the people that work there are super-nice."}
{"text":"I think I've tried every different torta they have now. All good, though the misterio is surprisingly my favorite. A full torta is probably a little much for lunch, but I get one all the time anyway and suffer through a sleepy afternoon. It's worth it. 

Also an unexpected delight: the salsa bar has some interesting flavors that go great with the fries. The guac is also very good.

The family that runs the place are some of the nicest people you'll meet.

All-in-all, a wonderful little restaurant. Just wish it were easier to get to."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, the tortas were great.  On subsequent visits, I wasn't as impressed with the quality, and prices went up a bit.  Coincidentally, they started getting a lot of press for being one of the best sandwich places in the Valley.

The cynic in me makes it hard not to think that they are coasting a bit on their rep with the gringo crowd.  This place isn't consistently fast or consistently good - and on multiple occasions, they've even been out of key ingredients early in the day.

Still, the tortas are good, and they aren't so much over-priced as other torta places are under-priced.  Decent value, decent quality, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Cute, clean, family owned place. 
It is on the pricey side and the side portions are small, REALLY Small! But food is great! Tortas are delicious and I will be back."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS I've had!!!! Delicious! Tortas are amazing as well! Try the adovada tacos, YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and made quickly. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but service was great and very clean inside."}
{"text":"CUBANA is the way to go! Stopped in for lunch today and grabbed the Cubana. I have eaten plenty of tortas and this place does it right, no gimmicks just a solid place and the place is really clean. Great prices! Only con it's a little difficult to find but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Siempre que agarro comida de aqu√≠ y le doy una mordida la torta o el taco me da la memoria de M√©xico"}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break and I had such an amazing experience. 

To begin, you can definitely tell that this is a family owned and run business because of that the service is so good. They are all very friendly and the dining is so clean.

I got the cubano with fries. The fries are just simple fries but still good. The cubano..I was sad I was full and couldnt finish it. My only problem like most sandwiches was that my aguacate kept slipping out. (real world problems) The flavors were so good and the tortilla chips are definitely worth getting you could tell they were fresh and warm and perfectly salted."}
{"text":"This place was soo good. The owners were so sweet and humble. The food was awesome the salsa bar was amazing. The place was clean. Our order came out fast. I was really impresse. Food presentation"}
{"text":"Since I'm on a Torta fix, I had to try this place out. 

I felt pretty \"guera\" walking into the place as all of the customers were clearly spanish-speaking only as well as most of the employees. Embracing my latina half, I ordered a carne asada torta to- go in my best spanish, which is about on par with a three year old idiot child. 

Be warned, not the quickest torta you're gonna get, I waited nearly half an hour. Luckily, they have telenovas playing on the tv, which are fantastically amusing, even if you don't speak the language. 

But it was well worth the wait-my torta was delish! I got it with everything, which included pico de gallo, lettuce and mayonnaise, all on grilled bolillo bread. Amazing.
They have a huge selection of tortas so there is something for everyone. 
mmm tortas, where have you been all my life??"}
{"text":"OG Tortas, this place is always on point, as authentic as it gets. Usually get the torta ahogada, it's a little spicy but really flavorful. Don't get me started on the agua frescas, GTFO!! Super refreshing and compliment the tortas to the max. Good salsas, place is always clean and the people that work there can not be nicer, come check them out or go get diarrhea at Taco Bell you lame ass!"}
{"text":"I called the restaurant at noon on Labor Day and was told that they would be open till 8 PM. I arranged to have some east valley family members meet there at 4 o'clock for Tortas. WHAT!!! They were closed. No sign. Nothing. Very bad form."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The service is friendly! I always order the ham and cheese torta. They don't use yellow cheese for the torta which makes it taste more authentic. I love the aguas and salsas."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever, hat the Cuban mouthwatering good, Stomach full but left me wanting more. Owner brought my food out to me even though they don't have a waiting staff. Looks like I will be visiting 16th St and Thomas more often."}
{"text":"Best tortas in Phoenix, hands down.  I get their chicken torta and it is so flavorful.  I just wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now with friends and coworkers. It does not disappoint. Everyone is extremely friendly and the food is amazing. Their speciality is obviously tortas, but don't completely rule out their tacos--the al pastor special is delicious. If you're in the area its a must try. If you have to travel, its STILL a must try."}
{"text":"This place is perfect.  First and foremost, the food is delicious.  I've tried 5 different kinds of tortas, and they've all been amazing.  My favorite so far is the Alahmbre with carne asada.  Their pastor is also amazing.    They do NOT skimp on the avocado, which I appreciate.  The fries are just ok, but honestly, it doesn't matter.  They have a salsa bar which has some pretty good salsa.  The green one was my favorite.  The staff is INCREDIBLY nice.  They're also super helpful, patient, and seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your time there."}
{"text":"I had this very bad craving for a torta today and I found this was the closest place to my office and it looked like it had very good reviews so I decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did, because this was the best torta I had since I moved to the states. I had the Al Pastor which was moist and properly seasoned and the horchata water wasn't overweeningly sweet like other places. Grandma cooking in the back is always a good sign of great food to come. A little bit expensive for a torta (I mean, in Mexico you get really god ones for 2-3 bucks) but I'll be definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love tortas. These are the best in town and the restaurant has a friendly staff and is always clean. Yum. I crave them weekly. You can't go wrong with the al pastor or the carne asada."}
{"text":"Look.. I'm from Austin so I was looking for a good torta to eat here in Phoenix and man that's an understatement for the torta I had here. This was beyond words AMAZING! My goodness.. Like hold up type of good. I am so sad that I'm not from here. This would be my spot, no doubt. If you come.. Try the light orange sauce. That slams with the hawaiiana torta. Mmmmm I'll be dreaming later of what I just ate. Thank you El Guero tortas!!"}
{"text":"hrm......... tortas........ 

so i'd been hearin bits n pieces about this torta place in central phx.....  
one day.... hungry me and david decides 2 check it out....... he wuz pretty happy they had a vegetarian torta...... and i gots me the Cubano.  (milanesa is like fried heaven)

they're pretty good, but not as good as Los Reyes de la Torta (formerly Torta La Pressa, the OG one on 7th st. and dunlap)

i'm still curious as to the other mexican food offerings besides the torta. 

o yea..... and i'd like 2 also mention, their fresh juices r tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very clean, tasty food, and good service. Once again, Yelp has led us to quality food and all the other traits that make for a good restaurant. Thank you"}
{"text":"I have read several raving reviews of this place.  I was disappointed the first time so I went back again thinking I had an off experience.  I was still disappointed.  I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tortas. We ordered a regular size pollo and asada.. It was the kind of meal where you're full halfway through but you keep eating anyway because it's so good. Also, they have very unique and tasty salsas. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Whoo hoo! A friend from  Nogales brought me one of these tortas 4 years ago & I've been hooked since.  Gustavo (the owner) & his lovely wife and their 2 cute kids are the beginning of this great experience.  EVERYTHING here is good and a whole lot cheaper than many bona fide Mexican places.  My favorite is the Pollo Ahogado, aka Drowned Chicken Torta.  It has avocado,just a few jalapenos (and is the only way I've ever been able to eat those), and the most amazing red sauce. I ask for the salsa INSIDE the sandwich just to be sure.  You will need 15-20 napkins and may not be able to conquer the whole thing if you're a chica like me.  By the way.....if you go in here twice, you get treated like a friend. They are awesome.  Oh! And the \"Boing\" juices are from one of the only union-run beverage cooperatives in Mexico.  :)  They 're good, too."}
{"text":"One of the best tortas I've had, if you're ever on this side of Phoenix I highly recommend it. They're fast friendly service, it looks like it's run by the family, I met the owner and he's super nice. I've tried their tacos and they were delicious, everything has a lot of flavor, the meat is super tender, I loved everything about this restaurant. They have a little salsa bar as well Next time I come I'm bringing my whole family"}
{"text":"Las tortas y los tacos son demasiado sabrosos. No hay otro lugar donde te sirvan los tacos como lo est√°n en la foto.

Siempre con la misma calidad y el servicio amable.

Mi lugar favorito en la Finiquera para comerme unos tacos de pastor. Los mejores!!

Atendidos por una familia g√ºera de Chihuahua.

La √∫nica inconveniencia es el tama√±o limitado de estacionamiento.

Todo lo dem√°s es muy bueno."}
{"text":"Service alone gets 10 stars if possible, small family business, food is great prices are fair keep it up MR Guero!!!!!"}
{"text":"Freakin' awesome!  I've been here about 5 times and am finally getting around to writing a review. Sorry, Tortas el Guero, and sorry to the viewing public for the delay. I've tried several of the tortas and have NEVER left disappointed. The bread is fresh, the toppings on the tortas are amazingly flavorful, and the salsa options are delicious. And the owners are awesome people who always prepare your food with a smile. Check it out!  Don't wait another minute."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! The tortas were a reminder of why I enjoy wearing leggings as pants. When you walk in you're greeted by a sweet older lady who just reminds you of your Tia Carmen and she takes your order. Then someone finds you in a sea of people and brings your food within a few minutes. That's all, be fat, enjoy tortas say hi to your tias."}
{"text":"Wow! This unassuming place that blends into the neighborhood is very tasty. Here is the run down on the menu;

Build or choose your own meat,

Asada, pastor (killer) pollo, cochinita (killer on a taco) Desebrada (killer on a taco) 

Tortas run $4.99 for a mini, $7.99 for a regular which I had and was over following with meat or $12.99 for a supper size. All come stuffed with mayo, mustard, shredded lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, and of course jalape√±o. 

They also serve a burrito $5.95 with your choice of meat and as well as a Quesdillas for $6.99 or some Killer and I must say killer street tacos for $1.75 each that was the perfect 3 bites overflowing with meat chopped onions and cilantro served with some limes. 

They also have 15 varieties of Tortas as well if you don't feel like creating your own. Really very clean on the inside and inviting as well. I will be back to sample the rest from this very nice family run business. They do accept credit cards. Support this local Mom and Pop place ( yes they do work and cook your order behind the counter) when you place your order. Well worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite taco shops!!!  This family owned business is the real deal.  I have been patronizing this restaurant for some time and I can honestly say that TEG is always on point.  All of their menu items are seasoned perfectly and will give you a trip to Flavor Town.  The family are always so welcoming and they listen to their customers.

I noticed today that they added tripas to the menu, so I had to give them a try, and of course they did not disappoint.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"These were the best tacos I have had in a long time! There were so many different flavors in each bite! I will definitely be going back for more next time I'm in Phoenix! The staff was very friendly. It was an overall awesome experience!"}

The Cochinita

Tortas El Guero (for me, TEG for short) is a little tortas/taco shop in the Uptown area of Phoenix.  If you are familiar with Barrio Cafe, it's right down the street.  \"Tortas,\" for you gringos (like me), is just another way of saying \"mexican sandwich.\"  TEG also provides tacos, burritos, quesadillas and the like. 

I had heard a little about TEG's tortas before I visited.  My expectations were solid without being unrealistic; however, they were a little slower at 12:30 than I had anticipated.  The crowd was predominantly hispanic , both young and old.  The restaurant itself was very clean and fairly simple.  Concrete floors, tin sheets on the wall (think Chipotle's restaurants), painted walls of yellow, brown and salmon, and framed awards and write-ups on the walls.  

Now that I think about it, what's with all the concrete floors nowadays?  Have you noticed that they are in almost every restaurant now?  I'm sure they are more affordable and definitely more durable.  I wonder if it's just an Arizona thing?  Hmmm, maybe I'll save that for another blog. 

All in all, the restaurant was very simple but clean and orderly.  Clean and orderly, unfortunately, are two areas that are often overlooked but shouldn't be...EVER!  

The staff at TEG was very polite, friendly and fast.  If you read my last post on Bertha's Cafe, I commented about the dude with no smile.  This was not the case at TEG.  I felt welcomed and comfortable.  Don't you think all restaurants should have that as a goal?

The featured sandwich for this location was the Cochinita torta.  It's a slow roasted, shredded pork served on a wonderful, light, toasted bread with fresh avocado, lettuce, tomato and pickled jalapeno.  A point worth noting for all of you avocado lovers, the avocado was perfect!  It was ripe, bright green and full of flavor.   Avocado is one of our best superfoods but is often misused.  The last thing anyone wants to see with their food is something mushy and black or green and hard.  Unfortunately, that's what we get much of the time.  I don't know where you are getting your delicious green fruit TEG but kudos for caring about quality.

The pork on the Cochinita torta was a unique combination of sweet, salty and slightly tangy.  After completing the first half of my sandwich I couldn't help but day dream about a giant Cochinita burrito.  Oh well, there's always next time.   Anyways, the sandwich was excellent!  I would happily go back again and again for this treat or one of their other items.

Now don't let me fool you into thinking the Cochinita was all I had this day.  Oh no my friends, I went after it.  I also tried their asada tacos, pollo tacos and their roasted pork quesadilla.  They were all fantastic, especially the quesadilla with it's homemade tasting tortilla.  Combine these items with a mexican bottled coca-cola and you'll be feeling mui bueno.

I give the Cochinita:

 4 out of 5 \"M's\"    for a    M-m-m-m

What do you get for $8 a great Torta with fries, a clean environment, and a spotless restroom. The staff are very friendly. You also get 5 homemade salsas to choose from. Also, you food is served on a real plate, not a box or a plate towel."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, clean, affordable, delicious.  I would happily exhaust more adjectives to describe this place, but I trust I've gotten my point across.  Add this place to the slew of amazing restaurants occupying a magical culinary stretch of 16th Street in Phoenix from CenPho to Downtown.  Barrio Cafe, Middle Eastern Bakery, Mariscos Playa Hermosa, La Santisima, and now Tortas El Guero (TEG) all occupy a special place on my taste buds for turning out some amazing food.  As with all of these places, the humble exterior of TEG might not look like much, but inside there's some great stuff happening.

TEG is located about three blocks south of Thomas on the west side of 16th Street.  You could easily pass it by amongst all the other small strip centers in the area.  Parking is limited here (maybe 6 or 7 spots) so just bear that in mind.  Once inside you're greeted by a simple but clean interior with seating for probably 40-50 hungry customers.  Order at the register here and they bring the deliciousness to you.  The big board menu behind the register gives you your options in english y espanol and includes options for burritos, tacos, sides and drink options.  But the true stars here are the tortas.

Truth be told, this isn't my first go around with the iconic torta.  Not by a long shot.  I've made numerous journeys to Los Reyes de la Torta, grabbed tortas at Taqueria El Chino, and even sampled tortas from the now defunct (but soon to be resurrected) Gallo Blanco.  To this point, I really can't say I've had a bad one yet.  For TEG, the torta that they most proudly advertise as their calling card is the Cubana.  While the ingredients do read much like a traditional Cubano sandwich (including the ham and cheese), this one takes multiple steps further.  You've got your ham and cheese sure, but here they add even more pork, a breaded steak, tomato, avocado, lettuce, mayo and even some jalape√±os.  Add a side of fries and you've got TEG's answer to the usual sandwich and fries.  To wash my meal down, I can't resist some great house made horchata.  Total for the food, drink and tax came to $13.

As soon as that sandwich came out a few minutes later I knew I'd hit pay dirt.  The layers upon layers of ingredients just staring at me like a rainbow.  Admittedly there weren't a lot of fries that came with this, but I was too busy getting fat and happy off this sandwich.  Each bite was heavenly.  Its hard not to make a mess when you're trying to bite off a tall sandwich like this, but trust me, its well worth the extra napkins.  I especially liked the steak and pork combo and the avocado smoothed out all the spices and acidic elements beautifully.  And TEG's horchata was blended very nicely indeed and provided the perfect cap to the meal.  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes and perfectly full.  The perfect quick stop for lunch or dinner.

So seriously folks, if you haven't explored TEG or this stretch of 16th Street, you seriously need to get down here.  I'm still just scratching the surface of 16th Street and already I'm positively dazzled by this culinary wonderland.  As for TEG specifically, fantastic sandwiches, reasonably priced, well kept restaurant and friendly staff.  Oh and for you vegetarians out there, they have options here for you too.  I may very well love tortas as much as I love tacos and burritos at this point.  I mean, tortas may not be able to bring about world peace.  But if they're as good as TEG's are, its a good place to start."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been delicious. This family run business is friendly and efficient.  I have brought many coworkers here and they all enjoyed the tortas and variety of salsas."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better with the service provide or the food. One of my favorite places to eat. Always polite. Provide a clean restaurant and great food."}
{"text":"Just good!   Friendly and delicious!  Tacos al pastor were good."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review yet! This is an awesome, family owned and operated torta shop. I love the aquagate veggie torta. Their guacamole type green salsa is incredible. The frescas are on point....never too sweet and they always taste natural and fresh."}
{"text":"I am a huge torta kind of Mexican, everywhere I go I have to try their Tortas. When a place specializes in Tortas I get super excited and of course the expectation is higher. So, I woke up craving a good carne asada torta today, I decided to go to this place.  The service is great they're pretty friendly which is why they get one star, the other star is for their mango agua which was pretty good. As far as the torta it was not that great, but I've  had worst. To tell u the truth I'm not sure if it was the torta or the really \"depressing\" environment in the place. I was the only one in there, the place has plain decor, no music, the AC didn't seem to be working, and there was flies.  I must say it has been the most depressing meal I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The torta was so flavorful and delicious. I had the regular size carne asada. It was the perfect size especially with the side of fries that came with. My 7 year old daughters each had a mini torta and that was just the right size for them. My picky eater asked me after she took her first bite, \"mama can we come back here?  Please\". She loved the torta. Both my daughters did. We all had agua fresca of mango!  Excellent!   We will definitely be back!! Plus!!! The service was friendly and very inviting!"}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten there for lunch it has been great! Polite and quick service. The place was pretty stylish and clean. Good prices for great tortas.

I did read about the unfortunate soul below who had a slippery take out experience, but both times I ate in the restaurant. A nice mom and pop place to enjoy a good torta."}
{"text":"They have fries?!

I pose this question because of the pictures I saw on Yelp; I got ruffles on the side with my order.

Anyway, El Guero is a nice little Torta shop that does have a pretty decent torta. I got the Cuban and it was really good. I didn't see anything on the menu that really stood out to me though besides the Cuban. The conchinita won one of the best sandwiches in Phoenix Magazine in the past, so I will be back to try it eventually. But, with some tough competition in town, it's hard to say when I'll be making it back."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to put it, the food was wondering but it was just missing something that would make me want to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Carne Asasa tacos were so good I have nothing to show for it lol cute place. Super mom and pop. Definitely hook back for more."}
{"text":"Yelp has done it again!  I would have never tried this place without all of the amazing reviews. This is my first time here but definitely not my last.  The flavors are complex and my meal was absolutely amazing.  All of their salsas were incredible, and I am very particular.  This is worth a drive; it's that good.  

I went back for a second time, and it was just as delicious as the first.  I snapped a picture of the amazing salsa selection for you to check out.  The salsas taste just as good as they look."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie. Im fat, I love to eat and after being at the Crab shack I wanted some tacos so I came to this place and damn, I was surprise with how good the food is. little family own restaurant. I had the asada quesadilla en My buddies had tacos and all was more than we expected."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here and it was delicious! I had a quesadilla and it was the best I've ever had, also the licuado de mango was full of flavor and made to perfection, can recommend this place to anyone looking for some AUTHENTIC Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything is so fresh and delicious.. This was our first time here and we loved it! Great customer service and so many different choices. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow. So glad we stopped here. Got off a flight and needed good food. Found this based on yelp reviews and so happy. Great, fresh food. Nice owner at the counter, clean place. Go here."}
{"text":"Hands down best Tortas in the southwest. I am born in raised in Tucson and my family cooks food Sonoran style so I know good Mexican food.  This is undeniably the best tortas in the state.   My recommendation is the torta de alambre!!!!!!"}
{"text":"DTPhx is known for great eats. Don't skip this gem. Chalkboard simplified menu does not skip on flavor. Sampled Alambre de asada torta, tacos (asada, pastor, pollo). Torta was perfect soft bread and stuffed. Street tacos my fave was pastor, all were flavorful. Chips are served warm and a good salsa bar. This place offers agua fresca, liquados and home made tortillas. I would come back to try cochinita pibil (not available that day) and something new. Very friendly service and clean eatery-"}
{"text":"For tortas this place offers some tasty and authentic tortas. Would highly recommend the torta Hawaiiana."}
{"text":"\"El Guero\" does a great job of bringing the torta to our side of the border. Make sure that your meal includes something with Milanesa and make sure you wash it down with some of their great horchata.  The original location on 16th street serve the best tortas, the other locations lag behind slightly."}
{"text":"Carne Asada torta = mmmmmmmm! So yummy! I saw someone's review that says the tortas come with Ruffles, yes, they do... And it totally makes the sandwich. I think the balance is awesome with crunchy, spicy, etc. 

Make sure you get everything on it, if you don't, don't bother going. Also, ask for jalepenos and spicy carrots. 

The tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good. I went to Mexico City in May 2010 and this is as close to the real thing that I can find in Phoenix. 

I also love that the owners are sometimes the cooks!"}
{"text":"Okay so theres a time in a persons life where they like to have choices.. lots and lots of choices.. well living in the southwest choice is abundant, so much so that the lists can be pages long when it comes to food and drink. Its really overwhelming!

The Mr and I like to take weeknight foodie plunges. Generally on weeknights I'm slaving over a hot wok, comal or grill while the Mr 'works' late, just managing to show up just in time to eat (life seems so unfair doesn't it?)! So when he got home last night and didn't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night. 

We both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich. We've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called Andreoli's but for some reason I thought they close early. So then I was up to bat.. torta's! Oh yeah and I saw a write up in the New Times last week for a place on 16th Street. So we piled into the Honda and headed west.

This place is only a few blocks south of the famed Bario Cafe. Inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance. Inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman (think Uma Thurman) cleaning off the tables. She was the nicest person I had met in some time! She walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions. We finally ordered 2 torta's and a quesadilla (a gurl has got to eat!)! She then invited us to their salsa bar.. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers. Oh, beware.. the salsa's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome! 

The tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla.. the Mr bit into his Pastor (4.99) and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation. Large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted. On to my Cubana (5.90).. This bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside.. ham, roast pork, milaneza, cheese, lettuce and mayo. Whew, it was good good good. 

As we were noshing through the torta's the quesadilla caught my eye. It looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges.. so seductive, enticing.. fresh. I had to take a bite!  Yeah babe, you're so good. The Alambre (4.99) is filled with onions, cheese, beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla.. this alone was worth the drive! The texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish! This paired nicely with the Horchata (1.99)..  silky smooth and not overly sweet.

I guarantee next week when the Mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner!"}
{"text":"The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.

Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.
 
The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).

The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.

The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.

As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).

The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.

The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.

I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.

For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. 

Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).

The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.

Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late."}
{"text":"The best tortas in the state! Tortas piquime is aiight but the ones Gustavo serve here at Guero are the supreme!! Pierna del puerco with extra avocado is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Ambience: medium sized restaurant with a new age urban feel. Appears to be a family run restaurant with the Three generations of the family almost always present (grandparents, parents, and little children), which only gives it that much more of an authentic Mexican restaurant 

Food: Tortas here are THE BEST in Phoenix. Fresh bread tops generous portions of fresh well prepared meats and veggies. Not your typical tired fatty/sloppy tortas that you may be used to at other Mexican restaurants.

Service: excellent. You can tell they take pride in their food. You usually will be served by the grandparents or the parents with a genuine smile.

Price: it's a bit pricey for a torta but honestly it's a bargain for the fresh factor."}
{"text":"I found this place as we explored Phoenix.  It was pretty good.  Seemed to be a family operated business.  I tried the mini chicken torta. It came with fries.  The torta was very tasty and although it was small, it was pretty filling.  It had plenty of chicken and soft bread.  I didn't see the layer of beans, but I didn't miss them.  The fries were nothing spectacular and I didn't receive too many.  My son had the carne asada quesadilla.  It was excellent!  Tons of meat and cheese.  All in all, it was a winner."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and was so impressed. Went half-and-half with a buddy on tortas and both were delicious--couldn't decide which I liked better. I'm a sucker for salsa bars, and this one was first rate--\"only\" 8 choices, but all of them were quite good. Add on exceptionally friendly service and great value (good-sized sandwich with fries for $8), and I will be back here. Often. Replacing Los Reyes as my valley torta of choice."}
{"text":"Still amazing!  Best guacamole in town.  Best tortas in town.  Three of us got the Cubana, alambre, and aguacate with every kind of taco on the menu.  It was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Best tortas in the valley. Best torta I've ever had actually! We usually get the Alambre de pollo or Alambre de asada. Other sandwiches are really delicious as well. Lots of meat and vegetables, fresh slices of avocado, and comes with fries on the side.

The owners seem like the nicest people. It's run by a family. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm just leaving (not driving) in the car, I couldn't wait to write this review! 
This family owned and ran establishment is fantastic! The lady running the cash register was so sweet and very helpful! 
We were with a group of 7 total. We got a variety of the tortas, sides of beans and the tortilla chips! 
The beans and the tortilla chips were great!! The variety of salsas was awesome!! 
I had the Milanase de pollo torta! Phenomenal! It had thinly pieces of fried chicken with green chilies, avocado, tomato and mayo. The bread was so soft! But nicely crispy on the inside. The chicken was awesome! My dad had some of mine and LOVED it. 
There are three sizes of sandwiches you can get. Mini, regular and large. Everything was just great here! Everyone liked their meals and I can't wait to bring other family here and try the burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Don't let the humble outside fool you. 
Inside is a warm welcoming modern place with food to die for. My husband and I drive from Mesa to come here on the weekends if I don't end up bringing tortas home with me for dinner, which he wishes happened more often. I also eat here fairly frequently during the work week as well since in work in downtown phx.
Lovely family run place, and they are always smiling and very welcoming. I would recommend taking a look at the website to get a more detailed descriptions of the food as the menu board is short and sweet for those who know their choices already.  
I have never once had a less than amazing torta from this place. The Milaneza de Res is my favorite (add cheese and its even better!) followed closely by the classic Cubana. My husband isn't the biggest fan of french fries in general but he craves these fries because of how well done they are. 
The small salsa bar is also killer. Be prepared to experiment and enjoy the surprises, tho the food hardly NEEDS it. 
The only downside is it can be a bit pricey but it is so worth the money."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, at first try I thought \"meh\".  Second try \"mmm\".  Third try\" YES\"!  Every visit we have been greeted with a smile and asked how our day is going.  Top that off with speedy service and quality ingredients and you have a winner.  
I recommend the milanesa de res and add an egg.  I have yet to try the tacos but Guero's is a tortas shop after all."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Very simple menu. Food was amazing!

Had the Cubana Torta and al pastor taco special. Food was well priced and tasted great. They have a salsa bar which was great to add spice and flavor to the food."}
{"text":"Coming from a San Diegan who has good Mexican food around me all the time, this is a must visit. Small family owned restaurant with not too much on the menu (which is good for easier decisions). Everyone was nice and courteous and food came out hot and amazing taste. Well done"}
{"text":"So delicious and so quick. These are the nicest people ever. Couldn't recommend more. I had their veggie torta, it was really filling and fresh"}
{"text":"Chips and Guacamole is an ABSOLUTE must!!! Yes it's expensive but so worth it! Tortas are damn delicious too. Carna Asada and the Carne Asada with bacon....I forget the name. Street tacos are pretty good too...we go back often."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their Tortas are delicious, personally I am a fan of the Milanesa and the shaved pork leg. The family that owns Tortas El Guero is so nice. I always feel very welcome when I go."}
{"text":"What a really good sandwich. I enjoyed it. Very nice hearty filling sandwich. One of the best I have ever had would def come again. Nice people too."}
{"text":"Arrived TEG a little after 4pm.  Since we were going out later, we both decided to get something small. We each wanted the small torta.  They were out of the small buns so we shared a medium size Torta.
We wanted to Milanese's  d pollo and they were out of that too.  Based on the closing hour, 6 PM, this must be a great lunch place. We settled on the pollo torta.  The food came quickly.  The Torta was very good and fell apart as we were eatng it.  Nice ripe slices of avocado and large pieces of chicken breast.  The fries were freshly made and good.  Staff are friendly and the place is clean. Lots of seating. The cost for a torta is competitive to other torta eateries."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best tortas in Phoenix hands down. The service is great, and the drinks are pretty good too. I recommend this place to anyone looking to try some awesome Mexican food."}
{"text":"Their tortas are the best I've ever had.  They are made fresh right in front of you and the bread is toasted really well unlike most torta places.  Still, this is the 3rd time I've come to this restaurant to find it closed.  It's like they don't want (or perhaps don't need) any business.  It's Mother's Day so I guess they are spending time with their moms.  They are probably eating at another restaurant, a restaurant with sense enough to accept a lot of business on Mother's Day.   2 stars for the unreasonable business hours which just makes me very frustrated.  I'd give it 4 stars but I just can't take the closing at 4:00 pm on Sundays and 7PM the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Mmm mm mmm love this place.  I usually get the tacos.  But the tortas are fantastic too!  Beans and rice are legit...can't ask for more."}
{"text":"While sitting in my office around lunch time, not sure what I was in the mood for, I opened up my handy Yelp app on my iPhone to see what restaurants were in the area.  Tortas El Guero came up and had an overall 4 star rating.  Figured I'd give it a try, been a while since I had a torta.

Drove over, ordered the Carne Asada torta, paid the $7.09 charge, waited less than five minutes and it was ready in the to go bag.  At first it appeared very small in the bag, but upon opening I discovered it was of normal torta size.  

Got back to the office, drizzled the hot sauce they included in my bag on it, and inhaled the thing in about three minutes.  It was pretty good.  Not the best though.  The best torta I've had would have to be from Los Reyes De La Torta.  I don't know what that means in English, but that place sure is the king of the torta!"}
{"text":"i was highly disappointing in my visit to el guero. i ordered a torta and drink, first it came with like 8 french fries, i was for one pretty ok with that because i really dislike fries but lets say i did, that portion would be worthless, almost insulting for the $14 i paid for the meal. along with that i ordered  the middle size torta and it was still very small compared to surrounding restaurants and it was mostly bread, no meat or cheese. 

that all being said the staff was great, wish their food and portion was as good as the service,"}
{"text":"Today, must be the 10th time I've been here. I Efing love this torta shop! From the adorable little family who run it, to the delicious (and dangerously generous) tortas there is nothing to not like. I often take my employees for a quick bite. We always leave wanting to come back more often."}
{"text":"AMAHZING!!!!!!!

So good. 

Place is clean, courteous and food is the BOMB. Me gusta mucho!"}
{"text":"Lived in AZ my whole life. Easily some of the best Mexican food I've ever experienced.  A father and his sons sitting near us -- we heard one of the sons repeatedly saying \"this is the best damn torta I've ever had!\"  I had the best damn asada torta, too.  The misses loved her street tacos: cochinita, pastor, and asada.  Very reasonable prices, clean, comfortable atmosphere, and some damn good food. One of our new go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that I had a set of Mexican Grandparents, until I stepped into this modest looking haven of fine Tortas.

These things are made with as much love as a mother gives to her newborn baby, and that's no understatement!

I have visited this location on three separate occasions within the past year while waiting for my tires to be serviced across the street.

Upon each visit, I was greeted with a sincere, unbiased, smile that could only come from the heart of a grandparent who was just grateful for each day of life and who got their joy from making others happy by cooking them a meal that only a grandmother is capable of concocting.

From the sweet little voice that takes your order, to the smiling grandpa in the kitchen who makes each Torta or Taco to your liking, you can't help but feel the love in this place, despite the not so attractive surrounding businesses. It really does feel like you're visiting your innocent grandparents who live in a not so hot neighborhood.

Now onto the food that can't help but soak up all of that love that surrounds it.

Today, I ordered the Torta Al Pastor. If you aren't familiar with Al Pastor style meat, which is most commonly associated with pork, you need to do a little research, because you are in for a real treat! I would consider Al Pastor style to be the Mexican version of what Rednecks call BBQ Style. This torta would be the Mexican equivalent to a pulled pork sandwich.

From the warm, lightly toasted bread that is classically used with Tortas, to the light mayo, the Avocado, shredded lettuce, thin pickled green Chile's, thin sliced tomato, marinated pork in the Al Pastor seasonings, the love is in every bite of this beauty. 

I'm not big on bread, and sub sandwiches just have way too much bread that take away from the flavor of the quality parts of the sub sometimes. The Mexicans really outdid us with the Torta. When a torta is made fresh and properly by an experienced set of Mexican old timers who love to see people smile when they eat their food, it's something that will put any hot sub in town to shame!

If you aren't a fan of swine, don't be alarmed, there are many other selections, and yes the do have a Torta Carne Asada for the unadventurous Weditos.. ;)

Don't be such a Wedito and go try something different, I can assure you that regardless of the torta at this location, you will not be dissatisfied, and I promise that you will feel like you are eating at your Mexican Grandparents place...

While you are in this place, help them unlock their business on Yelp. They are like most other grandparents and technology has run right past them.

This place could use some business, and I know that others out there who are like myself, always love to know of random little places that may not look so hot from the street, but are a real treat once you break through those doors.

Can't wait to start seeing some more reviews on this place, it deserves some Yelp attention!

Cheers and Salute! ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious, cute clean place.  Seriously overstuffed street tacos are $2.50 each.  Good salsa bar with hot fresh chips.  Pretty fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously...you just need to eat here! Hand down the best tortas in town, keeping it simple and serving with fresh hot french fries and a great assortment of salsas. Stop reading this review already. You should be ordering your torta by now!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here after the Fiesta Bowl parade.  This is an outstanding place to stop to eat.  The Cubano torta was great with lots of meats, avocado, and veggies.  The fries were fresh, hot, and perfect.  My wife had the carne asada quesadilla and it was one of the best that we have had in Phoenix.  The side of guacamole and sour cream top it off just right.  We had the chips as well and they were fresh, hot, and perfect.  Met the owners and it is definitely a family run restaurant.  The place was very clean, friendly, and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was in here today because I was searching for subs on yelp. I saw that there are pretty high reviews so decided to stop in. I walked in and saw the chalkboard menu and noticed that the torta is pretty pricey (reg for $8 something). I still ordered an Alambre torta just to try it and ordered an horchata. 

After sitting down and waiting for my food, the owner/cashier walked to me and said that the horchata will take 10 mins so I asked her what else she recommends. She suggested the coconut one so I trusted her and went with it. 

The food and drink came and I just noticed all the avocado that they put into my torta. I was happy with it because it was a pretty good amount. The coconut agua was really good as well! I liked every single bite I took of the torta. The fries was the only thing that only tasted okay, but that was fine with me. Although the torta looks small, it was very filling. 

Overall, the service was awesome and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm stepping into the dining room of my long-lost Mexican family. Such a friendly husband/wife team. 

The food: amazing! They season everything just right and are always sure to ask how you prefer your level of spiciness. The bread they use for the tortas is delish. The prices are way lower than I would expect for food this yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Most delicious Tortas in phoenix! I got the Cubana and it literally took me back to Mexico. By far the best. I recommend this place to everyone. We live in East Mesa and we make the drive anytime we crave a torta. Everyone there was so polite."}
{"text":"One of the best tortas I've had in Phoenix! Friendly staff AMAZING horchata! 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"7/01/10

I've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)  

Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.

(I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT! The food is delicious and fresh. The family that owns it is wonderful. The place is always clean. It is a no frills joint, the classic \"hole in the wall.\" The Torta Cubana is to die for. Their carne asada and pastor are rediculously good, too. I have taken 10 different people here in the last 2 months and they all loved it. Even an atheist would tell ya that there is a lil piece of heaven in every bite."}
{"text":"Holy crap this is delicious! Had the Torta al Pastor and it was so good! The meat was the perfect flavor and texture, the salsas all had a great kick. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"What has happened to my beloved Tortas El Guero?

I have been eating here for about a year or more, and over the last 2 months I have noticed a discernable difference in the taste and quality of the torta. It has managed to get smaller, and less flavorful nearly everytime I've been there recently, and whereas before I would have a craving for Tortas and would run to El Guero, now I find myself searching for other lunch time eateries. 

I know the economy has been tough on all of us, and I hope that Tortas El Guero can recover. I will continue to go back here to check up on the wonderul owners and eat their food, I just hope it goes back to it's old ways sooner than later..."}
{"text":"I FINALLY tried this place after a year of driving by it almost every day.  I got the Alambre torta to go. It was out for me in about five minutes while I got two salsas from the salsa bar.  The owners were super nice and the place was very clean.

I'm not religious, but hand on my heart, I got gospel to share.  The moment I bit into that torta, I knew it had delivered me.  And you know what? It's going to save y'all too.

I need every Yelper who is on this page during their hours of operation to do one thing.  Stop reading this website and get your a** to Tortas el Guero.  I know you're hungry, boo.  I see you browsing the food porn.  Guess what?  You just found what you need. Go get it already.  You deserve it, and these people deserve all the dollars.

'Nuff said, I got sammiches to eat. ::Mic drop::"}
{"text":"Everytime I've entered this place to eat Ive endulged in fine mexican cuisine. Yuuuum"}
{"text":"I don't even know how I stumbled upon this place, but I've been hooked ever since. Is run by what seems to be the cutest family. Surprisingly nice inside. Truly the best tortas in town (and I'm sure their other food is great too!)."}
{"text":"The service alone gets my 5 stars! As soon as we walked in everyone greeted us like they knew us! Made us feel very welcome. 

We ordered the carne asada torta & the chicken one... They were served with a side of fries! Food was delicious and the horchata made it 100% better! Too bad I goobled it before taking a picture.

I'm from Los Angeles so we yelped this place and it was well worth it! The area is not the best-est but the food will make u forget where u are ;) 

Come take a taste!"}
{"text":"Best Tortas ever ! The guacamole&fries Woah ;) Friendly people,the moment you walk in you feel welcomed....I will definitely come and eat here more often.."}
{"text":"I just went to Tortas El Guero for the first time today, and it is a MUST TRY for those of you who like diving elbow deep into delicious tortas.  I have lived in Phoenix for almost four years now and although I am devoted to my favorite torta source in my hometown, San Diego, this place rocks.  Also, when I gave my compliments to the folks behind the counter, the owners came out and introduced themselves, asked me my name, and thanked me for coming.  Definitely go to Tortas El Guero.  I'll be back for the good food and friendly, neighborhood service.  XO to Tortas El Guero!"}
{"text":"I love the tortas at Tortas El Guero. They are delicious!!! 

A torta is a Mexican sandwich and this place makes the best!!! I like to wash one down with a cup of horchata. Yum! 

It gets pretty busy at noon, so make sure to go for an early or late lunch."}
{"text":"Great place the Cubana torta was awesome really tasty and the place is. Ice clean and great service"}
{"text":"The best Pastor in town. Either in a taco or one of their huge tortas, it's heaven. Besides being very friendly and welcoming, the food is first rate."}
{"text":"Amazing food, warms my heart and soul!!! It's a MUST TRY!! The Aguas are the real deal! Oh and The salsa bar, yummy!!"}
{"text":"I love Tortas! Tortas are to me, the ultimate sandwich. I was excited when I read all the reviews and was happy to visit for lunch and order to go.
The cashier was friendly, the food was ready in a reasonable amount of time.
I have notice an inconsistency in the amount of meat that will be inside a torta and I am not sure if that depends on who is cooking your food. The last time my torta had a minimal amount of carne asada, which really didn't taste like carne asada, more like carne guisada. I think they can do better in this department, there was too much lettuce in it and I am not a fan of what people like to call \"pico de gallo\" but to me is salsa bandera or salsa fresco in tort as, who cares, bottom line is it doesn't help.

I loved that when I asked for a combination of horchata and agua de pi√±a, they just made it, no questions asked. That was delicious!

I think next time I will eat in, see if that makes a difference, I will also request for no salsa and maybe, if available, pay extra for more avocado.  I will also give their other choices a try, because maybe that's what I am doing wrong.
So next time you want a good sandwich, give Tortas El Guero a try."}
{"text":"They have the best guacamole I have ever had, yummy and fresh! I had the alambre torta and it was delicious!!  Everyone is extremely friendly, they're all family, and the place is super clean and organized. I will definitely be coming back more often now. Worth everything! Muchas Gracias!!!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say here, except that, in a town full of mexican restaurants (some good, many mediocre), these are the best tortas.  And the family who manages it couldn't be nicer every time I go there.

I always recommend this place...I've even taken business clients there, even though it's a order-at-the-counter type of restaurant."}
{"text":"The first torta I ever had was from Tortas El Guero, and they still make my favorite. I like their vegetarian torta, which comes with avocado and queso fresco, and the pastor is also great. I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"okay, this place is a bitt $$ for it's tortas, don't get me wrong, the food is good and the salsa is delicious. i do enjoy this place, and i will be going back. Oh and the staff are very nice and like to make conservation with it's guest."}
{"text":"Still not have found better tacos in the entire state..  must try the pastor special.  Service 5 stars, food..can I give more than 5 stars... I was starting to think Phoenix would never compare to the food in tx...  my favorite place, I'm here once a week at least"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  The food and service were on point.  Fresh ingredients and made to order.  Best sandwich shop hands down.  Their burritos and Aguas frescas were awesome as well"}
{"text":"carne asade tortas are consistently good here. they had other locations but they are closed.

this is their original location and they know what they are doing here."}
{"text":"The staff and s friendly and the owner smiles as he makes the food! Everything here is good and big portions!"}
{"text":"I love their Tacos, they are the best I have ever had! Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I don't really like Mexican food lol but this place was bomb! I only love authentic Mexican food and this was it! The meat was delicious in my Cuban torta it had like three different meats, Mexican cheese and jalape√±os. Soo good. And the horchata must have been homemade as well because it was delicious. And the people that work here are super nice it's like I was a guest at someone's house."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I haven't had one thing I didn't enjoy. Even if you don't live close, this place is worth the drive! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"These guys are family owned, their food is always delicious, and I appreciate the consistency of their product. 

I love their Tortas most of all, but their burritos are also a tasty alternative. 

The atmosphere is casual, grab-and-go, but there is no rush if you want to linger and enjoy your dish. Their ingredients are fresh and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This little gem is kind of hard to find if you don't know where it is. Luckily I live in the neighborhood 
I LOVE the carne asada torta!!! One of the best I've tried. 
Very clean place. Very nice people. 
Every time I go in I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"You can easily drive by this gem on 16th street.  Nice clean modern restaurant, greeted promptly and the staff is extremely nice.  Ordered a mini Asada torta, they didn't have any mini bread so had to get the regular size and glad I did!  The tortas come with French fries or you can ask for tortilla chips instead.  Get the chips because they have a fresh salsa bar available.   The salsa on the far right is on point, I didn't get a chance to try the other flavors.  The asada was delicious, though I love mayo I wish they had some other kind of sauce on it that had more kick.  Generous portion of meat and avocado, lettuce mayo, grilled onions.  Really enjoyable to eat.  Hubs got the cubano which is a shredded pork, didn't get the opportunity to try it, but he enjoyed it as well.  We will definitely return, can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I absolutely am a fan of this place.

Cheap prices great food and a clean atmosphere. I love the Cuban Torta. Order one up with a Mexican Coke and you should be in good shape."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love picking up Tortas El Guero as it is just up the street from where we live. The interior is warm and welcoming and I love supporting a family run business, especially when three generations of the family are typically working when we visit. 

I usually order 3 Pastor Tacos. The meat is always nicely caramelized and has a great flavorful marinade. It is topped with either raw or pickled onions and cilantro which adds a nice refreshing crunch. My husband usually orders the Milanesa Torta and has always been satisfied. I especially enjoy the salsa bar.

My only wish is that they would include a rice bowl or some type of salad on their menu.

The quality of the food is always excellent for the price. We eat here at least twice a month and have always had a sincerely warm welcome."}
{"text":"Muy rico !!!! Service and staff very friendly and the Tortas are delish!!! Got Cubana torta and it was very fresh and rico."}
{"text":"Ahh tortas..  Had my first taste when I worked in Downtown LA.  The ones here are even better.  This was my first visit in about 6 months.  Forgot how good they are.  I had the Carne which is always a solid choice.  I took a co-worker who was a bit reluctant at first, but seemed to really enjoy the spicy pork.

Also, they have a munch of flavors of horchata, and Coca Cola with real sugar."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The service is fantastic. The restaurant is very clean. What more could you ask for. 

I look forward to trying everything on their menu and sharing good conversation with friends while doing it."}
{"text":"Fantastic tortas!  And very clean and pleasing eat-in dining area.  Great for a quick lunch.  The owner is friendly and welcoming.  Home cooked feel."}
{"text":"Tons of choices, many tasty options. Do NOT get the largest one. I ate it for three days and I'm a 200lb. male. Some employees don't speak English well, so brush up on your Spanish restaurant phrases before you go in."}
{"text":"Never again will I go somewhere else for a torta. I started coming here when my friend took me and I was amazed on how delicious the cubana torta is. This is your \"hole in the wall\" place you're looking for, trust me. ORDER THE CUBANA, it'll change your torta world."}
{"text":"Really helpful service, and the tortas are insanely good. Tacos top notch as well. Bacon in the al pastor. Yum."}
{"text":"You gotta love a family owned place that just gets it right. The tortas are fantastic. They load up the meat and avocado which balance one another. I could not recommend this place enough. My favorite changes constantly between the cochinita, al pastor, Cubano, and Carne Asada."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in AZ! Tortas are yummy too. Friendly staff. I have gone there several times."}
{"text":"Great tortas! I've missed tortas. On our first trip, won't be our last, we had the carne asada tortas. The meat was seasoned well and tender. The buns were soft and delicate. Avocado is always a must in a torta and they had plenty of avocado. The torta was so good it didn't even need the fries it came it with. The torta wasn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. It was great how it was! They also have a nice salsa bar. I love avocado salsa, delicious. We also ordered a melon agua. It had been ages since we had aguas. (Being in Miami for so long, there is lack of good Mexican food lol). The melon agua was delicious as well. Nice, chilled and sweet. Nice little place to come check out. I recommend you guys try it. The employees there are super nice! Great customer service."}
{"text":"I went here with a buddy of mine on a workday lunch break. I must admit, my expectations were low, so I was overall happy with the experience. I had the spicy pork combo (sandwich and fries) and a Horchata to drink. A quick, fast foody type place, but much better than a burger king or carls for a lunch break. I'll be back, but I noticed the location closest to my house on 40th st has been closed."}
{"text":"Legitimately family owned place. I am pretty sure there are three generations of owners in the place at any one time.

The tortas are really good. The bread is soft and fresh and the salsa bar is gigantic. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for lunch with a few other guys from work, and none of us have ever had a disappointing meal! We have been working our way down the menu of delicious tacos, Tortas and other great items, and find ourselves already planning the next visit to try another amazing dish. Everything is fresh and expertly made with the care of a good family-owned restaurant. Everyone there is very nice and inviting. If you like sauces and salsas, than you can't get better than here! I have tried them all, but usually end up back at the awesome green sauce! I would recommend (and have recommended) this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada and Cochinta tacos were awesome and had great flavor. The Limon drink was really refreshing. Overall this is a great mom and pop to eat at."}
{"text":"Pretty good darn torta's! Most usually comes with guacamole slices.  Ingredients seem fresh too!  If you do stop by, get the hot guacamole salsa, it's blended really well and has a kick! Apply it onto your tortas! so good! Wash it down with a can of Coke, seems to go really well with it.

The menu seem to have slimmed down over the past few times I've gone, so that's why I have given them a 3-star, otherwise a 4."}
{"text":"Best tortas!

The menu is pretty diverse.  Just about every torta can also come in burrito or taco form as well. There is enough meat on one taco for two!

Great family run place where everyone pitches in.  On different occasions, I've seen the husband, grandfather, and grandmother in the kitchen.

A little while ago they switched from chips to fries... personally, I liked the chips better because they dip in the salsas easier... and speaking of salsas, watch out for the green stuff! It looks like guac but will knock your socks off."}
