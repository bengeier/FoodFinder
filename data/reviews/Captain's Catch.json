{"text":"amazing oysters. So fresh. Welcoming and friendly staff. price is pretty good as well. Definitely worth 5 stars. I am going to recommend it to my friends for sure."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant in the area. No MSG (I'm quite sensitive to msg usually) and prices are fair for the quality of food they provide. Lunch prices are unbelievably affordable and is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good environment. Decent service. While there is no congee when I went there one month ago.  Food is good. Prices are ok."}
{"text":"Daytime soup noodle: 2/5
Regular stir fry: 4/5

I actually came a lot, just for some Cantonese stir fry to dine in or to go. They accept both Apple Pay and wechat pay. Convenient to local people and friendly to FOB. Nice staff, good taste. Small portion which is excellent for me. I thought it's a 3.5~4/5 restaurant, and a good choice if you don't want to cook everyday. Walking distance to neighborhood.

Today is the first time I came for daytime noodle soup, it's below mediocre. If I rate Deer Garden 5/5, this is definitely a 1.5+/5, but due to their location and nice staff, I gave it a 2/5. Their chicken wings (come with noodle soup) are weird, not something you are expected. Beef slice has zero taste, saying that I always ask for \"less salt less oil no msg\" to most Chinese restaurant.
They do need to provide customer a big spoon for noodle soup.

I will still come for their stir fry , but not for noodle soup."}
{"text":"This is my first time here,Since they reopened,The food is very good,(delicious i must say.Service was excellent,And courteous,I had the general Tao chicken with rice & vegetables,With a spring roll, spicy as it should be.
Comes with soup and a pop,For $7.99 Lunch special,and they give you a lot of food for that price,
I recommend you try it,You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Staff was accommodating on a weeknight. We ordered the menu for 10-12 people and were escorted to a private room lol. Lobster/crab dishes seemed fresh and flavours were pretty good too. Steamed fish was not so good. Parking could be a challenge on a busy night."}
{"text":"The steamed fish was very fresh and tasty. The soya sauce and texture of the fish was good.  The lobster was fresh. The peas was not bad, it can be more flavourful. The tea they serve was very nice, it is of higher quality. My mom is very picky with chicken, but even she enjoyed it. Besides from the limited parking. The overall experience was good. We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a group dinner...set menu. I found the food fresh and tasty and the service was attentive.

We had both the king crab and lobster. I liked the roasted garlic they were cooked in both tasty with a kick

Pay cash for additional discount.

Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Bought the pad Thai lunch special for take out. When I went to pick it up, the lady was on the phone for 15 minutes without even acknowledging my existence. Every lunch special dish is suppose to come with a spring roll.....but I didn't get one at all. The soup tastes like sewage water. But overall it's cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place may well be cursed, as they have changed hands at least 4-5 times since i've been around this year. this place has replaced another previous chinese restaurant called congee pheonix. i have to say although they changed very little of the decor. the menu has improved slightly in terms of the combo deals. however ordering separately in this restaurant is a money grab at best. they are very pricey for a chinese restaurant, even pricier then congee queen. the food i have to say is standard and average at best, nothing spectacular. the portions aren't amazing, but what really bumped them to a lower 2 star, is the fact that this restaurants services is beyond terrible. even though there was no one waiting and there is a hostess. in the beginning of entering took the hostess a total of 10 minutes to acknowledge us and get us a table. even thought there were clearly plenty of empty spots. Once we got to the table it was a struggle to get any services, from having to get tea, to getting the menu and finding someone to order with. basically i felt like we were begging to eat here. for the price they want to charge for food, they should at least have better service, or better food. non of which is the case. i would not recommend this to anyone, as it is not worth the hassle. or the money to spend here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and pricing is competitive with other lunch special offerings.  Service is very good-polite and efficient.  The decor is nice and they also have a few VIP rooms for private gatherings.   Food (can only comment on the lunch specials but I expect dinner to be similar) is quite good...Frankly how can you differentiate your food unless it's really good or bad???   If it's fresh, competitively price, decent portions and tastes good.  I typically rate it a 4/5.

The only potential issue here is parking since they share the parking with a very busy Tim Hortons.  The good news is that the turnover of cars at Tims is quite fast.   At least they have taken steps to fix the parking issue since they have free parking next door at Parkway Car Wash after 630pm M-Sat and all day on Sundays.   This is really important for dinner and I glad they were proactive enough to fix this issue."}
{"text":"Came in for my mother's birthday. We had fried rice, deep fried crab balls, lobster, and steamed veggies. Everything was absolutely delicious, especially the lobster! The one criticism that I have about the Captain's Catch is the service - we felt like we were being ignored at certain times during our experience here...although it was busy when we came in, I wish they were more attentive, especially when they were giving me eye contact back when I tried to get their attention..."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 

First Impressions
=============
Walked into the reception area where there was a table that seemed to be where the cashier/host was.

No welcome or greeting or any acknowledgement of my existence whatsoever.  But... sadly this is something I've come to expect from Chinese Seafood restaurants, especially if you look younger than a baby boomer.

Food
====
The food was a little on the bland side, and that was consistent across all the dishes.

We had: 
- Chicken (in a soy sauce & green onions \"sauce\"): the chicken was okay.  Parts were a bit tuff and dry.
- Steamed fish (in soy sauce): probably the best of the bunch we had.  On the bland side even though the base sauce is soy sauce.
- Stir Fried baby bak Choi in garlic sauce: it was absent of garlic and salt...:/

Service
======
- Again sadly I think I've gotten use to this but they seem to treat larger tables with better service.

It felt like they were indifferent whether or not you enjoyed your time/food at the restaurant and whether you'd be back or not.

Will I be back?
===========
They don't seem to care either way, so no--no thank you."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give this place a zero! Worst Asian restaurant I've ever been too! The food is disgusting, they even messed up the squid legs with tons of salt. The shrimp chow main was the most nasty chow main I have ever had! Im from an Asian area and I've had amazing food. This place is HORRIBLE! DO NOT GO HERE!!! PS: The service is horrible too."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a weeknight around 9:30pm, service kind of slow with the restaurant being pretty empty at that time, but otherwise pleasant. Ordered Lobster E-Fu Noodles & Spicy Lettuce. Noodles were not bad, with decent amount of lobster for 2 people (not huge marble pieces, but good enough). Lettuce was large portion and flavourful.

The best part of the meal was the unexpected complimentary dessert - \"snow fungus\" that night - very soft, sweet and smooth."}
{"text":"Very competitive pricing.  Huge portions.  I was actually quite surprised on how big some of the portions were.  Portion size I feel must be highlighted here.  HUGE.  The oysters are huge, well depends in which size u order since there are 2 sizes.  Will definitely return.  Food quality is good.  Everything was decent.  Staff was friendly.  Your teapot is always full and your empty plates are taken away promptly.  They also clear off your bones plate when it reaches half full.  They don't pressure you to get anything in particular, which is nice since quite a few Cantonese restaurants try to sell u on the more expensive items on the menu, but not this place which is good.  Thing I didn't like was their noodle in soup which is only served up to 5pm... The noodles looked like they were overcooked and had absorbed a lot of the soup...so tasted kinda bad...had to leave that one to waste but everything else was good.  Restaurant is quite new and the decor was above average for the typical Cantonese restaurant especially for the pricing.  They take credit card which is not the case for every chinese restaurant so that's another plus.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Horrible on many levels.  Firstly our server was extremely rude.  We were a group of 13 people so when we asked for separate bills our server began to scream in Cantonese.
Next, I ordered a braised tofu and vegetables dish.  The flavour was bland and really not good.  It was not a soup or stew and yet it was floating in 2 inches of brown water.
Lastly, the waitress stood over each one of us separately and told us that the tip was not included in the price.  I said Thank you and expected her to go away.  She repeated that tip wasn't included insisting I give her the tip right then.  I did and then left...never to return!!!"}
{"text":"I was weary of trying this place after seeing some negative reviews on Yelp. But my sister insisted that  when she tried it her and her husband enjoyed the lobster. We came for a family dinner and ordered off the set menu H for 4-6 people for about $198. It came with soup, steamed oysters, snow peas, 5 lb of lobster (although they charge you extra like other places for any extra weight), sautéed clams, steamed fish, lobster roe fried rice and half a chicken. 

One thing I was a bit annoyed at, we tried to get a different style lobster (outside of the set menu) and changing it to the Malaysian style cost us an additional $10. I understand a set menu is a set menu for a reason, but to charge $10 for a flavor change is a bit intense. Other than that, service was  ok, dinner room was very busy around 6-6:30 and I felt a little rushed towards the end of our dinner."}
{"text":"Loved it so much the first time, we came back! I originally had the Cantonese Chow Mein and Congee here. I had to doggy bag the how me in and was surprised that it tasted amazing the next day. The noodles were not stale tasting and after reheating it tasted like it was just made. I've had Cantonese chow mein before from many other places and the leftovers almost always tasted stale the next day.

I'm here today to try the Japanese style eel with fried rice. I'll write more later!"}
{"text":"Went with two friends.  We had two seafood noodle dishes and one vegetable dish.  Food was plentiful and \"fine\".  Not very flavourful.  Menu was satisfactory.  Prices were average."}
{"text":"This place uses to be called Congee Phoenix, a slightly cozy and affordable Chinese restaurant, but after a fire destroyed the roof and kitchen they decided to renovate and transform their restaurant style and prices as a result rose up quite a bit.  

The quality has not changed much compared to before, I would give Congee Phoenix 4 stars for the food and service, but to raise the price and serve the same EXACT food after simply saying now you serve lobster and king crab? I'm sorry that doesn't make sense to me.  

If you're somehow craving for Chinese-style lobster and large plates for rice/noodles, I suppose this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"This was the second time that I have been to this restaurant.
Another great meal, the HK style of cooking tastes just as I had it in HK a few months ago. The chef is excellent and comparable to any higher end restaurant in Toronto.

We ordered the steamed free range chicken - excellent.
Beef ribs  - which came with more vegetables than expected.
Steamed Bass cooked perfectly.
Pork with green peppers - which also seemed like more vegetables than expected.

The price is slightly higher than you casual dining restaurant.

Décor - The décor is enjoyable, although the middle section makes you think you are not in a spacious restaurant. Choose to sit in the back if you can."}
{"text":"I was expecting having a seafood feast at Captain's Catch. But fresh seafood selection is quite limited. 

We ended up ordering:

?????? ($12.99) Fried Spare ribs in Chinkiang Style - too fatty, 50% of the ribs were fat!

???? ($14.99) Tiger Shrimps in Maggi Sauce - Really tasty and shrimps were well prepared!

????? ($ 5.99 each) Steamed Oysters in Minced Garlic - at $6 a piece, we got 1 big one which was double the size of the other one?! Taste was good but I don't think I will order that again!

I would not consider Captain's Catch is a real \"seafood\" restaurant but a standard Cantonese restaurant. The dish can be a hit or miss. Service is quite attentive and I do like the booth seating and there are quite a few tables available for smaller group.

They do accept credit cards! A pleasant surprise!"}
