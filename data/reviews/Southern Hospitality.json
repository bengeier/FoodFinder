{"text":"I read the reviews of this place and was really excited to check out Southern Hospitality in Edgewood. We arrived around 8 PM on a Saturday night. The very nice lady who was our server took over 10 minutes to take our drink orders (why she didn't take our orders after she finished with the table behind us is a mystery). When she finally brought our glasses of lemonade mix, she took our orders and vanished. 50 minutes or so later, a gentleman comes to our table with our food in plastic bags and to-go containers. He informed us that it was closing time and we needed to leave. The other table, interestingly, was still eating their food and were not told that they had to leave. We were so gobsmacked that we paid and left. The food was uninspired. First of all, they were out of mostly everything and the menu says that they offer chicken breast, but, in reality the only thing they have are wings. The wings were OK but I'm not convinced that they didn't come from Costco. The fish was deplorable, overcooked and fishy. The baked beans were obviously out of a can, as were the yams. I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Southern hospitality is where people go if they like cold, soggy, prison food. It took them 10 minutes to call my number, and when they did, the clerk gave me what looked like something he found in the dumpster outside. 2 chicken wings, and some cold soggy cornbread wrapped in aluminum foil.  They also gave me some cold broccoli with a taste that reminded me of the distinct smell of a bowling alley bathroom. I paid $7.55 for this \"meal\", and I would strongly advise not getting food from this den of thieves."}
{"text":"The food was ok...the service was not so good. They try but they're not organized. I ordered catfish and I think it was whiting but I like whiting so I didn't care. They sold a whole pie to a customer and had none left for dining in customers. I would go back but I think I'd rather have takeout."}
