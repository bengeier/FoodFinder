{"text":"we stopped for dinner tonight. the decor is clean and colorful, dim enough to feel romantic, but bright enough to entertain a child. menu is brief and simple. had the harira soup, chicken kebab, beef kebab and tea service for 3. sitting in the inviting window seats with low tables gives a great survey of the happenings on Lee Road, but hard to eat the soup! perfect for tea and cookies though.

highlights: the green tea with mint is amazing. the service borders on ritual; a lovely way to sit and visit. the kebabs were both very good, and the accompanying salads were fresh, crisp and light, lemony and the perfect portion. while the service is not slow, you will need to embrace the experience of leisurely dining...each dish is made to order, and the freshness is worth it. we did find the harira soup and rice under seasoned, but snuck a little salt and all was well. our daughter actually loved the soup, with a nice chunk of bread to dip.

the chef was very kind and attentive, and we'll be back to try some of the specials, featured from Thursday - Saturday."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! This place looks like a little hole in the wall joint that may not may make you think it's going to anything special but the food is really tasty. The chef (and I presume the owner) takes your order and does a great job answering any questions. The food is fresh, flavorful and unique. I tried the beef kebab sand which . It came with a delicious light side salad with a savory dressing, olives and cheese. The sand which itself wasn't put together as a typical sand which but came with two small rolls of their tasty home made bread and vegetables and the beef in a sauce. I built my own little sand which and it was delicious! And just enough food to fill me up without overdoing it like so many other restaurants out there. My husband wanted to try their French pasty cookies so we got a few of those and they were good as well. Different than your typical cookie, but on point with the overall uniqueness of this gem of a restaurant. Sadly, there was only one other couple in the restaurant dining with us. I hope the word gets out and this place stays in business for a long while so I can come back!"}
{"text":"The east side needs more places like this, which is why I'm writing this review, hoping that people go and support this guy. The food is delicious, fresh, and well-priced. You can really tell that everything is made from scratch since some of the flavors are really nuanced and unlike those found elsewhere (especially the sauces). Go there."}
{"text":"The menu is small and simple but is fantastic. All of the kebob platters are delicious and now they have the lamb special daily. Try the mint tea, Harira soup and a kebob. My only advice would be don't come if you are in a rush since depending on the time of day the chef may be the only one working there. Otherwise it is A+"}
{"text":"Very personal experience. Momo is an amazing host. The food is great, and the service is just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"The ambience,host and simple menu were great. I would give it 5 star if the beef kebabs were not dry. The house salad and mint tea were great!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and well priced! We got one of each platter and they were all delicious. Mint tea is a must and super legit. The guy waiting on us (the owner) was very sweet and talkative and obviously very passionate. I loved this spot, get the cookies too for dessert."}
{"text":"Love it!  Food was fresh and perfectly seasoned starting with the salad.  We had Chicken Kebab and Kefta Kebab.  The saffron basmati rice that came with our platter was light and fluffy. Small, casual place, with super attentive service.  Cookies for dessert were just right.  Can't wait to go back.  Also looking forward to take out.  We look forward to trying the lamb, tagine and specials soon!  Good Vegetarian options. Just delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Small menu but that's because it's a high-quality, small-scale place (just 8 tables). The couscous with beef and vegetables (Friday special) was superb. Last time there was a great Moroccan restaurant in the Heights, it didn't get enough business and closed. This place is just what Cedar-Lee needs, so go try it! Tonight they didn't have lamb-- but it's because the owner didn't like the look of the lamb at the market and wouldn't serve something not up to his standard. Now that's refreshing. Most places do not source so carefully, so I'll look forward to lamb another night."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this one and only Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland! Three of us shared tabouli, beef kabob, chicken kabob, Harira soup, French cookies and hot sweet mint tea. They cook with a wood fired oven that brings a delicious smokey flavor to the food. Even the veggies were cooked in the oven. The bread was divine! The decor was of course very Moroccan with fluffy sofas and several colorful poufs to sit on. Muhammed is a very friendly host. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Everything was just ok - we didn't try the tagine - which is the house specialty and probably the best dish. The vegan couscous had a great spice to it. The tabouli is very fresh and tastes strongly of lemon. The green salads come with a lot of dressing. The chicken kebab was dry. All of it comes with a dense round wheat bread. If we give the place another try we will wait until fall. The air conditioning is very weak so it was hotter inside than outside (on a 90 degree day). Ask for ice in your water on the hot days!"}
{"text":"This is a great option in Cleveland Heights. The owner is very friendly and the food is delicious! Make sure to get the mint tea."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I only give 1 star to this restaurant and this star goes to the nice staff of the restaurant who will bend backwards for customers. I wish the food matched the staff's efforts. Meat was chewy, under or overcooked in certain cases (we came as large group). Rice had no taste at all. Tabbouleh was way to bitter to enjoy. Salads were tasty. I will say that split pea soup was excellent. I believe that the restaurant has great potential because of its location and otherwise excellent Moroccan cuisine. Unfortunately the quality of food is far from good. We came after reading positive reviews but we will not be back there."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back.  Mo was very friendly and the food was phenomenal.  Be sure to stop by and you will leave full and happy!  Kefta was superb!!"}
{"text":"Superb! Try the tagine special on Saturday. The meat is tender and juicy; the plums, raisins and onions add a hint of sweetness. Service is quick and polite. The prices are ridiculously low."}
{"text":"Great food! The chef clearly  takes pride in the food that he makes.The menu has only has a few items on it. However, the food is fresh and delicious! Give this place a try and enjoy a nice chat with the chef while you are at it about Morocco ( the place where he is from)."}
{"text":"On a Sunday night we were looking for someplace yummy to eat and came across this place on yelp. The reviews don't lie it was very very good. The place was cozy and welcoming with an authentic style. We started off with the moroccan tea which was minty and sweet. Then we got the tazine and lamb. Both were different but very good. The meat was not dry very soft and moist also full of spices. We will come back here again. Ohh and the owner is moroccan and he is the cook and makes everything fresh."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and loved the place! The owner himself waited tables and split his time in the kitchen. He speaks English/French/Arabic with customers and is absolutely charming -- apparently he came to the US from Morocco in the early 90's. There's room for maybe 20-30 people max, so it's pretty cozy and perfect for a small family outing or date.

We ordered tabouleh, marinated grilled beef kebab platter, and Tagine lamb (despite what the menu says, it's now offered on Sundays as well). Everything tasted super fresh, and we were served warm bread with our starting salad. The beef kebab was especially tender and delicious, coming with a zesty sauce that had a spicy kick. The Tangine lamb dish comes as a stew and is more of a comfort food -- really loved its presentation in their custom glazed pots.

In addition, we had the Moroccan style green mint tea and it was fantastic! The tea had a strong, rich flavor with a bit of sweetness, and it perfectly complemented our meat dishes. Highly recommend it.

Definitely will return and try some of the sandwiches for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and amazing. We ordered the grilled chicken platter and tea and everything was extremely good. You can tell the food is authentic and the owner is very friendly. This is our third visit in two weeks and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern cuisine I've had in the Cleveland area. 

I had their lamb platter and it came out as bone-in chops, some rice, a few grilled peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers that just melted in the mouth, a delicious spicy sauce and two pieces of a flat bread that when eaten together were just outstanding.

Even the pre dinner salad, an after thought at most places, was amazing here. 

I'm definitely coming back as soon as possible to try more of their offerings. Highest marks."}
{"text":"I have seen MoMo's Kebab for some months and wanted to try it. My son and I dined there tonight and had a great meal. The Moroccan tea was delish and the salads with freshly baked whole wheat bread rolls were very fresh and tasty. My son had the beef kebab and I had the kefta kebab and they were both lovely; the hot sauce was good - spicy without being overwhelming. Both meals came with rice and grilled vegis, and the whole meal was under $25. The chief/owner was very personable and interesting to talk with. I hope his business continues to expand as he explained to us. It was a treat of an evening out and I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic restaurant! Everything about this place was fantastic---small cozy well decorated place, the friendly host/chef, the great value for your meal. And the food was excellent from start finish---don't miss the mint tea or the sweet cookies for dessert. The salad and bread were so fresh. Our entrees were so delicious. One of the best ethnic restaurants in CLE---truly a hidden gem in Cleveland Heights!!! You must try this place!"}
{"text":"MoMo's Kebab is an amazing place. The atmosphere and staff are very inviting and the food is amazing. I had a beef kebab platter (which came with a salad first) and the beef was amazing. I'm not an eggplant lover, but they did something amazing to that veggie. 
And the mint tea was perfect for a cold night!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot.  The food and tea were both delicious, and the owner/operator was very welcoming and kind.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a great time at MoMo's. He was as welcoming a host as a chef. He and his wife operate their restaurant in an eclectic eatery neighborhood. Service and atmosphere was good in this quaint little spot. Mo Mo was quite accommodating for 2 novices who were unfamiliar with their dishes. and funny, taking a moment to go over the dishes. Get the Mint tea  for sure. Check out the menu. Can't go wrong with any items. No complaints here. Tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was top notch and the service was perfect. My first time here and will be back. The warm wheat bread is delicious. Side salad was good but normal. The mint tea is absolutely a reason in itself to visit this restaurant"}
{"text":"If there's one thing people should know about Cleveland, it's that we do have establishments that are culturally enriching. MoMo's is a perfect example of that cultural diversity - a small, cozy restaurant owned by a Moroccan that has distinctive decor and serenades you with Moroccan music. It's the closest you could get to Morocco without a passport and plane ticket!

The interior was clean, with bright colors and painting on the wall that provided a warm, exciting atmosphere. There were small tables and chairs available, as well as two bigger wooden tables that sat lower to the ground and used a comfy looking sofa and squishy chairs as seating. 

The food was amazing! My wife got the grilled beef kebab plate and I went with the lamb kebab plate. They both came with veggies, basmati rice, a side of hot sauce that's made in house, and a Mediterranean salad (which I substituted for a soup that mostly constituted of lentils and chickpeas); we also received a small basket of Moroccan bread. 

It's well documented that we Americans treat eating as a chore but to other cultures it's a social event in and of itself - the food at MoMo's brought a whole new attitude to eating for us. The food was good, but not overly rich - we found ourselves taking smaller bites, talking more throughout our meal, and focusing on how good the food made us feel. It was an amazing change from the way we normally eat, and was only made possible by the combination of atmosphere and food at MoMo's.

The tea was amazing as well - I'm normally not a fan of mint or green tea, but the way the mint green tea here is prepared makes me a fan! The tea is sweetened and the best way I can  describe it is a slightly sweeter taste than spearmint gum. The way it's served is an experience as well. 

The staff was great too - the host/server was nice and open to questions about everything. The chef was incredibly kind and enjoyable to talk too - and also wanted to make sure your questions were answered (ask how the tea is made - it's a process that will make it even more incredible to you). One thing that struck me was that the chef carries your plates out to you and serves them you,so everyone gets to meet who cooked the meal. 

This place exceeded all of our expectations and I highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant on Lee Rd!
I had the Tagine and my significant other had a kebab. I haven't had food that fresh from a restaurant in a long, long time. I would go there everyday just to have that salad! To top it off - the prices are amazing. We both ate for under $30. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was a really good surprise! The food is amazing! I had tagine, the meat was melting in my mouth, the right amount of spice, the vegetables in the side amazing. The music in back makes the place really cozy. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"An authentic Moroccan experience! Start with the mint tea and order the special of the day. If it is beef tajine (like today's lunch), then you're in for a real treat! The owner, Mo will start you off with a crisp salad and warm bread. A few minutes after you're done, he will bring out a traditional tajine earthen pot. Lift the lift and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love MoMo's!! everything is FRESH and made daily. The food is flavorful, the prices are great, the service is friendly, and the Mint Tea is perfect! Definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The mint tea was good, but drink fast because it gets bitter. The lamb was phenomenal. The bread was fresh. The salad was good. Overall a 10/10 meal. Owner was super nice too!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday after church drive down Lee, Momo's Kebab caught our eyes. A quick search on Yelp intrigued my husband and I to venture into the small restaurant where we found a quiet dining room with a few small tables and chairs. The room was clean, with a Mediterranean ambiance, and we were soon greeted by the owner, who I believe makes all of the food as well! There is a story about his travels and his passion for cooking on the menu. We could tell this man puts his heart and soul into his food and his restaurant and takes great pride in his work. Of course, with this approach to cooking, the food was absolutely incredible. Freshly prepared warm whole wheat bread was brought to the table. Everything on the menu looked great so we ordered a little of everything. We both ordered one of the two soup options. I don't remember what it was called, but it had lots of lentils and vegetables. It was very nice, perfect portion, perfect temperature, and flavorful. We both ordered beef kebab and received a side salad with the order. All of the vegetables in the salad were very crisp and fresh. The dressing was homemade. For a complimentary salad that came with our meal, this went above and beyond. Now let me rave about the beef kebabs! They were really wonderful as well! The meat was tender, juicy, not tough or dry as in some Mediterranean restaurants. It was a little spicy, which I enjoyed. It came with rice, grilled vegetables, and salsa. It was a perfect portion with beautiful presentation and excellent flavors. Also, we really loved the hot green tea! We both shared one pot. It was very high quality green tea brewed to perfection with a touch of honey. Truly I have never tasted such a delicious green tea. I will definitely be returning to Momo's Kebab. I really want to try one of their specials on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here with 2 friends. We came on a Thursday night and there were a few other people there. The server was very attentive and helpful, explaining all the options we asked about patiently. We also practiced our French chatting with the owner! Great food at a fantastic price."}
{"text":"MoMo's is an absolute gem of a restaurant!  The food is incredibly tasty--perfectly spiced and cooked.  All ingredients are fresh and high-quality.  If you are looking for truly outstanding, authentic, healthy food--this is your place.  Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming.  Price cannot be beat--we fed our family of 4 here including fresh salads, delicious moroccan tea for all, generous meals, fresh-baked bread, and the amazing French cookie sampler, all for under $45.  We truly enjoyed this place and recommend highly to others!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic (lamb medallions) and the service was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh. The owner is very personable, friendly, and attentive. Make sure you tell them if you want the tea or not because it will be added to your bill. We never asked for it but it was presented so we thought it was included. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Amazing Kefta Kabab sandwich and chicken Kabab sandwich and salad. Very reasonable. I extremely recommending this place."}
{"text":"I love a personal touch, and on top of great food and service, this place has just become a favorite of mine. 

The menu is small, but amazingly well done. The cuisine is Moroccan, and for us, was served by the chef himself in a friendly, welcoming way. 

The kebab is amazing; flavorful, simple and tasty, with wonderful rice and grilled vegetables that will make mouths WATER. (I especially loved the eggplant, and my wife, who is not always a veggie fan, loved every bit.) All of the platter meals are served with hot half-loaves of a tasty grain bread, and side salads festooned with olives and a wonderful lemon vinaigrette. 

The drink menu is mostly only water, but if you get a chance, here's a tip; order the green mint tea. Served in a long-pour Moroccan style,(by the owner himself.) It's tasty, soothing, sweet and minty. My wife and I agreed next time, we get TWO pots! 

To top it off, we got some of the house cookies, which are classic stuff; nutty, tasty and really a great way to finish off the meal. 

Parking here is a bit sparse, but there's a great parking garage behind the building (city run) that's very safe and not too expensive at all. 

So, if you're looking for a treat and want something authentic and well done, try this little place on Lee Road. To sum up, I can only say this; when it comes to Kebab, MAKE MINE MOMO'S !!"}
{"text":"Tried first time today, certainly a joke not a restaurant, ordered tagine which was not fresh at least 2 days old starting to go sour with a single piece of meat and lamb which was over cooked:

I didn't like the place at all, poor food quality , small portions and high price. Unhappy and will not come back"}
{"text":"Discovered this place while searching for Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food during a business trip in the Cleveland area. The owner welcomed us and explained the menu. I was initially disappointed since I came here for the Tagine and couscous but I found out that Tagine is only served on the weekends. We started with Harira soup and it was good although lacking in salt (which is good I guess for your health). The bread that was served with Harira was amazing and I could tell it was freshly baked. Then we got the Mediterranean salad (included with the platter) which was fresh and had good flavor. Since they had no Tagine, I picked their beef Kefta kebab and my wife picked the Chicken kebab which were served with buttery fluffy rice, spicy Harissa sauce, and grilled vegetables (bell pepper, Eggplant, and tomato). Kebabs were delicious and the sauce went perfectly with them. We ended the dinner with Moroccan mint tea. The owner was very hospitable and we had good conversation with him. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Loved their couscous and kebab platters. Starting with a Moroccan tea was an excellent idea. If you are so hungry and not willing to wait for some time for food,  you may want to try this place sometime when you feel less hungry or willing to wait some time. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last Friday at 7pm after having it bookmarked for the past few months. Decor is cute and space is clean and well-lit. There appeared to be just two employees there- a cook in the kitchen and a waiter. We were seated when the restaurant was about half full, and people just kept coming in after us. Thus, service was a tad slow as the one waiter raced around to all the tables. I didn't mind, but if you're in a rush, beware! 

All that aside I enjoyed the food. I ordered the Kefta plate and split chickpea soup and my boyfriend got the chicken. The chicken was ok, a little bland. The Kefta was wonderfully seasoned and cooked though! The food is very wholesome and \"clean\" tasting. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I'm between a 3.5-4. Momo's is a wonderful addition to Lee Road. The owner is from Morocco and wanted to start his business about 7 years ago, which is when he first moved here to Cleveland. However, the economic downturn made things difficult. He was able to open up in 2015!

About the food - the menu is fairly simple. Lunch and dinner options are the same (as well as the price! Very affordable!) we've tried the chicken and beef kabob, and the lamb special. The beef kabob is our favorite and is a go-to. My husband ordered the lamb when we went out to eat with a group and we discovered that it came out with varying levels of rare to done. It might be good to specify.

The Kabobs come with salad and rice. The salad has a little mint in it! So refreshing. 

I can't wait to come and try the tagine and stew. That looks great!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eat here after hearing multiple raving reviews. All employees were super nice and helpful. Unfortunately, the food was not good at all. We were there with a large group so there was a variety of different foods ordered. Nobody in our group was happy as the meat (beef and lamb) was tough and not tasty. Tabouleh salad was too sour and grilled veggies were soaking in oil."}
{"text":"Delicious salad and vegan plate of rice and veggies with a slightly spicy sauce. Quiet. Homemade cookies and pot of slightly sweet tea. 

Relaxing after a busy day. But there was only this one vegetarian choice."}
{"text":"I had a great time at MoMo's but it wasn't solely because of the food but because of the service and atmosphere.  I was given a gift card for Christmas from my dad because I organize I dinner club that dines all over the Cleveland area. MoMo's is a place that fits our criteria of small/independent/unique dining.  
The owner was so accommodating to our 8 person table. He was friendly and funny, taking a moment to go over the dishes on the menu, all of which were amazing.  I appreciated the time he took in helping us decide on some entrees and appetizers to try.  We also ordered Mint tea for the table which was continuously refilled as soon as it was empty. I can't think of a single criticism of this wonderful establishment.. I can't wait to return and am planning to bring everyone I know to this cool local eatery."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now! I live the mixed grill chicken dish, very earthy in flavor, no salt, pair this with the hot morrocan tea and it's a pretty healthy meal in my book! You receive service from Mohammed himself in which he displays his passion for delivering great service and a quality product!"}
{"text":"Was surprising the food is so delicious and salad is very fresh in this small restaurant. I had lamb and it was tender. I AM GOING T TRY COUSCOUS NEXT TIME,  OH,  AND FALAFLE."}
{"text":"Being the sole Moroccan restuarant in the Cleveland area, Momo's doesn't dissappoint! While the menu is small, the selections are excellent and freshly preapred. The bread is baked in a clay oven, much like a tandori, but different. Now, if there is one thing that you absolutely must try, it is the mint tea (gunpowder green tea leaves steeped with mint and sugar), which is a customary hot drink in Morocco that is simply amazing! The owner (Mo) is also a delightful person to talk with and is very welcoming. Lastly, the portions are ample, and while I might be biased, I usually order the lentil soup with a chicken dish (forgot the name). Overall, excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a date to Momo's. Stepping through the door, I felt like I'd left Cleveland's snow behind and entered the warmth of Morocco. The decor was warm and inviting. I had the beef and veggie couscous special and my husband had the beef kebabs. Both were excellent. The service was fast and very friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Don't forget to try their delicious mint tea!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today for the first time at Momo's and it was delicious! I got the lamb while the husband got the chicken kabob. Came with rice, roasted eggplants, tomatoes and peppers, homemade wheat bread and a side salad. The salad was fresh and seasoned with just the right amount of oil and vinegar (best salad I've had). The lamb was tender and flavorful but not overwhelming. Chicken was perfectly cooked! We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place multiple times.
Great food.
I am in love with their lamb and salad, meat is worth the drive.
Ambiance is also great and the Muhammad who owns the place is great guy."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant. Good fresh Moroccan food. Chef MoMo is a knowledgeable and gracious host. And the price is reasonable. I have one minor quibble-no ice for drinks. Overall, do yourself a favor and go and support this local gem."}
{"text":"About as good as it gets! Fabulously fresh salad, moist chicken and roast lamb ( Thursday special) was flavorful and perfect. Great bread as well. 

This place is small and almost a one-man-band. Relax! The food will be worth it!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and were the first customer of the day. The gentleman working there was very friendly but the food was really oily and bland. I had the lamb and my wife had the grilled vegetable platter. Both were under seasoned and too greasy. The tabouli was really good tho and the fresh bread was good, although very crunchy. We'll prob try it again but were a bit disappointed with our visit."}
{"text":"We have been to Momo's several times and love it. A friend called it a \"real find\": intimate, atmospheric, unique, and serves delicious food. All of the food is extremely tasty and of the highest quality. The mood is casual but festive and colorful. We were in Morocco three years ago and just melt with bliss when Momo raises the silver teapot up high to pour the mint tea in the traditional way. A perfect restaurant for something different, reasonable, and delicious."}
{"text":"A huge fan of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern (MME) cuisine, I was glad to see another one pop up in The Heights as another option to Anatolia. Such a peculiar name, just had to try it. Brought the family. Cute and colorful little place designed and laid-out with Moroccan-themed decor. Our server, who was awesome, started us off with some bread. Not sure what kind it was - never had it before - but it was semi-flat, grainy/wheaty with a denser consistency. I didn't care for it much and it didn't help that they didn't serve it with any butter or olive oil. We also got their Mediterranean salad. It came with a good mix of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta. It was good, but the dressing was a little on the sour side for my taste. Onto the entree. As a first-timer here, I ordered the kefta platter, which is my favorite item to order in MME restaurants. Got 4 medallions of kefta with rice, roasted eggplants, green peppers and tomatoes. The veggies were good, but the kefta was a bit underwhelming. They were dry and though spicy, they lacked more seasoning. It was the first time I've had kefta that was spicy - perhaps the Moroccan version? Another downfall for me was they had no offerings for kids. Ended up getting the kefta sandwiches for the kids as I thought it would be the closest thing to a hamburger... not knowing they were spicy, the kids didn't care for them. Plus their sandwich is \"deconstructed\" and served with the same bread when we first sat down. As it was a flatter bread (not pita that you can use as a wrap) we were having trouble figuring out how to fit the meat into the bread, so I just cut a pocket into it with a knife and tried our best to make it a sandwich.

We came in around 5:30PM and there were only two couples dining in at the time, but it quickly filled up to capacity by the time we got our meal. Our server was by herself and she did the best she could to accommodate everyone while still having a smile on her face and a great attitude.

Though the menu is pretty modest (which I prefer most times), they have some other offerings that I'd like to come back and try. Aside from the kefta that I had on this visit, they also offer beef and chicken kabobs, tagine and other daily specials.

This visit didn't blow me out of the water, but am curious enough to try other dishes on the menu to come back."}
{"text":"Exceptional. Well priced, phenomenal service, fresh and high quality ingredients, and delicious food. I had beef kabob, rice, and vegetables, accompanied with the fresh, made daily in house bread. The meal was served with a great salad, which may be the nicest house salad I've ever seen. I found myself returning the next day and tried the chicken kabob, which was again perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the price you get a very good amount of food. They don't over do it at all, you will feel satisfied after your mean but not overly stuffed. I have no hesitation returning to this restaurant and recommending it to others."}
{"text":"A nice intimate space with authentic food. The food is prepared fresh, the flavors are simple yet delicious, and the prices are reasonable. I had the harisa soup, the Kefta sandwich, and the Moroccan mint tea. The kefta was tender and savory. The side salad that comes with the sandwich is simply dressed with olive oil, herbs, and lemon - very good. Momo makes his own whole wheat bread - delicious. Oh, and the mint tea has a terrific aftertaste. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Moroccan food and the owner was so attentive. Chicken kabob was great and the home made sauces were fantastic."}
{"text":"The colors inside and decorations are awesome. The owner is really nice and cool to talk to. The food was good - salad was fresh and I got the beef Kebob with rice. Seasoning was great and the rice was fresh. The only criticism I have is that the kebob was really tough, probably has to do with the cut of meat since it's reasonably priced! The bread that came with it made the meal for sure. I will be returning to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Nice owner from Morocco. simple menu so easy for picking. have all meats covered. Favor is more toward the herby side. very traditional feeling place. tasty meat."}
{"text":"First time at MoMo's, and it was delicious! I've only had Moroccan food a few times, so I can't quite compare it to anything. HOWEVER, it was super yummy! Great price for a lot of fresh, quality food. Service was wonderful. The owner talked to us all night. He was very friendly and personal. It made the experience all that much better. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"First of all, amazing food. We had the beef and chicken kebabs. Absolutely recommend. 
Exceptional service. The chef/owner  loves to interact with the customers. He told us that he goes to the market every day to deliver fresh ingredients. His dedication to his restaurant is very apparent. Our waitress was very sweet as well. Overall amazing experience."}
{"text":"A restaurant that you leave feeling that right amount of fullness, not feeling polluted or still hungry! The chef individually serves each table and prepares everything on the spot! We ordered the tabouleh salad and chicken and beef kabobs. The perfect spice level that was quenched with a definite must, the warm green tea with fresh mint! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious and the owner is very friendly. Definitely try Harira, tagine and cuscous."}
{"text":"I was stopping at Cleveland just for a night and found this place. I like the decorations - looks genuine. I ordered the chicken plate to go, it came with 4 pieces of grilled chicken, vegetables(eggplants soooo good), rice, Moroccan bread and salad!! And spicy sauce was good too! I saw others ordered tangin - looked so good. I wish I could have that too."}
{"text":"First time here and I would say it was a great experience. It was shared that the meat is Halal which was nice. Mohammed, Mo, is a fantastic chef and conversationalist. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had Mediterranean style food this fresh and tasty. I don't even eat bread but how can you not resist the hot oven fresh bread right in front of you. The rice was done perfectly it was a great complement to the dish. The vegetables that complement the dish were also well done.   The finishing touch of the Moroccan tea slightly sweetened poured at the end of the meal was a perfect finish to a great lunch. I am very excited to go back very soon."}
{"text":"YES, YES, YES, and YES! The genius of Einstein combined with the culinary acumen of Gordon Ramsay. Momo's is making a statement and it's a delicious one. The tagine is to die for and by far the best dish on the menu (but only available on Saturdays). Easily one of the best (and most unrecognized) restaurants in Cleveland. This place is a true gem, I can only hope it stays hidden."}
{"text":"I've been on a reviewing spree for this place.

Had beef, rice and vegetables. Served with a salad and khobz (Moroccan bread, flat and dense). Followed by traditional green tea with mint--slightly sweetened. The owner, Mohamed, emphasizes on his website and social media presence that the food is fresh--which is very apparent when eating.

This is not a knock on MoMo's but more of a warning for parties that have unrealistic expectations of the service when they have a party of six or more: you cannot expect a small establishment to accommodate you--be flexible and not entitled. One can quite literally peer into the kitchen and see the capacity of the grill and preparation area. The food is made to order. Do not have unrealistic expectations of a small business that does a exceedingly good job.

In summation: best for smaller parties, wonderful for a date, and intimate conversation."}
{"text":"Nice little place, with a very pleasant chef/owner. The food was freshly prepared to order. The portions were fairly small, but adequate, and proportionate to the cost. Two of us ordered sandwiches, which included a small salad which was served first, and was very tasty. The sandwich was served with homemade flat wheat bread, and roasted veggies. The beef was a little tough but very flavorful. I think the kefta looked like the best bet. Worth a trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The \"Thursday Special\" of lamb has phenomenal spice! Delicious! Salad was extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Owner was very nice but we've had much better. Salad had a dressing that tasted like pure lemon juice, bread was dry and tasteless. My chicken kabob was ok, but my husbands beef kabob was dry and tasteless like the bread. Very few choices on the menu. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and have ordered multiple things on the menu- all delicious with equally great service to match. This evening, I came in for my usual Tagine( a Saturday special) and there was already a big party there in addition to several other patrons. As a regular customer, I know the chef runs a small operation and was (understandably) busy.  

One loud woman at the table was behaving egregiously, loudly complaining about her \"disappointment with the serve,\" her meal being \"inedible,\" and making continuous unreasonable demands at the already short staff( by the way, a couple who are the nicest to the bone people I've ever met). This terrible customer continued her complaints loudly, nearly ruining my meal.  She came in there with a chip on her shoulder, ready to take it out on anyone no matter what.

The only reason why I am rating four stars is because I wonder at what point do you have to cut a customer off in order to prevent her/him from ruining it for other patrons?  It's too bad that the staff couldn't focus their energies towards more positive, grateful ( not to mention regular) customers.  

I'll continue to go to Momo's because his food is delicious and the service is great. But in the future I hope they stand their ground more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Cedar-Lee area. 

The food is superior in quality to anything else in the area, and you don't leave feeling like you've committed a mortal sin against your digestive tract and coronary arteries. 

We go here when we don't want to cook but want food that tastes homemade.

Definitely go to MoMo's. And then do it again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Mo is a congenial, wonderful owner/chef. The beef tagine was delectable and the mint tea is perfect. I will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"What a delightful authentic Moroccan treasure here in Cleveland! The chef owner is friendly, and prepares delicious, fresh food that delights your palate with every bite! Definitely highly recommended. We had lamb chops, chicken kabob platter, Moroccan bread,mint tea and cookies, all were simply perfect"}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Moroccan restaurants in Cleveland.  Everything was well portioned and very healthy. Mint tea was delightful poured. Would def visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Delicious chicken kebabs, warm, bright atmosphere and a fantastic host, who is an intelligent, well-travelled man.  The wheat bread is made in-house and is served warm.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  I'll be back next time I'm in Cleveland to try the couscous."}
{"text":"After a half dozen visits, I can say that this is one of my favorite restaurants.  I rarely deviate from Korean restaurants and I hate having to go all the way into Cleveland Hts. for anything, but this place is worth the trip.  Why?:
1) Freshness - the salad served is the freshest, most vibrant, and interesting I have ever had despite its simplicity.  Freshly-squeezed lemon juice is a key here, as well as a spice mix I have not been able to re-create at home.  The bread is freshly-made in house and very whole-grain so I don't feel as guilty eating it all : ).  A lot of places brag about making their tabouleh fresh daily.  Mo makes it all to order, cutting the parsley and other ingredients fresh.  It will be the best you have ever had.
2) Taste - I have had various Middle Eastern cuisines (I guess Moroccan can be grouped there), but they never blew me away.  I don't know for sure if I have an affinity for this cuisine or if it is just Mo's excellent execution that keeps drawing me in.  Also, always get the lamb option if available and you like lamb.  A few dollars more, but it is so worth it.  I overheard Mo talking to another customer about how he gets his meat and he has very high standards.  Other reviews have mentioned the tea and cookies - worthy of the hype and I get them every time.
3) Service - I am always warmly greeted and remembered.  Mo remembers what I like and lets me know if he still has some lamb available.  Given how labor-intensive this kind of fresh food preparation is, I'm impressed with how well they run the front-of-the-house as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to try some different regional cuisines, and while looking up restaurants in Cleveland Heights I happened upon a restaurant that was advertised as Moroccan cuisine. 

This was my first time having Moroccan cuisine, and I was thoroughly impressed. I got the beef tagine, and there isn't anything quite like beef and vegetables that have been stewed for a very long period of time. The beef was juicy and tender, and because it was stewed, the meat was very easy to cut and quite tasty. The carrots and potatoes were also super soft.

I also got the lamb platter, which likewise came with an assortment of vegetables as well as some rice. The lamb was pretty good too, though not as amazing as the tagine.

Both entrees came with salad and bread. The salad was fairly standard, but the bread was incredibly tasty and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Went here the other evening for dinner - I really cannot say anything bad about it.  It's not the most amazing or fancy place but the food is wonderful and the people are great.  I Highly recommend.

Don't be afraid to try something knew or to ask for recommendations if you have not tried something - they are very helpful with explaining things."}
{"text":"First Rate! 
The chef greets us at the door with his tall white hat and brings cold water and lovely mint tea, slightly sweet and refreshing. Soon, the special of the evening arrives, cous cous with lamb for her and beef for me. Hot, a little spicy, full of flavor, chunky vegetables stewed the traditional way, this restaurant captures the authentic Moroccan flavors, without fanfare, but with pride and delicacy. 
There is a soul satisfying, home-cooking quality to good Moroccan stews, and Momo's has it!"}
{"text":"I had their beef kebab and it was excellent!! Very reasonable price ...will be back to try some of their other entrees.

Dropped in again, after three months, for take out kafteh kebab... Very good again ... cooked to perfection with a delicious side house salad that was savored!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great place! We were just searching online and found this highly rated restaurant, and we decided to check it out. The decoration of the restaurant is very unique and comfortable. The owner was very welcoming! We ordered the chickpea soup, roasted lamb for entree and tea. Everything was Excellent! Lamb was so soft, and it comes with probably The best rice I've ever had. Tea was outstanding, it was sweet green tea with fresh mint. Soup was awesome too. Everything is on the greasy side of the food spectrum, which I don't mind at all (portion is fairly small and the spices in the food were refreshing). Great place, go check it out!"}
{"text":"(4.5) Dope place with awesome tea and delicious cookies. The menu may be simple but the food is all great. Even the bread is delicious! Everything tastes extremely fresh. It's like the chef just bought everything the same day. 

The service is great and courteous. If you get the mint tea the server will give it to you the Moroccan way!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try on a whim (if it weren't for the Yelp app, we wouldn't have known it existed in our own city).  
We were greeted by our waitress, who was extremely welcoming and nice.  We were surprised that there was no alcohol, so we ordered the hot fresh mint tea, which is sweetened with organic sugar.  It arrived in a pretty silver pot, accompanied by two small silver and glass cups.  This is very good and is worth the $5.00 price.
We both ordered the Thursday special, roast lamb, which is served with a substantial side salad, baked-in-house whole grain bread, fragrant basmati rice, and grilled vegetables.  There was also a spicy sauce on the plate, so be aware of you don't like spicy sauces, ask them to leave it off.  My husband loved it and took mine.
The lamb was delicious, but it was not very tender and we had difficulties cutting it, but I think it was just luck and not the chef.  It was so good tasting, but there was a lot of gristle.
The rice was amazing; I could eat it every day.  If you're vegetarian, you will love the rice, grilled vegetables and warm bread by itself.  
The restaurant has plenty of seating, and it is decorated by the owner/chef Mo and his wife (who handmade cushions and seats that are for use in the place, and they are very pretty).  
The chef himself came out to the dining room to personally see if we liked the food.  
This place has a small menu, but it's fresh and the staff is wonderful and put you at ease.  We will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was amazingly complex. Atmosphere was relaxing. The place was packed on the Saturday we visited - and for good reason.  An experience like no other in the Cleveland area. Staff was fantastic. Mint tea was perfect.  Main course was delicious.   I highly recommend Momo's - try it and you too will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Lovely family run spot - excellent food though a limited menu. Had the beef refine and lefts kabob with salads and fantastic tea."}
{"text":"The food is simple and good. We had the Friday special, a couscous with beef -- hearty portion with plenty of carrots, potatoes and squash. We also enjoyed the kafta kabob--a little spicy, but not dry like some kabobs.

Very small establishment, where you might be served by the chef. Very well priced. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice, authentic middle eastern (I want to say Moroccan) feel. My husband loved his lamb and rice dish, and I ordered the tea and freshly made French cookies, both of which were delicious. We were also served freshly made bread as an appetiser."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem for Cleveland. I had a lamb and couscous, and when it was brought to the table I distinctly noticed how good it smelled. Amazing food."}
{"text":"We haven't had good moroccan food in cleveland in quite some time. Place is a small sit down spot right down the block from cedar lee cinema. My wife and sis each had a kabob, one chicken and one beef they were both season well and pretty good, but not the best I ever had. But what I really enjoyed was the couscous which is a north african staple. The restaurant has couscous on fridays and tajines on saturday as specials. I got the lamb couscous (pictured) but beef and vegan couscous were also offered as options. Plus a pot of moroccan mint tea for $5, I will def be coming back to explore more menu options"}
{"text":"Good food, serving sizes medium, prices are good. I especially enjoyed the tea, which is by the pot and the server puts on a kind of show of serving the tea."}
{"text":"Fresh food with mild flavors.  I could drink the mint tea everyday.  The owner is a true professional.  Very glad to have met him."}
{"text":"Awesome gem in Cleveland Heights! I ordered the beef kebab \"sandwich\" to-go. It is served with the meat/veggies separate from the bread so you can decide how you want to enjoy it, which I love. Everything was cooked really well and the portion size was great for the affordable price ($7). You even get a hearty side salad in addition.

The staff was so incredibly friendly and ensured you had a great experience. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious Beef Kebob. Very fresh and well seasoned. Ultra adorable decor too!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Really enjoyed my platter with a little of everything on it. Chef MoMo is quite the host! Came out, explained everything on the menu, was amazingly personable and make the experience really fun. Not to mention, the food was amazing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Tabouli and bread was a great starter. Go straight for the platter options. We tried the Lamb platter and Chicken Kebab platter. Both were excellently seasoned and cooked.  The spicy sauce is awesome and made fresh daily. If you like moderately spicy food you don't need to have it on the side. Don't miss out on the tea service and cookies. It was so nice to meet the owner and hear that they buy their ingredients fresh daily."}
{"text":"As a neighborhood local, I've eaten at Momo's with my family probably dozens of times and can tell you that it's seriously legit. It's run by Mo and his wife and believe me, they serve up delicious home-style Moroccan food with personalized service that'll have you feeling like a guest in their home! 

The meats are tender and flavorful, vegetables cooked perfectly crisp-tender (that eggplant is to die for!) and each dish comes with the best rice you've ever tasted. My family tends to favor the lamb loin platter and tagine. Both soups offered are hearty and come in a generously-sized bowl. Though it's not on the menu, vegetarians can have Mo make a vegetable/rice platter or sandwich, as well a small plate of olives and feta cheese to accompany their meal. Platters and salads are easily made gluten free by omitting the side order of bread, though it is delicious and baked daily. Do NOT skip on the freshly made Moroccan mint tea, either! Mo's wife also bakes French-style cookies, which are lightly sweetened and make a delicious final dish or midnight snack after you get home and have digested a little. 

Pro tip: If you're in a rush, try to avoid dining in during weekend dinner hours, as this small space can easily become full to capacity."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night and waited a little bit before seated. We ordered the harira, tabouleh, lamb platter, and lamb tagging special. Everything was delicious, tasted homemade, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. We were started on a complementary salad - what a pleasant surprise! Perfectly seasoned with good quality olive oil and lemon juice, I love the peppery bite of the radish and tanginess of feta cheese. The tabouleh tasted super fresh and really opened up our appetite. The harira, though also delicious, was probably the least outstanding dish of the night. 

Now onto the main courses - the lamb platter came with 2 lamb loin chops, grilled veggies, and saffron rice. The lamb was grilled to a perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful with fresh herbs. The saffron rice was fluffy and cooked perfected. The grilled veggies was great - I especially love the undertone of good olive oil in them. It came with a dollop of harissa - it had a nice kick and complemented the lamb perfectly. 

The lamb tagine was also outstanding. The meat was tender and the potatoes and carrots soaked up all the delicious meat flavor. I used the bread to dip into and mop up the sauce. The only critique I have was the portion of the tagine dish was quite small. 

I would definitely come back and can't wait to try all their dishes!"}
{"text":"Well, it just doesn't get much better than this. Our first (and certainly not last) Momo's experience hit all of our most prized dining-out criteria:

- Simple, fresh, and healthfully prepared foods
- An authentic ethnic food experience
- Extraordinary value for the price point
- Warm, welcoming service

This place does just a few things and does them WELL. Homemade flatbreads with simple ingredients, fresh, lean marinated meats. Simple grilled veggies. Hot, strong, sweet mint tea. Homemade cookies. That's the bulk of the menu and it's all delightful. Bonus: you could easily get out of Momo's, satisfied, for about $10.00 per person. Perfect!"}
{"text":"This place apparently just opened 5 months or so ago, so glad we discovered it! It's a small restaurant but the atmosphere is great, it's nice and clean, and the servers & chef are extremely nice and friendly. The food is halal! I LOVE their lamb kebab and the Moroccan tea, it's green tea with a nice sweet minty flavor. Their cookies are also amazing. They serve a nice full plate of salad to each person before each meal, it's like a nice large side Mediterranean salad, and is absolutely delicious, with feta cheese and everything. The entree serving sizes are smaller than what we are accustomed to here in the US, but are definitely filling. Oh and I love that they're open late, perfect for the busy student/professional looking for a nice cheap healthy meal. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A new gem on cedar lee restaurant row. Looks a little mom and poppy, authentic looking Moroccan plush seats right up front. Got chicken kebab salad, beef kebab platter and green bean and carrot side dish. Didn't care that much for the green bean and carrot salad, small plate Twas just ok. Lightly seasoned with some herbs. Meals also came with fresh baked whole wheat herb bread. I try not to indulge in too much bread at meals but it was warm and fresh and unlike any typical roll (no butter available but it paired nice when dipping it in olive oil). For the chicken kebab salad I only got like 4 chicken medallion but the meat was tender and flavor town! The salad dressing was a  nice lemon flavor but could have used more. The beef kebab platter came with roasted veggies (eggplant tomato) and revved up rice. Meat itself was a little dry but again if the flavor could tweet it would say #boom. 

Great place will defintely come again. Prices were reasonable. I didn't feel stuffed at the end though. Unfortunately their acclaimed tangine dish is only available on Saturdays and per the owner runs out fast, however if you call ahead he will set one aside for you."}
