{"text":"The Midway is closed.  I had never been here but I do drive by this location often and noticed the other day that the space is empty and for lease."}
{"text":"I love the nostalgia that carnival food brings back. I don't get to fairs much since my kids are grown so it's nice to get some of the food I enjoyed oh so many years ago!  Eating at Midway is BETTER than at a carnival because you can sit down at a booth and enjoy your grub without people bumping into you and flies sharing your food.  I've eaten their twice and enjoyed a juicy burger, tasty chicken gyro, fresh cut fires, thick and creamy chocolate shake, deep fried Reese Cup and powdered sugar covered funnel cake.  I just wish they had a store in North Ridgeville where I live - however, it is worth a trip to Berea for their gastronomical delights!"}
{"text":"If you're a fine dining gourmand, stay far, far away.  But if you like your food so greasy and fattening you can almost hear the kids screaming on the Ferris Wheel, this place is for you.     Located in a sad looking retail strip, The Midway is a compact neon hole in the wall with fair and carnival posters plastered everywhere.  It's an experiment in food at McD's prices but offering treats that you used to only get during the summer at your local county fair.  With a large variety of sandwiches from cheese steaks to Italian sausage, gyros to fried bologna, you can order your favorite with a side of fresh chips or fair fries with vinegar.  They even offer fried dill pickles and cheese on a stick.  And they not only offer elephant ears and cotton candy for dessert, but you can try a deep fried Twinkie or Euclid Beach's Humphrey Popcorn Balls.    Kids' meals are under $4 and include a \"mini\" elephant ear or funnel cake although it took three people to finish off my daughter's plate size version.  The owners are eager to please and very friendly.  I'd love to see this place succeed just for the novelty of it."}
{"text":"Green grass, ketchup and mustard colored tables...are you sure this isn't the carnival?   I had just spent a week in Honduras and thought I needed to reintroduce myself to Americana food and choose the Midway - home of American food.   My friend and I ordered the Midway Burger ($5.49), Philly Cheese-steak ($5.49), Fresh Cut Fries ($2.49), Fried Mushrooms ($3.79), Fried Dill Pickles ($4.29), Freshly Squeezed Lemonade ($2.49), and a Sioux City Soda ($1.95). Yes there were only 2 people eating. The fryer was roaring 5 minutes after we placed our order haha.   They have table service and the food was greasy and delicious. I would defiantly go back for the fried pickles and I hope next time I go I have room for a fried Twinkies or a fried peanut butter Oreo. I may walk there next time."}
{"text":"The midway is a great idea, not well executed.  I was super excited to come here, and I took my 2 year old niece to join the fun.  It's very sad looking inside, in an abandoned carnival sort of way.  There was a claw machine that kept us busy for a couple minutes, and then a weird clown man that randomly started talking and kicking the glass box it was in.  I tried to pretend like I wasn't scared, but I was.    I ordered her the kids meal which included a corn dog w/fries, mini funnel cake and a capri sun.  The corn dog was VERY good, and lucky for me, way too big for my niece.  I ordered the breaded mushrooms and a reuben (about $17) which was way too much food.  Mushrooms were nothing I haven't had a million times before and the reuben was just okay.  It's probably my favorite sandwich, so I've had a lot of good ones.  I was on the spot and didn't know what to order so I got that by default.   We waited for about 8 minutes (8 long minutes trying to occupy a 2 year old) and then the food came out.  Since there were no other customers there, the two women working went back to sitting at the table out front to chain smoke.  It was kinda unappetizing.    I think this idea is great.  The location sucks and the (lack of) advertising sucks.  I only knew about it because there's a coupon in the entertainment book.  They need to really explore it and advertise kids parties and such.  I think it's a great idea for our fatasses here in the midwest."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about the Midway.  On the one hand, the idea of a place serving all of the terribly unhealthy delights you can only usually find at a carnival or fair is a great idea.  On the other hand, it could very well be frightening in it's execution.    The reality is, the Midway is neither of those extremes.  The menu is pretty varied, but generally the sorts of things you would expect.  Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Fries, funnel cakes, fried cheese, etc.  There are also gyros, cheesesteaks, gyros, ruebens (also available in potato pancakes instead of bread), and on Fridays, fried fish.    I ordered a Midway burger, which was delicious.  It looks like every picture you've ever seen of a Big Mac (which is good), as opposed to looking like any Big Mac you've ever actually eaten (which is bad).   The fresh cut fries were good and plentiful, but nothing set them apart from those I've had elsewhere.  Fried Cheese on a stick was just like you'd get at the fair, which is to say delicious and very bad for you at the same time.  The real show stopper was the Haley O's, which are deep fried oreos with peanut butter on them.  These were simply amazing.   On this particular visit, the staff seemed completely overwhelmed by the lunch rush, and a lot of the customers were pretty unhappy.  This was my first visit so I can't say if this is the norm, and because of that I am not weighing that too heavily for this review.    If you are wanting to abuse yourself in one of the most delicious ways possible, I think you may want to pay the Midway a visit."}
{"text":"The gyros were great and inexpensive also. My husband ordered the fried Oreos and they were pretty good. I ordeder the fried pickeles and didn't care for them too much, but they did exchange it for something else. I think this is definitely somewhere we will visit again before we leave the Cleveland area!!! It is not fine dining, but it does deliver exactly what it says it does!"}
