{"text":"My wife and I found this place convenient to the Hyatt while on a quick holiday to Montreal. The owner greeted us as we walked in and offered a sample of a delicious hot, cheese filled bread. That set the hook. We ordered a hot ham and cheese bread and a couple BonBon cafés. The food and drinks were great and we will be back without a doubt... very tasty food and coffees."}
{"text":"Great place for am awesome quick breakfast.    The cachitos were great and include an amazing dip that you will learn to love.    Everything is warm and the workers are super friendly.    You really should try this place out."}
{"text":"I did not expect the pastries to be from Venezuela as I walked in, but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Rather than the traditional French pastries, what I expected, I was greeted with fresh bread filled with cheese, ham, and other delicacies.   Not being a native, the woman behind the counter (waitress?) was extremely friendly and explained each cachito, starting from the original to the best-sellers, even cutting one open and giving a taste-test to my whole family. At the end, I ordered \"fromage et jambon\", \"épinard\", \"chocolat\", and \"goyave et fromage\".   Coming from right out of the oven, the bread had a perfect balance of crispy and buttery, the inside melted and warm. Even the coffee we ordered (latte and ferrer-o-frappe) had a perfect balance of sweet and bitter.   All in all, from decorations to the environment, from customer service to the variety of pastries, I am just glad I didn't go to a traditional French pastry shop."}
{"text":"First time reviewer here! In Montreal visiting friends and they took us here for lunch. I had the ham and cheese cachito fresh from the oven, and it was everything I wanted it to be. The service was top-notch too, super friendly staff! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So good. We stopped here for a quick breakfast while exploring downtown and were blown away by how good these cachitos are. We tried the cheese, ham and cheese, as well as the cheese and guava. Such a great savoury/slightly sweet flavour -- try them! The service was friendly, the food very reasonably priced, and everything was ready fast. We also had two of their signature coffees, with sweetened condensed milk at the bottom. Go try cachitos!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect but went there anyway since it had such good reviews. It's a small family business and the cachitos are all freshly baked. The food was delicious and well worth the price. Very friendly staff (we got free drinks!)."}
{"text":"The cachitos are great, the service is friendly and the coffee is good. Check it out."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service . Fresh stuffed bread. Lovely alfajores. Good coffee place. Very small terrasse. Maybe 8 seats."}
{"text":"Amazing new place specialized on \"cachitos\", a small horn shaped bread, native to Venezuela, that is traditionally filled with ham or cheese.  They have delicious variations such as turkey and cream cheese, beef, chicken, ricotta and parmesan, and guava and cheese (my favorite). Me and my wife tried almost all of them and the taste was incredible.  They also serve coffees and desserts. The place is nicely decorated and the staff couldn't be more kind.   Highly recommended to anyone willing to try a delicious, different kind of food."}
{"text":"Cachitos are delicious, and the owners have created a beautifully designed and immaculate space. I had the guava and cheese cachito, and it was a fantastic combination. If you're looking for something new and different for a light breakfast or lunch, this is a must-visit."}
{"text":"My sister was in town and we were on our way to Old Port to walk around and were starving. We found Cachitos through Yelp and decided to try it.  We walk in not entirely knowing what to expect. We are immediately welcomed and offered a sample because she could tell we didn't really know what we were ordering. We got a ham and cheese, guava and cheese, and spinach and ricotta. All of them were incredible! The sweet and savory mix of the guava and cheese was especially delicious, all should try that one.  On top of the Cachitos, we got a Bonbon espresso with condensed milk and a macchiato. The espresso was definitely the favorite, as it was so sweet with the condensed milk but still packed the good espresso punch. The macchiato was also very good, but very strong, so beware if you're looking for something sweeter or more dessert-like.  The service was absolutely the best part of Cachitos though. They helped us choose what to get and how much, were very speedy, and obviously loved seeing us try their homemade authentically Venezuelan food. An experience in itself and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This Cafe/Restaurant should make any Venezuelan proud of their food.   The Cachitos are not only extremely good, but a true representation of the Venezuelan ones. I would actually say that they are even better than some cachitos you would find in Venezuela itself.  I would recommend this to anyone for any occasion at any time. Please try the Jugo de Papelon con Limon.  Thanks to the staff and Liliana for the service they gave us, and also for making us Venezuelans in Canada proud of our origins and food."}
{"text":"Endroit super sympathique pour découvrir des pâtisserie du Venezuela ! Le café y est excellent aussi et le personnel très accueillant! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best customer service I had ever experience!!!! The good taste amazing however, I must disagree with the frappchino. Overall, I would give 4.5/5 but 5/5 for customer service. Extremely nice people. Perfect for tourists that don't know any French."}
{"text":"Every time I make it to Montreal, I stop in and grab some tasty baked goods. I'm yet to have one I didn't enjoy.   I've been going here for a while now and the folks are always really nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I ordered 30 Cheese, Spinach, Ovava+Cheese and Chocolate Cachitos for breakfast at work and everyone liked it. I am impressed with quality ingredients. These are like filled Croissants but less buttery.  Will be ordering more in future."}
{"text":"Was walking around the area and found this...well worth it! Reasonable prices, and extremely filling! The cachitos are absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"Unique and authentic stuffed \"pies\" from Venezuela. Delicious.  I recommend the ham and cheese filled cachitos. So yummy.   You think you've tried foods of the world? You must try these.   Plus the staff is very friendly and helpful.   Essayez quelque chose de nouveau. Yum."}
{"text":"I had never heard of cachitos but decided to stop in when looking for something new. They're basically a simple baked bread with some sort of filling but that doesn't mean they aren't tasty! I tried the gruyere with jelly (guava? I don't speak French so hard to say) and the shredded chicken (served with an herb mayo) and both were real good. This is a great place to pick up a snack when on the go."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of good reviews on Yelp and bookmarked it before we went to Montreal. Its a great little place. Very tasty. Its good for breakfast and snack as its not suited for anything else. They have couple of tables inside and outside. I had cheese and chicken with some sort of pastry...very different and tasty. Very friendly owners..they seems to be very busy during early afternoon...snack time... I recommend it. You have to try.."}
{"text":"Great little local Venezuelan food. Owners are exceptionally friendly. The chicken stew and guava cheese cachitos are amazing. Definitely recommend for a new experience."}
{"text":"Excellent cachitos from Venezuela. They have the traditional ham cachito and new flavors that are out of this world"}
{"text":"The place is tiny with only a few tables so it's more of a takeout place. But it is better than I last remembered. There's nothing really special about cachitos. Just a flaky pastry with a filling inside. I had a chorizo + cheese and a guava + cheese. They hit the spot at $4.25 each but not something I would get often. I actually liked their mini tres leches dessert more."}
{"text":"Cachitos is a great establishment. The owners are super friendly and willing to chat with you.  it really feels like the old Venezuelan times when people will go out to panaderias to eat breakfast.  The cachitos are even better than what you find in Venezuela. Flavors are good but not overpowering.  Favorite flavors are ham & cheese, cheese and salmon. Never really tried the sweet versions so I can speak of them.  Getting there about 20 minutes after opening will most likely guarantee a warm, fluffy cachitos.  A must stop for my family when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I was very happy to discover Cachito's in Montreal. It was authentically Venezuelan. The service was very friendly. The food simple, but tasty. Cachito's is on my to-do list for the next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"These things are delicious. We came both days that we were in Montreal during our last stay. There's quite a few different flavours, and they are in the $3-4 range. I think one per person is good for bfast. We shared a few different types and all were good.   Tastes kind of like a cross between a croissant and a pretzel I'd say.   Staff is friendly. Accepts credit"}
{"text":"So delicious, so affordable, so portable!  We were so lucky my sister found this on yelp. It was about a half mile from our hotel, so we wandered over in the morning in our under-caffeinated and over-hungry state. There was construction all over the street but luckily we found it without a problem. One of the owners was there cooking and setting up, and she actually offered us samples since we said we had never had cachitos before and they were delicious! They are this slightly sweet, denser crescent roll-type-looking thing filled with various things, both savory and sweet. We got a little sampling of flavors, including pulled pork, ham & cheese, smoked salmon, and the veggie one (oh gosh, spinach I think?) and a guava to share and they were all great and only about $4 each. What a steal!  We loved it so much I came back the day we were leaving town to take a train to New York and got 2 whole boxes of them to go! We added on the chocolate one, the beef and cheddar, and got more of the same from before. We had a round for breakfast and a couple more rounds for lunch and snack while we were on the train and they kept pretty well all day. I mean, obviously not as delicious as when they first popped out of the oven, but still really tasty. And did I mention portable? And affordable? I spent like $50 on cachitos and they lasted the 4 of us all day. Pretty bomb.   Highly recommend this place! Go right now!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, never had Venezuelan food before - this was incredible though. Spectacularly well prepared, very friendly staff, and the Frappes are a pleasantly great surprise. Lots of vegetarian options, the soup was good, and if you come between 11-15:00 you can get two cachitos, a drink, and soup for $9. Not bad at all and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"A tasty variety of cachitos.  They are inexpensive and tasty but you might have to eat more than one if you don't want to be hungry after.   Many of them were hot and for a flavor that was sold out, they were happy to make a new batch and they were ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Yummy pretzel-like dough wrapped around filling of your choice.  We had the Bacon & Ham, and Ham & Cheese, along with mini lemon and lime tartletts.   Warm, slightly chewy, ample filling. They were still warm!  Very Satisfying breakfast!  Bought five more to take home with us."}
{"text":"My trip to Montreal may have ended and I am no longer in the area, but fond memories of my brunch at Cachitos keep playing over and over again in my head.    They have excellent customer service, welcoming you and offering a sample as soon as you walk through the door, enticing you to order.  I ordered the Combo that comes with 2 cachitos (I chose beef and the Spinach-Ricotta), a lentil soup and a beverage.  Everything was really good.  The lentil soup will literally warm you from the inside out.  I really liked the Spinach-Ricotta cachito, but the beef one was a bit dry.   You definitely need the mayo sauce they give you on the side for dipping.    The above fed two of us and we were quite happy-full.   With an extra order of a caffe and a bite-sized dulce de leche cupcake, our bill rang us up to only $13 for all of this deliciousness!  Seating is limited, so you may have to have a backup plan to take out in case all the tables and chairs are filled."}
{"text":"Wow! I had the Ham and Cheese cachito (literally straight out of the oven), a passionfruit tartlet and a dulce de leche cupcake.....so good! The Cachito was soft, crunchy and sweet and the filling was delicious. I'll be back tomorrow to try the chorizo!  The owner and the other guy working their were super helpful and sweet even though I couldn't speak french!"}
{"text":"though the concept is fairly new for me...cachitos was a pleasant experience...we went there on consecutive days during our montreal visit...  sugar cane lemonade...and the coffee...were to die for...  very friendly staff...the best part is they do not cook them in bulk and store it for display...at any time u can find a max of three cachitos of a kind...you have to wait for 10 mins to get a fresh batch and its totally worth the wait...  they have close 10 different varietals on the offer including the savory and sweet kind...  hot melting cheese with meat/veggies on the inside  inside with the soft bread and a nice bake crunch on the outside."}
{"text":"I've had Cachitos on my bookmarks list for a while now, from back when they were at their old location.  I'm glad I got to try them finally.  I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it.  I went there with my mom.  Our goal on our trip was to try as many places as possible, so we mostly would get an item or 2 and share.  Our waistbands were pretty stretched by the time we were at Cachitos, lol, so we decided we were only going to get 1 cachito and share, but we were having a hard time deciding which one to get.    The ladies working there were really nice and one asked us if it was our first time there.  When we told it that it was, she gave us some samples of the Cheese Cachito.  It was good, the cheese was a little bit stringy and it was mild, not pungent at all (I know that it's probably déclassé to admit this, but I hate strong cheeses.  I'm a brie and mild cheddar kind of girl.  Feta is about as strong as I'll go, lol).  We finally decided on the chicken cachito ($3.95).    The chicken cachito had shredded chicken in it with some spices.  The bun was soft and the chicken was flavourful.  It was good, but didn't wow me.  I think that if I was in the area and wanted a snack that I could easily eat on the go, I would come back for one, but I doubt that I would make a special trip across the city for one.  The place is cute with some bar seating along the wall."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for Venezuelan authenticity, but these cachitos were delicious!  Think of freshly baked , warm from the oven bread stuffed with tasty combinations of ricotta and spinach, or ham, or salmon, or chicken.  All modestly priced at $3 each.  Everything, including desserts, are made onsite."}
{"text":"It is one of the best pastry shops I have ever been to.  The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the cachitos are delicious!  I went to this place because of the reviews on Yelp, and I have to say it has lived up to its reputation."}
{"text":"We took out two cachitos, spinach and cheese. I love the spinach one, and the cheese one is also yummy. The lady there is really nice. When she heard we were first time there, she gave us a slice of the cheese cachito to taste. Unfortunately, I ate them before I realised I forgot to take pictures..."}
{"text":"So delicious. And very friendly service. Had the salmon, and ham and cheese. My son was blown away... \"Whoa, do they make these in the US?\" Maybe Cachitos will expand across the border."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, but nothing special going on food wise. Essentially they have sausages with bread baked around them. There's a few different flavors, and it's adequate. There is nothing going on that most artisinale bakeries don't already do better.   If you are in the area, hungry and want to eat a sausage wit the bun built around it while walking around sure why not. Outside that it's not a destination spot."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant favoris du monde. Je dis toujours que mon diner ideal est un voyage par avion à Montreal seulement pour aller à Cachitos. C'est pas seulement que la cuisine ici est delicieuse - et aussi il y en a des bons options pour les vegetariennes - mais aussi les propriétaires (une famille) sont geniaux et amicable. Je le recommande a tous mes amis qui vont a Montreal. C'est à ne pas manquer."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that this was one of the most pleasant surprises of Montreal. The store itself is quaint and run by very friendly staff. The staff were helpful and eager to let us try samples before buying. The food itself is all homemade and each different cachito is delicious. The drinks are also refreshing and scrumptious. Definitely a must have when visiting Montreal. Love it!"}
{"text":"Looked interesting and so we decided to hit it up with a bunch of friends.  Saw the rave reviews on Yelp and sure enough--it was good.  But it's just cheese in a pastry.  Nothing special.  They're pretty small too.  I paid 13$ for two cheese in pastries.  But hey, it seemed authentic and the owners were friendly.  Really, I just expected more."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I was looking for! The beef and cheese, and ham and cheese cachitos were so good! We had cappuccinos as well that hit the spot. I love the open seating, and the man and women behind the counter were so lovely and helpful. We came for the wifi but we'll be back tomorrow for the grub and hospitality. Great for people watching too."}
{"text":"small baked bread with various stuffs: cheese, bacon, chocolate etc. would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"I went into this with medium expectations. How amazing could a cachito be? Well, the answer is...super amazing! We tried the ham and cheese. So soft and warm. Great treat to go! Really friendly staff, as well. Good value for something so tasty."}
{"text":"We went here early on a Saturday morning while we were in town for the weekend. We were walking by prior to attending yoga, decided we were hungry and walked in. The girl behind the counter was very friendly, we got to talking and she told us all about the Venezuelan food, and her experience in Montreal. I liked the cachitos but wouldn't say I LOVED them. My friends did though so if they were reviewing this could easily shoot up to a 5. It was a cute little spot with about 5 bar stools so I'd recommend it for a quick bite with a small group or take out."}
{"text":"I wish we had this in Toronto! Came here for a quick breakfast on two days out of our four day trip to Montreal. Staff was friendly and cachitos were freshly made. Smoothies were good too!"}
{"text":"Delicious, easy to get to and inexpensive? Where do I sign up?!?  I wish I found this place earlier in my visit to Montréal.  I highly recommend the Ham & Cheese or the Chorizo cachitos.  Meat, cheese stuffed in a soft bread is my kind of meal.  If you enjoy a slight sweet taste, the Guava & cheese cachito is the way to go.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! And super energetic owners/employees. Lovely little shop with cachitos* and pastries. They don't hesitate to make suggestions - my spinach and ricotta was scrumptious, warm, and perfect with whatever small dipping sauce they provided. Love that the same pastries come in both bite size and regular size (my lemon tart was the perfect sweet tangy finish). 'twas a great recommendation (the lady told me her favorite & the best selling goods). Also, there's wifi that works, ac, good coffee, & a chill vibe. Makes me want to study here despite being on vacation.   Oh, and did I mention that they were on the front page of montreal's gazette today?! Made me smile to see how stoked they were! Happiness is contagious.   *Cachito - [kah-chee-toh] a small horn shaped bread native to Venezuela, that is traditionally filled with ham or cheese"}
{"text":"Every single morning of our trip to Montreal, we visited Cachitos. They are the best new thing I have tried, so savory but yet sweet depending on the ones you try. My favorite were the spinach and ricotta and the chorizo. The owners and staff members are very knowledgeable and friendly, we were given a sample of their Cachitos when we first found the place, as well as their pure sugar cane sweet lemonade. Delicious. I really hope Carmen and Lilliana make a move down to New York City, because I would be in there every morning for one."}
{"text":"We went here twice in the week we were visiting Montreal and had a great experience both times. The staff was friendly and welcoming from the moment you walk through the door, all smiles and speaking french, english , and spanish! The cachitos are prepped and baked fresh here and they consist of a super soft long roll stuffed with delicious fillings like chorizo, ground beef, chocolate, or chicken and cheese...we had all of the above and enjoyed every single bite! They also have great pastries, smoothies,and coffee. This is a cute little shop with a few seats inside in a bit of a sketchy area but not unsafe in any way. They seem to appeal to both business men/women & also the local construction workers...I am guessing because it's fresh, quick, delicious, and served with a great attitude from a happy crew."}
{"text":"Quel mignon petit restaurant, leurs pains fourrés sont excellents. La dernière fois la cassière chantait en me servant et j'ai quitté l'endroit en souriant.  Parfait pour remonter le moral ou pour boucher un coin!"}
{"text":"First came here with my girlfriend 2 years ago on vacation in Montreal. Later we moved here and I'd be lying if I said cachitos wasn't a factor in our decision. It's very well priced (depending on your appetite you'll pay 5-15 dollars), and it's become my favorite food of all time. If it's your first time you NEED to try the ham and cheese cachito. All the flavors are good but ham and cheese is your starting point. Personally, i wasnt a big fan of the ones without cheese, like pulled pork, but thats just my preference. The staff (and the owners in particular) are super friendly. Ive brought plenty of friends here and none left disappointed. If you're in the area you HAVE to try it at least once, and I promise you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"The kids and I loved this place, the service was so welcoming. I had the spinach cachito and the kids had ham and one with just cheese. All three were very good and we left satisfied. It's the perfect on the go meal. My son called it a giant cheese stick. They asked if we can try to make them when we get back home We can try but doubt they will come out the same. We wish they had one in Chicago."}
{"text":"We stayed at a hotel about two blocks away. Found this spot through Yelp. Awesome for breakfast. Neighborhood appears unsafe so I wouldn't recommend walking during off-peak hours. There are homeless people here and there. Avoid eye contact!   Once you entered the establishment, all is well. Friendly staff. We never had a cachitos so the server sliced sample pieces for us. It was delicious. Small pastries with different kind of fillings and cheese in it. Sorta like a empanada. For $3.50, it is a pretty damn good deal.   We tried the beef and the chorizo. Both of them are good. The pastry part is warm and soft, cheese is just the right amount without overpowering the meat, and the meat is well seasoned. It comes with a mayo garlic type sauce. Done. Good for breakfast. Good for afterwork snack. Get it with a cup of coffee. Will definitely return..."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for breakfast or brunch. They don't have much to choose from. But the bread is a must try.  Since it comes with 8 different fillings, you will find one agreeing with you, sweet or savory.  The special drink made from sugar cane is worthy trying too.  I had one bread, beef cheddar, and it is pretty filling. My husband could barely have two. Maybe a little heavy for someone since it is a deep fried pastry."}
{"text":"FIRST!! I can't believe no one else has reviewed this place, but c'est la vie I guess ; ) Happy to say that everything about this place was fabulous - the service, the selection and the sandwiches. I was a little dubious about these sandwiches being anything special - \"stuffed croissants!\" I scoffed, but *how wrong I was*.. The poulet sandwich seriously made my mouth orgasm.   I can't imagine a better breakfast in Montréal if you don't have time for a fancier (and more expensive) place. Absolutely loved it, and I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Cachitos are delicious sandwhich-like snacks! Although small compared to what I expected, they are great for tasting various flavors in one sitting. The salmon as well as their cheese cachitos are simply delicious.  I believe the staff is partly composed of family members and they were not only very informative about their unique product, but they also were a delight to talk to. I would highly recommend you give this place a try, especially since, as far as I know, there is no other place to get Cachitos in Montreal!"}
{"text":"By chance my friend and I walked by on their opening day (think they moved/re-opened) October 11th, 2016.   It's a very small yet bright space (so much so that turning around can be a challenge), but it packs in a nice little selection of Venezuelan/Latin inspired baked food and dessert treats.  No arepas we were told, but we did share the spinach and Parmesan filled Cachitos (a Venezuelan hot pocket of sorts). It was wrapped in a delicate, though quite munch-able, dough with a not too salty filling. You can get a small creamy dipping sauce (not sure what the spice was, and hard to dip while walking) with it at no charge.  They have about a dozen fillings on display (not in stock at all times) from what I could see. Ranging from cheese only, to cheese and meat combinations, to some with fruit or chocolate. Most are about $3.95-4.25 plus taxes.  The second visit we tried the most popular we were told - ham and cheese, with its semi-melty, semi-firm, mild tasting Latin style queso. This one was  slightly better with the dipping sauce.  Noted and took out a set of dulce de leche filled soft crumbly butter cookies ($3+taxes). They also have very neat looking cupcakes, tartlets and tres leches cake. Lots of yum in that area.  A little pricey, but for the freshness, cleanliness and deliciousness...well you decide. Gracias."}
{"text":"Cachitos is fabulous!! As soon as you enter in the place, you get to smell freshly baked bread. It smells even better than in all the other bakeries. Then, the super friendly staff will explain you what is a cachito - a sort of baguette filled with cheese, or meat, etc. So much better than anything I could have expected. Perhaps because it was late and the afternoon and I was very hungry, but it was really one of the most delicious thing I've got to eat in my life. And by the way, their coffee is awesome!! ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, very glad my girl found this place. Their bagels are amazing. They cook them perfectly and have so many varieties inside, you will fine what you crave for sure. It is a very small shop but you can tell they love what they do. trust them when they make a recommendation for you."}
{"text":"These brioches are awesome. I tried cheese, ham and cheese, cheese and guava. I love everyone of them. The dough is soft and always freshly baked. Think of them as wonderful soft pillows... A definite must-try. I actually go out of my way to get a few when I have a craving.   Place is clean. Service is super friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't know what cachitos were before finding this place. So happy to have found it. These slightly sweet brioches with savoury fillings are outstanding. My favourite is the classic ham and cheese. Perfection."}
{"text":"great choriqueso, lime tarts and limonade made with sugar cane, the owner and staff are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Cachitos is a great place to go for lunch. You walk in and there are a couple of tables and a glass case full of the \"cachitos\". The cachitos are really good, interesting, fancier hot pockets.  You have your choice of many different types, from ham and cheese, to spinach and ricotta and even dessert types. We got the ham and cheese, spinach and ricotta, a special chicken one (don't remember the name), and the home-made chorizo one. Our favorites were the ham and cheese and spinach and ricotta.  The roll-ups and all freshly made and are quite filling.  This is a unique (Venezuelan-type), cheap walk-up food place. Very interesting place to try."}
{"text":"BonBon ($2.25) Espresso with Condensed Milk might be one of my favourite espresso drink as dessert.  I were more impressed with the espresso drinks at Cachitos than the actual \"cachitos\" which we ordered were both underwhelming. Spinach with ricotta and parmesan/Jamon y queso (ham and cheese).  Sugar Cane Juice though was refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"In-house chorizo is definitely worth while.  Cafechito coffee with condensed milk is a real treat.  Americans may think they see a bagel-dog, but they need to realize that this bread is perhaps 75% baguette, 15% croissant (some kind of butter or egg white on the exterior), and 10% magic.  We liked the art hanging on the restaurant walls, so the proprietors asked us to see the murals on the downstairs walls. Cachitos takes \"gracious\" and \"charming\" to the next level.  Nowhere in Montreal did I see anyone cooler than the guy with the Stetson hat, Oakley sunglasses, biker's leather jacket, and a kilt."}
{"text":"not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical about the rave reviews -- place doesn't really look like anything spectacular -- but I was hungry, and though I'm on a tight budget I really don't want to eat in freakin' McDonald's in Montreal, so I decided to give it a try, and was not at all disappointed.  as others have said, when I came in the guy manning the counter asked if I'd had cachitos before, and when I said no he offered me a sample of the basic cheese one (delicious).  I got the lunch combo -- two cachitos, soup or salad, drink for something like 10.24 -- with ham & cheese and chorizo & cheese, and couldn't even finish (not for lack of trying, but those things are FILLING); one (under $4) would probably be enough for breakfast or a smallish lunch.  I'm only in town for a few more days and may come back for breakfast or to try one of the sweet ones.  super nice people, super delicious, convenient, cheap -- what's not to love?"}
{"text":"holy molly how cool is this place not only the cachitos are great and make me oh so home sick for my natal venezuela but in addition to the typical ham and cheese cachitos they have a plethora of more exotic ones that are sure to please the coffee is pretty fantastic too do yourself a favor and tried the cafechito and service is very friendly to boot a little piece of venezuela in montreal"}
