{"text":"This place has the best take out around. You will not find better quality and portions for the price,there's no question about it. My friends and I have ordered from this place countless times and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"After my 9-Man Volleyball practices, some of my teammates and I used to go here for some after practice eats. It's hidden within this little plaza off Sheppard Ave. The name used to be \"Kenny's Noodle\". Not sure why they changed it?

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
- Baked Deep Fried Pork on rice with cheese"}
{"text":"A good place for casual HK style food....congees, noodles, baked rice or spaghetti dishes, and other transitional HK good eats. 

The place/environ is nothing to write home about. Service is efficient but don't expect the staff to stop and chat with you, their goal is to maximize table turns by getting you in/out quickly. I don't mind at all. 

Food is pretty good. Lobsters or shrimps baked in a cheesy-white sauce over rice or spaghetti are popular, so is the spicy beef noodle soup made with Shanghai-style ramen noodles or rice noodles. Tried ox tails in red wine sauce, it's looks like a soup-y stew, tastes so-so. 

Fixed price multi-course set dinner is a good value. You get to select 3 or 4 or 5 dishes from a list of 30 entrees. 

If you are in the neighbourhood and looking for HK style food, give this Kenny's a go."}
{"text":"Mmm..I try to go here every time I go back to Toronto..their food is sooooo good!  I especially LOVE their fish noodles.  They use fish paste and squeeze it through a ricer or something to make fish paste noodles - then they boil it in broth and serve it together with vermichelli.  This is my kind of soul food!!!!"}
{"text":"With so many options in toronto i was overwhelmed.  A friend of mine told me specificly about this place and glad he did.  Food was great with everthing i could think of to eat with very big portions."}
{"text":"Delicious, best hot and sour soup I've ever had--loaded with seafood and perfect heat.  It's hard to go wrong here."}
