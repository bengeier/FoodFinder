{"text":"Price wise good however the rice wasn't good, it was under cooked. The yogurt sauce wasn't same as I tried middle eastern or Mediterranean  sauces elsewhere. Service was good that's why it will be unfair to give them less than 3 stars ***"}
{"text":"Yum...they have delicious gyros and baklava for a decent price. I've been coming here since they opened and the owners are very friendly :)"}
{"text":"One of the best gyro joints I've been to. The tzatziki sauce is on point. Highly recommended giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I got a great chicken gyro for under $6. I didn't expect much from this place in this area, but I was pleasantly surprised. Probably the best chicken gyro I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean cuisine we've tried! The food is flavorful and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"They seemed to have somewhat improved their customer service.  I have to say though, their food is outstanding especially their gyro salads. I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"We go to the 19th ave and Northern location...they are outstanding.  Food is delicious and worth the little wait you may experience.  Staff is very nice.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"The cilantro jalapeño hummus was worth the trip. Gyro was STUFFED with meat and very tasty. Kind of in a sketchy neighborhood, but the food was delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"To be fair, we didn't eat there. We went in and the place reeked of that orange spray. We still tried to man through it and preceded through the cracked walls, dirty floor, and blinding flourescent lights. When we got up to the counter, the worker said, \"Everything is to go.\" it was 30 minutes til close. More concerning... the counter smelled like sewage. so we turned around and got out of there."}
{"text":"Went in here yesterday to check it out because of the \"People Love Us On Yelp\" sticker in the window. That sticker has never led me astray before this experience! 

Yes, the menu was extensive, the staff was friendly, and the place was clean, but I was completely underwhelmed. I had a gyro and it was decent, but could have used more veggies on it! Although the restaurant was clean, it was not very inviting, maybe it was the lighting or 90s decor? Not sure, but it was odd to be eating in a place that was completely empty. Overall it just could have been a better experience.

Also- humorous sighting of the day- \"fish and chips\" is listed under the vegetarian part of the menu :)"}
{"text":"I don't review many places but I am very torn about this place.  I had the wings which were actually pretty good and priced fairly.  I had my 1 year old with me and I let her walk around while I waited.  She tripped and fell on her hands and when I picked her up her hands were completely black from dirt on the floor.  I figured it was evening and they probably don't clean much until closing so I wasn't too bothered.  I brought my entire family back a week later to dine-in and the high chairs were all broken and completely sticky and greasy.  The tables had remnants of previous guests and I decided to go eat somewhere else.  I worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen when the front of house is gross.  Maybe I watch kitchen nightmares too much.  I would happily eat there again but not in it's current condition.  It's too bad because the wings are good."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery.

The food was decent at best. The customer service is great. I'm a picky customer, I am allergic to tomatos so I always ask people to keep them off whatever I'm ordering, they definitely did that. However, I asked for the tsatziki on the side (of my gyro) and they didn't include any at all, not a big deal. Mistakes happen. When I opened the container of the hummus I ordered, it looked like someone vomited in a to-go box. It was horrible. The gyro itself wasn't bad, but sans the tsatziki, it was bland (that's me being nice). Definitely won't order from here again. Like I said, great customer service for the most part, horrible food. Yuck."}
{"text":"I had the #6 Chicken Pita Shawiri today for lunch with a Salad. The chicken was nicely seasoned and the flavor combination with the sauce was excellent!  Very pleased with the food, the service, and the price."}
{"text":"Their food is subpar compared to similar spots. I went there like 6 months ago and the experience was bad, their gyros was awful. Like 2 weeks ago I decided to give them another try while I was in the area. I ordered combination plate, it was so bad that I threw most of it away. The kebab was dry and the falafel was just terrible. Overall, below average food."}
{"text":"Damn man this place is fire. Came after class hungry as can be and they saved my day. This yellow rice stuff is fire. The meat I don't even know how to pronounce... FIRE. The wings are fire too. Wasn't expecting that though. But yes I would highly recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Would love to give 5 stars, because the food usually is just that or more. But, we went in for our weekly dinner and came home with a bag of greasy oily gyros...dripping wet and soaked all the way through the bag too. We have always had a nice dinner, never rushed always willing to wait the extra time without complaining but this time it was busy, a long wait, and to tell you the truth....RUDE service.  We were handed the bag (we didnt come in for dinner to go) at closing time in a way that left us thinking, why did we bother coming here for dinner to be treated so rudely and then get a bag full of oil covered gyros.  The restaurant could use a good cleaning too, and someone needs to fix the wobbly tables. Really not sure if it is worth driving there each week, time to find a better place to spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"They're good gyros and chicken gyros. Nothing special but been here twice snd ill gi back."}
{"text":"Dropped in mid-day. Had spanikopita appetizer, gyro, and a chicken shawarma.  It was the first time having a chix shawarma, and for us we won't have again.  The regular gyro was good, plenty of meat; would have liked smaller onions. The appetizer was good as well.  The french fries are awesome!!  It wouldn't be complete without some baklava, and it was darn good. The cinnamon flavor really shined.  We will return!"}
{"text":"As others have said, deliveries are on the rough side, i have ordered there about 4 times and they still have a hard time finding me, i have to get out and wave for that to happen. There are apps for delivery drivers, useful for guidance and directions.
Once, i ordered and they brought me the wrong item. They did the right thing and issued a refund. Was peeved but that happens. Another time I order and 15 minutes later i get a call saying it can't be done, the driver is sick. That was annoying, if deliveries can't be done they should make that clear so we don't waste our time; which they did on the eat24 app after hanging up with me. Not sure I'll order from there again. Food is decent, although once the chicken was undercooked in some spots."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a pita! I placed an order to go for the chicken shwarma pita and greek salad combo. The pita was more like a tortilla very thin and falling apart. I could not even take the pita out the wrapper without everything falling out of it. The to go back was full of the garlic sauce. Very disappointed I drove out my way for this. The service was friendly but it does not make up for how disappointed I am with my order. Waste of money."}
{"text":"A really good gyro with lots of tzatziki sauce. They have kids meals. The baklava was delicious."}
{"text":"Great lamb kabobs. I like the draft beers as an option & to top it off the baklava for desert. Excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place! The falafel is awesome...crispy on the outside, moist, light and perfectly seasoned on the inside,,.certainly the best falafel I have ever had.  Same goes for the baba ghannouj, I couldn't believe how great theirs was when I first tasted it; no other baba ghannouj even comes close.  Matter of fact it was so good, that when my pita was gone, I put my lettuce garnish in the spot where it was in the to-go carton and behold, Baba Ghannouj salad!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is pretty dam good. I haven't one thing that didn't impress me. Also you can't beat $5.99 for a Gyros, frys, and a drink. Also had their hummus is really really good, Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chicken Gyro and/or combo plate I have ever had.  MUST have the lentil soup cause you will find no other like it.  REALLY REALLY big fan of Babylon Gyro and the GREAT people who own and operate this establishment."}
{"text":"What a surprise!!!

My 1st time using UberEats.. And the app led me to shako mako..

I luv middle eastern food.. Even used to manage a Lebanese/ Jordanian restaurant with chefs from Iraq. I know good middle eastern food.. And I'm extremely hard to please!!

 Well we ordered:
2× gyros & fries- $5.50 ea
1× falafel pita- $5.99
1× chicken shwarma- $3.00

The price was unbelievable.. I expected horrible food in very small portions..
What I got however..
The portions were very generous first off..
The gyros were delicious, piled high with at least 1/2 pound of meat. We always order with special directions; no onions, no tomatoes, that sort of thing.. And all our special orders were followed perfectly.
I would have liked more sauce, but I didn't want to pay extra for more.
The fries are fresh cut, a little soggy and with some sort of yummy seasoning.
The falafel was perfectly cooked, crisp outter shell, soft And moist inside.
The chicken shwarma was the biggest surprise however.. I have tried to find good shwarma in Phoenix for several years and have been mostly unsuccessful.. The best having been found at Biaz market between Roosevelt and van buren in a horrid area of central Phoenix.
But the chicken shwarma here was both well cooked and wonderfully flavorful. So close to what I've been searching for.
I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!!
5 stars is not enough praise!!

We will be back and referring our friends!!"}
{"text":"The gyros were delicious...the chicken was cooked perfectly...the schwarma was fantastic....I'LL be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Tucked back away for the street in the Albertsons shopping center, you'll find one of the fattest Gyro sandwiches you've ever had! And the customer service is superior! Last time is was in, my side of tzatziki sauce was left out! Bummer! I called and they said that I can come back or next time they would make sure it was replaced at no charge! Sweet! I went in today, two weeks or more later and my tzatziki was there AND a piece of yummy baklava on the house for my trouble! So unexpected but will ensure that I keep on going back for the great food and the great service! So next time you ha e a taste for a gyro or any other Mediterranean food, and quick, try this place!!"}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite teenie, tiny little falafel place... now they've moved down a couple of doors and turned themselves into the substantially larger, but still really good falafel place.  The veggies are always crisp and the onions are sharp. Wrapped in a soft pita and smothered in sauce you can't go wrong with lunch at this (not so little) place."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for anybody to think that this is good Mediterranean or Middle Eastern cuisine. I am from Dearborn Michigan the  largest Middle Eastern community America.I had Middle Eastern food and Mediterranean food made in people's homes that tastes better than this stuff they sell. A diet -conscious friend  and I was hungry so we decided to go there. I ordered the spinach pie thinking it would be good but the spinach pie was deep  and full of grease I never had  spinach pie  deep fried.. It literally made me sick me  to my stomach the guy will meet with like beef shavings wasn't even on authentic shawama bread he didn't even press it to prepare.some pieces of  the meat had had fat on it I orders a fatoush salada that not hard to make that was fair. The cook/owner even got a little upset with me when I was questioning him about the preparation of my sandwich. I would never visit there again and You don't believe me for yourself try some food here and go to another nearby Middle East restaurant that's not too far from them they make real Shawarma,s and try the food there and see for yourself !"}
{"text":"I have been comming to this place for 6 months now. Food and resturant seemed great until my last visit when there was a beetle in my salad, saw it when i was about to take last bite of my plate! I am pregnant and have a toddler who was eating it too. The owner was just blaming it on the lettus supplier. He didn't give me my money back, just said he will take care of me next time, well there wont be a next time!!!"}
{"text":"I have returned and enjoyed the food again as well! Definitely one of the best Gyros in the Valley. And this is coming from a native New Yorker who also lived in Chicago for a couple years. Service was much better this time around as well."}
{"text":"This was my first visit & I just ate the most delicious chicken gyro I've ever had. The pita was so soft & had the most wonderful flavor that I could have eaten it plain. The chicken had a great flavor going on too. I added the best tasting hummus I've ever had, that I got on the side, & this was one substantial gyro. My husband had the Meat Kifta Kabob Sandwich which is also on a pita but the pita is thinner & grilled. He really liked it but will order the thicker Gyro pita in place of the grilled pita next time. The baklava was the best I've had, nice & fresh. I've stopped buying baklava at other places because the nut honey mixture is always hard, but not here, it was moist. The restaurant is small but comfortable & decorated in warm tones & has a nice patio. The food smells are very inviting & make you want to stay awhile. The staff is very friendly & helpful.  I'm glad this restaurant is near my home because I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have worked in the area for 5 years,and these folks are probably the best quality lunch you can find around here.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, rather quick service.  The Greek salad with gyro meat (#41) is so delicious, I haven't swayed from it in three years.  The dining room is always clean.  I highly suggest lunch here!"}
{"text":"I was craving a Greek salad and it's been a while since I've had one and so I looked it up on here and found this place and it is super close to where I live. I got a gyro Greek salad and a side of falafels. Everything was so good and the place was really nice inside and out. Only complaint is the salad needed for feta but that's just me lol I would totally go back.


I went a second time to this place I ordered a head time. Everything was wrong from the order so I had to wait another 20 mins till that was done and the food was not that great. Idk if they had an off day but all I ordered was a Greek salad with gyro meat and a chicken sandwich with fries ugh it was gross."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Tried the kifta kabob plate with a side of gyros. Everything was very, very good. Only giving 4 stars because the pita bread was just a tad hard. Other than that the meal was amazingly good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has bomb gyros. There's a good amount of food for the price. The service is good, as well. I go here often and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"I used to live pretty close to this place and would come here every so often for lunch or dinner.  I was always very happy with my food.  I can't think of a single complaint I have about this place so that's definitely a good sign.  The service is always friendly, the food is as good as any greek food I've tried and the prices are pretty decent."}
{"text":"Solid gyro for the money. Haven't had anything else on the menu. Place is always empty so I'd expect things to move a little quicker and the fries to be not over done. This is the best gyro place in the area however so I'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"I ate there last night, party of four. Had wait of 25 minutes. Food was just OK. Wonder what all reviews saw in this place. Disappointing. Never again."}
{"text":"I hate to give five stars so easily but this is the best gyros and falafel sandwiches in the city. Very good food, comes fast at a good price and the owner smaller husky man is very nice guy. All around good location if you want food from Middle East/Medditarannean, I would recommend to anyone interested"}
{"text":"The Restaurant now at this location is Babylon Gyros & Shish Kabobs and their reviews can be found at http://www.yelp.com/biz/babylon-gyros-and-shish-kabobs-glendale .  

It is for Babylon Gyros & Shish Kabobs that I gave 5 stars! I am originally from Chicagoland, where Greek/ Mediterranean restaurants are as numerous as the stars on a summers night. Places like this have always been my favorite place to go for good tasty comfort food.

The best have always been the family owned places that greet you with a warm smile and friendly attitude, quick service and Great food. And Babylon Gyros & Shish Kabobs fits the bill on every point!

Having just arrived home after thoroughly enjoying a delicious Gryo and Greek salad, I will not only be back, but will become a regular.  My New favorite place in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They always serve a lot of food and great tasting humus. Its clean and food is great. Totally worth paying 8.99 for grilled chicken salad! Meat is always juicy. Me and my husband are regular customers."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ate here for lunch one day. It's simple inexpensive, and good. I give it 3 stars because in my mind 4 and 5 stars are for stellar places with great food and ambiance. If you need some good greek food for a good price this place is the ticket but I'd not go here every week or on a date."}
{"text":"I stopped in just to use a coupon that was expiring.  If all you're expecting is \"OK\" you won't be disappointed.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are size able.  Beyond that, there's no reason to go out of your way to eat here.  I stopped in on a Monday afternoon and must have interrupted someones break.  I ordered a Gyro plate and a baklava.  I had to remind them that the plate came with a drink, then when they brought my meal I had to remind them that I also ordered the baklava.  I don't think they were out to defraud me of a $2 dessert, I just think don't think their hearts are really in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and had just the gyro sandwich.  Really good...the pita was stuffed with flavorful meat, nice and moist.

I'll be by again, have to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that it took some time seeing as they actually cooked the food. Everything looked good but as a vegetarian who can't eat nuts, it was a bit difficult. I realized that I did actually have a  good amount of choices.

It did not come out with the best of smells. To sweet for me.  It was okay for taste but maybe falafels just aren't my thing.  I got falafel and cheese fries. Honestly I could come back."}
{"text":"I work close by and decided I give this place a try, I was very happy with my decision. It's clean it's friendly and the food is phenomenal. You get what you pay for here and it's well worth it. Affordable and such a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern dishes. We have eaten here before and were looking forward to our return visit this weekend. The beef shawarma were excellent. Very reasonable prices for authentic food. Their tahini sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"feeling the need to eat really poorly, I opted for a gyros sandwich instead of a crap Wendy's or Burger King - I wasn't disappointed.

$ 6.95 for gyros and choice of french fries or greek salad. Naturally, I was going disgusting.

Gyros was bulging huge, tummy very, very full, life is very good.

by the way, I think the owner is from Iraq, not that it matters. Also they just moved next door into the corner slot which gives them a lot more seating space (I hope that this matters) and it also gives them much better visibility (probably does matter).

oh - just realized that no Greek high caloric pig out would be complete without baklava...I would bet this baklava would have been great 2 days ago."}
{"text":"2 stars for trying although the grace of a good Groupon deal is also inflating the star count.  The staff was well meaning but more like untrained fast food workers who get put on the grill without watching any of the orientation videos. At least McDonald's employees get uniforms. Our Groupon granted an appetizer but we had a hard time seeing what was on offer with the electronic display board alternating between the appetizer menu and a blank screen every five seconds, so we could only catch glimpses of the dishes and their prices. We settled on the falafel which wasn't bad but the counter girl came out 10 minutes after delivering it to tell us that they were out of one of the entrees we had ordered. We chose something else then spent some time speculating why it took so long for them to tell us. The food was edible but there is much better Mediterranean food to be had elsewhere for the prices they charge. The dining area is shabby although thumbs up for serving the food on decent heavy plastic plates. Like I said, they tried. Two good TVs were tuned to sports which was nice. All in all a place that no one seems to care much about making decent."}
{"text":"Its an okay place for a real quick gyro. Its not the best gyro in Arizona. I think they make their own cucumber sauce. It taste kinda funny to me. I took my wife here I had a beef shawarma it was very tasty  but I wouldn't go back to get another one. She had a gryo but didn't finish it. Its like a one time movie watch for me with this place. Good luck in the future Babylon"}
{"text":"Yum! This is one of the best places in town!  Italian beefs are great here!"}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely horrendous.  My wife ordered a simple sandwich and I had a plate of food.  Took 40 mins for my plate of food to come out and around an hour I canceled my wife's sandwich because it had not come yet.  Each time I spoke with the girl behind the counter I was treated with a serving of attitude, disrespect and a lot of excuses.  I will not be returning and I advise others to avoid them as well."}
{"text":"The sign on the restaurant does not say Shako Mako.

The cashier had some difficulty directing us to the restaurant when we called on the phone.

The pieces of beef I had were not very good. The were too big not very lean.

The sides were OK. Falafel was good."}
{"text":"Got a gyro combo and it was a big plate:) I honestly will be coming back. Side salad was delicious! My bf got the same combo however he doesn't get any veggies in his gyro and he still got a lot of meat! The flavor was good too. Found a great gyro place nearby my house finally! Prices look affordable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was on my way to a different joint but I've been curios about this place for a while.

I won't lie, what made me walk in was the beautiful girl who was behind the counter who is super nice and efficient (the phone was ringing constantly and she was taking orders on site and over the phone).

That being said, I wasn't sure what to order but the guy in front of me ordered the gyro salad and since that sounded kind of healthy I ordered the same.

I was really pleased with the flavor, the presentation, the quality and the price.

I'll go back for sure!

Cheers"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Music too loud until owner reduced!  Must try this place as you will not be disappointed! Oh don't forget to get the coupon deal which I bought a $10 coupon and bought $20 worth of food! Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Gyros! The portions were huge (that's what she said)! I can't wait to come back and try some more of the menu. Good show!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other week. Got the falafel sandwich combo. I like that they had options for the side, just not fries. I got the rice which I enjoyed, also the falafel sandwich was good. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I've always passed this place by and always thought that I should visit someday. Well, today was that day and I'm glad I did. They have the $3 gyros on sale this month and it was really good. I'm definitely going to come back for another one."}
{"text":"OK tried them again not bad little to Americanized for me but the flavor was there of shawarma but would get it again but they service is 5 star I really want to like this place a lot will go back and not shut if they name is gyros house or shaho mako grill"}
{"text":"Delicious! Made to order! Customer service is hit and miss but the food makes up for it! I usually order the Kifta plate to go and it's quite a bit of food for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Checked out this spot while picking my son up from GCU, and although it took a while for my order, and there was no line, I really enjoyed my meal. They offer great portion sizes... and this establishment was clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This a great lunch spot over on the west side. They offer an incredible lunch combo between 1-5pm. I find myself eating here multiple times a week. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this place this afternoon. We had been looking for a gyros joint somewhere near our house since moving back up to the NW valley from Mesa.  Its been a challenge finding good places in various world flavors in the area, so we were thrilled when we found Babylon/Shako Mako. (Anyone care to suggest some killer Indian or Chinese?? I'd give my left kidney for some tasty curry!)

Thanks to extreme pregnancy laziness and a sleeping toddler, I sent my husband out to pick up some gyros for lunch.  The service he said was friendly and pretty fast - he did get back to the house quickly which is an excellent way to quell the hungry preggo rage, thus saving humanity until the next meal.  He also reported back that the shop was nice and clean (I told him this was important for the review when he rolled his eyes at me after asking).  We need those details!

As for the important part - the food! - I got the gyros and he ordered the chicken shawarma, we both got sides of rice.  I almost took a star since they messed up the order gave him the meat shawarma instead, but he loved it and said he didn't even care because it was so tasty.  Really, that's a petty thing to take a star off for anyway.  We'll chalk up that poor idea to hormones.  Ahem.  Moving on.  On my part, the gyros were like happiness in my mouth, the meat was perfect and piled high and the pita was perfect, nothing was off about it at all.  The rice was nice and fluffy, flavorful and also a huge portion - we could have shared one side and been satisfied.  It was all so good that I ate everything and am now inching my way toward an epic food coma.  So much for my afternoon to-do list!

For our money, at $5 for each sandwich and $1.69 for the sides of rice, I'd say we got a smoking deal.  All in all, I think we've found our local shop for some tasty gyros goodness!  If you're in the area, go check them out."}
{"text":"This place was great! They have a large selection of meats and  sides. I went with the beef/lamb combo while the Hub's went with the traditional strip meat (sorry I don't know what it is called) and both were flavorful and delicious. The vegetables on them were crisp and fresh. I had the salad as a side and it was almost large enough to be an entrée and, to our pleasant surprise, the French fries my husband had were hand cut! The prices are super reasonable and they have beer, always an added bonus."}
{"text":"Everything was great except we tried Falafel 4 the 1st time n didn't like it n they didn't offer us anything else or the money back but I would still go back just wish they would've made it right"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise, stopped by between jobs and ended up ordering more than I can eat. Food is big and honest if that makes sense. It was slow so I got my food in 8 or so minutes. They gave me ml the dolman while I waited."}
{"text":"Middle Eastern student at GCC, got hungry and found this gem. 

I was on a bit of a time strap, (10 minute wait for a falafel, 10 minutes till the next class started...scarfed that down as quick as I could), I wasn't expecting it to be that good. 

Great service and tables were clean. Bread was a bit flat (I'm used to greek pita not the homemade style). 

Baklava was a bit sweet for my taste, but I suppose it's made for the average Joe's palette."}
{"text":"Delicious & inexpensive. Gyro meal 5.99 right now. I've never had to wait long for my food. Seems to be very clean. The dessert they had on the counter...I forget the name, however very good & sweet. I've been there 3 times in the past 2 weeks They are open till 8."}
{"text":"Horrible stink from bathrooms comes out into restaurant and slow service. Will not be going there again!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving only 3 stars because of a rude customer service experience. We work near by and we had a party of 5 go to pick up orders we called in. Altogether we had about 8 orders to pay for separately, lots of business, right. I guess to the cooks in the back who seemed to be management as well acted as if we were a nuisance rather than paying customers. As the cashier was trying to ring each of us up one at a time he started to take orders from people who just walked in by passing all of our party. He even had us wait so the cashier could ring them up! I couldn't understand it. Nonetheless, would not go back after that. I do have to say the gyros are tasty but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Very hidden little place, I walked here from school (GCC). I was craving something healthy and delicious! I received the free sandwitch for checking in along with the chicken kabob Greek salad I ordered (way too much food) after a little confusion with the order,  the food was defenitly worth it!! Hands down the best chicken kabobs I've had! And I've had quite a few from different states and cities! Defenitly recomend it. The charbroil taste defenitly makes all the difference. Next time I'll read the menu before attempting to order, .. I recomend you grab one too before approaching the register :) overal great quality food for a great price!!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here about once a week since finding this amazing place - awesome food, usually order gyros, fried mushrooms, combo plate....all quite tasty!  I would give it five stars but feel the amount of pita is never sufficient for the size of the hummus we get and there's some inconsistency in the sauces we receive - sometimes extra tzadziki(?) sauce is in our order and other times not.  Staff are always pleasant and I foresee us being regular customers as long as the quality of food remains as good as it has been!

**Update, food is still amazingly good and I enjoy the fact that I can order for pickup on Yelp and then send my husband to pick the food up!    I generally order a LOT of food ($50 - 60 each time) and the last time I ordered for pickup an entire meal was not in the bag when hubby got home :("}
{"text":"$6 for their daily special that is filled with generous portions of various meats, rice, hummus, and a salad is an amazing steal.  Not only do you have an abundance of delicious food, it's healthy, fresh, and authentic greek cuisine.  If you have never tried Mediterranean food before, this restaurant is the perfect place to try it out! I highly recommend Shako Mako Grill if you want a delicious, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Very authentic & delicious food!
I ordered the daily combo (chicken shawerma, meat shawerma, chicken kabob, meat kabob, falafel, rice, salad, hummus, pita bread) for a very special price 5.99 Mon-Fri 1-5 pm
It was just PERFECT!!

Moreover, Suzanne the employee that took my order was friendly, professional, courteous & helpful. She treated me right & tipped me to try their garlic sauce which was amazing plus my order was ready in no time.

They also offered me a free 20oz soda for just checking in at Yelp

I would definitely go back alone or with friends to enjoy their great service & food

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Place is smokey as if the hood is not working.  Chicken Gyro sandwich was good but the Gyro sandwich that we ordered was bot so good, way too much yogurt sauce.  Fries too salty and the wait was too long."}
{"text":"Mobile Yelp app, how I love thee.

On a super busy Wednesday I had about 20 minutes to scarf something down before a meeting.  Using Mobile Yelp I perused the local flavor.  Thinking Greek I chose Gyro's.

Chicken gyro and a large drink:  $7.50.  Not a bad price.

The sandwich was well made and tasty.  The pita was perfectly toasty and light and there was just enough tzatziki sauce.  The chicken was well seasoned and cooked well.

I  will definitely return to Gyro's when I need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Service is amazing, food is fantastic! Pita bread is so soft and tasty! Well worth the traffic hassle to get some yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great gyros and the combo platter is really good $3.00 gyro Tuesday's love the skin on french fries"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" at best.
Based on the other reviews, I have a hard time believing any of them have ever had good food before. We happened to be on this side of town around lunchtime for some reason and found this place. My first impression was not good: mostly deserted shopping center, next to a tattoo parlor, and with a makeshift sign above that just says \"gyros\" (doesn't this place have a name?). After walking in, I immediately regretted it. It looked dirty inside, but they proudly displayed their \"A\" grade on the front door. There were flies and bees flying all over the place and the \"staff\" was not very inviting. 
As for the food, the hummus wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. Mostly tasteless. The chicken kabob was fatty and undercooked; inedible. The tzatziki sauce was too yogurty for my taste. The chicken fingers we ordered for our son tasted (& looked) like it had been sitting in the fry oil for way too long, like put in before the oil was hot. The fries were actually pretty good. Clearly, though, for a place that \"advertises\" that their food takes some time because it is all made from scratch (isn't that what you want at a restaurant that is not McDonalds anyway? Why is this something to brag about? You're supposed to make your food to order! This isn't a cafeteria!), it seemed to be mostly frozen or pre-prepared. That's not to mention the fact that we were the only ones in there and it took way too long for this \"made to order\" food to arrive.
So, to sum up. Yes, this place is bad. We didn't have a terrible experience, but we won't be back... even if we happen to be nearby at lunch time. There have to be better places to spend your money than this."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good Gyro so I decided to stop in and give this place a try. I skipped the lunch special and went right for the #1 with salad. The pita bread was light and fluffy with a bit of a toasted snap to it, the gyro meat was tender and cut into good sized chunks.

Service was fast and staff was friendly, all-in-all a good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The gyros are massive and tasty. The tsakiki is always fresh and they make their tabouli daily. They have a $3 sandwich deal for the summer which blows any fast food place out of the park! Come here... You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"If you come here be sure to try there gyro fries there really big so bring friends or family.  Loved #3 the meat platter amazing!!! Thank you so much shako mako delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great! it's right across the street from Glendale community college. It's also three blocks from where I reside."}
{"text":"As you may have noticed if you have read my reviews, I love me some gyro. The meat, sauce, and bread are just usually a great combo, and it's even better with some feta on top (I was going to go with a \"betta with feta\" joke there, but it felt too forced). I think about half of my reviews are based on Greek restaurants, so I certainly had to check out this joint that was within a few miles of my place. I picked a good time to show up; walking in at 3pm, it was completely empty. That's usually not a great sign, but it made it easy for me to order the gyro special (gryo, fries, soda for $7.30). The wait was short, so I was out the door

I have to say the food itself was just ok. Unrolling the gyro, it really is huge. The bread seems pretty big, but the gryo meat still was overflowing. I don't know how they add onions and tomatoes to this, but good for those people who like them. I dug in, and it was pretty solid. The meat was cooked a little more than I usually like (I'm a \"run it through a warm room\" guy for most meats), but the flavor was still good. The sauce was a little light, and probably could have used another scoop to add to the sandwich. The fries were good; I am not sure what they were cooked in, but they seemed to have a thicker skin, which was good.

Overall, it was a solid meal. I wouldn't say it was my favorite gyro, but for the price, it is worth what you get. If you are around Gyro's House and don't feel like driving north to Chicago Gyro's on Union Hills (definitely a better gyro), I would suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's right around the corner and discovered it as a student at GCC right next door. My family is now hooked! We always get gyro sandwiches on Tuesday's since it's $3 a sandwich (goooood deal!)"}
{"text":"This place is really good! Everything is made fresh including the pita! I have had the salad a few times from here now and it is really good, fresh crisp lettuce, perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken...very good."}
{"text":"Second time here. Have had the chicken gyro and chicken shawarma sandwich. Fries are awesome with whatever seasoning they put on them. Really good food but the floor was sticky like they don't clean it very often so that's why I gave it a 4."}
{"text":"Thanks to YELP, I decided to try Shako Mako Grill. They have a new owner and chef. We tried the Daily Combo which included 1 falafel, 1 kofta patty, grilled chicken kebab and the chicken shwarma, Mediterranean salad, hummus, tzatziki sauce and pita bread. We also ordered a chicken shwarma plate. We used the Yelp Order Pickup feature which worked nicely. There was a little wait for my food to be prepared when I got there. I used my Yelp Check-in which was a free 20 oz fountain drink. It was nice to enjoy a cool drink while I waited.

Shako Mako has a cute outdoor seating area. There is also a nice eat-in area. My family and I enjoyed the kofta patties best as far as the meats were concerned. The shwarma was a little more seasoned than the kebab. The rice was flavorful. We really liked the flavor of the salad and the hummus. The star of the show was the tzatziki sauce which was nice and creamy and not runny at all. We loved it so much that we licked out containers clean. Three plates came up to $33. It was a nice Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"The Gryos are 3.00!!! 3.00! They are tender and delicious. The French fries are home made , the hummus was fresh and also made in house. The salad was fresh and delicious. Really great! Will definitely back again."}
{"text":"Really slow service but good food.  I was here later so maybe that's a factor of why they were slow, but there was no one in line ahead of me.   Anyway,  the gyros are good.  It's weird that they have hot wings but hey, whatever.  Fries are fresh cut homemade and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Arizona when a buddy of mine asked if i wanted to go to a very good Mediterranean place called Babylon Gyros. I told him yeah and im glade i did because this place is delicious! First of all the customer service is great and they have what is called a Babylon Burger in which you get a monstrous burger with gyros meat and all the condiments you like. They top it off with what is called taziki sauce and it sure is good! Before i left Arizona I had to go back to Babylon Gyros one more time. This time i had a combination plate with Chicken and Beef kabob with rice and a side salad. It also was very good and i had to eat everything on my plate even though i was full from all the food you get. Price is very fair and If anyone is looking for a really good restaurant, then this is the place."}
{"text":"The gyro has large strips of soft meat that kind of melts in your mouth.  Great lunch value overall with a salad and drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat at more than reasonably prices. The owners are amazing and always a pleasure to talk to. Homemade baklava or gyros are a must if it's your first time!"}
{"text":"When new owners took over Babylon Gyros in the commercial center at the northeast corner of 59th Av and Olive Av, they wanted to rename it Shako Mako Grill. But they decided to keep the Babylon name because people are familiar with it and just appended Shako Mako to the name.

I came here a week ago with my friend and fellow yelper John M. I tried the lamb shish kabob platter, which was really good. John also let me sample some of his grilled salmon plate, and it was also pleasing.  I returned a few days later to try their Daily Combo Special (available from 1 pm to 5 pm) and wow - this is one very good deal! For $5.99 + tax, you get meat kifta kabob, grilled chicken, meat shawarma, chicken shawarma, a crispy falafel, rice, and salad; it also comes with a warm pita cut into quarters. It's a lot of good food for so little money.

Service is very friendly and the place itself is basic, clean, and bright. I also received a loyalty card for accumulating bonus points, which is good because I know I'll be coming here frequently."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review and making it five stars. I guess they got rid of their delivery service, which was the only thing I had complaints about before. I'm glad they did that, because this restaurant is of a higher caliber than somewhere that would offer delivery. When your food is this good, people will come to you. 

Tonight, we came in and ordered food to go for the whole family. What I really love about this restaurant is that they have options for people who may not enjpy Mediterranean food as much as the rest of us. My brother-in-law, for example, loves their honey hot wings. 

The rest of us ordered the Daily Combo, which I have had before, and tonight convinced my partner and mother-in-law to try. If you get in M-F before 5, this deal is like $6, but even at the regular price of ten bucks it's a great bargain. You get generous samplings of gyro, chicken shawarma, falafel, grilled chicken (which is tender and juicy) and kifta (which I'm used to calling qofta and my Lebanese friends call kefta. Different countries, different names, similar recipes) all over saffron rice with salad, hummus and pita. It is VERY filling and a wonderful choice for people like me who can't decide what they want. It's also great for helping people decide what their favorite is. My partner, for example, is now a big fan of kifta.

The service I got tonight was great! While waiting for my order I heard Bianka, the cashier, confirming with the chef that he had everything correct, as I ordered it. Did she know I'd be writing a Yelp review? Either way, kudos to her.

This is now, and will continue to be, my go-to restaurant. It's affordable, delicious, and in a very convenient Glendale location."}
{"text":"The food isnt bad but the service is. I ordered my food but when my roomate went to order the lady behind the counter just walked away. We tried to get her attention and she ignored us until she was ready to come back to the register and take his order. I ordered a coke only to be disappointed that the soda machine did not have any carbonation. I tpld her about the soda machcine and she didnt do anything about it or tell anyone about it. After she was done taking orders at the register she came and told us that her boss wasnt there and they couldnt do anything about it. She didnt even put up a sign that the soda machine is out of order. I was pretty much finished with my food by the time my roomate got his food. Will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Our food was served hot and fresh. I got a chicken shawarma sandwich meal and my boyfriend ordered a gyro sandwich. The portions are great! The fries that came with my meal were so much that we just shared my fries and still felt it was alot. And the meat in the sandwich were generously fair. I've been to other gyro places that didn't give as much as we received today. We had lunch here on a Tuesday which on Tuesdays they have $3 sandwich specials. I'd definitely recommend this place because the lady at the register and younger boy were very friendly and the food is worth to check out."}
{"text":"They are THE best..gyro meat is thickly sliced and tender not overcooked and dry. Hummus freshly made..baba ganoush is the best ever. Chunky and on point with Tahinni and lemon juice flavors. I drive 40+ mins just to pick up food for my family because they are the best we've had since our friends had their restaurant. They can get very busy 9nlu downfall but order 30 mins ahead of time and you should be good. Try it out, you will not be disappointed if you like legit ethnic taste."}
{"text":"Just finished my to go meal. And i gotta say they earn a new regular customer. I have been plenty of times at the Shako Mako over in Glendale and i could honestly say that its the same quality and freshness in this location as well.

Ordered:
$5.99 Rice Bowl - with Gyro(extra meat for $2)
$6.99 Daily Combo - (its not on the menu but they have it available). Comes with rice, salad, hummus, pita, grilled chicken, chicken shawarma, beef kifta kabob, gyros and falafel. 

Daily combo is the way to go if you want a little of everything. The rice bowl was equipped with a ton of rice and meat! Of course it was split amongst two of us and we now have lunch for tomorrow.

The reviews for this place are misleading. Most are from the precious place Gyros House. But done be fooled by them this is an authentic Shako Mako.

Service is always good at Glendale's Shako Mako and this location was not different. The girl in the counter was extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. I would give it more stars except the gyro meat was on the dry side (my guess it was on the spit too long) and a bit more cucumber sause could have helped.  Great french fries! tasty baklava.

Coming from back east, its not the best greek food I've eaten but for Arizona not bad at all."}
{"text":"We found this little gem through restaurant.com and then looking up reviews on it from there.  We want to try the chicken next, but the Gyros are awesome."}
{"text":"I tried the place again and im happy with them again. They been nice people and havent suck every penny."}
{"text":"Try the chicken and beef combo plate! It's the perfect size and portion of salad (with legit chunks of feta and whole olives), rice (not too much, not too little), velvet smooth hummus and juicy protein. I loved that the pita was warmed up. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fidel at the Olive location is awesome.  His food and hospitality are number one in my book.  Great Humus made the real way"}
{"text":"I decided to order delivery from this place a few days ago because I don't have a car right now. I liked the easy online ordering and the tracking your order feature. However I did not like the over an hour wait. I stood outside waiting and saw the woman speed past my place a few times. Then she called me and asked me what she should do since she couldn't find me. I was so aggravated by this point I should have canceled but it was late and I was hungry. So after she turned back and eventually found my place without me having to send up a flare surprisingly she hands me a bag of cold food. I asked her if I got some kind of discount for her being late and she laughed so I gave her my money. She starts to walk away and I ask her for my change. She was totally offended that I wanted my $8. I had planned on tipping her but when she went back to her car and started talking about me to whoever was with her I said forget that! Now the food wasn't bad but it was cold and I didn't get the extras I asked for but was charged for. Bottom line it's not a bad place but I don't see myself ordering from here again. The only thing I really enjoyed out of that whole meal was the salad. So I guess all I can say is try the delivery at your own risk."}
{"text":"Delish .. Loved it ,, Lots of meat on the Gyro... Fries were not really Crispy But I am ok with that... And they were very nice too"}
{"text":"My suggestion: spend 3 or 4 quiet minutes looking around before you order. You can stand in one place. Notice the floor, the decorations, the fake plants, the ceiling. Take it all in. THEN decide if this is a place you want to eat food from. I should have taken the hint when I walked in and there were no other customers there on a Saturday during the noon hour. Unfortunately I was dead set on supporting a local rather than chain establishment that day. And with no one to slow me down, I ordered right away. Only after ordering did I take in the grimy scene. The place is disturbingly unclean looking.

The gyro was large but plain and average in flavor - a bit too greasy. Fries were overcooked, hardly any salt, and old tasting. 

The service was uninspired and actually slow despite no other customers being there. It seemed like we were a bother.

My two boys were okay later, but I had some intestinal distress during the window of time that would point to this meal.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Best Gyros place in Arizona !!!! The food is very good, and they have great costumer service."}
{"text":"I was a frequent patron when I lived nearby bit moved a couple of years ago. I found myself on this side of town and decided to have dinner. It was not busy, a woman in the dining area waiting for a to go order and no other patrons. Of the dozen tables in the dining room, more than half were dirty, either with baskets and utensils on them and/or had clearly not been wiped down. The food prep and grill area used to be visible but is now blocked from view by an opaque Diamondbacks advertisement, which I find a little discerning. 

I attempted to order the beef shawarma but was told they were out so I got the chicken kabob pita. Chicken was flavored well but was dry and tough. The salad was fresh and had the right amount of dressing. The pita was soggy and lacked any flavor. 

Overall not a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Place is delicious. Meat is flavorful and moist. Sauce is very fresh and tasty. Had the lunch special offers great deal, gyro fries and a drink for 5.99! Great place! The hot guys in the back can definitely cook! Lol good job. Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Loved the place, typical little fast food Greek. Falafel combo plate was excellent. Also tried the lambs kabob. Very tasty but a little tough, though we didn't leave any behind! LOL"}
{"text":"Good location. Not too busy.  Food is great and price reasonable.  Would recommend to drop by if you tired of MacDonald and burger king"}
{"text":"We just tried this place tonight and I thought it was AMAZING!  I LOVE the homemade French fries! They let me taste the hummus and baba ghannoug (I had no idea what the baba ghannoug was, but it's a dip for pita bread) they were BOTH AMAZING and it's all HOMEMADE!   THE GYROS were BOMB and the homemade tzaiki sauce was great too!  I will DEFINITELY go back!"}
{"text":"Quite a selection for their menu. The gyros always hit the spot! They have a selection of traditional lamb, double, Fire Fighter. & chicken. And they're having $3 meat gyros 1st Tuesday each month (not sure how long they will offer this special, but goodie for now!). Pleasant interior and nice outdoor dining are as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! We live really close, and my brothers and I go at least two or three times a month. The prices are good for the amount of food, and everything we have tried has tasted great. I usually get the $6.99 gyro combo with fries and a drink. I also like to get either the hummus or the babaganoush with pita bread to go with the meal. My brother likes the $8.99 combo plate which comes with rice, a salad, and three or four types of meat. I think that during happy hour the special is only $5.99. The staff is very friendly, and they are always willing to change an order or make adjustments. For example, I don't like tomatoes or onions on my gyro. Once they forgot to make it without, and they quickly got me a new one when I let them know. A great place to grab a quick delicious bite!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food. Great service. A new favorite for me! I definitely recommend just a regular gyro with basmati rice on the side."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp! Group of 5 of us walked in around 7:30pm. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Ordering process was easy and the menu had pictures which is always a plus when trying new food!  They cook everything to order. So once you order you have to sit and wait 5-10 minutes depending on what you ordered! 

Everyone pretty much had something different! Everyone loved what they ordered. I had the gyro combo (fries and a drink) and it cost me $7.50.

Will be going back again before I leave Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Chicken Schwarma hummus plate. Traditional Gyro. Delish, reasonably priced Friendly, Fast, consistent.  Two thumbs up from the whole family (that's a rare occasion!)"}
{"text":"Stopped to get a quick bite. Before I head home. 
The cashier was kinda off. She had me wait while she was on the phone. Gave me my drink but there was no ice in the ice machine. Wanted to flavor my Sierra Mist but they were out, she said that the manager \"forgot to refill it. Waited about 20 mins for my food. I was only there for a gyro .. 
If the gyro wasn't so good I would have given it a 2 star!"}
{"text":"This place is my number two gyro spot for lunch near work.

The pita can be dry, but it's never bad. Although it tends to fall apart.
Their gyro is good, middle of the road, reliable. It's tasty and cut well.
They've had a problem or two getting little intricacies of orders down, but that's usually when we're ordering for the office, and I give them some wiggle room because of that.

The staff is cool and friendly. The restaurant itself is clean and has decent style. There are tvs and nice private areas to eat, so it's definitely worth more to eat in.

This is probably a three star review if I eat there once. But we order here often and their consistency and willingness to put up with an office worth of orders gives them a big bump.

Again, not a must have, but definitely comes up regularly in lunch conversations."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  We went on a Sunday afternoon right after the gym at LA Fitness on Northern Ave.  The people working that day were very nice, but the food was just average.  We had a shawarma/gyro combo plate and a meat kifta plate.  The yellow rice was good and the kifta was tasty, but the shawarma/gyro meat seemed a little dry and crumbly.  Probably will stop by again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, not too expensive. As a place for students of Glendale Community College across the street, it's great. My college student grandson agreed!"}
{"text":"Great service. Wonderful food. If you are looking for some great Mediterranean food in Glendale definately come here."}
{"text":"Great food. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Plan on waiting. Or spending 10 minutes on hold, only to hear 1/2 hour for pickup. Happens too much. Sad because I really like the food."}
{"text":"I've become a little obsessed with this place. I cannot get enough of their chicken gyro. Meat has great flavor and is almost moist. Their taziki sauce is so good I actually ask for extra and put it on everything. It's so fresh tasting with the dill and cucumber. I stop by anytime I'm in the central Glendale area. The only thing that I didn't like was that I had recently bought an online coupon and when I came to use it they didn't seem too sure how to apply it. It took awhile but eventually they got it figured out. I'll be back there soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Cool spot.

They tell me the following is vegan:
Rice (it's made with oil, not butter nor chicken stock like many other places)
Hummus
Pitas
Fattoush salad
Falafel
Dolmas
Their spaghetti noodles

We'll be visiting periodically when we're looking for a Mediterranean/Arabic food kick."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent,  I tried the gyro called Shawarma, very delicious.  They also have alot of other great food as well. Come on down and try it today you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So there's no atmosphere here at all. I got the combo plate like everyone was suggesting. And it really is a lot of food for $6. Out of all of them the kifta was the best. Crunchy on the outside but moist and even a little red on the inside, delicious! The rice was bland, schwarma a bit dry, but the Kabob was moist and tender and had flavor. The Tahiti was okay but the Baba ghanouj had no garlic and no taste of lemon at all. I added my own."}
{"text":"hands down the best gyros i have ever had! i am never disappointed. they are packed with meat and are so delicious! they are pretty busy at times but that just goes to show they are good! i recommend going there you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to confirm they have gross food. Customer service isn't terrrrible. BUT the soggy fries.!
Gyro meet was actually impressive. Soggy gyro tho."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Bad food. Not authentic at all. Taste very American. But not as bad as the Persian garden. The rice was not good. It was way too salty. The lamb was overcooked making it tough then undercooked and chewy in the middle. The lamb was too salty. Something about the hummus was off. I don't even know what it was. Their food is just good enough to make you finish your meal against your will. Not authentic middle eastern at all. Maybe the gyro is their staple like most AMERICAN/middle eastern rest's. The Backlawa was dry and disgusting. Not authentic whatsoever. And they forgot to give me my drink."}
{"text":"Always a great Gyro! Great sauce as well. $3.00 on Tuesdays!  The Salads are good.  Decor is a bit old but I'm not eating that.  T.V.s if that floats your boat."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant nestled in the back corner of the Fresh and Easy anchored strip mall on the southwest corner of Olive and 59th Ave. I stopped by for lunch last week and was extremely pleased with everything. The staff was very nice, pleasant to deal with, and fast. I ordered the gyros combo and a side of the lentil soup. The gyros is currently the best I've had in the valley. Everyone must try the lentil soup, it is by the far the best I've EVER had. I will definitely be visiting this restaurant multiple times a month!"}
{"text":"I've always gone to their other location. I honestly didn't know until I got an offer from Five-star that this was their 2nd store. They offer students a 10% discount with ID. The place isn't fancy, but it's clean. Mon-Friday from 1-5pm you can order their self named , Shako Mako Combo , for just $6.99. That's a great deal! Also on Tuesdays a gyro sandwich is just $3. 
KEEP IN MIND THAT THEIR GROUPON OFFERS CANNOT BE USED WITH THESE SPECIALS!!!  So save your Groupons for times when there are no specials!!
I made that mistake. In all fairness the man at the counter tried to warn/explain it to me. I just didn't understand until the GROUPON was already redeemed."}
{"text":"I always talk my fiance into coming here to eat. Everything they have is delicious. My favorite are their lunch specials. Never had a bad experience and definitely recommend this place to eat at any time of the day. Go try it out, see for your self. They have a TV u can watch while your eating. Refill your sodas all you want and relax."}
{"text":"We typically order online and still have to wait when we pick up (few times 15 even 25 minutes over when we were told food would be ready). Wasn't a fan of the chicken gyro, it was really dry even when we paid the extra for extra sauce to be put on,  the beef gyro is amazing though and fries are good too."}
{"text":"This company gets 1 star from me due to my experience as a customer just 10 minutes ago. So I go in to make an order for my mother, one $3.00 gyro. I go to my seat, close to the door and wait for my order to be called. I notice there are 4 others waiting for their food, 2 ordered their meals to go, 2 ordered their meals to consume there. As each order is ready, the cashier Yasmin, delivers each order to the other patrons, who btw, were not African American like myself. One of the patrons was even waiting on his food closer to the door than myself and she happily delivered his food to him. When it came to me, I was called up to come and get my food. I guess I wasn't worthy of the delivery service. Now I know some people throw race in very frequently when they feel they have been slighted, I'm not 1 of those people but I can't see any other reason for why I didn't get the same treatment as everyone else. I could have made an issue while I was there but lucky for the establishment, I was tired and ready to go home. Needless to say though, they will never get my business!!"}
{"text":"Babylon Gyros is owned and managed by a PERFECTLY charming man and his children. For that reason alone I'd be a fan.

BG is a dine in establishment served quickly. Not high on atmosphere but meant to serve a business lunch or easy meal. However, the space is super clean and easy to find.

The menu is long enough to feel like you could go back several times for different choices but the truth is that it is nicely focused and not overwhelming without feeling slim and boring. I don't eat red meat and I don't feel left out of this place's offerings.

Gyros are salty. No way around it. Let's get that straight. But these Gyros are DELISH. The chicken is not the kind where you feel like you sort of had a Gyro, sort of, but not really. It's chicken that's been seasoned, formed and sliced thicker than what is typical of the lamb. And it's good. Very good. The pita's are that perfect kind of puffed yumminess that makes you rather sad when you've swallowed the last bite. 

The lentil soup, to me, is the star of this place. I would drive the 20 minutes JUST for the soup. I'd drive in the throes of the flu or common cold for this soup. It is really that good. You've had lentil soup, but you haven't had lentil soup yet. Go here, then you've had lentil soup. 

Made by hand, right here, with a whole lot of love. As a matter of fact, don't even eat it, just smell it. You'll know what I mean. It's good. Can you smell that just perfectly matched curry lingering in the background? Yeah, I knew you would.

Ok, now you can taste it. Just be seated first.

There is deep love for this place. I mean really, really deep love.

It's helped by the fact that on my first visit in, my twin and I were each given a piece of baklava as a birthday gift. And the hugs goodbye after both visits.

Yeah. It's love."}
{"text":"My go to gyro spot, and I am lucky enough for it to be super close to home.  I always get the italian beef, and the reason?  It's really darn good!

This establishment is family owned and operated, so you'll always see the same folks when you walk in.  

I'm telling you, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Dope gyros fast service waitresses was nice and polite and the gyros are fat and not greasy and the raise is just right I always get extra meat for 2 dollas..And Tuesdays they have gyros for 3.99$ Can't beat that with baseball bat!! Grilled chicken gyro is bomb as well too!!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, and have had the luxury of living in some cities that have access to said fave food. I also have years of expertise in restaurant mngmt, soooo I humbly admit I know food, you can ask my belly....All I can say is Shawarma King knows whats what, top 3 Falafel I have ever had!!! The Hummus and Tabouli salad were equally amazing. I dont eat meat anymore so I cant give my opinion on those menu items until I buckle, which occasionally happens...Prices were a little higher than what I feel is fair for Phoenix so I wont be going every other day, but monthly yes...I Will report back..."}
{"text":"Mediterranean cuisine in a low brow setting, but the quality is there.  Gyro plate with rice, hummus and pita bread plus a small dinner salad was immensely flavorful AND prepared in a timely manner.  The place is clean.  The people working there are cheerful and welcoming.  Gyro plate is $8.99.  Friend tried grilled chicken plate, which was equally delicious."}
{"text":"Don't ask what the difference between the grilled chicken or chicken shawarma.... lol"}
{"text":"This place will surprise you. It looks like the strip mall restaurant you should avoid. But don't make that mistake. The food is excellent and it is not very expensive. Family meal was wonderful. The hummus is probably the best I've ever had anywhere. I strongly suggest that if you like Mediterranean food that you pay this place a visit. The sign outside of the building says Bevalon gyros. But he's been there for three years and the signage problem doesn't seem to of heard his trade. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"The food was ok, a good reasonable price but it took a little bit long to get it and the dining area was a little bit dirty."}
{"text":"I feel the owner needs to come and check the resteraunt out. Chicken is tough and overly frozen. French fries are fried in old oil. Chicken wings are not in any way done correctly. The employees are nice and just doing there job. I am not upset at employees, I am upset with owner not watching the resteraunt and the food being made. I really feel bad for this place, very unfortunate. I hope the owner will see my message, before it's to late. I am sorry I hate to complain but it has to be said. I would have rather contacted the owner through an email but I can not find any type of contact information, and I don't want to ask the employees because I feel bad for them and don't want to make them feel bad"}
{"text":"I went here today to try something I've never had before. I got the Beef Shawarma, and it was unbelievably good. The seasonings were perfect and unique, and it was filled with meat. The tzatziki sauce was wonderful. I will definitely get more on it next time, but on the size to avoid it getting soggy. It would even go good on the salad. This is a wonderful place to go for something different, with out breaking the bank. The staff was also very nice and answered all my questions so I knew exactly what I was ordering. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great greek food and great place to eat.
The address is actually at 59th and just north of Olive ave."}
{"text":"Went after a family recommendation for a mom & pop place close by. Great food, great price, even my fussiest devoured the whole thing without stopping to breathe. I'm a big fan of mediterranean food and with this place so close, I'll be back often."}
{"text":"I've been here and back a few times, mainly for lack of finding a decent Gyro close to work. While the food is solid, the place could use a really good scrubbing, as it smells like there has been either a grease trap or plumbing backup as of late. While the staff really don't show any sense of urgency or understanding that their lunch patrons have a limited lunch window, they do appear to make every meal with a certain amount of care. If you're looking for a \"quick-bit\", this is not the place for that. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your order even if you're the only customer there."}
{"text":"Tried the plate. The rice is bland and oily, the Greek salad was ok, gyro meet was dry and beef meat was chewy, and calamari comes from a frozen package and was chewy and awful. Much better Greek places out there."}
{"text":"I have been craving this place since my first time and my best friend found a coupon on Groupon so it was the perfect timing to come back! She purchased the Groupon which stated it was a dinner plate for two which retails for $15. 

We went in and as we looked for options, each plate was listed at about $9.99 each! That meant $10 a plate. So honestly the Groupon of a dinner plate for TWO was a false advertisement because there was not ONE option we could've picked that let us both get a dinner plate for the Groupon use. We ended up choosing our plates and had to pay extra because it only covered $15. It was such a disappointment because stating dinner plate for two, they should've had ATLEAST one option that customers couldve chosen from to get the two plates for the coupon. 

Anyway, I decided on the sampler plate which you would assume came with some type of chicken meat or kabob but it didn't. It was my fault for not reading everything that it came with and the picture on top of the menu did me no justice. I unfortunately did not like any of the 3 options the sampler plate came with so I didn't eat my plate at all and shared with my best friend who ordered the grilled chicken. 

It was a disappointment from the confusing of the coupon to the unsatisfying plate. I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Horrible! My wife and I went in there for a quick bite to eat. The service was horrible, the lady behind the register had some sort of attitude. We literally waited 35 minutes to get our food! I had gotten the chicken schwarma and some fried zucchini. We didn't get drinks but wanted water. We were told there were no cups for water and almost we're charged for bottles of water. Guys....there are wayyyyyyyy better places than here. Go somewhere else! Maybe that's why it just says \"Gyro\" instead of their name?"}
{"text":"First thing is the actual name is \"GYROS HOUSE\" (no apostrophe). It does not belong to some guy named \"Gyro\".   

Gyro stuffed to overflowing and happy to not be overwhelmed with an overabundance of onions.  Generous portion of salad too: $6.99 with soft drink.  Decent, filling; Won't leave here hungry or broke. 

Clean, if rather dated, bland interior, probably left over from multiple prior food establishments at that location.   Decent first experience, a filling meal at bargain price.  Extensive Greek-Med menu, low prices will bring me back to try more, but not feeling the fanboy/missionary zeal I'd like to for this family-run establishment located   in the shopping center at NE corner of 19th Ave & Northern, which along with other shops, is suffering greatly already at the onset of a predicted THREE YEARS of light rail construction.  So go support your locally owned, family run restaurant. You may not be overwhelmed with its greatness but you'll get good, filling meal at great price - if you can just get in there.   Probably easiest to enter from west-bound Northern Ave or north-bound 19th Ave."}
{"text":"On three visits everything has been good or better, but the baklava alone is worth the effort to find this little place tucked away in quiet corner shopping strip across from 
Glendale Community College.  The \"Feast for 3-4\" for $38 fed 3 hOngry guys in person and 2 more with the leftovers.  Chicken & beef kabobs especially tasty. Chicken schwarma warma my interior in all the right ways & left me comfortably filled., but the highlight for me I think are those extraordinarily large squares of baklava /baklawa for $1.99: Moist - yet the pastry still flakey  Sweet but not overly so. Just perfect.  

Friendly, walk-up counter service. Food delivered to your table. Get your own paper napkins, silverware & fountain drinks. Clean & simple. Airy & open with the high ceiling and windows on front and one side. Polished concrete floors. Adequate & clean men's room - Ask for restroom keys at the counter.."}
{"text":"Pleasant neighborhood surprise! Always like a solid greek salad and missed my fave from the old neighborhood. His place was fresh, tasty and everything was all around solid. Particularly liked the hummus and grilled chicken both of which were way above average. 

While the decor and location are unlikely to charm, it was clean quiet and neat. The food was defnitelly worthwhile and would return."}
{"text":"My wife picked up a couple of Gyro salads to go. This is one of the best salads I have ever eaten! Serious! The lamb meat was as fresh and tasty as the rest of the salad! My wife said the service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean! So glad we found this place and we will definitely be back! Thank you! :-)"}
{"text":"Back again 5/27/2017 and as usual the food is delicious and the customer service is the best in town from the cooks Frank and Sam to the ladies at the counter Bianca, Madelyn, and Jo Ann all deserve 10 stars 5 isn't enough!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant lobby was just dirt. 
Tables tops sticky."}
{"text":"Small portions and very high prices.  I wouldn't make an effort to come back.  The bathroom was dirty so it makes me worry what the kitchen is like.  The waitress botched my order and when it came out it wasn't wrapped up ( I asked for it to be to go).  The chicken pita had 4 small pieces of chicken, 5 pieces of lettuce and a very large wedge of onion.  The positive, the baklava is pretty good."}
{"text":"All of the food seemed out of a bag from the grocery store. The fries were unseasoned and crinkle-cut, the meat was very dry, and the pita bread seemed very generic and also a bit stale. The customer service was pretty bad - she had her kid playing on the counter and then started talking on the phone when she handed me her food so it was rude of ME to ask for extra tzatziki sauce for my fries (which was chunky and odd anyway). 
Not sure how they're staying in business though there was one other customer in there - it seems they might have wifi for paying customers or he was just killing time on his laptop. 
Overall, would not recommend - there are better places just down northern if you're craving Greek."}
{"text":"Wow! This food is delicious and there is lots of it!! I ordered chicken sharma and fried zucchini and both are delicious. Came with rice, pita and humus. And plus football playing on a large screen TV! Lots of parking. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. Nice friendly folks. I eat there regularly and have not had one bad experience."}
{"text":"I must admit, I'm not from the east coast so to me there are too many gyro places in town.  This one stands out, easily.  It is very good!! Somebody else said something about them grilling the gyro meat after carving it and it makes a big difference as far as taste and texture.  The owner greeted us, and other than a minor (I asked for no onions and got onions) hiccup everything was really good.  The chicken kabobs were made from very fresh chicken and was very moist.  I will be back again when craving a gyro for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try this place since I had a chose favorite. Since it is closer, I figured why not. And I must say, I am happy I tried it. The service is friendly and courteous. The restaurant itself is very presentable, clean and inviting. And the food! The food is great. I finally tried the Baklava and I it was sweet (literally). This is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth, it's so good. As a South African I love savory and meat pies, so I had to try the Spanakopita. A spinach and feta pie that was so nice and flaky, it did not disappoint. I had the combo plate and it was delicious. Good rice, great meat and a fresh salad. They did forget to give me my pita bread, but they did however offer extra pitas on my next order and a free Baklava. They delivered, thanks Frank   All in all, this is a great place with great food and they have great specials. If you love Mediterranean cuisine, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Found this on Yelp and it is a hidden gem! We will return again!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a Greek food snob and this place didn't do it for me.  It's certainly not bad but nothing stood out.  Very flat pita bread with minimum Tzatziki application.  The lettuce didn't seem fresh and their fries are served very undercooked.

On a positive note the seasoning on the fries is good and they were plenty busy.  $7.50 for a drink, Gyro and fries is a fair price."}
{"text":"Was passing by when I spotted the restaurant. Sign showed $3 all sandwiches and gyros. Decided to give it s try. The cashier Denise was very kind and helpful. My gyro came quickly, fresh and warm. A good portion for the price. Very good. Gyro was soft but held together. The meat was delicious. The sauce was perfect. Not over sauced. I want to come again and try the plates and other items on the menu. Yumm"}
{"text":"The food was great will defanantly be back To try more. I got one of the bowls and they are huge. Prices are great."}
{"text":"Good portion of food for the price.  However, their salad lacks substance and dressing blend.  Their meat is cooked well (a bit dry) but lack any kind of flavor.  It doesn't seem like they marinate their meat.  Even rice lack flavor.  I have had better...much better Greek food for that price.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Very good food! I got the combination plate, they there very accommodating on substitutions! It came with hummus, rice, beef kabob, chicken kabob, shawarma, and salad! Priced just under $10 a pound, food came out very fresh and satisfying! Hummus was very authentic, looked like homemade!  Haven't  tried their baklava but look enticing! Definitely will come back when I'm in the area! Keep it up, I hope they do well."}
{"text":"I bring my coworkers here as well it is so delicious and we had a fresh garlic sauce that was something new. I love this place it gets better every time."}
{"text":"It is little pricy but they give you o much meat that it makes up for it.  I have only has the gyros.  The have good food, beer, and wifi great place to go for lunch in between classes at GCC."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Tried the combo plate, girl had the gyro, sooo yummy. They are as good or better than any other greek food around."}
{"text":"Food isn't so bad when you're hungry. But the service is horrendous, the lady at the cashier isn't friendly at all, doesn't make you feel welcome. That and their drink machine NEVER has ice."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my girlfriend because I am obsessed with falafel. This falafel was a little different from others I've tried. I could taste cinnamon and inside was bright green. It was delicious and exciting to taste a different variation than what I'm used to. The baba ganoush and dolmas were also very good. I will have to stop by again next time I'm in Glendale."}
{"text":"Yummy food, not a great selection of beer maintained on tap...laid back, really nice family business, no atmosphere but come as you are works well here."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The customer service is great!  I am slightly addicted to their Chicken Salad and will definitely never go anywhere else to have one. Oh and their Hummus is delish!"}
{"text":"4.99 Gyro deal with fries and drink. Yum!

I am all over this place like nobody's business.

I love me a great gyro.  But to get it at a great price with a clean restaurant and REALLY nice people behind the counter.  I'm all for it. : )

Great job Gyro's House!"}
{"text":"We Tried Shako Mako for the first time last week. We Liked it. Every dish was good. We tried CHICKEN SHISH KABOB. Chicken was tasty.  DH had Chicken GYROS PLATE. He loved the Rice.  Falafel  and Spanakopita as apps. Tons of food. We will go back :)"}
{"text":"Good stuff! This time the groupon proved to be valuable.  We had gyros, traditional and chicken, both were very good.  Would come back if in the neighborhood and recommend highly for anyone who likes to sample the valley's selection of mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mediterranean cuisine! I have tried almost every vegetarian and seafood dish on the menu, and I love it all. The Wraps are excellent and easy to eat, and they will explain the dishes. Very helpful, clean and reasonable prices.  They have a wide variety of foods for both meat eaters and vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"Very nice find, I'm a big fan of Gyros, restaurant was clean, staff friendly and helpful.  Generous portion of gyro meat and side of rice, everything was fresh and delicious. Location is nice, full windows all around the restaurant, and two big screen TVs.  Soda pop is served in cans, I would prefer a soda fountain. I will visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I don't know how the rest of the menu is but I come to this location quite often for an amazing gyro.  The are also so very nice and great people. I definitely recommend this place for there gyros and the baklava. Thank you for what you guys do!"}
{"text":"Great food. Even though the dining room is not 5 stars, it is a really good place to go. So glad there is a place like this on the west side."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best for gyros!!! I've visited ones in Tempe and Scottsdale, but they were either too salty or too greasy!!! They even have authentic Chicago style pizza puffs, which I couldn't find in PHOENIX!"}
{"text":"The $3.00 Gyro is an excellent deal. its huge and makes two meals for me because I'm thin and don't have a large appetite. The Baba ganough is really tasty too. get the large. its a much better deal."}
{"text":"I went here with a yelp deal.  The service was great, the food was very good.  I had a gyro and my mom had a vegetarian platter.  The portions were generous and very tasty.  I will be back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"I thought the prices were very reasonable and the gyros tops in my book! So full of meat, great sauce, heavy on the veggies...heavenly. When you get the fries, it's too much food, which I rarely say! 
Never knew it was tucked back there. I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered two of the Chicken Shawarma meals and it was delish! We have lived in the area for a long time and never stopped here but I am glad we decided to try it. Ordered online and it was ready really fast. They also give a student discount. This will be a regular in our \"need to pick up dinner\" locations. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Try the fire fighter gyros if you're not afraid of spice, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The prices are great, especially since they made all sandwiches only $3. It's one of my favorite stops for lunch, you can't beat authentic Greek."}
{"text":"As a first timer looking for a local \"something different\" the meat wast very tasty, no problem from the staff getting it as a special order, I ordered a traditional gyro plate, it came with a simple, fresh, awesome simple Greek salad, just greens, olives and feta with the cucumbers for this guy. Fresh pita, and great texture to the rice! New favorite spot, close to home and cost effective! I recommend giving it a try. I don't post often, but when I do, it's with enthusiasm and well worth it!"}
{"text":"I recently started at this place. Regularly pick chicken shawrma wraps. Its just jucy n delicious. Regret having not checked out this place earlier being so close to my place :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout today and I still waiting for over 20 mins to get my three gyros. Other customers have ordered ahead of me and seen there order go out ahead mine. The cook gets the individuals out first before he starts the so called large order. I would never come here if you have a large group. Their Purchase order system is unorganized."}
{"text":"Ugh!!!!! What is wrong with this place? Under new ownership I have tried to go there 5 times during times they are scheduled to be open and only twice have they been open. One time I had 14 people ready to eat at 5pm but, bam, closed early! Their food may be good, but I have tried to throw money at this place and have run into their \"closed early\" sign too many times. I've run into that sign at 12 noon!! From now on, when I'm hungry, I'll be going somewhere I know will be open if they say they are. 
Great food
Terribly unreliable...it's literally a roll of the dice if they're open."}
{"text":"I like the gyros. Gyros are hard to mess up, and when I can't get them anywhere else for several miles you're going to get my business. I'm also liking the extended hours, and the bottled drink selection. I like that they've kept some variety, and you can try a sampler plate with items you won't normally see, even at other gyro shops. Like spanakopita, or some of that other stuff wrapped in grape leaves that I can't spell or pronounce (dolmathakia?). I didn't care for the fries, falafel, or rice, but hey--ya win some, ya lose some.

*forced smile*

I legitimately think this place is good for lunch. Just...please, don't remind me how awesome it was under previous ownership. I don't want to live in the past. I hope the owners will at least put on ESPN instead of children's TV while I eat. You know, for old times' sake."}
{"text":"Good gyro...decent restaurant. ... enjoyed my lunch...don't let the  construction Turn you away from this spot"}
{"text":"Small, clean, restaurant, and great staff. Love the food,  bit of a wait, but worth it. Will have to update post when I try their gyro's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gyro place of all time!  I've been going here for about 4 years now whenever I need my gyro fix.  I usually get the #12 - gyro dinner.  It comes with a small greek salad (with bell pepper, red onion, greek olives, cucumber, and feta cheese with lettuce), strips of gyro meat (and plenty of it), and rice (plenty of that too).  Seriously two people could probably eat this meal together if you purchased an appetizer as well."}
{"text":"Alot of food for the price. I get the chicken kabob plate & it's good for 2 meals for me. Lots of chicken, rice, hummus, Greek salad, pita bread & garlic sauce. Staff is very friendly & accommodating. Great offers too! I got $12 worth of food for 6 bucks, & a free piece of baklava for checking in. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Maybe it should be 4.5 stars as the falafal was a little over cooked. But everything else on the plate was amazing. I had the Combo Plate, a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had the steak kabob plate. The salad and rice was good. The steak was tough."}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek food in a spot you'd never expect.  Gryro's House is super tiny.  And it's filled with only a few tables.  The two guys at the counter had to of been brothers, as they seemed to be bickering in another language (Greek?) but in a good natured way.  

It somehow added to the experience and enabled me to pretend I wasn't living in Arizona through a sweltering 115 degree summer- instead, I was dining in a little restaurant in Greece.  That fantasy lasted until a lady busted through the door with visible sweat stains under her arms and on her stomach, demanding that her lamb gyro be covered in ranch sauce.

Ahhh Arizona."}
{"text":"NE corner of 59th and Olive - tucked in the corner, Shako Mako has a nice little dining room and outdoor patio. They make everything fresh so if you are in a hurry, call ahead. Take out order took 20 minutes. Food was excellent and a great value. 

They are not visible from the road.  Pull in behind McDonald's and Jack N the Box and you will find Shako Mako tucked away in the corner of the complex, though you cannot miss them, with the great pictures of their plates."}
{"text":"This place is great I love the taste of the food, just realized this is the same company that I found by my school and enjoy (In Glendale). Can't go wrong here, give this place a try. The staff is very friendly at this location"}
{"text":"Shall mako what's up! This place has great food I paid a little more than 12$ for a chicken kabob plate everything had good flavor. It came with Hummus, salad, and rice, and generous toppings. It's across from the school I will recommend highly to students and already have. It's closer than my other Greek food joint, how great I like your food shall mako!! Only thing is 12 something for a quick bite was a tad high, it did include soda though. That being said I should revisit the menu for a cheaper lunch option so I can visit more often now that I enjoy this place. try you won't be disappointed. I'll be back (:"}
{"text":"There's nothing you can't get as far as Greek goes at Babylon Gyros. The food is delicious, its priced to sell, and the staff is very friendly. There is also a check in offer that gets you a gyro for $2.50! Can't beat that...

Overall, I frequent Babylon because of it's delicious eats and cheap prices. If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"In the mood for Greek and stuck at work so Uber eats directed us here. She got $3 gyro and said it was awesome. I got the meat shwairma (sorry for the spelling) combo plate. I believe the meat is beef and lamb. It comes with the really flavorful saffron yellow rice, piled with the meat on top. It was cooked perfectly with a little bark on it. Plus for the side compartments they had hummus  (a bit on the spicy side) and yummy Greek salad on the other side. Salad had oil/vinegar dressing and was delicious. Pita bread on the side. There was enough to make 2 meals with it.  I honestly don't know how the the take out box closed."}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEATS and I when I opened the box, removed the pitta bread and I saw hair on my meat. I had ordered from this place before and it was delicious but after seeing hair on my meat I completely lost my appetite. When I called the restaurant and told the person I had found hair on my meat plate, the girl that answered the phone didn't apologize and just asked me so what do you want to do? Then she said that if I wanted another plate it would have to be tomorrow because they were closing in 30 min. I told her that I honestly I didn't think I could eat the same thing so I just wanted a refund. It just completely killed my appetite: ("}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, fries and greek salad. This place is located at a strip mall with not too much going on but don't let that keep you from coming here. Genuinely nice service and they have rewards you can get pretty good offers from. My husband and I go here once a month...just gotta fulfill my craving for those gyros! Oh yeah, they have other delicious looking Greek food like lamb kabobs and falafel."}
{"text":"Convenient, fast, affordable and tasty is what the Shako Make Grill means to me. I love the Gyro with French fries combo. It's piping hot and made to order. Owner and the staff are also very friendly and strive to give their guests a great experience."}
{"text":"Ok.... I'm always looking for great Greek food, I was in the area thought I'd give this place a try. Figured a simple gyro was like trying the chips & salsa at a Mexican restaurant. The meat was flavorless and really dry, the sauce just ok.  Since that is the majority of a gyro it was really disappointing. The price is not worth me trying this place again. :("}
{"text":"I keep trying this restaurant hoping they will get it right soon...I always go at lunch time, they have a great $5 gyro lunch special....gyros are yummy...I keep attempting to get pita and hummus and a Greek salad for the side...but everytime I get the salad they make it different...one point they stopped putting feta on it, then no red onions, now it's white onions, feta, big half cuts of red tomato, a couple olives and lettuce....for a small salad it's pretty pricey considering its not the traditional Greek salad...just an American version...hummus only comes with one pita as well....great atmosphere, friendly Greek staff....just fix the Greek salad!"}
{"text":"This little rice bowl is $6.99. Too much for so little. I've had way better!! I will say their French fries were really good!!! I'm sorry to say I won't be back. It just didn't impress me much."}
{"text":"Wow! What happened? On my last visit, I found two young girls running the place and things have changed. The gyro was greasy and the bread was stale. The once wonderful fries were cold and rubbery. When I went to fill my drink I found they were out of all but a few of the fountain drinks including ice tea. This makes me sad :( Hopefully, this was just an off day, so I will wait for my next visit to adjust my star rating."}
{"text":"$3 Gyro Tuesdays

I'm so glad I finally tried this mom and pop shop. Portions are large, the gyro meat was delicious and the sauces/hummus was amazing. The service was super fast, I came here on my hour lunch break got my food and finished with time to spare.

I'll definitely be coming back for the Gyro Sandwiches but Im sure everything else tastes great too! 

Environment - 4/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 4/5
Service - 4/5"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker of a good lunch deal.  They have signs all around the plaza for $5.99 gyro combo (gyro+drink+fries or Greek Salad). The gyro was decent but nothing special.  I actually enjoyed the Greek salad more.  It was fresh with the basic cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese.  The dressing was drench yummy goodness. 

They have TV's mounted on a few walls. There are plenty of tables for large groups.  Just a note, at times the service can be slow since they have one person entering the order, cashier, and serving.  

The light rail project on 19th Ave is really hurting many small businesses.  I like to support neighborhood business. I will definitely return to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Yum---we were in the mood for something new for lunch today. I spotted a review in the local paper about this place and checked it out on Yelp (something I now consistently do before going to a new spot).  We were very pleased with the food. I had the chicken sharwerma meal which came with  saffron rice, a very fresh salad, pita and tzatziki. Hubby had the chicken gyro sandwich. The flavors were very good--nicely spiced and obviously fresh ingredients. The staff were very friendly---I suspect it is a family running the business and very hard workers.  I couldn't eat all the food, so will have a tasty dinner tonight with the left-overs. They offered (and I accepted) extra tzatziki when I got the doggy bag.   Will certainly come back to this spot."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten here. Not by choice. In saying that, I decided to order something for pickup using their online feature EAT24. Ordered what I wanted, paid online and it told me exactly when my order would be ready. Went and picked up hot food and it was EXCELLENT!!! I can't believe I waited so long to eat here again. My 4 star review from my last visit has turned to a solid 5 stars. I couldn't have eaten a better meal for my Super Bowl Sunday!"}
{"text":"Luv the Gyros,  Philly Steak and wow for the Kabob Chicken Greek Salad!
The atmosphere is relaxing and patio is delightful!
Has free WI-FI so eat and work on the patio.
Everyone is very friendly"}
{"text":"Wasn't the greatest Greek food we ever tasted. Falafel was ok. Lamb was tough and there was too much salad on the kabob plate. Small fast food place so not for groups."}
{"text":"$5.99 gyro meal is amazing. The gyros are stuffed with delicious meat. I would prefer a little more tzatziki sauce, but thats just personal preference."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. They occasionally forget to give you the side sauces so make sure to check your bag if you're taking it home. Great gyros, falafel, and kebabs. Don't think I've had a bad dish. Sometimes the pita can be a bit stiff so that can be a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I used to go to Greek festivals back in CT, but now I go here because the food is even BETTER! I usually get the beef and lamb shawarma. The sauce is unbeatable."}
{"text":"OK on a straight quality basis I prefer Ali Baba,but only by a bit. The value of Shako though is stunning. Their lunch plate special after 1:00pm may well be the best deal in town. I had hummus, falafel, salad, rice, gyros, schwaerma, and kifta for $6. Couldn't eat it all. It caters to the Glendale College crowd across the street. Does a far better job than Persian Garden across from Phoenix College."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, they really make you feel like you are family. Can't wait until I'm on that side of town again to stop in."}
{"text":"Two stars for consistently great food, but three stars lost for an awful dine in experience tonight. We have dined here or taken out for years. My family dined in today just after 7pm, two hours before they closed. It was a $46 order and I pre-tipped $5, but we didn't have a $51 experience. Never mind they were out of chicken shawarma and falafel and Diet Pepsi, they apologized and substituted the best they could. 

Here's where it went really bad: Right after the food came to the table, one of the workers began mopping the dining room floor. While we were the only customers around, the place is too small to be mopping with strong bleach next to tables where people are eating. Most restaurants wait until the place is closed before breaking out chemical cleaners and we sure wished Shako Mako had. My kids and wife were nauseated by the fumes and we had to take dinner to go. We brought the complaint to staff and were offered a refund, but we declined because it wasn't about the money. The staff said they have to start mopping at 730pm because they close at 9pm. Not sure who makes the rules but this is horrible hospitality. Wait until 9, put chairs on tables and knock out the mopping in no time. No need to ruin the experience of any customers who drop by in the last 90 minutes of their business hours.

We like the food and will likely do takeout again but hope whoever runs this place rethinks the closing procedures to favor the paying customers."}
{"text":"Decent gyros. I had the regular gyros with the combo meal that they offered and it was good. Small place that has some nice decorative art around the atmosphere. It's a good place to go to especially for those that go to GCC."}
{"text":"Awesome new ownership, place was nice and clean. If you want great food and great service, then you've come to the right place!  They make you feel like family and they always greet you when you walk in the restaurant. I highly recommend the gyros sandwich and the shawirma plate. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Sorry not impressed at all with your location at 19th ave and Northern. It's a fast food setting and items that are being advertised are not available like tabouli. The two girls working acted like it wasn't even part of the menu. The young girl cook was asking what was in the plate that I ordered. I ordered the steak kabob plate and the steak was super tough. Not going back sorry."}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town! Great management, great customer service, and a very clean atmosphere. Come here about once a week. Couldn't be more happy with the food too, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had this on my list for months after reading about the after lunch special.  Honestly it was just average.  I had the combination plate on the regular menu and was not impressed with the quality or quantity of food. The chicken was dry and tasteless. Sob!"}
{"text":"Best baklava ever!  The chicken family meal was delicious, seasoned and grilled to perfection! The staff was great, very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Some of the best mediterranean and middle eastern I have ever had! Owner is friendly and takes pride in his food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our to-go order today. We've been going here for years and have seen a decline over the past year. Each visit is inconsistent. Today we placed a pickup order. We arrived to pick it up and had to wait awhile longer before it was done. 

The gyros was dry and cold; the fries were also dry and cold. Again."}
{"text":"Tuesdays here, all Gyros are $3. The order taker greeted me with a smile & was very friendly. I ordered 1 chicken Gyro & 2 lamb Gyros. Both sandwiches had onion, tomatoes & tzatziki sauce. The chicken Gyro was prepared with lettuce on it. Both sandwiches, were prepared with plenty of meat and was very flavorful. The restaurant itself, was roomy with 2 Flat Screen Tv's playing different channels. There is a self serving soda machine and a very colorful display of the menu over the counter. This location also has restrooms. Although, I usually only crave Chinese & Pizza, I'll make a conscious effort to return here and try one of their Gyros Plates....CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet...

Ate here a few weeks back. The food was fantastic. It was the best Mediterranean food I've had in the West Valley for sure. This is a nice family owned mom and pop, so if you're into supporting local places - come here. Or get delivery - they deliver now. The owner was really cool and accommodating - made me feel like I was eating at my own family's house (except better because no one tried to stab me with a fork). 

I'm definitely going to go out of my way to eat here again."}
