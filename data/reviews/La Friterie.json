{"text":"Skip It.

Decided to stop here big mistake. Food was blah no taste and possibly the worst fries I've ever had. Left a sour taste in our mouths I think it's because of the oil it needs to be changed and I got a few raw ones.

Place was very busy but I mostly seen people eating
Hotdogs and fries which I didn't try so I can't judge but the cheese burger wasn't very good it was lacking flavour and the toppings weren't anything to go Gaga about.

They have a ice cream section in the back looks to be pretty popular but again I can't judge didn't try it."}

Faites attention, argent comptant seulement."}
{"text":"A nice, quirky little neighborhood joint that I would recommend for simple fare. They have a range of hot dogs (grilled or the classic steamed), hamburgers, and of course the classic poutine. Very reasonable prices for all. There's a fun dice roll at the register, so you may get your food for free! The owner has a nice sense of humor and the food is well done. In paticular, the poutine had a good balance of ingredients and a spicy (peppery?) brown sauce. The curds weren't very squeaky and mostly in small pieces, but they were abundant and did not melt. A solid stop if you're in town."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick snack we jumped at the chance for a burger and poutine. 2 chicken burgers with cheese and bacon + a medium poutine came out to about $20. Some of their pricing looked great and the pricing of other dishes didn't make sense. Rather than a 1/2 chicken breast as we were expecting, our burgers were flat AF breaded chicken patties. At least there was poutine right? I don't know if its been a while since they changed their fry oil or what but there was a burnt/bitter flavor (I mean it's poutine, wtf). We had to add vinegar to the poutine just to make it edible, and thats saying something. On the upside, they have dice a the cash and if you roll a double 6 you get your meal free."}
