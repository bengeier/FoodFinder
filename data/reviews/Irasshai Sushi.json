{"text":"Solid place for sushi. Been here several times and the Chirashi Don is one of my favourite items.  It's better than Roku which is a complete rip off.  The quality of sushi at Irasshai is top notch.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stay Far Far away!!! Food is not good at all!!! Ordered chicken teriyaki and got mostly chicken skin and fat!! Salmon Sushi cut over thick, smells bad in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"It's our 2nd time dining in here, for me I like the standard sushi they have with average price! They have larger and Verity sushi roll

I find out most people compared Roku with Irasshai, Ruko is good restaurants for sure, and you pay for it.

For my suggestion, if you really like Ruko, handing on there. Irasshai sushi is totally different, she is not 5 stars sushi restaurant, just for middle class family. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Ambience (2/5) - This is a slightly remodelled Opa location. Things seem out of place. Otherwise it's clean and acceptable.

Service (4/5) - Fairly attentive, but not particularly friendly or welcoming.

Food (2.5/5) - Passable sashimi, nigiri, and rolls, but there are some obvious cut corners. Some rolls had abnormally high amounts of lettuce. The cuts of fish in the rolls were clearly bad end pieces. Sashimi seems run of the mill, on the thin and small side.

Value (2/5) - Given the relatively low quality, small portions, and high prices, it's hard to say I feel I got my money's worth.

Overall (2/5) - Go to Roku across the street, which is in every aspect better."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. They only opened a few weeks ago, but their food quality was very good. The best was the sukiyaki. We hadn't had sukiyaki anywhere in a long time, and theirs was really good.  Excellent flavor and presentation.
The egg drop soup has crab in it, which was a surprise to us. 
The tempura was also very good. It had a nice, light, crispy batter and was cooked to perfection. 
Their service needs a little work, but with it being so new I would expect that it will only get better as they find their rhythm.  Overall we quite enjoyed the experience and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now to pick up some lunch and it's always to go! You will notice I eat lunch on the go on a daily basis. 

You are always greeted and the ladies at this location are always so friendly and sweet! Every time I have ordered lunch to go, the ladies automatically bring green tea while I wait! I am not a big fan of tea but it's such a nice touch that they do this.

I have ordered everything from sushi, beef bowls to the tempura! I like something different each time. All have been great. Super tasty, fresh and the service is top notch.  The prices are affordable and they have an excellent selection of items. 

I have uploaded a few photos of the food I have picked up from this place. The place is small and cozy and I am hoping to be able to have a sit down meal here one day. Will be back."}
{"text":"Come here often because it's open later than a lot of the other sushi restaurants near by. I get the three cone deal because of its cheap price (buy 3 get 1 free), and my total comes to 10 dollars every time. They taste wonderful and are greatly crafted, been to other places where the cones fall apart after just one bite. 

The ramen here is great as well, but the flavour is drastically different from normal ramen. A bit on the sweeter side, with a satay pho taste. 

It's a bit small and weirdly decorated, so the place can get really cramped when it's busy. The servers are nice and the chef has served me himself on multiple occasions. Sometimes they seem a little disoriented and don't know what they're doing but it's an overall nice experience and good food.

Edit: Food can take a LONG time to make even if there's only one other table in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a place where my girlfriend and I usually meet up for lunch as it is very quiet and cozy. They have quite the selection Japanese food including sushi, sashimi, udon and various appetizers. Prices are very reasonable and service quick. We also did a take out on party platter and were happy with assortment and quality of sushi we got. Definitely worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"We noticed Irasshai had replaced Opa the other day and gave it a go. The place is solid and made an effort for me as a non-fish eater that I don't normally see.   They made miso without dashi for me.   They put a couple yam tempura on the plate of shrimp tempura so I could have some. These were nice gestures as I've grown to accept I just don't get miso around home anymore so I now have an option.  

Irasshai has some tough sushi competition across the street but I liked that they have a special roll for me here when my selection is a little low elsewhere.  I find the sushi here to be fairly middle of the road in general though.   They have some items I don't recall on local competition menus like yakitori but nothing I can eat or comment on.   

What Irasshai has going for them is that they are solid and reasonably priced.  My former sushi place in this category has jacked the prices isn't good enough for that new bracket so I'm looking for some place new.  I'll have to return to see if Irasshai could be that place but it's in the running for that vacancy."}
{"text":"Incredible food , so quiet in there tho, give them business they have unreal sushi and ramen !!!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Opening up a sushi restaurant in the vicinity of another great one is a courageous endeavour. Unfortunately for Irasshai that endeavour falls short - very short of their neighbouring competition. We ordered a number of items including: salmon sashimi; special scallop, Cajun prawn, unagi, tobiko and shitaki nigiri; house special, crunchy spicy tuna, California and shake skin rolls; grilled squid, spinach gomae, beef tataki, deep fried prawn and chicken udon. 

The prawn was slightly over battered but the sauce wasn't bad. The squid could use more charring on the outside to give it more crunch and depth (it was too rubbery and raw). Spinach was good. Udon was probably the best item with loads of veggies (although asparagus was raw). Salmon sashimi was very average quality. Beef tataki was under seasoned and chewy. The nigiri's were decent but nothing to write home about. The crunchy spicy tuna was flavoured slightly like kimchi topped with full pieces of cornflakes and just felt confused. Salmon skin rolls were topped with pieces of salmon which I've never seen before and definitely could have skipped. 

Overall we paid $160 including tax for the above. The service was great which accounts for the two stars but is really the only saving grace of this restaurant. Maybe it's opening pains but it also took close to 1.5 hours for the food to come out. We left this restaurant with 90% of our food in boxes because we were going to a movie. The food was so abysmal we ended up throwing most of it out.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously really fantastic sushi. Kind of slow when I was there and the waitress was really hovering. But very nice and welcoming. Definitely ordering here more often."}
{"text":"Good for the value. We had the Chicken Udon, Sushi Roll Dinner Box and a few nigiri sushi items off of the sushi list. Everything was pretty good and the portions were big. We had a bunch of left overs to take home. Only complaint that I have is the food takes a while to come out, even when we were the only ones in the restaurant, but that's not a deal breaker (Unless of course you are in a hurry or if you are really hungry!)"}
