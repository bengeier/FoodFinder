{"text":"Tried this place for restaurant week....not impressed. Had a larger party of about 12. Waiter tried to upsell to chefs choice menu and told us the rest. week option wasn't going to be that good. Honestly he was right.....the Brussels sprouts were horrific. Burnt, bitter and not edible. Changed to the salad which was good with ginger dressing. About an hour after our apps we were served our dinners....all but one of my gfs. We all were about finished with our dinners when she finally got hers. To say the least, service was ok. Food was a huge let down. Too expensive and so many places to eat in Charlotte to have such mediocre food."}
{"text":"Been there twice since it opened. Tried about 10 dishes on the menu. I thought it was going to be better the 2nd time, but NOT!  Really way over priced for what you get. Nothing really impressive. They spend a lot of money on wait staff..they are very quick to take away your dishes, even when you are not even done. You wait a long time between dishes...so few of us in the party just sat and watched while others ate their dinner plate. What a mess! If you want to spend that much money, go to Zebra next door and get better food. Or spend less and go to Yama or Cowfish! Will not go back again."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and it is fantastic!!  Have not had a bad tasting item yet.  Start off with edamame and sweet chilli sauce....delicious!!  Remember the portions are smaller and great to share several with friends to make a meal.  Coconut sake....The best!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese food/sushi. Excellent service. Lovely and warm ambiance. The calamari is amazing and tender. The chili edamame was delicious and the wild mushroom Kamamashi pot is a must clean and earthy. Salmon belly was exquisite. We will be back"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and food. The pork belly is to die for and the wine list is impeccable! A must visit in the South Park area!"}
{"text":"I would give ZERO stars if possible. Probably the worst experience of my life. Every single person we encountered were one step below brain dead, our server told us that we couldn't order what we wanted bc \"it's not how we do things\" drinks were bland and wrong, and we spent $260 for dinner that was aweful! I'm all about Tappas but that was just bad! I would recommend against...a total let down and would suggest going to McDonalds. After all, that's what I wanted after I left!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. The food, decor and service were all fabulous. The food is designed for sharing. We started with two small plates: pork dumplings and the glazed chicken wings. They were both excellent. I really enjoyed the fresh lime and coarse salt that was served with the wings. It made the dish very flavorful. We also ordered the salmon and the chef's selection sashimi. The flavor and texture of the salmon was wonderful. It may have been the best salmon I've ever had. The sashimi was also good.  It was cut a little thick for my personal taste, but it was fresh and enjoyable.   The atmosphere is cute (trendy and welcoming). The service was excellent! Our waitress was knowledgeable and made great wine recommendations. Two thumbs up. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for the first time on a Thursday night.  First of all, WOW!  This place was so chic.  The ambiance took me straight to Chelsea NYC a la Hiro Ballroom.  Very cool!  The service was impeccable.  We started out with the delicious white truffle artichokes, moving on to the pork belly and kimchi that was spicy and tasted like the ocean...both delicious, as well.  Next came a special of eggplant and mushroom dumplings.  They were...meh...ok, but my husband loved them, as he is a super-fan of ginger, and me, not so much.  The last course was the wagyu beef tartare that was topped with a quail egg and accompanied with cavier.  Holy crap!  I wasn't wild about the idea of eating raw beef, but my husband said there wasn't another option.  I dove in......and finished most of the dish without sharing.    I can't wait to dine here again and try some other items!"}
{"text":"Kitchen service and management alone should keep you far away from paying $32.00 for a piece of Cod a la carte. The food is good but good is not enough for this type of restaurant and menu. We ordered multiple appetizers to share along with 3 separate entrees and side dishes. We were a table of 3, ordered our drinks and only one arrived with the excuse of, \"the bar is backed up.\" There were very few tables filled since it was early, clearly the bar was not overflowing. Our appetizers came out one by one in a timely fashion.  First to the table was one of the side dishes to our entrees, sweet potatoes. They say there for 10 minutes before an entree arrived. We of course sent them back. Then came one entree, black Cod, $32.00 a la carte. 10 minutes later the second Black Cod arrived, our third person was still sitting with nothing. We finally asked for the manager. We got a a ridiculous excuse of, \"this is a tapas style restaurant your waiter should've explained that to you. I said he didn't have to we've eaten here multiple times before and since we dine all over the country and Europe we can read a menu. It is clearly separated appetizers/entrees/side dishes. In the mean time, while he is arguing his point, our two of three entrees (no side dishes) are still sitting on the table for over 20 minutes.  The ending is our server at least gave us enough respect to acknowledge that our food was poorly timed by the kitchen and they were having problems with service. This alone was the only redeeming quality of ruining my son's birthday dinner. We will NOT be back again."}
{"text":"I went to Baku with a local Charlotte friend who knew I was a foodie and thought I would appreciate this Japanese inspired restaurant.  Upon reaching the front door it was opened for us by a waitress who welcomed us with a smile.  We were seated in the main dining area (there is a lounge-y space upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night around 8:30 pm and the space was surprisingly full.  Subdued in its decorations, perfectly lighted so that you could clearly see what you ordered, the restaurant could easily exist in New York City or any other major metropolitan area.  Service was impeccable - our main waitress was attentive and genuinely enthusiastic.  A bevy of support folks attended our table as well.  It was evident that the owners were rigorous in their expectations for the front of the house and that staff were willing to execute in order to make those expectations happen.  My friend and I decided on a small plates for our meal.  I must say that I was somewhat put off by the voluminous menu; it had to have been 10 pages (including 3 pages of sake and other drinks) as well as 2 additional separate menus of \"specials.\"  So there were 3 menus in all!  I  felt like I needed to have studied and prepared prior to arrival.  It was a little overwhelming.  In the end, I questioned our waitress for recommendations which she was more than happy to do.  Along with cold sake (1/2 price bottles that evening YAY!), we had 8 small plates; each presented with a rigorous attention to detail.  You could tell these were chef conceived items and that he ran a tight ship.  From the sake bottle resting in an ice filled wooden box onward, every element of the food and its presentation is the vision of the chef.  We had first a plate of homemade kimchi, the cabbage tart and vinegary.  It was followed by a Hamachi dish - two thinly sliced pieces of delectably fresh fish atop a pickled mound of crunchy veg.  I would have liked a larger piece of fish as it was dwarfed by the pickled mound and kind of lost.  Charred baby octopus followed, plated in a long white ceramic runway.  Tasty and delicious, it offered a wonderful bite.  A tuna tartare was next, to be scooped up with homemade taro chips.  The chips were an unexpected item, a nice touch - the tartare; weak of seasoning fell flat as merely mushy.  We then had tempura shrimp.  When it came out, I was at first disappointed by the size of the shrimp - smallish and popcorn - like.  But after popping one in my mouth, I was amazed at how they remained so succulent and juicy after being deep-fried.  But they were.  And the tempura batter, thin and crisp, did not overpower.  A really delicious dish.  Next came pork belly with sous vide egg.  The pork belly was prepared nicely, fatty and flavorful.  I was very disappointed in the egg though as it was cold.  I told my waitress to let the chef know as I was sure he did not intend the warmth of the fatty delicious pork belly to be paired and eaten with a refrigerator-cold egg yolk.  I looked at my friend and said just you wait - a chef this meticulous would send us another so that we could enjoy as he intended.  He didn't - oh well.  Last we had scallops with foie gras.   It contained two big meaty succulent sea scallops adorned with slivers of foie gras, some sea salt and pickled plum on the side.  This was a winner; a choreographed ending to the savory portion of the meal.  Lastly, but not least - I had to have a dessert.  I ordered the chocolate ganache  cake with homemade coconut ice cream.  Need I say more?  A brilliant pairing - the cake's center was warm and gooey and the ice cream cold and coconutty - combined the two were unified into a wonderful yummy finale to the meal."}
{"text":"Charlottes new hot spot. Great Japanese food and super cool lounge upstairs. The food is incredible and fun to share.  The duck is a must have!!!@"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night and the ambience inside the restaurant was exciting with the cooks grilling the meats on the right side when you first enter. We sat on the second floor which was quieter than downstairs. We ordered 3 sushi tapas and 3 meat tapas with prices ranging from $7-$30. We got the Rainbow bowl, salmon belly nigiri, spicy hamachi crispy rice roll, wagyu tartar, robata chicken livers and robata pork belly.   The sushi dishes were delicious! Fresh fish and beautiful presentation. The wagyu tartar was over seasoned and was way too salty for our taste. If you have a great piece of wagyu why kill it with all that seasonings?? The robata chicken liver was undercooked and pork belly over cooked. I would come back for the sushi but not robata."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding dinner last night. The food, service and ambiance was fantastic. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday on a Monday night with friends and my boyfriend's coworkers who go here at least once a week because they love it so much. They had half off bottles of wine which was a great way to go for the table. We got a ton of different appetizers, small plates, entrees, etc. to all share. I will admit the miso soup wasn't as warm as I'd like, but the absolute best parts of the meal are the pork belly, the cod, and the salmon. I am not even a big fish person but they are INCREDIBLE. The chocolate dessert was really great too, and overall not a very expensive meal considering how much food we ordered for 6 people. Definitely would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food here is good but definitely (seriously) over priced. The environment is nice but for less than 2/3 of the price here you can get same quality sushi/Japanese fusion dishes at Cowfish, Yama sushi, and Musashi  in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The Taylor Swift knockoff at the hostess stand acted like she was doing us a favor by asking us how she could help. We went for Charlotte Restaurant Week and found the service slow. The food was OK, if not overly Americanized. I would try again but there's much more attentive and friendly service in the area."}
{"text":"I love Baku - Brussels sprouts, skewers, sushi - its all been delicious. It's dark inside so be prepared for that, but service is strong and food/drinks are great. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and so is the ambiance, but the food was just meh."}
{"text":"I was there the first weekend it was open; the food was so-so. It was a bit of a turn off when you walked into the front of the restaurant and the management and possible owners were huddled by the front door - not to greet you, but just being tense.  We ordered white and red miso soups, which were handed to us backwards; which was annoying because we had to listen to a 3 minute speech on each food option on the menu. I get it, your a new place in town, but I can read. The beef tenderloin with asparagus was good, as was the Kurobuta pork and sweet onion dumplings.  I can't say the food was any more flavorful than say Cowfish. The front patio was nicely decorated and had a fun atmosphere. I wish they had some music piping through the outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Second night of Queen's Feast: sorry to say, the experience was less than enjoyable. We were seated upstairs. There was a DJ and the volume was uncomfortably load. Three requests to lower the volume all resulted in the same result, we do not have control of the volume. The service bordered on the rude. The portions were disappointing. The wine was good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the spot during Restaurant week.  The atmosphere is nice.  I sat upstairs at a high top near the bar.  The waiter was great.    Now to the food...The Brussels sprouts were amazing.  I could eat those every week.  The Jidori chicken breast was tender and I loved the sweet potato. And I demolished the green tea creme brûlée.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and still walked out with a bill over $100. The waiter we had was great. He gave lots of good information and was attentive. The food was just okay. It lacked flavor for the most part and we thought it was overpriced for what you get. Also, for the sushi rolls...if you are going to charge $20 for a roll then you should be using the correct rice. Lastly, the hostesses were not very welcoming. When we walked in there were 3 hovered around the hostess stand chatting. We had to get their attention so we could be seated. There were no smiles are how are you doing tonight. The hostesses are a restaurants first impression and the last. Make sure they are friendly so patrons return. Unfortunately we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Very unique food!  The meats are super tender, the sushi is on point and the cocktails are amazing!  Definitely one of the best meals we've had in Charlotte!  We got the pork belly skewers (super rich and great flavor), roasted oysters, Hamachi sushi roll, black cod, and lamb chops.  Everything was perfect!!  Ambiance was good too, not pretentious.  Don't be afraid to ask for a different table if you get seated in a really dark spot!"}
{"text":"So in town for my regular visit from out west and this was the BEST MEAL I've had in months!!  I've been to a couple restaurants similar to Baku in Miami and Los Angles but Baku takes the cake for overall best concept!  We started with the chicken wings and they were probably the best I've ever had and I would say, I'm somewhat of a wings expert!  They were grilled crispy to perfection, the lime juice and salt they give you to sprinkle make the dish!  We had the scallops with smoked duck and they were outstanding!  The sleeper was the Baku salad, which I easily could have eaten a couple extra bowls of.....  For an entree I got the lamb chops and my date got the grilled chicken and both were out of this world!  Overall A++++++     I  read some of the other reviews and don't understand how some people say this place is expensive unless they are Burger King customers.....  Our meal including a fabulous Sake bottle was less than $100!!  GREAT VALUE for what you get!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. The manager knows me as the middle aged business woman that was trying to enjoy a meal with clients before being shouted profanities at by a neighboring table -- words I've never had directed at me before. Management did nothing."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for my birthday dinner with 6 girls. Cocktails, atmosphere, food, and dessert were all amazing! I don't remember our servers name but he was outstanding, very patient and entertaining especially with a rowdy group of women. Thank you Baku for making it a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook good. Probably the best asian place in town. The food is more meat based opposed to sushi based and everything I have ordered from here (normally 6-9 small plates each time) is really good.  It isnt cheap, but it is worth it. We go maybe once a month, but would go more if we could."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Always great service and awesome food. The Blue fin toro tartare is quite delicious. Huge selection of sake. One of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service, atmosphere,  and crafted cocktails!  The food is awesome with intricate and full flavors. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options that are not just a last minute effort to please vegans. Pricey, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I don't even understand how they have a four star rating on here- it has to be from family and friends. We went here for the first time for my husbands birthday because he has been wanting to try it...what a waste! So to start with, the portions were small since you're supposed to share, but the prices were that of a nice restaurant's normal portions. That would have been alright if the food was good, but it was such a let down. Dish after dish was a disappointment. We got desperate and ordered some sushi rolls and even those were eh. Everything was just bland, and the price made it worse. There are just too many amazing restaurants in Charlotte to even bother coming back here- we will not be returning. I will add that the staff was very nice and friendly, though."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this place and finally went on a Friday night and was definitely not worth time/money and it just ruined our dinner. We ordered chicken green onion yakatori and shrimp tempura roll.  We got our order after ~20min of wait. Shrimp tempura roll tasted fine. But chicken yakatori tasted like over burnt \"wood\". Then ordered \"king crab pot\", which came in a fancy pot but no taste to it all(It was priced for $17, but it was not even worth 2$ and I would pay those 2$ for that fancy pot and would not pay a dime for the food). So, I would suggest not to get attracted by the fancy exterior of this place, there are dozens of better food places near by Baku, try them.( in those other places, at least you might not feel like you got ripped off)"}
{"text":"We went here as a group today, Sunday, since it was open later for whatever reason and it. Was. Banginnnnnnn' .  Miss Alex was our server and she was on pointtttt.   Food came out quickly and was soooooooo delicious!!! Presentation was oh so nicely done.  Shall be back for our server Alex, yummy food, AMAZINGGGGG DESSERT, and the sweet corn."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. One of the best if not the best I. Charlotte. I've been three times and each time was memorable. There was a lot of hype about this restaurant and it has lived up to it. So many others are disappointing but I'm a big fan of Baku Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places but honestly after tonight we may never be back. I am all for if servers are busy but the service was terrible, and the excuses were ridiculous. There was one manager that was so sweet but the other manager seemed so disinterested. News flash... We come all the time and were not trying to get free food! We just are not paying that much for food and dealing with incompetence. Sad because after the lack of care or urgency we won't be back. 25 minutes for a beer, wine and a Coke? Really? Wasn't even busy. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night out and was definitely worth it! Ambience was perfect and noise level wasn't too bad. Seems like A great spot for a ni ch the out with friends or date night.  Come with a larger group to share dishes, more of a social setting. Warm towels to start the meal is a tradition I could get used to. Drink list was crafty and tasty. Food, no words do it justice...scrumptious to say the least! Will be back."}
{"text":"Baku has quickly become my wife and I's favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The tapas and sushi are both outstanding, but the steak is hands down some of the best we've ever had.  If you can splurge for the Wagyu I promise you will not regret it, but the American ribeye is great as well. The staff and bartenders are excellent and remember your names, and the cocktails are out of this world.  I would strongly recommend Baku for a date night or just for a fun night out with friends. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night make sure to try the Baku Buns, they are absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"The food we had was great, I really enjoyed everything we ordered. But we had a few issues. We were seated by the hostess at what looked like a bar table, people at the bar kept bumping into us.   The service was energetic, but too much. I may not have eaten at a Japanese Robata before but I have eaten at a restaurant before and I understand the concept of small plates and getting lighter dishes first and then moving on to heavier dishes. All of these concepts (and many more) were explained to us in great detail by our waiter, It was just too much.  He even told me I was eating one dish incorrectly.  He also told us in Japan its considered rude to use the wet cloths they bring out before the food for anything other than cleaning your hands.  Apparently, he was concerned we would take sponge baths in the dining room. So that was special.   I really enjoyed the food itself but the waiter was way too much a part of our dinner, the noise was bad, drinks were slow, and we had no room.  I will go back for the food and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, but if we have the same waiter I will run for the door."}
{"text":"Great food, but unfortunately we had terrible server experience.  Not impressed if I'm willing to pay that much.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This is a review specifically for the Queen's Feast (Charlotte restaurant week).  Some restaurants really give the vibe that they do not enjoy the 10 days of the Queen's Feast.  This is most readily apparent in their menu, where they are outright stingy in their selections of what is available or plaster the menu with upcharges.  Very offputting.  Delightfully, Baku is NOT one of those.   It has a reputation for being a bit spendy, but they really don't hold back on the restaurant week selections.  We thoroughly enjoyed the salad course, the small plate course and the entree course.  Someone looking for volume of food might cast a critical eye -- Baku is a small plate concept.   But we appreciate quality over that and Baku delivered in spades.  The NY Strip was the big winner, though my m-i-l very much enjoyed her salmon.  Excellent preparation and presentation.    Sometimes a wait staff can make the Queen's Feast unpleasant as well, perhaps allowing the smaller check size to sour their attitude.  Again Baku came through with top marks.  Our staff was prompt, accurate and engaging.  Thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to Baku.  We will be back.  This is what restaurant week is supposed to be about."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty amazing and the service is just as phenomenal.  Our waitress knew everything about the food and drink menu, and gave great recommendations.  We must have tried at least 6 small plates, none of which disappointed.  If you find yourself there, try the brussel sprouts, I was craving them for weeks after."}
{"text":"so amazing.   seared scallops with foie gras. a5 wagyu. this giant shrimp looking thing. this mushroom rice hot pot thing.  ok... so I clearly did not participate in the ordering. I just sat there and looked pretty(ish) and ate what was brought. but it was all so so so good. great lighting (helped with looking prettyish), great service, and the place was \"jumping.\""}
{"text":"Baku is outstanding. Have been here 3 times for various business dinners. This is a very interesting robata grill restaurant. The atmosphere is quite casual, but elegant. The menu selections are simply fantastic. All appetizers, entrées etc are great quality and unique. The sushi is terrific. I recommend ordering sushi first for a group, then mix and match a selection of main courses to share across the table. Wine selections are very good. Love this place and will definitely keep going back when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I am dumbfounded by some of these negative reviews. The cocktails are always delicious and the food is insane.  Baku is the best special occasion/ fancy pants dinner spot in town. We've dined downstairs with friends and family -- and found cozy spots upstairs by the bar for a more intimate feel. In my experience, it's best to go with a few people who are down to share, drink, and hang out. On nights that we dine here, Baku is the main event and we've never been disappointed.  Our favorites include: Salmon belly nigiri (the best food ever), Spicy hamachi rice crispy treat, chicken wings (yes, I'm serious), Toro Tar Tare (pricey, but worth it), all of the prawns, wagyu filet, and the black cod. The desserts are pretty good and completely beautiful, but you probably aren't doing Baku right if you still have room for dessert at the end of the meal... just sayin."}
{"text":"On the positive side, our server was phenomenal. Michael went above and beyond to create our dining experience. Second and last positive is the reasonably priced wine and decent selection. The food is good, we did not have a bad dish. Our table of 6 ate tapas style and ate a wide variety from the edamame (delicious chili sauce) to the wagu beef. Unfortunately this is challenging because the portions are so small. Although they encourage tapas sharing, the dishes are barely appropriate for 2 to share. The food did not rock my world, but it was good. Then the bill came. For a table of 6 to spend $1,000 including gratuity, I would expect to be eating Nobu quality food. I have no problem paying for a meal that is outstanding, once in a lifetime experience. Unfortunately, that is not Baku in Southpark. Outrageously priced food.  Unfortunately we will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week last night. It was busy but with our reservation we were sat immediately. Our server Dave was awesome. He was nice and attentive and very informative about the menu. The food was delicious. Brussels sprouts were amazing but so was the pork belly skewer!! Well definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"On the surface I was expecting just expensive sushi but Baku brought is so much more. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Creative and flavorful menu. As soon as my wallet recovers, which I don't begrudge them I will be back in a heartbeat. Expensive is fine if they can deliver and Baku did in every way."}
{"text":"Holy crap Charlotte.... Baku is here. We got into the Pre-Grand Opening event last night and it didn't take long at all for us to fall hardcore in love with Charlotte's only Robata Grill. Chef Michael Shortino and chef Anoosh Shariat have introduced Robata style Japanese cooking to the Queen City with the creation of Baku in Southpark and we were on hand to check out their creation. Robata is a style of grill cooking designed centuries ago that burn a specially sourced smokeless charcoal at over 800 degrees and gives its food a faint but distinct smoky flavor.  We haven't been this excited about a restaurant since the first time we checked out Chima in Uptown. The buildings unappealing exterior is is nowhere near as impressive as its interior decor. The menu features items sourced from local Carolina growers, Robata Meats, Seafood and Vegetables, Skewers, Tempura, Maki Rolls, Sushi/Sashimi, and Desserts. We were instructed to order between 3 - 4 plates each and try to sample various things from across the whole menu. We happily obliged and ordered the:  - Kurobuta Pork and Sweet Onion Dumplings - Assorted Fresh Vegetable Tempura with Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce - Sake Glazed Chicken Wings with Lime and Sancho Salt Flake - Marinated Lamb with Korean Chili and Garlic - Spicy Filet of Beef with Black Pepper Sesame Sauce - Beef Tenderloin and Asparagus Skewers - Sweet Potatoes with Honey and Cinnamon - Local Sweet Corn with Shiso Butter - Baby Back Ribs with Star Anise, Cinnamon, Sweet Chili Glaze and Cashews - Espresso Frangelico Truffles on Almond Florentine with Cinnamon Gingersnap Ice Cream and a Sour Cherry Sauce with Fresh Blackberries.  As a personal challenge to myself I decided I was going to eat everything we ordered with the chopsticks that were provided or my fingers when appropriate... that means absolutely no spoons, forks, or knives. Everything we ate fell in a range between simply delicious to truly mind blowing. The Kurobuta Pork and Sweet Onion Dumplings were soft, juicy, and an easy target for my chopsticks. The Assorted Fresh Vegetable Tempura with Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce was delicious, crunchy (especially the eggplant), and once again an easy target for my chopsticks. The Sake Glazed Chicken Wings with Lime and Sancho Salt Flake were the juiciest pieces of chicken I had ever sank my teeth into, they had a very faint grill flavor from the robata grill, and were an easy target for eating with my fingers. The Marinated Lamb with Korean Chili and Garlic was juicy and with its giant bone was easy to eat with my fingers.  The Spicy Filet of Beef with Black Pepper Sesame Sauce was the real robata star of the night. The beef was both tender and addictive, and gone in seconds via my chopsticks. The Beef Tenderloin and Asparagus Skewers were an unexpected surprise (we didn't order them) and we decided to eat them up before anyone realized the mistake :) The Sweet Potatoes with Honey and Cinnamon were incredibly soft with a faint hint of cinnamon and easy pickings for my chopsticks. My only complaint with the sweet potatoes were that they came with the skin on and when I tried to take a bite of them the skin came completely off and smacked me in the chin :( The Local Sweet Corn with Shiso Butter was crisp, sweet, lightly grilled, and my fingers made easy work of them. The Baby Back Ribs with Star Anise, Cinnamon, Sweet Chili Glaze and Cashews came out a little later than expected but well worth the wait.  For us the best part of the night is always dessert and for our dessert we had the Espresso Frangelico Truffles on Almond Florentine with Cinnamon Gingersnap Ice Cream and a Sour Cherry Sauce with Fresh Blackberries. The presentation was probably the most unique for a dessert we have ever come across. The ice cream was sitting on a block of ice, everything was resting in a bowl of ice, the espresso frangelico truffles were a dark chocolate lovers dream, the almond florentine was incredible, and I really wanted to drink the sour cherry sauce by itself. Dessert really put my chopstick skills to the test but I crushed it. The truffles were easy pickings, the almond florentine went down without a fight, and the ice cream proved to be a little difficult but with a steady hand I made it happen :)  Baku blew us away and is easily one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The robata style cooking is unique, the menu is diverse, and the desserts are top notch. If you're bored with your normal Friday night restaurant check out Baku at Southpark and make sure you don't leave before getting dessert :)"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for an authentic and original concept to come to Charlotte and shake up the food scene in the South Park area. My expectation's were met with much disappointment. While everything was not terribly horrible, the restaurant was an oddity, the atmosphere felt confused and awkward, and the service was-HORRIBLE.  We were greeted by the general manager opening the door, which was nice, but the hostess sat us at a horrible table, when there was literally no one else in the restaurant. With multiple seating options it felt a little ridiculous to be sitting at the first tiny two top against a wall-which just felt unwelcoming. With booths available you think you would want to make your guests comfortable.   The server was the master of up-selling, he brought us out a $6 bottle of Fiji water-and without even presenting it he opened it up and proceeded to poor. Where is the tap water, the other tables had it? He asked if we wanted sparkling water or still water-thought this was synonymous with tap water??He also insisted on \"guiding\" us through the \"dinner experience\"-like I cant order and read for myself. After an odd monologue about Baku-he moved us across the dining room so we would be more \"comfortable.\" That was kind of awkward but I was glad to have a better table.   Food- The calamari was amazing. The calamari was tender, served hot and fresh, with the perfect amount of seasoning, it came with sliced green chillis that added a nice kick of flavor. A little oily but this didn't distract me from enjoying it. 10/10  It went downhill from there-  Scallops with foi gras- Ok, they were amazing as well, but we waited 15 minutes between finishing the calamari and receiving the scallop. I say scallop because it was one scallop cut in half- you think you'd receive more for 19 dollars? It had a nice flavor but the foi gras was not substantial and by the time it got to the table it had melted away, also hard to cut with chopsticks. 6/10  Chicken Skewers with leeks- Ok- came out hot, had a nice smoky flavor from the grill-right amount of sauce, but where were the leeks? It looked like green scallions were substituted for leeks, and this didn't lend the same amount of  appeal and flavor you would experience with actual leeks. 4/10  Duck breast Entree- Nicely rendered piece of duck, cooked properly, it had a smoky flavor and it was nicely done. It lacked seasoning and a sauce. It came with a small dish of chopped plum chunks-which added a nice sweetness but lacked the body of a sauce and didn't adhere to the duck because it was hard and awkward to eat with chopsticks.. This could have been an amazing dish if it had been served with a sauce and hadn't been so difficult to eat. 7/10  -May I mention that our server suggested we order a vegetable to \"cleanse our palet.\"  So I assume this means before the meat course/main entree? We literally waited for 20 minutes after we finished the duck entree for corn on the cob. By this point the meal had ended- and waiting 20 minutes for corn felt silly. Also no one came by our table to ask if we were ok- the server literally disappeared  When he brought it out he had the audacity to say it eats like desert- by that point we just wanted a check and a box for the corn.   Overall-Weird experience. The music was horrible as well-felt like I was at a graduation party. The ambiance felt confused and unestablished.Food was good, but the courses were improperly timed, dishes could have used a little bit of seasoning or at least the server should offer salt and pepper. Service was non-exsistant for most of the experience, the server was nice and \"attentive\" at first but after he took our orders he spent most of his time doing side work making us feel abandoned and awkward- the restaurant was pretty much empty- you think you'd be a little more attentive. The service and experience could have been better-especially since the South Park area has a decent amount of competition for a new restaurant. They need to step it up if they want to survive.    Wouldnt go back. Overall- 5-10  Not worth the price :("}
{"text":"Had a really interesting experience here tonight - could have been a real disaster, but the restaurant management did exactly the right thing and it made every bit of difference.    Went out for dinner with my daughter - special occasion while she was home for the weekend.  We'd been here once before and really liked it, although it is not cheap.  Tonight, the food was terrific.  We had the pork dumplings, which we were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned - terrific.  From there we had the lobster and avocado (sushi) roll.  That was okay, but I never tasted any lobster in it.  Went on to the spicy filet mignon with the mushroom pot and rice.  This thing is a madman - spectacularly tasty and just perfect with the beef and mushrooms.  Did the pork belly skewers which were great with some kimchee and some other stuff that was all terrific.  Food was perfectly prepared, service was great!  So now the problem ...  We were seated at a nice table towards the back of the restaurant.  Behind our table, however, was a booth of four guys in their 40s who were doing some serious drinking.  They were loud from the moment we got there, but as time went on, they became more and more animated.  Their language was disgusting - loaded with f-bombs shouted at the top of their lungs.  I was embarrassed for them, but the longer it went on, the angrier I got.  Long story short, we cut dinner short and let our server know that we needed to get the hell out of there.  She was extremely apologetic - knew exactly what was going on - and got us our check quickly.  The manager came over and apologized again.  He also let us know that he had taken about a third of our check off (much appreciated) and he gave us a $25 gift card for another visit.  In short I think Baku handled this situation just about as well as anyone could have hoped.  We appreciated it and we'll be back."}
{"text":"AWESOME STYLE The food taste great but don't expect to be full. A little lound but not too bad. Simply, it's a really nice bar with small food and big prices.  It would be a nice place to take a date but only if you like yelling a little in conversations."}
{"text":"I have passed Baku many times, wondering what it's like.  A client encouraged me to try it, so we did.  The food was delicious.  Everything we ordered was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  We had the soft shell crab salad, the sea bass skewers, the seared blue fin tuna, the wagyutataki roll, the sea bass entree and another skewer that I can't remember. We also had red and white wine.  The waiter was very nice and helpful.  The wine pours were average and the selection good.  The reason I gave it four stars and not five, is because it's confusing to order.  They have a lot of small plates and honestly, they are just as filling as the entrees, which are small. They are priced similarly, so we ended up over-ordering which was yummy but ran up the bill significantly. The freshness and uniqueness of the menu is almost worth the price. Yes, I said almost, which means I will be back but not next week. The atmosphere, though a little \"cold\" is calming like a spa. I do recommend this place.  It will not disappoint a good Charlotte foodie or a visitor to the area. Compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for a 8:15 reservation for Charlotte Restaurant Week. Just to start off, I would give the food 5 stars, atmosphere 3 stars, and service 5 stars.   We were seated immediately upstairs (right beside a group of stupid loud drunk business men. I mean holy bejesus, i dont know what these guys were drinking but I want one of those!....my husband actually moved around and sat beside me on the couch so I could hear him. This actually worked out better cause we enjoyed our meal chatting and sitting right next to each other cuddling on a comfy couch. I recommend it!) and the waiter came over to do a walk through of the menu and \"how they do things\". This place is true tapas style through and through and I think to enjoy the experience, you have to know that coming in. They bring dishes out as they are ready and it's more of a food experience then meal. (Aka, great for a date like us but probably not the easist for a a group of people trying to just grab dinner). The one thing that irked me some was that he asked if we wanted sparkling or bottled water. Luckily my husband caught of an just requested tap so we werent charged a crap ton for agua. I mean, come on, tap is literally the same thing as bottled and I didnt like that the waiter was kinda deceiving people by only offering those two options. Anyways, I digress.   We ordered a bottle of J Lohr Petit Sirah, which was absolutely amazing! We have actually been to that winery in California and can attest that the bottle price was marked up a fair bit though. Oh well, what can you do about it.   We decided to do the Restaurant Week menu and got the following things (they came out in this order): -Spicy tuna sushi- This roll was so simple but it was really really good. I felt like they used quality sushi in it. It came with 8 pieces, so perfect to split. -Pork Belly with Kimchi- The pork belly came out on two skewers (3 pieces on each). Once again, great for splitting for two. You really could taste the grilled flavor on it and the kimchi was a perfect additive. Second best pork belly I have had in Charlotte! (Soul will alway be numero uno) -Flank Steak- This was the highlight of the night! The steak was cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce with it was amazing. It also came with two sweet potato pieces.....tasted just like sweet potato casserole! Yum. The portion was pretty well sized I thought for tapas -Salmon- The salmon was good but I think we would have enjoyed it more if it came out before the steak cause I think we were in steak heaven at this point -Orange Creme Brule- My favorite dessert; I just love the caramelized sugar on top! Never had orange before but it actually was super subtle and good -Pineapple tart cake with sorbet- My husband's favorite dessert; It had grilled pineapple on top with a super tasty sorbet  The service was spot on through out and the waiter was very knowledgable about our wine and what would pair with it.   All in all, we will definitely be back but probably only for a special occasion, as the prices were pretty high in comparison to other tapas style places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food, the selection is truly great, you can get in and out for a reasonable price or you can go all out and splurge. We had the pork belly, sushi, and giant prawn.  All very well done.  Incredible cocktails and the best saki selection I've ever seen.  I'll definitely do it again."}
{"text":"Baku is unlike anything else in Charlotte.  The food is prepared on Robata and Yakitori grills.  The concept is Japanese-inspired shared plates - presented to the table one at a time so that diners can fully enjoy the flavors of each dish.   We loved being able to try many different dishes, each impeccably prepared and presented beautifully.  Every dish we had was delicious but we especially enjoyed the lamb chops and the pork belly.  The restaurant is gorgeous with gleaming stone walls, textured fiber ceilings, sleek bamboo furniture, vivid art pieces, and perfect lighting.  The upstairs lounge is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but WAY over-priced for quality and amount. The majority of the items we ordered were pretty good. The sushi (maki rolls) on the other hand lacked variety and flavor. Wish there were more options on that menu. I did like the nigri and it was very fresh. I would only recommend this place for special occasions as the price point is so steep."}
{"text":"Was there earlier today had a fantastic dinner!  Teriyaki salmon you almost can't go wrong but my favorite was the lamb chop, probably one of the best I've had.....would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for our anniversary dinner and were very excited. When we arrived we were led to a tiny table upstairs near the bar. Maybe that was the issue? Anyway, the service was terrible. Our waiter did not describe the menu at all; no explanation of how the small plates work, etc.  My hubby and I knew what questions to ask, but the waiter didn't seem to know the menu, or just didn't care.  Anyway, we saw him once after that.  The food was ok, but bland; nothing to go back for. As a former sever myself, I am usually very understanding when a restaurant is busy, and my hubs and I really don't expect much except to be checked on periodically....we didn't even get that, and the restaurant was not busy.  Anyway, we won't be back, but maybe they just had an off night? The drinks were good though, hence the two stars!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place.   Charlotte is a wasteland of decent food options. I have lived here for eight years, and when I took my out of town parents here, my dad replied it was the first good dinner he'd had in Charlotte.   We us amazing sushi, chicken meatballs, ribeye, black cod, and the edamame. All were yummy. The only miss was the crab hot pot.   Get the cod. Get two. You'll be happy you did.   Also, sit upstairs if possible. They have a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for my father in law's birthday dinner.  The ambiance was nice and the server was nice.  However, the food was very normal and over priced.  We ordered a lot of small dishes and the sashimi platter for 4 and the big bone in steak.  The sashimi platter was pretty good and the steak with the different kinds of salt was unique. But all in all, the foods were just way over priced for the taste.   Definitely worth giving it a try but was just not enough for us to be returning."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience. The sushi was excellent and fresh. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the waiter was disgusting.  There was an entree that sold per person, and it said \"minimum 3 persons\". I asked the waiter that if I can order this for two, he said yes.  But eventually he charge me as 3, without any explanation and informing.  I checked the bill, asked him, then he told me that there was something wrong with the POS machine, and he didn't notice that.  But hi poor acting skill told me he knew everything.  Will never go this place again."}
{"text":"Had a party of 10 for a team dinner so all of the food was pre ordered. It was served tapas style and we had about 10 different rounds. All the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly. There was a wide variety of food and all was fresh and flavorful. We sat upstairs and it did get a bit loud but there were several other parties so the atmosphere was about right. If your into tapas than I recommend Baku but if your looking for a traditional meals, this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"The good: the food was really delicious. The bad, waited at least 30 mins for the food to be served and served us the wrong food. We did the omakase thing where the chef chooses the dishes to be served."}
{"text":"I would just like to say that the service here is excellent. My boyfriend took me to Baku for my birthday dinner because I have been wanting to try it so bad. I've heard great things about this restaurant. I came about 30 minutes earlier than my boyfriend so I sat at the bar on the 2nd floor to grab a drink. Monica has to be one of the most greatest bartenders I've met in awhile. She is very easy to talk to. Once my boyfriend arrived, we were served by Maria. She was an excellent server - very respectful & attentive. For the food, we had quite a few things. I honestly don't remember the names of it all but I do remember getting the Brussels sprouts! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING & highly recommendable. I also got the teriyaki chicken which tasted good but I honestly wish it came with rice. I got the Salmon King roll and it is awesome! The flavors just go so well. We also got the spicy tuna Rice Krispies which was different but good. I recommend Baku and will be here again!"}
{"text":"I hosted a dinner program here in the private dining room.  I heard ahead of time that the food was great, so we decided to try it.  Although the food was good, the service was terrible and we were extremely disappointed.    The dinner was on a Thursday night, the servers were not attentive and I had to refill drinks and serve food.  When they brought our food, they did not bring serving utensils.  When we went to finalize the bill, we were overcharged for the gratuity--they gave themselves 29% gratuity and didn't even deserve 10%.  It was awful!  They also charged us for several dishes that we didn't even get.    I do not recommend this venue for private dining functions."}
{"text":"If I could give Baku more than a 5, I totally would!  This place is beyond amazing!  Well worth your time & money!"}
{"text":"WOW. We loved EVERY single dish served. Fantastic. All fresh, wonderfully seasoned.  Pork belly , dumplings, calamari, lobster rolls, edamame and good drinks. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Being Japanese, I know sushi and this sushi wasn't top notch. The butterfish wasn't \"buttery\" but hard to chew. It wasn't super flavorful. However, the cooked items were delicious, notably the cod and scallop dumplings. The sauces for the skewers were great, but again not sure about the quality of everything. Food presentation was great."}
{"text":"I have heard several compliments about Baku so I was happy to finally make it out.  I love the different concept of Baku as I have never experienced a Japanese Kobata grill before.    That night, I ordered the soft shell crab special, which is in season and was flown in that day.  It was my favorite dish of the night.    For a sushi sample, I tried the mushroom roll with the truffle oil.  It was ok.  I originally wanted to Forbidden roll and should have gone with that.   I also ordered the grilled tofu skewers and a side dish of kimchee.  Both were excellent and could make a meal on their own.  After all that I ate, I did not have room for dessert, but I saw the wonderful dessert platters on ice coming out of the kitchen and wish I had room to try one."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on business last week and my associate and I were craving sushi. Based on yelp reviews and our proximity to the restaurant, we headed to Baku expecting a good meal.  I have to say, I wasn't expecting a meal this great.  It was fantastic. From the moment we sat down, the experience was wonderful. Our waiter was that perfect blend of knowledgable, funny, and wry. We knew we were in good hands.   The plates are small and meant to be shared, so we ordered three plates (two rolls and dumplings - all amazing), then asked him to bring us two of his favorites - even better!  It really was a perfect evening of food and wine, each course better than the last. I cannot recommend Baku strongly enough. If I lived in Charlotte, it would be tops on my list.   I hope you go. I know you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Ba-Who I say Ba-Who and the answer is Baku which is a MUST DO.. Corny Huh well I'm so high off good eating that I came up with this chant. This place is AMAZING. The food, The Service, The Ambiance, The people (Staff & Customers).. A to Zinc My girlfriend invited me out to check this place out for a late Birthday outing ( my bday was in August) and I informed her that I had this place bookmarked to try and she ensured me that I would not be disappointed. We sat upstairs in the savvy bar area at the actual bar, the bartender was amazing we talked about everything under the sun including the drinks in which I had a Gin Martini with cucumbers which we so refreshing and tasty.  Chef Vince came up and spoke with us and ask what we did and did not like and he would come up with some platters for us and bring them up personally or send them up via a waitress. SCORE  We started with Tore Tar Tare with a quail egg and rice crispy treats on the side (not your snap crackle and pop over sweeten treat, but instead a steady consistent tasty compliment to the Tare Tare). The quail egg to mix with the Toro Tar Tare was AMAZING it switch up the texture and flavor as I ate a couple scoops prior to adding the quail egg and once it was added OOOOO MMMMM Goodness. Next up came the edamame which we had tossed in spicy sweet sauce which was DE-LIC, next up was Grouper Tempura Yes I said GROUPER TEMPURA. There was a method to eating this as it  was suggested by the server to sprinkle some of the crushed salt provided first then add some ginger she finally some of the dipping sauce that was a perfect method and it was OOO so GOOD. We also had a chef Vince creation sushi roll which I'm sure had salmon. For dessert the chef created a fleet of desserts from Mango cake to 5 Flavors of sorbets to fresh fruits ALL were YUMMY.. I can't wait to have DATENIGHT with my husband here as it was an amazing experience and one of my Top5 in Charlotte for sure easily."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We sat at the bar, had several different appetizers. Everything was delicious and we and had outstanding service! We will be back !! Also, great help was the gentleman that helped us select which sake to have for the evening!"}
{"text":"Well. I will say firstly this was a very unique visit.  It was the second most worst place I've ever visited. Why?   The food was brought out in all different orders and I was eating alone while my wife and others were watching me. They claimed it was because everyone ordered what we did. But the problem with this was every course was the same way.  And to kick this, everything was cold! Had to send it back and even the people serving had no clue where to bring things. They also didn't even tell us what things were. Thank god I was not allergic to tuna or id be in the hospital or worse dead!  Management needs to get fixed here. Before id ever go back again.  The manager attempted to make this \"better\", he wants to give us desert. The desert menu was out of date supposedly and they don't have hot tea. More so, they don't have hot green tea in a Japanese restaurant!  Be warned stay away!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi--we had the yellowtail tuna. Also enjoyed the pot sticker dumplings, which has the best savory sauce. The cocktail menu is unique so I ordered a manadarin orange vodka with yuzu juice, from a Japanese fruit. The drink was sweet like a Midori sour but comes in a small glass. Great service even though we had to wait for food. I would suggest reservations because the kitchen was backed up that night."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my wife, sushi was excellent as was the wagyu beef tartare, and tuna tartare. Was disappointed with the desert menu though."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, was not impressed.   Salad was spring mix with Asian dressing, my fav dish, sadly. Dumplings were below par, filet was semi cold. My friends got the sea food choices (I'm allergic) and weren't impressed either. The staff was nice, but they forgot our entrées twice :(    I'm thinking they were having an off day, oh well. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to visit my son and daughter in law who now live in Charlotte. My son told me this was one of his favorite restaurants. He was right, this place was amazing! The service and the food was top notch. Everything was done to perfection. The restaurant was packed so I'm not the only person who thinks this way!"}
{"text":"I've heard/seen so many mixed reviews about this place I just had to give this place a try myself. Personally my husband and I had a great experience. The service was great and the food was pleasant. We had the calamari (which by far has been the best we've ever had), smoked salmon nigiri, soft shell crab roll and the 55 oz Australian tomahawk steak. We kinda knew what we wanted before hand which I think that is what made our service go pretty well. Our server had no problem with bringing our food out on time. There are a few things I didn't like which was the music (a little to loud), and the plain rice we ordered was really mushy and tasted like water the texture was horrible the kimchi was very salty as well. All in all this place is very nice and I do consider coming back soon"}
{"text":"Pricy but worth it. Presentation is good, staff are friendly, foods are delicious. Only criticism is too much vinegar for oyster, which is quite small, but the oyster is in good quality and watermelon fruity sauce is refreshing and tasty. Sea urchin is delicious, it's from Cali not Japan but still very good quality. Chef's choice sashimi is totally worth it! Will definitely visit again. Best of the day is WASABI is fresh made!!!! I really appreciate having the fresh wasabi! Most of the Japanese restaurants are using wasabi powder or mix with fresh. At here, only fresh made wasabi!!"}
{"text":"RESTAURANT WEEK RIP OFF: Poor service for our party of 6. Two people served salad then we waited, then one person got calamari, then we waited, then one person got sushi, and then we waited then another person got sushi and the sixth person got nothing...after a while waiter went down to kitchen to bring another salad. THEN, repeat style of service all 6 entrees brought at different time and waiter told us we were supposed to share!?  At the same time we had poor service, there were 7 loud very drunk men making so much noise you could not have any conversation at all. They were adults pouring sake into wine glasses, into beer and making impossible to hear anything. Waiter said he told management, but nothing changed. They finished their meal and continued to bar to drink and shout at the top of their voices. Oh and the portion size...miniscule. Does this restaurant think it will last in Charlotte!  We may be  very polite, but we do not take rip off's very well.   If you have a reservation here for restaurant week, Cancel it!"}
{"text":"Had reservation at 9pm, we were seated right away. It took the waiter about 8 minutes to greet us, which gave us a bad taste right away. Thankfully the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food, and was patient with our questions. Food was excellent!! We had five plates between the two of us and everything was delicious. No complaints at all, had a great experience, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good.  Something South Park, much less Charlotte, needed.  Good Asian food with nice presentation."}
{"text":"I've gone there twice in the last 2 months.   First, let me say that the food you get is masterfully prepared by the chef. The flavors and options are generally top notch. Presentation is huge, here, and I think that is a lot of what you pay for.   Our experience was marred by two unfortunate happenings:   1)  I got shot down 4 times when asking for drinks. Notably, on 2 different sakes that were on the menu or on display at the bar. This isn't a big huge deal, as I understand that they want to craft an experience... but I'm used to \"point and get\" at a restaurant.  2) There is a serious problem with their oyster supply system. Each time i have gone I've been served inedible oysters. The first time I ate four and one was horrifying, the second time I ate three and I had to spit out one, and another I swallowed but was not acceptable.  Also, the water tasted like crap (which I wonder about whether this is related to some of the other small problems).   All in all, it's outstanding food preparation that is crippled by fundamentals. There is a lot of potential in this restaurant if they can fix some of this stuff."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My wife and I started with a few appetizers and some sushi and loved every bite. We then ordered a couple of steaks, which were delicious! The only complaint was that my wife received her steak first and mine did not arrive until she was done, Over 20 minutes later! The staff tried to make up for it by giving us a free desert which was nice but to little to late. Overall it was a good meal and we will be back. But We will be hoping for better service."}
{"text":"Baku is named after a mythological dragon who eats bad dreams - my interest was immediately piqued after learning this.   I've been to Baku twice and never been disappointed by the cuisine or the breathtaking atmosphere. It's about time Charlotte gained an upscale establishment that isn't reeking of played out trends or beating that dead (and stuffy!) fine dining horse that should've been laid to rest years ago.  The Jidori Chicken breast was tender and savory, the mugi and miso soy glaze gives it a robust flavor that isn't overbearing or painfully salty as is the trend in some lesser establishments. The Day Boat Grouper Bites, Rock Shrimp Tempura and Tiger Prawns are tempura done perfectly - light and flaky, super fresh and unweighed down by excess greasiness or breading. I haven't had Red Miso soup since Nobu in NYC and was pleasantly surprised by Baku's take on Miso's not so common cousin. The Sweet Potato was also cooked perfectly - not stringy or undercooked, not drenched in sugar - and complimented our sushi (delicious yellowtail sashimi sliced thinly enough to melt in your mouth) amazingly well. However, my absolute favorite dish at Baku is the Giant Madagascar Prawn, hands down. I could eat a million of them and never get tired of them. Absolutely flawless.  The only thing I didn't love about Baku was the clearly condescending vibe given off by the Management. Guests seem to bug them and co-workers seem to bug them even more. A couple of people have commented on the posse of hosts that seem to be almost forcibly planted at the front door eager to open the door for you even when they're not busy at all which is, yeah... awkward. Add impersonal, nearly hawklike managers and you've got a slightly uninviting ushering in.  I haven't gotten the slightest clue what's up with that - Baku's food is heavenly, the atmosphere is killer, servers have always been efficient and helpful and hosts nothing but friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Great dinner experience at Baku. Our server Anthony was friendly, prompt and very informative. My favorite dish was the waygu tartare followed by the duck. The nigiri and dragon roll was also very good. I'd definitely suggest trying the pork belly skewers. The pork dumplings were the only item that didn't impress me. I love the decor and atmosphere.  It is on the pricey side considering the portions but you're paying for quality."}
{"text":"Very consistent Great food They always forget the surprise birthday desert This is the 3rd time they've done it l"}
{"text":"Freshest fish in Charlotte.  The tuna practically melts in your mouth, and the cod was unbelievable.  Great beer selection, and my colleagues approved of the saki.  Yes, it's pricey but it's also fresh, trendy, inventive, and fun.  Would be a great place to impress a date or host an expensive but swanky party.  Our large party utilized the upstairs private room, and we had a server who knocked our socks off by selecting a tantalizing collection of small plates based on our tastes.  Plenty of free parking available.  I'll be finding an excuse to come back soon."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Management needs some hospitality lessons. Came in at 4 for an early dinner while in the area shopping. Sat in the bar/lounge area upstairs. They were 'open' but still a lot of folks prepping and stuff. If you're gonna open at 4, be ready and set up then or open at 5 instead. Bartender upstairs was super nice and chatty, while he was drinking his coffee. He made some recommendations for me to have for dinner. See them below... While I was sitting there the bar manager (I'm assuming) was taking inventory, while they were 'open'. He was in the bar area for almost 30 minutes while I sat there and didn't even acknowledge my existence or try to make conversation, although he had no trouble joking and talking socially to the bartender...it was pretty sad that someone in a management position at a restaurant missed a chance to make a connection with a customer and make them feel welcome to the establishment instead of being cold. Almost felt like arrogance...anyways, I digress.  On to the food: Pork belly - too much sauce on the cubes but the kimchi and flavors were delish Tiger prawns - decent but just a little tough, maybe over cooked, sauce was good though Brussels sprouts - good Kumomoto oysters - always my fav of the oyster family, but the sauce totally destroyed the usually flavorful oysters (Since the pork belly wasn't 'all that' for me, the nice bartender took them off)  Bottom line, not impressed and I doubt I will revisit the restaurant anytime soon."}
{"text":"Once a month my girlfriends and I get together for a long overdue \"Girls' Night\"!! This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall.   Un-freaking-believable!!! There was something for everyone, I'm not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious!   Next, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms.   We were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme brûlée, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!!   From the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know I'll be back and I know we will also be back for more \"Girls' Nights\" in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Very expensive! Very little portions!  Oysters smaller than a quarter!  Only positive is the presentation is beautiful. Expect to leave broke and hungry!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty unique. Everything tastes good and the service is good as well. But they will make your pocket hurt. It's way too pricey for the amount of food they bring. Maybe I will come back someday, but I will check other places before."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music. I chose the scallops and the sweet corn. Very delicious! I will definitely come again to unwind after a busy day."}
{"text":"Umm.  This place.  I can't knock the good as was really quite good.  A bit over done on presentation which they certainly charge for.    The Izikaya style of restaurant is indeed small plates for sharing which I live.  Baku have joined Izikaya with fine dining. In my opinion this does not work.  Supposed to be inexpensive and pub type atmosphere which Baku is neither.   The waiters are well trained and well informed but this does not help the sell.  They don't help you organize the order very well.    Ok Ok.  In short. Great food, pretentious attitude and over the top setting.  May suit some but if I am going to pay for and wish to have fine dining. I will do just that, not try for the casual sharing experience of Izikaya in a pompous setting.   Good is great but will not return. Sorry.  Unless they lighten up.  Let me know.   Best.    SC."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I had that serves sushi. Unique and quite authentic sushi and sashimi. Well balanced flavor, gently done so you can still taste the fish. Fresh wasabi. Artistic presentation. Aromatic annd flavorful hot good. To top it off, excellent service and knowledgeable server/waitress. It was so good that I came here each night during my 2 day business travel. See the pictures and let your imagination roll. I recommend anyone to try if you have the budget."}
{"text":"I have to agree with David d. The taste, quality and price are completely misguided. 24 dollar rolls should make me dance around in delight, not think i should have gone to Cowfish.  And having loud drunk grown women at the bar screaming in a lounge atmosphere is in poor taste.....and so is having grown women so drunk that one vomitted on the top of the stairs last night. Gross!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and just ok food. Rock shrimp was good. We ordered the yellow tail, it cost $16 and there was 3 bite size pieces. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"The porkbelly is f*^#ing bonkers!  Everything was done so right and so fresh. Very impressive wine list as well. Definitely a great date night."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! We have been here many times and usually had great service. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of our recent visit. First, I called to verify my reservation 2 days before to make sure we would be sitting upstairs and they assured me we would. This was going to be my friends first time there, so I wanted them to experience the lounge upstairs. Well, when we arrived, they had a table downstairs for us. So, I kindly reminded the hostess of our reservation for upstairs and she told me there was no more tables up there but she would go check. Well, she came back and said there was a lounge table with some chairs, so we took it. I am not picky, and I love the atmosphere of the lounge area, so I didn't mind. Well, after sitting down and waiting awhile, the bartender came up and asked what we wanted to drink. When we asked questions about drinks, he didn't seem to know the answer and wasn't friendly about it. He barely talked to us-only to take our order. I get it, maybe he was having a bad night. But, to take it out on us, especially a repeat customer and 4 potential new ones-not smart for business! I never received one of my sushi rolls and told him about it but he still charged us for it and made it seem like we were lying. Now, I am sorry, but for as much money we spent, I sure as heck wasn't trying to get a free sushi roll!! I am not trying to knock this place down, but just wanted to share this incident because it was embarrassing to me, after telling my friends how great the place was and service has been and to have this happen was a big let down."}
{"text":"This place is a very trendy upscale Japanese restaurant. I did not realize that at first and showed up in flip flops and jeans. I definitely felt out of place.   It is very pricey but I really enjoyed the tuna maki roll, eggplant pot stickers and hot tea that I ordered.  The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of he prices and atmosphere. The sushi was great but not anything special, for the prices they are charging, it better be the best sushi ever.   The atmosphere was a little too pretentious for me, they had club music playing and it really seemed like a place that people went to just to look cool.  Overall, good food but the atmosphere was not at all what I wanted."}
{"text":"This was the best dinner had in Charlotte during our first long weekend there. Absolutely delicious.  Service so kind and professional, all dishes SO good and presented so well. Location is cool, when you get in you can smell the cedar wood, which I love, makes me think about mountain hotels. We tasted several dishes, from Uni sashimi to miso black cod glazed pork belly... (see pictures!) I look forward to go back. PS. dishes are not too big in general, so I suggest to order a few and taste (tapas style) but no more than 2 poeple for each dish or there will not be enough :)"}
{"text":"They are open for brunch now in Sundays!!! Open at 11am - 3pm!! The brunch is amazing!!! Price is right at $36 per person and $14 for 12 and under. Amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Yeeeaaaa I mean it's aight. Came here for Restaurant week with my peoples and the ambience is nice. Our waiter attempted to be funny with his little light jokes. They weren't really landing, but I appreciate the friendly attitude. Five star attitude, but the food was 3 stars.   The Brussels sprouts were hittin it. They taste just like the sprouts at Futo Buta. I don't know who ripped who off and I don't care, because truthfully that was the highlight of my meal.   The dumplings were aight. Something was off to me. Like the spices didn't meld well for me.   The salmon was actually pretty good with the side salad and sweet potatoes. The salmon was cooked medium and really fresh. I'm glad they serve Wild Caught because I don't do farm raised. The potatoes were soft and seasoned well. I liked the slice of lemon which I sprayed all over my dish.   Now unfortunately the portions were so small I had to order what was supposed to be a chocolate cake. The waiter recommended this and I was like \"Bet\" I'm bout to top my night off with something sweet and this will make up for the small toddler food portions of food I just got.   {Sigh} I think I got duped because my friggin cake tasted like one of those Little Debbie cakes. I paid $5 and could have purchased a box of cakes for the same flavor.   I never heard too much about this place but in my opinion it's overrated for the prices.   ... on to the next spot..."}
{"text":"Ended up at Baku Thursday night after the wait at Cowfish was more than 30 minutes at 8:00pm. I called Baku and they said they could get us right in. I've been here before twice but both were for restaurant week. I really enjoyed trying their regular menu, and our waiter was really helpful! They had a special that night of Bluefin tuna served 3 ways from fattiest to least fatty. I would come back just to eat platefuls of that and the salmon belly. Holy God it was good. It should melt in your mouth, which it did, quickly. It was gone in a matter of minutes. We also had the rock shrimp tempura and one of the sushi rolls. Both excellent. My only complaint was that the pork belly was overcooked and the fire alarm went off due to poor ventilation, but all in all, excellent experience!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have such a hard time paying a hefty price for Asian food...I don't care how it's packaged...even if it's in a kettle hot pot. That said, however, this is a great new addition to SouthPark. Solid 3 stars and A-OK in my book.  Old world Asia meets modern New South. It's well polished and upscale sporting modern decor and loud \"clubby\" music while the menu boasts of old Asian traditions...didn't quite feel congruent, but I guess it works. In any case, the food was very good and very pricey. If you really want to impress someone or a client, this place is surely on par. Order many rounds of small plates and 3 or 4 will make any diner happy and leave with a full Buddha belly.  Valet and servers are friendly and eager to serve. Valet is in the front and regular parking is in the back or the parking garage/deck at the building next door.  Like I mentioned, great new restaurant, but not one that I'll become a regular. With those prices and atmosphere, I really have to be dolled up and have money to burn."}
{"text":"I have to say that the flavors of the food were excellent. However, the amount of food that you get for the price you pay is ridiculously under expectation. Example: Ice Bowls for \"2\" is $20.00. This means that each person at your party of \"2\" get 1 piece of sushi, for $20.00. I found it to be ridiculously over priced for what we received. Dessert Bowl: $40.00 for what appeared to be Sara Lee desserts and 3 scoop of ice creams. The atmosphere was good and the A/C was broken or off (90 that night), service was very slow. This was not the servers fault, understaffed was the issue. Again the flavors are excellent atmosphere was good. However for me to return they are going to need a major improvement on the A/C and upgrade the portion size. Total price or our meal with 20% gratuity was over $400.00 for a party of 4. This was with moderate items ordered."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! Recommend the uni spoon and tuna tartar! Also the sashimi is so fresh! Worth of your money!"}
{"text":"Baku was recommended to us by a bartender at one of our favorite restaurants. There was a high expectation before we even got there... I'm sure you know where I am going with this. The ambience was nothing special, reminded me of the inside of a Pier 1. The service was good, I can't take that away from them, but very robotic.  Every server had a long spiel about the menu, our server actually walked us through the whole menu. We can actually read and naming almost every dish was misleading- he should have only highlighted the best or best selling. The cocktails were nice, Pimm's cup and Cuba Libre.  As the food starting coming out family style things started to go pear shaped. Chicken livers, no, don't do it. Pork dumplings, good, but basic. The sushi was the highlight. We had a signature eel roll with sweet potatoes (off of the specials list). And a salmon belly nigiri with some sort of glaze. Honestly I wish I could name them but I was so distracted by the amount of food that we ordered and did not enjoy. Corn on the cob, was too charred on the grill for my liking. The robata duck with melon was good, and a generous portion. Butterfish sashimi was another fail for us.  Did I mention the fruit flies that swarmed around us the entire time?  When I got the check it was insult to injury. $$$ should be more like $$$$. I was still hungry!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing.....you don't even realize you are in Charlotte. The food is just ok I left a bit hungry. It is definitely overpriced. \"The drunken whale\" sake was good. I would definitely go here for a cocktail or 2 but that's about it"}
{"text":"I had the most glorious dinner here with my family this week. We ordered a lot of different dishes and every one was delicious. The server was very attentive to my gluten allergy. Nice ambiance inside. Probably the best food I've had in this area of the country. Cod was EXCELLENT. King crab nigiri and butter fish nigiri were our favorites."}
{"text":"Yum! Bartender was attentive and all the food ordered was very delicious. I would highly recommend this place for some great sushi (especially the roll with the wagyu beef on top)."}
{"text":"Didn't think you have to get reservation to eat sushi or eat at normal table! When it wasn't even busy nor it was no info on website that you have reservations to eat a normal table. Service was okay, sushi is about average! Nothing to scream about, pricey for what you pay for! I think twice before I go there or maybe not!"}
{"text":"Okay so I know I reviewed this place before and raved about the food, service, etc. But we went back for our anniversary last weekend. Let me say that Baku is probably one of my favorite expensive night out places (and to be honest we thought it was going to be more expensive than it was).   Service was phenomenal!! The hostesses wished us a happy anniversary, our waiter was awesome and surprisingly the same one we had on our first visit, and the management was so thoughtful in giving us a dessert platter on the house for our anniversary. Seriously they were truly amazing and made our evening :)  The food well, we had a combination of things we had tried before and things we didn't try before. The pork belly was to die for!! Seriously I'll never skip that one again lol. Also another new dish we tried was the Hamachi rice crispie treat which was also delicious!! We ordered probably around 8 dishes to share and we were beyond stuffed (needed a doggy bag). However obviously we didn't pass on dessert!!   The cocktails were just as amazing as we remembered... the pear one and the oriental apple are my two favs!! I know a lot of people complain about price versus portions and I can see where they are coming from however we find it completely worth it!! The quality speaks for itself.  Only ehhh item we got was the sweet corn. It was on the cob mini style and it came out cold and had too much oil. It wasn't bad  but we wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This place needs a new manager.   They took us to upstairs when downstairs was pretty empty, which is weird but fine. Upstairs was pretty empty too, only 4 people were using dinner when we got there. Then when we started our entree, there are a 4-people party came, and they were seated right next to us, REALLY?! There are so many other tables out there and they have to seat them right next to us?   When we finished entree, one of our appetizer didn't come, we reminded waitress she told us it would come soon. 10 mins later, we were still waiting and have to listen to our loud neighbor's table(to be fair they are not that loud but 4 people talking right next to you, and you can clearly hear their conversation). So we told waitress we are leaving, we don't want to wait for the dish they forgot to cook. No apologizes from the restaurant.  Waitress said she took the dish off the bill and she made it sound she did us a favor."}
{"text":"The best sushi and bar in the City!  I love going with friends and my husband any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, waiter  and presentation were fantastic. The miso soup was so bland that it was more like dish water with mushrooms.  Had a lobster roll, toro and soft shell crab roll.  All lack any flavor other than the bitter taste of raw asparagus.  Not what it used to be and definitely not worth the $60.00 per person price tag. Too bad as I remember it being really good two years ago."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte, and came into Baku with only these reviews on yelp to guide me.  I am here to tell you that this is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to.  From the moment I walked in and was greeted, to when I sat at the bar and was immedately served by Joey the bartender, I was treated like a VIP.  The Yellowfin Tuna roll was made custom with an added ingredients with no issues.  The Sazerac was made with expertise.  But the pork belly skewers stole the show.  They were legit, and were highly recommended by Joey.  I will definately be back with a date."}
{"text":"There is not much I enjoyed about this restaurant. I will start with what I did like. The patio, it had a lot of shade, great atmosphere and comfortable seating. With that being said we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by our server. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were not informed that we had been seated out there, even still quite a few other servers walked by a few times and they didn't even notice or offer to get someone for us. The sushi we ordered was not good at all. Especially for how expensive it was. If you like traditional sushi this is not the restaurant for you.  The saki was good but again, over priced."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place.  Great quality good, but fairly small portions. They have valet parking if needed.   My favorite dishes are the scallop skewers, calamari app, and the sushi rolls. The pork belly app is also very delicious if seafood is not your style. Not the best to come here starving or your bill will be quite large.   Tip: if you are looking for a quieter dining experience I recommend requesting to seat downstairs, especially on the weekends. If you enjoy a more lively experience sit upstairs where the bar is at. Also a tv or two up there. On the weekends the music is turned up and it is very energetic, but may be too loud for some. They also have a small patio area out front."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who likes sushi to this restaurant. Made a reservation on OpenTable and when we arrived the restaurant was virtually empty and they asked if we wanted to be seated upstairs for some reason. We ask to be seated downstairs  and throughout the meal the restaurant was still virtually empty .  I ordered the salmon and the brussel sprouts. The salmon entree arrived and half of it was raw. The brussel sprouts were the leafs of the sprouts and very few solid pieces of Brussel sprouts. This was a side dish for $9  My friend enjoyed her sushi. Menus left on the table for our entire meal and had to ask twice to have water glasses refilled.  The wine was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome. I'm generally a tough critic but this place has blown me away. The service has been great and the food has been even better. I would recommend this Asian fusion to anyone!!! This place focuses on experience, which is sooooo appreciated.   Anthony is the best waiter in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant! I had the dragon roll while my husband had their famous baby rack ribs and once again Baku amazed us! We were treated so nicely and the owner took the time to explain the menu and enhance our experience. We're bringing our friends next weekend for our double date and we're sure they'll be impressed. Can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant I've been to in Charlotte. In fact, it might be the best restaurant I've ever been to. It has great aesthetics, great music, phenomenal drinks, and incredible food. The service is on point and all servers are very knowledgable about the menu. I've never been disappointed by this place. Do yourself a favor and take your next date to Baku. (Just don't forget your wallet!)"}
{"text":"Baku is unique, the decor, the presentation, service, and who cares about all that if the food isn't dazzling, it's very expensive, but it's worth the price, my hat is off for the Chefs and their crew.  If your wallet has some weight to shed pay a visit, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Every dish is like a work of Art. Wonderful atmosphere, excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Worst place in town.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  My family and I made reservations for my birthday.  It was our first time trying out the place.  Our reservation was for 7:45 pm.  We arrived on time and was told by the host our table would be ready shortly.  We moved to the side and waited.  We waited five minutes... ten minutes... fifteen minutes... twenty minutes... twenty-five minutes... thirty minutes.  Still did not get our so-called reserved seat.    Meanwhile, other guests who walked in the door with no reservations got sat almost immediately.  What's the point of making a reservation at this establishment?  They will take reservations but they will not honor them.  We complained to the manager, who didn't apologize or made any attempts at trying to reconcile the situation.  The blonde female host is completely unprofessional and rude.  They all need a course in How-To-Be-A-Civil-Person 101.  We left. We don't plan on going there ever again.  F*** you, Baku.  P.S.  We also witnessed one of the line cooks literally blowing on the food he was cooking, while it was on the grill - spit and everything.  It must be the secret ingredient."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant in Charlotte. Yes it's expensive. Yes the portion sizes are small and you need to order a good amount of food to feel full but that's what a fine dining restaurant is like (which Charlotte is not too familiar with). The food is amazing especially their wagyu beef and Nigiri. However, their dessert chocolate cake tasted like the instant Betty Crocker stuff. I will still let that slide as the appetizers and main course and the service were exceptional. Also loved the contemporary feel. If this restaurant closes there really will be no options in this city next time I want a fancy night out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service and a very cool atmosphere.  I will say that it is VERY pricey.  For a full meal with wine/drinks, starters, etc I would say this is just as expensive as The Palm, Capital Grill, etc...  It's definitely with trying and if on a budget just  look for more reasonably priced small pates and rolls."}
{"text":"I went to Baku to celebrate my son's birthday.  It was fantastic, a true foodie restaurant.  I read the reviews and had a rough idea of what I wanted to order but it was restaurant week and decided to order off that menu.  I saw another reviewer mention John W. we got him too and he expertly helped select the courses.  Calamari was perfect, Hamachi role very good.  We added the pork belly because of the rave reviews; it was great too.   Great atmosphere, great food, expensive but you'll be glad you treated yourself and guests.  I'll be back for sure and looking for John W. again."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday dinner and was very interested in trying Baku. I have read several reviews and seen plenty of pictures of this restaurant especially when it first opened but it seemed like the hype died down recently.  I made reservations last minute in fear it might be busy on a Friday evening but I had no trouble making reservations on the way to the restaurant. When we arrived I realized I probably did not even need the reservations, there was not a wait and not many people in the restaurant We were immediately taken upstairs to the a dining area. I did like the decor and lounge feel of the restaurant.  Our waiter was very prompt and helpful. Unfortunately he told us that they are in the process of changing the menu so a lot of the menu items are no longer available, ie a lot of the items I saw on Yelp. Because the menu is tapas style we just started ordering everything that sounded good to us.  Pork wontons: these were ok, they were good size and plenty to share among the 3 of us. Brussels sprouts: my favorite item, they were crispy but also a little sweet with a sweet soy sauce drizzled. Pork Belly: good size pork belly but not cooked crispy enough for me, a little too fatty. Dragon Roll: I enjoyed the dragon roll, because my mom is allergic to avocado we had to sub for extra eel which caused them to up-charge us but we all still enjoyed the roll Sea Bass: My dad ordered the sea bass and I did not try it but he said it was ok but which it was cook a little crispier.  Beignets: beignets were not the normal beignets but there were a nice dessert to share after dinner. The ice cream that is on top tasted more of a whipped frosting or something more than ice cream.   Overall Baku is a nice restaurant and the atmosphere makes it a nice place for a low key dinner. I would be interested in seeing the new menu."}
{"text":"We came here for Charlotte restaurant week last night. We ordered the edamame and Brussels sprouts, both were very good. Next course we got the maki and the calamari. The sushi was awesome but they only give you 4 tiny pieces!  And finally our main courses were served, salmon and steak for my husband. We just hope that's their restaurant week size portion because we would NEVER pay their full price menu price for those cuts of meat!! Would like to go back and try sushi next time!"}
{"text":"Don't bother! Pretentious, over rated, and boring. Just keep driving or go back home and make Ramen Noodles."}
{"text":"Went again last night.  Another awesome night.  This time we had the pork dumplings, Alaskan king crab, tenderloin with asparagus skewers, salmon nigiri and calamari.  Washed it down with the unfiltered Belvedere martini with a few extra olives... this place is my favorite place in Charlotte.  Everything is excellent.  Food, décor, service... just go here and eat something already."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my mother's birthday, and well we had to do it pretty big. There's some things you just have to get here, and it should be required. I think if you're going to spend money on sushi and normal items that you can get anywhere else...you can, but just know there are a lot of other things on the menu that you're missing out. Let's just say I didn't do much ordering, as my brother mostly had that on lock since he knew what was good and wasn't.  What did we eat... Good question. Let's just say it was an assortment of food and the quality were all great. I'll go through each photo, but to be honest, the otoro is what you should look at getting (the picture that's on the ice). I think that dish is amazing especially just the experience of it. There are all these other options as well, but to me that one stood out.   The restaurant is a little dark, but it's going for the lounge/romantic setting which I understand. We sat upstairs next to the bar and it was pretty comfortable. If you're looking for a good solid sushi/japanese restaurant and it's for a special occasion, I would definitely suggest that Baku would be on that list."}
{"text":"John W, our server, was absolutely phenomenal. Since the menu was slightly intimidating, John took his time to walk us through the menu, hinting at what we may or may not enjoy according to our unique palates.   We started the night with a decadent cucumber mint martini which was refreshing after just milling about South Park Mall. The Martini was followed up by the crispy calamari. This calamari was paired with a chipotle mayo sauce and a grilled lemon. The kick of lemons acidic juices added an extra layer of flavor atop the delicately fried, perfectly seasoned, squid pieces. I cannot rave enough about the calamari served here. I find that calamari, if not quality squid, is chewy and rubbery. However, at Baku this was not the case-- the calamari was buttery and smooth, it melted in my mouth.    Next up: the seasonal tempura vegetables. Unlike most tempura, the chefs only fried a thin crust around the various veggies, which complemented the vegetables flavors instead of overpowering them. This dish, akin to the calamari was served with a grilled lemon but instead of a mayo based sauce, it was a miso-soy-herb medley. Absolutely stunning.   We continued onto one of the salads, the roasted eggplant and tomato to be exact. This dish was another piece of art. The dish was a mountain of Japanese eggplant cut into small ovals and roasted to perfection. The seedy consistency of the eggplant was paired with crisp heirloom tomatoes that waited at the bottom of the eggplant mountain, acting as sort of a foundation for the plate. I decided to cross-contaminate here and dipped the eggplants into the miso-herb sauce that came with the vegetable tempura.   Lastly was our sushi-- and boy was it worth the wait. We had an order of Gokujo Tuna and Forbidden. Both were presented beautifully. Forbidden was wrapped with black rice, a nice change of pace from the normal sticky sushi rice. The black rice added an extra crunch to the roll. The gokujo tuna roll had a wonderful underlying heat that amped the flavors up a bit. This heat is reminiscent of a wasabi type heat-- one that comes through your nose and mouth then tapers off slowly. Paired with this heat was the yuzu sauce, a citrusy sauce that truly pulls the plate together.   Overall, Baku was phenomenal. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences we've had in Charlotte. We were never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, and the entrees came out almost 15 minutes apart. Mine was getting cold so I had to eat it, and my wife's didn't arrive until I was almost done. Will not be coming back here. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Baku has great decor and ambiance. Upstairs has a bar and a casual atmosphere. Downstairs is a little more formal. We sat upstairs.   Let's first talk about the service. The wait staff is well trained. They really explain the dishes well and try to sell them to you. The usual stuff like..'oh great selection.. So jealous you are eating it' etc. I liked the service since they try pretty hard.  They have a fair amount of veg dishes which is good since I am vegetarian. The forbidden rice sushi looked amazing and tasted better than any other veg  wrapped sushi I have ever had. The tempura veg was ordinary. The mushroom rice pot was presented and sold to me by the waiter and it tasted quite good. Like a Japanese risotto. The Brussels sprouts were awful!   I was expecting the place to blow my mind based on the menu prices. It didn't . It would have gotten five stars if the food lived up to the price. My significant other ordered meat dishes, she was not that impressed either."}
{"text":"I was shocked - SHOCKED - to see butterfish on their menu. I asked our server about it and I said \"is that the fish that gives you intestinal issues\"? She said \"oh no, our chef is world class and he wouldn't have something like that on our menu. Butterfish is escolar.\" I responded \"YES! Escolar is the fish that causes explosive diarrhea!\" I then Googled it on my iphone and sure enough I was correct. Why on Earth would they put this on their menu I do not know.   I thought the restaurant was beautifully decorated and very warm and inviting. The service was somewhat knowledgeable and very attentive. However they did the thing that I hate the most and scream \"corporate concept\" - our server asked if we'd like sparkling or still water and when he asked for still she asked if we'd like Fugi or \"Charlotte's Finest\". It's a terrible attempt at upselling.   We had the pork belly skewers, blue fin tuna maki roll, king crab leg & salmon roll, tempura veggies, tenderloin and asparagus skewers, pork dumplings, tofu, edamame, etc. We had a wide range of dishes and overall they were all just good, but not exceptional and certainly not memorable. Especially not so for the price.   I'm still shocked that they have escolar on their menu. For that reason, and the lack of a wow factor, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"The theme of this place is cool, the restaurant is kind of sexy, the service is excellent, and the presentation of the food is unique and fun. The food itself though is pretty standard, so it feels bad to have to pay so much for it. This is a one time place for me, I don't regret it, I enjoyed it but I can similar quality food elsewhere for cheaper. Boom."}
{"text":"Great spot in Charlotte!! I live in LA but am in Charlotte about 3 times per year and this is the best thing you guys have going!! I have had robata at Katana on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and at Wolgang Puck's Robata restaurant in Vegas but this place tops them both! Very delicious and creative menu!! I will make Baku a regular stop when I come back to town!"}
{"text":"We have been to Baku twice and both times have been blown away. This is the BEST sushi in Charlotte - hands down!  The quality of the fish is unreal, but the creativity takes it up multiple notches. This is now our favorite date night spot. The salmon belly sashimi has such amazing flavor that we start and END with it. I want the flavors to linger in my mouth and mind until we get to visit again. Sit at the sushi bar, the chefs are great and will help customize dishes. I'm allergic to shellfish and my husband isn't so they customized a roll to have half with and half without. No other sushi restaurant has ever done that. Can't wait until our next visit."}
{"text":"I want to start my review by saying that their reservation system is the worst. The reason I say that is because you will never see the time slot of 7-8:30 available to book a spot. I reserved a table for four at 6:30 and saw many empty tables while we dining until when we were leaving around 8:30. Now, the food: it is a very small limited menu so not sure what the hype is about. The dragon roll was my favorite and lychee martini was delicious. It is an overpriced place that lacks service (second round of drinks took forever to come) and variety in menu. I would likely not return here, we paid 200 some dollars for four people and  still left hungry and unsatisfied food wise specifically"}
{"text":"Yum!  Date night heaven.  My husband and I came here a couple weeks back and it was delicious!  We ordered several dishes, mostly from the special menu but everything was tasty.  The sushi was super fresh but in my opinion over priced. The dumpling were tasty!  The sake was really good but overpriced.  The mark up was too much for what I know wasn't an expensive bottle.  The butterfish was very tasty as well and I would order it again.  Everything was pretty good but overpriced to me... Coming from New York I think that says something.  I don't want to take away from the food because it was good but not super special to explain the prices.  Perhaps we were paying for the atmosphere which was very nice.  Our server was nice but didn't offer any suggestions which wasn't super helpful but that was okay because everything was tasty.  We will come again when we want to spend a lot on some decent sushi"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, lots of variety on the menu, but pretty pricey.   It's a tapas place so things come out of the kitchen at different times regardless of when you order.   A few items everyone should order: the pork belly just melts in your mouth, asparagus nice presentation tastes even better than it looks, sweet corn definitely for sharing, black cod small portion but super delicious, chicken meatballs sauces are so tasty."}
{"text":"Placing 1-3 stars 3 being most liked by our group. Ordered the **Ribs, ***Soft shell crab roll, ***uni shooters, **sashimi plate, ***pork belly, *tomahawk steak, *dumplings, and *Brussel sprouts. Uni shooters with quail and truffle were my favorite. The pork belly came in next and was very juicy and tender. Raw scallop was perfect on the sushi plate, just wish there was more. The ribs were a bit too salty and the Brussels sprouts were too oily (even asked for them with out oil after seeing them on someone else's table). The tomahawk steak wasn't a great value and didn't compare to the others I've ordered around. It's our 3rd or 4th time coming here, we will be back but will try other items!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing - great option if you are looking for inventive, interesting Japanese options.  We went there on a random weeknight after doing some shopping. Located in an older building across from the South Park mall, the overall impression inside is intimate and sophisticated. Great for a date night or going out with friends after work.  We order a cross section of small plates, including sushi as well as their specialty, grilled meats. Everything was spectacular, from the delicately assembled sushi (including an incredible butterfish with a citrus glaze) to the high-heat grilled items, in particular the scallops and the beef tenderloin. On a related note, if you are a chicken liver fan, you must get their skewered livers, probably the best I've ever had! The ingredients are all top-notch and the subtle flavor combinations are genuinely unique.   Service was very good - intelligent, well-timed and not pushy.  This place belongs on your top-5 Charlotte list!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Love the creativity and different menu. Love it but find it a bit pricey and too dark inside."}
{"text":"Great service, flavorful food.  Perf for groups that are looking to share lots of small plates and have an experience trying interesting foods.  Always get the crispy rice with spicy tuna on top, and the tuna tartare with taro root chips hit da spot.  The king crab legs make you feel like a Kween and the pork dumplings are everything u want in a dumpling.  Love yourself and come here with cash to blow, fun people and a free spirit.  While you're having a good time with ur crew, food will be poppin up at your table as its ready.  Once one dish is chowed down, the next one is on the way.  Keep dat lineup rollin"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who isn't completely wowed by Baku! Phew.  The fella and I visited on a Wednesday night after making Open Table reservations, and we parked in the back to avoid the valet.  Upon entering, literally seven Baku staff members were lined up to the right of the door to... welcome us?  Bizarre.  We headed upstairs to have a drink since the downstairs bar was already a little crowded.  Our bartender was nice, but fully admitted she was having an off night after making the wrong drink then spilling the right drink.  Oy.  The decor is really cool - dark walls, orange fans on the ceiling, painted eyes on the wall staring at you - the staff are all very chic and sleek.  It definitely has a clubby vibe.  Onto the food!  After our drink, we were seated upstairs. Our waiter was awesome - he was so gracious and helpful and didn't even make fun of me when I had to ask for a fork (chopsticks aren't my forte).  The fella and I got a bottle of wine and ordered three of the small plates/appetizers so that we could try a little bit of everything.    * The pork belly skewers were good, but there wasn't a ton of flavor, and they were TINY.  We got two skewers with two tiny pieces on each. * The rock shrimp tempura tasted very fresh and light, and since there were six pieces, I got to take a few more bites than of the pork belly. * Lastly, we ordered the beef and asparagus skewers, which were good, but nothing to write home about.  There were three tiny pieces of beef and one piece of asparagus.  Two drinks at the bar cost $11 and $12 + tip.  Dinner was a $50 bottle of wine and those three small plates cost more than $60... then we added tip.  The moral of the story is that Baku thinks A LOT of their tiny portions, and I had to eat a real dinner when I got home.  Cool, hip ambiance and excellent service, but I just can't justify the price for what you get."}
{"text":"Definitely get the ice box and the ootoro (fatty tuna) tartare if you are here for sashimi experience. The ice box will allow you to sample a whole range of seafood, including, but not limited to, tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, mackerel, octopus, scallops, etc.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice wasn't too spicy, but it definitely had that delayed heat at the end.  The amazing service and the loungey type of seats upstairs made this whole food experience even better."}
{"text":"I decided to write a review since they seem to be so mixed on here- and I almost didn't want to come thinking I would be disappointed. We started out at the upstairs bar with a couple Nigori Blue Martinis- Belvedere unfiltered vodka dirty martinis, so good we never even switched to wine during the meal, we just kept these comin'. Only $11- good deal. We sat downstairs at a booth, our server was awesome, all the staff seemed very polite.   Now- the food. We ordered a variety and shared everything. Favorite thing hands down was the tuna tartare with what I think were taro root chips- this stuff was heaven in your mouth. Other plates that really stood out were the salmon belly nigiri, rock shrimp tempura, and the yellowtail roll with serrano peppers, cucumber and avocado. Crispy calmari with serrano peppers was good too. We also tried the wagyu beef tataki, gokujo tuna roll, lobster & avocado roll, and of course we had to get the giant Madagascar prawn. Everything was delicious!! All of the presentation was beautiful and the plates rolled out a few at a time so we had a chance to really enjoy them. Decor is really cool, great vibe and relaxing & inviting atmosphere. Extensive sake list, will have to explore more next time. It was a great dining experience- I can't wait to try their brunch. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"When in Charlotte for work, a few colleagues and I decided to continue our nights of dinner sushi at Baku.  I am so glad that we did!   We ordered a bunch of sushi, apps/tapas and one of the dinners and just shared everything.  Absolutely everything was awesome and that includes the service as well.   Everything about our experience here was phenomenal - if I'm ever in Charlotte again , I will indeed be back."}
{"text":"We finally ate here. We had a reservation and it was a beautiful night, so walking in as I realized they have a patio, I hoped to sit there. We were told there was a wait and my husband was hungry so we got seated inside immediately.   I was told wine pours were small, so we both opted for a cocktail. My husband got a gin & cucumber concoction which he thought was kind of like lemonade. I got a wild tea vodka & cucumber drink. It was a little sweeter than I prefer but glad I tried it!  Now to the menu . . . our waitress, Morgan, was very thorough in explaining the style of the restaurant. She suggested an item from each page, but that seemed like a lot. But I guess in the end we probably ordered that much!   We started with the calamari which was delicious! Lightly crispy and delicate! We decided on two sushi rolls. Spicy tuna - yum! - and Forbidden Rice roll which had white asparagus. It was unique and tasty! For our next round, I asked about the baby artichoke skewers which Morgan highly recommended, as well as the rice bowls. My husband wasn't up for either, so we focused on entrees. We ordered Grilled Branzini b/c we'd never had it. It was 2 small slices of grilled fish (not much flavor!!) and a tomato salad. Very small portion and disappointing flavor for $24!! Since our waitress asked about it, my husband told her it was just ok and didn't have a lot of flavor. When she brought the bill, she informed us she took the Branzini off the tab! We greatly appreciated that!  All in all, it was good but not a great experience and not worth the $65 (total without the entree). I'd go back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant in several ways: Food, taste and presentation are impeccable-- Atmosphere, fun, inventive and inviting-- Service, warm but professional.  6 of us ate here last night and did all 'tapas style' dishes.  Every dish was truly exceptional, imaginative and absolutely delicious!  We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"A second review for one place? Still amazing. They've recently opened for brunch, and I absolutely had to stop in and try what they had working up. Here's my thoughts!  \"Viking-style Brunch\"   Fruit box - a variety of seasonal fruits served on bed of ice. Great to nibble on while waiting on my other guests to arrive. Enjoyed very fresh squeezed orange juice.   Liege Waffles - absolutely amazing. Lightly crisped waffles served with this great spread selection. Chocolate ginger and white chocolate mousse. We mixed them together. Incredible.   Sous Vide Eggs - sweet potato hash compliments the duck pastrami and egg that's cooked to a nice creamy perfection. All of this is drizzled with a yuzu hollandaise.. Making a very eclectic spin on the traditional brunch eggs Benedict.   There is a sushi cart offered with a widespread variety of rolls, sashimi and nigiris. We nibbled lightly on this .. Wanting to fill up on the brunchy goodness.   You're then offered a salad for the table... And we each got to select an entree. I chose the spicy filet... Always a favorite. My guests chose the jiodori chicken and the salmon teriyaki. We also devoured their wild mushroom kamamashi pot. Great warm ending to the meal. Especially for a rainy brunch Sunday.   I definitely recommend pairing your brunch with bubbles. We paired our waffles and eggs with the Moët Rose, but they offer a great list of bubbles and cocktails to start your Sunday off right.   Overall, Baku impresses again. For $36 a guest...to eat such an impressive array... Definitely a go-to brunch spot for something delicious that's a fresh change of pace."}
{"text":"Food was good but EXTREMELY small portions. Way too $$ for food. Paid $17 for 2, yes 2 scallops. No sides.  Glad we tried in once. Many other fancy places in Southpark that feed us more!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our experience. If you are looking for an overpriced meal with poor service then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Baku isn't bad. You pay for the ambiance for sure. I loved it inside, made for a great date night.  There isn't a big parking lot so that's a con. We went for an early dinner and found a spot easily. I'd suggest that. Our service was great, and our food was great. Not too much more you could ask for."}
{"text":"Intimate setting and a killer cocktail bar. Monday nights they offer 1/2 price bottles of wine. The selections I always gravitate towards are the Baku Yellowtail and Roasted Hamachi. This is a great spot for date night."}
{"text":"Amazing selection. Three words. Salmon Belly Nigiri. I travel for business and have had sushi in some of the best restaurants in LA, Vegas, NYC and more, and this might be the best tasting Nigiri I have ever had."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte. Chef Mark is the best! You must try this restaurant if you are a sushi lover!!"}
{"text":"Baku is great. The spicy yellow tail was  amazing . Environment was tasty and intimate, great date spot. Would recommend and also come back."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every penny. Our waitress was super knowledgeable and guided us well throughout our ordering. My husband and I enjoyed the whole experience and left satiated and satisfied. We were underwhelmed with the sushi roll we ordered - don't come here for amazing sushi. Come here to try out menu items you can't eat anywhere else. If it looks quirky, order it."}
{"text":"I can't get behind Baku.  It's not the portion size or the price but rather the quality and the taste quotient.    I'm a serious sushi guy and this places misses the mark.    I found the sashimi was either too cold or certainly not melt-in-the-mouth fresh.  The assortment was so plain I could have found more eclecticism in a grocery store and the slices were strangely extremely thick cuts, not at all expertly done.  Served on a giant block of ice this was boorish sushi 101.    They claimed to have fresh wasabi, but apparently don't know what this means as it was the powdery fake stuff.  I even asked the server and they thought it was fresh.  I didn't bemoan it in person because I didn't want to be *that guy* but the servers should at least be educated on the cuisine.  The Baku salad is the best thing to order here as the greens are fresh and the dressing light and sweet.   The edamame was disappointing and had a freeze-dried texture to it--eew!  As I'm a glutton for punishment I tried the miso-glazed black cod.  Even though I had pointed out to my server that I wanted to do a healthy meal, he didn't mention their miso cod is basically butter cod!!  I almost forgot the kumamoto oysters which were one step away from being off and garishly presented with giant watermelon bubbles which looked like some sort of sick growth."}
{"text":"Tried this place out the 2nd week it opened, and I must say, it was a phenomenal experience.  When walking in, you feel like you are in Tokyo/NYC/South Beach/Hollywood all at the same time.  Great ambiance and music.  It was quite busy that night.  I must also add that we had over 10 people in our party, so it was rather challening for our waiter.  I'll have to go try it again, to see if they improved on their service but other than that,  the food was excellent.  The dessert  was incredible!  It was a giant mountain (literally looked like a mountain) of ice cream gelato, cake, fruit and several other things.  Absolutely delicious!  What a great addition to SouthPark and to Charlotte in general!  So glad to see something more unique in this area instead of the usual Steakhouses and franchise crap."}
{"text":"Very trendy and sophisticated restaurant in the heart of Southpark.  I went here for a large birthday dinner with friends. It's located right across the street from Southpark Mall next door to the \"ski slope\" church.  I will preface this review with the fact that I'm not really into sushi.  My table ordered a special sushi dinner that was multiple courses and was not on the menu.  I didn't try many of the dishes. I will write about what I did try and rate it accordingly.  I ordered the skirt steak based on others reviews on Yelp. Thanks yelpers! It was fantastic! So juicy and tender. I'd go back just for the skirt steak.  The high light of the night was the Wagyu meat! It was amazing.  For $25/oz it better be though. It literally melts in your mouth it is so fantastic.  It was a special treat for the birthday party celebration. Not something I would order myself because of the high price tag.  Every plate that came out was presented beautifully and you could tell the chefs had taken a lot of time to display the food.  I had a great time with my friends but I don't know if I will be back here because of the steep price tag. Maybe I will check them out during restaurant week.   They do have a large bar upstairs and valet parking out front."}
{"text":"This is a very pretentious dump, designed to impress the socialites who neither value money or service. Apparently \"Baku\" is Japanese for tiny little portions that we charge way too much for. There were a total of four tables sitting yet we had to constantly wait for service... I had to get up at one point to wave down our server to get another $22 drink. The only positive is that what little food we got was actually pretty good, and the servers were all friendly."}
{"text":"This was my initial visit to this place and I found it wanting.   If you don't drink like my wife and I there is really not much on the menu for you.  When we went there was a total of 4 pages of food on them menu this was a whole book.   The food left us looking for something to balance out the salt and our water was not doing much.   The plates of food were small and the food to price value is low.  The food was fair to good at best.  I have had better for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a round of cocktails and some dessert.  They were pretty busy so service seemed a little confused and slow.  Drinks were fine and the desserts were pretty good.  Our server even gave us an extra dessert because he felt that things were taking a while.  Thought it was a nice gesture.  Overall, 3 stars for our brief visit with them.  Nothing impressed me, but I had no real concerns either."}
{"text":"Baku was our ABSOLUTE FAVORITE when the restaurant first opened years ago. I was OBSESSED and bragged to my whole network about it. I mean, I was excited to post content on my IG to share our experience. I've my celebrated birthdays, even planned birthdays and bachelorette dinners there. Once we noticed our friends were not as impressed, it was a disappointment.   Baku to me was not only known for their unique menu, but it was known for the Baku \"experience\".   My last birthday event was December 2015. After my party of 28 were all disappointed in the service.   Last week we decided to give it another chance for our anniversary. The waitress was nice, but food was bland!  My favorite sides were sweet potatoes and grilled corn.  The potatoes were undercooked, corn wasn't seasoned, Sushi was bland, pork belly didn't taste as good as it used to, Kumamoto oysters were a disappointment, (especially after the cost) Shrimp skewers were dry, grilled grouper was slimy... and drinks were not crafted like they used to be.   For a 200.00 meal, we had to pick up more food afterwards at another restaurant.  This was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We went to Baku for their brunch buffet today and I would NOT recommend their brunch to anyone.  We paid $36 a person and we were very disappointed with their food selection.  According to their brunch menu, they make you think you getting sashimi and nigiri part of their Buffet but instead we were told is $2 a piece if we would like to order their sashimi/nigiri.  If you read their brunch menu carefully, there is NO WHERE in the menu mention is a up charge.  Don't waste your money on their Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"A very rare 5 STAR review from myself goes to Baku.  Located right on Sharon road near Diamonds Direct - Baku is very easy to find.  We were here last Thursday night at the suggestion of other yelpers - Thanks guys!!!  They had valet parking right out front in case you didn't want to try to hunt down a spot.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs where you can be seated.  Downstairs has the excitement of the open kitchen and very nice decor.  Upstairs is a little sexier with a bar, lounge areas, high tops and low tables.  We were told to get a few small plates so we ended up with the pork dumplings (seared slightly on the bottom - comes with the house sauce - DIVINE), the peppers (I can't remember the name?!?!), tenderloin and asparagus skewers, pork belly skewers, and shrimp tempura.  Each dish was delectable, not too smoky.  Just the right amount of food for two people.  The wait staff was super attentive (although struggling with the restaurant's newness still....)  The decor and music - so sexy chic.  The hot towel service was a great touch.  I can't wait to go back and try new items.  Superb experience and truly a unique Charlotte dining experience."}
{"text":"As far as sushi goes in Charlotte goes, I have to say this is one of the better ones. I like the balance of rice and fish in the nigiri, its not often I find a sushi places doing it right. They also have robata so there is cook food if you don't eat raw. Baku is a high end restaurant so I'm not coming here every night as much as I would like too but if you do come you will be able to try lots of different kind of fish you won't find in charlotte expect maybe Yama Asian fusion. I come here when I want to fancy it up."}
{"text":"Very cool place. South Park area needs more establishments like Baku. I haven't eaten here yet but have been for drinks with friends. Nice place to lounge around with friends. Lots of unique drinks and service was excellent. Will def go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Japanese in Charlotte!   Went here on a whim with a friend and it didn't disappoint. The rolls were very well made and the presentation was excellent. The Alaskan crab roll was one of my favorites. The food is mostly tapas style meant to share... and most of the small plate portions are a little small.   Everything grilled is cooked on a Japanese grill with coals imported from Japan which gives it a very unique flavor. Their black cod was excellent... I'm gonna say it reminded me of Nobu's... though the execution was a little off. All their beef is prime, we also had the Waygu NY strip and it was delicious.   Cocktails were ok, nothing out of this world and the service was decent. Overall I think they did a good job, albeit the NY city prices... this is a place good for an expense account."}
{"text":"Extremely refined food.  The blue fin toro nigiri with osetra caviar was luxurious.  Great cocktails and great wine list.  New to the neighborhood and will return."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. A different type of sushi than I usually go for but very good rolls and sauces. I generally go with traditional sushi and they don't vary from the menu. Small vat of sake so you will have to order a couple. Pretty pricey for my liking."}
{"text":"I love the presentations at Baku, each dish is beautifully presented and food is just as good.  It is on the pricey side but you can see it on their quality and presentation.  They also make great desserts, everything house made supposedly.  Recommend for date nights, company dinners and birthday."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was lovely and food was delicious, but be sure to bring your wallet!"}
{"text":"From my research only place to get butterfish/black cod in Charlotte and it did not let me down. Make a reservation or plan to wait. Small portions meant to share. Slightly over priced for what you get but despite this will be back for that black cod."}
{"text":"2 stars only because the service was phenomenal and my date was a 10. However we were advised to try the chefs tasting (forgive me I dk what it was called) it was listed on the menu as $100. It was $100 a person which was well over priced and was not specified by the waiter. For $300 we were underwhelmed by charcoal and teriyaki flavored every thing. Go somewhere else in the South Park area. Much better options within one mile."}
{"text":"Ordered the tiger prawn last night to accompany a salad & wine BUT I was brought shrimp tempura instead; without any questions or explanation of the substitution. Not sure if they thought I wouldn't notice, but I definitely do know the difference between a PRAWN and a factory farmed SHRIMP. lol"}
{"text":"Found this place late at night when we were craving for sushi. Got sat immediately for a big party in the PDR, and we got the best service! SERIOUSLY!! We tried many dishes and I was surprised this place served duck! It's phenomenal! They are also doing limited rare fishes and the live uni is urching-good(sea-urchin)! Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"It's my first time visiting Charlotte. My boyfriend and few his friends took me to Baku. The foods are outstanding!!! I went to Morimoto in Philadelphia a month ago. I think the foods here are comparable to Morimoto. We ordered a lot dishes to try. My favorites were Sea scallops with foie gras?and wagyu beef. My boyfriend liked the duck breast, and salmon belly. I would like to come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner on a Friday night and we had such a great experience. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Neither myself nor my boyfriend knew what sake to get since they have such an extensive list and our server listened to what we liked and brought out a great selection. Additionally, we had no clue what food to get, and our server again took the time to figure out what we liked to eat and made some recommendations that were right on point. I had the chicken entree and it was delicious. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, food was good, but not wonderful. I have had many meals in Charlotte that were much better, for the price."}
{"text":"A group of friends tried BAKU during Queensfeast/restaurant week.  Service here was wonderful and food was delicious.  We had one mistake during the evening and it was a steak not being cook according to ordered.  The wait staff and management could not have been any nicer and fixed it immediately.   We will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Wow, thought I had already reviewed this place but apparently not.  Well for starters you have to love the interiors.  As stated in some of the other reviews, the upstairs area is preferred if you are looking to lounge.  I loved the ambiance of the place.    We came on their first official night open so there were some kinks in the armor, mostly relative to bar menu and drink selection but the service was friendly and prompt none the less.  The food was fantastic, the pork belly melts in your mouth and the shrimp tempura was divine.  The peppers we had were incredible and although considered a small plate, I found the portions to be fairly large enough for two."}
{"text":"Liked the decor and the server was extremely knowledgable . The drinks were on the weak side but I'm sure it was just a measured pour. We enjoyed the food we had the giant Madagascar prawn, the pork belly skewers, 2 different sushi rolls one was a blue fin tuna ,the other was crab and we started with the roasted oysters . The oysters were my favorite item, exceptional flavor and had me looking forward to what was next , all the food was prepared and presented exceptionally well but other than the oysters i wasnts \"wowed\" by any of the flavors.  We understood the portions were small as the menu is all Tapas style..( don't go looking for a large portion meal)  The mango cake and the chocolate lava cake were our  deserts they were also very good, the mango cake was a little dry. We like to eat at a lot of high end restaurants and expect to pay for it but I thought Baku was a little over priced for what it was.  It is a great place to meet for a cocktail then a couple of apps before dinner elsewhere ... Didn't hate it and had a great evening but not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Lovely new little spot! Went here for restaurant week and it was refreshing to know they didn't over book.  Downstairs and upstairs seating, bar on both levels. Our party was upstairs and I was able to get a small drink prior,  House sangria. It was average. They said they added Sprite normally to the drink,  which to wasn't the best idea.   Food overall was really good. Small plates, but all 3 courses were delicious.  For apps,  I had Pork Belly, main course, steak with Wasabi sauce, and dessert, Creme Brule.  Each course was better than the last and surprisingly filling.   A bonus to me is that it's smack dab in the center of 2 bank locations in Southpark. So weekend dining, you always have a parking spot. Not really much congestion.   Only con, I could give is that I wish there were bigger plates with more food!"}
{"text":"Foodgasmic oysters and king crab legs!!  Seriously, they are MIND-BLOWING amazing!  I am a lover of fresh seafood, especially oysters and crab legs; it is very rare to find oysters and crab legs that blow my mind because it all essentially tastes the same.  That said, I also had a range of very good, good enough and blech dishes at the same meal; hence, the 4 stars.  OK AMBIENCE.  We have seen Baku numerous times on our way to South Park Mall and wondered if it was like Zuma (my BFs all-time favorite restaurant upon which all other pan-Asian | Asian fusion restaurants are compared).  The answer?  Not quite.  There is a cute patio outside that was much too hot for us to enjoy, maybe next time.    Inside, it tries to be trendy and hip like a Morimoto, Hakkasan or any other modern vibey LA/Miami Asian restaurant but sort of falls flat and feels a little dated and underwhelming.  I can't quite put my finger on what makes me feel this way, maybe the really bad lighting or the cramped quarters (even though the restaurant was sparsely attended).  It just didn't feel upscale (and not in the minimalist way either).   MEDIOCRE SERVICE.  The service was exactly on par with what you would expect from an upscale restaurant.   There was nothing remarkable about the service.  They can improve by wiping down the table between courses when they're clearing off the plates.  This isn't something that I usually notice but if I feel like I need to put my napkin on top of my table, that's a really good sign that it needs a good wipe down.  Overall, the service was fine; our food was served, cleared away and drinks refilled promptly and courteously.    ALCOHOL.  We had a Moscow mule and a fruity concoction that I asked the bartender to prepare; they were heavy on the alcohol pour but mixed wonderfully as to maintain their intended flavors.    A WIDE ARRAY OF CULINARY PERFORMANCE.  If it weren't for the oysters and crab legs, I may have given the experience 3 or 3.5 stars, right around average.  I've had:   AMAZING:  +++  oysters. When they were served, we were told to be prepared to have the best oyster experience ever. He was absolutely right.  I usually want to throw all the fixings on: cocktail sauce, horseradish, tabasco, salt, pepper, and lime -- but the sweetness, and the soft buttery texture of these divine oysters eradicated the need for the extras.  It was like these oysters weren't farmed in the ocean at all, they didn't have any salty or gritty texture to them at all; truly,  they were unlike any of their usual counterparts. +++  Alaskan crab legs. The crab legs were meaty, sweet and didn't have a fishy aftertaste at all.  They serve it in this heavenly lemon butter ponzu sauce that just perfectly complements the sweetness.  The portion is huge enough that my BF and I barely polished it off.    VERY GOOD:  +++  crispy rock shrimp.  The shrimps were crispy and served with a hot mustard sauce, very similar to Zuma. +++  traditional miso. It threw me off that it's sweet and a little sour but the fresh scallops in it really made me grow fond of it.   +++  spicy tuna roll. Very fresh, densely complex and quite spicy.    OK:  +++  yellowtail.  You get three rolled up pieces.  This is fine if it was more complex than plain yellowtail such as a nice ponzu sauce or crispy tempura flakes (like Zuma does); it was good but not stellar.   +++  panacotti.  The fruit panacotti had vanilla custard that was pretty bland.  I'm not one for over decadent sweetness but the panacotti seemed to err at the opposite spectrum and left my palate wanting more.   BLECH:  +++  salmon tatake.  I LOVE albacore tatake that sits on a semi-sweet citrus ponzu sauce with stripped daikon.  This wasn't it.  The salmon is cooked, even with the fresh crab,  it's really not the right texture to turn into a tatake.   +++  mango toffee.  Too many nuts, the very dense cake didn't taste like mango -- Starbucks could have done a better dessert.   +++  pork belly.  The pieces are REALLY fatty and greasy; not in the savory bacon (yum!) way.  COME FOR THE OYSTERS AND CRAB LEGS.   If the oysters and king crab had been your run-of-the-mill variety, we probably wouldn't return because other than that, the only thing we would order again are the crispy shrimp.  However, the oysters and king crab legs are absolutely incredible and worth every penny of their market price tag.    10.7.2016 Update.  We went for a second time on a rainy Friday night and because it was busier, the service was slower.  I'd skip the desserts altogether next time.    I can see why others say that the portions are not commensurate to the hefty price tag.  I will definitely vouch for the freshness and premium quality of their seafood (for example, in contrast, Cowfish uses imitation crab in their rolls).  That being said,  if you come here, stick to the popular food items or fresh sushi because not everything on their menu will otherwise garner a satiating dining experience."}
{"text":"Get the pork belly! It's so flavorful and so well cooked that I don't think I've had better. You won't be disappointed.   Service was great too, considering we went on a weekend. Our waiter Bob was extremely patient with our group. He explained what was currently popular for us to try.   Anyway, I can't wait to go back with my friend's birthday coming up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the various tapas here aside from the slow service.  I recommend ordering everything at once or else your dinner could be over two hours just waiting on a simple alcohol beverage or tapas.  It's a great atmosphere but the service is a little slow.  I highly recommend the uni spoon, very flavorful and delicious and it's $10 a spoon.  If you like uni and quail egg it's really worth it.  Also their raw Kumamoto oysters are the best and most expensive oysters I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not great. REALLY EXPENSIVE... there are half a dozen restaurants that do something better for cheaper. I thought it was a joke restaurant"}
{"text":"Date night and we love sushi! To start off....the food was DELICIOUS! Each item we ordered was more delicious than the last! That being said, I cannot understand the low quality of service. Each server seemed to have a sense of arrogance. A different server brought us the wrong plate and when we asked him about the one we were supposed to have, he responded with \"how would I know, I'm not your server, but I will go ask him.\" We sat at the sushi bar and went through most of the meal without ever speaking to a server again?? We poured our own wine all night, and sat with empty plates for 15 minutes before we asked for our check. Our server apologized for the lack of service and hospitality and offered to buy us a drink at the lounge upstairs & the bartender did take great care of us. I would have given Baku 4 or 5 stars but the lack of service brought it down. The restaurant would be great with just an improvement in service and hospitality."}
{"text":"OK, we moved out of Southpark and have little reason to want to go back (just a boutique or two for me). Tried Baku again. Small bites, Calamari, Beef & Asparagus & their incredible mushrooms. Not nearly the crowd they once had. We don't order the Chicken Yakatori anymore since I found myself chewing and swallowing what I suddenly realized was chicken cooked on the outside and raw on the inside. I panicked then (last thing I need is Salmonella) & our server said they had just sent an order of that back for the same reason - there is a special way to cook done on the Robata grill, and if they get it wrong (chefs keep changing - not master chef I think but whoever is on the Robata, and they mess up). And again I reiterate - THEY KEEP BLASTING THIS HORRIFIC, ELECTRONIC, DARK AND MISERY INDUCING MUSIC. We sat outside before 6PM when nobody was there, so we asked they turn it way down outside. It was done and someone then turned it way back up. This is a pricey place, supposed to be a Japanese restaurant and any music should be soft, melodic and Japanese - not ELECTRONIC DRECK. Staff were all wonderful, so who is the nincompoop who insists on blasting lousy \"music\" that has no place anywhere other than a PORNO FLICK? Mr. \"Owner\" - are you listening, or are you just one of those \"old boys club\" guys who currently run this town/city? You are getting slammed on your salon Cutting Image and your casual BBQ place \"Tree House\".? No plans to go back to any of them. Better give a raise to your staff, I don't know how they can stand working there, they must all be good actors."}
{"text":"Baku was good, but somewhat expensive. I understand that the Japanese charcoal cooking method is unique and more costly. Not a bad experience. Just wasn't a wow."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Charlotte.  Try the ribs, tempura shrimp, pork dumplings and New York strip.  You won't be disappointed.  Great cocktails."}
{"text":"A recent encore visit to Baku reinforced what a tremendous restaurant this really is. We started with a splendid Calamari appetizer, which was flavorful, crisp and delicious. The Wagyu Tataki and Lobster rolls that followed were wonderful, especially when paired with a steaming bowl of the Wild Mushroom Kamameshi and a refreshing Asahi Super Dry lager. We finished the meal with a sumptuous slice of chocolate cake with white chocolate mousse -- a fantastic ending to another amazing meal at one of Charlotte's best restaurants."}
{"text":"It is absolutely blowing my mind that this place doesn't have the 5 star rating it deserves. Every single thing we have ever had here, every time we come, is AMAZING! If you're a fan of Soul (in plaza Midwood), or O-ku in atherton mill, then you will LOVE what this place has to offer. Fantastic selection of apps (the tartare and the tempura cod bites are out of this world good), and the prices are reasonable IMO. There's almost never a wait either, so that's a huge plus. I'm not sure what's up with the other people (maybe they consider Applebees good eats), but from one foodie to another, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Quality was good. Presentation was beautiful. Service was ok. They should've changed out our plates at least once during dinner as our plates were drenched in oils and flavors from the other dishes. The Uni Spoon ($10/each) was my favorite... had the perfect amount of caviar, truffle and uni, and the blend with the ponzu and quail egg was great! The A5-12 Japanese Wagyu Beef Nigiri ($8/pierce) with Burgundy Truffle and Hon Shiso was another one of my favorites.   I was very disappointed in the Salmon Belly Nigiris as that was what drew me into wanting to go to this restaurant. The salmon belly was fresh but the flavor was off because the chef had a big dab of mayonnaise on each piece.  The flavors did not go together and the mayonnaise took away the flavor of the fish. I feel that this was my main problem with this restaurant... the combination of flavors just did not go together. They would have fresh ingredients that are amazing even all on its own but then they would add something that overpowers the main ingredient. Another example was the yellowtail sashimi ($12 for 3 pieces)... the yellowtail was great, the truffle ponzu sauce was great but then they added this overpowering pickled smoky onion in it which in my opinion, totally ruined the dish and seems like such a waste of good quality fish. They could've added some onions but not so much where it was more than the fish itself. Another example was the Foiegras and Scallop dish ($28 for 2)... foiegras.. perfectly cooked, flavor was great... scallop... perfectly cooked, flavor was on point... and then they add this mint leaf that tasted like licorice in the middle which totally caught me by surprise and added this overpowering, pungent flavor that had a bitter aftertaste. Overall, good experience but disappointed in the dishes I was most excited to try."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Baku for a weeknight dinner date during Queen's Feast. We've heard great things about the place and definitely were not disappointed.  Atmosphere:  Cool, eclectic vibe. Host, bussers, and waiters were very attentive and personable.   Food Must-Haves:  -Chili-glazed edamame. My mouth waters just typing about it - it was seriously SO good. Do it. -Brussels sprouts were also delicious.  -Potstickers are also a very solid choice. Ours were piping hot and the dipping sauce was very tasty.  -Robata Grilled Atlantic Salmon (entree) was seriously one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had.  -Green Tea Creme Brulee (because it's creme brulee...duh)  So-So items: -Spicy Himachi Rice Krispie Treat (appetizer)... didn't taste like much, and definitely NOT spicy (bummer). Nothing to write home about. -USDA Prime NY Strip... pretty fatty, came out in thin strips. Again, nothing to write home about.   Overall, we'll be back, Restaurant Week or not!"}
{"text":"We were so incredibly pleased with our Restaurant Week experience at Baku! The food was great, portions were reasonable (I'd heard otherwise) and our server, Bob, was fantastic! We enjoyed it so much we took advantage of the Queens Feast AAA special on our way out and bought $200 worth of gift cards for $100. So, we'll be back, Baku!   To the food... We shared the edamame, crispy brussel sprouts, fried calamari, petite nigiri, salmon, skirt steak, pear fortune cookies and chocolate truffles with raspberry coulis. The ONLY dish I didn't love was the salmon but I am admittedly a picky salmon eater. My favorite of the night was the skirt steak, hands down. A big, 8-oz. portion, perfectly cooked and served with a yummy dipping sauce. Runner up was the nigiri -- each piece came topped with something different (a dill cream on the salmon, cilantro on the tuna, etc.) that really highlighted the flavor and freshness of each piece of fish.   The atmosphere was fun! We were in a booth towards the back (near the samurai room -- aka men's bathroom) which allowed for conversation with our friends. The restaurant is dark and has a swanky feel. Glad I decided to wear a dress. Felt like a real night out on the town! But, for only $35.00 per person thanks to Queens Feast! I'm withholding my 5th star until I visit outside of restaurant week and can judge regular menu items and service."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and had excellent experiences every time. Creative menu and presentation. Excellent service. Can get pretty busy so reservations recommended.   I find myself craving their hamachi jalapeño roll. It is my new favorite sushi roll (I tend to like simpler rolls to the fried, zillion-ingredient versions). My son swears that their spicy filet (?) is the best steak he has had next to Ruth's Chris. He orders it every time we go- and eats the whole thing!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!!! I have been here about 6 time now and it has always been above par. The service is just as good as well. HOWEVER, the last time I was here the 2 young hostess had a serious issue with I guess being at work on a weekend. They were extremely rude to my party and I and gave us stank looks the entire time as we were seated in the front.  With that being said I will no longer be visiting this establishment. But again the food is amazing the the wait staff lives up to the expectation you should come to expect within that price range."}
{"text":"Baku is worth every penny! My husband and I have been several times. The tuna tartar and scallops are delicious!!! We also loved the duck and cod. The only dish I would not recommend is the rock shrimp. It tasted like your basic fried shrimp, rather plain.  If I could eat here every weekend I would."}
{"text":"We LOVED our experience! Food was incredible, a true work of art, very fresh! Drinks we're great and our server was very informative. The only downside was that the music was a little too loud! Other than that, amazing experience. We will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for Queen's Feast and it was pretty good, but pretty expensive. We ordered off the Queen's Feast menu and ended up ordering more food off the regular menu because of the small portions. We were still hungry, but decided to go elsewhere that was cheaper to fill up on food. Also, the brussels sprouts here are good and they have fried onion flakes that move from the heat which looks pretty cool."}
{"text":"Halloween night dinner!   I wanted to pick a fun place for dinner that would have a festive theme - but I wanted something different. Baku was it. They had a DJ set up that gave the upstairs area a fun vibe, and there were a handful of people dressed up.   I made reservations and my party was seated at a comfortable table behind the bar. We noted the cool decor along with a few funky Halloween items.   The wine list is neat: they have a few unusual items. I tried the Bollini Pinot Grigio, and my friends took part in the specials. The prices were fair on drinks - this is a nice place in a great location so don't expect dive-bar prices.   The food comes in a tapas/sharing style. I split the Robata skewer of tofu, and the Tempura Rock Shrimp. My other friends had the salmon, dumplings, sushi, and it all looked really good! On the next trip, I plan to try some of the substantial dinner plates.  With the way they made the tofu taste awesome, I'm excited to see what else they have to offer.  The waitress was very attentive to our large, festive group, and kept checking on us between her other tables. Even though it was a busy night, the service was consistently good.  I'm planning on coming again."}
{"text":"I had dinner here and it was amazing! I wish I could eat here every day! The inside is decorated very nicely and is very clean. The food has so much flavor, and the service is great! I recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"I sat with Chad at the Sushi Bar and had a memorable meal. I tried so hard to enjoy every bite, it was so flavorful. Salmon tataki, Wagyu tartare, black cod are MUST haves.  Chad was awesome, exceptional service all around, great menu, nice wine selection. This place ranks up there with some of the best restaurants in San Fran and NYC.  Just go!"}
{"text":"the decor is nice, kind of upscale rustic.  I love the sound panels on the ceiling.  what a great idea.  The food... Grouper Bites... a bit oily, not crisped up, but still tasty.  I also loved the green tea-infused salt.  That was new and interesting.    Pork Dumplings, again, oily, and a little thick in the skin, chewy.    Tenderloin Skewer...sort of bland.  The pricing is what I'd expect for Charlotte, but I don't think the food rates those prices.  We sat at the bar downstairs, which is a nice bar, but smaller.  Our bartenders were very nice but one bartender was really loud and he would make loud comments about what he was watching on sports center and when he was chatting with other staff it was obtrusive.  Also in the bar area... everyone from the kitchen staff, managers, hostesses... would come behind the bar to fill up their drinks, get ice, check out what was going on on sports center, chat....  It was really a bit irritating.  The bar isn't that big and although I would choose to sit further away from the tv side if I'm eating at the bar next time - it was just odd that it is set up that way.  I recommend people try it and I definitely want to sit upstairs next time."}
{"text":"The service was and is more than disrespectful. I have never heard such blatant racist crap in my life. I'm here to have dinner and seen a best friend of mine, whom was having a birthday dinner. To prevent making this story to long, I was told that we were an inconvenience. Of course my friend had many that stopped by to say hi and she didn't pay their \"$500 reservation fee\" but I  came to eat and wanted a table. The manage decided to give me a 20 minute explanation than to just clean the table and seat my party of 4. The food is awesome, no doubt but for the manager to feel as though a paying customer is an inconvenience because I didn't look like the other party was disgraceful. Let me not forget to mention that we stood their for 15 minutes as the staff walked past us without even acknowledging our existence. The manager did let me know he isn't under a corporation so he can do as he pleased. Wow is all I have... Maybe he forgot about social media and its ability to bring awareness and change.   Never have to worry about me coming again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  My first time and the range of flavors and unique combinations will blow your mind.  This is my new favorite in South Park."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in south Charlotte. Been here twice. Very fresh and well prepared. They have great by the bottle wine/sake specials. Posh and trendy atmosphere. It draws all sorts of crowds...I've seen business people by their lonesome eating and working, couples night out, and large group parties. The upstairs lounge is really a great place to unwind and also eat. Parking isn't too bad. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I been looking  for my favorite sushi place ever since we moved to Charlotte area 8 months ago. By far, this is my favorite sushi place. Smaller portions ( don't expect the usually big rolls from  them) .  They are pretty small but big in flavor.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today, the food was amazing! The meal was a preset menu. It was good. I'll be back soon. For sure."}
{"text":"Baku is arguably the best restaurant in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte:   Tiger shrimp Blue fin toro tartare Spicy hamachi rice crispy treat Big hourany roll Salmon belly nigiri"}
{"text":"Best dinner spot in Charlotte... By a long run. Small plates are fun and allow you to order a little of everything.  I did not have one dish I didn't like.  The only reason we stopped ordering was because we were full."}
{"text":"Great food, intelligent service (they know the menu, flavors, and options), and ambiance. Good wine choices!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give Baku a 4 or even 5 star review, but the service we just had was pretty disappointing. We went in for Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and everything we ate was pretty tasty. We added on the pork belly skewers per our server's recommendation, and it was delicious! The biggest issue here was attentiveness of our waiter. He was very friendly and enthusiastic, however, it wasn't even that busy, yet we frequently ran out of water. We also asked about sake when we placed our order, yet the expert did not come around to explain until the end of our meal. One of our dishes was forgotten, and we had to remind him we ordered it. Worst of all, when we were ready to leave, it was very difficult to get the check, and we had to even ask another waiter to ring it up for us. Again, the food was above average, but overall, we expected better service.  Update: After writing this review, my boyfriend went to Whole Foods to buy a sandwich because he was still hungry. Not exactly what you want after a $100+ meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to Baku for the first time on my birthday. The service was wonderful and food presentation was excellent. We ordered the pork dumplings, chicken wings, spicy tuna roll, and the butter fish. Everything was just ok. Asian food is my favorite cuisine. I have eaten at Asian restaurants all over the country and this is one of the lowest on my list. Maybe the chef was off tonight, I don't know, but he or she must not have been tasting the food. During dinner we even starting discussing what we were going to eat when we got home. Unfortunately this visit was a fail for us, and we may not be coming back."}
{"text":"Restaurant week is always a good time to try new places that are at a higher price point.  Bakus restaurant week menu is $35 plus $5 extra for dessert.  Walking in the ambiance is so perfect.  It's romantic and quiet which makes for a nice evening meal.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated immediately.  I always love when restaurants do that!  We ordered some drinks and then placed our order off of the restaurant week menu.  I got the edamame, pork dumplings, NY strip, and split the chocolate cake and beignets for dessert.  I was a little disappointed that dessert was $5 extra on the restaurant week menu, but both desserts were so good I wanted to lick the plate   Let me say that all of my courses were incredible.  I loved everything!  The portions were enough to fill me up and I ate every last thing on my plate.  The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the kitchen was very backed up.  It took forever to get each course.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept our drinks full though!"}
{"text":"Wife pick Baku today to try during restaurant week. The restaurant has a very nice relaxed atmosphere and very clean restrooms. We didn't know this was a tapas restaurant and the portions are, IMO very small compared to other Tapas restaurants. The food was EXCELLENT!! Our server Dave was very attentive and answered any and all questions we had. He also made recommendations on the restaurant week menu and explained the ingredients and how it was made. I recommend eating a snack or something before you go or look forward to digging down close to your knee to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service impeccable, atmosphere was amazing!  I will definitely be back!  The pork dumplings were tender and flavorful and the rock shrimp tempura were perfectly seasoned and piping hot when the arrived at our table- the perfect way to start our meal. Next we tried the butterfish which was unlike anything I've ever tasted- the butterfish, white asparagus and sauce came together and were nothing short of magic. The spicy filet of beef was cooked perfectly and so tender that I was easily able to eat it with my chop sticks, and the sauce was heavenly. Then we enjoyed the largest king crab leg I have ever seen, with sweet local corn and baby artichokes.  Please do not leave this restaurant without having dessert, we tried the dark chocolate espresso truffles with sour cherry sauce and cinnamon/ginger snap ice cream-  i could eat that dessert everyday for the rest of my life and never tire of it.  Long story short it was the type of dining experience that makes you want to call all of your friends and demand that they to go experience the wonder that is Baku! I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I had two roles there. One was a sort of spicey tuna and the other was a wagyu with pickled something with truffles. They both were amazing. The ambiance was amazing. My next trip I'll be getting the wagyu tomahawk ribeye."}
{"text":"A new Izakaya restaurant, very posh and upscale.    I expected an izakaya to be less formal and less stiff. More of a watering hole for the tired salaryman but this place has turned the local watering hole into a semi-formal dining establishment. Lots of uniformed waiters, a sake sommelier, a valet.. its just a wierd vibe for an izakaya.  The clientele is all dressed up for dinner, in heels and all. Kinda snobby.  Service is impeccable. They will take very good care of you. Our server was cordial and attentive.  We just about ate everything on the menu. Even had their Nanbu Bijin Dai Ginjo. Kitchen is fast. Our skewers came very quickly.  The best is the scallops and prok belly. So good, we asked for 2 more plate. The Omakase, at $60 for 3 was expensive.  There simply wasn't enough to justify $60 for 3.  I would say the portion was enough for 1 person.  All the other plates were OK.  Nothing too spectacular.  Sake list is good. They had a few bottles from JunMai to DaiGinjo. We had the KiKuSui , which came is such a small 300ml bottle is was pathetic. We stepped up and got the $150 Nanbu Bijin that was much better. The next time , I would ask them to sit the bottle in a bed of ice. I kinda like my sake colder.  Anyway, its not your typical relaxed, let your hair down, end of the day, drop your butt down and drink your tired day away of an Izakaya.  People actually dress up and come here to be seen. Sorta different vibe, sorta pretentious..but damn good service.  It is on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We made reservations an hour before we arrived on a Saturday night and had to wait a few minutes for our table, which was fine because we was able to check out other parts of the restaurant. Giving this restaurant 3.5 stars because of the pricing in comparison to portion size.  The food here was delicious and the atmosphere was lively. Our service started out a bit slow, but it gradually got better after we had ordered our small plates. The items came out as they were done, which was perfect because we were able to enjoy and savor each dish separately.    As a caution, this restaurant is very pricy so if you come here be ready for a big bill. We had 4 cocktails and shared 7 small plates/sushi rolls and our total came to $260.   Also, the valet is complimentary too."}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. My SO and I went for the first time during Queen's Feast, and despite the crowd, the service was phenomenal. We were about 30 minutes early for our reservation, which the staff wasn't able to find, so we went to the bar for a drink while we waited for our table. Despite not being able to find our OpenTable reservation for 8:30 and the restaurant being at capacity, the staff handled the situation exceptionally well and we were seated at a table at 8:30 with no problem. Service in the bar was a little slow while we waited for our table, but the bar was standing room only, so that may have contributed to the slow service. There was a live DJ in the bar, which my SO and I really enjoyed. After being moved to our table we had a wonderful server and bar drinks came much faster. We had 6 different dishes, which was a perfect amount for the 2 of us. If we went back, I think 4-5 would be plenty though. While all of the food was good, there were some definite stand outs. The sweet chili edamame was one of my favorites, as were the rice krispy treats. My only complaint was that my salmon was probably closer to medium well than medium, but it was still tasty. My two biggest complaints were that they only had 1 restroom stall for the ladies' room, which created a line at times. And it was unbelievably hot inside the restaurant - this may have been due to the number of people, but other yelpers lead me to believe this might be an ongoing problem. Overall, I was very happy with our experience at Baku and the SO and I would certainly go back! I do strongly recommend making a reservation, as table space is limited and it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"Swanky, sophisticated, and stylish.  I've really enjoyed the food each trip here. My most recent visit was for a large birthday dinner. My side of the table ordered a bunch of things to split. Shout out to Yelpers who post pics. We definitely nailed our order because of Yelp photos. The skirt steak and spicy hamachi crispy treat were the two main stars and standouts. Pork belly skewers were also delicious. We also got a couple sushi rolls, fried chicken, rock shrimp tempura, spicy edamame, and shishito peppers. All great. I tried bites of both the spicy filet and the strip, the skirt steak beat both of them.   For a large group, our two servers did a fantastic job. My service is always great. I recommend making a reservation beforehand. Note: half price wine on Mondays.  I will say that Baku is kind of pricey for what it is, but I still come back. Highly recommend making a visit here during Charlotte Restaurant Week (January & July)."}
{"text":"Really great food, service started out great with the hostess being attentive to get us seated on a busy Sat night.  Upstairs is very dark and loud for dinner.  Server was great until he checked out without communicating that to us.  Once we were bartender's table our level of service fell.  And the bar's trash odor kept hitting my nose in waves.  No offer for coffee with dessert and really just a disappointing end.  Highlight of our meal was pork belly skewer with Dumplings a strong second."}
{"text":"Japanese Fusion... Went there for my Wife's Birthday with her Brother and my Sister-in-Law... Excellent! A bit pricey, but Excellent... The food was amazing, the service was amazing and the desserts were also - Amazing! The Best Sazerac I have ever had! Highly recommend, we will go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I selected this for her farewell dinner from Charlotte. This is a terrific addition to the South Park culinary scene - the ambiance and decor are warm and welcoming. We ordered the forbidden and spicy gokujo rolls (I preferred the spicy rolls) which were both good. The tofu skewer was crisp and excellent with the chili sauce that accompanied it. The kimchi bowl was a real treat, which I wasn't expecting from a Japanese restaurant. The sorbet dessert was ok. Timing of the food delivery was perfect, and the host was very attentive. Glad I came here (even though it was a hit to the wallet) and would recommend it for a nice evening out with friends."}
{"text":"Living in the Southpark area, I had heard from many that Baku was a 'must-go' restaurant. We finally decided to try it out this week for Queen's Feast. I ordered the Hidden Hibiscus cocktail and it was bubbly & refreshing. The music was audible but wasn't too loud that we could not hear ourselves speak. We were unaware that the menu was Japanese 'tapas' style, but our server gave us a long rehearsed speech about the menu and restaurant style.   The Queen's Feast selections were described well on the menu but the portions were rather small. The spicy chili edamame was great, but edamame isn't hard to mess up. I ordered a type of maki roll with yellowtail; it came out in 4 tiny pieces. The tiger prawn & vegetable tempura consisted of 2 skinny tiger prawns, a 1/4 of a mushroom, 2 asparagus stalks and a piece of eggplant. Quite disappointing.   I am glad we went here for the reduced price during Queen's Feast as opposed to paying triple the price on a regular night. I wouldn't rush back here again."}
{"text":"Someone led us to this awesome place. They got really wonderful sushi and sashimi. Roast beef and chicken are also yummy. The only drawback is that it's a little expensive hh."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember my bartenders name. He was absolutely on point . Upstairs bar. Feeling a little home sick , missing the southwest spice. He made me feel right at home with a Serrano pepper mottled in my vodka grapefruit juice. The staff went out of there way to make us feel welcome. They made us some specialty rolls that were not on the menu and were on top of every need or want. These guys are truly a class act!!!! Definitely go out of your way to visit this place!!! Amazing ambiance!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Baku is a baby born in a different city. Something charlotte has needed for years. Its pricey, but depending on your selection, it doesn't have to be. The food is insanely good, with a robata grill that doesnt disappoint. 25 specialty cocktails has something for everyone...a true gem amongst a typical crowd of charlotte run of the mill/generic repeats. The interior design shows true effort across the board. A welcomed addition to the southpark area."}
{"text":"I read other reviews and had high hopes for Baku since sushi is one of my favs.  I was reallly disappointed.  We got there at 6pm on a Friday night.  Being across from the mall you would have expected this place to be packed. Maybe that should have been my sign.  There were only 3 customers.  A lady at the bar, me, and my honey.  We were seated and it took 5 mins before the waiter came over.  The server was nice enough.  The only thing more plentiful than customers were nats!  We kept having to swat our food and drinks.  Geez. We ordered 2 miso soups(red and traditional ) and 2 apps(baked oysters and seared tuna). My honey usually has no strong reactions to food but we agreed...horrible. Oysters fishy and not fresh - i almost resorted to spitting the one I ate in my napkin.  Seared tuna was absolutely tasteless. The soups were ok. We decided to leave after a disappointing start and fighting nats in hopes of salvaging our night out.  Maybe it was just an off night for Baku- but bad enough for me to have no desire to return."}
{"text":"BF & I dined here this past Saturday. We got here a little before 630 & apparently the entire restaurant was booked with reservations, with the exception of the bar & the patio. It was pretty nice outside, so we decided to sit out on the patio. Our server was extremely knowledgeable. They have an extensive list of sake, & I'm not a sake expert but I decided you can't go wrong with the flavored ones. I got the fuji apple sake & my BF opted for the lychee sake.. both were great but the fuji apple was my favorite!  They have a few vegetarian items on the menu. The ones I remember are coal roasted shishito peppers, a couple of mushroom maki rolls, some type of sweet & sour tofu skewer, & wild mushroom kamameshi pot. I decided to get the peppers & was almost going to choose one of the sushi rolls, but I decided to try the kamameshi pot instead. The peppers do come with bonito flakes sprinkled on top, so we got them in a separate little bowl. My BF got the tempura tiger prawns, beef & asparagus skewers, & soft shell crab maki roll.  The shishito peppers came out first. They were tasty & not really spicy. They came with a little dipping sauce made of soy sauce & chili flakes. $7 was a little steep for a plate of peppers but I enjoyed them & would get them again.  The tempura tiger prawns came out next.. $12 for 5 pieces of fried shrimp.. what?? I kind of laughed when the prawns came out because at that price we were expecting at least ONE more to make it an even $2 per prawn. I did not eat them & while my BF seemed to like the prawns, he said they weren't really anything special.  Next up was the wild mushroom kamameshi pot. It came to the table unstirred, but I was unable to get a picture of it at the time because our server stirred it while explaining the dish. I enjoyed the flavors but again felt it was overpriced at $17 for some rice, mushrooms, & a few vegetables. The nice touch was that the rice on the bottom was a little crispy from the hot pot.. love it!  My BF got his beef & asparagus skewers (I think it came with 2) & soft shell crab roll. The skewers looked much better in person than that shitty picture I posted (blame the BF for that!) I think he liked the skewers & the roll was comparable to Cowfish prices but definitely not in size & taste.. Cowfish wins that hands down! I don't remember the exact prices of these 2 dishes individually, but together they must have been around $25 based on our bill.  Overall, the service was great, sake was awesome, & the food, while good, was definitely overpriced. We weren't particularly blown away by any of the dishes which is kinda disappointing for a meal close to $100 (including the tip). We will probably be back because my BF wants to try the duck & a couple of other grilled meat dishes, but Baku will likely not be in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Baku ,this has been our\"go to\" spot and best place to dine since coming here for visiting , Do not let the prices on the menu hold you back ,The establishment and the layout is phenomenal and the dining area is expansive.  And their dishes were exceptional .very creative and eye enticing .we can't remember everything we had (not good at naming dishes ) but basically ,everything was very unique and top notch .if u r a dessert fan ,(like me )definitely try their Yuzu Tart and Akuma (Pistachio Gelato) ?service was a bit slow but still on point ."}
{"text":"Melange of colors, Thing of beauty and tastes good, Just get the sorbet.  Place is overhyped, Pay too much for what you get, Baku, not Haiku?"}
{"text":"After hearing many mixed reviews on this restaurant, I finally got to experience Baku.  For starters, as expected, the restaurant was indeed stylish...a cozy mix of rustic and city-chic decor.  Then came THE disappointment for the entire dining experience...the TINY table.  As I often dine out with my husband, it's fairly normal that we get the smaller tables in  most restaurants, but here at Baku, the table for two seemed a tad smaller than norm.  It might not have bothered me much if we simply opted for simple entree plates.  However, as recommended by the waiter, this was a restaurant that specialized in smaller plates (AKA tapas-style!).  Since the menu did feature many tantalizing appetizers and tapas-style items, we proceeded ordering at least half a dozen plates, along with soup, dessert and drinks.  Our table was completely overwhelmed...and honestly, it was an aggravating, near-claustrophobic foodie experience.  The menu was delightful, with many unique items...and all the foods were delicious.  I do want to add that some of their items, like the sushi that I ordered was way overpriced for what it was...but again, delicious.  Also, the waiter was very good...an obvious pro with years of experience.  Overall, I did like what Baku had to offer.  If my dining experience was more comfortable (bigger table!), I might have even given this 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here last night for restaurant week...one of the best experiences I've had recently! The sea bass was incredible, and the sushi was the freshest I've ever had in Charlotte. The cocktails were delicious and the service was very attentive. Definitely recommend this for a date night."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again!! This was the worst racist place ever!!! Went there for my friends birthday just to have drinks. We ordered food and several other people she knew came as well! About 7:30, 4 other people we knew came by then it was a small crowd of her friends. The last 4 people that came were told by the manger that they were \"Inconveniencing the waiters\" because she should made reservations and paid the $500 fee to reserve for 25. 25 people did not show up! The place was not packed and we were paying customers! The fact that we were African American and none of the \"other patrons \" were harassed made it even worse! The food was mediocre and the portions were small. The drinks were ok and the waiters were slow. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  My wife and I went to Baku on a Monday, and had a wonderful experience for our anniversary.  We had a reservation, but it probably wasn't needed on a Monday.  We sat upstairs, enjoyed cocktails, and tried most suggestions with great results!  From start to finish we loved every dish, and they surprised us with champagne and an over the top dessert platter.  Just... Wow!  Yes it is expensive, and yes the wine is overpriced (we passed on expensive recommendations) but cocktails and food were top notch, and worth it!  We will enthusiastically return and can't wait to bring friends."}
{"text":"Just average. Seems to have gone downhill a little bit the last few times we have been. I really wish a great sushi place would open up in Charlotte, we need one badly!"}
{"text":"Great sushi- service struggles a bit. But good sushi is hard to find and the food has never disappointed"}
{"text":"This was the third dinner at Baku and we really enjoyed all aspects. I love the food here and the drinks are well done. I noticed and it is true that this is an expense be place to eat... We tasted and did not over order and our bill was not outrageous.  I always believed that the last thing you want to be cheap is raw fish :)  We will continue to dine here for special occasions. Sorbets were incredible too."}
{"text":"This evening was my 5th time dining at Baku. The last few occasions I have dined here the food and service have been impeccable. Easily Baku has been in my top 5 choices for dinner in Charlotte, especially on special occasions. Tonight was quite a diversion from the norm. Focally there were multiple items not available, Shishito Peppers, several other appetizers, and a few entrees. In the past we had been captivated by the Tomahawk steak and Wagyu beef. Well understanding that the other entrees were \"tapas\" portions, for the money it was a bit meager. One of the six in our party ordered diver scallops, which sets the expectation they should be large. Unfortunately they missed expectations and were small. With all of the absent dishes the flavor of the dishes and service are the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I heard the menu is being updated, but still not a good enough reason for having so many missing dishes. Lastly if it weren't for the aforementioned positives I would have rated tonight a 1 or a 2. I hope these issues are temporary and I look forward to possibly giving it another try soon."}
{"text":"Went with work colleagues and was pleasantly surprised with ambiance matching the food quality. Service was impeccable as were the Lychee Martinis!!  Highly recommend and will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Check this out guys! So i went to baku last week and had amazing time over there with my fiancé because i love the setting first of all. It was kinda cozy and good for a date with your man. secondly, i cant wait to talk about this the food that i got there. It took all my breathe because I'm a food lover and esp. a prawn( big shrimp) lover. Lol i didnt take a picture at the time because it was so good i was rushing thru my plate but i can definitely share the picture from their instagram picture. This is the one im talking about! If you ever feel like wanna get your hand a little dirty(lol) but looking for something delicious, i recommend you go there and try this one!"}
{"text":"So it's been almost a week since I've been to the restaurant and I CANNOT WAIT to go back!!!  It was sooo good! My Friends and I tried the Omaskase Menu! Amazing doesn't even describe how fantastic it was! The flavors of the food are incredible!  So yummy! HUGE Sake List! GREAT atmosphere, loved the décor! Loved the service! Our Server was very friendly. Staff was very attentive. My compliments to the Chefs, you guys are AMAZING!! Impossible to walk away hungry! What a FANTASTIC experience."}
{"text":"I went to Baku and enjoyed everything about my experience. There were three people total in my party and we shared six dishes. We tried the salmon belly sashimi, the calamari, the forbidden roll, the softshell crab roll, the seared blue fin tuna and vegetable tempura. The salmon belly sashimi was the best! The forbidden roll also had amazing flavors and the other dishes were extremely enjoyable. I would come back here over and over again to try out the dishes!"}
{"text":"I had a farewell dinner with my dining buddy, who is moving. Who is going to be game to eat out with me now? *Sigh* Anyhow, Baku was the last hurrah for the time being and it was okay. I arrived later than intended and she was gracious enough to allow me to have her last tiger prawn. These were shrimp sized prawns to say the least and the smallest prawns I've ever eaten. That being said, the sauce that they come in is heavenly and I used it as my condiment for literally Every dish that was served. Want to take great sushi to the next level? Dip it in tiger prawn sauce. Jidori Chicken too bland and far less impressive than a past visit? Dip it in tiger prawn sauce. Brussel sprouts have too many flakes and taste burnt? Dip it in Tiger Prawn sauce. Calamari was great, but you guessed it. I dipped it in tiger prawn sauce as well just because.  Service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu, and even gave us the background on how each food was prepared. Did you know the 20% over pricing at Baku is because they cook with organic charcoal flown from Japan? I cannot make this stuff up. Major polite smirk. The thought of someone labeling charcoal as organic cracks me up. That's where we are as a society.  I'd give a 3.5 if it was an option. Nevertheless, it is not and I'm rounding down because of the chicken and Brussel's sprouts. I'll be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Holy moly! Come hungry...and with a lot of money. Ha! It's expensive, but SO WORTH IT. Charlotte needed a cool establishment like this. Especially for an Asian aficionado like myself, I am always on a lookout for cool Asian food that is perfectly prepared and artistically presented. Think Asian tapas, and remember that they will be small portions. The server recommended that we each order 3 or 4 plates. The plates range from about 10-30. See what I mean about expensive? But one taste of the pork belly, and you'll be emptying your wallet on the table and summoning the waiter for more! Arigato!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, happy hour alone are reasons to frequent Baku, but they are just the tip of the 'berg. My favorite feature is the food presentation. The chefs go out of their way to make every dish seem like a special. Seared Scallops with Foie Gras, Roasted Quail, Toro Tartare, anything Wagyu comes with truffle. Don't get me started on the sushi. Find a reason to eat at Baku !"}
{"text":"Okay. So let me start by saying that I would actually give this place 3.5 stars - pretty good food, great service, small portions and overpriced. But Yelp doesn't give me the option of doing half stars so I'm gonna go with three.   We did girls night here and we each did the restaurant week menu. Now when we sat down, the server said he recommends that everyone get two dishes and it's meant to share. Let me tell you, I'm not sure who is sharing these dishes because the serving size is small. There was a woman next to us who was served her brussel sprouts when I got there. She dramatically said \"oh my goodness! It's so much food! I won't be able to finish this!\" I looked over to see no more than 7 cut up brussel sprouts on her plate. *insert eye roll here* Let me tell you, my girl friends and I all were easily able to eat every item (and we each ordered three separate dishes/courses - no sharing here).   I started with the brussel sprouts and they were wonderful! They had tons of flavor and the texture was amazing. My next course was the dumplings. I loved the flavor and they were crispy on the outside. I also really liked the green onion and peppers on the side that I tossed into the ponzu sauce. For the third course, I had the salmon and, after squeezing the lemon on it, really liked it.   My friend was still hungry and ordered the chocolate cake and said it tasted like a little Debbie cake and wasn't worth the price.   Had this place been more reasonably priced, I would've definitely given it four stars but give the portion size and price point, I think three stars is reasonable."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! Great atmosphere coupled with equally great food. I went sushi/ sashimi and the Dragon rolls. Extremely fresh and some of the best sushi I've ever had. My husband had the lamb chops and loved them. Said they were tender and flavorful with a kick. Must do dining!"}
{"text":"I've visited Charlotte several times and always wanted to try this place. Well, I finally did a couple weeks ago and unfortunately I wasn't impressed. Our group of four ordered:  Rock Shrimp: The sauce served on the side is a little different from what I've had at other places, too much mayo. But anything fried tastes good :-) Wild Mushroom rice pot: Best dish we ordered and the most filling. Get this! Omakase (for 4 people for $20/each): beautifully presented and so fresh, but there's literally one piece for each person. So 4 octopus, 4 salmon, 4 oysters, etc (see pic) Chicken/Onion Yakitori: A little salty, had too many burnt edges. Still good enough to eat. Pea Blossom Maki Roll: 6 small pieces. nothing memorable   While the food was good and the seafood was fresh it just didn't blow me away. At these prices- either increase the portion size, have amazing top notch service, or decrease your prices.  Also, there was a piece of hair weaved into the basket our rock shrimp was served in. We immediately told our server, and he brought out a new batch. However, it would have been nice if he had communicated that dish would be comp'ed bc the whole time we were thinking how bad the service is since most restaurants would comp it. Only later to find out when the bill came they did comp it! But it's pointless when you're in a bad mood throughout the entire meal.   Another minor incident was a dirty sauce dish. Glad we noticed before using it for our sushi!  Maybe it was just an off day...but I just can't justify the food and prices when I can get the same thing in ATL for so much cheaper and better service!  Fyi- the guys were still hungry, so they each ate a bowl of pho afterwards. LOL"}
{"text":"After my initial review last November, the manager of Baku reached out to me and kindly offered to send me a gift card to try the restaurant again. I have been meaning to go back but since I travel a lot I was finally able to have dinner there last night. A few weeks back my parents went with some of their friends and told me they had a wonderful experience! I was excited to give Baku another shot and they definitely have vastly improved since my last visit. The service and food were both great! I will definitely be coming back. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a variety of items but the standouts were the asparagus, the spicy tuna on crispy rice, the lobster & avocado roll, the tiger prawns tempura (not too breaded), and the chirasi. We also loved the chocolate coconut cake - it was delicious! I was also impressed with the drinks - I got the cucumber jalapeño margarita and also tried the strawberry tune. Both were super yummy and innovative. Again, I will say that it is definitely on the pricey side, so be prepared to spend! :)   It definitely goes to show that it is always good to give restaurants a second chance, especially one that is fairly new. I appreciate the manager for reaching out to me and I look forward to my next meal at Baku."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always. Each dish is stunning and delicious.  Our server Chris Smith was perfection, no rush, no annoyance he left us take our time and enjoy a lovely evening. Thank you, Chris. See you soon."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at Baku three times and it is fantastic.  The downstairs is a warm inviting restaurant setting and upstairs is a little more raucous.  So if you like the loud music and more a club feel, go upstairs.  If you prefer a quieter experience, stay downstairs.  As for the food, the menu is very big.  It was a little intimidating the first time and I spent too much time worrying  over what to order.  My advice is each person pick 3 or 4 things and then sit back and relax.  Things will come out as they are ready so delicious surprises show up at your table at a steady pace.  And trust the pairings your chef makes!  One of my favorites was the scallops with foie gras that came with some pickled plum.  Who knew but just a little of that plum with it made it perfect!  Try and be a little adventurous and let your servers help you with suggestions.  They have been spot on.  You can ring up a big tab here.  There are definitely some really pricey items.  But there are also plenty of reasonably priced things as well.    I have no complaints about the wait staff.  They have been courteous, helpful and knowledgeable every time."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not so great being that I live in California. The waygu though is amazing and the waygu nigiri topped with caviar and truffles is my must order."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his 30th birthday. Made our reservation on opentable.com and someone from baku called the next day to confirm the reservation.  We were both highly impressed with the whole experience. We got the \"chefs choice\" dinner, where basically the chef chooses and sends out several courses. everything tasted amazing! Even the beef tartare that I very nervously tried was amazing. My husband said the NY strip grilled over imported japanese charcoal was the best steak he's had in Charlotte (and the man knows steak!) the service and food were impeccable. We will definitely be returning!  I also definitely recommend the hibiscus champagne cocktail!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced! But at least the waitress was really sweet when she asked if we'd be interested in the chef's omakase special...unfortunately we declined at $100 per person!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get why so many people are raging  about this place. Here's my tale of disappointment:  Went here last night since everyone that I knew of was telling me that I gotta try it and that my fellow yelpers said some of the reviews here are just flat out lies. So I came here to accomplish both goals of getting the experience first-hand and write a honest review.   So, back to the story, I came in (had a appointment at 10pm) and I immediately notice the type of people that goes here. Let me tell you, I'm from a pretty well-off family, so I know the difference between wealthy people and snobby ones that doesn't have the money but just act like they do. And I noticed there were ton of those snob. Which is strike one on my list.   Later on at 10:10 pm I was asked to be seated in the back of the room which I'm not fond of since I prefer seating in single seat but oh well. The waiter then gave me a tour through the menu, however, he only went over wines and sake, saying how great their drinks are. I had to ask him about foods, and he wasn't really sure about the sushi when I asked him questions on how fresh it is. Minus another point.  After ordering, the waiter brought out my wine and assuming that I paid nearly $50 that I would get a pretty decent wine (and the waiter even recommended it) I was extremely dissatisfied. I've travel to France and know what good wines are, and let me tell you, the one that Baku serves you are cheap quality wines for extremely ripoff price. You can buy it for 1/3 of the cost!  Now, onto the foods.  Disappointing also... The presentation look good but the taste and quality is a c- on my book. The steak was bleh since it wasn't flavorful (even though they said they are well known with using organic charcoals to make their grill foods delicious).  The duck meats was still kind of raw (goodness gracious) and the plum didn't suit with the duck meat. Their flavors were too different to be combined which made the dish taste unsettling.  Sushi.... Just flat out no. Sushi didn't taste fresh and way too watery. And the sauce that they used did not compliment the sushi, rather it hinders it by creating sour taste.   I don't mind price when it comes to food that are worth it. But when I receive foods that are poorly made, then my friend, I'm quite pissed off. If you want to go here and show off that you have money and claim that it's delicious then go right on ahead. But if you're like me, who actually prefer true culinary skills then this place isn't worth for you to come.   Well, that is the end of my extremely long story of woe. xox"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town. Food is awesome! Try the lamb, best lamb I've had. And that tomahawk 40oz steak is out of this world. Great date place, it's a must-visit place in charlotte"}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé, his friends and their significant others during restaurant week. We pretty much shared the food and got every dish from the menu. The food wasn't really anything special from other Asian restaurants. Service was fine. For a nice restaurant in southpark area I didn't expect the restroom to just be one stall. Probably won't be back. I rather spend close to $100 for 2 people elsewhere"}
{"text":"We make reservations for my birthday party on a Thursday night at Baku. It was really calm on the first floor and I guess it's where older people like to hangout, so we decided to go to the second floor.   We had 2 different rolls, oisters, salmon and a fillet minion and some drinks. Nothing impressive about the food, it was all about small plates very well decor. Our bill was $200+  I did enjoy my birthday, but not enough to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been twice, \"they\" always say try everything twice!  The first time my boyfriend and I sat upstairs totally different vibe (lounge setting) which we loved. We didn't really order a lot of food, we wanted to have a couple of drinks and eat light, so we ordered the snow crab (maki roll) and rock shrimp tempura appetizer.  The appetizer came out first, and it was very good, but I told the waiter it was suppose to come along with the sushi! It took 45 mins for the one sushi roll to come out, but it was amazingly good when we finally got it! They actually gave us an extra appetizer to make up for the mistake, which was very nice! The second time we went in for dinner, we actually was seated downstairs, but moved upstairs because the vibe is better (our opinion.) We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, Baku lobster roll, and the snow crab roll again. The Chilean Sea Bass was a small portion, but well worth it because it was amazing, and both of the rolls were as well! I would definitely recommend giving Baku a try, the service, drinks, and food are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, the portions are really small for the price. The steaks are all over cooked and when we were there it was hot as hell in there! We couldn't enjoy our food, would  probably not go back there for what we spent, not worth the money!!!!"}
{"text":"Good, but overpriced. Not worth the cost considering the quality and quantity per plate. Service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Parking also somewhat of a pain in the small lot. This place just isn't worth the time, trouble, or cash."}
{"text":"The only reason we went to Baku was because our neighbor gave us a gift card there. For some reason I wasn't interested in it, but now I am really glad we got that gift card, because it was a really enjoyable experience.   We sat upstairs in an area that seems like the bar/lounge section, and it was nice. Our server was lights out (baseball reference).  She was on top of everything, extremely friendly and helpful, and all of her suggestions were great.  It was Friday night, so I am guessing she was on their A squad.   The menu has tons of small plate variety, and it seemed like everything we ordered was great.  Chicken meatballs, NY strip tataki, corn, kimchi, pork dumplings, etc.  Our server said they cook the food over some imported hot stones (I only eat off the finest stones)...which I guess is a good thing, because everything tasted great.   For dessert, I highly recommend the truffles.  There are a lot of good things happening in this dessert. The presentation of the food is excessive and awesome (ice everywhere, food floating on various towers, and I think I saw some gold bullion in the background). The actual dessert tastes great, too. The truffles taste like chocolate batter and they come in this almond brittle cup.  There is also this ice cream perched on top of an ice sculpture, which is no slouch either.  We'll definitely be back to Baku in the near future,"}
{"text":"Have come back here a few times since my first visit, and haven't been impressed with the food or ambiance. Loud techno with rushed sushi isn't a great combo in my book.  That said, it still has decent sushi just a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Love the food the service the atmosphere. It's just amazing.  This is great for friends and family I'm impressed by the staff the atmosphere and the food. Get the tomahawk. It's to die for."}
{"text":"This review is only the restaurant service only. The food was kinda pricy and in very small portions, appetizers. I really liked the cozy feel, our waiter was very knowledgeable and kind. The food, flavor, atmosphere was very pleasing, presentation of the food was Excellent. Offering something for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. The restaurant was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was not filling at all, but it was enough to hold us over for a few hours. Loved all the dishes thus far, but be prepared to spend some money.  We would recommend this facility. Im sure everything is a must try!"}
{"text":"It took me three years but I finally found it, a spot that serves good, GREAT, sushi in Charlotte. It's Baku. The sashimi and sea urchin melts in your mouth. Yes, melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for our Anniversary on October 23rd.  It was our first time there and it will definitely not be our last.  The service and food were phenomenal!  Our waiter, Mark, definitely made us feel comfortable and since we had never dined at Baku before, he went over the history and menu with us.  He was very knowledgeable, hospitable, and helpful with our selections.  We decided to order a variety of things to share.  Each of the plates were spaced out perfectly, so as soon as we were done with one plate, a new plate came just minutes later.  It was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Super expensive for what it is and not worth it at all. Please save your money and go elsewhere. I emailed the restaurant numerous times to tell them about my experience and they never contacted me. Terrible customer service."}
