{"text":"This is the place to get wings in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Favorite wing flavor: The Game Changer  Guys are personable, very helpful in helping pick out good wing flavors.  Cory Freeman is the man, if he's working you should definitely get some Black Opts.  And get The Soldier. For the love of God and all of the saints in heaven, get the soldier."}
{"text":"An absolute ton of interesting wing flavors cooked to perfection. Owner is really nice and will explain anything to you and help you navigate the menu. Best wings in Pittsburgh hands down. Make sure you call ahead though because it can take a while to cook but it's worth it. Extremely affordable too!"}
{"text":"I have never had wings as good as these in my life. Total dive bar, you may not even recognize the place is an actual restaurant. However, this is a true place to get Wings. Over 150 flavors, with 50 specialty flavors. They blow away buffalo wild wings, and any other wing joint. I got the Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk, and Mean Joe Green sauces when I went, and I purposely tried to go back on my way home from vacation, but it was too out if the way. Either way, these were some of the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"best wings in Pittsburgh! Talk of beaver falls and black magic never tried any thing  else. Why when you cant stop eating those flavors.Mouth Watering"}
{"text":"Steel City wings are really good, so many flavors, will be back to try some more! Huge selection of flavors and would recommend for bigger gatherings (football games, etc)."}
{"text":"MUST READ!  I just finished a dozen and a half of wings The highlight here is, because of a third party site, Big Shot Bob's didn't receive my payment. I didn't have much cash on me, but when the driver called the owner, the owner let me off the hook for the bill. The funny thing is, he was happy to do it. When I tasted the wings, I knew why. I will be a customer for life.  Great Flavors and Texture Listed in Order of My Favorite 6 Wings- Talk of Beaver Falls (Buffalo type sauce with a sweet flavor) Spicy, but manageable 6 Wings- Blue Magic Dust (Dry rub, delicious) 6 Wings- Pigeon (Parmasean and some other flavor sauce)"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Big Shot Bob's and I am impressed!  We tried the Eye of the Tiger (good), West View Connection (really good and spicy), and the Game Changer (definitely my favorite). Delivery was quick and the wings weren't soggy at all when they arrived.  We also tried the cream cheese poppers which were awesome but didn't come with any sauce to dip in which was disappointing.  Lastly, we had the gyro which was average but good.  My only complaint is that we forgot to order ranch and blue cheese dressing and in my opinion, a wing place should always ask if you want it in case you're like me and forgot to mention it.  Overall really good wings and would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Talk of beaver falls, ace boogie, and game changer are my go to wing flavors. My wife loves the black and yellow. It's not just the wings though. Real steak hoagies (no steak ums) too. Everything we have tried has been excellent. It's not often you can find great wings via delivery. We had an order that was taking longer than expected and the driver brought me a whole bottle of wing sauce. Trust me guys, I'll keep ordering there no matter how long the wait is."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh! Awesome job with the wings and all the other food. I love how crispy and tender the wings are with all the different flavors to choose from. The hoagies are to die for. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the \"Steel City\" flavor of wings. The unique menu always has me coming back. Don't sleep on this place. I have literally tried every hoagie, burger and sandwich on the menu! Wing flavors will take a little longer. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down.. Best wing place in town.. Just the sheer ammount of flavors.. Ive had 10 different ones.. Haven't been disappointed yet.. Too bad they don't have a place to sit and eat in.."}
{"text":"Love their wings especially the Napoleon and Talk of Beaver Falls. If you are a lover of blue cheese, try the Frank Sinatra or Baby Blues!  Also the guys who work here are so friendly and seem to really enjoy being there!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a homey feel and food that brought me to tears. I'm not a wing person. And this place successfully converted me.  The guys there are super nice. Make you feel like you're a regular. Don't be afraid to ask to try the sauces, it helps make the decision easier.  I ordered 6 wings on \"a bed\" (of fries). I was totally unaware they also put the sauce on the fries. Which literally blew my mind.  Order the pookie, you won't be disappointed. Will totally come back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best. Wings. Ever. Please get \"The Most Interesting Flavor\" and try to guess what it is. Wings were delivered in a timely manor and everybody was super friendly. I'm only in town for the weekend but will probably eat here 3 more times."}
{"text":"Best Wings anywhere!  Wish I could find this food in some of the local Taverns!"}
{"text":"Big Shot Bob's House of Wings is a great reason to come and pick up food in Avalon.  They have a great variety of wings.  Too many to mention. We ordered 6 types including \"The most interesting flavor\" and they were awesome. Talking with the owner you can tell he wants you to have the best wings you have ever tasted. He doesn't disappoint.  We ordered too many, but ate them over the next 3 days.   I can't say enough good things about the quality and care that went into my order.  We will be back for more."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on a recommendation and it was just below ok. I ordered 6 Ain't My Faulk wings, 6 Pigeon Wings, and loaded bacon, ranch and cheese fries. The wings were a good size but not seasoned well, as in one side was unseasoned and the other had a ton of season. Spreading out the seasoning may have changed my experience. The fries were good, really good, but absurdly massive. It was big enough for 4 people, atleast."}
{"text":"First time ordering after a friend recommended them, and was glad to find out that they deliver to West View. Decided to order two dozen wings including Lady Luck (buffalo with ranch seasoning) and Pigeon wings on a bed of fries.  Wings were a nice size and came with a LOT of sauce, which is not a bad thing. As is the case with any delivery or takeout wings, they didn't arrive very crispy. Not much you can do about that.  Lady Luck were particularly good as the buffalo sauce was very good. Look forward to trying some other flavors."}
{"text":"Best wings in the 412, and that's not just a saying, it's hands down the best and no one comes close as far as taste or selection. They have over 120 flavors from \"Pigeon Wings\"to the \"The Franki Valli\"( served on a bed of hand cut fries), they are always crisp and fresh and wrapped in plastic wrap so they don't spill everywhere in your car. The hoagies are filled with tons of meat and toppings. So if you want wings, BSB is the only choice if your in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Today was an exciting day folks.. we ordered lunch from Big Shot Bobs.  It was hard to decide with - what 100 flavors on the menu!  Of course I did my research on yelp and read up on some reviews and I took my top five and just picked two at random to try.      \"Talk of Beaver Falls\" - Hot and Tangy.  This blend was definitely my favorite..raise the roof!   Its true to the name and flavor was very original ..  go ahead Big Shot Bobs.   These are NOT for sharing that's for sure and I am not sorry.   I loved to dip my french fries in the left over sauce.  I will never forget those wings.   \"William Henry Harrison\" - Jamaican Jerk and Parmesan Cheese.   Very interesting and flavorful however - the wings were in at least an inch of sauce and most of it was butter.    and I also tried \" Black Frank White\"  Franks Red Hot and Ranch and Black Magic Seasoning.    I was quite intriqued to find out what this seasoning was all about since its peppered throughout the menu.  I think it's a blend of seasoned salt and maybe two other spices.  Definitely interesting and tasty.  The are a dry rub and the franks red hot and ranch combination.. is what ...a match made in heaven of course.   The bed of fries were interesting .. the wings are served on top of the fries. What a fun and clever idea!  After learning that  a plain side of fries is just \"meh\".   I love my wings crispy and well done and this is how the wings are delivered..  horray   There is more to the menu than just wings.. salads and sandwiches and when was the last time you saw \"Sloppy Joe's\" on a menu!!  Love it.     I am no doubt very impressed.... Thanks Big Shot Bobs!!!"}
{"text":"Holy. Chicken. Wings. These chicken wings are THE best wings I have ever had.  There are times I have a hard time talking hubby into something he hasn't tried before unless A-he discovered it himself or B-he gets tired of my incessant nagging to try someplace new. For once, Big Shot Bob's was not either of these cases.  We did a delivery order. Ordered the Steel City (ranch, mild buffalo, parmesan cheese), lemon pepper and garlic butter parm. All three were tasty, seasoned right and (my favorite!) crunchy. I prefer wings that are not breaded, and that have an extreme crunch to them, and Bob's does it just right.   We also ordered a pepper steak hoagie and an order of fries with ranch, cheese and bacon. The fries were phenomenal and totally appealed to my junk food side. I felt guilty putting the leftovers next to my lettuce in the fridge.  Anywho, the delivery took less than the projected time, the guy who took my order was super nice and gave me a (verbal) pat on the back for ordering the Steel City wings, and there wasn't one complaint from any of us regarding the food. We will definitely order from there again. All the great Yelp reviews were such a big factor in the decision to order from there."}
{"text":"Great wings in more favors than imaginable. Buffalo Blues in Shadyside was always my favorite, but these wings have far surpassed.   Top five favors, in my humble opinion, are: Black and Mild Uncle Nicks Talk of Beaver Falls Black Magic Cajun Wet  The only favors that I didn't care for we're the Napoleon ones. The sauce just didn't do it for me.   Hoagies and Burgers are also good. They have fresh cut fries on rare occasion. Wish that was an all time thing as the balance of their sides don't do much for me."}
{"text":"Our family loves to try wings from places all around the Pittsburgh area, and this place has the best wings, hands down.   1.  Crispy on the outside, but with tender chicken in the inside. 2.  Every flavor of wing you can think of, and many you'd never imagine. 3.  Friendly service. 4.  Not cheap! They have a new location in Coraopolis near the Neville Island bridge."}
{"text":"This time I tried the Big Shot Burger.  (see photo)  A 1/2 burger topped with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, mustard, ketchup, mushrooms, bacon, American cheese and a onion ring. It was freakin' EPIC! For $5.99 it's a hell of a bargain!  I also love the fact that they deliver to my job! FTW!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for wings so I Googled and found this place. The name was pretty impressive so I went for it. They have sooo many flavors to choose from its insane. I order the sweet honey bbq and Mr. C's. The sweet honey bbq was very sweet and the wings are very meaty! Mr. C's is a different flavor that comes with parm and some type of black magic dust (which sounded scary when I read it the 1st time). The best way I could describe it would be very different lol. Honey BBQ 1-5=4. Mr.C's 1-5=3."}
{"text":"found this place on yelp, turns out its only a few mins from my house. got the talk of beaverfalls and honey bbq.  def my favorite place for wings. the guys are super friendly there and explained all the flavors i had questions about. would recommend to anyone  in pittsburgh or visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I have to admit I am surprised to see that Big Shot Bobs has such good ratings! The food is ok, but just ok. One should note that we have only ever ordered for delivery, and have never dined in.   My husband and I have tried a bit of everything. The wings are bleh. The Philly Cheese Stake is amazing! The loaded French fries are good. We tried a burger that was ok, but over cooked.   Do not order in if you are hungry, as delivery normally takes an hour. In fact, last week, we ordered gyros and were told our food would arrive in 60 minutes. Two hours later (yes, double the time we were told), we received our gyros... cold gyros.   Several months ago, I swore to never order from Big Shot Bobs again after my first experience calling for delivery. I was never so rudely spoken to, and it was a turn off from the place as a whole. I would like to think that whomever was taking orders that night was just having a rough day and not always speaking to customers in that manner. BUT, since we have our food delivered, I suppose customer service is not very pertinent. I quickly got over my anger towards the place as a whole and the rude fellow on the opposite end of the phone.   My husband and I will probably continue to order from Big Shot Bobs from time to time, as they offer a nice variety of food (bar/sandwich food)."}
{"text":"Actually discovered this place on yelp even though I've driven past it millions of times. The reviews were all good and the pictures looked great so we went for it. We ordered the big shot burger, a plain cheeseburger, and 13 wings in the 3 rivers sauce on a bed of fries. Everything was really good although everything was also overdone (had it not been I think I'd be giving 5 stars) Now I like honey mustard, ranch, and bbq but I was skeptical as to how good that would taste all together. Boy was I wrong. It was delicious and the bed of fries under it is clutch!!! The wings are a bit expensive but I'll definitely be ordering them again if for no other reason than there are still 149 more wing flavors to try."}
{"text":"So after a few months in the burgh and seeing big shot bobs get good ratings I finally decided to make the drive and give em a try. I went in a little overwhelmed by the 200 flavors of wings to choose from so I took the easy way out and got the most popular.  Talk of beaver falls, I don't know where beaver falls is bt they have good wings. It was a kind of hot honey mustard taste that I was surprised I liked because I hate honey mustard. These were different tho.   The thing that stood out the most to me was the service u recieved. Knowing I was new to the spot they gave me about 10 wings free in my bag just for me to try and see what I liked.the wings they included were the jumping jimmys. Which is basically hot wings and ranch mixed together. It was my favorite. They also included black magic which seemed to be seasoned with old bay. Interesting but still tasty. Being from the south hospitality trumps everything. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I get wings from here a lot and they're usually on point, that's why the three stars, but recently it hasn't have been as good. I ordered today and they forgot both orders of fries that I ordered and the wings were underdone, I even asked for light sauce on the wings and fries and of course didn't get that either. For the price, it's a shame they couldn't do it right. The owner is great and I used to order from there constantly, but I won't be doing that again."}
{"text":"Huge selection... my favs are tereyaki and Cajun.... give it a shot."}
{"text":"Tried Big Shot Bob's for the first time (Coraopolis Location)...Nice People,Great Food......  ---Buffalo Mild Wings-- Good Mild Sauce, Not overly hot as some places make their mild sauces....If we wanted hot,we'd order hot...I don't need somebody to try and be a hero and make the mild sauce too spicy for those without a love for hot foods.....That being said, that is my wife,not me...She loved these...I like the hot stuff!  ---Talk of Beaver Falls Wings-- Excellent...Sweet hot with Fresh Black Pepper....As described...I liked these!  ---Mushroom Steak Hoagie--- I'm always skeptical of Steak Hoagies that I am trying for the first time...Too many crappy ones out there....Bob's does not disappoint!! Mushrooms have a slight buttery taste (like they are sauteed in butter on the grill)...They cook the hoagie in the foil, which gives a nice, soft bun...I ordered banana pepper rings on mine,too, but they only had a few left, but they put on what they had left, and it was good!  -- Bacon Cheddar Ranch Tots-- First time I've seen this done with tater tots...actually one of the first times I've actually seen tater tots on a menu! I wanted to try the Fries, but wife wanted to try the Tots...and they were good...a huge helping also!  All the wings are cooked crispy, according to one of the owners that I talked to when I ordered, and that is the truth! Nothing worse than a rubbery wing..They traveled well,too...since they are cooked crisp, they don't get soft and rubbery on the trip home. I'll order from Bob's Again!"}
{"text":"great food reviews www.bigtsreviews.com"}
{"text":"Big Shot Bob's is a dominant wing shop.  It's a small hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere next to a gas station that has no seating so it's all pickup/delivery.  Something like 150 different flavors, and the wings aren't breaded so they have that nice crispy shell on the outside.  I tried the honey garlic, BIGFINEWOMAN2000, and the garlic butter parm (my favorite of the 3).  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time at Big Shot Bobs. Great part # 1. Person on the phone was actually happy to take my order than most places. When I got there person at counter was equally enthusiastic. I liked the wings and the steak hoagie was good too. Will be trying more flavors soon."}
{"text":"Been here many times just got back and tried 3 new to us flavors Mr Northside, Pookie, and Frank Sinatra all very good. But the best by far is the Game-Changer followed by Pigeon Wings. In fact of the 20+ flavors so far we have had the only one I would not get again is Hottest of the Hot which was too hot for me.  Oh and you got to put it on a Bed of Fries the extra sauce makes them the best not the healthiest food but what wings are."}
{"text":"I am not embarrassed to admit that I eat Big Shot Bob's wings some times twice a week.  My fav are the old bay wet.  Which is old bay seasoning and butter. Best words to discribe this place finger licking good. They have a special here, I thinks it 6 orders of wings and a 2 liter for 21.00, or something like that. The lemon pepper parm or a second favorite. Lemon juice, peppercorn and parmesan.  The flavor combinations are very creative, and orginal. They have flavor combinations that I would never have even thought. The jerk wings are good too.  The food as always delieverd on time. They normally set an expecation of 1 hour deliever. I haven't had any bad experience with them coming later than that."}
{"text":"I would marry Big Shot Bob if he would have me.  His employees are always helpful when I have questions about all their wing flavors.  The portions are generous.  The prices are right.  The food is always a treat.  I've had several different wing flavors, some of the sandwiches including the sloppy joe, grilled cheese and BLT and I've never been disappointed.  Also, they have tater tots!!  If my heart and stomach would let me, I would probably eat here more often.  I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need a specialist. Or at least a business with a specialty. You will find that at Bob's. They mostly do wings, and they do them well.  Their very first sauce they sold was \"The Talk of Beaver Falls.\" It's still their best seller, and for good reason. But Black Magic is a contender, especially if you like spicy.   If you like perennial favorites, try the Garlic Parm.  Bob's does mostly takeout and delivery.  Their store is small, and it can get hot inside with all the ovens. But their service is friendly and quick.   I was surprised that each location has a different owner. So maybe Bob's is a franchise?  The wings are meaty,  substantial and filling. There are plenty of flavors to please any palate. That makes this place a winner!"}
{"text":"Great wings! We've gotten them a few times when friends are coming over to hang out. Everyone loves trying to pick from their massive list of flavors. We haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Truly a hole in the wall place for wings. They have 150 different flavors of wings you can get and the prices are pretty good. Flavor is excellent and this is the perfect place to go if you have large party or catering needs for Football Sunday among other needs. Recommend the Talk of Beaver Falls flavor."}
{"text":"We tried Big Shot Bob's for a recent party, ordered 50 wings to-go. Everyone raved that these were some of the best wings they've ever had. We ordered their BBQ/Honey Mustard sauce and their dry rubbed. Both flavors were a hit! The thing that really surprised me was despite spending some time wrapped in foil the wings stayed super crispy, a huge plus. After trying 2 of their 150 wing flavors I now have 148 reasons to go back."}
{"text":"The best wings in the burgh its so good it'll make you slap your momma....*smack* ITS SO DELICIOUS MA..  I wish they had more locations tho"}
{"text":"Very excited to visit here...wing sauces sounded amazing. Wings over cooked, sauces averages and location average, I like there creativity but execution was lacking."}
{"text":"WOW i mean WOW! Not only are the wings good but the hoagies, salad and apps are fantastic! Service is great.  I don't like the cash only,  so many times we can't order cause we don't have cash"}
{"text":"In one word I describe this wing/food joint is great... we always order wings and hoagies... a little pricy but it's all worth it... hoagies only come in whole...NO HALF... cash only... NO CARD NO ATM...   I usually get Black magic dust its awesome    wife gets Three rivers, and the daughter loves the Prime time... the wings are mostly always crispy and very very flavorful."}
{"text":"Wings, they way they should be. Crispy outside, moist inside, with tasty sauce.  Good people and good food. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"This is by far the best wing place ever!! We get wings just about every Friday for lunch (only because it's the only day they are open for lunch) and I have yet to be disappointed. Who would have thought a wing place named after Robert Horry  in Pittsburgh would be this good!"}
{"text":"Had these wings years ago and they were bomb.  Had them again today, and they were still amazing!  Talk of Beaver Falls is by far my favorite sauce.  Will absolutely be coming back now that I live in this area again!"}
{"text":"We just got wings for takeout tonight from Big Shot Bob's. I ordered the medium buffalo and the hubs got spicy bbq. We also got an order of fries.  First thing... these wings are HUGE! So many places have these tiny little wings but not here. There's a ton of meat on them and they are cooked well.  The sauces are really good too. Spicy bbq is really spicy so be warned. The medium buffalo has just the right kick.  I thought the fries were good but the hubs likes his fries a bit crispy so he wasn't a fan. The wings could be a bit more crispy but the flavors were awesome so it made up for it.  This was our first try here and I'm going to agree with most posts that these make a run for the best wings in The 'Burgh.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed because I have eaten at other locations several times. I live in observatory hill which is about a 7 minute drive from this location. We are both on the north side. I call into place an order for delivery. The person on the phone says \"it might be a little hard to get to you because we are short staffed during the week but possibly on the weekends\". And then a pause. I say, so to clarify your not going to deliver to my house because I'm not sure what your saying it's kind of a yes or no thing. And he says \"probably not\" this is unacceptable. For one, just say yes or no we don't deliver to your address, but for two, it's puzzling that there are so many different locations on each side of town, INCLUDING mine, and I can't get a delivery. I will not attempt to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every single wing sauce you could ever be craving, and. . . They deliver! The wings were still crispy and hot when they got to my door. It was a bit of a wait for delivery, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Yes it's pricey, but they're the best wings I've ever had hands down. The Steel City are my favorite. Also the tots are great. The crispiness of their food is perfect - never undercooked. Gotta try them out!"}
{"text":"If you knock back a \"Big Shot\" before you drive here, you're likely to end up with a DUI and no driver's license. Even a \"Little Shot\" of something delicious like Bailey's, is a bad idea. I recommend \"No Shot\" at all, despite the misleading and troublemaking business name which is counter-productive as it leads to many customers ending up in State Pen. I'd rather be in Penn State than State Pen. Although it's a close contest.  What to get: Wings (Old Bay - Wet)  Just as good as the ones at the other location I've been to (further North in Coraopolis), these are simply the best wings I've ever had outside of Buffalo (the home of wings, and rightly so). In fact, were they in Buffalo, they'd be one of the best wing spots there too, believe it or not. They're not just the best in Pitt.. they're some of the best anywhere. I've yet to try the 3rd location (Carnegie) but based on the first two (Coraopolis and now Avalon), it's likely to be just as perfect.  I highly recommend you get the Old Bay, Wet. Which means they are dripping in butter (shush, if you're eating wings you're not eating healthy anyway so get over it and let your heart worry about it), and seasoned to perfection with dark delicious maroon-crimson-reddish Old Bay seasoning. Every wing will rock your world, and you'll wish you had ordered more.  Speaking of which, I love that they'll make you just 5 wings (for 6 or so dollars) instead of making you order a full 10 (like most wing places in Buffalo do). If Old Bay isn't your thing, they have, ooh, about 50 other combinations for you to choose from. Take it from this connoisseur... these are some of the best wings you'll ever eat.  So when your friends say \"where are the best wings in town?\" and some fool offers up suggestions such as Hooters or BW3 (eww), then learn from that Richard Dreyfus movie and scream out \"WHAT ABOUT BOB'S?\" And forget Bobbing for Apples. From now on, when we Bob, we Bob at Bob's for Wings. End of."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write. Most of the times BSBs is 5 stars, then there are those off days when it's 2 stars. Tonight was a 2 star night. Soggy tots. Super salty wings. Wings that should be \"VERY HOT\" that are moderately hot. $2 charge for using s debit card. Just generally disappointing. BUT usually they're fantastic."}
{"text":"Always great. The guys are friendly at this place. Don't let the laundry mat & gas station nearby sway you. They do everything really well here."}
{"text":"Have only gotten wings once because they're a tad pricy for me. The soldier sandwich is excellent though. Never disappoints in taste or filling me up. Not the most personable guys in the world..."}
{"text":"listen I dont write reviews;however, this is the best wing spot in the burgh hands down #williamhenryharrison. plus they got a picture of big l on the wall .  thats love"}
{"text":"Have to say they have good wings depending on the sauce!!!  But the problem we found was that they make these wings pretty well but they give you ranch and blue cheese on the side that come straight out of a cheap bottle from the dollar store!!!! Why???? How hard is it to come up with a great salad dressing To go with the wings or even their salads???? It completely ruins the taste of the wings and salad!!!   We have heard this from a lot of people who say they stopped ordering simply for that reason!!!! I hope they take this seriously and reconsider making and effort to improve this or we will also stop ordering!!!  I will definitely ask when ordering if they still use the bottled salad dressing!!! Yuk!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dude; no better wings in the city! Don't be over-whelmed by all of the flavor options, just pick a few, they'll be great."}
{"text":"Delicious wings. All of the locations are great. A little pricey but you're guaranteed good, crispy wings. A ton of flavors that you will always come back to try more."}
{"text":"I've been ramping up on spicy food lately, and as tends to come with the territory, I've been eating a lot more wings. Problem: most places have mediocre wings at best, and the \"Hottest\" wings at most places is just franks red hot red vinegar. Solution: Big Shot Bobs.   It popped up on my phone, and I called them to order whatever their hottest wing was. Their flavors list is about half the length of \"infinite jest\", so I thought it best to just ask. I called the location, and was greeted by a grunt. I asked if I had the right place, and the gentlemen said yes, sounding annoyed. I asked for the hottest wing, he asked if I was sure, and I said yeah. He told me the total, and off I went.   I showed up at the place, practically a closet, and waited patiently for my order. The place is barely noticeable on the side of the road, and is downright ugly. He walked the order to my car- which was nice- and I asked what flavor the wings were, exactly. He replied \"I just threw all the hottest shit we got on 'em.' I said thanks, and ran home to try them.  They're the best wings I've ever had. Don't let the place fall under your radar, especially if you like spicy food or wings."}
{"text":"We were really excited to order wings from this place and watch our favorite TV show tonight however we were told \"Sorry pick up only tonight brotha\". Don't offer something you don't intend to provide. Why would you ever refuse business?"}
{"text":"Wings are delicious!!!! Have tried 10 different flavors out of 150. Love the special 5 orders of 6 wings for about $23. Not bad at all. Wings are nice sized and flavorful. Love eye of the tiger, three Rivers, and big fine woman 2k. Best wings in Pittsburgh so far. Excited to try new flavors. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Making a mission to try every flavor. I've yet to be let down by the quality of their wings. Typically spicy wings do not overwhelm me, but I'll tell ya, there's some on their menu that deserve to be called hot. That is great to me. They also have many other delicious flavors. If you've never been here and enjoy wings, make it your next destination. Staff is also very cool. Ask their suggestions."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh! Never had a flavor I didn't like. Try the \"Black Frank White.\" They're not on the menu yet but are awesome! The guys who work there are all cool too"}
{"text":"Wings are great! Recommend the Magic man, it is ordered every time. The hoagies are really good. The buffalo chicken salad is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Still awesome. Sadly they were apparently closed Memorial Day weekend, and I couldn't introduce my husband to the awesome wings.  More flavors? General Tso's - 1/5 - meh. Not very General-Tso's-y at all, sadly; more like BBQ sauce and some other stuff. Might have been good if I hadn't been fiending for stereotypical American-Chinese and decided to go with wings instead.  Old Bay with Butter - 5/5 - I always ask for these, and they always make them for me. These may possibly be better than what I remember eating at Gooski's six years ago. All the butter is at the bottom, so they stay nice and crispy until I'm ready to eat them.  Blue Magic - 3.5/5 - It should be noted that I really don't like oregano, but I decided to give these a try anyway. If it weren't for the oregano, they'd be amazing, so YMMV if you don't think oregano is the devil's herb. The blue cheese is definitely good, and the rest of the Black Magic provides a really interesting complement.  I'm still a faithful wing-ordering customer, and their phone and delivery service is still awesome. Their lunch specials are great, if you happen to be home when they're on offer."}
{"text":"Wings were delicious! We had the black magic, pigeon and the talk of beaver falls. The talk of beaver falls were a bit to spicy for my husband and I. We also got a solider sub. The gyro meat was a bit funky to me. It wasn't my cup of tea but it wasn't bad.  The place in avalon is a hole in the wall. The place could use a bit sprucing up.  Definitely will go back for more wings.  A deducted a star for the condition of the place and the 1.00 i got charged for my order of 50 bucks just because i used a credit card. Felt they could cover the credit card fees."}
{"text":"I stopped by here recently with my wife and father in law for dinner.  We have been to big shot bobs many times now and for some reason I have yet to write a review.  This big shot bobs is the original one and was started in 2007.  It fits the \"hole in a wall\" description very well as this location is take out/delivery only and has space for maybe 3 people in front of the counter.  It is decorated quite interestingly with random posters along the wall and a number of Pirates bobblehead boxes near the cash register.  On this occasion whenever I called in I was quoted 30 minutes before they were ready and we arrived shortly around that time to find our order already finished.  I think that I spent a total of 3 minutes inside this establishment before heading home with our food.  For dinner on this evening I decided to go with 6 Walk of Beaver Falls wings on a bed of fries.  Yes you can do that and the fries are tossed with the wing sauce too!  If you look at the menu you will see the Walk of Beaver Falls described as the Talk of Beaver Falls only hotter.  Then if you look at the Talk of Beaver Falls you will see that it is hot and tangy.  A lot of the Wing sauces on the menu are the same way with some that you have to look at 4 different flavors before you find out what it is.  While this annoys me at times it may very well be the only thing that annoys me about Big Shot Bob's.  Their wings are absolutely delicious and this time was no exception.  They are always on the larger side for wings and are juicy and fried perfectly.  Big Shot Bobs wing sauces are also always good and they certainly have enough of them.  My Walk of Beaver Falls ended up reminding me of the Louisiana Lickers sauce from Quaker State only a lot hotter, exactly as described.  It thoroughly coated both the wings and the fries which was awesome since I loved the flavor.  The only downfall to getting the fries coated in the sauce is that they tend to get a little bit soggy.  However I would rather have my Big Shot Bob's fries coated in sauce and a little bit soggy than crispy without any sauce.  By the end of my meal my mouth was on fire and I was pleasantly full.  The bottom line for me is that I will continue to head here again in the future.  Big Shot Bobs has what I would consider to be the best wings in Pittsburgh so if you haven't had them before you should get there and try them."}
{"text":"The wings were great. Why? Crispy and a fair sized wing. I tend to stay with Buffalo style med to hot range. The sauce was plenty but not greasy. I was with 2 other folks and they got a barbeque style and lousiana style. We all tried each others and felt all were very tasty and worth the drive. We also got some of the french fries speckled with black and gold seasoning, i think a reference was made to Steelers fries, they were good as well. The bad. the place in avalon is to go only."}
{"text":"Wing lovers rejoice! Not only are BSB's wings huge, but you could really never tire of their multitude of strange sauces. And, they deliver! Praise the wing Gods.   Having to admit that the delivery guy knows me, and my dog on a personal level is kinda embarrassing, but once you eat from here, you'll know why I love it.   My go to is either \"Eye of The Tiger\", a sweet, peppery medium sauce, or \"Pigeon Sauce\" a nice, easy mild sauce with parmesan cheese.  I've tried some of their other sauces, but these two are perfection on a wing.   I've gotten their Steak hoagie, and Italian hoagie, both are great, but they're called a \"House of Wings\" for a reason. You can't beat their wing and hoagie special, though, if you're trying to feed a few friends!   Don't plan on stopping in here and chowing down, they barely have enough room for themselves to cook, let alone you to come in and eat! Just call them and let their amazing delivery team take care of you, and tip them well.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Wings are the bomb! My son and I love the flavors. Over 100... Black and mild are excellent.  Family loves the dry ranch rub. Super crispy wings. Will try using them for parties with the 50 wing tray! Yum!"}
{"text":"The guys that run this place deserve 5 stars, they rock. I am removing one because my order was incomplete and i did not realize till I drove back to McCandless.  Bummer..... One to the wing, they were big and yummy! I got the newOrleans flavor and really liked the spice and kick, The blue cheese dressing was good but next time I will pick ranch. All in all we will be back."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh just hasn't been that great to me for the year or so I've been here. Unless you are willing to visit the Strip and the like, you are stuck with pizza and perogies . . .   So Big Shot Bob's is one of Pittsburgh's outstanding local dives / deliveries.  There is almost nothing to criticize here and nearly everything to praise.   First and foremost, they simply have the best wing I've ever had from a resturant. Bar none. I haven't tried every wing listed, I hope I only live once, but all the flavors which sounded good, ended up being great.  You might have wait longer than you wish, till you become a regular (more later), but it is well worth it. The wings are large, juicy, and very well flavored.  If you become a regular, they treat you like a king. You'll get expedited delivery. \"Free\" add ons. Test flavors. And just the sure sense you are a valued customer.   WIthout a single bit of hesistation I highly recommend Big Shot Bob's. Unbeatable."}
{"text":"The best wings in Pittsburgh.  Ever.  Worth every penny.  Sauces are excellent.  I have a few favorites like Mr. Northside.  Their fries are so good, and sandwiches, too!!  Everyone who works there is awesome to deal with, they give great recommendations.  and they deliver!!  Cash only."}
{"text":"So good! We got 39 wings and tried 3 different sauces. With the help of the owner Matt we had 3 very different sauces to fit our families preferences. We also ordered a side salad. It was better than most sit down restaurants!  It had fresh red peppers, sliced cucumbers, red cherry tomatoes, shredded cheese and a lovely spring mix of greens. We also order the bacon cheese fries that we're out of this world! Thank you Matt for a fabulous dinner after soccer. I wish you all the best!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings.  Black OPS are always a crowd pleaser. Try some of the dry and wet, all are good"}
{"text":"Most amazing flavor choices ever. Best wings in Pittsburgh. Black and Gold and Mean Joe Green are our favorite flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am addicted to the Mr. Northside. The guys are very nice there too! And they take good care of their customers. My fave wing spot!"}
{"text":"You can not go wrong with Big Shot Bob's. So many different flavors of wings, Calfornia Love my new favorite . Matt always treats me like a VIP"}
{"text":"Black Magic wings are the best ever! Try Black & yellow & black & gold!  Not hot, but delicious! Gyros are a hit too!  Super friendly service if you walk in, take-out, or delivery!"}
{"text":"It's tough work narrowing 150+ flavors down to 2.  After hearing and reading so many good things about Big Shot Bob's I thought it was past time to give their wings a try.  Two of my friends and I fired up the internet and accessed their menu.  Over one hundred and fifty flavors?!  Say what?!  We read through all of the flavors and kept notes of the ones we wanted to try.  We then voted for our 5 favorites thinking since we were ordering 50 that we'd be able to get multiple flavors.  Wrong.  Two, two flavors for an order of 50.  That's unfortunate.  So we ended up with \"The Talk of Beaver Falls\" and their version of Louisiana Lickers.  Both sauces did not disappoint.  Spicy, sweet, complex, and not overpowering.  The wings themselves were big, meaty, juicy, and crisp.  Even with our big appetites left a lot still in the stryofoam containers.    Now, these were the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh and with so many choices makes them a strong contender for best in the 'Burgh.  BUT I have some gripes that docked a star.  They are expensive, but you pay for quality and I think it's still a fair price.  I didn't feel too good the next day so it may have been the oil being over used I am not sure, but this is usually the case.  And making people only able to pick 2 flavors for an order of 50 is a little crazy.    All that said Big Shot Bob's will get my business again."}
{"text":"I see why this place gets 5 stars. All the wing flavors here taste great and I love that each wing is packed full of flavor. The guys behind the counter is pretty cool to talk to."}
{"text":"These wings are by far the best I've ever had.  After reading other reviews here, I decided to try the Old Bay dry, and I'm so glad I did! They're crunchy, not greasy, and although the Old Bay is a little heavy handed, it's not overly spicy in a painful way. I'm eager to try the wet wings as well, just to see if those also stay crunchy and not greasy.  Fries are also awesome. I hate regular french fries, and was really hoping that their plain fries wouldn't disappoint. They haven't.   It's been a while since I ordered wings out -- and I only found Big Shot Bob's because I was Googling for wing shops that delivered near Bellevue -- so I don't know what pricing tends to go, but the price for these didn't seem unreasonable. Yes, delivery took 45 minutes -- but they arrived fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Everything is made to order! So appreciate that. I ordered wings with the black magic flavor, garlic, and cheese (forgot the name) super tasty. Fries were separate but came in a large amount. Only down side was dipping sauces were an up charge. I only had wings and fries so i can't give it 5 stars, but definitely worth trying! Great guys working there too!"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER. They have over 100 delicious, blissful flavors. I can't believe we didn't know about this place until now. It is the holy grail of wings. Hot, crunchy, and oh so saucy.  As others have said, Old Bay Wet is incredible. We also did Black and Yellow (good but not great). Medium did not disappoint. Next time we will try the employee's suggestion of Cajun Parm.  Fries are amazing. We had the ranch cheese (I skipped the bacon) variety. Crispy delicious fries coated in thick mozzarella cheese. They were heaven.  The right price -- we even got the 3 for $13 to sweeten the deal Super awesome and friendly employees  Note: You cannot sit down and eat to BSBHW. We made this mistake. Last weekend."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!!!!  This was our first time ordering from Bobs. We ordered 6 orders of 1/2 dozen different flavors. We asked for them to be cooked \"well done\" because we like our wings a little crispy, every order of our wings were cooked to perfection! The 6 flavors we ordered were: 3 rivers---our absolute favorite flavor!!!, Hottest of the Hot-I love super super hot wings and these did not disappoint!, Frank Sinatra-delicious flavor combination!, Jamaican Frank-these were good but not as good as the other flavors and the Beaver Falls which they said is their most popular/best seller...while they were good I wouldn't order them again, we thought they had a \"different\" flavor and were not something worthy of a repeat order. There are over 150 flavors and we cannot wait to try them all, but I do know we will always order the 3 Rivers because the flavor was memorable and addicting!!! We are now huge Big Shot Bob fans!!!"}
{"text":"Best junky fatty food I've ever had. When I'm feeling fat and gross I eat here lol. Their chicken Philly and fries are to die for"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I found this place after I yelped restaurants near me (Brighton Heights) and found next to nothing except Big Shot Bob's!!! I have ordered multiple times and have found the wings amazing each time. The only issue I have experienced is the cooking time and delivery are both a bit longer than your average corporate place. So I just factor that into my dinner plans, but expect longer times during Steelers games etc. But they are worth the wait. I love trying all the different flavors. I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but I will put their wings up against anybody."}
{"text":"Really tasty sauces, decent sized wings, and friendly staff!"}
