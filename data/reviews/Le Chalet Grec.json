{"text":"Great food and fast service. Make sure to bring your wine. You might expect some line ups."}
{"text":"When I saw the 4.5 star rating, I was excited! But food was average and service a bit slow. They don't even serve pita bread with the taziki sauce.  Great place to bring the kids. Pretty packed for a Friday night. Rating is more realistic at a 3 star."}
{"text":"Real Greek Spoon!  The staff is super friendly and the restaurant offers a cozy atmosphere.  Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great dinner. We were referred by a friend to try something different. We don't frequent Greek restaurants usually.  We started with escargot & calamari. The calamari was delicious & tender. Escargot was good with plenty of garlic butter and cheese.  I ordered the double souvlaki plate and I cleaned my plate. Perfect in every aspect, taste, portion and overall value.  We will return when we visit again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Le Chalet Crec probably about 4 or 5 times over the years. Whenever I'm in Saint-Sauveur with my Canadian relatives we always eat here. It's BYOB, so definitely bring your own wine.   The service is friendly, the portions are very generous, and the food is extremely delicious. We always start with tzatziki and taramasalata. For entrees in the past I've ordered the sole, the dore, and the mixed grill.   My visits have spanned over quite a few years so I don't remember the earliest visits as well, but most recently I was there in August and it was as good as I remembered. If you're in Saint-Sauveur, look no further than Le Chalet Grec for a tasty meal and great service."}
