{"text":"We had eaten across the street so we walked in to see what this place was about.    It's a natural foods store with a lunch counter (vegetarian) and a few tables in the front. The place is really nice  - take a moment if you're in there to admire the floors, the walls, the insane back patio. Well, that's the best of my review, here comes the rest. It's very fancy for a natural foods store.   VERY fancy.     You're next door to the senior's home and across the street from Le Cheese food truck and a dry cleaner.   You don't exactly blend.   LOL The products on the shelves were insanely overpriced. I went looking for some vital wheat gluten - I get it for $8.99 at my  fruit/veg store in Cote St Luc, it was $13.99 at this store for the same product from the same brand.    That's a huge price difference that I won't pay. Good luck with the business, but I'll drive two minutes to get the same products at a huge discount."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the most exciting restaurants I've been to, in Montreal. It opened, I believe, in September.  It's tiny, or intimate, with one communal table and two bar stools. There is a wall of foods and condiments for sale.  The vegan organic food is quite memorable: the pizza with vegetable crust piled high with roasted vegetables was sensational - every bite.  I only tried a sample of the beet/Apple salad, which was also delicious.  Even th coffee was exceptional. The prices aren't cheap - this is Montreal, with all the tax surcharges, and it's also vegan, using the highest quality ingredients.  I went there twic in one day. What does that tell you?  :). Vivian introduced me, took me here for a birthday lunch, then I went back later with my mother,Mohsen she said she was hungry, and needed a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Really over priced and did not like the customer service. I tried once and wouldn't go back."}
