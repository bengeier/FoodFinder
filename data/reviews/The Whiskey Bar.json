{"text":"Nice bar with delicious cocktails and a pleasant atmosphere. However, their cocktail menu has prices listed at $12, but they charged me $15."}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends and the owner tried to over charge us for drinks. We also told him that one of us was the dd that night and he said we couldn't stay if everyone didn't order a drink-\"this isn't a park, you can't just sit here\". Overall staff was rude and would not recommend"}
{"text":"Love the place and decorations. Over 400 whiskey selections . Amazing atmosphere. A very unique whiskey bar"}
{"text":"There is something so intimate about this place. It's a small bar off the corner of Coventry and Euclid Heights, tucked next to Chipotle. As soon as you walk in, you see the wall of alcohol that looks like a piece of art itself. They have a small menu of drinks, if you want but you could try a flight of different whiskeys (minimum of three). My friend was able to work with the bartender with how much she wanted to spend and had him choose a few different types for her to try for her flight. I actually got the Sazerac because I had NOLA on my mind at the time. The Whiskey Bar has a downstairs/\"speakeasy\" area where they typically have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. We were there on a Friday night, but we didn't hear music at the time. They ended up giving us a small plate of meat and cheese on the house, so we were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality.   This is a great place a more intimate experience and a chance to try a variety of whiskeys that you may have never thought about. I'm definitely coming back here to check out the live music downstairs one night."}
{"text":"I think this place has the potential to be awesome. I went hoping that I could see the downstairs bar, with music being played. When I got there, only the upstairs bar was open. It is quite lovely inside. As many whiskeys to choose from as I could ever wish for. However, the man who served us was rude more than once. I felt belittled for choosing the less expensive of two whiskeys. When we asked if they would be serving food his answer was, \"Does it look like we are serving food?\" And finally, when I mentioned a friend we might have in common he only rolled his eyes. I would only think about going back if I knew that the downstairs lounge was open and music was being played. I hear that the musicians are awesome."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, I had high hopes for this place. The wall of whiskey that greets you is impressive. My go to drink is an Old Fashioned. They clearly are using homemade bitters, which were so overpowering poured with such a heavy hand that all I tasted was spices. Further it completely changed the color of the drink.   On top of the underwhelming drink, it was so hot. They need to use their AC! It was  * outside and that was cool compared to inside. We would have stayed for a second round but it was too hot!"}
{"text":"Although I know little to nothing about whiskey ....this place has a seriously cool vibe.  Went in on a Friday night with some girls and chilled in the basement bar while listening to the Chris Isaakish sounds of the small band.  Had a truly delicious whiskey sour, the best I've ever had.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this bar it has a great whisky selection, amazing cocktails free cheese plates, nice atmosphere and there's live music in the downstairs bar. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"This bar is scoring highly due to the sheer selection of whiskeys, bourbons, and ryes that they have on-site. The wall of liquor is a sight to behold. We ordered our standards - sazerac and a manhattan, and both were delicious and I thought fairly priced for a bourbon bar. We asked the bartender to pick the spirit for us and he did a great job and stayed within the listed price on the menu. I also appreciated the free finger foods that came along with the drinks.  I guess the reason that I'm deducting a star is that we were there at 8pm on a Saturday and the place was empty. We were the only customers. That's not a fault of the bar per se, but it creates a weird vibe when you're the only ones there. It was also disappointing that we did not therefore have spot-on service (we had to wait awkwardly to pay our tab). We also didn't know there was a downstairs. I think we'll be back but we'll do a walk-by to see if there are others inside first."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar, a little quirky and very intimate. Jimmie Hendrix, Queen, David Bowie and the rest of the \"greats\" played in the background. The owner/bartender made us custom cocktails based on our tastes. Drinks were carefully made and delicious. We will definitely be going back and will be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and walked in on a whim. The inside is decorated really nicely and had some interesting local artwork on the walls that are also for sale. Cocktails are expensive, but it's part of the experience. Drinks were made well and presented nicely. The downstairs bar was even cooler, more intimate and similar to La Cave next door in that it felt like it had been there 100 years and had an element of secrecy to it. Drinks were similar downstairs. Every Friday they have a guy singing in there who is unbelievable. FYI they do have Heineken and Stella on hand for beer drinkers in addition to all the whiskey."}
{"text":"Great service! Great atmosphere! Very accommodating. Around 400 diff whiskeys! Great place to bring a date. Very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"This place is small and a bit aloof for the neighborhood. It does have an amazing whiskey selection.  The bartender's (owner's) behavior is a bit off putting in that he does not seem to understand that craft cocktails are as much about the likability of the purveyor of the cocktail as they are about the alcohol; nobody wants to buy and drink a cocktail from a villain. He had a very condescending attitude towards my drink of choice for the evening; why stock it if you don't think people should drink it?   Go once to say you have been. Maybe your experience will be different than mine, but I doubt it. Then remember, there are more inviting places in Cleveland Heights with more sociable, likable and talented bartenders. I recommend The Fairmount and Nighttown. And, I have high hopes for Parnell's in its new location. As for The Whiskey Bar, it has a long way to go before it matches service with its amazing selection so, I can only give 1 star!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor... skip this place and go down to The Fairmount for a proper cocktail in the Heights. I live less than 200 meters from this place and wanted it to be good. It's well decorated - imitate and cozy, and the service was good - although a bit awkward. However, while the drinks were good enough (think we had a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned)... they were literally less than 2 ounces a piece... and cost $12-$14 (before tip) each. Frankly I was appalled. Take a look at the photos of less than half full glasses on Yelp - those are what they serve, not half finished drinks. We love the Velvet Tango Room, Porco, (and aforementioned Fairmount) and have not do have any issue spending $12-16 for a proper cocktail. What they serve here are not proper cocktails. Obviously these folks have not done their research to understand what a proper \"Whiskey Bar\" should be... and that's too bad."}
{"text":"So this is a very interesting spot. I'll start by saying why I took away a star. The primary issue that I had is that I felt the owner was just making up prices as he went. There are maybe 6 mixed drinks on the menu that range from about $10-$12. The owner offered to make me a custom drink nothing too fancy and it ended up costing me $25....yikes. On top of that, it was only \"okay\". This was our second round of drinks. Our first was a flight of 3 different whiskeys and I had a mixed drink on the side. The flight was $50 and my custom mixed drink was $12, with a 20% tip we paid a little more than $70, which was reasonable based on the whiskeys we chose. That's why the $25 mixed drink seemed like a made up price.  Overall the space is very cozy with about 10 to 12 seats. I did not visit the downstairs bar where there was suppose to be live music. However, we heard Kanye West playing through the floor, so I'm not sure how \" live\" it was and it definitely was not speakeasy.  Some reviews complained about the attitude of the owner...I could see it. Even though our experience besides the making up of prices, was really pleasant. There was another guy behind the bar who was very hospitable. Our drinks were served with a variety of finger foods that helped to bring out the flavor of the whiskey.   All in all, we had a really good time. However, I honestly doubt I'll go back. There's something off-putting when you feel you've been overcharged just because. Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it, just be sure to ask about the prices if you are offered a custom drink."}
