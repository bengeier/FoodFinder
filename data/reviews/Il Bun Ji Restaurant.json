{"text":"Two visits to Il Bun Ji. No complaints on the first meal; good meat in the Korean BBQ, prompt service. That's all I ask for in a Korean BBQ joint. 

I went again more recently and oy. What a mess. 

The one waiter (Yup. Thass right. Uno. Ein. Ichi.) was \"serving\" all the tables. That night had six tables occupied, one of which was a boozy party of 8 that was hogging our lone frazzled waiter.

I kind of felt sorry for poor schmo. Sure we had intolerable waits for each of our dishes but it wasn't his fault that his co-worker(s) went MIA. 

But when the other waitstaff hit the road, they must've kidnaped the chef too. Cuz whoever sliced the ribeye for our BBQ did a Jeffrey Dahmer hack job on the meat; uneven slabs of beef that were paper thin on one end and thick as a deck of cards on the other.

The kimchi jjigae that came with our BBQ was a piping hot crock of meh-ness.

If the food is good and cheap then bad service doesn't bug me. But spending sixty bucks on a meal for two, after tax and tip...well, badly butchered meat and off-in-Siberia waiters deliver a harsher sting.

I *might* give Il Bun Ji another chance to redeem itself but I'm sure as hell gonna do a headcount of the waitstaff before I commit to a meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled into Il Bun Ji while strolling down Koreatown one evening. I actually wasn't feeling much like having Korean food, so when I found out this place served sushi, we decided to go in!

....buuuut, when I saw the menu, somehow I ended up ordering a Korean dish after all :D It was a warm, humid-y kinda day and \"bibim naengmyun\" just sounded so good. 

We ordered: 
1) Bibim naengmyun: cold buckwheat noodles with gochujang sauce 
- the sauce was sweet and a little bit spicy, and went well with the chewy noodles, the cool cucumber, radish slices and bosc pear 

2) Unagi don: grilled eel on rice 

3) Some fresh sashimi: tasty and smooth, good value  

The first thing that came was the typical Japanese starter salad... but with a bowl of congee! Whaaaat. I knew it was supposed to be a Korean + Japanese place but where did congee fit? 

Anyway, next, a few Korean banchan came too. In the end, it turned out to be a LOT of food. It was all delicious though, and at the very end, we were given an icy cold orange pre-sliced. Juiciest orange ever, and perfect ending. 

Will be back here again!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years and decided to come back to something familiar because I'm very confused by all the korean fast food choices on the strip that are encased in foggy windows obscured by hand-written signs (don't get me wrong - they are charming, I just need a guide to go there). 

But back to Il Bun Ji... I was very pleased with the speedy arrival of the food - I should note it was 4 in the afternoon and there were three other tables present.

we ordered the classic comfort food, katsudon, which was among the better ones I've had in the city. it was really delicious and comparable to ones i've had in japan. we also ordered kimchi jigae (spicy tofu stew), which was really really hot and tasty, but not my favourite in korea town. homemade beef dumplings and yam rolls rounded out the meal. 

all in all, I was really pleased. it is nicer than many places on the strip. if you like the special sunken tables, they also have a few of these to offer. the day I went, they were playing CBC radio 2, lots of good music.

bill total for two people: $40 incl tip."}
{"text":"It's the Best value around!

How much do you think it would cost for -  5 domestic beers, apps, a main course, and dessert?    ... if I said $40.00 would you be impressed, well guess what.  IT's ONLY $20.00 bucks!  And the food is delicious.

Not only is the place trendy but they allow you to play your ipod over the restaurant speakers.

Recommendation;
You have to be upstairs for the sweet $20 food and beer deal.  Also order the Be bim bab (sp?) -- just say this, and they'll  know what it is...

Just go already... and thank me later

It's the Best value around!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!  Soooo impressed!  Bucket of 5 beers and incredible food for $20!!!

I was visiting with a group, including an experienced diner of this establishment, and he recommended the Bim Bap ( I think it was called).  The Bim Bap was essentially a hot skillet of deliciousness; though everyone's food looked amazing!  

And the main course which each of us ordered, was not the only food that was served for the beer and meal deal noted above.  The waiter brought additional food which was not even ordered, as they typically do in Japanese/Korean restaurants.  At the end of the meal they even assured we were satiated, indicated they would have brought more food for free had we desired!

I highly recommend this place for anyone who is out for some good food or is planning on drinking at least 5 beers and feels like doing so on a budget."}
{"text":"I love eating at this place. Can't remember the name, but really like the dish where you get all this raw beef and you need to cook it on a hot plate. Also the sushi is really good!"}
{"text":"It's another Korean restaurant in K-town. The decor and setup are really cool though- there are a couple of sections where everyone pops their shoes off and sits on the floor on cushions to eat. The other booths are separated by partial bamboo walls and have curtains to maintain privacy. I don't know how much privacy people really need while eating Korean food but whatevs...
 The food was good but we came here for dinner and found the staff to be a little distracted by the large crowds. It was kind of overpriced for being Korean food. For three average entrees, 3 drinks, an appetizer, and tip, our total was roughly $80. Oddly enough, the drinks were really well-priced for this place being downtown. My whiskey (Canadian Club) was ~$5 for a single. Not bad.
I like the decor but for my money, I'd try someplace else for the food."}
{"text":"Its good and the best you'll get along the Korea-town strip.  We generally get the hwae dup bap which is fresh and the cho gochuchang reasonably good, not over sweetened like it is prepared in a lot of Korean-run Japanese style restaurants in the city.  Stay away from their traditional Korean dishes.  Their strengths are sashimi/sushi dishes.  Not much of an ambiance, but acceptable."}
{"text":"AAAAAHHH, I was in town, dragged another out of towner friend here back in '11 because my last visit in '09 was really good,and $120 + was spent that time.Horrors, I can't cook well,and I could've done a better job.We blew $70 + on a sashimi ,sushi combo boat of regrets as it was INEDIBLE. Thankfully my other favorite,Kalbi saved us from running to McDonald's because that would've been better.Considering the money we were spending,you'd think they would be generous with the little appetizers I got before,didn't happen either. Will I return, NO,not sure whether it's a new owner,but they need a sushi chef if the same one from my last visit's still there."}
