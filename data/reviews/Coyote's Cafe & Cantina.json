{"text":"Ugg! We ate here these evening  only because We had a coupon Warning Sign 1 6pm and not busy The chips were good ,the salsa ok and they gave us bean dip. 

They are way over priced 13.99 for a SMALL chicken enchilada and a soggy taco Nothing had any flavor,Warning Sign 2  The waiter never came back to ask us about the food. My partner had the same thing and when the bill came it was almost25.00 with the coupon!

The worst was we had to wait 15 minutes for the bill and the waiter never came back to charge my card This is a neighborhood bar and restaurant and they must have a great happy hour cause it ain't the food or the service

Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The staff lovely feels like family,food wonderful and fast service. Salsa and bean dip with tortilla chip is also wonderful"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here and the service was horrible, the wait staff seemed lost and the manager was worse..after our order was finally placed and we recived our food it was completely wrong..we ate very little of it we didnt want to return it to the kitchem and wait another hour before we got food. Needless to say we will not be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced - Ten dollars for a burrito ala carte with no guacomole or sour cream. Shredded beef burrito was average quality but served luke warm.  Ordered regular margaritas - $4.99 on the menu but showed up as $6.49 on the bill.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on NYE... Great service! The bean dip was enjoyable. The food was below average considering the price. Not very authentic."}
{"text":"One of my most cherished spots for the last 15 years and home of the Best Margaritas in Las Vegas.  When you walk in prepare to be hit with an authentic Sante Fe New Mexico feel and a southwestern food with a slight twist. Free chips, salsa, and re-fried beans wet your appetite for an experience that is sure to lift the spirits. I normally stick with the carne asada or flautas but I've never had a bad meal in 15 years at this place."}
{"text":"The food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. It feels like I am sitting at a table in a Spanish home. It is a little pricy for some items, but totally worth it. And don't forget to try the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some good friends. I have to say, good service, decent food and a good margarita. Nothing spectacular, but good. A little pricey for the quality though. The main thing that upset me was, the \"fried ice cream\". We all know what fried ice cream is and when you're served a ball of ice cream rolled in soggy corn flakes... WTH... Not impressed. And they still charged me 7.99 after I complained about it. So, good service, decent food and drink, laughable dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place! Waiters are friendly and funny! Mexican Pizza is my favorite! Chips and salsa I can't stop eating. Very authentic food."}
{"text":"Pretty good! The steak fajitas are to die for...lol the staff was great during lunch."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this places for years and pretty much the same people have been working there. This place is so good the meals are big the prices are very reasonable. The service is fantastic and the food is so good like homemade nothing is pre packaged and you can taste the freshness and the flavors of the food mm so good!!"}
{"text":"Sat down at booth and saw the ceiling vent which was filthy.  Could only imagine kitchen. Got up and left. Won't be surprised if they show up on dirty dining."}
{"text":"Best Local Mexican food Happy Hour specials in town!!  See my pictures for the HH menu and prices.  

We come here often around 5pm for the Happy Hour 2:30pm to 5:30pm.   Their house margaritas are AMAZING and super strong!   The Happy Hour food servings are the same as the menu servings, so they are not \"cheating\" the customer here.  

The HH chicken quesadilla and flautas are our favorites!  We have ordered off the regular menu many times and find it a bit expensive - so happy hour is the pefect balance!

They serve complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The service is always excellent.  

While this is my first check-in and review, I have eaten here about a dozen times.  And will eat here another dozen more in the next few months!   Coyote's is kid friendly and our 2-year old loves the chicken quesadilla and flautas as much as we do.  

I want to give Coyote's 5 stars, but their expensive menu discourages us from visiting during normal hours.  I wish they would consider a \"locals\" special or coupon card."}
{"text":"This place was really awesome, they had amazing food and extremely amazing margaritas. Are waiter was really nice and helpful also and the atmosphere was great !! =))"}
{"text":"Typically eat here about once or twice a month and they never let me down. :)
Always good service and always good food (seriously the food is the same every time which is AMAZING!)
Small town feel and service which is so hard to find in this every changing wasteland called Sin City.
If you want glitz and changing menu's and celebrity names.......stay on the Strip.  If you want a decent meal and a comforting environment to eat it in.....come here."}
{"text":"This place use to be a lot better and I would give them a solid 4 stars but, any more they charge more, give you less and no customer appreciation, just here's your food and leave."}
{"text":"We visited Coyotes's on our trip to Vegas in August and ordered their steak, chicken and shrimp fajitas with rice and beans, the portions are large so my husband and I shared the plate they were so so so good.  I had a a mango margarita which was yummy.  For dessert my husband and I ordered the fried ice cream, it was AWESOME!!! 

The service was great our server was very attentive.  We will definitely come back on another trip to Vegas. Great ambiance, food, family atmosphere and clean.  100% better than the buffet we ate at on the strip."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before and enjoyed the food and service. However, on this occasion (Mothers Day) ,  we ordered a margarita. The happy hour well tequila was Montezuma, so we asked for a slight upgrade to Cazadores. Still not a top shelf tequila. We were charged $15 per drink. When we asked if that was right and about happy hour prices, we were given attitude, by our waitress and someone else who never did identify herself. We will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Not sure who the cook was for the evening, but we had dinner there on 1/1/15 and everything was bland from the bean dip and salsa to the main course. It's like they forgot how to season or did not season at all.  Very disappointed. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"awesome.  i can't speak to their whole menu, because i've only had a couple of items...i try to order other things but i particularly love the macho burrito!  

the complimentary chips are alway nice and warm.  delicious!  and their super friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Been a while but the drinks are cold and the food is good as always and the service is top notch as it always is"}
{"text":"Mexican food here is wonderful. The shredded beef taco plate is our favorite. Chips, salsa and bean dip come with every order. Margaritas can't be beat. We have been coming here for 16 years."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas and staying in Henderson. I ate here twice and had the chicken fajitas. They were one of the best I've had. The serving was very generous, the chicken was seasoned lightly. The salsa was fresh and tasty. My friend had the chicken salad with the creamy Italian dressing and said it was good."}
{"text":"The food here has been consistently delicious for as long as I can remember. They have a decent number of items on their menu, and their Happy Hour deals are awesome! Seriously, try their frozen fruit margaritas. You won't be disappointed. Every now and then we get coupons that make the prices even better (although we would still be willing to pay full price). The service is wonderful! They are all very friendly, and we usually do not have to wait long for our food. The enchiladas are perfect, and I love that they bring out chips with bean dip and salsa prior to our meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"Francisco was our server. We enjoyed our dinner on a Thursday night not a lot of people. Small place nice bar area. Tamale delicious.  Excellent service.  Greeted as we walked in. We will definitely return. Gracias por el marveloso servicio."}
{"text":"Excellent Margaritas, The food was \"Meh\"... The Happy Hour Guac is $1.00 more than the menu for a small. When brought to the servers attention and they said it was the \"Manager's decision\". service was good. Food was okay.. Had a Chile Relleno that was super tough however, the Green Chile Burrito had nice chunks of pork and was quite tasty. Guac is not tableside nor is it fresh, it is from a container so we sent it back. Overall it wasn't bad but doubt we will be back unless for the margaritas."}
{"text":"Great service - each of the waiters were very pleasant and attentive. Food was also great. Went during happy hour so got a good deal on margarita and guacamole."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was great. Nice quiet environment,  friendly staff. Waiter visited the table frequently to ensure we were set. The food seemed very authentic but with their own unique taste. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the lunch-special margaritas.  Four stars for the food.  Five stars for the service.  This is about as good as gringo-style Mexican food gets in Las Vegas.

Chips are always fresh and tasty as are the salsa and beans.  Personally, I love the crispy tacos at Coyotes, and the chile verde is different--served with potatoes--but still a cut above the chile verde most other places serve.

This is a good place to eat, relax, and have a good time.  The staff at Coyote's make the whole experience very pleasant and memorable."}
{"text":"I give it five stars for the service alone. Seriously, the best service I've received at a restaurant in a very long time. The salsa and bean dip is fantastic and our food was very good."}
{"text":"Service is alright. The prices are high for what you get. Plastic cups and serving dish foe chips. Booth seat is on concrete. Chips were stale salsa was good. 

The carne asada enchilada meat was dry over cooked and red sauce was dry. Wife had pork chile Verde which was moist and tender OK flavor. 

Drinks were overpriced and food was edible considering we were tired we should have left and went to taco bell."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Coyote's Cafe & Cantina was a few years ago when my husband's employer hosted the company holiday party there. We had a pleasant experience and for whatever reason, it came up again and we decided to host my husband's birthday dinner there this year. 

I made a reservation for a party of 22 the day before and the manager was a little weary at first, but I called an hour before on the day of to confirm our reservation and was told the table was ready and waiting for us.

When we arrived, we were escorted to our table where some of our guests had already been seated and tended to. Our servers were amazing. They were very patient and made no mistake. I never saw an empty bowl of chips or empty glasses. They worked our table from start to finish and I was very impressed.

I did think that the prices were a little high compared to other places of a similar atmosphere, but the food was good and the service made up for it.

I will visit again!"}
{"text":"First time here, under new ownership but I guess same employees and management.  Met the new owner.  Owner and staff were great.  Best service I've had in a long time.  Food was amazing.  I used to always eat at the Mexican food place in the Sunset Station which is no longer there.  This will be my new Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican food places in Vegas.  I like that the staff is so friendly and always remembers us when we go.  I'd much rather spend my money on a small, neighborhood restaurant than a big chain.  I really like their chips (which are always served warm) and salsa and usually order their fajitas."}
{"text":"Much better then the critics from the RJ and weekly have rated it. Low key environment in the heart of Henderson where the prices won't break you and you can still get a very flavorful dish. I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food in Vegas, but yet it's one of two I always crave when thinking about Mexican fare. Margaritas are good too and they offer plenty of flavors for everyones tastes. Beans and salsa are more addicting then any other place so be careful bc they are generous and will keep filling you back up. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Henderson/las Vegas. Very polite and have never had an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a very long time. The service has always been great and I have never left dissapointed. The margaritias are good the food is good. I always get the combo fajitas for two. It could actually feed 3! It comes with chicken steak shrimp and an array of veggies. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is very cozy."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Bean dip and chips while you're waiting is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Timely service. Friendly staff. No complaints on the food!! This place is packed. Either people know about it due to location or word of mouth. Very far from strip. It has gaming as well."}
{"text":"We went there all the time in the early 2000's. The waiter was saul. Does anyone know if he's still there?"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town 7 days a week 2-5:30 and the fools and drinks are all half off.   I have been coming here for years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Three of us went there last night. A saturday night out, the place was sort of busy. The hostess was nice and all, sat us. It comes to the table with beans and salso which is nice. We had noticed when we walked in the  lunch specials were still on the chalkboard, but then marked in a separate box were thee separate specials. We assumed they were the dinner specials. When the waiter got to the table, he asked what we would like. We said the Asada enchiladas on the board. He took our order, said nothing of it not being on special for dinner, said nothing of it being $6 a plate more!
We eat, we all said for it was just ok, glad it was on special. Then came the bill. We asked the waiter why it was more, and he said that it was not a special for dinner. Then why did he know what we wanted when we ordered from \"the board\"? Why did he not tell us it was more. Plus when we asked about it, he was very matter of fact. Just, 'it is not on special.' Not, \"oh I'm sorry there was a misunderstanding. Maybe we can do something.\" or anything. Just, nope not a special and walked away.
The whole experience was terrible. If you want better food at a better price, go to Salsa Loca or El Ausente both in east Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Here for the first time ! Very clean inside and I mean for being an older building not a lick of dust or dirt anywhere! The food was average but the service was above average!! Very polite , prompt and nice ! 

Thank you for a great visit !!"}
{"text":"Imma just say it, I'm biased as fuck. Mainly because I've been eating here my whole life, but also because their food is always consistent and really fkn good. Just be sure that if you do eat here, the best shit you can eat are tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, and, well that's about it. If you want a filling meal with some chips and salsa that are surprisingly much better than other Mexican places in the area, with fresh fried taco shells and some chicken that literally is some of the juiciest shit in the world, go here."}
{"text":"Went here with a party 
of 8 after a gymnastics meet it was great food and wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. The restaurant is super clean, the food is super delicious and the service is superb! Oh wait, I can say something else positive! The prices are great! If you have never been here you are missing out! Yum!"}
{"text":"I agree with the reviewer who said \"no value at all.\" That statement pretty much sums up the food at this restaurant. I wanted to like this place. I thought the decor was very cute with a southwestern theme throughout. It felt cozy and quaint. The decor earns the one star. Our server was pleasant, but once bringing over our food didn't really ever come back to check if everything was ok. 

The food was average at best. The prices were ridiculous. My carnitas \"platter\" was $16.99 and it was a handful of meat, a tablespoon scoop of guacamole, a tablespoon of sour cream, some tasteless beans and rice. The pork was not dry, but it was very flavorless. And being limited on guac, sour cream or any type of sauce to add for flavoring due to the server never coming back around to check on us, my plate was left half eaten. While still a solid amount of food on my plate, another female server comes from behind and asks if I am done. I say yeah, probably....does she offer a box for three quarters of my meal? Nope. I, in nicest way possible, reclaim my plate and ask her for a box. She trots off and drops one off at our table.

Boyfriend had a \"macho burrito\" which was $14.99...pretty standard, average burrito - in portion and taste. We didn't bother waiting for someone to come by to ask for another box, so we just piled it up in mine.

We ordered a strawberry margarita to share..it was ok tasting..they of course use low quality tequila like cuervo in it, but the price was $11.99!

A simple bean and cheese burrito was $10.99. Beans and cheese and a tortilla...$11 bucks.  They need to truly re evaluate their prices or really improve on their food if they plan on sticking around."}
{"text":"Happy Hour   margaritas were awesome and only 2.99.... Food was good. I had enchiladas. Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life! The food was extremely bland and soggy. Salsa tasted like it was straight outta the Jar. (yuk)The old man server told us in his 100 years of working there he had only one other person complain. LOL I hardly doubt that."}
{"text":"Food tasted like it came out of a can and just warm. Dinning room needs to be cleaned.  Was overpriced.  Plus side waiter and chips good.  Not worth a return."}
{"text":"This spot has been fairly consistent for a number of years, and I must admit that it has even improved steadily over the past few years in particular.

1.) Food is very good
2.) Staff is receptive and responsive
3.) Service is genuine
4.) The place does need a bit more atmosphere in the \"music\" area / realm
5.) Management is courteous and present

I definitely recommend this spot for Mexican food if you are in the Sunset / Green Valley area."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a local Mexican restaurant with a bar.  The review on here for the margaritas sealed it.  I seated myself at the bar and was served drinks and chips immediately. They also serve a bean dip that is yummy.   I had the fajitas and they were yummy. Maybe too much meat and not enough veggies for my taste. But delicious. The grilled steak was delicious.  Got in an happy hour, and hard to beat $2.99 margaritas.  Watched the footy match during lunch. Nice experience. I will be back when my travels take me to Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Their frozen margaritas are still as good as ever.

The hot basket of chips and accompanying salsa and beans are fresh and tasty. Service was very good and on top of the action. Main entrees are big and yummy. We used a coupon which made this meal a steal of a deal. Would pay full price.

They can get busy but we never had an issue getting seated. That is great news since this place is like a hidden gem even on busy Sunset Rd. given its location.

Will be back, no doubt."}
{"text":"We didn't wait long to be seated and were greeted at the door by a patron leaving who ensured us the meal would be great. 

Boy, was he wrong!

We had decent hopes, but it just didn't work out. 

There's no way that I'm going to pay $2.99 for a soda, without being at some sort of special event where these are expected prices. 

The people who entered and seated after us were seen first for their order. Really?

So, I ordered a chicken burrito meal, with beans and rice. I asked for the burrito to be without the tortilla. I got some funny looks from the guy, Saul, taking my order. 

We were served our food and I had a plate full of burrito filling... nothing else. We asked one of the female staff if the burrito came with beans and she had to go get Saul to answer. He cam back, after taking care of 2 other tables. Then I explained to him I still wanted the rice and beans. I was provided a very small portion of rice and a slop of beans next to it. 

We never had to wait for water, that was really the only plus. 

Oh, and my cloth napkin was dirty from the get go. Gross. 

Our meal, with 2 waters, cost $35, for LOW QUALITY food. 

I don't understand how this could be anyone's favorite place to go, unless they've NEVER had good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Small little bar with lots of seating in dining area.  Food is excellent never had a bad meal. Staff is very friendly. Happy hour everyday from 2-5:30."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 15 years. Always great food and service. The prices are very fair, and the drinks are great - especially the margaritas. A++. If you have not been go - it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We went here because the Mexican place down the street went out of business. Some guy was standing out in front of the place handing out coupons for Coyote's. We gave it a try...it was terrible. The food was horrible. My wife and mom both got vegetarian enchiladas and they were drowned in cheese and tasted off and weren't fresh. I had a chicken salad...terrible. $14.95 for a few strips of chicken, some brown lettuce, brown avocados and cheap, canned olives. Salsa= straight out of a one of those plastic containers at the grocery store, terrible. Service was good except for the girl that was refilling waters had a sour look on her face and didn't want to be there, only filling my water 3/4 of the way like she was conserving it as if we were in Mexico....

food was horrible...don't go here."}
{"text":"Changed their prices 18$ for two taco plate!!! Crazy won't go back and the portion was smaller too !!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Don't discount a non chain  restaurant. Always love the food and the service. I am a regular at this place. Keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"By far the best service and the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  The chili Relleno  is over the top the best!!   Absolutely love that they bring delicious beans with the chips before the meal. Can't wait to go back for more.  So good. Five star rating all the way."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  2-5:30, great deals on apps and margs!

House margaritas are strong enough to compel me to write this review after just the first one!

I always judge a Mexican restaurant by their cheese enchiladas, as that is my favorite dish that I order everywhere I go.  This place did not disappoint!!  Although pretty much I could fill up on chips and bean dip - it's worth waiting for the food!"}
{"text":"my parents have taken me to coyotes ever since I was in my mothers stomach she craved Mexican food when she was pregnant. coyotes is so close to my house that it was perfect, my parents would always kick back and have a couple margaritas while I enjoyed my root beer and bean and cheese burrito. but unfortunately business started to go down the drain for coyotes, and their prices shot up. my family stopped attending. 

I went a few weeks ago with my bestfriend and the food I ate with my friend was mediocre at best. it was nothing like what it was when I was growing up. very disappointing."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. It looks like a hole in the wall but once your inside the experience starts. One of the best Mexican places in Vegas. We moved to Summerlin and still make the drive to eat here. The service and food are amazing! The prices are great and the portions huge. Also love the chips and salsa! Highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for New Mexican restaurant. We loved it. Food was amazing and priced well. We will be returning next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Recommended by several, and we looked forward to what promised to be New Mexican style plates.  The service was very good, but the food was disappointing.  Chili con Queso...I'm not sure what they are thinking with this, it's really just a gummy mess.  Red Chile sauce, no bueno.  Margarita pretty good, enchilada's, not enough ranchero sauce.  It's possible we give this place another look, but not probable."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss the Crab Enchiladas in Verde (green) sauce!  One of my favorite Mexican plate of food anywhere.  They have the best chips, salsa and hot bean dip to snack on while waiting for your entrees as well.

*insider Tip*

If there is a wait for the restaurant, walk into the cantina and seat yourself.  It never fails for me...there is always at least one booth available immediately to the left of the cantina entrance (a bit hidden.)  I also think the service is much faster in the cantina as the waiters are in there often getting drinks for the restaurant customers."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have gone here since I was little and ever since moving away we try and come here every visit! Best steak fajitas and BEST blended margaritas! Favorite place for sure! Great staff and yummy food and drinks :)"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the prices were way too high. A 2 item combo with and beans is $18."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place 1 star but Yelp requires at least 1 ton posy. Having recently moved here from OC, it's very difficult to find decent Mexican food at a sit-down restaurant and we were hoping to find a favorite cantina we could count on.

At first glance, the aesthetics held a lot of promise. Typical, familiar and nice restaurant layout.

We sat down and opened our menus- way pricey for typical cantina-style restaurant. 10.99 single taco with rice and beans anyone? The chips came... Cold and all broken pieces. Salsa was bland. Had to ask them to bring something hotter with flavor.

I ordered a chimichanga with chicken; hubby had carne asada tacos ($15-ish each dish!) Food was terrible. Cut into my chimichanga and a ton of watery chicken (canned?) came leaking out. Rice was bland.  Carne asada tacos were tough and not well seasoned. The waiter asked how we liked it since my burrito was virtually uneaten. Offered to bring another type of dish out but I was over it. They should have offered to remove it off the bill but they didn't.

To top it off, we were subject to the LOUDEST trio of women (not drunk) behind us that drew dirty looks from everyone in the room. You couldn't hear anything except for their conversation and giddy laughter from taking selfie after selfie. Will NEVER go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a kid; it's a great family restaurant and has stayed constant in its great service and yummy comforting food.  

The tamales are better here than at any other comparably priced Mexican restaurant, but they don't have the traditional pork...only beef or chicken tamales.

The margaritas are great.  The chips are always warm and served with salsa and beans.  I got tortilla soup the other day, and the waiter brought me the bowl of soup with the tortillas and cheese on the side so I could add as much or as little as I wanted.   It was a nice touch.

My husband had the Chile Relleno and thought it was amazing.  I really have no complaints!"}
{"text":"This place is...absolutely average with prices higher than average.  Honestly, I would not return here unless it was so close to the Galaxy Luxury+ Theater.  But, since it is right next door, I do manage to go here every five or six weeks.  So, just be prepared for some extremely average food and what seems like an extra $10-$15 on the bill.  Obviously I don't hate eating here, but it always feels like a compromise when I do."}
{"text":"Servers are very attentive the food is delicious and we've been coming here for quite some time, so that ought to tell you everything you need to know"}
{"text":"when I lived in Vegas I used to come here all the time...the service is great, the food, especially the pork tacos and cheese enchiladas are phenomenal and their ultimate margaritas give even a guy like me a decent buzz....One of the few things I miss about living in Vegas is going here...the one star reviewers are high on drugs to give such sad reviews of this place...since moving here to Oregon it's been quite the journey to find any place remotely comparable..."}
{"text":"This is a great local Mexican Restaurant next to Luxury+ Theaters and Barley's Casino.  They have great margaritas ($24 for a pitcher). I love the family atmosphere of the restaurant and they obey traditional rules of a successful Mexican restaurant: Chips/Bean Dip/Salsa, Water without asking, friendly staff.

Beef Chimichanga and Combination Fajitas were both ordered and were devoured!

Note to diners, Arrive by 8pm as the kitchen closes early if they are slow. This is the reason I am giving it a 4 star.  The Joe's Crab Shack is opened until 11pm next door. The bar does have video poker! Not sure if they comp drink though, if you play."}
{"text":"The food and service are good but it's too pricey compared to similar restaurants in the area. Wife, daughter and I had lunch, no dessert and no drinks, and it came to $55 with tip."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere was all excellent.  We got right in and everything was quick.  Attentive staff.  The drawback is the prices are too high for what it is.  $15 for two plain cheese enchiladas is over the top.  Might be back but probably will be a while since there are more affordable selections that are just as good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is what Lindo's used to be. Authentic, delicious and quality! There is no water or grease in my plate no matter what I order.
Which has become the normal at Lindo.
The service is amazing! They are kind, fast but do not rush you."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants around. Looks like nothing on the outside but you'll feel right at home on the inside. Get anything on the menu and try not to fill up on the chips."}
{"text":"The staff here was so very very friendly! I would return just to chat with them - but there was plenty more to like.  The salsa was delicious, the beans were lard free and the chips were piping hot.  My lunch was also fresh and tasty and not smothered in cheese or anything like that.

I would highly recommend stopping in for the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Staff is amazing and food is to notch. Fajitas are my favorite followed closely by anything with shredded beef!"}
{"text":"I love that they bring chips,  salsa,  and bean dip! best salsa in town, but after 2 flop meals I only go to the bar now & keep it simple. come for the Margarita lunch special & a taco"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not as experienced in Mexican food, but I'm not a total stranger to it having lived in California...

So let's cut to the chase. This place is kinda cool because it has the older mom and pop restaurant feel but the food is pretty typical. Nothing more than Chevy's...or I should describe it as, Chevy's food placed on scratched up white heavy ceramic plates is what gives this place an edge. 

Service is decent. I think the dude that stands up front greeting everyone with muchacho to muchacha is quite hilarious. But, that's all that we were truly entertained with."}
{"text":"It's hard not to like a place where the host greets you with \"muchacha\" as you walk in. And, when the waiter asks what you want to drink at lunch during the week, and then throws in \"tequila\" to the laundry list of standard drinks (i.e. soft drinks and iced tea) .... well, you've just got to smile. Your meal starts with warm, perfectly crisped tortilla chips served with salsa and re-fried beans and only satisfies further from there. I've had several things on this menu (most recently, their fish tacos) and have always left with a full stomach (leaving most of the food behind -- the portions are HUGE!!) after a satisfying meal. You can't go wrong with Coyote's -- they serve relatively cheap, good food with great service."}
{"text":"Coyote's Cantina is a throwback restaurant to my first experiences of traveling with my friends in high school to eat lunch/dinner after class.  I reminds me of first getting my car and going to the old United Artist theatre to watch movies.  I haven't been back to Coyote's in years but returned today on a spur of the moment lunch with some buddies.

Upon entering, Coyote's had a few folks at the bar sipping their famous Margaritas.  We were seated promptly and brought drinks, chips, and bean and salsa dip.  The chips and dips were delicious and the lunch menu was reasonable and vast with selections.  I order the crab enchiladas and my buddies went with Carne.  

Overall, the food was all great, fast, and the service was on par with any good Mexican restaurant in Vegas.  I'm a huge fan of Lindo here in town, however, Coyote's was a nice trip down memory land and a place I plan to revisit very soon."}
{"text":"Delicious very good food always enjoy it here n Yummy margaritas : ))) Great service fun friendly staff"}
{"text":"Pretty nice food. Very attentive and nice waiters and waitresses and greeters at the door. But I've been to a good amount of Mexican restaurant, yet I felt like some of the food wasn't authentic enough. I feel like it needs some more sauce on the food that I ordered which is called arroz con pollo. But for that night tonight still the best  mexican restaurant I have went to in Las Vegas at least for now"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Mexican food place that was really good since I moved here from Southern California 11+ years ago. This is the first place that I have been in the Vegas Valley where the salsa doesn't taste like it came from a can. The burrito I ate was well prepared and delicious! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and prompt

Food was just ok. Enchiladas and Burritos seemed to be runny. No better way to describe it. Food came out very fast. Almost felt like it was pre assembled and then just reheated quickly. It tasted ok, but the consistency was off.

Also a bit pricey for what you get compared to other Mexican restaurants. The quality is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"The staff was nice the food just ok and they don't honor our military with any discount, and the menu really expensive."}
{"text":"Went last night prior to movie...worth trying due to positive reviews.  Got chips and salsa, found hair in salsa as chip was heading to mouth.  Then, looked in glass of water and saw what looked to be what I hope was a small piece of paper with writing but server said it might be a bug.  Got right up and left, won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for years.  Classic Mexican/American food done well.  The staff makes you feel like a regular every time.  The fajita's are awesome.  I am a big guy and I can't finish one by myself.  My favorite is the chili relleno's, they come in several styles and are presented festively.  All I need is a negra Modello and my meal is complete."}
{"text":"I had the fajitas and a margarita. Marg was good and the fajitas were decent, but nothing to write home about. 3 stars because this is a Mexican restaurant and the chips and salsa were only on par."}
{"text":"They should change the name of Coyote's to Zarapes as that is easily the best thing on the menu!  We have been going to Coyotes for over 10 years and have always received excellent service and the food is always great.  The dinner Zarape portion is enough for me and my husband to split and walk out feeling over stuffed.    Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Easy access and good location. Menu limited Mexican options. Asked for the house specialty. Uninspired taste and food was served lukewarm. Dirty glass and prices are medium high for Mexican lunch food. Alot of good competition in the category and probably won't repeat."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place I'm Mexican and knows good  food this is closest to my moms cooking . It's not tex mex like other ones Lindo michocan is over rated not good at all"}
{"text":"My family and I were craving Mexican food, but didn't want to leave our neighborhood. We found this little hole in the wall, which the server told us had been there for decades. 

We were seated right away next to the bar, which made my frozen mango margarita super quick to the table. It's basically all I had been craving all day, and it didn't disappoint. They also bring you fresh chips and warm beans and salsa, which was nice. My husband and I shared the combo fajitas for two, and my daughter had the Enchiladas Rancheros. They weren't busy, so service was quick. The meal came, and we were all quite satisfied. 

Honestly, there was only two things that we did not like. First of all, which was beyond their control, a couple of older blonde ladies were sat right next to us, and they loudly spoke the entire time we were there. We had to listen to them complain about the food (before they even ordered), complain about the staff, and then listen to their entire life stories while we ate. As I said before, completely not their fault that these snooty women ruined our meal, but would have been nice to have some space from them since the restaurant was mostly empty. 

The last bit I will add, our \"fried ice cream\". We had been looking forward to ordering this item, and had saved room for it in the end. It came to our table seconds after we ordered it, and we soon discovered why. It seemed as though it had been pre-fried. The whole thing was cold, and the outer breading was chewy and unappealing. I actually ended up just peeling it all off to take a bite of just the ice cream. Unfortunately, that made for an expensive $9 scoop of ice cream. 

We will definitely return in the future, most likely for margaritas and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a hotel staffer from the hotel nearby. She mentioned that it was authentic Mexican and that it was one of her favorite places, so my co-worker and I decided to try it out. Seeing as I love Mexican food, it was an obvious decision to go. It wasn't too far from the hotel, just a few hundred feet actually.The staff was very friendly. We were greeted and seated  within seconds. Chips, salsa and re-fried beans appeared on our table within minutes. The restaurant was very clean, with brownish walls and decorated with the typical decor you'd see in any Mexican restaurant. We were there around noon, it wasn't overly busy, but busy enough during lunch. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. I'd say our food arrived within 5 minutes of us ordering our food. I had ordered the 2 combination special, and had chosen a chille relleno and a chicken enchilada. I'd have to say, that both were just okay. I was expecting the chile relleno to be quite delicious,but it was just all right. The chile had some heat to it, but the egg batter was all mushy and the cheese wasn't gooey and melted enough. The chicken enchilada was a little better. The chicken was tastier and soft.  The rice was pretty dry. Wasn't as great as I thought, or was expecting. I probably wont' be back, I'd like to try other restaurants in the area. But, it was definitely worth the try. Great service though! Maybe it's what I ordered!"}
{"text":"A buck or two more expensive than your standard Vegas Mexican fare, but very good food and the servings are absolutely enormous.

My nachos (yes, as my wife keeps reminding me, I know they are supposed to be an \"appetizer\" to be shared) came with a TROWEL rather than a fork."}
{"text":"We went in for Dinner and were forgotten about! 
 
We ordered drinks and were left alone for 45 min! Watched the waiter intentionally dodge us.  Finally had to flag down the chip man to make our waiter come over to us but by the time he came over we were full on chips. Too bad cause the food did look pretty yummy

NOTE TO WAIT STAFF : customers dont love bieng forgotten about lol"}
{"text":"I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.

As I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out. 

Decided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita. 

I had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.

Won some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat"}
{"text":"I go back and forth with this restaurant. I've been coming here a long time. I do like the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. It's my favorite part about gong to a Mexican restaurant.... Instant snacks! 
The chips come out hot and are refilled as needed. 

Service is usually pretty good. Our waiter made an great effort and kept our drinks refilled. 

I just feel that the quality of the entrees don't equal the price. The food is ok, but not amazing. 

I ordered the taquitos dinner, but the rice was dry. Beans and taquitos were average. I had mine filled with beef which was ok. My friend ordered a burrito but she found it to be dry. She thought it should have had some cheese on it.  All in all $30+ for two mediocre entrees doesn't seem to be that good of a deal."}
{"text":"With so many actual  Mexican restaurants closing in town and In the casinos it was nice to find this hidden gem. Service was great , food was great but a little pricey and parking was horrible. Other than that we will be back ."}
{"text":"I honestly would've only given them 3 stars for the food, but I bumped them to 4 because their staff is just so warm, friendly, and most importantly, very attentive.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and typically quiet. It feels like you're nestled inside a little pueblo trimmed with subtle mexican decor, and contrasted by a nice modern stained-glass window. Spanish music softly plays to accompany the whole ambience. It's a nice touch. 

After you get seated, they start you right off with some complimentary chips along with a zesty salsa and warm bean dip. It's good! I think I actually enjoyed eating this better than my entree. (I had the chicken enchilada, but for me, it wasn't anything too special.)

My boyfriend usually gets the chicken burrito, which he loves. I typically just drink and take advantage of their happy hour, which is from 2 - 5:30. I've got to say that they must have a heavy-handed bartender because their margaritas are consistently strong. Translation: You get the most bang for your buck. Whether frozen or on the rocks, they're the best deals! You will get a satisfying buzz going off of just one. Trust me."}
{"text":"Food is good, nice ambience, full bar, and kids menu.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip keep coming. Pricing is a few dollars more than similar restaurants but the staff is very attentive and there was no waiting for a table to make up for it. Lunch specials include a Zarape that is a great first time choice."}
{"text":"I tried this place several months back and was pleased.  We were on this side of ton after picking out some flooring and decided to stop in for dinner. This wasn't the same experience as the last. 

Started out with \"Chili Con Queso\". This was very cheesy and delicious.

The prices seem to have gone up. I ordered the same thing as last time \"Enchiladas Real\" which is simply 2 cheese enchiladas and some rice and beans. It went from $9.99 the last time to $13.00. I asked the server to have them made with flour tortillas instead of corn. When he brought out our food he even said they were made with flour tortilla as he set them down so I knew he heard my order correctly. By this time he has walked away and my soda cup still empty. As I bite into my enchilada I taste that it was not made with flour tortillas. I had to wait 10 minutes until he came back to check on us to tell him about it. By this time the rest of my party had practically finished what they were eating. When I told the server he was very apologetic that it was wrong but never remade it! I still haven't gotten a refill on my drink by the way. When the server came to clear out table he saw i didn't eat my food except for the 1 bite. He offered to give me dessert to make it right. I said that was OK I would rather the meal just be taken off the check. 5 minutes later he brings an amazing looking ice cream. It was delicious and very thoughtful but being honest here he should have simply removed the meal from the check. 

The restaurant was clean and the food I did eat was good. My main complaint is with the service and how they choose to handle things. With the expensive prices it might just be worth skipping the future."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best. The chips, salsa and bean dip are phenomenal.

I come here often for happy hour and always have their Mexican Pizza. Pretty tasty. Their Margaritas are also delish. Letty is usually bartending, she's great. Very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"i have been coming to this place for years! I have every birthday dinner here I love the staff very nice the owner is very friendly the food is great always a enjoyable time! planning on coming here tonight for my brothers birthday so excited !  only thing I wish they did was bring back there coupons :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Not my first trip and will not be the last. The place is warm and cozy with a cantina feel. 
They start by bringing out chips with refried beans and salsa to start.
I had the Chille Rellanos with Chicken with comes with beans and rice as most entres do. Very good, had just enough heat to make you feel warm after coming in from an ugly rainy day. I was with some other co workers who all enjoyed their meals.
Last several times there i had the fish tacos and almost ordered them again but decided it was time to try something better..good choice..: )
They do offer lunch specials which is a plus
Staff was on point and quick with several refills of our beverages"}
{"text":"My first time back in quite a few years because I'm a former chef who loves cooking at home. But I'm glad I returned and introduced my BFF to this place. It was just as good as I remembered, and my bestie, who had steak fajitas, could not stop raving over how tender the steak was and delicious everything else was. I tried a piece of her steak and she was right about how it seemed to just melt in her mouth. My enchaladas were better then I expected and of course the chips, salsa, and bean dip were great and inspired me to go home to make my own version of their salsa. In addition to the food, the service was top notch from start to finish which is a huge deal to me since I will refuse to return to a place if the service is poor regardless of how great the food is or how hard to find a product is. Overall this former chef was impressed and will definitely be making an effort to return more often. This place almost feels like one of Green Valley's better kept secrets, especially since it may be a bit hard to find if you don't know what your looking for due to the signage outside being minimal and the colors don't necessarily stand out."}
{"text":"5 -star service! Each time I've come here, the service has been quick and attentive, by every staff member from the host to the waitress and the busser. My boyfriend and I were here just recently and also had a great time. My favorite item on their menu are the enchiladas, highly recommend. The only negative about this place is that the prices on are on the higher side."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Vegas area. Always great food and great service. I love the enchiladas real."}
{"text":"Very good food and consistent service. We have been going here for years and the employees are great. It is a little expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Good service.  Food served hot.  Had chicken enchiladas.  Wife had beef fajitas.  Have had tastier enchiladas other places.  Thought prices were a little higher than some competitors"}
{"text":"Tried Coyote's Cafe last night. Good bean dip and salsa, great fajitas!! Excellent service-we will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food and margaritas in Vegas...Going there tonight and cant wait to have my favorite on the menu... beef fajitas!!
Amazing servers and service brings it all home."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than a restaurant that won't seat you and you can see empty tables. Horrible service from the hostess. I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and like every other Mexican restaurant it's very disappointing. 
Our waiter was very nice along with everyone else in the place. Friendly, courteous and it has a nice ambience and good margaritas (hence my 2 stars) 
Food was very bland. Now because I lived in Mexico I'm very picky which is why I try to avoid any Mexican restaurant because it always leads to disappointment. I had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce, nothing special and nothing I would order again. My husband had steak fajitas. The steak was tender and not too bland but still didn't care for it. I ate two bite of my enchiladas. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals tho. 

Hot bean dip was apparently very good (I don't like beans so I can't agree or disagree with this statement) the salsa was also bland along with their chips. It's complimentary though. Leaving the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry sadly."}
{"text":"This place has declined in qualitry in the last few years.  Not to mentions how RIDICULOUS their prices have gotten!!!!  WOW.  There are so many mexican restaurants in Las Vegas/Henderson that it is just inexcusable to have bland and overpriced food.  We had a taco salad, carnitas that had no flavor at all, a beef burrito and a quesadilla that all of us shrugged at.  Frankly, Super Mex right down the street is much better."}
{"text":"My family first moved to Las Vegas in like 2001 from the Pacific Northwest. If I think about it, Coyotes was my first TRUE Mexican cuisine experience and it is continually a favorite to this day. The staff is incredibly friendly and inviting. I don't know if he realizes this, but one of the waiters has been calling me(and everyone) \"buddy\" since I was 11. We will always be back. We've never had a bad experience in 15 years!"}
{"text":"Poor quality food HIGH prices. Order Enciladas and the will stuff one small piece of meat in each side. BAD DEAL"}
{"text":"Just went back and it was not good. Only the waiter who has a great attitude and sense of humour, asking people if they want more tequila but he really means water. Everything tasted different than I had remembered. The salsa that came with the chips-gross, red sauce on burritos-gross."}
{"text":"I don't live here and came with family.  I have been here several years ago but didn't remember the food.

I am eating a healthier diet and the fam assumed this Mexican was like our normal place.  Not so.  We eat at a local place and have Baja style tacos for $2.50 ea and an amazing shrimp ceviche tostada for $3.50.  We can feed a family of 4 for about the same price as ONE entree here.

My a la carte taco was in a fried shell.  I have never had that before and I eat Mexican at least once a week.  Also $5.50 ea!  Robbery.

Anyways, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Delicious bean dip served with the normal chips & salsa.  Great service and quick drink refills."}
{"text":"Bottom line: mediocre. It didn't make me sick, but I won't be going back, either. The service was just okay & food was bland. It wasn't worth the calories to even finish, so I stopped eating midmeal."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Food was nice and fresh and the service was outstanding! Not once did we have to ask for more chips and salsa or refills on our drinks. We will definitely be back when we come back into town."}
{"text":"Come here for the delicious chips/salsa/bean dip and the excellent frozen margaritas, but that's all.  The prices are ridiculously high.  

$18 for a carne asada burrito???  

$14 for a bean burrito???  

The food is good, but just not worth the price.  And its such a shame, because I remember coming here years ago when the place was packed.  Now its a ghost town inside.  I came back because I got a coupon in the mail.  Instead of sending out coupons, they should just lower the prices.  

I'll be back for happy hour, but I'll never sit down for dinner again."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is nice, but do not order he vegetarian burrito. It seems like just a frozen mix of broccoli, cauliflower, and orange and yellow carrots warmed up, wrapped in a tortilla, and some salsa put on top. The veggies aren't grilled or spiced. The veggies just fall out of the burrito if you try and cut it. I ate less than a quarter of it and then finished he rice and beans (which were good) and left the burrito. I went home and made something for a snack since this was so disappointing and I was still hungry.

My parents had the steak fajitas and the combo with the chile rellenos and they were pleased and said they would return. They had wished the server had told us about any specials and about the happy hour drink specials. I probably won't be back since I can get a much better veggie burrito for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nasty food and as a first timer coming here I find hair in my food! That is so awful and my husband was so disappointed with his meal. You barley get anything and the price is high. Will not return. Wasn't even Mexican food. I been to better places. I was wondering why they were empty there was barley anyone in the restaurant. Asked someone else a  customer and they said that that fajitas were so over cooked"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around. This place represents exactly what I like in a good Tex-Mex meal. To top it off, the staff is extremely friendly, The frozen margaritas are the best anywhere, and the bar top poker machines have been very generous during my visits. This place is one of the best experiences you can have for Mexican dining meal"}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent and was packed years ago. The quality went down and the prices are way up. No value at all. They need to get this place back to where it used to be."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We had lunch today and it was a little pricey, but the servings were huge: more than we could eat. Service was top-notch. Both our waiter and the host (and possibly manager) were terrific and had a great sense of humor. Also loved the ambiance and decor. The food was good, but the margaritas were great. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This mexican restaurant is one of me and my family's all time favorite.  We have been going there for many years now and the same people have worked there all this time.  It's nice to see familiar faces that also happen to remember our faces.  The food is excellent and their salsa is our absolute favorite from any restaurants we have been to.  The atmosphere is delightful, the food is served hot and tasty and the service is impeccable.  This will always be our number 1 choice for mexican food."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall place had an authentic vibe to it. Although, the service was not that great. When I went in and dined in with several other people, it was very busy and loud. I was told usually it is not that busy and you can hear people's footsteps, but this time it was busy. Our service took a very long time. Each time we needed something we needed to yell out for our waiter. And when we saw the manager he said \"hold on let me get your waiter\". As a manager you should be able to assist guests, it's not just a waiters job, especially when a guest asks you directly for something. We only had one round of drinks and our waiter never even bothered to refill our drinks. I was not fond of the bread on top of the chile relleno, but the carne asada inside was good."}
{"text":"So far so good! We popped in while in the area and looking for some Happy Hour refreshment. Fantastic bartender who's been there since 1991 I believe and takes pride in his margarita recipe. Good company at the bar. Chips included with delicious spice sprinkled on, salsa, and bean dip. HH started at 2 and featured $3.50-$4 ritas and $5 apps. Can't wait to order some food next time!"}
{"text":"12/28/11 DINNER.

One of the single worst meals I've had in my entire life on this planet.

Went with spouse.

We started off with each of us ordering a $15 \"large ultimate margarita\". They ask you to call your tequila, I said \"Herradura\", but to tell you the truth, there is so much mixer in the drink, why bother? They might as well simply offer them with the cheapest booze in the well and charge you less for them. By the end of the drink, and dinner, I felt little to no buzz from a very large glass of cocktail.

Spouse ordered a 3-item combo with a salad to start. The combo, one tamale, one taco, one chile relleno, was $16. The added salad was $3. $19 total. Ridiculous.

I ordered the \"enchilada de Cangrejo\", AKA their \"New Mexican\" crab enchiladas. That single plate of food, 2 rolled tortillas with god-knows-where-it-came-from crab (Lake Las Vegas?), rice (which I didn't eat, cuz it was one of the worst versions I've ever tried) and beans (that tasted burnt, so I didn't eat them either) was $17. $17? Again, ridiculous.

So ALL I ate were some chips, some salsa (which was sad), some bean dip (which was acceptable), two SUPPOSEDLY New-Mexican sauced (there was no heat or flavor) rolls of crab and cheese. That's it, for (with tax/tip) $35 for my portion of the meal.

Now, I eat everything. I am not a snob nor \"food challenged\", I love most food put in front of me. And I NEVER get ill from food, unless food poisoning (maybe 6 times in 55 years?) is involved.

Well, I was sick with indigestion for nearly 24 hours after this meal.

Yet ANOTHER strike-out for Mexican food in Las Vegas Valley. And this was a MAJOR fail."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 25 years, love the good & super authentic, great service and easy location to get to in a nice clean neighborhood"}
{"text":"Been coming here many years.  Never had a problem.  Food is some of the best in town.  Serving staff has always been attentive to us.   Great times and food.   Some people are just crazy on here I don't know.  Treat people with respect and they give it right back."}
{"text":"So, Coyote's is your basic Mexican restaurant.  It is certainly nothing special, but I have never had food that I didn't enjoy. I generally ONLY come here because my sister LOVES the place.  With that said....

Two good things about Coyote's:

1 - they serve both salsa and bean dip with your chips (something not every place does).

2 - they have a brand new happy hour menu with roughly 10 cheap appetizer options.   I believe this new happy hour goes from 2 - 5pm."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great chips and bean dip! Food came out quick and was very tasty. We will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. I've been in Vegas for almost 2 years and I couldn't find a good Mexican food restaurant. I will return. This was the best Mexican food I have had since Ive moved here."}
{"text":"Tasted like cheap cafeteria food. The sopapilla didn't taste like anything except warm bread."}
{"text":"This place was ok. No this isnt going to be my new favorite mex rest. To be honest I was here since we had flipped a coin btwn Enzo's (across the street) and bc Enzo's wasnt open yet we came here. 
I was torn btwn the lunch fajitas $11.99 or the Crab enchiladas $16.99.  the regular order of fajitas was $17.99 (for 1) wow. ok. 
I went w/ the lunch order - and it came out less than 5 min. later. on a regular plate - not sizzling on the skillet like they do at any other restaurant I've ever been to and ordered enchiladas. 

I hoped my dissapointment didnt show too much b/c I've been known to show a \"cara\" when I get sad. It was 1/2 a plate of onions w/  4 slivers of fajita meat. 1/2 cup of rice and 1/2 beans. I'm glad the portions were that small so that I wouldnt eat too many calories @ lunch - but I know I'd never order that plate again. The meat was good (for the most part) but since there wasnt that much to judge, its easy to say it was good. 

SALSA: CAN you say PACE? it was sweet and gross. 

BEANS: the bean dip did taste good and surprisingly really good and authentic. how ironic.  usually the salsa tastes great and the beans are runny , however here the salsa sucked. 

SERVICE: VERY attentive. kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila, drinks, (at 11 am) beer, margaritas, dessert? anything? I hate trying to be upsold. If I said no 3x , you suggesting everything else on your menu isnt going to make me change my mind all of a sudden. maybe he knew b/c I didnt finish my plate that I left still kinda hungry. In all fairness Viva Michoacan is around the corner and is around hte same price bracket or lower - and tastes way better."}
{"text":"We went to Coyote's for lunch after seeing a movie at Galaxy.  It was larger than I was expecting, I saw an occupancy sign that said 220.  The booths were spacious and comfortable.  We didn't venture far into the restaurant, or to the restrooms, but what we saw was very clean.  Our drink order was taken very quickly, and our chile con queso came out quickly as well.  This is made with real cheese, no processed stuff here.  You can tell because when you tried to get it onto your chip, it left LONG strings of cheese back to the bowl.  This made eating a little difficult, but we loved it.  Not a lot of places near us have queso this good, we'll definitely return to get some more.  It could use more heat, but I generally think that, so I don't knock a star off for failure to make something hot enough.

We each had a lunch special, my wife had the crab enchilada, and I had the Zarape, which is basically a large flour tortilla stuff with chopped fajita beef and topped with red and green sauce.  As per usual, I liked the green sauce better.  If I got this dish again, I would ask for all green sauce.  I thought the meat was very good, it was completely cooked, no pink whatsoever.  So, it was overcooked for my tastes.  But, it had good flavor.  I understand it's the lunch portion, but I feel like I had a lot of bites that were just tortilla and cheese, no meat. 

The rice and beans were good, I'd say above average for those typically served with an equivalent Mexican dish.  Also, as I looked through the rest of the menu, the prices seemed high for this type of establishment.  I certainly enjoyed my lunch, and would return to Coyote's, but some of the dinners seemed to be a few dollars higher than I would expect at a similar restaurant for the same dish."}
{"text":"Ok we've been going here for 12 years now. Best beef fajitas I have ever had anywhere in my life! No one ever has come close to how good theirs are period! Service is great they remember us every time we go in so we feel so welcomed.  we don't even need menus anymore! Margaritas are potent and so good! Chips, beans, and salsa are always fresh and great, they really keep them coming. Love love love this place! The owner and manager are just good guys all around. Go and order the beef fajitas, amazing!"}
{"text":"Would not even give this restaurant one star! The worst Mexican food I have ever had. The food had absolutely no taste, and the plate was drowning in cheese. Disgusting. Similar to what another reviewer wrote, the beef tastes like the beef from Taco Bell. In fact, Taco Bell has better Mexican food than this restaurant.

The prices are also absolutely ridiculous. Have not seen prices this high in all of Las Vegas. They really need to lower their prices if they expect to have customers!

Lastly, the service was horrible. After taking a drink order or giving us our check, the waiter would disappear for 20 minutes.

Overall, a huge disappointment, and now I have a horrible stomach ache from the disgusting food.

Thanks Coyotes!"}
{"text":"I would really like to give this a better rating but, well, here goes...

Got out for a rare date with Hubby and found Coyotes.  The interior's decor made us feel that it was a promising place, and the vibe overall was decent.  The menu prices were a bit more than we would have liked but we figured that the food must be good to shell out those pretty pennies.

Service was very courteous, and prompt.  We received our food less than fifteen minutes after ordering.  Impressive.  But a few bites in and that feeling quickly faded.  The chicken in my enchiladas was abnormally salty, and its texture was just blah.  The tortillas they were wrapped in made me think of runny oatmeal so I quickly lost interest.  Hubby's plate was just as disappointing so the meal portion of our evening was a bust.

The host and servers were nothing short of gracious so if I were only rating my experience with them the stars would be plentiful.  Unfortunately, this is a 'never' on my list."}
{"text":"We have finally found our favorite Mexican restaurant since moving here last November. We had tried a few other well-rated Mexican restaurants in the area & just weren't impressed, but now the search is over! We just bought an entertainment book & I was excited to see the coupon in there b/c Coyote's was next on our to-try list.

We went on a Tuesday & there were a few tables occupied but not many which is to be expected on a Tuesday. We were seated right away & immediately given warm tortilla chips with salsa & bean dip. My DH & kids devoured the bean dip & I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa. In fact, I need to call them & find out if they will sell me a container, it was that good. 

The menu was extensive & I had quite a hard time deciding. My hubby usually always orders a combo plate & after asking our waitress for suggestions, he decided on a Chile Relleno & Chicken Burrito combo ($12.99) He was served an enormous plate of food & said he was glad he only ordered a 2-item combo & not 3! The burrito was filled with melt in your mouth chicken that had been cooked in a verde sauce. The chile relleno was one of the biggest I'd seen & although the breading was a little too thick for my taste, it was still really good & extra-spicy, just the way I like it! 

I finally decided on the Chicken & Steak Fajitas ($17.49-ish.. can't remember the exact price) since I wasn't really in the mood for anything too saucy or covered in cheese. They were some of the best fajitas I've ever had. The seasoning was perfect & the portion was huge! I brought half home for today's lunch. mm mm mm I really liked that they served it with plenty of veggies, it's one of my favorite things about fajitas. Sometimes you get fajitas & it's mostly meat & hardly any veggies. Not so at Coyote's. 

Our waitress, Flavia (sp?) was very friendly & explained to us that they were a family run business that had been around for 20 years & that everything is homemade, down to the tortilla chips. I really like that in a business & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite traditional Mexican restaurant. Literally their recipes taste just like grandmas used to. My family and I have been coming here since I was a preteen, now I have a preteen and am still taking my family here. The staff is great, it's a Cheers feel where everyone knows your name and order. The food is always fresh and exactly what you are craving. The Botanitas appetizer is enough to fill you but a great variety, love their tamales, carnitas and sopapillas!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food is not. The rice had zero flavor. In fact most of it had none unless you add your own. Way overpriced and not authentic."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  i've been here many times and i've never had to wait to be seated.  the service is always good and very friendly.  they give you complimentary chips and salsa and hot bean dip.  

coyotes has been in town forever and its not a fancy place... it's low key and delicious.  i've tried many dishes there and everything is great... my favorite dish there is the chicken tortilla soup... it has just the right amount of spice and flavor and the tortillas are not mush, it's just perfect!  must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Family owned for many years. Great food and great old school vibe. Love the chips with bean dip! The food is delicious and the restaurant is SO CLEAN."}
{"text":"WHAT?! No!

Friends and I went to Coyotes for the first time in over decade because we had a coupon. Last time I had eaten here I was in high school and only had a vague recollection of it. We arrived a little before 7pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant side was about half full and I dont recall any other tables arriving after us. 

After taking quick drink orders our server disappeared. It literally took over 20 minutes for her to come back and take our food order. When our food arrived she had forgotten some of the sides (sour cream, guacamole) we had ordered so we had to ask for them again. As for the food... it was dismal. I ordered a chicken taco which came in a \"deep fried shell\". What it actually arrived in was a shell that was so fried it was burnt on the edges, yet the bottom half was not fried and soft (also incredibly soggy from the shredded chicken), so soft in fact the whole thing fell apart when I tried to take the first bite. I ended up eating the insides with a fork. The margaritas were also disappointing. We ordered margaritas on the rocks and they came watery with no ice.

The worst part of the whole experience was easily the service. Towards the end of eating the staff made it clear that they wanted us to finish so they could leave. They repeatedly came to our table asking if we were done. They took my friends drink while she was in the bathroom without even asking if she was finished. They came over with a bus tub and sat it on the table, reached for our plates and asked if we were done while we were in mid-bite. They started loudly cleaning and sweeping all around us because we were the last ones there. By this time it wasnt even 8pm yet on a Saturday night! It was SO RUDE and awkward that we ended up just asking for the bill and three employees sat there staring at me as I signed the credit card slip, just waiting for us to leave.

I would never ever visit Coyotes again based on this experience."}
{"text":"Busy for late evening, Friday night. Good margarita on the rocks, rim with plenty of salt, twangy lemon lime cold but not too much ice, a more perfect drink if I had made it!

Order half nachos for app, layer of beans first then tossed with beef, chips melted cheese sour cream and guacamole jalopenos pica de gallo.

Burrito chili verde soft tender generous portions of pork, smothered in chili verde sauce and melted cheese. Very good flavors. 

Service good friendly and fast good food"}
{"text":"Recently visited here for my mom's birthday, and even though I am not a fan of Mexican food, I was impressed by my meal. My favorite part was the salsa and bean dip they give you for your chips at the beginning of the meal. The salsa was fresh, and mixing with bean dip was an interesting combination that ended up being super delicious. Our waiter was also very quick to refill our chips whenever we ran low. I ordered the chimichanga with shredded beef, and was surprised at how massive (and greasy) it was. I couldn't finish the entire thing, especially since I ate so many chips  before ;~) For dessert, I ordered the flan and was super satisfied with it. 
My only complaint was how pricey the meals were. While the food was good, I do not think it was worth the price they put it at. 
Overall, it was a decent meal and I look forward to coming back and trying something new."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Had lunch here today. Menu has good lunch specials. I had the chicken tamale with rice and beans for $9.99. The portion was huge and I ended up taking half of it home. You also get free bottomless chips with salsa and bean dip. The salsa was very good! Our waiter was very friendly and always present! He even made a few jokes and treated every one in the dining area as welcomed guests! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"This place opened when I was in high school... it was a family favorite then.. and now that I'm back in town it's a family favorite now!!! The food and service are excellent... the fantastic waiter even gave me an iced tea to go... you don't see service like this anymore..."}
{"text":"Lunch was crazy expensive without any alcoholic drinks $40. Food came out, not what we ordered and It was lukewarm. The chicken was suppose to be shredded, it was just simply chunked and gross. I liked the salsa, that was it.  Not sure what happened to this place. It was once an awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is good and the margaritas are great. Had a large frozen strawberry margarita and a chili verde burrito. You won't go hungry with this meal. Lots of food. The rest of our party had everything from the shredded beef chimichanga to the chicken quesadilla and it was all muy bueno. The downside was we wanted to order more margaritas and dessert, but they told us they were closing early because they were slow. It's always disappointing when you want to order more, but the restaurant is closing an hour early."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a really long time. This place has been in Green Valley longer than any other place I think. It was just terrible.The walls are a dingy yellow, with plaster repair spots all over. The plastic holder on our table was so dirty it stuck to my fingers, and you could hardly read through it. I ordered the crab enchilladas. They used mealy ground up canned crab meat that tasted like crap. Stale old rice and beans. None of the food at our table looked good, my friends said it was OK. There are many mexican places in town, I won't be coming back here. The best part of the meal was the margarita, large is $13, no thanks."}
{"text":"Good little Mexican cantina. The carne asada tacos are phenomenal.  The servers are great and very friendly."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's got a really cozy feel to it and the food is yummy. Pretty standard Mexican fare, nothing stands out as being exceptional, but it's all tasty and comforting."}
{"text":"Went to Coyotes cafe for lunch today.. Wow it was expensive even with a coupon.  The food was good  but not great, the nacho chips with beans and salsa was the best part.  I will go back but only if I have BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"Really nice people but the food was very bland and not worth coming back for. I had the steak fajitas, my boyfriend had a beef tamale and beef taco, and my mom had a chicken burrito. We were all disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, my husband and I come from Phoenix AZ, and absolutely LOVE Mexican food! Also we moved to NY for awhile so we have been LOVING the Mexican food!! Because they don't have it where we were in NY, so we have tried plenty of places around us here in Henderson! So my husband saw coyotes and said let's try it, ok, his Fav is Albondigas soup! But it has to be where the meatballs are whole made, and when we called they said they were! So I love chili reillno, and so I called and ordered a LARGE soup to go with xra meatballs and a chili reillno plate to go with a bag of Chips and a large salsa to go!! So when we get it, there's a small water cup which is the soup and there is 4 meatballs in it!!! SMDH!! The cup didn't even fit a small soup bowl let alone a large and when I called the owner said there should have been 5 meatballs in a large soup! Plus I paid for xtra! # never got!!!! And the chips were NEVER Fresh like a normal Mexican restaurant! And my chili reillno SUCKED!! PLEASE save your money!! Honestly the Roberto's on pecos and sunset is Soooooooo much better and worth the money!! I just spent 30$ for NOTHING!!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Mexican food and thought of this place! I appreciate the whole in the wall feel and great food. We arrived on a Saturday night, around 6:30-7pm, well after the dinner rush, however they were still pretty busy. We were initially told it could be up to a 25 minute wait and decided to stick it out. Glad we waited since it actually only ended up being 10 minutes or so. Our drink orders were taken and brought to our table promptly along with chips, salsa and bean dip. All waiters and runners were really pleasant. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. They were presented in the typical sizzling skillet fashion which printed states from the entire restaurant, piled on top sauted peppers and onions. Rice, refried beans and the fajita toppings were served on a separate plate along with flour tortillas. I was happy with my meal choice and I received more than enough food to fill me, which made my husband happy since he got to enjoy some of the shrimp as well."}
{"text":"The decor is very well put together. Their chips and salsa are tasty, however, I would prefer unseasoned chips.

For the size of the portions and the (lack of) quality of ingredients, this place is way overpriced.

$3 for a soda?! 

$15.99 for a taco and two enchiladas filled with dry, tough, chicken, reminiscent of Dinty Moore or dog food.

There are too many other Mexican restaurants in town for a greater value. That being said, we won't be partaking in their menu again."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever! When I originally moved to Vegas, I lived around the corner from this restaurant and my Mom and I ate there. That was 14 years ago! I was surprised to see that they are still going strong, but I shouldn't be because the food is solid.

We met friends at Coyote's before heading to see the cactus garden and Ethel M's recently. There were 4 adults, 2 infants and a toddler and the restaurant had no problems accommodating us.

I was starving and got a little crazy when I ordered. I went with the 3 item combo ordering a cheese enchilada, chile relleno and beef taco. There was so much food that my rice and beans were served on a 2nd plate. Now, this isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it was good. The prices are reasonable and the service was fast and friendly. Their chips and salsa were on point and that bean dip is addicting!

Overall, it was a great experience and I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Just moved to the Las Vegas Valley and tried Coyote's for the first time a few weeks ago after a round of golf. We love this place. The staff is super friendly, efficient, quick with warm chips, salsa and beans for an appetizer. Yum! Our order was taken quickly and the food was delivered hot. My husband is very picky about his food being delivered hot and he was very happy with the results. The food was tasty and delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and shredded beef enchiladas with double rice (not a beans person sorry) all were excellent choices will be back. Ole'"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Was way overpriced for the quality of food. Beans and rice were just okay. Meat was over-seasoned. My son's 5 inch cheese and tortilla quesadilla was 5.99 and came with no drink, no beans and no rice. It was not enough food for him at all. It was insulting to be honest. The least the waitress could have done was warned us that it wasn't very big since my son was height of an 8 year old. I wasn't impressed at all. We will not be coming back, that is for sure."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous!  We have lived in Vegas for 6 years now and we recently went to Coyotes for the first time a couple weeks ago.  The food was very good, the service was wonderful and if you are into drinking margaritas, their house margarita was very good for the price.

We moved to Las Vegas from California 6 years ago and we have not been able to find what we think has been a restaurant that meets the high standards of Mexican restaurants in California.  After eating at Coyotes, we think we have finally found that restaurant.

If you like Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Coyotes!  We will be going back over and over."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a couple of times, mostly for Happy Hours. They have great margarita's, in a wide variety of flavors...mango, peach, coconut, strawberry, etc etc. Some of the best margarita's in town. 

The food is very good too, although its not what most would call \"authentic\". It is well prepared and large portioned. I do think its a little bit expensive, hence the happy hour margarita's to offset the price!!

I've ordered the carne asada tacos, which were very good, but the carne asada lacked the full flavor of carne asada I've had other places. I've also had the beef tostada, which was huge and good, but again...lacking the kick and flavors you might find in more authentic places. 

They have a small bar area with gaming, and a couple of dining areas. Service is very good....friendly and fast. 

tl:dr - Margarita's are delicious!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been going to Coyotes for 7 years now.  In our opinion they have the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  We have tried a lot around town and keep coming back for more.  I'm not sure what they do with their chips and salsa, but we can't stop eating it.  Every visit we have had has been excellent from the wait staff to the food.  I could ask for a better restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Food was very great like normal. Slow night last Sunday. The service was very good and made sure that we had everything we needed. Been going here for a long time glad that it has lasted. See you again soon. Thanks"}
{"text":"We hadn't been at Coyote's in a year, but since we were in Henderson, we thought we'd try it out again.   Service was good, the busser kept our water glasses full and chips and salsa coming.  We ordered the shrimp enchiladas and crab meat enchiladas.  Neither left me wanting for more.  I don't believe \"real\" shrimp or crab was used but flavored fish.  The flavor was not that of shrimp or crab.   The sauce on the enchiladas was just ok, nothing flavorful or that I would want to order again.  Side of guacamole, again, was jut mediocre.  Traditional rice and beans finished the plate....again ok.  Hopefully other munu items are more flavorful, as the ones we tasted would not bring us back for a return visit anytime soon.  Prices seemed to be more costly than most Mexican restaurants we frequent.  A simple bottle of beer was $4.75."}
{"text":"Never have I been left with such a churning in my stomach. I had eaten at Coyotes only once before. To my surprise, it was better than I had expected. Recently, I went on another venture to this restaurant only with an extremely different experience. Not only were the prices ridiculous, the place looked like a ghost-town. I cannot stand when I go to a restaurant and there are no other people. Not to mention the fact that I nearly couldn't make it to school the next morning. I would recommend this joint if you wish to have a legitimate reason for missing work. If, however, you are looking for tasty Mexican food, you are looking at the wrong place."}
