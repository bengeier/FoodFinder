{"text":"Petros is a great addition to the neighbourhood. The food was delicious and  the staff was very friendly. The octopus is excellent."}
{"text":"J'y étais pour l'anniversaire de graduation des étudiants de la faculté de droit de l'Université McGill de 1987.  Les entrées, le repas, les desserts et le service ont été appréciés de tous. La nourriture était bonne et abondante et le personnel très courtois. Je retournerais sans hésiter à ce gentil petit restaurant qui sert une cuisine grecque authentique!"}
{"text":"Awsome restaurant and delicious greek food. Tried the moussaka, the salmon, calamari, lamb.. and the desert was sooo delicious.The service is very good also!"}
{"text":"Je saurais dire si le repas était bon. Jamais réussi à manger ici. Ils ont bousiller la réservation, pas de nourriture, pas de solution, je ne serai pas de retour. À éviter."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day so we wanted to sit outside on the terrace. Location is great in Wsmnt. We arrived and was seated immediately outside. I loved how they brought us toasted crusty bread with oil and balsamic, yummy! We had a few starters , Greek salad which was refreshing. Really can't go wrong with that but the Tzatziki was quite bland. As for my main meal I had the Pork souvlaki,  it was over cooked and dry! The wait time from the starters to the main meal was much to long. It took about 20-25 minutes to wait for my main meal which by then I was not hungry anymore! I definitely think it has potential thou!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money in this place!it was a horrible experience that cost me 70$ for frozen calamari that were supposed to be fresh and grilled they arrived boiled and served with an acid sauce!Main course was a little piece of salmon that was practically burnt served with one piece of potato and 2 pieces of green peppers!!! 70$ I can do much better at home!"}
{"text":"The are a plethora of Greek restaurants in Montreal  owing to the City's large and vibrant Greek population ( the word Plethora derives from a Greek root meaning fullness).  We happen to pass by the  Le Petros which is located on one of the least busiest parts of Blvd Notre Dame. Although there were no Yelps we decided to give it a try.   Most Greek restaurants -that are not Souvlaki Joints- have very similar menus so how does one differentiate among them? For me it comes down to atmosphere, food quality, and value. Petros has a nice atmosphere. It's  a very small dining space, maybe 40 seats, that is reminiscent of the Greek homeland without being overly sentimental or touristy. And unlike many of the more expensive Greek restaurants in town there were no white table cloths. As we were seated we thought might have come across a a \"real find\".  The offerings of Le Petros were posted on a big blackboard where we found a nice selection of the usual Greek menu items. We were somewhat surprised that the prices for the main courses were very high. The lowest item was $38 for Greek chicken and some of the seafood items were in the $50 range. There was however a notice on the blackboard that for $15 you can share your plates.  Despite  the menu being  somewhat confusing and the waiter not very effective in explaining all the options, we  managed to order a nice meal consisting of a Greek salad, a fine plate of Greek dip's and toasted pita bread which included colorfully tasty Taramosalta, Red Pepper Feta , Egglplant, and Tzaziki.  Our main plate of grilled Swordfish was served with a nice array of  string beans and roasted potatoes. The  fish was very fresh and expertly cooked and it was just enough for the two of us to share.  A complimentary plate of some tastes of desserts was brought to the table and was a nice touch. If you have a big appetite or you are a power eater you would need to order another main dish. That is for one per person to walk out with a real feeling of fullness.  The service was friendly enough although a little bit out of step which was surprising because it was a Sunday night and there were only eight people in the room. Its an open kitchen and the staff seemed pre-occupied by their smartphones.  So bottom line is there isn't enough difference here to place  Le Petros anywhere out of the ordinary and you may as well go to go to one of fancier \"white table cloth\" Greek restaurants where you'll pay about the same."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for Petros, mostly because my name in greek is Petros.   The location and decor are both amazing and I really like the entrance area before walking into the main restaurant. It is a bit crowded depending where you are seated and since it is just one long seating area noise travels a lot. The service was great for us. I read that it was a problem for others but our waiter was superb.   *Full disclosure* as a Greek I expect a lot from Greek restaurants, especially when the prices are on the higher end side.   We started off with fried zucchini and some tzatziki. The zucchini was okay not overly oily like some other restaurants I've tried. The tzatziki however wasn't thick like it should be. Traditional Tzatziki is made with only greek yogurt so it should have a thick consistency, many restaurants substitute part of the greek yogurt for sour cream because it is cheaper. I expect it from Marathons and cheap greek fast food places but I for more upscale greek restaurant they should have 100% greek yogurt tzatziki.   For the main course I ordered Moussaka and a side order of fries. Moussaka is a traditional Greek dish kind of like a lasagna but substitute the pasta for eggplant and potatoes. And then the cheese for béchamel sauce. It's my favourite Greek dish hands down. The portion was massive and honestly it was pretty good. They used lamb meat instead of beef which gives it an interesting taste and the potatoes eggplant and zucchini weren't over cooked and mushy, something that often happens. It was a bit on the salty side but all in all best part of the meal.   As for the fries, they were good but came cold which was disappointing.   For desert we had a few loukoumades which were on the doughy side, rather than being light and fluffy.   To sum it up, there are a lot of better Greek restaurants at half the price, so it will be difficult to justify a return visit to Petros."}
{"text":"The best that can be said for Petros is that eating there is like a comedy skit.  There were 4 of us for dinner. Our waiter brought me the wrong appetizer, then argued with the 4 of us at the table saying we had made a mistake. Then he forgot my main course and again argued that the mistake was ours. Of the 2 main course orders for lamb, both were overcooked, even though our erstwhile server had asked how we wanted them cooked. It may be useful for this guy to carry a pencil and pad to take orders as he seems unable to remember what guests actually want. The  best part of our meal was the charcoal toasted bread , green olives and oil served at the outset. With the one missing main course,  dinner , ordered for 4, and delivered for 3, was $165 ( ( would have been over $200 if we had gotten what we ordered.)  Neither the only average quality of the food nor the absurdly poor service justify such prices. We will never return."}
{"text":"BYOW. This is a nice restaurant with table on the main floor and a lower level. Ambiance is nicer on main level but is still ok below. The food was good and so was the service. Prices were highish for what they offer. I would go back but nothing spectacular. The best part is that because it's a bring your own wine it brings the whole experience up."}
{"text":"It is ok. Nice ambience and very good service. Food ok, a bit bland. Don't think I would go back because  expensive. Value not quite there. There are better Greek fish restaurants at this price point."}
{"text":"I tried this place with hesitation, due to the below average reviews online, but because I liked their other location when I was last in town.  Unfortunately, it was a mistake.  I should've trusted the reviews.  First off, my friend called and spoke to the owner to make the reservation.  When we arrived, we were not in the books.  This is the second time this has happened to her, and I was there for both of them.  No excuse.  The service was extremely slow and the food arrived cold.  Really cold.  It's a shame because it really has potential.  It's a great location, lovely little place and decent prices.  The taste of the food wasn't bad, but being extremely slow and ice cold will not keep them in business here for long.  Many restaurants have come and gone in this location.  They better get it together soon, or they will be gone too."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant and when I finally tried it , I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to what I had heard. However, this is not to say it was a bad experience overall , it is just not my favourite , especially with such great greek food options in montreal that are alot less expensive. So first off, the decor inside is actually very nice and has a nice atmosphere , with lots of seating without feeling like you are crowded in, even though the restaurant was full to capacity, so that was nice. (Great for large groups , but even if you are just two, definitely make a reservation). Another positive point was that service was outstanding , they didnt miss a beat and were so friendly and attentive to all the tables and really make you feel welcome. The food itself tasted fresh and wasnt bad but It was definitely overpriced.  We started with the assortment of greek dips (which was way overpriced for what you get and does not come with Pita to dip into it , which was odd to me), the dips were not bad , their Tzatziki was solid though (very good job on the Tzatziki!). We also had the spanakopita to share and that was absolutely delicious ! The main meals were less impressive. My boyfriend had the lamb chops with veggies but he said they really lacked alot in flavour and really didnt stand out. I had the Moussaka , which was not too bad , it had more going in the way of flavour but was definitely not he best I have had. Both main dishes tasted like the ingredients were fresh and prepared with care but the problem was more in terms of not enough flavour and that the prices were kind of high for what you are getting. However, what does help to make up for the prices is that this place is a bring your own wine so thats nice to be able to do that. I would encourage anyone to go and try this out for themselves though as it may just be a matter if opinion."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service and food are great but the prices are way too high. A small order of calamari is way too much."}
{"text":"Good experience at Retros.  We are fans of Greek fish restaurants and frequently visit three different ones in the city.  Retros ranks well amongst them.  The place is awesome, although not suitable for a romantic dinner as it is a friendly, active place.  The waiter and service were excellent.  Bread service with three types of toasted breads - nice.  Good salad with great feta cheese - better than most.  The waiter suggested only half portions of salad and zucchini chips which we appreciated.  The chips were crispy and not oily.  Plate of beans we ordered were excellent.  Sea Bass topped it all of and was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Can't ask for much better!  Passed on dessert as the food was more than ample."}
{"text":"I wonder why there isn't an option to give negative (-1) stars but this would be a fair case study of it.  New Year's Eve - my family (total of 7 people) made the unfortunate mistake of selecting petros as our destination. I was against it. I've visited many restaurants both in Montreal and abroad...but family decided so I capitulated.  There is no decent or fair or acceptable reason to serve microwave moussaka and change what? $25 -$27 dollars a for it?  How do I know? Ask your waiter who felt horrible doing so. Boiling hot outside, frozen meat inside...yup.  Then what ? Yes $18 for oily soft, cold fried zucchini. Maybe this was a rare imported zucchini from the rain forest or simply a sad way of getting extra $ from trusting customers  Seriously- whomever may respond, location is great, concept is great, decor is fun. Be honest and turn this to a proper place to eat..."}
{"text":"Pretty good place... nice ambiance & decor. Plates are flavourful but not very big. On the pricey side. Service is good. Cool location in Westmount. Most importantly: its bring your own wine!!!    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.Nice location,lovely terrace. Staff are friendly but a bit inefficient.   Food..as per other reviews, its ok but uninspired. Starters tried...taramasalata is excellent, grilled mushrooms are quite good but a bit bland, hit them with some oil and fresh lemon. Fried zucchini is ok...first time they were totally limp,most recently they were crispy but totally bland like the mushrooms, no seasoning at all. Main courses...the fish, grilled Porgy is consistently very good, grilled to perfection and nicely seasoned.The grilled lambchops were pretty awful, stay away from them, it appears the chef really has no ability to cook lamb well. I asked for them to be cooked rose but they came blue, even the waiter said they were blue not rose,completely raw and zero seasoning, absolutely no flavour. What was kind of shocking was Chesterman in her Gazette  review of the place a few days earlier had the exact same problem with her lamb...obviously they didn't bother to use her review as a learning experience. Lastly, even though the lamb was totally improperly cooked and inedible, no offer was made for any kind of discount or complimentary dessert etc. I would eat here again but I can only recommend the taramasalata, porgy  and maybe the greek salad. Btw...I noticed that another table had to send their grilled shrimp plate ( 4 shrimp for $36) back for further grilling."}
