{"text":"On a blistering cold day all I wanted was a big bowl of tasty carbs. Etsu certainly delivered on the carbs, less so on the tasty.   I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with tofu. From what I can tell neither the tofu nor the beef versions come up with a fried egg (??!!!?!) which may have explained much of the lack of flavour. The tofu was deep fried and bland, the veg were fine but did I mention it was bland?? Stone bowl was appropriately hot and the rice crisped up nicely.   Service was very attentive and quick. Didn't try the Japanese side of the menu but other people got Bento boxes and rolls which look good.   One highlight though: they serve homemade ginger ice cream which was a surprising and tasty dessert.  Most of the lunch specials are $8.99 which is on the upper end of lunch specials, but the whole experience didn't leave me feeling ripped off. I would =pass on coming here again and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"After reading all the wonderful reviews on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try. First impression was nice, clean, small and cosy. The service was okay but nothing outstanding. My main complaint was with the food. I ordered the sashimi meal where it was well over $10 for a selection of 10 tiny pieces of raw fish (not very generous with their portion sizes) which tasted very bland and chewy. Their maki rolls had too much rice in them which gave it a bit of a dry texture so it wasn't the melt in your mouth kind of sushi. The only highlight for me here was their tempura appetizer which came out with a nice variety of vegetables that were deep fried and came out super crunchy. Conclusion: If you are expecting a true Japanese experience then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"In between classes I decided to grab something to eat with my sister and since there's only fast food places near Con Hall at UofT I decided to yelp for a nearby restaurant. Several places came up under Baldwin village so we headed there for a new adventure. Oh, what a cute little street it was!  I was already doubting Etsu when I saw the flowing fish thingy at the front of the restaurant but we entered anyway. I'm a big fan of sushi but I decided to go safer with their teriyaki which I absolutely loved. It was 'good' different. Their homemade teriyaki sauce was sauteed in onions and sizzling on top of my chicken (never had it like that before, yum!). The rice was neat too, it was purple ( because of the beans and other veggies) but it was actually very tasty.  The place was really nice also, with the glass chairs/tables and awesome art.   What I liked most was their use of original pieces, like actual chopsticks and decorative cups. Their green tea was also flavored, you know the ones that smell like flowers? (I think it's jasmine) Anyway, it was lovely!  I felt that they really gave their customers a fancy and warm meal for a cheap price. When I went there the second time I ordered my fave- spicy tuna roll. It was delish and about 6 bucks as I recall (dinner price). They give you ice cream at the end too with cute heart-shaped spoons.  Oh! and the waiters are dressed up in traditional outfits too which made the evening so much more interesting.   Will definitely go there again :)"}
{"text":"I only came here for lunch so I can only speak to the lunch menu. Etsu is a clean, stylish restaurant with waitstaff in full costume, even at lunch--which comes off a bit odd considering. Lunch bentos are good, although I found nothing really remarkable about them. There is a half and half mix of Korean and Japanese selections on the lunch menu. My colleague complained his Korean dish was somewhat flavorless, but still liked it."}
{"text":"When an Etsu deal showed up on Travelzoo, I was excited. It's closeby and convenient for good, but not mind-blowing, Japanese food. I forwarded the e-mail to a couple friends and purchased one for myself. Time flew, as it tends to do, and I found myself on the last day of the deal. Busy all day, I finally got there around 9:30pm. I called a friend to come with; he said he'd think about it and call back.  I politely asked if I could use the voucher afterwards, as it was late, I wasn't hungry, I couldn't find physical nor phone inbox voucher, and had no one to eat with anyways. They said no. I rushed home to search for it (it was one of those days where everything possible goes wrong, first world problems. Internet was still on the blink, which is why I didn't have a reprint in the first place.) I finally found the voucher, rushed back, and sat down to choose from only four offered meal combinations; that was okay. But when I tried to order two, the owner came over, gruffly said it was for dine-in only and asked if another person was coming. At this point I wasn't sure, but I was somewhat put off--I had paid for two dinners; should I not be able to have both of them regardless of how many people are present? What if I was just super-voracious and wanted two dinners to myself? He was quite rude and made me feel unwelcome. This was not AYCE, it was a set portion prix-fixe, yet he seemed to say I couldn't take any of it home. My friend came out of pity for my plight. So much for customer service.  The waitress was lovely, but there's only so much you can do when the big boss is calling the shots. Their salmon sushi pizza was amazing. I accidentally ordered chicken teriyaki because I forgot last time I sent back my yaki-tori (chicken on a skewer) as it was pretty inedible. I didn't complain this time, but for future reference this is NOT the place to go for chicken. I was looking forward to dessert; last time it was homemade gelato-like espresso ice cream and absolutely divine. I had a bite...Not espresso. My friend told me not to have any more because he felt he had a nut in his and I'm allergic. So not only was the owner extremely unsympathetic on a day when Murphy's Law had me by tenterhooks, but I also could have DIED having this chocolate pecan ice cream. Given the commonness of nut allergies these days, they should at least mention; lucky I'm not anaphylactic. Could have also done without the organ-on-steroids background music.  Etsu, I should add, is one of the most beautiful Japanese restaurants in the city. Up a small flight of stairs on Baldwin Street, past a charming little patio, one is immediately taken aback by the stark beauty of stunning photographs on large canvases, with a black and red theme, and they always seem to have a vase of fresh flowers. The little accoutrements are adorable and must have been brought over from Japan (ie. multi-coloured ceramic paper crane chopstick rests); bathrooms are clean. Once we went for a friend's birthday, and they gave her a little wrapped present: a heart-shaped spoon engraved \"Happy Birthday.\" So you can imagine my disappointment when this aesthetically-gorgeous neighbourhood standby turned out to be run by a cold and uncompromising owner.   There are several other amazing Japanese restaurants around. Less than half a year old, ND Sushi & Grill (also on Baldwin) has an extreme minimalist aesthetic, stunning plating presentation, and fresh, truly DELICIOUS, melt-in-your-mouth sashimi. Every single piece in the $19 chirashi bowl was exemplary. Dessert, a ginger lime creme brul√©e was, well, sublime. I used a voucher there as well and was not treated like a second-class citizen.   Aside from ND, there's also sweet little Konnichi-wa a couple doors east, wonderful Manpuku in Village by the Grange, immaculate Japango a couple minutes away on Elizabeth, yummy Ematei down St. Patrick, ramen-haven Kenzo on Dundas, and ever-impressive Guu just a bit further, on Church. All reasonably priced, even without a deal. Especially Manpuku, where $5 covers my meal and 20% tip (!!!)   Looks can only take you so far; Etsu needs to step up customer service. I'd be hard-pressed to return given this awful experience, coupled with the fact several quite amazing Japanese restaurants abound (and I only mentioned the ones that are superior to Etsu!) For the record, Guu makes the best chicken I've ever had: karaage, deep-fried boneless chicken, with mayo and a twist of lemon.   Ironically, the reason I got to Etsu so late is because I was watching a sushi documentary at the TIFF Bell Lightbox called Jiro Dreams of Sushi. So inspiring. The story of a three-star Michelin chef and his relentless drive for excellence. It really spoke to the Asian perfectionist in me. He's been a sushi chef for 75 years and still seeks to perfect his craft. If you've read my review this far, maybe you're a foodie freak like me and if so you should try to see this movie =)"}
{"text":"It's my second time here for lunch within a span of a month. It appears that they have increased the prices of their lunch specials I the new year as I only paid 13.50 last time and this time it was over $16. It's less of an impressive value for money now but the food is still great, portions are generous and ingredients are somewhat fresh. Beautifully plated, very artistic. They do season their sashimi with dressings, etc. so die hard sashimi purists may not like it as much. For me the fusion twist is novel and appreciated although I still prefer to have it the traditional way the majority of the time. Service and serving time was efficient, which makes it a good pick for a quick work lunch. I would return but now with the higher prices may be less frequently as I would have had otherwise."}
{"text":"They are great! The best place to start trying sushi.   I have tried this place since 2010. The food is great with a good amount and they decorate the meal beautifully. However, prices are not expensive in comparison to other places. The staff are very welcoming and they have tried to have an artistic atmosphere. I really enjoy the their taste in choosing beautiful classic songs.   My suggestions is \"giant roll set\" from the night menu. If you still hesitate to try sushi, go for chicken tempura box."}
{"text":"Clean, bustling and great interior, but  quality of the food is overhyped; it was nothing special. I expected better from the glowing reviews. Service is ok.  Good place for work lunch or casual date."}
{"text":"This restaurant says it opens from 11am to 11pm seven days of the week. Be aware. They actually open at 12:30pm on the weekends."}
{"text":"Best chirashi in town! Like many other Yelpers' reviews, highly recommend trying it out. My friends and I came here on Friday night and made RSVP beforehand to avoid wait time.  The sashimi was very fresh and had a variety included in the chirashi including some non traditional fishes/ seafoods. Just a note that one kind of fish/ seafood is spicy, so ask the server to opt out or change with another type if you are not big of spicy food. The rice they used is the japanese sticky rice and is not soggy. It is a couple dollars more than typical chirashi (~$20), but it is definitely worth every dollar. Dish also comes with standard salad and soup.  Service was great, although it did take a little bit for the food to arrive which wasn't a big issue. Can't wait to come back to try out other dishes!"}
{"text":"We came here as a group for a birthday. The food was excellent and lots of selection. Atmosphere and service was great. Would recommend this place for any special occassion, not an everyday place as it is $$$.   Overall, sushi was very high quality and lots of exotic drinks and desserts to choose from."}
{"text":"Really nice sushi place, I love their food presentation. The restaurant interior is nice and the service was very friendly - may be too friendly as the server tried to flirt with my husband when we were there on Saturday :-) I think it's really good value for the price, IMO this is one of the best sushi places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"3/5! Definitely had better sushi (I.e- ND sushi & Grill). Recommend the sweet shrimp seaweed dish, crush roll and beef wraps. Service is good but rolls are average."}
{"text":"Etsu is by far my favourite sushi place downtown.   Everything is always fresh and great tasting!  Always met with a smile and great service !!   Not to mention that prices are awesome for such fresh quality food! and how can you go wrong with a $30 bottle of Oyster Bay wine !!"}
{"text":"Elaborate deco, looked more like a bar other than a Japanese restaurant.the Lightning is really dark at night. I ordered chirashi. Better than I expected. Nice display. Many toppings. Nice rice. They got a the small thing other places didn't have. It will be awesome if they only charge it 13 during lunch time."}
{"text":"I took a friend to Etsu after reading lots of good reviews here. Was craving sushi for a while and it seemed like a good alternative to the existing and boring sushi offer in the city.  Service was good. The place feels clean, has nice glass tables and really cool & promising menus. We went for the sushi only - haven't tried their Korean part of the menu. Salmon sushi was satisfying. Rolls were just barely OK. (tried 4 different types). Far from that melting feeling in your mouth that always keeps you craving for more and more.   In the end we concluded that we could have the same amount and quality of food for a twice the less price in, let's say, New Gen. Maybe we wouldn't have the service, and the decent pair of chopsticks... but... for sushi I wouldn't come back here.  I know it sounds silly, but I don't like to pay 2$ for a tiny bowl of miso soup made from cheap powder...let's be real, in other places at least it comes for free as soon as you sit down and even with salad on top!   Oh, and the music was atrocious!! Doesn't have to be super-upbeat but please at least put something that won't make people asleep ;)"}
{"text":"Etsu has recently become our new favourite sushi place in downtown Toronto! I usually go there for lunch because it's close to work. Everything tastes fresh and amazing! The sushi is not just normal sushi that you'd get anywhere, it's a bit more fancier than standard sushi. The chefs usually use a torch to slightly sear the surface of the fish right before serving. It just makes everything taste the next level!"}
{"text":"So clean and trendy  restaurant.The shish and sashimi is really really fresh.And the food tastes very good and fantastic. The service is so good. The mood of restaurant  is merry and bright.I surely recommend this place from the bottom of my heart."}
{"text":"I've gone here a bunch of times for lunch. The prices were much better under the old management. Anyway, still a good deal. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They were ok to substitute certain rolls in a set as I'm a vegetarian. When I get takeout, they give me a cup of green tea while I wait which is a nice touch. The restaurant is very clean so no hygiene issues here.  The rolls are made fresh. You can see them making them so you know you're not getting anything that's been sitting around for a while.  Overall a great little place. I enjoy coming here now and then for dine in or take out lunch."}
{"text":"I went to Etsu today with a friend for lunch.  We were the only ones in the restaurant.  The waitress brought us the menus and after looking it over, we decided we wanted the summerlicious special.  The waitress told us that we were not allowed to order from that menu since we didnt have a reservation....what a joke.  Place is empty and they are treating customers this way, no wonder why it is empty.  So i told the waitress, i would like to make a reservation for now, she said that i could only make one for next time.  Needless to say the treatment of patrons was subpar.  The decor was very cheap looking.  The walls were covered with a brick wallpaper that was peeling off.  I finally decided on a ramen dish.  The food was ok, but nothing that stood out.  For all this hassle, i would rather go somewhere where my business is appreciated.  Lots of other japenese restaurants in baldwin village."}
{"text":"4.5 stars   The hunt for a new sushi place to call home took us to Etsu for Sunday night dinner. We were really impressed.  Our kimono-clad server was attentive, polite, friendly and even humored my SO as he practiced his Japanese on her. Our food came quickly, and was warm and delicious.   I had Vegetable Udon Soup which was pretty standard but good. my SO had Chicken Katsu Don which he enjoyed. We split an unassuming Hamachi Roll and his more ostentatious cousin, the Volcano Roll. (someone else has already shared a photo of it). The waitress actually giggled when she saw our expression.   The atmosphere and little details definitely receive bonus points. Nice, comfortable, clean with stylish tables and chairs. Finally NON-DISPOSABLE actual chopsticks (!!!!!) and little chopstick holders. Our table had little flower ohashi-oki's, the table next to us had little cranes. Solid, large tea cups with constant refills. Quality dishware.   Extra Bonus points for fun Japanese toilets, enormous Sushi Boats, and hand cream and mouthwash in the washrooms. Constant tea refills,  good service, good food.   Definitely elevated to go-to status. Yes our meal was $10 more than we used to pay, but it is well worth it. If you can make it here during lunch, the lunch specials were much better than anything in the Y&B neighborhood.  Too cold at the moment, but there is a cute patio."}
{"text":"UPDATE July 6 2014: We went back to Etsu for their Summerlicious lunch special. It seemed like a good deal, and it was. We were impressed with the appetizer (sashimi salad) and the main course sashimi/sushi/maki platter. Ice cream dessert was okay. For $15 it seemed like good value. So I'm increasing the rating up to 4 stars given the good service we received and the good food. I should mention that while we were there, a table came in, sat down, and tried to order from the Summerlicious menu without having a reservation. Even though there were several empty tables, the waitress (no doubt having been told by her boss) would not allow them to since they had no reservation. So the table eventually just left. To me this is misguided; why lose customers when the restaurant wasn't even full?  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I first came here with my girlfriend a few months ago, shortly after the change in ownership. It was a great experience so we went back today. We arrived around 11:30am, and even though the door was open, when we stepped inside the waitress told us that they're not open yet, they open at noon. Their website still says they open at 11am so they haven't bothered to change it yet. Okay, no problem, so we wander around the area for half an hour, and return around 12:10. We sit down and look at the menu, and quickly noticed that they no longer offer any sushi lunch specials like they used to on Saturdays. Now the only lunch specials they have on Saturdays are katsu options. It also seems like their prices have generally increased quite a bit since the last time we visited late last year. They waitress advised us that they got rid of the lunch specials \"four days ago.\" Bad luck for us?  Since they didn't offer any sushi specials and their prices were a lot higher than we expected, we decided to find a different place to eat. They didn't seem too concerned that we were leaving, although the waitress did apologize in a half-hearted way. We went down the street to ND Sushi and it was a good choice, they had sushi and sashimi lunch specials."}
{"text":"Just came back from a tasty lunch (special) here and I must say, I'm glad that there is now a reliable and not-so-pricey Japanese option in this area. Lunch specials are reasonably priced between $7-10 and offer both Japanese and Korean fare, from udon to bulgogi, dynamite rolls to sashimi bentos, there is sure to be something on here to satisfy your palate.  Service is good and the kimonos the waitresses wear aren't quite as cringe-worthy as I have seen in other places. Another nice differentiating tip? The fact that they expertly tie your paper chopstick wrappers into a knot for you to rest your chopsticks on.   Atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Sushi is tasty and very filling, and thankfully, there is very little rice involved. Sure, you're paying a couple bucks more than our lunch special friends in the Annex, but the overall experience, and food, is better. Dessert is also included (oranges!) and our tea cups were always filled (though the tea could be hotter).  All in all, a strong debut on Baldwin - let's hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Sweet sushi!! Major style points with the presentation and the chef even came over to make sure we enjoyed. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"What I did like  nice decor (large photographs, paintings, glass tables, clear plastic chairs) friendly service, menu descriptions, combinations, a good variety of selections available (Japanese and Korean), tightly packed rolls, nice presentation  What I didn't like;  Etsu roll was covered with too much sauce, like a moat of it spicy and sweet sauce,  rice could use a bit more vinegar tasteless salmon  So so 2.5"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki and tempura bento box.  I liked the brown rice and korean glass noodles on the side.  The tempura was really good - crispy with a light batter; could use more sauce though.  The chicken teriyaki was okay but I liked that they added some vegetables underneath the chicken.  Price was reasonable. Service was good.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was slack. We were not greeted to our table, water was not given, didn't even know who our server was for 20 mins until we finally asked.  The food was pretty good. Scallop appetizer had no maple flavour, just teriyaki. Which was disappointing. Plus it was way overpriced for what came out. Had the deluxe bento for main and it was fantastic.  Nice decor inside, good food but could be much more welcoming and better service."}
{"text":"Good place for some Japanese food in Baldwin Village.  The tempura is well done - crispy without having a mouthful of oil; and their sashimi is fresh - they have this nice sauce/ vinaigrette over it that I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Solid sushi. It's a good lunch place on a work day because they get you in and out within a hour. The spicy roll set was great and we sat on the patio which was nicely sheltered from the street. It's a tad cramped though.  I like my sushi a bit warm and soft because its super fresh (as in the rice warms up the fish). The rolls have tasty crunchy bits in them. It's more like fusion, so you might not like it if you're a purist. Portions are generous and affordable too."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  As in other reviews, sushi was extremely fresh.  Rolls were also inventive.  Added bonus for attentiveness.  My wife and I went for an anniversary lunch, Etsu noticed that we were ordering items other than those on the primary lunch menu (OK, we had cocktails too), and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  They gave us a complimentary dessert to mark the occasion.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We ordered: I ordered the chirashi (pictured above) and my friends ordered a roll, and two katsu dinners.   Food: The fish was delicious! I love how they used all sorts of different kinds of fish and used different flavourings. The cherry tomatoes and seaweed were a nice touch. Had no idea what to do with the lime. Sushi rice was decent, but I have had better. Not quite enough rice vinegar. My friends seemed happy with their meals although I didn't sample.   Service: Service was quick, attentive, and refilled our water reasonably quick. Food came out all at once, more or less.   Conclusion: 21 dollar Chirashi is pretty good but it's a little expensive and will leave you wanting more. If you're a fan of tamago, there is nothing for you here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best nigiri ever!  I have been on a quest to find an average priced good sushi place and this is where my quest ends! After being disappointed so often I came upon the reviews for Etsu and decided to give it a try. We went on a friday night and it wasn't crowed at all, might be because of the spring break (as told by the waitress).   We ordered: 1. Sweet Sake: Loved it... although the fact that it was made in USA was a bit odd. 2. Chef's Selection Sushi: 4 pieces of nigiri, absolutely delicious!  3. Albacore Tuna: It was part of the above but we liked it so much that we re-ordered it! Love the garlic oil topping 4. Tomago: Good, Mr. H liked it a lot more than I did. 5. Kimchi Roll: My least favourite, it was too strong for my liking. 6. Spicy Scallop Roll: No bad but not great either 7. Snow: Basically a dynamite roll + seared butter fish, yumm!! Loved this! 8. Volcano Roll: I had seem pictures of it online and mine was not similar to that at all, it was average.  I'm surprised it took so long to find this place, I keep getting mailers from all the other places like Sushi Shop, Sushi Tower, Kyoto, etc but this place is waaaaay better than any of them.   Overall, the service was top notch and the nigiri was the best I've had at this price point. Will definitely go back for more! :)"}
{"text":"Yelp has redeemed itself!  After a BAD experience in Niagara Falls using the Yelp app. I was a little hesitant to click on it for advice again. (See review for Young Garden for details)  We were looking for someplace NEW for a change because the previous week me and my gf seriously overkilled K-food at Ka Chi (still one of my favs though) and I had pork bone soup coming out of my ears! We needed a new direction.  Low and behold after typing \"Japanese\" into the app, Etsu popped up with 4 stars. It was actually the pics that fellow Yelpers posted that drew me to this place. The volcano roll, sushi pizza (yum) and rik roll were just jumping out and calling me to give them a try! *insert Zombie grunt here*  Walking down Baldwin st. we were almost side tracked to a different restaurant due to the huge Buzz around it called, KintoRamen. (Will definately try this sometime soon) but the line up & wait  was ridiculous! So we decided to stick with our guns and head to Etsu.  Etsu was empty and as we entered the establishment my gf clinched my hand and gave me the look of  \"are you sure you want to eat here? Why is it so damn deserted stare?\" (Yes, I can read faces)  But with the imagery of Precilla C's (namedrop) and other yelpers pics I took a leap of faith and kept on pursuing to a vacant table.  This place is surprisingly very \"CHILL\" with ambient music in the background. It felt almost \"SPA-like\" and surreal. The huge canvas behind the sushi chef of a Japanese garden I wanted to steal it from them and put in on my own kitchen wall! it was sweet!  We ordered the Rik Rock roll, Sushi Pizza, and Narita combo that came with a wakame salad and home made ice cream. All of the dishes we ordered were exquiste and very well presented. The home made ice cream was the friggin bomb man.  Combining the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful food it honestly felt like I was the Karate Kid on top of Japanese Hot Spring mountian just  finished catching a fly with my chopsticks and enjoying Mr. Miyagi's mothers home cooking! It was a perfect meal at that moment and my stomach was grateful. (& Nah, I didnt smoke anything beforehand)   I will be back here again to try some of the other rolls we didnt get to order and maybe get a taste of the K-food they offer here as well. Will keep you guys updated when that happens.  4.51 stars from me!"}
{"text":"In my top 5 sushi in Toronto at the moment. Just ignore all the other sushi joints on Baldwin & and go here. You won't regret it. Great sashimi."}
{"text":"I went to Etsu for a quick lunch with a friend. We both got one of the lunch specials, which perhaps isn't as much food as some quick bento places in the hood, but by the end, I was stuffed. I did have room for the slice of watermelon, though.  The spicy lunch set was my hands down choice. I couldn't believe how good this was. It is not macerated tuna and salmon mixed with a lot of filler, no this is actual slices of fish with additional spicy sauce and tempura bits rolled in. The number of slices is plenty- 2 rolls, large pieces and soup, salad and watermelon/fruit dessert.  I can't get it out of my mind. This is a few dollars more than the other places around, but the atmosphere and the service and taste are more than worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in love with this charming little place ... it has now become our go-to place for sushi *heart* - thanks yelp :)"}
{"text":"Nice chic modern decor that I wasn't expecting, dim lighting, making it seem almost like a lounge.  I feel the place would be ideal for a date with it`s atmosphere and food.  As others have noted, the presentation of the food is amazing.  No matter what you order, everything looks so pretty!  In particular, we order something similar to the volcanic rolls.  It was rolled up in Tempura flakes that gave great texture and crunch to the roll, you have to try it!    The service was also excellent!  They were very friendly and attentive.  I dropped a chop stick and they immediately noticed and brought a new pair to me by the time I picked it up off the ground.  It have had to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty the particular night we were there, but still, that's service!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but my experience there today made me reevaluate my opinion. We ordered a yaki udon with chicken, there was literally one strip of chicken cut into a million tiny cubes. We also got a chirashi, the sushi rice in there was so dry, it felt like I was chewing on plastic. For rolls, we ordered a rock shrimp, volcano, spicy scallop and tuna. The first three rolls are spicy, but to my disgust, spicy meant the rolls are drenched in spicy mayo. What's more outrageous is, they put the wrong toppings on the rolls, rock shrimp's base roll with volcano's topping and vice versa. The fish was also not fresh and chewy, the sushi rice was once again inedibly dry. This happened on top of waiting 40 min for our food when we were the only customers. The staff, chef including, were chatting for 20 minutes until one of them stepped behind the sushi bar to prepare our food. I can say with certainly that I will not return."}
{"text":"Finally! A decent pair of chopsticks, unlike those jagged edged axe hacked oversized toothpicks you find in 99% of all \"Japanese\" places.  Anyways, everything the other reviewers wrote is true. A very elegantly decorated place, friendly and attentive staff, unobtrusive ambient music, skilfully made and presented food (I've tried among other things Unagi and Fire Mountain maki rolls and Salmon sashimi, which were I would say on a 4 out of 5 stars level), etc.  What I wanted to draw your attention to though is the Mackerel sashimi. I don't remember where I read it before, but somebody said that it was one of the best mackerel he/she ever tried. So I decided to check it for myself. And oh boy did it blew me away! It's unlike any mackerel I've ever tried before. The easiest way to describe it is what a friend of mine did, by comparing it to pickled herring. Only it was like 50 times better! In fact we were so impressed that I decided to ask the owner what the secret was and (surprisingly) he went so far as to tell us all the details. I don't know if I should reveal all of their secrets, but basically they soak the mackerel in a certain Chilean semi-dry wine (btw it's a 30$ bottle in an LCBO store), let it sit there for a couple of days and then slice and serve it. Definitely a star of the show and a must have if you ask me.  Pricewise it's not the cheapest place out there, but honestly for what you get at this place, it's worth every penny. And that is even before counting in the extras: a salad and a miso soup as appetizers and a ginger or a green tea ice-cream and the traditional diced orange for dessert. Definitely a go-back-to place."}
{"text":"This place is good for lunch, but pricey for dinner. The sushi lunch special was really good and beautifully plated! But the salmon teriyaki bento didn't have much food in it (a lot of it was filler). 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Etsu is a nice Japanese restaurant on Baldwin St, downtown.  They have a nice outdoor patio and the interior is nicely decorated.  The waitresses are in kimonos and are friendly even thou their English wasn't that good.  We got the Etsu roll and a love boat - fish was good quality, flavorful, fresh and the roll is nicely made that it doesn't fall apart easily.  Parking as in downtown will be tough, mostly street parking on Baldwin st which is also limited.  My gf used to live on this street so she insist I try most of the places here; which I am trying to do.  Overall, it is a nice little Japanese Restaurant that have some unique rolls in their menu and great service.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 4/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but I was disappointed. Because all the tuna sashimi that I had were not completely defrosted, felt like swallowing up several pieces of fishy ice cream which wasn't fun :(   Other than that, it was an average experience."}
{"text":"Everyone who goes to Etsu must try their \"Etsu Roll\" - tempura, avocado, crab meat, cucumber roll wrapped with salmon & doused with spicy mayo and teriyaki sauce. Heavenly.   Their \"Riks roll\" and \"volcano roll\" are also worth trying."}
{"text":"They have a lovely little patio in the summer, and I really liked that I didn't feel ignored even though we were outside and away from the main serving area. Had the sashimi platter lunch special for $11. (If you want for an extra $2 you can make it a bento box with a few pieces of tempura.) The dish that came out was very visually pleasing (I posted a photo), and although not a huge portion, it seemed very fresh, with a combination of seared and raw fish, and roe. A nice lunch spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The staff here was really nice to let my bf and I come in just before their lunch shift was about to end. I ordered the cod bento and really enjoyed it! There was also rice, salad, tempura and sushi that came with the bento so it was a really complete meal. The cod itself was also really good, flavourful and moist! However I do admit that a $12-13 bento is a bit pricey for lunch I believe the quality does somewhat make up for the high price, though not entirely. However definitely bonus pts for letting us come in so last minute since I knew that we would also disrupt their eating time in the process.  Also, don't come in here expecting authentic Japanese, it's Korean run. Still fantastic nonetheless though!"}
{"text":"Etsu's food isn't authentic Japanese but hey man, I'm not going to fault them.  The waitress who was dressed in a kimono was very attentive and quick (and believe me, moving around in one of those things ain't easy). My friend and I ordered 3 different veggie rolls (asparagus, tempura yam and vegetable futomaki). They're all reasonably priced ($4.99 on average). I had the agedashi tofu which was delightfully crispy and tasty in a thick teriyaki-like sauce. The veggie rolls could've used more flavour on the rice. I liked the cute little Japanese-designed wallet that the bill came in at the end. nice touch, etsu, nice touch!"}
{"text":"Located in the restaurant hub of Baldwin Village this place has already its work cut out for it. The decor stands out from other places in the area and has a modern take.  The menu was a bit surprising as it almost equally represented Korean and Japanese fare.  Anyway we were starving from our earlier futile attempt to secure a spot in our first choice for Japanese food. We settled for the following Sushi Combo 1, Narita, and Nagoya set menu. Narita and Nagoya came with wakame salad which had nice presentation. Miso soup was OK better than the watered down version one gets usually. The main looked OK nothing special just what one gets at your corner Sushi place. The tempura was actually cold! one surprising item was avocado tempura (I haven't had it before though was surprised by the result in a good way) Sashimi was OK and sushi was actually below average with the rice being very dry. My fellow diner commented its just your run of a mill stuff for the chicken teriyaki.    The advertised hand made ice cream though good was minuscule portion (more of a palate cleanser) . Beer selection is below average as well.  2.5 stars max."}
{"text":"This great new sushi restaurant beats all the surrounding Baldwin neighbours, hands down. Etsu is sleek and modern, with fresh flowers and intriguing artwork. The kimono-clad servers are very friendly and efficient, and best of all, the sushi is delicious. I had the spicy tuna/salmon lunch special, which came with 14 pieces for $9, including Miso and salad. Hell of a deal."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a sushi master, but I eat A LOT of sushi. I even ventured to make sushi. Although I don't see sushi chef in my future. This place. IS AMAZING. The price is reasonable. The service is amazing! They give you a  free ice cream scoop!  The food is always fresh.  Definitely one of the best sushi place (if not so, atleast for the price range) in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a creative twist, fun modern decor and great service made Etsu a standout! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Etsu is the cute smart nice girl that you went to high school with that you can't find anything bad to say about. The food is delicious, I particularly like the unagi roll. Soup, salad and homemade ice cream are all complimentary. The servers are the sweetest, nicest of any restaurant (you can't receive more lovely service than from a woman named Cookie). My friend almost cried when our meal-finishing green tea ice cream was accompanied by a heart shaped spoon. Perfect place for a Valentine's day meal."}
{"text":"I'm impressed!  Dropping in to Etsu for a random weekday lunch, and not having had too much experience with the restaurants on Baldwin, I didn't know what to expect.  We both ordered the dynamite role lunch set that came also came with avocado rolls ($9.99).  The set also came with soup and salad.  Soooo good!  The avocado rolls were more than twice the size of rolls from most other restaurants and the tempura shrimp in the dynamite role was just so succulent.  Service was fast, the decor was nice, the food and company was great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is fantastic and the ambience is lovely.   Tea and a scoop of ice cream (their choice, I've had ginger, green tea, caramel fudge) is on the house. It's a little pricier than the average sushi shop, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it.   The owners are Chinese, and by that I was a little bit disappointed, but they do try very hard to give you a Japanese feel with their manners and saying hello/goodbye in Japanese.   Watch out for their rolls with spicy sauce because they might go a little overboard and decorate the whole plate with the sauce, and for anyone who's sensitive to spicy (as I am), that kills the appetite.  And it's great this place offers Korean food as well (although once again I must remark that it is more expensive than other Korean food places), which is great is you're looking to have non-greasy asian food.   It's a perfect place for a first date, as you'll have a lot to talk about, the art on the wall, the music, the tables, or the cute chopstick holders, as well as the dessert.   If you're there for delivery, you'll walk out feel extra good from the smiley face on your take-out bag."}
{"text":"Good chopsticks, great food, great price.   I had lunch at Etsu today and it was everything I expected and really not a far stretch from previous reviews.   I, too, had the spice roll set lunch special ($8.95 for 14 pieces) and also threw in a 2 pc mackerel on Lev F's advice. Definitely tasty all the way around and a definite must-do again."}
{"text":"What a great sushi place!  The interior is so trendy and awesome AND I heard through the grapevine the owner did all the photography.  The lunch specials are massive and delicious!  I usually get vegetarian sushi and the vegetarian sushi is the bomb.  You get crisp, fresh veggie tempura.  2 types of yummy maki AND miso soup with a little, green salad.  And then at the end of your meal, you get cute little treats like mini smoothies or a craved orange.  The service was great and I was so pleased with the entire experience, to the point where I returned less than a week later.  I am so happy to have finally discovered GOOD sushi close to the U of T campus!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here.  The interior is nice, the service is quick and the quality of the food is great.  We had the pork belly appetizer, which was so deliciously soft and yielding and flavourful in soy sauce reduction.  I could have eaten that all night.  I guess they had me at pork:)  afterwards I had the bento box with tasty shrimp tempura (no skinny shrimps here), delicately battered, teriyaki beef, cooked medium and deliciously glazed, and sushi, which were very fresh and authentic tasting.  I will come back here for a nice dinner if O am jonesing for high-end sushi.  Nice place for a date with unobtrusive but helpful service and great ambiance with lots of light coming through."}
{"text":"This place in incredible! One of the best and most affordable sushi places in Toronto. My brother is a vegan and when he said that, instead of getting flustered, the server double checked every item he ordered and even asked the chef to modify some dishes. In the end, the chef himself came out to find out if the food was acceptable. We left with such an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. Also their speciality roll is so so delicious, the sauce on it - don't know what it is, it's great.  Amazing staff, amazing food. So glad to have found it."}
{"text":"This place used to be good quality. Tonight however was a disaster! The sushi chef did everything from talking on the phone to cleaning the bathroom, except for preparing our order. Not only did it take a century for the sushi to arrive, but it was simply awful. The fish was chewy, rice crusty and seaweed not fresh. Moreover, they mixed up the two rolls and one ended up having the filling of the other! It was simply terrible! I don't suspect this happens all the time, but the $100 dinner was not pleasant at all."}
{"text":"Came after going to the AGO on a Fri night.  We were the only patrons at 9pm.  Nice decor not typical with glass tabletops and dark wood floors.  Ordered chirashi and the etsu sushi combo.    The fish was fresh and flavorful.  The mountain roll was good too (asparagus).  The salad was fresh and the miso soup was standard fare.  Dessert was a free homemade ice cream.  Couldn't place the flavour of it.  We're told it's Thai basil - interesting.  Would come again next time I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"I still frequent Etsu, and having tried out their various non-sushi/japanse offerings I still have high praise for it. Their bibimbap is amazing although I prefer the dolsot one a lot more than the fast cooling \"non-dolsot\" bibimbap. And their cold soba dish with a cold soup you use for dip is tons of fun to eat especially since they supply you with a kitchen knife to cut off the long noodles.  Noodle eating had never been that much and easy since I could just chop off any overhang there was :)   Their service is still very friendly even if you're there for take out, they always offer you hot tea and 5 - 6 \"thank you\" and \"good bye\" when you leave (don't you just hate it when customers continue exiting without acknowledging the staff when they put that much of an effort?)  Just thought I'd put that in there so you're not afraid to try out their non-Japanese options as well!   Also make sure to enjoy complimentary fruit at the end of your meal!!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a review here - I wanted to keep this a hidden gem! I say hidden because despite the amount of ratings on Yelp, this place never seem to be packed with customers.   The price is great for what you get and I'd be happy to eat their sushi every week.  The variety of fish you get is great, sushi rice at perfect temperature, and all the nigiri get their own sauce and topping such as fried garlic pieces, finely chopped green onion, or mince ginger. The attention to detail is astonishing. Every nigiri is made with love.  One star off for the weird service and waitress. But who cares guys - just come for the amazing sushi, you won't regret this."}
{"text":"There are so many places to choose from on the Baldwin strip. Some more pricier than others, and some with more mediocre food than others. Some having long lines ups (Kinton ahem) that seems impossible to get a seat.   I really liked this small place, upstairs above a really good and cheap korean restaurant. This one seemed to have more variety and quality food than the other ones around.    Sitting at glass tables, the decor is modern and artsy, with an asian flare without being too in your face, except the horse face which i found amusing.   The combos are around $16-18 which may seem like a lot, but there is lots of food. We also shared a cheaper Udon noodles for about $12.   Our Teriyaki combo came with lots of tempura, beef teryaki on a bed of cabbage, 9-12 pc sashimi, rice salad and homemade ice cream. I even had some left over for dinner.  The fish was really fresh tasting and generous portion size.   The seafood spicy udon was a change from the usual. Lots of seafood and clams with a fish broth that I couldn't stop drinking.  The service was really friendly.  Everything seemed very detail oriented and delicate which I appreciated.  I don't know about the Korean food on the menu. Makes me wonder because of the Korean place downstairs. It's probably cheaper downstairs, so I would probably skip it.   This place is small, so great for a quiet date or quick dinner like we did!"}
{"text":"First of I was so psyched to have found Baldwin street, I stumbled upon it about 4 years ago and couldn't remember what it was called or any of the vendors on the street to google, I just knew it was this super cute street that I really wanted to go to again.   I went here with my sister in her break in between classes, the decor is super awesome, the art is beautiful and fits in. There are no random pieces here or mismatched colors.  I love those glass looking chairs!  So when I opened the fancy menu I was shocked that the prices were so low, even though we had missed the lunch specials by an hour or so the prices were still reasonable.   We weren't in the mood for sushi (SHOCK!) so we went for the Korean part in the menu.   Delish!!!   ps. It's not 5 star because I wouldn't drive specifically to this place but I'll definitely make a stop if I'm close by."}
{"text":"You cant find many GREAT Japanese restuarants downtown but this one is a hidden gem. Located in the bustling and attractive Baldwin Street area, Etsu Sushi is my go to place if I want a delicious Japanese place for lunch. They have lunch specials ranging from $10-15 and you can choose from a sashimi/sushi set or a bento box. The quality of the sashimi is up there as they are fresh and is cut in perfect sizes. I was blown away by the presentation and the little amount of time it took to serve 6 plates/meals to our table. The service was friendly, quick and efficient! The ambience speaks for itself as it goes hand in hand with the beautiful presentation of their plates."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from my sister.  She has always been the sushi baron in the family. No lie,  if she could she would eat it everyday for every meal. A few months ago she told me about Etsu. Right when she said it was on Baldwin I immediately hesitated.  Cardinal rule...If there's a row of more than 6 restaurants slowly walk away. I know there's always the exception, but usually if you have a crowded, over saturated area that has become touristy the food doesn't deliver. But hey, this was a recommendation from my sister herself so I decided to put the rule away and hope for the exception.  On first impression, Etsu was doing pretty good. They have a great patio, sheltered by bushes and flowers. The restaurant is minimal in regards to decoration but it's clean and modern looking. The service was sweet. My waitress hardly spoke any English but she did her best and was very kind. A little slow, but I wasn't in a rush.   I ordered some sashimi, a green salad and the Etsu special role. The green salad was tiny, the sashimi not very flavorful or fresh and the Etsu role covered in mayo. I mean drenched. I couldn't even see the sushi. It was inedible. They were very kind to take it back and try again.   Overall, I wasn't impressed with the sushi offerings or the quality. Even looking at what my friend ordered I wasn't inclined to order something else off the menu. I bumped this up to a 3 star because the staff were hard working and tried to fix the roll, but the fish didn't sing and when you're eating raw fish that's the one thing I've come to expect. I hate to say it, but sis, you've lost your touch."}
{"text":"So about that Baldwin village. How gastro-centric can one small street get? With all these up and coming noodle bars, quality sushi, and japanese bistros- you literally lose track of how lucky and trendy Toronto gets with food.  Etsu isn't a new comer, but it's been revamped. It carries a chic lounge vibe with blue lighting, glass tables, lit walls and floors now. The menu is changed too, it's more pricey. It felt like an LA hot spot that demanded head-over-heel prices for mediocre sushi.   Going in, I was worried about these things. The prices ended up to be in the middle of the road, not extremely over priced. Bento Boxes were 22 bucks, rolls were 6-15 bucks. Nothing crazy at all.  I ended up getting the deluxe assorted sushi and an additional roll that had butter fish, tuna and salmon wrapped in butter fish, tuna and salmon... How can you not want that?  The presentation of the dishes was on another level, it was gorgeous. The portions aren't dinky in the same regard. But it's the quality of the ingredients, the rice, and the freshness of the fish that kills you. Etsu served me some of the most delicious sushi I've had since Sushi Kaji. Then again, I haven't been to many other sushi places other than those that serve AYCE. Nonetheless, the sushi was great. I recommend nigiri over rolls, hands down.   Oh, and the fish wrapped in fish roll was giant pieces of sashimi rolled in rice with sashimi layered on top.  Overall, I really liked my experience and the food at Etsu. The service is a tad slow, but the food is incredibly fresh. The atmosphere is chic and modern but I disliked the lighting because it made my sushi glow blue which, took away from it's natural appeal."}
{"text":"Although the seaweed salad was really tiny, I have to give these guys 5 stars for the top notch, fresh, delicious sushi and the nice decor doesn't hurt either. Try the smoked butterfish roll- so good!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I've had in Toronto. Thin layer of rice. Burst of flavour. Coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Lunch specials are nicely made too. Seafood don is the best. Korean owned."}
{"text":"We reserved beforehand for a group of 15 people for lunch on a Friday. They had us pre-order before we arrived via e-mail. This worked out really well as the food came 15 minutes after we arrived and some of us even ordered on the spot.  FOOD: I had the Chirashi as recommended by many Yelpers, and it was delicious. It came with a variety of sashimi such as salmon, tuna, caviar and butterfish as well as a balanced blend of rice seasoning, seaweed, ginger, and a cucumber. The rice at the bottom was not soggy, very fragrant and paired well with the sashimi pieces. It came with a side of miso soup (nothing extraordinary) and typical small salad with Japanese dressing.  DRINKS: We didn't order any drinks but they do have a decent selection of sake.  SERVICE: Service was very good. The servers came around with all our food promptly and managed our big group well.  All in all we were very satisfied with the food and service. The lunch menu is also very affordable considering this is a decent Japanese restaurant. I will return again for their bento boxes and maki rolls!"}
{"text":"Etsu off the main Dundas street on the Baldwin strip gives itself even more mystique.  As you peek your head through the Garden entrance into it's own intriguing Wonderland that features Japanese cuisine.    The theme continues within it's doors not to the extent that it falsifies itself as being on Japanese soil. Those little PAPER CRANE chopstick holders were a fine touch if not a conversation starter.  We actually tested them out by ordering Cold Soba($7.95). They past the test and was quite enthused to provide assistance. It's routine Cold Soba within the Toronto realm. Unless you search for authentic made ones, it's as good as anywhere else.  Black Dragon($9.95)    Etsu($10.95)    Fire Mountain($7.95) Makisushi of Western flavour even as such was overly covered sauced. The sauce coats the tongue leaving very little surface area to taste the rest.  I have a weird feeling that I should have ordered the Korean food instead. Why else would there be Korean fare on the Menu? How many Japanese chefs have you seen cooking Korean food? Benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it's pretty nice. Ambience is very good: dimmed lights, soft music and very clean. Food is amazing: nice presentation, fresh ingredients and it melts in your mouth. It's only 3 stars because they could work on their service. The lady server wasn't attentive: she never once ask us how's everything or if we need anything else. We keep having to call her over to refill our drinks and when we need to order more food.  Overall - great place! Would come back again and hopefully, the service will be better."}
{"text":"I came here for a girl's night dinner with my girlfriends. I have to say I've walked by this place many times before but have never tried and haven't really pay much attention to this place either. This place is good for a small group of friends, but if you are a party of 6 make sure you make reservations because this place is small and I think they can only accommodate one table of 6 people. The menu selection is pretty good. The prices, I would say,  is average for a sushi restaurant. The servers were all very friendly.  The only think that I thought was lacking was that we had to ask many times to get refill for our tea. The food was good though. I ordered the sushi regular plate.  I really enjoyed my food.  Over all this place was good and so close to my office, maybe next time I will come here for lunch."}
{"text":"My friend showed me this restaurant few days ago. It's hidden inside the inner streets, next to a bunch of other cultural eats. The outside patio is adorable with pillows and tables, kindof small tho. The inside is small but spacious.   We came in the evening (dinner menu)   Friend ordered vegetable Gyoza, California roll, Black dragon roll and green tea ice cream. Gyoza comes in 5 smaller pieces, we split eating that, only reason we ordered this because they don't have any spring rolls :( California is basic 6 crab piece roll and the black dragon has cooked eel on the top of the regular dynamite( avocado, shrimp tempura).  It has about 10 pieces.    I got the Fire mountain roll, California roll and green tea ice cream. Fire mountain roll contains crab I believe with asparagus, avocado, fish eggs and spicy tobiko sauce. This roll also came with 10 pieces.   The presentation of all the rolls was so pleasing, average price range but I think it's very well worth your money.   Over all, good experience, tasty sushi. Total bill was $ 40, along with complimentary homemade chocolate pecan ice cream."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to check it out after school for lunch. I got the chicken katsu with curry sauce and my friend got a bento box. The food came relatively quickly. They messed up my sauce and gave me katsu instead but they fixed it quickly and even gave us a complimentary plate of spicy salmon roll!   Servers were nice and helpful. The decor is super chic and loved the jazzy music! I like the food too. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Should have ordered the chirashi instead. The salmon portion in the salmon bento is so small. Other than that, everything is perfect."}
{"text":"Seriously good sushi. We started with the udon noodles, which had some of the softest noodles I think I've ever tasted. We got them to add chicken into the broth, which was off menu, and it was totally perfect. For sushi rolls, we got the Snow, Kamikaze, and Spicy Tuna, and it was the most amazing combination ever. Seriously good restaurant. Totally fair prices, and definitely get the udon plus sushi combo. Udon heaven, plus sushi heaven, equals a really good heaven."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Their sushi is quite good and their cooked Japanese food is even better. Usually, the teriyaki and gyoza pales in the bento boxes. Not here. Sooooo great."}
{"text":"This place recently got a new owner and new interior facelift. But it's still a great restaurant to eat at! My friends and I usually go for dinner there. It's our go-to place whenever we need to grab dinner somewhere. The atmosphere is quiet and casual and intimate. Perfect place for a few friends eating together or a nice date. The food is also really good and the waiters are very nice.   Would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. I went with a group of friends and we got two platters of sushi for 8 people in addition to appetizers. The service is fast and clean. We had a great time there."}
{"text":"After wandering around the AGO, my friend and I were looking for something close by. Picked Etsu because of the Yelp reviews and we were definitely impressed.   The ambiance and decor were consistent and soothing. We ordered a few maki rolls and were pleased when our server brought us complimentary salads and miso soup. The banana tempura roll was delicious and could be eaten as dessert!   We had another treat come along with our bill- homemade Thai basil ice cream. Very tasty! Will be returning and looking forward to enjoying the outdoor seating in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while my boyfriend and I were looking for a light evening dinner. So glad we came here; we were not expecting the beautiful and delicate preparation of the sushi, and it was sooo good! The steamed shrimp dumplings were incredible!"}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant after the Blue Jays game.  It was a 25 minute walk from the stadium and located in Chinatown.  My albacore tuna nigiri was cooked on top which was a little weird but my Philadelphia roll was outstanding.    The interior was well designed and the prices were really good.  If I'm ever in the area, I will be back.  You can also enjoy your food outside as well."}
{"text":"I've made it my goal to try every sushi restaurant in downtown Toronto. Today, it was Etsu on Baldwin St. Ooh boy, this is my favourite place yet! They have covered every single aspect you could want in a restaurant. The decor is beautiful, the menus are beautiful, heck even the waitresses are beautiful. My waitress wore a stunning kimono.  The weather was great, so I sat outside on the patio, in the warm sunshine, surrounded by flowers. The presentation of the food was gorgeous too. I got a Bento box with miso soup, salad, 6 California rolls (cucumber and avocado), 6 yam tempura rolls and 5 pieces of tempura (1 shrimp, 4 assorted vegetables). Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious. I had trouble finishing my meal, but I hate wasting sushi, so I managed to finish it. All of this amazing food for only $8.99! I will definitely be going back here again, possibly weekly! ;-p"}
{"text":"Tasty Japanese food with large portion, but the service is a bit slow. Will definitely come back in the future, the price is very reasonable. Quality is better than average Japanese restaurant in the city"}
{"text":"Super slow service. Minimum customer service. Waited 30 min for order while there were only 4 customers in the whole restaurant. But they did give us free food to make up for it so it's ok."}
{"text":"Sushi I had there was stale and smelly, not fresh at all. Did not taste good either. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I feel like I've been spoiled with good sushi/Japanese in the past year so comnig to Etsu was a slight disappointment.  The patio was small, and can fit about three 2-seaters per table.  This wasn't bad considering it was just my friend and I.  The decor was nice - lots of beautiful flowers everywhere, and the table was nicely set up with this cute/adorable ceramic crane that sat in front of you so you can you place your chopsticks.  Didn't get to go inside to see how it actually looks like.  Then we order.  Lunch specials - not bad.  $8.90 per box/dish.  Our waitress brings us water.  It was already weird when getting the water -- nice glasses; but disgusting tasting.  My friend and I looked at each other and we were so confused about what the heck the taste was in the water.  I guess a little chalky tasting.  We decide to both order the spicy roll set because everybody was raving about it.  The salad comes, and it wasn't good at all.  Don't know what it was - but I was not impressed by it.  The miso soup was okay - however, a little too hot for my liking.  Not only this - the waitress spilled a it of it on my friend.  We get our sushi -- spicy salmon and spicy tuna.  Not bad - was quite filling -- especially for lunch.  For the price that we're paying, the quality of the sushi was worth it.  Okay food, but I felt like I've had MUCH better food and service."}
{"text":"Waited 1:30 hour for a table of 3. There were 4 waitresses that just stood around while 2 cooks worked the sushi bar. No sense of urgency. Only gave a small plate of edamame for it all. The sushi was okay, but the wait was absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"A delightful restaurant. Modern interior. Pleasant jazz music and friendly atmosphere. Good food inventively presented. Good portion sizes and well priced. Recommended"}
{"text":"Fairly modern, and next to Kinton and another sushi resto or two, this might be an easy place to overlook - but you would be remiss.  I came here solely based on the number of good reviews from my fellow Yelpers (and this many Yelpers just cant be wrong!)  I ordered the chicken katsu bento and a side of uni sashimi. While the bento was average (hence only 4 stars), the uni was hands down the best uni Ive ever had in the city. I immediately regretted ordering the bento instead of more sushi/sashimi - clearly this place knows what theyre doing. I am beyond impressed, and will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Etsu is simply put, quite good Japanese food. for a reasonable price you get reasonably good food. I came here for dinner with 3 friends and I ordered the bento and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the small-ish looking portions add up and I left the restaurant feeling like a foie gras duck.   I had the dinner bento with teriyaki chicken and everything was done right. Their miso soup could use a bit more seaweed/tofu but it's just an appetizer. The same old salad with that sour ginger sauce was given and that was also quite good.   Then the bento came with it's 9 pieces of sashimi, butter fish, salmon and toro. Some tempura'd vegetables and shrimp, the teriyaki, rice and a whole load of other stuff that I can't remember. The tempura was done right, it wasn't the dense battered tempura that some bad Japanese places will do but battered in panko, biting into it is like biting into happiness, light and crunchy.   The sashimi was good all fresh, salmon soft and smooth, toro had a nice light taste and the butter fish melted in your mouth.  The teriyaki was also very atypical but also really delicious, nicely seared chicken that retained its moisture with a light drizzle of teriyaki that was tangy and savoury a real rice thief. No literally this teriyaki chicken got off the plate and stole my f***in' rice.  4/5 stars for quality food and beautiful decor, loses a star for being memorable and original*.  *It's not either of those things"}
{"text":"Four of us were seated in this 50% full restaurant on Labour Day, and ordered 3 of their unagi bento specials. Unfortunately, we were then treated to a cup of water and a mug of tea for over an hour before the head chef apologized and mentioned that there were many customers ahead of us (the restaurant had about 25% capacity at this point in time, many patrons having been served). He had a complimentary sushi appetizer sent to appease our hunger temporarily, and then went back to serving literally everyone but us. Two tables were seated, were served, and left before the 1.5 hour mark, and I asked the waitress politely if we were going to be served tonight. The chef said 5 minutes, she said 10 minutes, and so we waited 15 before leaving on empty stomachs and disappointment. It's unfortunate, since I've been here twice before, and have not been let down. I hope that my next visit won't be as unwelcome."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed whenever I've gone to Etsu. This place has been here for a while and the quality has always been consistent over the years. It's a nice & clean. The ambience is nice too (we were noticing interesting 70s type music over lunch today). Food-wise, it's good clean tastes (which is what I really appreciate with sushi/sashimi). I usually get the bento-boxes here the most though (when I come for lunch). My favorite is the salmon teriyaki bento box--the fish is soft and tender and flavored really well, with lots of veggies. The restaurant can get crowded during lunch time, but I've never really had to wait long to get seated. Service is nice and fast as well. This has got to be one of my favorite places to eat lunch in Baldwin!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I think U of T students should feel spoiled that they have so many great sushi restaurants nearby...or great restaurants in general. Ryerson as well. Etsu is simply one of tens of sushi restaurants that's within walking distance of the two campuses.  Coming in for lunch, the place was pretty much full seated. However the servers did get to me in a reasonable speed, so all was good. I ordered the sushi lunch plate, as I wanted more sushi compared to other bento ingredients.  The sushi was really well crafted and tasty, and even included scallop! Many of the fish were seared (which I love but some people might dislike), but the essentials were there. As long as it's fresh, tasty, and presented in somewhat of an acceptable manner, it works for me. This meal fitted the whole bill IMO.  Service was very good despite the busy-ness of the restaurant. The employees covered all corners of the restaurant well, and turnaround is quite fast. So even if you have to wait...it won't be long!"}
{"text":"This is now my goto sushi place in Toronto. They have a great roll menu. Ever since I moved back to Toronto from California, I have been missing really good rolls. Those ones with the crazy sauces on them! This place has them. Highlights are rik's roll, the spicy tuna roll, and all the dragon rolls (red, green, and black).  The other main attraction there is on the a la carte menu: the saba. This is fresh mackerel they bath in a Chilean white wine for several days. It's a dream! Imagine herring in white wine to the power of infiinity! the texture is perfect. Sweet. succulent. delicious! my only complaint is that they have been out of it my last 2 visits!  You also get tonnes of freebies here. miso soup, salad, and a fruit desert. Sometimes they even bring you complimentary ice cream too. The service is just excellent."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is warm and comfortable. Its somewhere you want to be when its snowing outside. Like other Yelpers say, the restaurant has style. It is modern and trendy. The restaurant is surprisingly not loud even with all the tables being full. The setting is also romantic, which would be a good idea to bring a date here.   My party ordered: chirashi, sashimi regular, curry udon, yellow tail roll and black dragon roll.  Like other Yelpers say, the chirashi is hands down the best one I tried in Toronto for this price tag. The sushi is reasonably priced for eating a la carte in downtown. The sashimi in our dishes were really fresh and the rolls tasted really good. Overall, the food was delicious.   The waitress here is nice but the service can be slightly slow because they usually only have one to two waitresses on the job.   Highly recommend Etsu if you wanna eat some fresh sushi and sashimi in downtown Toronto and you want to stay in the $$ price range."}
{"text":"Oooh yay! I'm a big fan!  Everything about this place screams cute! The cozy dining room, the outside area, the art on the walls, the ceramic paper crane chopstick holders, the waitress in a kimono, the glass furniture... There are so many perfect little details in this restaurant...like everything mentioned above, and the subtly curved chopsticks (to help you nab that elusive piece of slippery fish), or the water (I asked the waitress--they have oranges, lemons, limes, kiwis, strawberries, and more sitting in the water jug...so the water smells of fruit, but tastes like water), the beautifully bound menus...  So what if this place is a bit pricier (I actually thought it really wasn't pricey at all--the portions are large)? So what if it's not authentic?  It's the perfect restaurant experience, really down to the last detail."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch when hanging out in Baldwin.  I had the Sushi box and my partner had the Sushi/tempora box.  The sushi was decent quality, and the yam roll was delicious. Not a huge amount of food for the price, but higher quality than most of the places around here.  The bigges dissapointment was that my sushi lunch special had 3 salmon out of the pieces, clearly trying to just make up number. I wouldn't go out of my way to end up here, but if I was in the area it isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with two other people. We were seated immediately upon entering and given complimentary green tea.   Service: 5/5 I can't eat gluten and my partner can't eat shellfish. We explained this to the server and she was very accommodating. I brought my own tamari and asked if I could use it, but she said the restaurant had some and brought it for me. My partner was able to substitute one roll in his maki special for another without shellfish without any issues. Our salads and soups arrived promptly (mine without dressing - the server informed me that there was gluten in the dressing). After we finished our soup/salad, our lunch orders arrived quickly.   Food: 4/5 The salad was much nicer and fresher than most other sushi restaurant salads. It featured mixed greens and a few thinly sliced vegetables.   My sashimi platter was amazing. The fish was fresh and came garnished with strawberries, tomatoes, seaweed and rice noodles. I got two pieces of five different types of fish. Everything tasted amazing save for the tilapia, which I personally don't enjoy in sashimi. Both of the other dishes (maki) were well-presented and very tasty. The maki doesn't have too much rice, which both of my dining companions enjoyed.   The ginger and wasabi is served in separate containers for the table, which was a nice touch. We were all able to take as much as we wanted without wasting anything. I really enjoyed the ginger, which seemed homemade (I didn't conform this though)  It took a little while to pay once we were done, but the restaurant filled up while we were finishing, so I assume the servers were busy with other customers."}
{"text":"Waitresses are dressed up in traditional (?) Japanese clothing, it was quite neat.  I've been consistently impressed by the quality of the food, it's definitely a step up from your run-of-the-mill sushi restaurant (e.g. New Generation, Sushi on Bloor). They also give some interesting bonus treats (?) from time to time. I got caramel ice cream after lunch once, and I recall getting some neat tea with blueberry or flowers in it or something after dinner once? Pretty cool.  Place is very clean, service was very quick and attentive.  A little too much wasabi in the sushi for my taste but otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"I'd really give this place 4.5 stars, because I've been to better places in other cities.  But this is probably one of the best overall places I've been in Toronto and I keep coming back so I'll bend on the nice side.  I've had lots of different things here: tempura, unajyu, sushi negiri, sushi rolls, hand rolls, teriyaki, fried crab, etc.  All good.  Meals come with miso soup that's pretty good and also both ice cream and watermelon for dessert.  Actually I wouldn't recommend the unajyu (aka unagi don aka eel on a bed of rice) because the eel wasn't fresh...that's probably just too hard to come by in Toronto.  However, if you've never been to California or Japan then this is probably the best unajyu you would've ever had.    Part of what makes Etsu good is not just the good food but the good value.  I've had meals here for $20 that are far better than what I've paid $40 at other places in Toronto.  I find the service is very good, though I've only been serviced by either this one Japanese girl (great for impressing people with my Japanese chops) or the owner/manager...who is not Japanese. One time I was there quite late and he was really nice and served my friends and I three different flavors of ice cream and really showed that service doesn't have to be bad or rude...a lesson that other places in Toronto should learn.    There are even little nuances like the chopsticks and oki (chopstick rests) and the tables and decor in general that make this place a cut above competitors on Queen St or, well, anywhere I've been around town.  So I'll keep coming back since I have never been disappointed with this place and I am regularly disappointed with most places I go in Toronto."}
{"text":"I didn't even know that Etsu existed when I joined a dinner-in-progress there late one Friday night. I quickly ordered (my default chirashi) before soaking in the decor. Although most of the lighting and furnishings screamed Ikea, minute details piqued interest. From everyone's unique chopstick holders to the various large paintings, much debate was sparked. At the end of a delicious and filling meal, we were even offered complimentary \"homemade\" ice cream in a variety of flavours."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi restaurant in Baldwin Village!   Having eaten at all of them (all 5?) at one time or another, Etsu is really the star. I talked to one of the watiers when it first opened, and he mentioned they \"knew they had a lot of competition and were trying to do something different\", and they certainly have.   The food is really great, and the servings are the perfect size. The roll sets (my favorite: spicy roll set!) come with upwards of 20 pieces, and is priced at $8ish for lunch, and $14ish for dinner. If you decide to spring for dinner, they will bring you lovely rose-water tea once you've finished your meal.   The service here is really great too - the staff are very attentive, but not over the top. I love their attire as well, and that they meet you at the door not only when you arrive, but when you leave!   The decor of the restaurant gives it a very modern, upscale feeling (but for a low price!). There are glass tables, hardwood floors, and cool clear chairs. Also, I've heard that the photography on the walls is all done by the owner, and it is really beautiful (and a nice personal touch). I feel this is a great date spot, especially for a student on a budget!   Since the restaurant just added outdoor seating for the summer months, I'm excited to go back and enjoy a spicy roll set on their patio!  My only complaint about this place is that their salads (specifically: dressing) are not the best I've had - but really that's quite typical for a sushi spot."}
{"text":"My other half frequents this sushi establishment every now and then with her co-workers. She was always hyping up the lunch specials, specifically the Chirashi bowl. We tried it one Saturday, and I was really blown away!   Place is small, and felt overly modern, but don't let that scare you off.  Fish was very fresh, with a number of different cuts. I loved the octopus with ponzu, and addition of Ikura(Salmon Roe). Great lunch price too.   I haven't tried anything else yet, but if it's any indication of their other items, they'll be seeing me soon"}
{"text":"Etsu is chic, contemporary, and its food tastes as good as it looks.   Having grown up in Asia, I have extremely high standards for sushi. This is the first sushi restaurant I found in Toronto that was phenomenally delicious, but at the same time didn't burn your wallet.   Size: sushi and portions are larger than most restaurants, most dishes are complemented with a salad with wafu dressing and miso soup.   Price: extremely reasonable for the quality and size of the food, around $15 for a good meal  D√©cor: trendy, spacious and clean. I especially love their glass tables and translucent chairs.   Ambience: has a jazzy feel to it, thumbs up for the music selection. Perfect scene for a casual date.   Favorite dishes: sushi platter, Kalbi, Bulgolgi, Udon   Service: Service and speed are reasonable. The restaurant gets a bit busy sometimes, and there is only one server. The one time I had to wait too long, the server was considerate enough to eliminate the tip option when I was paying for the bill."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some maki rolls! We ordered the spicy salmon, volcano, and the spider (soft shell crab) rolls.  The spicy salmon was bursting at the seams with fresh fish, and was actually spicy! I liked their interpretation of the volcano roll, the partially cooked salmon on top was a nice touch. The spider roll was also delicious, especially the end pieces which consisted of what i can only assume was a giant among crabs hanging out of the end.  With the huge paintings on the wall, clear plastic chairs, and glass tables you feel like you're in one of the nicest restaurants on Baldwin street. Service was fast and attentive, will definitely be back.  Only thing i didn't like was that their wasabi wasn't fresh and didn't have any kick to it."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant with a modern interior and a nice mix of Music playing in the background. The service was good but the food was very forgettable."}
{"text":"4.5* Etsu is one of downtown TO's best kept secrets, and a spot I would not have discovered if not for the rave reviews of Yelpista Dishan W! In a city bursting with mediocre sushi joins, having a place that is as consistent as Etsu and not overcrowded is really a blessing. Maybe the stairs you have to take to this above ground level restaurant dissuade lazy or starving patrons, but I can tell you that this place is the only reason I still find myself wandering towards Baldwin.  To start, the fish has been fresh on every visit. By this point I've tried most rolls and sashimi and I would say for some reason the RickRoll stuck in my mind! The green dragon and volcano were also amongst the favourites.  Another factor that keeps me coming back is the fact that appetizers at Etsu are easily a cut above the other sushi joints in the same price range. The tempura is always light and flaky without being greasy, and the Korean items (especially the veggie Pa Jun), make me happy that this is a fusion restaurant. Something I can not as easily say for pretty much all of the other Korean/Japanese restaurants in Toronto.   Overall, if you like Sushi, this is probably on top of what you can find in the intermediate price range in Toronto. If you don't like sushi, go get a Pa Jun!"}
{"text":"The place has a new owner. Much improved since the previous direction of the last owner. Cooked food stays true to Japanese style dishes but has alot of French cooking influences.   Get the Etsu dinner for two. For $49.99 the chef chooses a wide selection of sashimi and nigiri. It is not the typical sushi fish either; you'll get toro, sea bream, halibut, hotate etc... You also get a dynamite roll which is fine as well. Good service. Nice lady servers, quite attentive and quick. High quality fresh fish. Cool young sushi chef.   If you are cheap and want to impress on a budget, then order the sashimi and sushi lunch for two; it is only $29.99. You get similar items as the Etsu dinner for two and you look relatively generous."}
{"text":"If I going to rate Etsu based on their washroom facilities, I would have give Etsu a close to 5 star rating!! Their washrooms are so clean, smell so good (fl orally), so modern (Japanese style help you clean everything?).  If I going to rate Etsu based on their food, I would have give Etsu barely a 3 star. The presentation were good, but all the rolls we ordered just drowned in Mayonnaise, every single roll we ordered.   Black Dragon ($9.95), Etsu ($10.95) and Fire Mountain ($7.95) all tasted similar.. which was kind of disappointing.  Cold Soba ($7.95) was pretty good though.  If I going to rate Etsu based on their decor and services, I would give them a 4 stars. Great friendly and attentive service (though we were the only table there on a Saturday evening!).   So at the end of the meal, I could just rate Etsu as a 3  star.  It is a solid 3 star though!  Lunch Specials maybe?"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious rolls (mainly uramaki) and often tasty nigiri and sashimi. The age tofu (sorry, no dashi) is beautifully deep fried with a tempura sprinkling (not just cornstarch). The miso soup, while almost certainly from a package, is good quality stuff and its heat contrasts wonderfully with the chill of the sushi.   Particularly nice are the salmon, hamachi, and scallops. The variety of fish is not as diverse as Japango or other sushi places, but the quality is higher, and the rolls huge, yummy, and filling.  The ton katsu is good, one of the nicer ones I've had outside of Japan, but nothing to brag about. The tempura yam roll is sweet and tasty.   The service can be slow as they often have only one waitress to serve the usually packed restaurant. She's super nice, helpful, and efficient though.  Overall this place consistently delivers a delicious sushi experience -- a rarity in Toronto.  I always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I was a little bit nervous when I was greeted by a Brobdingnagian yet gently rotating fish acting as an inflatable glowing concierge to this Baldwin Street Japanese joint. But one step inside and my doubts were allayed. Etsu is one of the more stylish spaces on this restaurant strip, with richly-coloured wood floors, glass-and-metal four-tops and some pretty far out artwork. Seated beneath a deep focus photograph of something that resembled a dessicated horse's skull, my three dining companions and I cracked open the impressive menu.  There are a variety of sushi and bento options. Since the owners are Korean, there are plenty of Korean offerings as well including the Sam Kye Tang soup -- a whole-chicken soup which must be ordered 24 hours in advance!  Crippled by the options, we settled on the dinner for four. For fifty-five dollars in total we received: miso soup, an amazing salad, a plate of tempura goodies, an enormous sushi boat, chicken AND beef teriyaki with rice, and green tea ice cream for dessert. It was a humbling amount of food and all of it delicious.  Obligatory Title Pun: I bETS U'll like it!  Menu Readability: Seriously, one of the best menus I have ever seen in a Japanese restaurant.  Need to mention: The dessicated horse's skull isn't as scary as I make it sound.  What this place teaches me about myself: I have a mean sesquipedalian streak sometimes."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed the experience here. Definitely one of Toronto's best and finest. Order the rolls and main dishes and eat till you drop!"}
{"text":"Went to Etsu last night after finding a local deal, which saved me 50% off the dinner special menu. I was very impressed with both the quality of food and service. The restaurant is also decorated with tasteful modern art pieces, making the dining environment overall very pleasant.  We ordered two dinner specials (sashimi/sushi combo and teriyaki beef combo) and a sushi pizza as appetizer. Food came quickly and the waitress was very attentive.  Both and sashimi and teriyaki beef tasted way better than what you'd get in your usual bento affair. For once, the beef was flavourful and non-rubber like. What are the words I'm looking for?....oh yah, soft and buttery. Whoohoo for yummy teriyaki beef!!  I'll be a returning customer. :)"}
{"text":"I bought a travel zoo voucher for Etsu awhile back, and it was a great deal! I hardly ever eat Japanese food downtown, but Etsu has a pretty good reputation in the Baldwin Village. I've previously been here for lunch once, and I was looking foward to trying out dinner.  Our package included a cup of tea. Oddly enough, they don't have the typical green tea, and instead have offerings like Earl Grey, honey ginger tea, and peppermint. I went with Earl Grey, but it was an odd match with the food.   We both started with miso soup and my bf's order included a wakame (seaweed) salad. The salad was very nice and refreshing.   I got the Seoul combo, which started with a kimchi trio instead of the salad. I love kimchi and I really liked that there was a variety.   Our shared appetizer was a sushi pizza- deep fried rice crisp with fresh toppings: salmon, onions, green pepper, and fish roes ($8.95). I loved the thick slices of avocado that topped the pizza. It was a little hard to eat all the components together because the toppings fell off very easily, but everything was delicious.  The rest of my Seoul kalbi combo ($20.95) featured 6 pieces of kalbi, 6 pieces of sushi, and 6 pieces of tempura. I loved my platter of food, but my only complaint was that the sushi became a little warm because it was sitting too close to all the hot food. The kalbi was juicy and tender. I had no complaints at all. But the best part was definitely the tempura, because Etsu uses unconventional ingredients. I couldn't identify half of the battered vegetables that I was eating, but everything was fresh and delicious. My favourite was the banana tempura, which worked remarkably well with the savoury dipping sauce.  My bf opted for Narita sushi and sashimi combo ($20.95) which came with 10 pieces of sashimi, six pieces of sushi, and six pieces of tempura. Everything was fresh and tasty. Both combos came with a bowl of rice, but there was so much food that I couldn't eat much of it at all!  We ended the meal with a small scoop of espresso ice cream. I was happy with the small portion as I was absolutely stuffed at this point. It was the perfect sweet ending to our feast!   I have no regrets in buying the voucher. $29 was a fantastic deal for all that delicious food! I wouldn't drive all the way downtown just to eat at Etsu, but it's a great option if you're around the Baldwin Village area."}
{"text":"This is my Baldwin back-up when Konnichiwa is packed or closed. :P  The food is okay. As others have mentioned, not very authentic. I think their strong suit are the rolls. Great roll combos on their lunch menu. Tempura is pretty good too. Otherwise, noodles and other dishes are okay.  They are not as pricey as their neighbour, Konnichiwa - but if you looking for a cheaper option and if your crowd isn't too picky with Japanese cuisine - Etsu is a good choice."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is perfect! I'm so thankful that my boyfriend found this on Yelp.   The decor was really cute! I definitely was not expecting to see glass tables and ghost chairs when I walked in. The \"exposed brick\" wall was a nice touch, as well as the large chalkboard announcing their First Anniversary since opening. I also enjoyed their selection of music. It was a little odd to hear during the day, but it would be great if you were on a dinner date with someone. :)  Since it was their anniversary, they had a great special which gave every guest who dined in for dinner free hand rolls. This was really cute. I really enjoyed the nice gesture. They also had a special in which you would receive a free Tuna Pizza appetizer if you spend more than $10 on alcohol.  My boyfriend and I ordered a sashimi plate and two bowls of ramen, since we were craving it earlier. Everything tasted really great and fresh. I have to point out how beautiful the presentation was on the sashimi plate though. It was GORGEOUS. I have never seen such a beautifully crafted plate before. That's how you know the chefs really care and take their time. There were edible gold flakes, fruit, and ume plum amongst the different types of fish. Seriously, you have to order it to see. I also enjoyed the little wasabi bottle and ginger jar they supply you with. It's much easier to do that than continually ask for more.  Our server was so nice and delightful. She frequently checked on us to make sure everything was okay, but was not overly attentive.   I'm glad this place is so close to my cousins' house. The prices are right and the food is great. Many many thumbs up!"}
