{"text":"I normally never write reviews but my experience here was so bad that I had to.
My friends and I came for their brunch soft opening and arrived early enough that only a few tables were taken. There were others seated and served after us and, after half an hour of more seats being taken and others getting seated after but served before us, we asked about the progress of our food and were told our food was the next order.
Half an hour later we still hadn't gotten our food and were still being told that our food was on its way and to wait three to five minutes.
Twenty more minutes later, part of our food came out, all cold. We had to remind them about the sides we had ordered, which came out after another fifteen minutes.
The waitresses even began avoiding us after we had been waiting for an hour, and we had to directly approach them about our food.
If our order was forgotten, at least please tell us so we're not expecting our food any minute."}
{"text":"Can I leave a 5 star review from only one visit. You fucking right I can, that how good the Pastrami (East Coast) sandwich was. I really like the layout and vibe of BFH. I use to be a \"two entree type person\" back in not so distant past, I have control these days.... or do I? Because I plan on getting a crazy burger to go along with my next Pastrami. How about a Walnut Street Food Hall? Yeah, bring that shit closer to me!"}
{"text":"What a lovely, open space with just enough variety of options for food and drink! I am so glad Broadway Food Hall exists."}
{"text":"I visited the Broadway Food Hall last Friday for the first time and I liked it but I believe it is a place that needs a lot of work and time to reach its peak. Changing a lot of small details could improve it significantly. For example, the room is too big for the amount of restaurants and the amount of chairs and tables, therefore it becomes too impersonal and has a really ordinary atmosphere. Also the lightning could be changed to make it more welcoming.
As of for the food and service, it was really good and I would happily go back to try another of the restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved the Poke Bowl!  Fresh and the regular size was very large and enough for my dinner!  Parking is awful. We ended up parking on street and walking across tracks.  No signage so you really have to look for it!"}
{"text":"A food court with food you actually want to eat!  Delicious with a fun atmosphere.  Staff is friendly and courteous.   I've been over 5 times tried most of the food booths and I have enjoyed them all.  It's also a great place to take kids.   So happy it's now a part of this community!"}
{"text":"The space is BEAUTIFUL! Working here for a meeting over tea or coffee is wonderful ((hence the two stars rather than one). However, the food is poor. I have visited on four separate occasions, each time hoping that the food quality will be better and leaving each time disappointed. The breakfast is especially limited because it seems like they use all their leftovers to try to make a breakfast sandwich. This may be particularly true for non-meat eaters. For example, on one visit, I was told that they could not serve me because they only had hamburgers. When I asked for just a side of french fries, they said they were unable to only allow me to order a side and I would have to order a burger (but they had no vegetarian options). I will not be returning for a fifth visit."}
{"text":"I'm so enthusiastic about the Broadway Food Hall. There are some logistical things they will work out I'm sure. I've had things from all the venues all delicious. I'm so happy I can get a good pastrami sandwich here in town. The poke bowls were very good and I like the environment. Casual clean attractive friendly service. I look forward to many enjoyable meals. Thanks for being adventurous and yummy."}
{"text":"First time here last weekend. Great spot located in Urbana, IL. You get that nice urban vibe when you walk in. Spacious food hall with tall and short tables, and along the sides and toward the back are comfy couches and coffee tables. I love anywhere with couches for me to hang out at whether I'm there doing work or socially with friends. This was a social visit, so I was really able to enjoy myself and the food while listening to some great rap and hip hop throwbacks - think along the lines of Tribe Called Quest and Mos Def. 

Food options are great, you can get bowls with meat rice and veggies, poke bowls, salads, sandwiches and burgers, you can even get a bowl of pho. What made this spot even better is there is a wine bar at King Kuma. That just made me want to sit there all day to eat and drink on a Saturday. 

Overall great vibe, price is reasonable, food was amazing and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town. WiFi is available, so great place to do work. Check out my photos."}
{"text":"Kind of hidden but sweet spot.  Nice idea without the mall.  Many varieties of food to choose.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Had the sampler right when it opened. The burger was fine, and the salad was solid. What really makes this place worth it are the more interesting offerings. The poke bowl was interesting and delicious, with quality tuna in a flavorful sauce. The pastrami sandwich was top notch, and probably had the highest quality deli meat I've had in the CU area so far.

The best part is that there is not a food experience quite like this in the area. It's original and adds variety.

I would recommend the place, and I look forward to being back soon."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in C-U in my opinion! Super huge, well decorated space right in the heart of Urbana. The food hall is made up of 5 different places you can order food from. All the food is delicious! I'd recommend Muchacho, which is a Chipotle-style Korean fusion place, and Nation, which has amazing pastrami sandwiches! AND they also have amazing poke! Seriously, no matter what the occasion is- if you are by yourself, on a date, or with a big group, this is probably gonna be your best option in Urbana. Just try it out. The parking lot isn't huge and it might not look that amazing from the outside but it is well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out with friends or on a casual date! Our favorite spot is the poke bowl place. Really fresh ingredients and quick service. Its definitely the priciest option here, but you're paying for fresh fish in central Illinois, so I think its very worth it. It's also especially worth it when you wash it down with a cold beer from the tap. Its family friendly, so picture lots of kids running around, big groups, communal tables, and just a louder environment all together. That may or may not be and ideal setting for you depending on what your crowd is like. We love it for that reason, because it's so relaxed and open it's great for a warm night out!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Broadway Food Hall for poke bowls at King Kuma! They are very generous with their servings and the service is always very kind and quick. I would recommend the tuna poke bowl, though the salmon and tofu bowls are also excellent. Their sushi rolls are also very delicious when they are offered!

I have also attended a few of the events here, including their wine tastings and private social gatherings. The venue is great for a crowd and there are different offerings to please all palates! If you have the opportunity to attend an event - public or private - don't hesitate. 

Lunch rush is real here. While parking is a little hard on the lot, there is plenty of street parking available. Because of the several offerings inside, the lines typically move quickly, and you usually would never have a longer wait than 5-10 minutes (at most!). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love Broadway. I work in downtown Urbana and this has become a staple lunch spot for my coworkers and me. Great food, a variety of food choices while still maintaining a specific vibe, unique bottled/canned drinks (and free cucumber water!). And booze! My favorite lunches are the Hawaiian Heat poké bowl and the Reuben, but ask me in 6 weeks and I may have a new answer."}
{"text":"If you've been to Revival Food Hall In Chicago this is basically a small scale version. It's a great concept because a group of friends can go and each get whatever type of food they want. We had the wings (Thursday wing special) and egg salad sandwich. There is also a place to get salad, a breakfast place, and a bar area. I would have liked it if this place was open later, as it is a great space for people hang out and share some good food."}
{"text":"This is such a unique place to eat! I can here for lunch and got the Tuna Poke bowl and was blown away! Everything tasted fresh and delicious! There are 5 options of different places to eat and is set up similar to a food court. I will definitely be back for more of the goodies offered here!"}
{"text":"Such a cute, artsy atmosphere. I loved the concept of having a communal dining space shared by a few different vendors. Each vendor has a section along the wall. Although they each have an individual style, all their decor have a hipster flair to it. There was a nice couch area with an extra large chess set that we played with after our meal!

[Fried Rice Bowl, from Muchacho] This vendor served Korean / Mexican fusion. I really enjoyed the mix of kimchi fried rice and steak. The spinach, pickled cucumbers, grilled bell pepper, and other veggies were great additions to the meal. I topped my bowl off with ginger sesame sauce. It wasn't anything mind blowing but I enjoyed it!

[Chocolate Milk, from La Royale] I loved the presentation of this vendor space. The bright yellows and the artsy egg posters were super inviting. The chocolate milk wasn't too sweet. It was just right!"}
{"text":"New favorite eatery in CU! We got large poke for two (with avocado added), one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic drink, and some ice cream for around $40 after tip. Fun, casual environment and awesome food! We're from Oregon, and it totally reminded us of Portland's food halls."}
{"text":"Broadway Food Hall is a very hip spot. I like the concept of an indoor cafeteria surrounded by different vendors - it's something that is a great addition to Champaign-Urbana. I came here for the wings night on Thursday, and I stayed for awhile just chilling and enjoying the wings."}
{"text":"Great lunch location! There's so much variety so there's always something for everyone. The large seating area is a plus. The food is awesome. The pastrami is amazing and a must-try. It's definitely a place to stop by when you feel like treating yourself for lunch."}
{"text":"What a neat concept: 5 different food shops with communal seating. This way, everyone can eat what they want. I recently visited for an early weekday lunch. I ordered a regular poke bowl from King Kuma, which doesn't look like a lot of food for $10, but it is densely packed with fresh, hand-prepared ingredients. Plus I still had room for a chocolate milkshake from La Royale (which was acceptable but by no means life changing). Look out: the wasabi is the real deal. My companion ordered a Mexican-Korean bowl from Muchado. Although he was impressed by the Red Dragon sauce when he was allowed to taste test it before ordering, he reported that the final product was rather bland once the other components were added. He got a vanilla milkshake. One of the servers bused our table, and by the time we left in the middle of the lunch hour, the small parking lot was full. Given the amount of seating inside, I guess they assume local business people will walk over. I hope so, as I want this enterprise to succeed."}
{"text":"The place and people are awesome. Great casual atmosphere for a quick bite. But the convenience doesn't detract from the service or the food. Great selection with really fresh ingredients. I'll be a regular for the poke bowl alone!"}
{"text":"We started coming here a few months ago and has become our favorite spot for poke!  Poke has been growing in popularity in Champaign and I can easily say this is our favorite.  Ingredients are always fresh and you get a very large bowl.  There's a \"king\" sized bowl but the regular bowl is always very filling.  If you love poke this is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I would consider this place a very \"up and coming\" spot in C-U. First, the concept. Think food court only more attention to flavor and quality. If you've been the Revival Food Hall in Chicago, Broadway Food Hall wants to grow up to be that. I really like the choices - enough diversity but nothing that an urban midwestern palate would be scared to try. The choices include a burger bar, a salad bar, a hot and cold deli menu, a burrito bowl station that has an Asian/Mexican flare, and a wine bar combined with...wait for it...a poké bar!!!! If you've never had poké and have an aversion to raw fish, a poké bowl is where you start to face that fear! It is usually served with rice and then any combination of other toppings and the raw tuna is marinated, so it has a smoky soy flavor. I took a picture of the menu, so you can see there are unlimited combos to please anyone. 

Next, comments about the meals we had. First, I should add the caveat that we forgot that the Hall closed at 3, and we walked through the doors at 2:50 pm. I used to work in restaurants, and I really NEVER thought I'd be THAT person. Ugh! Once I realized the situation, I told the person who greeted us (one of the partners) that I forgot they closed at 3, and didn't realize how late it was, and that we would just take a quick look around and come back another time. He wouldn't hear of it! He said he would be happy to help us, and took time to explain the setup. My husband had a roast beef combo which came with a drink and bagged potato chips (choice of plain, bbq, sour cream and onion). The drink choices were Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Orange and water. The drinks came in a 16 oz can (instead of the standard 12 oz. size), and were cold, but not served with a glass or ice, which I prefer. I had a burrito bowl with several choices of ingredients, including (for no extra charge), fried tuna! The burrito bowls had some very interesting add-ins that changed the flavor up in a surprising and delicious way. For example, one of the add-ins was a mild radish-type vegetable that was marinated in something that made it sweet. I loved both the flavor and the crunch. Overall, my husband thought his sandwich was good, but not exceptional. My Asian/Mexican fusion bowl was, in fact, exceptional. 

Things I liked:
Combination of food venue choices
Price point (around $10 per full meal with drink)
The contemporary industrial yet comfortable ambiance (although might get pretty noisy with a huge crowd)
The simplicity of the ordering system
Quality of the food
Favorite feature: poké bar!! (No others in C-U to my knowledge)
Customer service was beyond exceptional. I felt like the partner I spoke with was personally vested in making this a successful project.

Suggestions:
A wider variety of drink choices, and include the option for cups and ice
Offer the option of real silverware
Eventually add a self-serve fro-yo bar or something sweet
SIGNAGE!! If it were mine, I would hire a mural painter to paint a colorful \"Broadway Food Hall\" on the white building front. 

All in all, a very good start to a wonderful addition for C-U. I will be back to try the poké bar soon! The partner said they are planning to extend hours once the weather warms up."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the atmosphere!! Reasonable prices for delicious food. Come here and support local business!"}
{"text":"Very fun night out ! Live music and board games included. My only complaint is that I wish they stayed open later!"}
{"text":"This food hall has a nice vibe to it- a minimalist design. Not the most comfortable seats, but definitely a great open environment. Only downside to the setting would be the lack of sunlight around the center of the hall. Came here on the food tasting day, trying out samples from the various vendors. The pastrami was surprisingly good, juicy and flavorful while not too overwhelming. The sashimi for the poke bowl tasted fresh, pretty generous with the amount. The burger was average- seemed a bit imbalanced with a slightly thick bun and a lot of veggie condiments. Kimchi fried rice with chicken was nice, the sauce elevated the taste. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept! The place is beautifully designed and laid out. There's plenty of room for a big group and wish such a good range of options, I'm sure everyone will find something they like. Personally, I'm so pumped to finally have poke in this town! The pastrami was amazing as well. Can't wait to come back and try the rest!"}
{"text":"I love the poke bowls at King Kuma! I love the freshness of the food. Muchcacho has amazing Korean-Mexican fusion bowls. La Royale has traditional diner fare; our 3 & 5 year olds love the grilled cheese and milkshakes. Nation has sandwiches, but what I love are the Thursday Night wings. They are so crispy and jumbo to boot! And it's nice they have local brews on tap- pairs well with my meal!"}
