{"text":"I went for brunch and didn't think it was anything special. The portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for Summerlicious yesterday. It was possibly the worst Summerlicious experience we have ever had. Considering the restaurant is in the Park Hyatt we expected way more. The service felt rushed, inattentive and lacked finesse. The servers barely smiled; they were sullen and seemed tired and genuinely unhappy to be there. It's the little details that matter at fine dining establishments. For example, the server filled the glass of water to the top and it spilled over onto the table. My friend had to ask for a straw ad she couldn't lift up the glass without it spilling over.

On to the food. We got the shrimp appetizers. The shrimp were way overdone,  however thr flavor was ok. For our mains we got the steak. I have never had worse steak in my life. The flavor of the meat was off, it lacked seasoning and came topped with some kind of beans that were soaked in what I believe was vinegar. We both managed to finish less than half. The best part of the meal was the dessert. It was a pistachio and strawberry cake. Light and airy, thankfully we ended our subpar meal on a somewhat pleasant note. 

The valet parking seemed completely disorganized and the staff were unfriendly in general. Step your game up Park Hyatt. Whatever happened to fine dining hospitality...?"}
{"text":"I came here during my stay at the Park Hyatt Toronto (next door). I was very happy about the gluten free options on the menu. I ordered the gluten free breakfast salad- which was AMAZING. It had two pouched eggs on top, with cut up potatoes tomatoes, bacon, cheddar, and cucumbers. All perfectly diced up and sized. The dressing on the top of the salad was some sort of lemon citrus dressing that was light and perfect."}
{"text":"Our party just had the worst experience ever in downtown. It is all because of the bad attitude of the restaurant manager. He did a horrible job when we trying to figure out something about the bills. His attitude is simply too rude. I never say this about any person before but for this one, I Hope he will get fired soon! He as one person totally ruin that restaurants reputation!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto from New York and my sister and her family decided to treat us for brunch.  It was during the summerlicious week.  We had a big table, probably 9 altogether.  We were a little late and when we stepped in, we weren't greeted by the hostess.  Instead she looked rather concerned and asked us right away, \"How many more kids are coming?\".  I thought that was quite odd, we only had two kids (ages 5 and 7) with us and the reservation would have that information.  We then sat down, waited for 10 min and no one handed us kids' menus.  So then I realized perhaps the purpose of the hostess' question was not to see how many kids' menus she needed to get, but to gauge whether our table was going to destroy the restaurants' ambience.  
We visit Toronto a lot and we frequently go to the bar on the ground floor at the Four Seasons with our kids (even after dinner in the evenings because they have great desserts) and never have we felt unwelcome by the host or wait staff.  
The food was very mediocre.  I don't know if it has to do with summerlicious.  The flatbread was stale and not crispy - the ones we usually buy from Pusateri's were way better.
If it wasn't my sister's idea, we would have gone to a much better place.  There are so many great choices in Toronto for Sunday brunch.  I would not go to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"3 / 5 for those that are health conscious! This is the first upscale restaurant with so many good healthy options. For starters, I recommend the BEEF & CABBAGE POTSTICKERS or RIPE TRI-COLOUR TOMATOES WITH FETA & OREGANO (both are small portions). As a main, the GRILLED SEAFOOD SALAD is definitely a fantastic option. If you prefer a brunch option (eggs), I highly recommend the CRAB CAKE BENEDICT.  Overall, I am not a huge fan of hotel restaurants, but I must say that this was one of the better ones."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here for winterlicious 2017 and I must say we were blown away by the ambience and service alone.. yes, its a fancy restaurant but the service was on par with the ambience. our server took excellent care of us and the food we ordered all came in on time one after the other so there was no long wait time.. we started off with complimentary feta bread that came with fig which we enjoyed...we really liked the scallops appetizer.. my friend got the lettuce salad (not too impressed with that) .. we both got the Icelandic cod for our mains.. the fish was a bit salty and the beans were kind of hard (this is the only part of the meal where I thought it could've been done better).. the desert.. omg the desert alone was amazing! I ordered the sampler which came with an apple rosette tart, sour cream ice cream on a cookie, praline mouse and snap cookie, and oreo cheesecake - ALL AMAZING! my friend ordered the maple crème brulee - also AMAZING! overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the place to splurge a little and if you want to be pampered at the same time. Located on the Ground Floor of the Park Hyatt Hotel.
Can be a little expensive, but with careful ordering + drinking the price can be worth while for that special occasion. Check out some special $49 per person menu's on Fri/Sta/Sun evenings throughout November, and also Afternoon High Tea (3-5pm daily) a nice break after all that \"window shopping\" on Bloor Street, West of Bay."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a business lunch. There are always people in the restaurant, but the tables are spaced really well so you feel like you can have a personal conversation and still have a bit of chatter in the background. 

Service is attentive and accommodating.

The food is consistent and tasty. The prairie club is a favourite. The lobster grilled cheese is fun, but could use a little more lobster to make it feel worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations because it was recommended by my dining companion and, well, it is the Park Hyatt after all.

The hostess was very nice, but I felt bad for her when she noticed that I had to wipe the crumbs off my chair before I sat down. She was visibly embarrassed. The serving staff were quite good and took our food allergy concerns seriously and made the appropriate accommodations.

We chose the prix fixe beef tartare and haddock main. My friend had an okay tart, but my maple creme brûlée was really good. I'm sorry to say that the best part of the food was the dessert I had. The beef tartare was unremarkable but the haddock was just awful. It was overcooked, overly salty and there was so many other things on the plate with strong flavours, that the fish was overwhelmed by them and couldn't compete.

I think this place would be fine for drinks, but I wouldn't come here again for the food, especially given the price we paid. I've had much better food for way less cash."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great service. Food is amazing! Have been going there for special occasions for many years and would give it top marks. Took one star off for the expensive prices."}
{"text":"Nice place, exquisite food and lovely service.
We went there for a celebration of our anniversary.
Thanks to the all the elements there, the night ended up being all I wanted it to be. 
I would definitely go again there for future celebrations."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times. It has maintained its standard all along.  With the Summerlicious going in, even we book a table but we arrive early at 5:30pm.  We order freshly squeezed orange juice. It is very good though a bit expensive at $9 a glass. We talk a while before the waiter comes to take our orders. 

The appetizer Baby Lobster grilled cheese is exceptionally good. I am not a cheese eater but still has to give it a Kudo. The Rib eye steak is perfect medium rare. The texture is tender and juicy. The Sea bass is good, grilled on one side and moist on the other. If I have to chose between these two, I would recommend for the steak. We are given 2 choices for the dessert.  Seldom is such offer being given. The best is the Chocolate lava cafe. It is delicious and once you cut it, the chocolate lava just melt and flowing out like lava. I like the meringue part of the Lemon meringue pie. The Sorbet seems like to be pear. 

The service is good. After we have our drinks, bread is forgotten to be served. The waiter is smart to note that we look around at other tables which all are just served with bread.  He immediately go and get us a basket. For other restaurants at Summerlicious, I have experience rush rush rush.   But here our treatment is as if we are served in a normal manner in a high class restaurant. This restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Annona is a quaint naturally lit restaurant and makes a perfect breakfast or brunch spot.  This restaurant is in the beautiful appointed hotel of Park Hyatt of Toronto. 

My fiancee and went here on the weekend to enjoy a Winterlicious lunch. 

Service was very good, with the servers only a beckons call a way. I like that they are not overtly hovering the table or trying to aggressively upsell you on other items.

To start , for our appetizers 

-Shrimp, Squash & Manchego Empanada
Avocado Lime Dipping Sauce
-Spinach, Ciel des Charlesvoix & chilli maple roasted walnuts
Warm Bacon, Cranberry Vinaigrette (vegetarian)

Our mains:

-Rice Paper Wrapped Halibut
Curried Broth, Braised Green Lentils, Thin Cut Vegetables 
-Horseradish Glazed Beef Brisket
Crunchy Mustard & Dill Pickle Gravy, Root Vegetable Mash

Desserts:

-Walnut Butter Tart
Dark Chocolate Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream
-Apple Buttercream Roll
Crisp Apple, Caramel Sauce, Crème Anglaise


Your taste experience depends entirely on what you order but overall everything is prepared quite well. The ambiance lives up to our expectations of gourmet dining. 

The verdict on the food as I mentioned your tastes depends on entirely what you order. For what I've ordered, I didn't like the preparation of the beef. It tasted marinated in vinegar and cured like a ham. The butter apple roll tasted dry. However the spinach salad I ordered tasted quite good. The bacon topped spinach and cheese and walnuts on the side made for a unique flavorful salad. 

For my fiancee's meal, the empanada's were delicious, crisp and the avocado dressing went perfectly with the seafood filling inside. The halibut was a little bit dry other than that the light curried broth with the rice paper wrapped halibut was a unique combination that turned out well. The sharply pointed triangled shaped butter tart was a perfect way to end the meal not being overly sweet especially since it was topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce. 

Annona is a good restaurant. We love the ambiance, preparation and locale. The food however did not shine in all aspects. There were some highlights and low lights to the food. Maybe we'll give it another try but the first time around it was average. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the complimentary bread - quite amazing. While the atmosphere and service were amazing, the food was not up to the hype. Both my halibut and my girlfriend's risotto were far too salty. And this wasn't just too flavorful, this was straight up far too salty. Nonetheless, the experience was enjoyable. And from what I heard their afternoon tea is quite popular so that will definitely be up next on the list."}
{"text":"My first hightea experience was here at Annona, the restaurant in the Park Hyatt Yorkville.  From reservation to the moment I left, I could say the service from the staff and the manager was flawless.

For tea, we chose the Lemon Mango Tango - The Zesty Lemons balance the sweetness of the Mangos and the White Tip Daejeeling - This \"Champagne of Black Teas\" is Treasured for its Ripe, Complex Flavour & Floral Bouquet.

We alsp got a flute of Santa Margherita Prosecco to start.  It's no celebration without some sparkling wine!

 Our finger sandwiches & canapes were spectacular:

- Crispy Cone of Cranberry, Boursin & Chopped Walnuts
- Smoked Salmon & Chive Cream Cheese Torte on Pumpernickel
- Asparagus & Chicken Mousse Crepe Pinwheel
- Cheddar & Watercress Pinwheel on Wholewheat
- Cucumber & Carrot on White 

Both of our favourites was the Crispy Cone.  The different texture and flavours just exploded in my mouth!

 Of course, tea time is not complete without our tiered plates of scones & tea pastries.  Not only do these delectable goodies are presented well, they tasted so good as well.  In this case, yes you can judge the book by it's cover.

M I N I A T U R E S C O N E S

Classic Clotted Cream & Fruit Preserves

T E A P A S T R I E S

The miniature scones were the best I have ever had.  The shell was soft and the inside was buttery and fluffy.  Such perfection!

Had such a good time. I suggest coming here for a celebration or mother's day - you are guaranteed to feel special with their amazing service and delectable food."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner. Staff was very friendly and professional. Really enjoyed the crab cakes and lobster bisque. My wife had the surf and turf while I had lamb -  both excellent dishes. Dessert was excellent as well, their lava cake is very popular for a good reason."}
{"text":"We usually shy away from hotel eateries; however in an area of town that provides unique challenges of choice, we took a chance.  In a word, the meal was memorable.  While the menu was somewhat limited, everything was done to perfection - topped off by 1st class service and a deep fairly priced wine list."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant - amazing fresh bread with feta cheese and olive to start the meal. My main course salmon was moist and nicely charred. Service is 5 star. They know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Annona for high tea, a-no-thanks.

I busted out my fancy hat for high tea at Annona.  I was with a large group and we had reservations for 2:30 in the afternoon.

Don't get me wrong, the service was courteous and attentive as expected  
But enough small hiccups became frustrating.

They didn't have our table ready.
It's the afternoon and not busy at all, but we had to wait outside while they scrambled to get set-up for about 10 minutes.

Once we were seated, we were presented with the afternoon tea menu.
The high tea here is amongst the cheapest in the city but you're also not in a tearoom.  ($26 regular tea service, sparkling tea service is $35 with Prosecco) 

The menu has a selection of teas: Earl Grey, BC inspired piney teas, Jasmine and Green teas, I opted for the White Tip Darjeeling which they describe as the \"champagne of black teas\".

About 40 minutes after ordering, half of the group's tea arrived.  
My tea was one of the last to arrive even though I ordered first.

Tea Attempt #1:
I poured my tea through the filter and it was full of tiny little bits too small for the filter.  I asked for the pot to be replaced.

The two people sitting around me ordered the same tea at the same time and had no problem.

Tea Attempt #2
About 10 minutes later my teapot came back.
The lid still had  tiny tea bits on it.  Obviously the same unwashed pot.
I poured it through the filter, same problem!  I don't think they changed the tea at all.

I called the manager over.  He apologized and took the teapot away again.

Tea Attempt #3
The manager brings over a new teapot with tea.
I lift the lid and it's clean.  I peer in at the leaves and they are the right size.  He says the reason my other pot was bad was that the water was too cold (That's a horrible reason).
I think they just used the end of the package.  

He started to pour my tea, it poured fine.  I told him to stop pouring so the tea could steep.

How long does it take to get a cup of tea?  An hour.

Food
====
The food arrived.
There aren't side tables, which is a nice-to-have for more space.

* The bread for the salmon and pumpernickel had been re-toasted and was cold and stale.
* The shrimp and cucumber bite was the best savory item 
* There were a few other sandwich bites that weren't anything really exciting

Desserts
=======
They didn't change our plates.  That really annoyed me.

The best part of the dessert was the clotted cream.

The desserts were served on a small 3-tier tower which was cute.
There are a few types of mini scones: Currant, orange, plain.
They were dry and had been sitting for a while.  We ran out of jam.
They didn't check to see if we needed more and we had to ask.

The best tea pastry was the fruit custard tartlet.  
There was a bite of carrot cake, chocolate cake.  
The chocolate cake was very dry and made me sad.

Unfortunately, high tea here fell very short of my expectations.
I might be back for a regular meal, but definitely not for tea."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  My husband and I went there for breakfast as it's the only time we get to go out \"child-free\" as our son is in a half day care program.  The food and service are both fantastic.  They have a gluten free selection and some organic items.  I had the breakfast tasting menu and my husband had the pancakes.  We loved both.  We were especially happy with the super flaky croissants and the warm maple syrup.  It's refreshing to see some hotel restaurants not using the \"standard\" breakfast fare of eggs and meat."}
{"text":"I have to write a review. My friends and I went there during winterlicious for lunch. We ordered almost every course on the menu except vegetarian ones. They were disappointing. They didnt even serve us bread. The service was great though."}
{"text":"4.5/5
My gf and I came here for dinner, during Winterlicious. What made me choose this restaurant was their selection for dinner. It was consistent and I wanted to try everything on the menu. Even though, I already knew what I was going to order. The ambience of the restaurant was great. The hostess (I wish I got her name. She was very accommodating). She took our jackets and was very friendly.
For the appetizer, I got the French Onion Soup. I've had a lot of French Onion Soup. Although it may be visually appealing, with all the cheese, I base the soup on the broth. There was only one place I thoroughly enjoyed it at (Which was Colette. Their soup was made with beef oxtail) whereas other places, it lacks the flavour of the beef broth. Annona's French Onion Soup was good, had flavour (Onions were overpowering, which to me is a good thing. I love onions) but I just wish it had more of that beef broth flavour. 
For the main course, I got the Char-Grilled Beef Medallions, cooked rare. I was certainly pleased to see that the beef was cooked rare. 
For dessert, I had the Chocolate All The Way. Which was a layered chocolate roulade genoise, with couverture mousse, cassis gelee, cassis cubes, gold nugget, blackberries, chocolate sauce (Taken from the Winterlicious site, because I don't know how to describe it). I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Hence the 4.5/5 rating. Should've had the Maple Creme Brulee instead.
Other than that, our waiter was attentive, friendly and quite possibly, set a record for how often he came back to pour ice water into our glasses. We didn't have to ask! (We like to stay hydrated). I'd definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Annona was pretty memorable so I get into a 'happy place' whenever Annona is mentioned.

I was here 2 years ago for my friend's engagement party for Afternoon Tea ($28) which was very elegant, delicious and filling.  It was also very eventful as we didn't realize it was the first weekend of TIFF and we got to see a few famous people going in and out of the Park Hyatt while we ate - Dinner and a Show(ish)... I'm talking Collin Farrell, Paul Haggis, Seth Rogen and Jason Statham!

This year a few co-workers and I decided to go to Annona for a Summerlicious lunch.  FYI, if you ever want to reserve a 'licious meal here, book early as they fill up pretty fast. 

I had:
Appetizer - Arancini (Shrimp, sundried tomato & mascarpone with lemon aioli)
Very flavourful! Nice and crispy outside.
Main - Char-grilled Sirloin Steak (with cauliflower smashed potatoe & asparagus)
I asked for a medium, but it was a touch overcooked, still good flavour.
Dessert - White chocolate basil Panna Cotta (with raspberry compote & pistachio crisp)
the panna cotta was a little too firm, but flavour was top notch! Not overly sweet.
Got to try the Chocolate truffle Jubilee which was good but too sweet both my co-workers couldn't finish their dessert.

It's a miracle we were able to get back to work and not fall asleep, food portions were generous... Food Coma!

Location is perfect, on Avenue near Bloor.  Great for people watching (even if they're not famous people).  Service was polite and quick, just what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so we took the kids out for High Tea at the Park Hyatt in Yorkville again and this time I took pictures.  Not of the tea segment but of the food.  We have had dinner at Annona before and the Dover Sole was to die for.  Anyway that's not why I am writing this.  I find Annona to be extreme high end dining to the point of almost having an uncomfortable air.  The food however is so good that we return a few times during the year prepared to deal with the...pretension? 

High tea at Annona is one of the most affordable in the city and you can enjoy it everyday between 3pm and 5pm.  Annona gets their tea from Vancouver company simply called \"T.\"  I enjoyed the EROS blend  which was sweet and creamy.  After tea I enjoyed an orange mimosa with prosecco and made using their hand squeezed orange, tangerine and I think mandarin oranges.

We had a Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich made with lobster, aged white cheddar, brioche and purée of roasted tomato soup.  This was one of the best grill cheeses I have ever bought but I could also say that about the ones I make at home when I have had a few.  High end grill cheese to me is not something I would repeat as I see it as unnecessary.  I had this same feeling when eating Kobe Beef Har-Gau dim sum at Lai Wah Heen.  It was good but high end dim sum did not translate for me.  The roasted tomato soup was creamy, sweet and tart.  A perfect dipping vessel.

Their duck confit was laden with flavour, served with perfectly soft gnocchi and brussel sprouts.  They then had the audacity to cover the dish with the richest, most flavourful reduction that I would only expect from a hotel restaurant.  Rich, buttery and complex.  You know that feeling where you are not sure what is in your mouth but you like it?  That kinda good."}
{"text":"We had the summerlicious lunch in Annona. I felt it was just so-so. The soup was even not as good as I cook by myself, the flavor was too simple, could be better with some fresh herb. The trout was good, but one of the long bean in side dish was bit by worm. The chocolate lava cake was OK."}
{"text":"This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life for three reasons: unbelievably delicious food, amazing service...and somebody else picked up the tab. If you read my review of the Park Hyatt, you'll see I was lucky enough to attend an all-expenses paid conference at the hotel for work; we kicked off the meetings with dinner at Annona.

The restaurant had a set menu for us. My appetizer was a mixed greens salad with beets in a light dressing. That may not sound like much, but Annona managed to take something fairly simple and make it extraordinary. For a main I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was served over wild rice and a mixed-veggie salsa. I love seafood, and this was out-of-this-world fantastic. Another main offered was steak, which most of my colleagues ordered and which was raved about by said colleagues for most of the week. A word of warning -- Annona is truly the place to turn any diner into a major critic. Every restaurant we went to from then on was rated as \"good...but not as good as Annona.\"  And for dessert?  A lovely platter of little cakes and goodies. Most people went for the chocolate lava cakes (which were also raved about for the next week), which was fine by me since I got more than my fair share of creamy hazelnut ice cream. 

And the wine!  I don't know what kind it was, but like the meal, it was hands down the best I've ever had. A fruity white wine, not too sweet, and went down so smoothly. My glass was constantly refilled by one of the servers, and that just made it even better. I'm no expert in wine, but one of my coworkers worked for a winery in the Okanogen Valley and agreed that it was fantastic. 

If you're looking for a restaurant to go for a special meal, save your pennies and splurge at Annona."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Annona during Summerlicious with a group of friends. $45/ person. The ceviche was great but small. I had the vegetable and leaf salad which was delicious. My husband got the halibut which I thought was slightly bland. I got the rib eye steak which was perfectly cooked with a side of potatoes both delicious. The dessert lacked a punch. The citrus sensation was way to citrusy! The sorbet was just ok but came with fruit which I liked. The chocolate mousse left me wanting for more. 
The ambiance was nice and the food was alright. I didnt get what the hype is about this place and why it is so expensive. You could cook yourself a similar meal."}
{"text":"For Winterlicious this year, my family and I tried Annona. Having read the reviews I expected the quality we received, but I was hoping that my expectations would have been surpassed. 3 stars for the service and the food. The ambience is decent, but nothing special. Feels like a regular restaurant. It's on the first floor of the hotel, so there isn't much of a view. Like always, I wished the patrons looked like they actually put some effort into their appearance. This definitely takes away from the atmosphere.

Since it was the 3 of us, we ordered different things and taste tested from each other's plates. I ordered the Beef and Cabbage Pot Stickers (essentially beef dumplings), Korean Braised Shortrib, and the Baked Lemon Tart. My family also ordered the soup of the day, which was Butternut squash and lentil, and the Baby Kale and Miso Salad for the appetizers, the Salmon Gratinee with Lobster, and the Dark Chocolate Cherry Millefieulle. The table also came with flatbread, bread (with a cheesy center, real cheese), and tapenade. 

My pot stickers were good, I enjoyed them. None of us really liked the soup, it lacked flavour/spices. The salad was alright, but nothing special. It was essentially kale with sesame seed dressing, with a few pieces of tangerine and mushroom. The short rib was decent. The meat was soft, appeared to have been marinated, and enjoyable. However, it came with plain white rice that had absolutely no spices, and I really expected more from such an establishment. The salmon was delicious, but came with max a tablespoon of mashed potatoes, and hardly had any lobster. The lemon tart was something that you could really get anywhere, and the cherry millefieulle was very chocolatey if you like that sort of thing. Honestly, I've had better food at Moxies. The presentation was fancy shmancey, but the quality and the taste was not. The salmon was better than most restaurants, but everything else was lacking for a hotel restaurant. 

The service was lacking as well. Our server couldn't answer my questions well about the menu (perhaps because English wasn't his first language?), he never asked if we wanted something to drink, after we ordered something to drink we had to ask for our desserts (after waiting for close to half an hour), and even though I specified a fresh pot of coffee, he poured me the end of the pot (coffee ended before it filled my cup), so I asked for a fresh cup. The bartender prepared great B52 coffee's that my mom and grandma enjoyed. 

I would eat here again if I had to, but I wouldn't be especially excited about it."}
{"text":"Went there during winterlicious. Loved our meal! They run like a well oiled machine over there. I loved the bread they brought to the table. The food was delicious and so well presented I had to take a picture of our desserts! Excellent steak, cooked to perfection. Very nice atmosphere for a romantic dinner or to bring guests to impress."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  Service was subpar; food was overcooked; the waiter brought us the bill minutes after serving our desserts.  We will not come here again.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I went for afternoon tea with my girl friends. 
Everything was just very ordinary and nothing special. 

Since it's only $28 for a tea set per person, i guess we got what we paid for.

It is in good location and quiet. Good place to hang out with frds if you dont have high expectation for the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have an impromptu high tea today.  First, we went to the Four Seasons and unfortunately they were full.  We walked over to the Park Hyatt and saw a lot of availability in the restaurant.  This is where things get thumbs down.

The hostess asked us for our reservation and we informed her we had no reservations to which she replied: \"WELL, for next time you always need a reservation!  This time I will do it for you.\"  Then we walk into the seating area - it is NEARLY EMPTY.  How gracious of you to help us out by seating us in your empty restaurant!

The tea was delish but the pots leaked all over the place.  We weren't given pots that matched the pattern (Royal Albert) but the other tables were.  

The sandwiches were delicious and unique.  The deserts were pretty good - I enjoyed the selection of jams and mini-scones.  They also brought out more hot water for our tea, which was nice.

BAD: they don't give you a new plate or cutlery for the dessert portion.  So some of my sweet treats tasted like beef carpaccio, not cool.  And the service was very slow.  When we finished it felt like an eternity before we could get our bill.

Next time, we're going elsewhere.  Don't get me wrong, we were thankful for the last minute seating on a Saturday afternoon but will know better for next time."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, my husband and I ended up at Annona for afternoon tea by process of elimination, but I'm happy we did. 

A word about afternoon tea, first - we go about once a year, and it's always a relaxing, indulgent luxury.  We want good tea and as much attention to presentation and ambiance as to the food.  It's gotta feel elegant and pretty, or it's just thirty or forty bucks for a pot of tea and some nibbles.

After a few weeks of desperate, shoulder-tightening sleep-denying stress, we decided to treat ourselves to a massage-and-tea day.  However, this was easier said than done: the Library Bar doesn't serve on weekdays anymore (bah) and the Windsor Arms tearoom was booked up three days past our date.  The King Eddie doesn't even serve on weekdays anymore.  We decided to give Annona a whirl.  What the heck?

I was pleasantly surprised.  Though it's served in a dining room and not a tearoom, it was still a lovely place for tea - rich blue walls and blue velvet seating, lots of natural light from big windows overlooking the lobby entrance and Avenue Rd., and attractive wood trim.  It was miles better than the time the King Eddie stuck us in a sterile modern-white dining room.  There were a few other occupied tables, but it was midweek-quiet.

The service was pleasant and formal, though not cringing like that one guy at Windsor Arms (pace W.A., your scones are unchallenged).  The music - an etherial pop singer or something -  was fine, though I'd prefer some jazz and classical piano.  We had plenty of elbow room, which I like.

The tea menu was solid, with the English standards, a couple of herbals, a green, and a jasmine white tea.  I always like to see a floral black tea (with rose or lavender) but that's a personal preference and may be weird of me.  A non-floral white tea might also be a good addition.

My prosecco arrived with a martini glass of cut sweet-tart strawberries - a lovely touch, though the luscious, ripe ones currently at farmer's markets would have pushed it over into amazing.  Then the tea, proper heavy silver strainers (I adore those, and it doesn't feel like afternoon tea without them), and the milk.  The sugar was already on the table: brown and white cubes and packets of free-running sugar and substitutes.  A sugar bowl would have been more traditional, though I'm sure some people appreciate the selection.  The tea service was a satisfyingly silly pink thing decorated with birds and flowers and whatnot, and it brightened up the table perfectly.  The set's modern lines offset the pink and meshed with the rest of the room's decor.  The cutlery was heavy silver.

The sandwiches were elegant and a bit weird, as tea sandwiches tend to be. I adored the richness of the boursin-cranberry-walnut cone, though my husband was put off by it.  The cheddar-and-cress pinwheel started off nice, but a flavour I couldn't identify became too dominant.  I liked the inevitable salmon sandwich much more than usual, though it was a vasty substantial thing with a half-caper the size of an olive on top and a too-gooey rippling layer of cream cheese on top.  The mouthfeel was a bit odd, but I can't deny it was delicious.  The carrot-und-hummus was elegant and practically unnoticeable. I can't speak to the chicken, as I kindly traded it to my smoked-salmon-hating husband.

The desserts arrived in a tiered stand.  There was Greaves jam and a good-sized pot of clotted cream each.  We are clotted cream barbarians, but there was even enough for us.  I was unsure about the miniature scones at first, but it worked out well - the smaller size allowed us to eat almost all our pastries and still heap clotted cream on our tiny scones.   The macaron was super-sweet and one-note, but the nutty white chocolate-mint layer cake was a surprising standout - subtle and sweet and minty.  I never got around to the pistachio-crusted eclair, but my husband like it very much.

Then there was the bill, which was significantly lighter than at the top-drawer places (about $30 as opposed to $40). Annona may not be the best in town, but we had a really nice time, it felt like afternoon tea, and I could happily return here on a weekday."}
{"text":"My flight arrived late so I was looking for a restaurant at 9pm.  Anona is an ok option if you are staying at the Park Hyatt.  The menu is super friendly for weight watcher aficionados since all the better options come in small/large portion sizes.

I had the seafood risotto.  It was good and filling but didn't wow me much.  It comes with generous serving of lobster.  I thought I saw scallops in the menu description but it was no where to be found.

Service was prompt and not intrusive. My glass was always filled and plates taken away."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Annona during summerlicious"}
{"text":"Comfortable surroundings. Great service. Food was very good. Defiantly will be back to try the rest of the menu and for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Love this place

Many memories here as a student

They fed me for a couple of years so I must give them a good review ;-)

Always great food, accommodating, top notch service,  fair price

Saw a few Hollywood Stars here too (bonus)"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hyatt   so had one superb dinner and five very good breakfasts. The setting is quiet, the staff friendly, professional and gracious. Try the lamb chops if you can or fresh halibut- both perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience and the appetizers were very well put together but the main course lacked flavor and the service while polite was horrendously slow (and our waiter was only serving 2 or 3 other small tables). Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm here for winterlicious. It would be my second time here. The food is still a 3 stars in my opinion. The French onion soup is a bit less taste. The wild salmon is quite dry and I didn't think it should go with the beans. There where large sea salt that didn't melt in it. The Chinese waiter was very professional. I think this will tell me the final decision for the next visit if any."}
{"text":"2 stars for food + bonus 0.5 star for high quality service + 0.5 star for pretty plates 
 
Went there for afternoon tea and portions are teeny tiny. Flavour wise isnt AMAZING,  tastes like any other place and they over charge it. 
 
Even though I wouldn't recommend coming back here, it's a nice place to get some afternoon tea pictures. Don't come here for the food though."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here - officially the worst smoked salmon ever. 

While the high price is an obvious result of the location and the brand name, the food is a profound disappointment.

Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Went there for a romantic dinner with my girl. I love the place. Food is amazing, served in a very nice way - looks good & tastes good.
Service is great. Its a really romantic & fancy place. Love their Wine selection also.
Only issue, tables are a bit too close to each other, would love a bit of space for intimacy."}
{"text":"calling to make a reservation is a pain.  They don't answer their phones.  Leaving them a message, they don't call back and making a reservation through open table requires a credit card.  

No thank you. I'm moving on....."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, because we cancelled our reservation. I called to arrange a table for lunch for a few friends and me; I told the Annona person that there would be 4 of us, and that one of us used a scooter and had a service dog. While the restaurant is accessible, she questioned whether the service dog was allowed in the restaurant. Of course, AODA legislation allows service animals in a restaurant. 

I'm sure Annona is a lovely restaurant, but as long as their staff are uneducated about AODA, I cannot spend my money there. Annona Managers: train your staff!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave restaurants in the city.  The service is usually amazing.  The food is really really really good.  On our last visit the crab cakes were amazing!  Juicy and filled with really large chunks of crab.  The portion size was perfect for an appetizer.  I had the seafood risotto.  What a treat!  It's was delicious and filled with large pieces of lobster!
Dessert was maple creme Brule.  Heavenly!"}
{"text":"We went there for Summerlicious. I got crab cake, seafood for main dish and creme caramel. 

The crab cake was amazingly good!! Love it..the sea bass for main dish was very good as well, but needed a bit more broth on that... the dessert is not bad...

The wine in Summerlicious menu is amazing for me as a beginner wine drinker- not bitter at all, very smooth... 

Overall experience is happy!"}
{"text":"After reading Ken S's review, and seeing that there is high tea at this location, I decided to try it out. 

We ended up ordering a la cart, and it was nice! I ordered the Eros tea which was probably the best tea I've ever had, went well with our scones and tea biscuits. 
The little tea biscuits were a little smaller than I thought they would be (If ordering a la cart, they give you 4 of the tea biscuits and 4 of the scones). But all of it tasted really well. Also came with 4 condiments (honey, raspberry jam, strawberry jam, and a mandarin one I believe). 

Because of the great tea, great service and great food, I would definitely like to come back here and try it out for dinner/lunch"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with a girlfriend and loved it.

The service was fantastic from the greeter to the wait staff.  It had a very fancy feel to it.  The food was excellent and my steak cooked perfectly.  The portions were hearty, and I definitely felt full at the end of it.

A great place for a date, or a girl's night."}
{"text":"If you want to splurge for a special occasion, this is the place. Often times we decide to go to a fine dining restaurant for a special occasion, get disappointed by the food or service and still have to shell out the cash. Annona made our night perfect. I specified it was for a birthday for my boyfriend in the reservation and they made special preparations for the dessert without me having to ask. 

On top of the amazing service, the food was ON POINT. We had the crab cakes and French onion soup to start, sea bass and filet mignon for the main, and cheesecake for dessert. Filet mignon was amazing. Actually, every single dish was delicious. Strongly recommend if you want to spoil yourself or anyone else."}
{"text":"Came for afternoon tea ($45, starts at 3pm) and realized I had come here for Winterlicious last year (which was not too pleasant, but afternoon tea was better!) Made a reservation for the restaurant online, with no 'afternoon tea' option, but luckily they were able to accommodate. I enjoyed the ambiance, the teaware and sandwiches.

Tea: Sloane teas. I chose Earl Grey Lavender which was very strong & fragrant. The downside is the tea cools down very quickly; need more frequent hot water refills. 

First Course (Savory): Sandwiches (on a plate) - pretty standard tuna salad, ham; the best was the lobster cone. There was also a tofu & shiitake mushroom. 

Second Course (Sweet): mini 3-tier with 3 types of scones and desserts including macaron, raspberry tart, opera cake, coconut & chocolate chip square. The scones are a good small size, paired with cream & selection of 3 jams + honey. I liked the raspberry tart and by then I was already too full to finish the top tier of desserts. 

Definitely a splurge but overall an enjoyable afternoon tea. 

Tip: If you don't want to do valet parking, there are plenty of green p within walking distance."}
{"text":"During a business trip to Toronto, our Canadian-based clients had suggested that we catch up on some business matters over breakfast at one of their local favorites.  My manager, however, wound up rerouting us to Annona, the restaurant in his hotel...perfectly convenient for his early morning commute down in the elevator, of course!

When I finally managed to arrive across town at that early hour, I found myself in the gorgeous Park Hyatt Hotel with its gracious valet staff and elegantly appointed lobby.  The restaurant was decorated like any other upscale hotel eatery in that it managed to be both fancy, yet under-stated at the same time.  The staff was extremely friendly and efficient, constantly refilling our beverages, checking on our meal satisfaction, and so on.

My egg white omelet was fluffy and perfectly cooked.  The side of fresh berries included plump, ripe blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  The freshly-squeezed orange juice and bold coffee were also enjoyable.

Annona provided the perfect mix of casualness and refinement that was necessary for our business meal.  In the end, I guess that the destination was actually worth the trip and my manager's satisfaction!"}
{"text":"We went to Summerlicious here for my brithday.  They treated us really well and the food was very good.  My hubby and I both had the shrimp appetizer, he had the steak, I had the halibut, and for dessert we had the lemon tart, the molten chocolate and the ice cream.  The meal came with a nice bread baket.  

My fish was wonderful -- such fantastic flavor and cooked perfectly (flaky but moist!) .  My husband loved the steak and he is not normally a sauce fan -- but he really enjoyed this.  We had the special wine pairing on the Summerlicious menu (which was very reasonable btw), and at the end - they brought out a mini-birthday cake with a Happy Birthday sign in chocolate on it.  

Service was great right from the hostess to the servers!
We would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend for Summerlicious. I wasn't impressed by the food at all. The service was lovely, we made reservations and were seated promptly. When I was looking for the bathroom someone immediately asked if I knew where I was going and gave me directions. The ambience was also great, probably what you'd expect at any higher end hotel in Yorkville. The food however reigns king for restaurants and I'm afraid I was disappointed. We started with a salad and the lettuce had darkened/dirty ends. It was really unappetizing. I ordered a medium rare steak and it came out medium well done. The beef was not tender and difficult to chew. Very little taste as well. My boyfriend had the salmon and it was so dry it was crumbling! The only somewhat saving grace were the desserts. The lemon tart was probably my favorite dish between mine and my boyfriend's meals. The sorbet my boyfriend got was delicious and cleansed our palettes very nicely. Overall, I'm giving this place a 3 stars (barely) because the ambience and service were good, it's a treat to be in Yorkville and walk around after - so good location - but I wouldn't recommend this place for the food based on its quality and price. So really when it comes to restaurants I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Where to even begin! After much research on a slightly fancy yet affordable restaurant, I decided to take my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday, and I'm incredibly glad this was the place I had chosen.

The waitstaff were very attentive (constantly on top of water refills) and polite, but the staff member who really stood out was the wonderful woman who greeted us at the dood, Valentina.

She constantly came by to check on us, offer more bread (as we had swiftly devoured the soft bread with feta and olive filling), and was overall very lovely to talk to. 

Initially, she had set up a slightly secluded table near the window (many of the tables here are close together) for some privacy, having read my note about the purpose of the dinner. I hadn't requested this in the note, but what I did have written in the note was followed to a T, and it made our experience the best it could be.

We were so stuffed after our meals that we couldn't even look at the dessert menu, but being that it was my boyfriend's birthday, Valentina brought us a delicious (and adorable) strawberry cheesecake, topped with some of the best whipped cream I've ever tasted..

When we were taking pictures of the cake, a sweet and very polite waitress came by and asked if we'd like our photo taken together, which was kind of her.

Never have I ever had a better restaurant staff experience. This really just took the cake.

As for the food, I absolutely loved mine. I got the smaller portion of the fish of the day healthy balance option ($18). The fish of the day (I believe, I can't quite remember what I was told) was some kind of bass, and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Soft and tender on the inside, and perfectly crispy around the edges.

The sides I chose (you can have one sauce and two sides) were the grilled roma tomatoes and the portebello mushrooms, the sauce being avocado salsa. I loved everything.

My boyfriend got the surf and turf ($41), which he loved as well. I had a bit of the steak from it, which was also cooked perfectly to our tastes and very flavourful. 

Overall (since neither of us drink alcohol and we got tap water), our two items came to a total of $66.67, tip excluded.

Thank you so much to the staff at Annona that night. You gave us an amazing experience to start off an amazing night, and we'll be sure to come back in the future."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in a hotel, this place does a solid job.  I typically don't expect much while traveling and getting that quick bite downstairs but this place aims to please. The service is quite good. The menu has a really nice range of options. I went with the seafood salad which was great and not really a salad. It was a nice surprise. It was more of a nice piece of salmon and a shrimp with super tasty scallops on an israeli salad with potatoes. The cream of mushroom soup as a starter was pretty good, not great. The dessert of a maple creme brûlée was exquisite. I highly recommend it.  They even gave me a few treats to close out the meal I couldn't touch because I was so full from the deliciousness I had already eaten. For a good meal with no hassle, this is your place."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary somewhere nice and decided to go for a lunch instead of dinner. When choosing restaurant we were surprised that Annona did not have any recent reviews on Yelp. Despite this we decided to try Annona since it has a pretty good rating. 
We showed up at the restaurant and were quickly seated by the hostess. After ordering we asked the server for the washrooms. He explained where the washrooms were and I went off to wash my hands before lunch. Now here's the kink, the washrooms turned out to be quite far away from the restaurant. You had to go out and way down the hotel corridor and then climb a flight of stairs. This is fine for us who are younge but I heard some older ladies who were in the washroom complain about needing a chair to rest after the little trek. So this is maybe something the restaurant should think of. Next my husband went off to the washrooms and came back with a big wet stain on his pants. Apparently the soap dispenser had malfunctioned and squirted out soap right on his pants. It looked as if he had a little accident. 
Back at the table we were served a bread plate. This is when I realised that my napkin was missing and it took a little while before I got hold of one of the servers to ask for one. The bread plate was served with warm bread stuffed with some cheese and olive filling as well as crisp bread. However, the stuffing was way way too salty that we immediately had to ask for refill of our water glasses. We just stopped eating the stuffed bread. The crisp bread had been placed next to the warm bread and consequently lost its crispness and became soggy. Big disappointment! 
Our starters arrived and I was disappointed to see that my salad consisted mainly of lettuce (like 99.9% of it) and a total of ONE cocktail tomato (not pickled) the size of a quarter plus one tiny little quail egg. No shaved cheese on top. My though was: that's it? For being a fine restaurant at a high end hotel I expected more. I'm sure they could afford to add on a few more cocktail tomatoes. Besides on the menu it actually says pickled tricolored tomatoes, quail eggs (plural) and shaved manchego cheese - this was obviously false advertising. To top things off, the dressing the salad was served with was bland and lacked acidity so it did not help the disappointing salad. My husband's crabcake was on the contrary surprisingly tasty. 
Next our mains arrived. I had ordered the chicken with risotto and my husband ordered the lamb. The lamb was perfectly cooked and had some parsley caper mix on top. Unfortunately as with other things today this was oversalted. My risotto had some strong cheese and unfortunately it took over the flavour completely that  I couldn't even taste the chicken. The chicken was also very dry which did not improve our impression. 
Next we got our desserts. We went for the mascarpone tart with mango coulis and the creme caramel. The caramel dessert was extremely sweet. The tart was good but I think it would have been more refreshing if the mint had been mixed into the coulis. 
In summary there were many things that went wrong with today's lunch. From malfunctioning soap dispensers to oversalted food. I'm hoping that this was a rare event and that the chef just had a bad day. Nontheless, based on our experience today I will not be recommending friends and family to go to Annona. I wanted to rate the food alone 1 star but the friendly staff and nice service upgraded Annona to 2 stars."}
{"text":"We went here with a couple friends for brunch on a Sunday before driving back to the US.

Fantastic food.  Stellar service.

The gentleman serving us knew the history of ingredients being served to us;  IMPRESSIVE.

Very very reasonably priced for what you got."}
{"text":"Just your average run of the mill hotel restaurant. Not sure why hotels can't get their restaurants running like real businesses. 

Nothing exceptional, nothing to come back for. Just a convenience."}
{"text":"I loves me ma seafoods! And Annona is beyond great for that. I've been here twice, both times for lunch and I really enjoyed the freshness of their seafood and how they always pair it with a nice citrus glaze, sauce or dressing. It just really elevates the dish and makes the meal scrumptious. 

I've had the grilled seafood salad and they serve you MONDO SIZED scallops, shrimp and a piece of fish or two on a lovely potato salad with tomatoes and cucumbers.

Then, today, I came here again and tried their Summerlicious menu, and the quality of the food was high - cauliflower soup was subtle in flavour and had little pieces of pickled garlic and green olives, the trout on mashed potatoes for my main, and their apricot sorbet for dessert. Everything was fabulous EXCEPT, it became very apparent to me the chef had totally massacred the fry of my fish, because it was served 'skin side' down, while the other 8 diners at my table had their fish perfectly pan fried with the skin facing up. Don't get me wrong, the fish tasted great, was cooked well and moist, but if you are serving everyone a perfectly cooked fish, and one person a fish without any of the crispy skin (some would say a required part of the dish) PLUS giving me a piece of fish that looks like it's been chewed by a dog, it just comes across as inconsistent and lazy. Like, don't play me like that Annona. I'm not a total snob and don't deem that a good reason to send food back (that trout being a damn good piece saved the dish from being a total blunder), but I was honestly bummed I didn't get to experience the pan fried fish skin :''''(


Annona also seems to love having flies as part of their décor, cause there have been BOTH fruit flies and house flies just buzzin around my god damned table during my meal. For a restaurant at the Park Hyatt, you'd think they could invest in some pest control, but nope, they are just too busy fucking up the fry on their fish.

Also, CHRIST ON A SALT LICK. I didn't seem to notice at the time, but an hour after the meal, I was hit with this insatiable thirst and have now consumed a bottle and a half of water. So, yea, Annona is sneaky and somehow loads the dish up on sodium to make stuff taste better? *SAD TROMBONE*"}
{"text":"We were at TIFF in September for business and pleasure. While our stay in Toronto, I was invited to have lunch with friend's family at Annona. The restaurant was located at the Park Hyatt in Yorkville. I liked the ambience, and the decor was somewhat a mixture of traditional and contemporary. We had a table by the huge window. It was very nice.

The food was great. We ordered Lobster Sandwich, Steak, Smoked Salmon with dill cream, and fruit salad. The sandwich was a little over toasted but it wasn't ruining the Lobster flavor. The fruit salad was very fresh. I enjoyed the food there. 

The service was great too. We had a very attentive waiter. Our table was kept clean and water and coffee were always filled. It's always nice to have a great meal with great company. I truly enjoyed the time here. I would like to come back here when I visit the town next time."}
{"text":"I think that the food was great, but our service, while kind, was a little erratic! We had to repeat orders or send a few drinks back because they weren't being remembered, and service at the table was sometimes a bit fumbled and awkward. However, the server was kind and the other staff would come in to check and chat and perhaps to help settle the situation a bit. I quite enjoyed the tiny dessert sampler, but think that a single cream puff was a bit of a cop-out for a dessert - the mini lava cake, crepe brûlée, and mango sorbet were excellent, bough."}
{"text":"Awesome food and portions are very generous considering that it's at a place like Hyatt. We were expecting something small (like at canoe) but we had much leftover. Their lobster risotto and endive salad were the best dishes I had at Annona. Their menu seems to change seasonally though so they may not have them anymore. One of my favourite, solid places I enjoy going in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I never understood high tea and completely do not agree with the price tag attached.

Wanting to try it, I was recommended by friends to give this place a try. There's a food component and an experience component and let's just say they both fell really short on the already low expectations I had. 

I can't say how they compare to other high tea places, but I was not the least impressed. Nothing was completely terrible, but there was absolutely nothing that stood out here. With a $36 per person/tea set price tag, I do not see myself coming back nor recommending this place. I will sum the entire experience in one word, mehh."}
{"text":"This restaurant is okay for a hotel restaurant. I was meeting a friend from out of town at the Hyatt so we just met at Annona for lunch. I didn't have high expectations for it since most hotel restaurants are just okay. 

The location is conveniently located in Yorkville, I can't speak to parking because I took a cab but I assume its like any other hotel - expensive but convenient. 

Our waitress was lovely. She was super friendly and helpful and was always there the moment you needed another drink or to top off your water. 

I ordered the salmon and it was fine. It was a little dry and not as rare as I would like but it was not bad. 

The cake I ordered was perfect. It was a rich chocolate cake that was somehow also very light and satisfying. It was so good I wanted another one :) 

Overall, ambience was nice, location was convenient and food was good. I probably wouldn't come here again unless I was meeting another guest at the hotel though as there are many other great restaurants in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for Winterlicious (lunch) and the food was very good! We both had boston clam chowder to start and it was the best chowder I've had so far. It was not heavy like most chowders because there was barely any cream in it, it was more like a puree with veggies and clam chunks. My friend ordered the salmon with vegetables and risotto and I had the steak with a deep friend mac and cheese triangle. Both entrees were very good, but I could've done without the mac and cheese. For dessert I had the red velvet cake and my friend had a mini waffle with caramel ice cream.

This restaurant is fancy but provides a nice comfy atmosphere. I was a bit worried by other reviews because some said service here was awful, especially if you weren't dressed up, but it was entirely the opposite. We came in jeans and still received excellent service. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious during lunch. Service was great and food was excellent. Had the soup, steak and chocolate cake. Nice sized portions. Only down side was the time it took to get the bill. I realize that many in Yorkville don't need to work but I do!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Annona for breakfast but today I went in for dinner, and let me tell you it was the best dinner I've had in a while. 

It's located in the Park Hyatt Hotel- when you walk into the lobby or are getting out of your car go to the right, and it's on your left you can't miss it. 

Besides the service always being top notch the food was out of this world. I over indulged tonight but believe the those extra calories were worth it. They have their spring inspired menu and every plate sounded wonderful. 

Tonight I started off the with smoked salmon, which could have easily been shared between two people. I find smoked salmon to be pretty standard wherever you go in hotels but it's the presentation which gets me. Annona had it right here- it comes with 3 large pieces of salmon, chopped purple onion, capers, and chopped eggs. For the entree I had the Grilled Seafood Mix which came with grilled shrimp, tuna, salmon and lobster ravioli. Everything was great and I've never had grilled tuna before so I was a bit reluctant to taste it but it was wonderful. The serving size of each fish was not overwhelming about 1-1.5oz each. The handmade lobster ravioli... let me tell you it was unbelievable. If I could I'd eat it everyday. I was with some family members and one of them had lobster mashed potatoes, and I don't think there are words that can describe them but really it was amazing. You'll defiantly need to try them. As for dessert we has a tasting menu and again, without fail, the presentation and taste was wonderful. Hands down one of the best dinner's I've had in a while. 

If you haven't been here for dinner yet or are planning a special dinner you should really consider Annona. 

They have also opened up a patio which is great for the days when we have nice weather. I also took a gander at their lunch menu and it is \"no forks necessary,\" which I think is a great concept with the summertime practically here now. 

If you're looking for parking, they do have valet, or if you prefer to park the car yourself there is Green P parking across the street next to the Four Seasons Hotel. You can enter it from Cumberland or from Yorkville. 

Oh and if you have a ROM membership then you can get %10 off your bill when you do dine at Annona. 

They also have a special going on right now where you choose any appetizer or starter, entree, and dessert for $49. Depending on your meal you know it's a great deal. 

I recommend you check out their website to see their menu, hours, and of course to check their phone number so you can call to make reservations. Which by the way you will probably want to do to ensure you get a table- I know it can get quite busy in there for Sunday brunch and dinner time."}
