{"text":"I like this store. Has alot sub shop, hot food bar, salad bar, sushi, and great bakery.
As long as you hit the right times for the hot foods, 12noon-1:30) and 5:00pm to 6:30)
is when its full with many choices. there's also a sitting area to eat. or you can take it home."}
{"text":"Love this giant eagle, it's always clean and I can shop at 1am when I get off work....Love self check out and the fuel perks :)"}
{"text":"Never again... Cashiers who had no idea how to work their machines just carrying on 35 minute conversations w their coworkers instead of helping you"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this Giant Eagle. Every time I come in here the store is always clean and nice looking, anytime I have a question the associates don't hesitate to answer my questions and their knowledgeable about where the products are located. They have a sushi area which is my fave and the lines are never long."}
{"text":"ooooh.  a grocery store.

....um....


it's big.  and you could get lost in it.
but it's also more crowded than the others you've been to.

you do the math.

at least it's not built on a landfill with poisonous gas seeping through the ground like the one off of transportation boulevard."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....I never really know what to say about Giant Eagle. I always come up with good, yelp-worthy phrases while I'm inside, but then I can't remember them or say to myself, \"Do you really need to review Giant Eagle? REALLY?\"

But ok, here goes. (As you can probably tell, I am trying to get to 200 reviews here.) I ALWAYS dread going here. But once I get there, it's not that bad. In fact, on one particular occasion (a dead Monday afternoon), it was actually pleasant. It all depends on who's at the checkout lines. Not the customers, but the employees. Sometimes, the lines go by really fast, and the cashier knows how to fill the bags just right, and they're quickly put in my cart (which she swiftly dragged by her side to help out with this process), and she doesn't ask for my Giant Eagle card twice as if she forgot who I am already. But sometimes....ooh, it's just horrible. And there are so many self-checkout aisles now, and nobody knows quite how to DIY efficiently (myself included). And I have to grab an US Weekly just to keep from screaming, \"FUUUUUCK!\"

I also don't really appreciate (but, sadly, completely understand) how some aisles are \"trap\" aisles--they are twice the length as the others, with no break in the middle like the rest. You are forced to walk the entire length of these aisles, inevitably looking at/picking up crap you really don't need. And wasting your time. 

Deli counter IS in fact hell. The last two times I went there, though, I saw the madness, did my other shopping, and then came back before checking out to a quieter, quicker meat-grab. But I hate backtracking in supermarkets. It makes me feel like I have made an improper decision in the way I decided to navigate the supermarket. 

Plus, now I want Mike's Hard Lemonade like nobody's business. They have an entire ISLAND devoted to different varieties of this shit. Who needs that much hard lemonade?  (Me. I do.)"}
{"text":"This isn't even my normal grocery store. I live in West Park, so there's a Giant Eagle or Marcs on every corner here. But there are three magical things about this Giant Eagle. 1) it's 24 hours, 2) it has a liquor store, 3) it's right off 90. 

If this was a store I went to in the daytime, maybe I would feel differently. But those of us who end up needing to buy catfood at 6am because they are coming home from a friend's house and they forgot to feed the cats the night before and most likely will be murdered immediately if we show up without food, we don't have that luxury.  

My last time here was just last week. My 2002 Sonata had finally bit the bullet that morning, and my darling sister had given me a ride to Ohio City for an event. Afterwards, I was waiting for her getting very drunk at ABC, because I realized that the benefit to my new carless life would be tequila shots at 1am on a Thursday night. Even when I'm maudlin though, I know how to use a situation to my advantage, so when we were finally driving home at 2am, I asked her to take me to Giant Eagle so I wouldn't be without groceries for the weekend (and also so I wouldn't have to walk to a grocery store. Mostly that. )

It was completely deserted, which is the best part about shopping at overnight stores. You can pretend you are all alone, and actually looting the place. For being wasted, I did surprisingly well. The next morning I found myself stocked with banana chips and mini croissants. The thing that sucked the most was that the most important section, the one containing the cat food and the toilet paper, was closed off for floor washing. And I got yelled at for trying to go in there. I didn't cry though, so maybe I didn't try hard enough. Also, why is the pet food always somewhere near the ice cream and the makeup? I assume that's on purpose, because I know if I were designing grocery store layouts, I would do the same thing. 

The only time I ever go there during regular business hours is for the liquor store. If you go on a Friday after 5pm, there is a huge line there, but while you're standing in line waiting, clutching your ten dollar bottle of Paramount vodka, some old guy behind you will serenade you with a current R&B hit about \"laying you down\", so that's charming. The wine and beer selections are all better than the other area groceries stores. 

Most importantly, if you see a rainbow while you're on the highway headed home, it's the perfect place to pull off and get a pretty good view."}
{"text":"This Giant Eagle is crap. My guess is there is a manager at the top who is completely incompetent. Lately they have been re-arranging the aisles and the store is in complete disarray. Why do you have two aisles labeled \"beverages\" and no juice? WHERE IS THE G*DDAM JUICE? Many of the shelves in the beverage aisles are empty. Why is it taking weeks to re-arrange the store? Why doesn't the manager care?

Every time I come here there are huge lines, and one or two, sometimes three check-out clerks. Most of these clerks are the limit of incompetence. They have one speed - super slow. They clearly do not want to be there, and I don't blame them. I don't want to be there either! Giant Eagle must be paying their employees in magic beans, because most of them seem barely employable.

There is one redeeming factor here, at least for me: the donuts. They are pretty good, but not worth the ridiculous hassle presented by the rest of the store.

Well, we knew this would happen when Topps shut down. Without any real competition Giant Eagle has really gone to sh*t. From now on I'm shopping at Heinen's."}
{"text":"Let me begin by telling everyone that I was very excited for this store to open.  The prepared food area, the brie counter as well as the green building that they were all housed in were winners in my book!  When I attended the store opening, I experienced a glorious shopping experience -enjoying solictious help, free food samples and the alleuhia competent staff.  I was so psyched that this brand new grocery store was in my neighborhood!
Fast forward to present day.  The store has declined so rapidly, that I can only surmise that a deadly strain of ghetto fever has swelled and destroyed the brains of management.   My past few experiences as a customer produced within me an emotional stew of anguish and confusion.   The worst ordeal experienced is when I ordered a sandwich from the prepared food area.  There were three young women working the counter with me being the only customer at the time.  Now factor in the off-the-clock male employee wearing street clothes, and his Giant Eagle badge, all the time standing next to me, bantering with the girl who was waiting on me.   When she went around the counter to retrieve the sandwich of my choice, she laughingly decided to kick him in the leg, just barely missing me!  To my astonishment, the manager of this area was witnessing this \"foreplay\" and did nothing to discourage them.  I waited a full 12 minutes for my heated sandwich and pickle, due enirely to the social hour  that was going on behind the counter.  
After picking up other items, now it's time for check-out!  Let's add insult to injury and wait out eternity in purgatory.  I watched one unlucky dupe switching lines in hopes of getiing out of there under an hour. Unfortunately, the poor fellow only prolonged his penance.   Desperate, I threw my lot in with the other disenfrancished and decided to give the self check-out a whirl.  The patheic old couple in front of me were in the midst of a heated hissing discussion as to how to check-out produce.  Also in my line of vision was a sobbing female employee, pacing back and forth in front of the check-out counters.  A very young and stressed Assistant Manager walked past her without even a side glance.   All the while, there was only one employeed on post to respond to all the blinking lights in the endless sea of self check-out areas due to alcohol ring-ups and customer screw ups.
When finally reaching the gates of heaven, and swiping my Giant Eagle card, I realized with extreme distress, that my longed for departure was yet again to be delayed, due to my attempted ring-up of a bottle of wine.  As the flashing light went on overhead, I waited an additional ten minutes before  finally in raw anger, I walked over to the Assistant Manager, demanded his immediate assistance and proceeded to complain bitterly. He told me that a few cahiers had called in sick.  I informed him of the party behind the prepared food section.  Perhaps they could pitch in?  Aren't Giant Eagle employees cross trained to serve any function that needs to be attended to??  
Heinens, here I come!  I'm thrilled to have you as my new grocery store!"}
{"text":"Go crazy it may sound....the sub shop in here is killer...they have caprese salad!
They have a pretty good wine selection and did some construction, it looks like a wine tasting section? Great meat also. State liquor store inside as well. I do hate this parking lot though no one ever knows who has the right of way.

I see a lot of bad reviews on here that the lines are long. Did it ever occur to anyone to maybe pay attention to the time of day you choose to go shopping? Like for example weekends...especially Sundays are a terrible idea. I just think its rude to assume someone is \"incompetent\"  bc a line is long. Your time isn't more valuable than anyone elses."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE:  I like Giant Eagle.  The stores are clean, the prices are reasonable, and the selection is huge.  As mentioned, this particular Giant Eagle contains a Liquor Store.  I'm not a big drinker, but it is very nice to be able to purchase a full liquor supply here if needed.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The deli in this particular Giant Eagle is a hell-hole.  During my last visit to this location, I walked up to the deli counter at 8:34 pm.  The very large woman behind the counter was just standing there, yukking it up with her coworker.  
 
After a little time had passed - you know, so she could laugh more - she finally decided to ask what I needed.  I told her and she then informed me that they would not cut any more meat for the evening; the reason being, they were closing down and cleaning up.

I asked her what time they closed the deli and she said 9:00 pm.  Yes, they still had 26 minutes till they closed, but she was flat-out refusing to cut anything else.  And I'm not paranoid, and very, very rarely call anybody on racism, but there was a definite edge to her refusal of my request.

After paying for my order, I went to the service desk and complained.  The woman behind the counter said, \"Ugh.  Again?  Yeah, people have complained about that a bunch of times before.  I'll get the manager.\"  When the manager showed up, he took my complaint and noted that they are supposed to cut meat all the way until 8:55 pm.  He said he would talk to the woman that treated me rudely at the deli.  I knew he wouldn't.  He was young and tiny and she would eat him alive if he dared utter a word.

In addition to the deli experience, I'd have to say that customer service throughout this Giant Eagle is sorely lacking.  The place also doesn't seem as clean as the other stores in the chain.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  I like shopping at Giant Eagle, but will never return to this location unless I am hankering to be abused by Jabba the Hutt at the deli counter."}
{"text":"I used to spend 250$-300$ a week at this store. That is until today... I will never shop here again. This place constantly is a hassle, one thing or another, but you will have that anywhere. The main thing was the old cranky bitch in checkout lane 14. I don't fucking care that someone knocked over your safety first sign and your mad. Then you want me to set it up for you by barking at me that it's not right. You preceded to have an attitude through the whole checkout and bagging process, even throwing a couple bags at me instead of handing them or setting them down. Then you wanna bitch about how you need a vacation. It's fat old dumb bitches like you that bitch and make your self out to be so epic that fuck things up for a simple day of shopping. Got me into a family argument over throwing my glass bottles in a bag. If it would've broke I would've called your manager then but hopefully they put you on a permanent vacation cause you suck and have ruined my regular store to shop at."}
{"text":"This Giant Eagle is usually my go-to place, but strictly because of location and timing.  I live on Madison near W 117th and could easily drive to the Giant Eagle on Edgecliff or maybe even on Detroit/Bunts, but it's easier to get here and they are 24/7.  

I often need to go here late at night after work, and it looks like a nightmare for the employees.  The place is always busy, and there will be about 4 employees running around helping people who can't understand the self-scan checkout lanes, which also seem to break down for no apparent reason.  Nobody has time for you here, you better know where something is and get to it and check out.

The more often I come here, the more I start to re-consider how convenient it is."}
{"text":"The sanitary wipes dispenser at the entrance is ALWAYS empty. Now knowing that shopping carts are 50-72% covered in e.coli and filth, this germaphobe is not happy at all.

The on-duty cop makes checking out and exiting uncomfortable and awkward. Not sure if it's the same one every time, but they watch you scan and bag with a stalker-stare fury with arms crossed as well as when you're rolling your way out. I've tried flat out ignoring and playing with my phone, nodding and smiling, and just saying hi as I passed by. Nothing diminishes the discomfort. I know it must really suck to have \"Giant Eagle duty\", dude, but maybe you could just hang out behind the two-sided mirror door. At the very least, have some donuts on-hand. They got em in the back.

They have a decent liquor store."}
{"text":"Oh Giant Eagle, how I love you but hate you all at the same time. This is my favorite bird out of all of them in my Lakewood area. It's a lot bigger, more of a selection. You can get hot foods, they have a liquor store, a very big cheese section, and great bakery. 
I love their deals on can cat food. I got 45 cans for $20!!! Love that! They always send me coupons on the things I buy based on my Giant Eagle card. The fuel perks rule everything around me. Especially with double fuel perks on gift cards purchases of $50 or more. They do that deal from time to time.
Digging that it 24hrs. Helps with my busy schedule.
People say it's expensive, that's because they don't know how to shop. I buy things on sale and I buy their brand a lot. It's the same as top name brands. 

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the service is blah. During busy periods they won't have a lot of lines opened. They only have one person working the self check out lines but they are never there when you need them. They also need baggers for the self checkout line (it would make the lines go faster) I literally had 60 items today (45 being cat food) and watched 3 workers stand I front of my line and didn't help bag. They were just talking and laughing. Lame. 
Half the time...maybe I would say most of the time the employees aren't smiling. Get a new job if you hate it. 

Check the ads before you shop. You can find killer deals :)"}
{"text":"This is a very large store drawing customers from the diverse socioeconomic groups who live in the region.  Other than size, nothing is particularly extraordinary about GE on West 117th Street.   The international aisle falls short of breaking monotony with too much shelf space given to run of the mill Italian American pastas and tomato products.  Cleveland's considerable Eastern European population is snubbed completely. No bottles of morello cherries are in the international aisle and no fresh dill can be found in produce. 

There are few above average departments in the store. The submarine bar unexpectedly offers reasonably priced sandwiches that exceed any from the area sub shops I have had the misfortune to visit thus far. The hot foods and salad bar are very expensive. But I find the salad bar is quite convenient if I use it just to buy the toppings for ramen or to select cooking ingredients, e.g. sliced mushrooms, green peppers, onions. I infrequently purchase freshly brought out meats at the hot bar but never the vegetables at those prices.

The bakery has some excellent bread. Some are not that excellent so it is hit or miss. The deli in front of the store is filled with overpriced but higher quality prepared foods not found in most grocery stores. The deli in the back of the store has the standard preserved-processed-water-added-salty products. Meats and fish are premium priced for average quality. I rarely drink anything alcoholic but there seems to be a wide selection of beer and wine plus a separate state liquor agency. 

I expect we are the lone major market served by only one large grocery chain. Until another large chain enters Cleveland, GE will enjoy non competitive pricing.

I shop here for proximity to my house. I can get everything I need as long as my needs are national brands. I really enjoy most of the workers I have been fortunate enough to get to know. I find this store is the appropriate place to be a good Samaritan. Often I help someone who has trouble at the self check aisle. I offer to scan while she bags. As a rule older persons walking painfully slow are at that pace for just that reason. They are in pain but forced to do their own shopping. To them I offer to get something from another aisle. Or I help someone who may be disabled by taking his cart back for him. This store is not in outer suburbia where everyone is healthy, 25-45 years old, white, straight, middle class and demanding. So far despite my many happy years on this earth I remain fairly able and was taught to offer a helping hand."}
{"text":"Is it THAT hard to have more than one person working the self-checkout stations during busy times? And WHY GOD WHY do they have a button on the register for you to \"Use your own bag\"--but then require you to stand, wait and get approval once you push it? 

I came in yesterday trying to use my own bag, selected the button on the self-checkout register and it took over 5 minutes for someone to come over and swipe their badge. Meanwhile a line of impatient people were waiting behind me. Having more than one employee in this situation would help a lot. 

Also, the seafood is just not good. When I have the option to go to Heinen's, it's worth the drive to Rocky River so that I'm not wasting my money on sub-par quality fish. They have started carrying locally-grown produce, which is nice, but really... I mean, we live in Ohio. It's a farm state. During the growth seasons I don't see how it's necessary to go outside of Ohio for produce. Whatever. 

Service is awful. I asked the lady at the cheese counter to \"snow\" a block of parmesan cheese for me and it was like I slapped her in the face or something. Ummm, I'm sorry for being a customer?! 

Blerg. This place ruins my mood on a daily basis."}
{"text":"i live by this giant eagle and i am forced to come here on a regular basis when looking for things i cant get at a farmers market or over at the west side market. 

every time i come in here there is some debilitated fat person struggling to get into the store or some big fat lady on a scooter. between the sketchy drug addled and the generally shady schemers of the w 117th drag, walking around this store is always stressful. something about the way the store is constantly thrashed is really off putting. the downtrodden, defeated staff doesnt make matters any better. when i was there thanksgiving morning picking up a few odds and ends for dinner, some party animal was being taken outside on a stretcher (presumably too intoxicated to get out of the bathroom, and definitely wasnt shopping.)

they never have fresh cilantro when i need it either!! 

aside from location and its 24 hour schedule, this place is plain scary.

need to try and go to natures bin more often."}
{"text":"This is a very mixed bag. The service the past few visits was slow and not so great. I think there's a lot of turnover in cashiers to explain that issue. They have a good selection though and wide aisles. And cmon: who doesn't love fuel perks?!"}
{"text":"This giant eagle is KING ! 
If you could describe a grocery store as user friendly, this is the one. It's very well organized, with a beast layout. I drive extra to shopping at this Giant Eagle over the Steelyard Walmart. I have never waited in line to check out with a cashier, but I also avoid going on weekends so this may not always hold true. The staff is very friendly. The costumers are less than pleasant, pretty rude to say the least, but not enough to keep me away from my groceries !"}
{"text":"Ahh yes, the good ole grocery store. This Giant Eagle usually has what I need, but I also usually don't stop at this location unless I have to.

This Giant Eagle has messier parking (they share a parking lot with Target). The store is fairly organized but I don't always find them having the freshest produce. In most cases a grocery store is just a grocery store, but I'm always on the hunt for good produce and it's something I always notice right away.

Otherwise, the staff is nice and they have a good selection of local brands in-stock. If you can get over the craziness of the immediate area, it's fine if you need to make a quick stop in."}
{"text":"Blah, blah, blah, it's a Giant Eagle, and there are already approximately three million Giant Eagles in the Cleveland metropolitan area. But this one is slightly different: it has a liquor store inside of it. 

That's right, hidden behind the 10-foot-tall stacks of Full Moon Winter Ale, there's a little store-within-a-store hidden to serve all of your full-alcohol needs. 

Apparently Giant Eagle has been paying attention to folks like myself, who until now have had to go separate places for 1) Hungry-Man meals, and 2) gin. Oh, wait, they have Lean Pockets here! Great, now I can eat healthy."}
{"text":"Just inside of this 24/hr. haven, one is struck by the presence of local produce: non-GMO onions and zucchini heaped on a table for 99 cents/lb. Farther along, a dearth of organic veggies--the wilted kale and other greens comprising maybe a tenth of the looming northward wall--but the local produce is a wonderful gesture that sticks with the shopper as they traverse the mighty expanse. Expectedly, there are innumerable aisles jammed with a thousand varieties of dish soap, snack cracks, mayonnaise, etc. Many things are typically on sale. Craft beer enthusiasts rejoice: the alcohol section is surprisingly well-curated. At the store's rear, a meat counter promises treats from the entire barnyard: fileted and faceless on gleaming display. Cheerful employees are always back here, sampling IPAs and burgers in summer. There is also a wine expert, hidden among the rows. Sometimes, he too is offering samples for an affordable quarter a cup. Another welcome gesture. There is a mammoth case of frozen vegetarian foodstuffs around the corner, though a head-scratching lack of Field Roast sausages in the dairy case. On weekends,  the same squad of familiar cashiers populates the checkout line, so there isn't usually a need to fight with the hideous automated self-check outs that constantly freeze and bark and sometimes tweak out completely, requiring an actual human to be summoned anyway. It is these personal touches which elevate this old bird beyond the competition. Be sure to get a store card in order to rack up the fuel perks: soon enough you'll be buying gas for less than a buck a gallon at the service station conveniently located right at the front of the lot."}
{"text":"The selection of food at this Giant Eagle is fantastic. You can always find everything you need. However, I am not a big fan of the layout. I usually have trouble finding things because the aisles are not continuous. You can not cut throught the middle like stores I am used to.

I have found that Giant Eagle can be a little over priced. I actually do some of my shopping at Target because I can save a decent amount of money by doing so. 

I do appreciate how this Giant Eagle is a one stop shop: grocery, pharmacy, liquor store, and prepared food. There is also a little cafe area that you can eat any prepared food you buy. 

The lines can be very long at the busy points of the day, but I have found the lines move pretty quickly. Sometimes I wish that had more people working the checkout lines vs the self checkout. Self checkout can be great, but it usually backs up at the busy times."}
{"text":"the most un-consumer friendly store on the planet.  have time to waste waiting around, come here!  have time to wander aimlessly looking gor things that were moved the night before, come here!  by far my least favorite store and chain."}
{"text":"This review is for their bakery only since I do not do my regular shopping here (why pay higher prices when you can go to Aldi's with very similar quality food for cheaper).  Their cakes are delicious and affordable.  They also had a pretty large selection of cake designs compared to other Giant Eagle locations.  The woman I spoke with to confirm my last cake order was very nice and helpful.  I would definitely buy Giant Eagle cakes again - they totally rival traditional bakeries in the area that cost much more."}
{"text":"I really dislike going here, but what other option do I have?  Aldi?   I thinks not.  :-/

Always long lines....too many self check outs...not enough actual cashiers.  ugggggg

Anyway....have fun and plenty of time. 

Prices are way too high....I wish Publix was in Ohio....oh how I miss thee.  :-)"}
{"text":"Simply put this is an easy to get to grocery store that supplies your basic needs in food. In many ways this is comparable to a Meijer's without the clothing options. If you have never been to Giant Eagle make sure to stop by the customer service located at the front. Because at checkout you will be directed to scan your rewards card. The benefit of using the rewards card is that you get so much money off at the gas station in front of giant eagle."}
{"text":"Never have enough check out lines open. Big variety of food but extremely overpriced. Parking is a mess because there's also a target in the shopping plaza."}
{"text":"This review/rating is for Giant Eagle Subs-a separate sub shop within giant eagle. The subs are amazing. The bread is much fresher then Subway, and they pile on the meats (and they actually weigh them on a scale).  These subs come in a seven and fourteen inch option. I always get footlongs@ subway but you don't need more then a seven inch here, they are that filling and delicious.

Lastly the sides are also very tasty. The coleslaw and potato salad are made in house and are very fresh. The drink station is also unbelievable. Any type of beverage you can think of is available. Many flavors of coffee, Icees, great selection of soda with unlimited refills. 

I did not have great expectations for this because it's a grocery store not a sub shop. But now I actually find myself going here solely for the subs.  They should have come up with this idea a while ago. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I just received a very courteous call from the manager about the situation. The manager profusely apologized for the issue and the conduct and is working to address the situation - e.g. someone should have cleaned the facilities. It's always great to have a callback or some feedback!"}
