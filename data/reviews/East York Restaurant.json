{"text":"Too bad you can't give a no star review. Take all the local alcoholics and gather them up in one place, well this place is it. It's loud, obnoxious and an eye sore for the community. I ordered a simple hamburger and fries here and I actually returned it because the fries were soggy and the burger smelled funny. It's best you walk on the other side of the street when you come near this place because of all the smokers blocking the sidewalk."}
{"text":"I often get breakfast here - always delicious and reliable.  Their East York Special - three eggs, bacon/sausage, home fries and toast - is filling and inexpensive. The main waitress/bartender is always friendly and personable, and the regulars are also polite and friendly. There is a kind of family atmosphere between the people who frequent this place.

I really have no idea what's going on with the other reviewers here. Their main points of criticism seem founded on pure conjecture and rumour. In the three years I've been coming to this restaurant, not once have I or my girlfriend ever felt in danger or threatened. Yes, it is a humble place - the menu is not going to be like a gentrified, overpriced \"ironic\" diner.  I can understand some people not liking the smokers out front, but I have never experienced anything like rudeness from anyone there. Now, I've never gone at night for a beer, but it is a neighbourhood watering hole; every place needs one of those.

If you want a fancy looking place with overpriced food, surrounded by snobs, there are plenty of other places down by the Danforth. If you want simple, cheap and satisfying food, and you can handle the fact that you're surrounded by people who aren't all yuppies and hipsters, give this old place a try."}
{"text":"In the morning, this is a friendly breakfast place frequented by the local seniors. Starting at 11AM, the local daily drinking crowd starts to filter in from the older high-rises in the area. Many are on social assistance or pensions and thus show up almost daily. They can be a little rough around the edges but it's generally trouble-free until after dark. However, some evenings, it can get quite rough. Fights do occur regularly. I just went by and saw some clearly identified members of a biker gang out front. I won't name the gang. Fine for breakfast. NOT recommended after dark. Crossing the street is good advice."}
