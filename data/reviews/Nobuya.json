{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! A small family owned business on Royal York, unfortunately not alot of people know about  this place.    First thing when you come in, the owner greets you with a smile on his face and seats you. The menu is small but demonstrates the chef's expertise.   We had a party of 4 and we each ordered different things. The owner and chef Nobu, makes all the dishes as soon  as you order. He will come by with a smile on his face and presents you his creation. He gives you a brief description of what is in his dish. As a Japanese person you can see he takes his job seriously and pride in his cooking. The authenticity definitely shows from how the food is presented and how it tastes.   We ordered the Japanese poutine, udon with seaweed, soba noodles with karaage, pork katsu done and I got the ramen. Everything was  great, right amount of flavor and had that authentic Japanese taste. The ramen's soup was a tad salty to my liking but the seaweed, pork, bamboo shoots and elasticity of noodles gave it an authentic Japanese taste.  Owner was super friendly he would chat us up and made sure the food was OK. When he left he gave us a bar of hi chew candy.   It was a great experience. If you're a fan of fast food or Japanese food do yourself a favor and give this place a try. Your wallet and stomach will thank you.  TL;DR. Small place, friendly service. Great food for a good price. 5/5 must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic. Their Ramen is well balanced and not salty like other Ramen Shops in the GTA. The Takoyaki is the best in the city and the service is what makes this place memorable! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had just arrived in Toronto following a tiring flight and all I wanted was ramen. Nobuya had the best spicy miso ramen and it satisfied my craving. Would definitely recommend this place.  The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait a long time for what is supposed to be Japanese \"fast food\".The owner needs to take a course on customer service and anger management.  Given my experience, I have no doubt that many of the positive reviews on here are FAKE or manipulated as one reviewer mentioned.  The owner is a nutcase.  I'll tell you why...     Me and my wife were sat down at 7pm and provided menus.  Keep in mind that everyone is in plain sight and 25 mins later our order still wasn't taken.  Any attempt to have our order taken was in vain as he literally never once looked our way!  It was like we didn't exist and there was only one other table of 3 occupied in this small restaurant at the time.     No big deal, we were both hungry and given the options for ramen out there and the fact that the owner had not taken our order or didn't seem to care we decided to leave.       Walked into my vehicle and was in the middle of a conversation about where to go when we see the owner approaching our vehicle! This was amusing to me for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, he was the only person in the restaurant and he left his other customers in his restaurant alone.  Secondly, he looked like he wanted to fight!  As this experience was in cookoo 'case study' territory, I will try to describe it as accurately as possible.      The man approaches my car and knocks on my window.  I open it.     Him:  \"why?\"  Me: \"what are you talking about?\"  Him: \"why?\" Me: \"why what?\" Him: \"why you go?\" Me: \"because you took too long to take our order and my wife is hungry.\"  Him: \"I am only one person\" Me: \"I don't care, that's not my fault\"  Him: \" f__k you then!\"  Me: \"f__k you too!\"  He then walks in front of my vehicle and yells at me:   Him:\"I call the police\"  Me: \"for what?\" Him: \"I call the police\" Me: \"for what?\" (I was visibly amused at this point) Him: \"......\"  When he stood in front of my vehicle I honestly thought he was going to kick my vehicle as he looked really pissed off.  Last thing I was expecting was him to threaten to call the police lol.    Perhaps he was afraid of how I responded to his profanity? Perhaps it was because I wasn't intimidated by him? I guess I will never know, I really don't understand why he would say that.    I told him to get out of the way.  No response.  When I asked him the 2nd time he responded with another \"f__k you\" followed by a 5 secs stare before he finally moved out of the way.  As I was driving away I could see him in my rear view, the guy was looking at my car on the sidewalk as I was driving away like in those romantic movies! I'm not kidding here.  I could feel his eyes sending laser beam death stares that sent chills down my spine.    Ok, in all seriousness, our mindset after this experience was, \"what the heck just happened?\". I can understand him being upset if we ordered food and left.  It wouldn't justify his actions but I could understand.  What I don't understand is that he never took our order and acknowledged us after we were seated and when we decided to take our money elsewhere he got upset.  Add the fact that he tried to intimidate me and my wife and ended up feeling intimidated himself we have a definite WTF moment.   Take my review for what its worth but it is the truth.  The owner has a few loose bolts.  Very amusing experience."}
{"text":"The food was not good at all. The price is too expensive and the wait staff were rude. I would not go here again and I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great ramen in the west end! Rivals all the other Japanese noodle places in the GTA. This is the real McCoy. The place even has their own parking lot!! A little bit off the beaten track but that makes it all a better find!  Gyoza is fantastic--not deep fried but pan fried and steamed, just enough filling to make them delicate and tasty, like they should be.   Extensive menu includes all the popular tasty dishes like karaage (deep fried chicken), okonomiyaki (egg and cabbage concoction with tasty Japanese mayo and special sauce), as well as the famous Ramune soft drinks.   Go for the ramen but add a few sides. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"First off, I don't know much about Japanese food. So it's authenticity is not something I can vouch for. But, I know that I want this place to be my new local.   We were on our way to the train station, feeling hungry and had a bit of time, so we tried this place out. The food was simple, satisfying and the service was so friendly that you wanted to hang around just to chat.   This is the kind of place that doesn't look like much from the outside, but you go to every Thursday to fill up on delicious dumplings after practice."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I ever had, and I had many even in Japan. Everything else was also yummy. The owners are super friendly. My wife and I had a blast. If we lived in Toronto we would definitely become usuals."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem.  I got the karage chicken, haddock, and Japanese poutine.  It was very good. The Japanese poutine had spicy mayo and dashi flakes in it.  It was amazing.  There is only one chef and he was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  He makes everything by hand, even the tartar sauce for the fish and chips.  I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends.  The price for the quality of the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood. A unique taste of Japanese fast food. I've had the fried fish, fried chicken and poutine and they were all flavorful and delicious. Every dish has a signature taste that's unlike anything I've had before. The guy who owns the place is super nice too. Definitely worth trying out. I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food great service great authentic Japanese restaurant!!  This is a hidden gem in Etobicoke. A two minute walk from Mimico station.  Don't pass up this chance to eat delicious food in a warm and friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were expecting typical fast food with a Japanese twist. What we got was top quality Japanese food. We went with the Japanese poutine as well as a number of more Japanese style dishes. The flavours were amazing and nothing is greasy as you'd expect.   The fries are hand-cut daily and the Japanese poutine focuses on taste rather than layers of cheese/gravy so is almost guilt-free. Can't remember the names of the dishes but we got chicken balls, a dish that was a Japanese twist on rosti, a pork rice bowl (donburi) and free spring rolls for it being our first time. Everything was top quality, taste and presentation.   This is a one-man shop (very friendly!) so I can imagine if it's busy it might take a while for the food, for us was 10 to 15 mins. You wouldn't wait that long for fast food normally, but when you see what you get it is worth the wait.   Looking forward to going back to try the Fish & Chips as the fries were excellent (thick-cut) and the Ramen looks really good too."}
{"text":"One man take care of entire store. A little bit slow but the food is great. Japanese style. Chef prepared the food really carefully."}
{"text":"Amazing food at extremely reasonable prices. My husband I enjoy finding hidden gems and this is by far one of the best we have found. One chef literally runs the entire restaurant and he has just the best attitude, super friendly and great food. We will definitely be back and often!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Came in 30 minutes prior to closing and he was very welcoming.  I had the spicy miso ramen which was very flavorful and filling."}
{"text":"I need to be unbiased. The owner of Nabuya is super friendly. Udon broth is also yummy, but if next time he would provide us with some appetizer and set aside a dish for fried veggies and tempura, then I believe more people would rate 5 stars ;-) Now I would give him 4 stars."}
{"text":"good service and good food randomly located in Royal York Rd!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Had the fish and chips. Not greasy at all and home made french fries."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious first meal here tonight after searching Yelp for a place near us we haven't tried before. True to all the reviews, Nobu did not disappoint. We had a chicken udon, Japanese poutine and pork katsu don. The udon was delicious- no MSG and not over flavored. Just the right amount of salty and sweet. The pork katsu don was also excellent- the egg!! So perfectly done. It was busy tonight in the restaurant so there was a bit of a wait, but the pride Nobu had in crafting each dish was evident in his presentation and taste. He doesn't cut corners and it shows in the first bite. Worth the wait and definitely will return."}
{"text":"Nice place. The food are awesome! Must try! The boos is a Friendly Japanese guy! Enjoy with him."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend because I was craving some ramen and was in Etobicoke with friends. It is a fairly small place, a few tables along the side and a L-shapped table that has a few high chairs. After reading the reviews of this place, about the wait time, I told my friends not to come here hungry. All the reviews here are pretty accurate, this is a one-man-show. This guy not only cooks and prepares your meal, he also takes your order, serves your food, and cleans the place. You can tell he is VERY passionate and enthusiastic about what he does.   We came here at 6:30 pm, we put in our orders in at around 7:00pm. I will note that we were the second group to put our order in. We ordered the fried squid balls (Takoyaki) and ramen, donburi chicken and 2 orders of the udon noodles. It wasn't until maybe 8:30pm we got the takoyaki. They were pipping hot and very flavourful. By 9:00pm another group that had placed an order after us was getting impatient and complained to the owner. The owner actually told them to either wait or get out. By 9:30 pm we finally got our meals. I am not sure if it was because I was hungry, but I inhaled my food. It was super delicious. I ordered the ramen, you could tell that he made the broth from scratch and every piece of meat was carefully cut, breaded, and fried. The noodles were a perfect al-dente, had a nice chew to them. The owner stopped by and made sure we were happy with our food. While the wait was long we didn't mind since we were chatting. We all agreed that the food was amazing and is a hidden gem in Mimico. At the end when we went to go pay for our food, the owner apologized and offered some Japanese snacks on the house, and the next time we come here we would get a free appetizer.   My recommendation is don't come here hungry, but you will leave here full and happy."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place for the ramen, especially in the area. Unless you want to drive to downtown or HWY 7/bayview area it's probably the best. I ordered a ramen, got a good size bowl with a tasty thick broth."}
{"text":"Nobu makes some seriously tasty Japanese street-style eats!  The Shoyu Ramen and the Okonomiyaki  were some of the best I've had!  So glad this is in my neighbourhood!  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Nobu's Jap-style fast food joint has become the new spot for my family and I. We came in on a whim a couple months back and now we're weekly visitors!   A must order every time are the Tempura fries are crisp and delish. Try the Japanese poutine with cheese, spicy mayo, green onion and nori if you want something new. Karrage and dumplings are great for sharing.   Like past reviewers, fish and chips are awesome. I usually only order halibut at other places but the haddock here is really good! Don't for get coleslaw. Yum  UPDATE: Just had the ramen and was so happy to eat it. The noodles are straight up Japanese with a silky broth and the tastiest pieces of pork. Ooooooh buddy!"}
{"text":"I had been considering a visit to this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp. I had a craving for some ramen the other night, so I called ahead and made my way down.   There is parking behind the restaurant, but I missed it the first time around the block.   I was the only patron at the restaurant at around 9:30pm on a Thursday night. I was greeted with a very friendly welcome from the chef/owner. He made some recommendations on what to try. I went with the takoyaki and the tonkustu ramen. Both were full of flavour and super delicious.   While the food was very good and worth the trip, the chef is one-of-a-kind and the biggest reason I will return soon for another tasty bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"To start, this review won't factor in wait time. Unlike a recent previous reviewer (who clearly must have read about the wait time before deciding to eat here) I won't base my rating on what I already knew to be an issue. The star rating here is based solely on the food.   We popped in last night on the recommendation of friends, with the wait time caveat in mind. Only a couple tables with customers but some locals have clearly worked around the wait time by calling in and then picking up orders to go. One table actually left after 15 minutes, complaining about the wait time and being late for a kids practice or something.  We ordered tea and takoyaki up front, then grabbed a table. After about 15 minutes we mentioned we would also be ordering ramen and soba.  We spent quite a while chatting about how we would suggest ways to improve service times, and after about 25 minutes we got our tea. $2.50 for hot water in a dirty mug with a tea bag is a bit much.  The takoyaki arrived about 10 minutes later. Beautiful presentation, and once the heat subsided, they were very tasty little morsels.  Unfortunately we sat beside a large fridge/freezer which the owner/chef/server kept accessing to grab bags of pre-portioned noodles and other goodies. The unfortunate part was spying all the grocery store frozen appetizer selections within.  After another 20 minutes, our mains arrived. The broth in the ramen was outstanding, best I've ever had. But the thick fatty piece of pork was ice cold, the fat unrendered and difficult to eat. The noodles were overcooked and mushy.  My partner's soba was delicious. Fantastic buckwheat noodles and incredible broth. The tempura was tasty but placing it all directly in the broth resulted in soggy, floating pieces of batter.  As we were finishing our soups, the owner brought a small plate with two complimentary spring rolls with some sauces decoratively laced across. Beware these spring rolls. They are nasty, grease-soaked, store bought, freezer burned and vile. These aren't included in the 4-star rating, as we didn't order them, nor are they on the menu (I hope!). We scrunched them up into our napkins and headed to the front counter to pay.  A lot of potential here, but the super friendly and energetic owner needs some help. We really hope he finds it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived just after 9pm and it was pretty busy. Most of the tables were seated at, even the counter are was full. Nobu was busy in the kitchen but seated us immediately. Yes, the food takes a LONG time to arrive at your table, but it was DELICIOUS! We ordered 2 donburis (chicken katsu and fish katsu) and they tasted just as if I was back in Japan! My family is from there and I lived there for over 4 years so it is as close as you can get to authentic Japanese food here in Toronto. Menu is limited but since Nobu is running the entire restaurant, it's really worth trying out. Avoid rush hour dinner times and be prepared to wait at least 30min for your food. Support Nobu as he tries to make this restaurant work.  Oh, if you are looking for a job in a friendly environment and want to learn how to cook authentic Japanese food, tell Nobu! He is hiring!"}
{"text":"Definitly a must go spot for Japanese food. Great service and hands down some delishous food. Saw the menu and was very impressed by the selection and items you probably won't find at other japanese eat spots . I am definitly coming back to eat again . I live around an hr away from this spot and I'm impressed and definitly coming back to try some more dishes this resaurant has to offer . Hands down 10/10  Japanese korokke = life"}
{"text":"I have been to Nobuya twice with my husband and both times the food was nothing short of exceptional. Definitely one of the top Japanese restaurants in the city. Yes, there is a bit of wait for your food since it's a one man show but it's more than worth it. We especially enjoyed the octopus balls, ramen, and seafood pancake with yakisoba noodles. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"More people should know about this little Japanese place! It serves delicious, authentic, Japanese food that's so very unlike the ones you find in those big AYCE places it's refreshing. Plus, their ramen is awesome. Can't tell you how happy these west-enders are to not have to go all the way downtown anymore when the ramen craving hits.  The ambience is nothing to write home about. But it does make you feel like you're in one of those secret eateries in Tokyo that only Anthony Bourdain knows about. For real.   They are all Japanese here so communication is a little challenging but service is sincere and warm.   Food. Ahhhh the food was GOOD! We had the Japanese style poutine, tempura soba and ramen (total bill $40 with tip and a pop so not bad at all). There were other really interesting things on their, albeit limited, menu like octopus balls so we are definitely heading back. I am still dreaming about that ramen though. And I expect with the weather getting cooler, we'll be back lots of times.  And could it really be 5 stars you ask? Free ample parking at the back! There. 5 stars. Let's support the little neighbourhood gems."}
{"text":"Found this place by fluke on a rainy day. The place is pretty small but the ramen was authentic and delicious! Too bad the restaurant is in a bad location. The shop is owned by the sweetest Japanese family who gave us complimentary homemade spring rolls (with takoyaki sauce) and green tea packets to take home lol. Giving this 5 stars for the food and service in hopes that more people read this and support great little family owned businesses that serve authentic cuisine. They also have free parking, a small outdoor patio and very clean bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"We shared an entree of takoyaki, fried chicken, chicken donburi and  Udon.  Everything was very tasty and well made.  Check it out if you're going to a movie at Queensway."}
{"text":"We just found this resto. Live in the neighborhood and were happily surprised to discover Nobuya. We ordered the okonomiyaki, takoyaki and the ramen. All very delicious and excellent value compared to other Japanese restaurants in the city! Owner makes the experience extra enjoyable as he is extremely friendly and courteous. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very small Japanese shop with amazing customer service and great food! It's nice being able to get a good Japanese meal on the west end. You got to try the Japanese style poutine. so good!"}
{"text":"This is my first time reviewing a restaurant, and this is worth it to me because I have never experienced a service like this before, where I feel so welcomed, and having a smile on my face while eating! As mentioned from the other reviewers, this is indeed an authentic Japanese restaurant (The owner was previously from Tokyo), Japanese Fast Food-Ya! has their own charm to their place, the owner and the staff who work there are SO nice, customer service is high up there no doubt about it, because the owner actually takes his time and talks to his customers.   Just like the other reviewers mentioned, the owner is very nice, and he always greets everyone with a smile, you can see this guy is passionate about his business and making sure his customers enjoy their stay at his restaurant. The food, wow it is delicious, takyoyaki balls are fantastic, the temperature is kept so well in the balls, when you take a bite of it, it feels so fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside, it is so well balanced. The ramen was fantastic, the broth is well made, and I seriously had a food coma after this, really enjoyed their food. They also added a poutine of their own, with a Japanese touch to it.This is a HIDDEN GEM, and I hope everyone else will discover this place, it is so worth dropping by to enjoy an affordable, yet delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to this tiny japanese joint south of the QEW. Really loved the japanese pancake and the octopus balls. I would ordered it again for sure. I'm not a ramen addict like some as I usually find it too salty but other customers seemed very pleased with theirs. As other reviewers have mentioned Nobu cooks everything himself and he's very friendly and courteous!"}
{"text":"How do you rate a place that has EXCELLENT food but extremely slow service?   The total time in and out the door for my partner and I was two hours. There's only one man taking orders and cooking.   I literally watched a table of five get their meals at separate times...to the point that the first person who got their food already finished her meal and just sat there as the rest of her dining companions received their meals and ate.  But, back to my partner and I.  Two hours for two appetizers and two meals.   Let's get to the food, shall we?  We ordered the takoyaki and karaage - SO delicious. The takoyaki was the perfect amount of salty satisfaction. The karaage was so tasty with a perfect drizzle of spicy sauce on top. Both served piping hot and fresh.  Onto our main meal, we both ordered the ramen. This was incredibly delicious. It was flavourful with just the right umami. It wasn't salty at all, which is typical of a few ramen joints in the downtown core. It was also served at the perfect temperature. Mere words can't describe how good this was. You have to go there and try it!  The owner apologized for the slow service. He's such a nice guy and we really want his business to do well.   As my partner and i drove home, our conversation consisted of finding a solution to speed up the service. But my partner and I couldn't come up with any viable solutions.  So, fellow Yelpers, help us, help the owner find a solution to speed up service without affecting food quality. He deserves all of the success his delicious food can bring!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. This was my second try to eat at this joint. During my first visit he asked me to leave because I didn't order enough menu items. I was there just to taste Japanese cuisine . I understood it was a weekend then but I went again on a weekday. There was just one table occupied. He insisted us to order more. He is too rude and is there  just thinking about money not giving damn about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"So I decided to ride my bike to Mimico and just happened to stumble on it. Came in today and am just loving the vibe.  The owner's a nice guy who's weekend spot is starting to blow up.  So straight up - he's busy, he tells you he's busy, but he knows he won't disappoint if he makes you wait. So karaage and to takoyaki is on the menu. I've got melon and OG ramune for my wait. And after eating a Hi-Chew I came to find out each piece is 210 calories. Basically this is a total hedge on 3x times the calories I would burn on this bike ride.  Owner is super friendly and straight up nice.   I'm very hopeful this turns out well. It gives me a good excuse for cardio. .... Made it home.  In my belly. Will go back. A lot."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you eat at a new place and you say \"this could be a new spot\" that's how I feel about Japanese fast food-YA. I've been here twice now and wasn't disappointed. I've had the chicken karaage, fish and chips, the gyoza dumplings and the wonderful Japanese poutine. I seriously love the fries here. Everything is made to order and fresh. The owner is also absolutely wonderful. This is definitely a new spot for me"}
{"text":"The food are amazing especially the karage chicken and ramen! Quick fast food and really friendly!"}
{"text":"Japanese fast food ya!! I've lived in area for over a year now and finally scoped this place out. Had haddock fish and chips, karrage and dumplings. Everything was great, especially the fish. Tender and beautifully battered. Not too salty... same for dumplings and chicken. Will be back to try the Ramen. Expect to wait!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Rated 4.5 stars. Restaurant itself doesn't appear very attractive on the outside, but its food is pretty authentic. I like the okonomiyaki. Really delicious.Definitely recommended although it can be a little less salty. Shoyu ramen tho, way too garlicky. The garlic overwhelms other flavours of the soup and it's not very pleasant to drink. Overall I think this restaurant is a bit overrated. But if you wanna have a taste of some legit Japanese fast food, you can go and have a try. The owner of the restaurant is super nice tho. Very hardworking Japanese guy with true passion to the business.  Food: 3.5/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Etobicoke. The food was so fresh and flavorful. It's a small place, not sure if it'll be good for groups. The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"ONE CHEF RUNS THE ENTIRE KITCHEN. Service is slow. Food is AMAZING. This is like a home kitchen almost, a fast food joint where the chef has specials and sometimes does not have the things you want. Today was spicy miso ramen. It was probably the best ramen I've had in Toronto. And I search all over for the best ramen and that rich broth, firm noodles and fatty pork favour. Nobuya delivers TREMENDOUSLY. I couldn't ask for anything better on the ramen except I wish the noodles were a bit firmer, add an egg and minus the few ginger pieces. The broth was amazing.   I also got the takoyaki and karaage which were both phenomenal. Japanese poutine I could've skipped out on. Pretty basic.   Coming for another bowl and hope it's the classic tonkatsu broth this time. The meat he served was a beautiful fatty piece of pork. PLEASE COME AT ONCE AND BE PREPARED TO WAIT 45 mins for AMAZING RAMEN."}
{"text":"Super tasty ramen. This place has been on my list for some time. Friendly and passionate owner. I'II definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. Nobu, the owner, is a one man show at the moment. The food is the real thing. His broths are constructed with careful precision and you can taste the complexity of the natural flavours. He gives you the perfect amount of meat in the Ramen bowl. Another reviewer stated it was too much fat and I disagree, it was the perfect amount. It is the fat you want, which is potentially the umami everyone tastes about, not to mention it is excellent brain food. The broth is full of all sorts of nutrients we can only get from slow simmering meat bones. It is a lovely bowl of Ramen. It is a Tonkotsu base, which means pork bones. We also had the takoyaki, which are essentially a octopus croquette in ball form; it too, was lovely. The place is clean and the service is friendly. Spread the word as this place definitely deserves more attention. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"I was here the same night that Charles C was here.  Somehow, he rated Nobuya as a 5 star establishment. No way is that possible.  Like others have said, Nobuya is ran by a single person. The owner does the cooking, the ordering and the cleaning. On a personal level, I feel bad for the guy. But from a business and a consumer perspective, it REALLY isn't working out for him.   For example, during our dinner:  1) There were no clean tables. We had to wait for him to clean up a table before we could be seated. 2) We never received water during the entire night we were there.  2) We were given cutlery and napkins an hour after we put in our order. 3) We ordered at exactly 8:07pm. (We took photos with timestamps) Our ramen arrived at 9:52pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm.  4) We received spicy miso ramen even though we ordered regular soy ramen. I'm sure we didn't mess up the order because we pointed at his menu, which only shows soy ramen.   Here's the deal: Nobuya's food is actually not that bad. Their tempura udon was really good. The chicken karage was decently fried. The Japanese poutine was unique and tasty. And the ramen wasn't terrible even though we didn't want it spicy.  BUT... I really can't endorse this place. First, we waited 2 hours for him to complete our order. It wasn't even a full restaurant. He had only one other table. It took him two hours to complete two dinner orders!  Secondly, the prices are high. Ramen was $12.50 and it didn't even include an egg. Kinton, Sansotei, and Santouka are all cheaper than Nobuya and those are brand name ramen in downtown Toronto.   Third, yeah the food is good. But most of the menu is fried foods covered with sauce. It doesn't take a skilled chef to make fried foods taste good, especially when you mask everything with mayo, teriyaki sauce and cheese.  Charles C gave him a 5 star review and mentioned that it is a fast food joint. A fast food joint that takes 2 hours to turn a table? On a Saturday night with two patrons? C'mon. The review goes on to say that it's the best ramen in the city, but then adds that the noodles could be firmer, needed an egg and no ginger. Perfect score? I don't think so.   The biggest turnoff was when this chef gave us spicy ramen that we didn't even order. We never wanted spicy ramen. We wanted the soy. If you run out of the soy, that's fine but let us know. Don't try and sneak us spicy soy ramen without even notifying us.   Some people say that the wait time shouldn't factor into a review of the restaurant. I don't agree. No one should wait 2 hours for your order to be completed. And what if he has 6 tables that day? Would you wait 4 hours?   This place sucks. He can't run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicious foods and the owner is also very friendly. Recommend : Ramen and Okanomiyaki :) The owner said he would have Japanese curry soon :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Dumplings were phenomenal- everything was made fresh and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"When I try new restaurants, I'm always hoping to find that diamond in the rough. And it turns out Nobuya is absolutely one of those pleasant surprises. If you're only going to read the first paragraph, I'll say this - Come here before BlogTO catches wind of the place and permanently packs all the tables.  From outside Nobuya looks like any number of Canadian/Asian restaurants, and my wife and I must have walked by dozens of times without stopping by. After a peek at the menu piqued our interest, we finally went in for a meal and were just blown away.  Where Nobuya shines is in its authenticity. Toronto is dotted with Japanese restaurants, but actual Japanese management and staff is actually quite rare. Nobu, one of the most loveable proprietors I've ever met, is serving up the flavors of his home.  A \"Canadian/Japanese\" restaurant usually means Japanese food altered for the Canadian palate. However Nobuya sticks true to its roots, and what you'll find is lots of traditional Japanese food and a couple of Canadian favorites with an exciting twist. Two standout examples we tried include the okonomiyaki, which I haven't seen anywhere else in Toronto, and Japanese poutine, which is probably the prettiest plate of poutine I've ever seen. I know \"pretty\" is a weird adjective to use for poutine, but once you see the assortment of Japanese toppings arranged on top you'll totally understand.  If this restaurant was downtown, you wouldn't get a table. The food is fantastic, immaculately plated, and reasonably priced. However the location often leaves it overlooked. So take advantage. Don't make my mistake of walking by, go in and experience the exciting plates Nobu is whipping up."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, especially the karaage. If you like Japanese food then you should try this place."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found Nobuya. This place made me feel like I'm back to Tokyo the moment I walked in, as well as the service, the experience, and the food quality. Since it was only the owner working there that day, we did have to wait a little bit, but the food was well worth it! Will come back again and again and recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Real, premium Tokyo-izakaya food in Mimico?!?! It is so, friends! Call in for take-out, tho.  Nobu (?) admits that his service is slow by blazoning the tagline upfront: \"Nobuya: Worth the Wait\". And wait you will, because it's just him taking the orders, making the food, cashing out customers, and answering the phone. And worth it, it will be...  Forewarned, the two of us ordered a bunch of things: shiyo ramen (huge and yummy, even without extra noodles), karaage (deep-fried to perfection; clearly this man learned from the best izakayas in Tokyo), and fish and chips (ultra crispy, amazing fries). Presentation, taste, temperature all en pointe.  So if you're short on time, best to take advantage of this establishment by calling in for take out (we saw a smart regular customer do this and he was in and out within 5 minutes with his food).  This man obviously exists on razor-thin margins (i.e. the sorry state of trying to run a restaurant in Toronto) so we paid in cash & debit."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and avoid coming here. If you don't mind waiting over an hour and a half for your food and being upsold dishes, then sure, give this place a try. You will not be served water (because the owner wants you to order drinks while you wait an eternity for your food) and you might be harrassed to write a 5 star review. The owner comes off as friendly at first but he is very pushy and only cares about money. The food is not good, and definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"We tried the gyoza, karaage, and ramen tonight and all three were delicious. Nobu, the owner/server/chef was super friendly too. Will definitely return to this charming one-man shop ."}
{"text":"Great place, the food is awesome, chief is great. Food looks great and tastes great. Really recommend it"}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, food is very slow to come out.  But, he is a very pleasant person, highly apologetic, and most importantly, creates fantastic flavours.   He even warned me one time that takeaway would be about an hour, which was nice instead of just taking my order, unfortunately that time we went elsewhere.   Anyway, come here when you want great food AND have plenty of time for fast food :@)"}
{"text":"Truly is worth the wait.   We tried to visit once before gave up due to the wait. This time, we called ahead of time to place a take away order. We were told 40 minutes and still had to wait another 15 after arriving.  The Spicy Miso ramen was incredible. Tender pork, wonderful levels of flavour. The Haddock and Chips were as expected. A good fish and chip. Crispy batter, moist fish. Hit the spot. What stood out most were the takoyaki. Something new to me, and something that will have me coming back again and again!  The wait time exists because so much flavour, so much passion, and so much care, is going into this cooking. Everything is done with meaning. So if you're hungry but not starving, this place will surprise you. A tiny shop with a flavour punch in every bite!"}
{"text":"Amazing! And definitely worth the wait. The gentleman is cook, wait staff, busing tables, and acting as cashier all by himself. He's working very hard and the end result is totally delicious. I don't mind waiting a bit longer, or that my partner and I got our food separately. It wasn't the usual restaurant experience, no, but it was so worth it!  We shared an order of takoyaki and korokke. Both were delish! The takoyaki had just enough crunch on the outside, and a creamy texture inside. The korokke was piping hot and flavorful.  He had the karaage and fries, I had the unagi-tama don. The fries are excellent (I stole a few)! Fresh cut potatoes, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The chicken batter was light, crispy, and tasty. The meat stayed moist! My unagi-tama don was great. There was an omelette with some veggies plus the eel slices, over perfectly cooked rice and topped with spicy mayo, ginger, green onions, and shredded seaweed. The combination of flavors was just perfect.  Bottom line: Be patient and GO HERE! Support him! When he has a larger customer base, he can hire help, and things will be even better."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Nobuya and will definitely be returning in the future, however this restaurant has a heavy flaw that could easily be a deal breaker for some.  Food: 5/5  -authentic, delicious Japanese  -mostly fried, but excellently so (some of the best fries I've ever had)  -plating was artfully done  Service: 5/5**  -Owner is very friendly, though his English is quite poor  -**long wait time for food (I would HIGHLY recommend calling ahead of time for both take-out   and dine-in)  Decor: 3/5  -not much in the way of decor  -tables at the back are beside washrooms, not a problem so long as the door is closed, but  mildly odorous when it is open  As a long time fan of Sansotei, Santouka and Raijin (Yonge and Dundas ramen joints), I was thrilled to find that there was a Japanese-owned ramen shop in the west end. Nobuya is an interesting mixed-bag.     The food is unquestionably delicious and beautifully plated. The owner is exceedingly friendly and hardworking.  The problem is that he is the ONLY person working there.  He takes orders, preps/cooks/plates the food, and then works the cash at the end. These tasks makes it difficult to get the food out quickly, as my family and I experienced tonight.  We arrived at 6:45 on a Thursday night and our food arrived at 7:45.  This in itself is an almost inexcusably long wait time for a meal, however, I feel that in this case it IS excusable. I get the impression that Nobu is a perfectionist, you can see it in the plating and you can taste it in the food.  In true Japanese fashion, he takes his work very seriously and doesn't cut any corners. So you wait a while for your food, but in return you get to try his expression of Japanese fast foods.  Please give this place a shot, but please call ahead.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see this place has such a high rating... I wasn't going to write a review for this place but I think I need chime in.   My partner and I tried this place last summer and were seriously disappointed in both the quality of the food and the service. The owner was extreamly pushy and though I think he ment well he made both of us very uncomfortable. As we were parking he ran outside to try and convince us to come in, even though we fully intended to dine there already. While we were there he continued to run in and out of the building to solicite people in the street to come in. It was weird.   The wait for the food was extreamly long - over 30 - 45  min for each dish, and we were the only people there. When the food did show up it was extreamly disappointing. Everything was excessively deep fried and the oil tasted very old. The okonomiyaki was pretty much soaked with oil and it was all you could taste. We haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"Average across the board. A small snack bar in a far off corner of Etobicoke, Nobuya left much to be desired. Tucked away, it was a little out of place, hidden from the hustle and bustle of the city. Limited parking in the back and side of the place.   I came in with a decent level of expectations as I've heard many good things about their offerings. I left a bit of a flat note. I was accompanied by 2 other diners that night. The restaurants itself was not overly busy, though all seating were filled but there were about 10 diners in all. Service was understandable slow as there was only one front of house wait staff braving service.   They offered various typical Japanese snacks, sharable but definitely will not fill a normal person up. Between the 3 of us, we ordered 5 dishes worked out to about $23 per person. We wanted a wide variety so we ordered Takoyaki, karaage, pork donburi, Japanese poutine, and okonomiyaki w/ yakisoba.  First off, all the food were pretty much basted in the same mayo and unagi sauce, so very differentiation in taste between the dishes. The donburi was by far the table's fav. The rice was perfectly cooked and fluffy. The sauces worked well and the pork and egg was well marinated. The textures, flavours, and silky mouth feel left a nice sensation. It was missing a crunchy component but that's preference.   The takoyaki was average or a little below. It was too doughy, too cooked and lack the crispy to the outer shell. The flavour was good and price definitely were some of the cheapest I've came across. Strangely, it came out at a manageable temperature to eat (normally takoyaki comes out lovingly scorchingly hot).   The Karaage was not a favourite. Portion vs. price was a definite deterrent. The portion was on the small side. The chicken meat itself was bland and relies on the sauce and seasoning for flavour. It was strangely not crispy but chewy and tough. The ginger garnish did provide a nice and much needed contrast.   The poutine was not a favourite either. The hand-cut style fries was nice and starchy but was limp for the most part. By the time the fries came we were pretty much bored with the same sauces and flavour profile. Cheese was a scarcity on the plate. The bonito flakes didn't add much but aesthetics.   Last and least was the okonomiyaki and yakisoba. After the first bite, I gave up. The biggest issue I had was with the amount of oil that coated the dish. Next was the texture and overall execution. The okonomiyakis that I've has the chance to try were delicious; filled with cabbages and filling goodness to held together by a nice light batter. This okonomiyaki was very heavy with the batter, lacking fillings and notably formed using a mould of sort. The soba noodle had a toughness to it that was either pleasant or palatable.  The overall meal was a little below average. I would rate the 2.5 stars. The service was friend but slow. 45 minute in, we were still waiting for food. However, once the food started to roll out, it kept consistent pace, so no complaints there. I would personably not return mainly due to location and price, but I would definitely say it worth trying...especially if you crave some Japanese snacks and can't go to north York or Toronto for your fix."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was an excellent experience, we didn't mind waiting for our food and when it did come, we were amazed. I got spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend got the udon, and we had croquettes on the side. The croquettes were so good that we ordered a second portion. The owner and waitress were really friendly and gave us free spring rolls. The noodle soups hit the spot.  We tried visiting on 2 different occasions after but for some reason, the restaurant was closed. The hours shows that it should've been open but there was no notice of why it was closed. From there on, I always called to see if they were open because it seemed unpredictable.  The second time we went, I took my sisters along so it was a table of 4. This experience wasn't the greatest because it took almost 2 hours just to get our food. We had our order taken in a fair amount of time, but food took way too long. The side door was also open and the cold wind kept blowing in where we were sitting. We enjoyed our food but would not come back due to the wait time."}
{"text":"This place has no service at all and the owner has mental problem!!! Not sure why it still open!!!  We went on Friday night, there is just one table of guest inside. We sat down and asked for two cups of water and was told by the waiter/owner that they do not offer water and if we want, we have to buy bottle water. So we did not purchase any water as we thought this is ridiculous, in what world that resturant did not even offer water to the guest!   We then orderred two ramenand when was taking order, he forced us to order appetizer which we don't really need it. We explained to him that we are not hungry and just want to order two ramen. He then spoke in broken English 'no hungry, next time' and he repeated couple times rudely. So we just left.  Then when we are leaving, the waiter/owner happened to be out and he knocked at our window and asked why we take so long to leave. How weired he is!  In general very unpleasant experience and the owner defintely has mental issue!! Do not suggest at all!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is super sweet and genuine and you can tell he puts a lot of care into his dishes and customers. This place is definitely worth the wait if you have the time!  I love takoyaki and this one is easily the best I've ever tried because all the flavours balance nicely and it melts in your mouth. Also tried the karaage and chips which was really yummy and I got to taste the spicy ramen. I'm not a big fan of Japanese ramen which is why I liked this one in particular because the soup isn't as thick as it typically is at other restaurants.  Looking forward to trying the okonomiyaki next time!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with a lot of anticipation based on the pictures of the food and the reviews. I had hoped this would be a hidden gem but there were just so many flaws. Having read about the wait time, I came mentally prepared. However, I hadn't expected to wait nearly 2 hours for 4 dishes.   It was a Saturday night at 8pm. We were a party of 2 and had to wait for the owner to clean a table because none of them were clear of dishes from the previous patrons. No biggie. Another party came after us, followed by a pick-up order. That was all the traffic for the next 2 hours. The owner was friendly, making small chitchat with us as he cleaned the table. Asked us if we would like something to drink to which we replied water. It never came. I eventually took out a water bottle from my bag and drank from that instead.   At 8:10pm, we ordered the ramen, tempura udon, japanese poutine and chicken karaage. My boyfriend and I spent the next hour playing candy crush to kill time. At around 8:45pm, the owner came out holding a tray looking to set some stuff on our table. I got excited that it was our food but it ended up just being napkins and chopsticks.  Poutine came out at 9:10pm, karaage 9:17pm, tempura 9:25pm and finally the ramen at 9:45pm. I pretty much watched my boyfriend eat his udon (albeit stealing bites here and there) til he finished. Then it was his turn to watch me eat my ramen. So don't come here expecting a well-timed dining experience where you and your dining companions can feast together.   How was the food? Pretty good. I could tell the potatoes he used for the poutine ($6.99) were a higher grade but it was dressed and sauced with rather simple ingredients - seaweed, soy mayo and cheese. Karaage ($8.99 for 6 pieces) was tender and juicy white meat. Nice and crisp, drizzled in the same sauce. Solid dish but nothing groundbreaking. The highlight of the night was the amazing udon broth. So flavorful. Unfortunately, the tempura was already soggy by the time it was served. It may be personal preference but I wish it was given on the side instead.  I had so much expectations for the ramen ($12.49). Considering that I waited nearly 2 hours for it and the fact that it was on the pricier side with no egg...at this point, this was the one dish I wanted and NEEDED to be blown away by. It was really good but not all that amazing at that price. The menu DESCRIPTION and yelp photos indicated a soy-flavoured ramen but I was served spicy miso instead. First of all, I can't eat very spicy food. Second of all, this was a complete surprise because I was not informed prior in any way. We talked to the owner to which he said he ran out of soy-flavored ramen that night and could only serve spicy miso. But actually, he's going to be serving spicy miso ramen from now on. If he made the change that very day, I can overlook its omission from the menu. But if he ran out of the original flavor last minute, he should've mentioned it to me when I was ordering. Restaurant Managing 101. If I knew the ramen was spicy, I would've opted for something else instead. He apologized but lightly joked \"kids can't eat this level of spicy but adults is usually okay\". No, my issue was that you did not tell me.   All things considered, I left Nobuya rather disappointed and unhappy. I don't want to imagine how long the wait would be if there were more orders. This place is in the middle of nowhere, prices aren't cheap and the wait is just painfully long. I really don't think the food is good enough to make a trip if you don't live in the area. If you do, I suggest calling ahead to place your order. The food has some real potential, but they desperately need to make changes to the way they operate such as getting some additional workers or it's just not really sustainable.   It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place but it ain't worth the hassle. At this price and quality, I can dine at many other Japanese restaurants with a way nicer interior and be way less stressed."}
{"text":"Update: Got take out today for the first time. Today we have rice dishes instead of ramen or udon noodles.   Chicken katsu donburi Chicken karage donburi  Octopus balls   The difference between the two chicken dish is that one is Japanese style so small chunks of fried chicken and the other is classic breaded chicken breast. Both dishes had tender and juicy chicken. The only reason I am giving 4 stars vs 5 is that with the take our box, the rice and meat ratio was a bit off, too much rice! And the octopus balls while traveling got a bit too soggy. But the second part is more my fault than anything else...   Overall still delicious and the next time will be my 5th time here and will be there soon for sure."}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN IN TORONTO!!! like OMFG! I can't even explain how good the place is. It is a one man operation. So when it says it's worth the wait. Trust me it's not a lie! It's small and quaint. A hidden gem in this city and you all need to go!"}
{"text":"Went there 4/6 and 4/7, 2016, around 6PM.  Both days Nobuya was closed.  I am not sure if this means this place is closed for business permanently, but at least the owner should put up a sign on the store letting customers know when he plans to return and open.     Random closing can happen sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, but owner should be more responsible.  Time and gas is precious, and business owners who disrespects customer's resources should not be rewarded!!!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this cool hole in the wall in my area. The owner was a great host. Nobu is very kind and an approachable person.  The food is very tasty and flavourful. Love the takoyaki (but burnt my mouth because I am too impatient LOL ) We also had some Japanese cream soda drinks which was quite refreshing.  The restaurant is clean and also has  a nice patio. I will return to this restaurant again for sure!"}
{"text":"Quaint little place in the Mimico Area. Would highly recommend for legitimate Japanese comfort food.  Show the owner some love - nicest guy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, karage and takoyaki! The owner Nobu is extremely friendly  we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of Etobicoke! The food is great with exceptional service from the owners who prepares your food. I  do hope they get help so food can get out faster. Chopsticks fighting!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this gem. Amazing food with attention to detail. Better than downtown izayakas and ramen shops if you're don't want the frills and just quality food."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Chef cares about the customers enjoyment of the food. My new ramen place so glad I found it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The chef takes real pride in the dishes he prepares and it shows. At first I was hesitant to try the Japanese poutine but with the first bite, hesitation was out the window and I devoured it! Reasonably priced and portions are very generous. This is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent host, karaage, and udon.  Out of the way a bit, but worth tracking down.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I live right in the area and notice this restaurant only a couple months ago. I been in there twice but did not order anything as I was in a rush 1st time and then it was a crazy hot day and couldn't stand the heat in the resto. (It does get a bit stuffy but I'm only taking out do doesn't matter) I keep reminding myself to check it out soon. Well last night I finally did and gladly so. I know this will be my new go to take out stop when I dont cook. I smh as to why I haven't been earlier.  Had the fish and chips and it was really good. the owner does it all himself so while he was finishing the fish I was eating from the box of fries and couldn't stop eating them. They are light crisp not greasy and addictive. love them! Ordered a side of gyoza as I love those too (yeah I know it doesn't go. lol) they were good especially with his secret homemade sauce he gave me. We chatted the whole time he was cooking. he is very courteous, charming, pleasant and seems to really care about his customers. He throw in 2 free spring rolls (love) and even gave me 2 slices of cheesecake for half price he has from famous Mr. Tetsu that I cant wait to try!! will have it tonight and update my review. All in all a wonderful experience, great service, very yummy food, price is reasonable. Definitely will try the Japanese poutine next. Definitely will be visiting regularly for the ramen, fry chicken and everything else on menu. Definitely recommend. Great addition to Mimico, Etobicoke :)"}
{"text":"Incredible repertoire of Japanese staples, and an astounding degree of mastery for every item. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the karaage is something to die for."}
{"text":"Great place and great food... love it... ramen was great.. will go back to try their fish&chips in Japanese style ..  There are a lot of parking spots ... the owner is really friendly and nice! He does every position....   Recommend everyone go try his food .. it is worth to wait.."}
{"text":"I'll balance my review based on food, service, and atmosphere. For someone who runs a restaurant, I'll give it to Nobu that he makes good food.  There are not many Japanese places like his around the area.   I've been here in total 5 times but it is no longer a top choice for me.   Food: awesome. He nails each dish with Japanese flavour. Even for something simple like Karage it packs a punch. Simple clean options that can give you that happy feeling.   Service: I don't care if he is a one man shop, for someone whose Japanese culture praises the idea of efficiency he fails. No information on where the food is. You have a huge margin of inconsistency for arrival of food. The pushiness is arrogant and to me yells desperation. It's very easy to make a simple appetizer dish that folks can nibble on while they wait. You cant expect to make people wait as long as he does. Maybe he's in a downward spiral and doesn't know how to get out. Who knows.   Value comes from the experience. If Nobu just does something to offset the waiting with small snacks, then I think people would be willing to wait.   But it's clear from the reviews this is a try it place without much commitment. If you are lucky enough to come when it's open, which I never know when it is, then absolutely try it out. But after that one round, I recommend you save your time and go to another place that actually puts as much effort into their hospitality as they do food because you sure won't get that here."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly owner. You can tell he takes great pride in his work.    Like others indicated service is slow but it's kind of reminiscent of a old town Japanese restaurant you see in movies."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has become one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town. It's simple: the food is irresistibly delicious. There is not a dud on the menu. If there is a wait, stick it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th time here and it is still great. Nobu, the owner stayed open longer for me as I was running a little late. The KARAAGE was super soft and delicious. The soy ramen was rich and massive. And nobu again had extremely good costumer service. He was talking about getting the liquor license for the store which would definitely be a plus"}
{"text":"Me and my husband loves animes and would drool over takoyaki and ramen that Naruto, Soma-kun and other characters were eating! Lol so we looked for places that offers takoyaki (not a lot serves it) Mostly were located downtown without parking. Until we found this place online with good reviews.   So we went for take out, small place but lots of parking space. I was greeted warmly. I ordered 2 Takoyaki (of course) Japanese poutine (owners creation and boasting that the potatoes are freshly sliced everyday) really tasty; and ramen! Ramen was gòod too. He served it and explained some of the ingredients. We got free spring rolls for first time visit.   I loved the place so we went back for pick up around 9:40pm, almost closed! I asked husband to get the food so he can meet the owner. My husband came back 35 mins after. It's not because the fòod was slow but because they were chatting! The owner was very friendly and cheerful. You can't get such nice service very often so this place will be our favorite!"}
{"text":"Was craving Japanese food and was in the area and saw JFFya! Had favourable reviews so decided to give it a shot.  We ordered:  Yakitori - juicy tasty, I would order this again  Okonomiyaki - has squid, potato, and cabbage, this was really tasty, would recommend it  Karaage - it was pretty good, unique style, the meat was tender  Takoyaki - liked this alot, 6 big pieces and really filling and satisfying  Japanese poutine - this was okay, I would say it would be better with japanese curry as gravy, as it was sort of like fries with okonomiyaki garnishings  Overall, I really enjoyed the food, and the one man show, Nobu was a great host, really friendly and the food comes out fresh and hot. Only the food was a little slow to serve but the quality made up for it. Will come back for seconds  Tips: there's candy and ramune for sale"}
{"text":"Very good food and amazing service.   The only reason I am giving a four out of five is because it took a while to get the food. Having said that, It is a great restaurant and I wish the owner/operator all the success in the world.   I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food here!  My friends took me here for my birthday and we had a great time. The proprietor Nobu is probably the friendliest guy on Earth. His food is delicious but you may have to wait a little bit to get it since he is a one man show. We had  the ramen, the fish and chips, and shared a plate of takoyaki (fried squid balls covered in Worcester sauce and mayo)."}
{"text":"The slogan is \"Japanese fast food, worth the wait.\" Deceiving and definitely NOT worth the wait. If you are hungry do not go here because be prepared to wait for the food for 2 hours. The wait was so painful, every dish took 30 minutes to arrive. Ramen and udon took 2 hours and both were average. Karaage was delicious but the Japanese poutine, chicken skewers and fish and chips were nothing special. We had to cancel our plans because dinner took so long.   I commend the owner for being such a hard worker but he needs to hire more people!! My friend found an elastic band in her ramen. I get that mishaps happen but it could have been prevented if he wasn't so busy serving, cooking, cleaning and cashing out customers. Please...for your own health and sanity hire at least one more worker. This way you can also improve customer experience!"}
{"text":"Ahhh! This place is frustrating. Food is good but so many other things go wrong like ordering for delivery. The time I wanted to order tonkatsu ramen apparently it's sold out when I ordered as soon as he opened. Wow Nobu!!!! Wow!!! :(  Edit (Dec. 30,2017): Came here at 8pm and were told to come back at 9pm because he was busy and it's a one man show and he had customers he's attending to already. We tried to go elsewhere but called at 9ish anyways to see if he can take us in but he stated he got busy again. He said he'll be open tomorrow and we should go then. What total b.s.   Note to the owner, Nobu: It's a weekend, have someone help you run the restaurant so you don't lose business. PLEAAAASE!  Either way, won't be back here for sure. Will rather go d.t. where there's lots more options and you don't get this kind of service."}
{"text":"I honestly have no clue how this place has a four point rating. The wait times are ridiculous. It took them 1hr 25mins to bring out the appetizer we ordered. The mains...2 miso ramens are yet to make an appearance. It's been 1hour 45mins. Also the appetizer (chicken karage and chips) was very average."}
{"text":"I have never experienced this kind of service before. If I could give 0 stars I would. My wife and I were driving by and I started to get hungry around 11 pm and found this restaurant through Yelp. Was excited to find a place thats open late with good reviews. There was only a group of 3 people at the joint at this time. Since my wife wasnt hungry, she was going to nibble on some food from me, so I decided to get the okonomiyaki which he then he recommended to add the yakisoba noodles with. I obliged. This is where it got interesting. He asks my wife what she'd like and she said shes good and that she would just eat from me a little, however the guy/owner wouldnt take that. He kept insisting her to get a dish as he doesnt serve only one dish for two people as it is \"bad for business\". I couldn't believe this was happening. Its not like we were at a 4-5 star restaurant for him to even say that. In the end we walked out as he refused to serve us with only one dish. Before leaving he taps my back and says come back again when you both are hungry. I was simply stupefied by this whole experience and just laughed my out. We ended up at my go-to burger joint, Apache! Best late night food place to go to if you're hungry! :)"}
{"text":"This is a one man show - the sign outside reads Japanese Fast Food-Ya! but the owner (Nobu) intends to replace it soon.  Expect to wait but also expect it to be \"worth the wait.\" (We must have come at a good time because there were 2-3 other tables but we were in and out in 1.5 hours) Plus, once the food starts coming it comes pretty steadily. Enjoy delicious, greasy Japanese food (we had the Takoyaki, Karaage and the Okonomiyaki with Yakisoba noodles. Everything is packed with flavour and the owner/chef/server comes around to make sure you're enjoying your food and having a great time.   He's highly personable and a perfectionist about his food, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"let me start with HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 4+ STARS?.   Im new in the area and decided to trust my yelp recommendations and stopped by this restaurant.  When i approached to make an order the owner stated to me that in order to get my meal i need to order a side dish for 6.99+tax. The owner further stated that if i dont order the side dish it may take up to 40 minutes. So i ordered the udon and takoyaki.   1 hour passes by i still haven't received my order, mind you there was only about 4 people in restaurant. I then began to wonder why i paid the extra to get my food quicker and didn't even happen.   So finally i get my order. The taste was extremely mediocre im convinced that owner mustve paid customers to make good ratings. So upon finishing my meal being unsatisfying of the service i recieved i decided not to tip the owner. Once exited the owner followed me into the parking lot and proceeded to act aggressive towards me demanding a tip. I kindly advised that tips are earned from service and he did not deserve any. The owner continued to act violent towards me and other customers from the restaurant came out to defend me.   AVOID EATING THIS PLACE AT ALL COST   THE OWNER IS VERY VIOLENT AND DISHONEST ALL HE CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. I WILL BE MAKING A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE CITY REGARDING THIS MATTER."}
{"text":"Just tried out this place for the first time, and I'm glad I did!  My wife and I were greeted by the owner, Nobu, who is a really friendly and hospitable host.   The restaurant is clean and has a nice comfortable feel. I ordered the Tokyo Shio ramen and the food was delicious. The soup was flavorful and the noodles were the right texture. Overall, a really excellent experience!    The kitchen was staffed only by the owner, so expect a bit of a wait. The wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing service, the guy runs a one man shop and you can clearly tell when you taste his food. The karaage is a must try here.  I would recommend booking 1-2 hours out of your schedule however. As it is a one man shop, it takes a while for everything to be made and served. It is worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I know why this place is well reviewed. Owner keeps on pressuring you to rate 5 star when the service was extremely slow and the food wasn't that great. We stopped by here for dinner on our way home when we saw the review. We waited for about 45 minutes to get our food. The food itself was just OK. Nothing special. Soba, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was bland. At the end of dinner,he kept on asking me to rate 5 when he found out I'm on yelp and offered discount if he sees a 5 star review. Turned me completely off."}
{"text":"Nobu is a very cheerful and good hearted man. He has worked hard to build the restaurant from ground up. I had the karage and okonomiyaki for take out as well as a bowl of ramen for dinner. They were good and reasonably priced.   I would recommend everyone to support Nobu and give his restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"First, I must caveat by saying before I came here, I wasn't aware that a \"longer than normal wait time\" was normal here. I also didn't know it was a one man shop - I just thought other staff wasn't available that night. My rating doesn't only take into account food, but how I felt of the service and experience overall.  I came here to meet a friend after work on a Thursday night - we decided to find a place to meet in the middle last minute so a quick yelp search led me here as location wise, it was good and the overall star rating was decent. I should've read the reviews first though..  I arrive and I was a bit confused a bit about the parking situation - I just parked in the back and hoped for the best. The location was different... I was expecting this place to be in a plaza but it looks like a house.  I was greeted and seated immediately. but then upon sitting down was asked to move because he forgot he had reservations made for that table. He also stressed that he's very busy today although at the time, I only saw one table seated with a group of 4.  After I moved, he gave me a menu and proceeded to attend to the other table. I didn't get any water or anything.... which sucked because I was super thirsty but I had a hard time finding the guy cuz he was busy in the kitchen.  When we were ready to order, he let us know because he's so busy (probably 6 other patrons at the time), the wait time for our meal will likely be 40-50 minutes which took us aback. He suggested we order an app in the meantime while we wait which would take about 20 minutes so we did. Takoyaki was good and fresh. 15 minutes or so after we placed our order, I still didn't receive any water even though I asked for it. I see the guy serving food and water to the first table and reminded him for water and he served it right away. In the end the food was good (I got the Unagi don). I ordered the unagi tamago don but he gave me the wrong bowl but I guess it was my mistake for not noticing until he rang me up because I noticed my dish was more expensive than I anticipated.  In the end, I was not happy with the overall experience and that was reflected in the tip. Yes, the food was good but honestly, the wait time was unbearable. If you have the patience to wait then yes, this place has great food. But I found it a bit silly when another patron wanted to order take out and she had to ask the owner \"Hi can I place my order now?\" as it seems like she has been patiently waiting. I understand it's a small shop, there's only one guy and he's honestly doing his best but seriously... if you want to grow the business and give customers a good experience, you need to add another staff at the very least... It's really not fair to them to keep them waiting."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Nobuya. My bf and I decided to check out this spot on a week night after being too lazy to cook. This was our 2nd attempt to visit as we tried coming here for lunch on a weekday once and it was closed so one recommendation to Nobu (the owner) is to update his business' hours of operation! We were the only patrons during our visit so had an in depth conversation with Nobu who is from Tokyo and was very friendly, giving us tips on our upcoming visit to Japan. We ordered a ramen and tonkatsu don. The food was made to order, using some premade/frozen ingredients, but tasted delicious and fresh. I personally really liked the tonkatsu don but the ramen was only decent in my opinion. We also ordered a seafood pancake to start which was my favourite dish of the night. The ambience is nothing to rave about, very simple, inexpensive furniture but the place itself appeared quite clean. The prices were reasonable and affordable. I'll definitely be back for those nights I'm too lazy to cook and want some good Japanese food :)"}
{"text":"An absolute diamond in the rough.  The best dumplings and Ramen by far over any Japanese restaurant in the entire City."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Unfortunately it's not as fast as one would expect but it is because he ensures everything is done right. It's under new management and I often speak with the owner and it's easy to see he is a great person. It's a shame this business doesn't receive as much attentiom as it does. I highly recommend the donburi or hailbut fish and chips. Best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Really good street food! Its a small eat-in / take-out place. This is a dedicated one man operation. If you have the patience to wait for your food its well worth it. He does all the cooking and serving and does a great job. Really friendly, courteous and humble yet passionate, is what exemplifies the fusion of Canada and Japan. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've held off going to this place for the longest time because I thought the name was going to reflect the food. The signage outside says \"Japanese Fast Food Ya\" so I expected cheap and not great food.  Fortunately I trusted the Yelp reviews and noticed they are listed as a different name here which is sounds like they are switching over to and gave it a try.   I ordered the Karage and Chips on my way home from a TFC game. Even though I had to walk home with the food it still was AWESOME when I got it home. The chicken was super tender and the fries were surprisingly some of the best fries around! Who knew!  I am definitely going to be back to try some more of the food because it seems like the owner / chef really knows what he is doing and this is definitely a hidden gem for the area."}
{"text":"service: super friendly  Size : BIG Wait time: 15-20 min ( take out ) Taste : Good  Price:$  One owner run the whole restaurant~~ can't complain... We should support small restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait but it is totally worth it. Food is excellent and Nobu is a great host!"}
{"text":"Things here are delicious and the price is right, but service is slooooooooow (albeit super friendly); their slogan is \"worth the wait\" and it truly is!  We ordered the tacoyaki (little dough balls with octopus) and they were perfectly done, hot, light and super flavourful...NOMNOMNOM! The Tsukune (chicken patties) were more like meatballs, still tasty, but not exactly what I expected. The fish and chips are good, the coating is a little thick, but still super crispy and this fish is super moist inside; the tartar is delicious, though it's really the fries that take the cake for me...AMAZING FRIES! The ramen was delicious as well; it was hot, super flavourful and quite large!   If I had one suggestion, it would be order for pick up because it's a long wait! (Lucky for us the Russia vs. Canada hockey game was on:P) A surprising number of people do this too!"}
{"text":"Amazing unique Japanese comfort food who is operated by the most hard working, kind hearted Japanese man/owner/cook/server. There is a longer wait, but that's because he puts so much thought and care into what he cooks. Also understand that he is a one man show and isn't at the scale where he can have other employees (hopefully that will change soon)!  The inside is the cutest and you can tell how much he loves Canada (the logo is half a Japanese flag and half blue jays leaf). The owner himself is from Tokyo but moved to Canada 5 years ago.  Everything we had was amazing , octopus balls, Japanese pancake with noodles and the spicy miso ramen. Also be sure to try out the Japanese soda - really yummy!!!  Definitely will be coming back again for the food and visit Nobu of course!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:20pm on a Tuesday night. The owner/chef/server immediately seated us and gave us the menu. We put in our orders at 8:30pm. 20 minutes later we had to ask for our glasses of water again. By 9:20pm the fish & chips came out. At 9:30pm the udon. At 9:45pm we had to ask about the ramen as the rest of the table had already finished their dishes. It wasn't until 9:50pm that the ramen finally came out.   There was only one other table in the small restaurant with us, who also experienced and complained about the long wait.  The food was great and tasted very authentic, but definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. It's unfortunate because the customer service was good. But he was a one-man show: taking down orders, cooking the food, serving the table and handling payment, all by himself.  He apologized for the wait, but we would not be returning until there are some major improvements with the waiting time."}
{"text":"Not a great place to come if you're in a rush or bordering hangry symptoms. Perfect if you have time to chat and don't mind waiting while Nobu runs his restaurant solo. The menu is simple and stacked with Japanese favourites. We tried the takoyaki udon, karaage and chips, and spicy miso ramen. All three were delicious and we can't wait to come again. Also super excited that it's in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"This place is unique for sure.  The wait time is very very long (1 and a half hours) because the owner does everything from cooking to cleaning etc.  It seems drinks were a push to sell on everyone.  I will not ding him on the wait time because it was expected (not that I like waiting that long to eat unless it's free gourmet food).  However the noodle base was so packed with sodium I thought a heart attack would be imminent.  The taste during and after was salt...  pure salt.  In this case perhaps too much soy.  $14+tax for that was way overpriced.  I would have enjoyed packaged noodles more with one tenth the sodium.  Definitely made bloating and discomfort a negative for this place.  Tap water early on would have been a nice offer.  The appetizers are tasty and they come out in decent time.  However the push and urge to provide a 5-star review on all outlets as the bill came was a huge buzz kill.  It was as if we had to do that on the spot before leaving the premises.  Another reason to take reviews with a grain of salt because this can happen especially at really small places that aren't so popular.  Owners that do well and please customers don't push for biased rave reviews.  On top of the push to provide a 5 star review there was an extra item on the bill that was not ordered.  That just did it for me providing this review rather than ignore it and never return.  The extra line item charge was another indication that things were not right.  There weren't more than a few people so it was not confusion it was intent.  I think desperation is kicking in here.  I can sense something is really off at this place.  Update: I just realized that the owner pointed out a pot that was empty and grimy looking to prepare ramen.  So why did we wait 1 1/2 hours for 2 small bowls?  Clearly he did not create a new batch for just the two of us in a massive pot that could feed 200 people.  Probably used instant noodle package.  DINER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in mimico serving authentic Japanese food in a comfortable and compact setting.   The chef was friendly and immediately recognized my friend and I have never been to his restaurant. This shows that the chef pays attention to each and every customer and remembers them. He engaged in conversation before taking our orders which made me feel more like a guest rather than a customer.  The tonkotsu shoyu ramen was delicious and was packed with a generous serving of noodles. Trust me, you get your money's worth of noodles. The pork slices were soft and cooked well. The broth tasted rich and flavourful, but seemed a tad oily. Overall, the ramen was a good choice and I would get it again.  I also tried the Japanese poutine, which was delicious as well, and generously portioned.  From the food to the service, this establishment was a pleasant experience. Nobuya would be exponentially busier if located in a better and more visible area.  Lastly, be prepared to wait around 30-40 minutes if there are other people. It seems that he runs the business by himself."}
{"text":"Nobu was amazing as his ramen soup. Really good food industry service guy. Oops.. i already miss his ramen while im writing review lol."}
{"text":"Friendly one-man run shop. The owner is both the host, waiter, cook and pushy salesman.    Expect to be cross-sold and upsold on his delectable eats that are a bit pricier than normal.  While we enjoyed the food, my wife and I were not sure if we'd come back again and endure the wait for our food.  Hence, we've only gone once... and that was a while ago."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, food, and Nobu's passion for food.  Is he a little quirky and weird? Yes. Will you wait a long time for food? Yes. Should he probably change the tagline \"fast food\"? Yes.    He is genuinely good person, immigrated from Tokyo, and genuinely loves food, Japan and Canada - it's evident by the way he decorates the place (you'll se what I mean). Totally understand that there are 1 stars for the service, so if you are in a hurry, definitely don't come here. But the food is amazing for the price that it's at, and I give a lot of credit to any entrepreneur trying to make it and pursue his passion."}
{"text":"See if this review were solely based on food I'd give it a solid four but considering the number of times we have drove by and it's been closed on days it says is opened just puts a bad taste in my mouth. The opening hours are so inconsistent that we've not been back since the first time because we just can't rely on him being opened that day. I would never bring friends here due to that very reason. He needs to hire staff or either close shop, to be honest."}
{"text":"It is a hidden gem for me and my partner. We want to keep it on our secret dinning list rather than sharing it here.  This place offered the lightest ramen broth in Toronto. Not oily at all. I am impressed how tasty it tasted. Well worth of 2 hrs wait inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is not at all what it seems. Hole in the wall kinda vibe, a bit hard to spot, and super low key in every way. Looks like it used to be an old diner.   But it. Is. Great. It's effectively Japanese comfort food, and it's legit. We ordered like six things, and polished every plate. The ramen broth is amazing, the apps are yummy, and the Japanese poutine is super tasty too.   They're also the nicest people. Don't expect anything to be fast (despite the \"fast food\" on the sign) but it is honestly worth the wait. It's a totally random addition to the neighborhood, but an amazing find :)"}
{"text":"The design was like a French dish and chef really tried to have a great design. The taste was different with others food that I try until now . The customer service was great. All restaurant managed with just one gentleman , and this Japanese man was really respectful. The price was reasonable ( not expensive) , The only negative thing was the smell of restaurant. I didn't like this smell but maybe it's not a bad point because the smell was like another common Chinese or Japanese restaurant . I really like to come back to this restaurant again for trying another food  in menu ."}
{"text":"One man shop. Great food and friendly service however not a quick place to grab food. Karaage and tonkatsu ramen were excellent! I would go again."}
{"text":"Finally open after going 2 days in a row to discover that they were randomly closed.  I messaged the owner to ask if he was permanently closed and he was very apologetic and offered 10% off the next time I dined in.  I never took him up on his offer because I felt bad.  Owner is very sweet, personable, and will describe what he is presenting, and inform you of the ingredients.  Yes, he runs the place on his own, but as he explained, he is not busy enough to hire someone for a minimum of 4hrs.  So he is keeping his costs down.  As per the other reviews, yes, he does grab frozen food from the freezer that is located where the tables are.  I'm sure that many restaurants use frozen foods as shortcuts, but you would never see it as blatant as this.  So, to me, that was an automatic of a turn-off.  STICK TO: -  Donburi dishes &/or maybe -  fried foods  I had the Ramen in spicy miso broth ($12.49) and the broth was oily, quite spicy, & extremely salty.  The owner did explain that broth was made from chicken/pork bones, but I have never had it that greasy in any place that I've eaten it, re:  Momofuku, Kenzo, & a coupla places in Vancouver.  Grease aside, I usually drink my broth, but I couldn't enjoy this due to the sodium overload.  Since I saw the use of frozen foods, it makes me question everything else.  Is the broth a MSG-package?    As per the other reviews, food does take time to roll out, so do not go HANGRY.  Suggestion: That they provide free green tea or at least water to drink while waiting for food.  \"AMAZING\" as an adjective for the food is a hyperbole.  Food is more like 2-2.5, ignoring courteous service."}
{"text":"-no water/tea available as one would expect from a japanese establishment -took a REALLY long time to make  -service was really homely (touched EVERYTHING-chopsticks/napkins multiple times, chairs and jacket too) -$9.99 tempura soba noodle soup was a soggy mess (deep fried.. celery? and mushed tempura shrimp) -$5.99 karaage and fries were decent (but unsatisfying - i think too much deep fried in one dish - nothing light to offset it?? ) -atmosphere/seating was really dingy - i think they are definitely aiming for fast food, as the name implies -- not on par with even food court quality though... - would not recommend"}
{"text":"This is an awesome.place to eat. Great quality for the price. The unagi is delicious and takoyashi superb.  The owner is Japanese and has taken the quality of his food seriously. Very nice service as well."}
{"text":"Casual Japanese diner with no sushi (in a good way!). Relaxed atmosphere and the food is tasty and unique. Friendly service. Patience for the food to be prepared is sometimes needed when it is busy; best to go non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Need your fix of legit Japanese? This is the place. One man operation, original recipes, fresh ingredients. This is not a place simply run by Korean or Chinese folks. This place is seriously some good real Japanese food.   Order the Tacoyaki, the Japanese poutine, Okonomiyaki (with the Yaki Soba), you know what? Get all of it.   I've been to a few Japanese spots and this one has by far left the biggest impression on me.   The guy is super friendly and is working to get his patio going. Booze will be here not until a while but for now, enjoy the fantastic food.   10/10"}
{"text":"Nobuya continues to prepare good food and exhibit a courteous attitude towards customers. His passion is certainly there. Honestly, I really wonder how much longer he can continue the one man show stunt. It's hard to refer more friends over here given wait times.  Hiring wait staff (part-time at least) will help him, the restaurant and customers (current and future) in the long run. I know running a restaurant is challenging especially with such a remote location. But I'm sure that everything will fall into place for him given his success so far"}
{"text":"Came here for snack around 530pm.  Ordered Japanese style fries ($7.99) and Takoyaki (8pcs for $5.99)   FOOD IS AMAZING! The fries were very unique & a good for two snack! Takoyaki tasted great too!   -1 for the wait time. It took an hour to get our order. Not even busy that time. But gotta give credit to the owner for the quality of food. Will come back if I have lots of time to spare."}
{"text":"Haven't had such delicious food in a while. Ok maybe that's not entirely true but this food was refreshingly good!  I've always wanted to check out Nobuya because I wanted to try okonomiyaki. I've watched too many YouTube videos of it so I was dying to try it. However, every time I wanted to visit Nobuya it's been closed. So tip#1: check out the hours on its website before heading over. Best would be to call and confirm. But like the tagline inside the restaurant reads, \"Nobuya, worth the wait...\" it's quite true. It was truly worth the wait. There's a flip side to it though: service is slow. The owner/chef works alone so it does take time for the food to arrive.  My girlfriend and I ordered the Tsukune/Yakitori, which are deep fried chicken meatballs on a skewer with spicy mayo. These were solid. A bit oily sure but still very tasty.   My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu Donburi, which was good too. She couldn't finish it but she never finishes a dish anyways   The star of the night was... *drumroll* Okonomiyaki  My god. Everything about this dish was perfect. The presentation, the variety of textures, the balance of flavours, the level of spice. I'm really glad the chef/owner recommended that I order it with Yakisoba because a) it was filling and b) the noodles really complement the okonomiyaki nicely.   The chef/owner is the nicest guy ever. Although he's also a really good salesman. I wasn't going to get a drink but he somehow convinced me to get a Japanese carbonated drink which was $3.50  No worries though restaurant business is hard, I get it.   All in all, if you haven't checked this place out please do so. Just make sure you check the hours before you go. Truly one of the gems in the Mimico area."}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner here on Friday night.  It was busy but Nobu had his twin brother and father helping him this night.  It made a huge difference in terms of speedy service.  Often it's a bit of a wait for your food.  We both had the okonomiyaki.  It was very good and quite filling.  Being a very informal place, Nobu's father sat with us for awhile and chatted.  All in all, it was a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. The owner is incredibly nice and really, truly cares about the food he is sharing with you. Yeah yeah yeah, it takes a little bit to get your food, but it's well worth it, as it's a one man show. At first when I came in I was little off put by how long it was taking, but the second that those little fried octopus balls touched my mouth I was in absolute bliss. The Japanese spin on the fish and chips was a pleasant surprise. I will be coming back here every time I visit Toronto. 12/10"}
{"text":"Very good and authentic ramens! Wife and I came here first time, and we are super impressed by the ramens here. Amazing. The owner is nice and friendly as well. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is very unique, nice destination for family's and friend meetings. 1. Place is clean and  decorated with love  2. Clean and nice washrooms 3. There is a patio! 4. Free parking! 5. Nice music and even sport chanel is on, so you will not miss your fav game!  And, of course:  6. Great comfy food: well balanced taste and awesome plating which is not so usual for this small types of comfy food restaurants in Toronto (his trick with bonito flakes is a must see!) 7. The owner (his is a chef and a server, so it's worth to wait) is an interesting person, he could tell you about Japan and Vancouver and even, how to open a restaurant if you are so lucky to get him at a quiet night. So, come and see him on Mondays' evenings or Sundays' evening to have a chat.   Overall, good impression leaved by the place where a customer matters. So unique for Toronto"}
{"text":"The place was closed way before stated working hours! The owner highly unprofessional!"}
{"text":"This place was great. My boyfriend and I came here because he had found it online. The place was a bit difficult to find and finding parking was fine.   When we entered the place the owner/cook/whoever was super friendly   The menu is made of Canadian and a Japanese type of fusion. We ordered the Pork ramen and gyoza. We waited about 10 min for the dumplings and the ramen came 10 min after aprox. Since the (I suppose) the owner is the only one working. The gyoza was pan fried perfectly, and the ramen was supper tasty. The Pork in the ramen was very tender and flavorful.   So the only downside of our first visit was the waiting time, though it was worth it. And how the ramen was quite oily."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice.  First time: We shared karaage, I ordered the spicy miso ramen, and my husband got the okonomiyaki. Karaage was SO GOOD. I haven't had it ever before so I have nothing to compare to, but it was pretty darn good. My spicy miso ramen was good, had great flavour and the perfect amount of spice. The meat itself had a lot of fat though - like I'm talking half an inch thick off a piece of what looked like a brisket. It may be just part of the dish/flavour but I probably wouldn't order this again only because there is so much fat (unless it was a one-time thing?). My husband loved the okonomiyaki, he just wishes it were bigger. He says it is the best that he's had anywhere.   We went on a Friday or Saturday night around 8:30pm. Not a single soul in the place. We were in and out in 45 minutes.   Second time We ordered karaage, takoyaki, korokke, my husband had the okonomiyaki, and I had the okonomiyaki with yakisoba noodles. Karaage was delicious as usual. Takoyaki was great - we had takoyaki once before at a different place for the first time and didn't like it. We tried it again here at Nobuya and it was AMAZING. Korokke was great, nothing super special but really really good. Okonomiyaki was delicious as usual. Okonomiyaki with yakisoba noodles was also amazing  - I'm a noodle person! We definitely recommend all these dishes.   We went on a Wednesday around 7-7:30pm. There were two other tables who hadn't gotten their food yet, the first table got their food soon after we got there. We were in and out in an hour and a half which is not bad in my books considering he's a one man show."}
{"text":"Found this place by googling the best ramen in Toronto and they did not disappoint. Amazing food. Friendly owner. Legit ramen. Yummy takoyaki. One of my favorites for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Only one guy so it takes a bit don't come here in a rush! Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to the neighbourhood, I had driven past Japanese Fast Food-Ya! A few times and was intrigued.  A Japanese place in Mimico?  What the heck?!  And not only that.. A Japanese owned Japanese restaurant in Toronto?!  I knew that this place would be special as soon as I saw it.  Tonight I went there for some takeout and wow... Was it ever good.  I had a half hour conversation with Nobu and his father and we ordered the Japanese poutine (a very unique take on poutine- with nori, green onions, cheese, spicy mayo, pickled ginger, kewpie mayonnaise, Bonito flakes),  ramen (the broth was out of this world!!  Beating any overly salted hipster spot downtown...plus with all the most authentic fixings and al dente noodles!), pork donburi (my husband declared it to be amazing) and pork gyoza (I've never met one I didn't like.). He also threw in a few spring rolls too which was well appreciated.  Then, he presented it beautifully on the counter.  Probably the only time I've ever seen that happen for takeout.    My only suggestion for improvement would be to add some Japanese drinks... Some pocari sweat or calpico would make this my dream spot.    I will most definitely be back- this place is a true gem!"}
{"text":"They have tasty food and the owner is really nice person, I really enjoyed their food last night and would recommend to give a try! I don't remember the title of the meal but it had omelette with eel and is one of the best things I have ever tried  !"}
{"text":"Adorable Japanese restaurant in a quaint area in Etobicoke. The owners are very pleasant and engage in conversation with you after your meal. Spicy miso ramen was very good with the right amount of spice (not salty) and portions were generous. Chicken karaage was lightly breaded and crunchy. Chicken Donburi tasted homemade; a great spot to hit up if you want authentic Japanese food!"}
{"text":"This was our first time having anything Japanese other than sushi/sashimi/tempura. There's not a lot of decent, local quick service options in the Mimico/New Toronto area that are not Pizza. We've eaten at Nobuya the last two Saturday's to try different things on the menu. We've had the Japanese Poutine (which is fishy and rich and spicy and the fries are perfect), Karaage (my fiancé says it's amazing, I'm a vegetarian so I will take his word for it) the Agedashi Tofu - another hit - fried to perfection on the outside and seasoned lightly - warm and soft on the inside. The portion of Agedashi was so big I ate it over two meals. I overheard one of his other customers suggesting that he get frozen fries and he politely and firmly explained that it wasn't the quality he wanted to serve...he literally goes to the back and chops the potatoes before frying them, guys. The food is exceptionally high quality and great value. The owner and chef is on his own, starting a fledgling business in an area that is not high traffic, so he isn't yet making enough to employ another staff person to help him, thus I suppose things take a little longer than the quick service we are used to...We called in our 4 dish order this weekend for pick-up and it was ready when we arrived to pick it up 30 minutes later. We're pretty happy to support a local business like Nobuya...especially when the food is this good."}
{"text":"The Tokyo ramen was good. I prefer it over Kenzo. The Gyoza and Tokoyaki were good. No complaints with food. However, a common theme is wait time. To be honest I didn't mind due to the fact it is a one man show. He was super nice. Visit when you have plenty of time. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent fish & chips, and Japanese chicken. He does chips properly, and will tailor the salt to your tastes.  His food is never too greasy. Even when you do take out, the box won't be soaked in grease like it can be at other fish and chip joints. And you can tell he changes his oil regularly.  I've had the Chicken Katsudon, and Halibut, both were great. The food is made to order, so you will have a bit of s wait, and the store can get pretty stuffy in the summer, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it did not measure up. My husband wanted to go based on the high ratings on yelp. I saw Stephanie S review and she's quite accurate...should have avoided this place. The 5/5 rating is a bit surprising...many 1 reviewers though.  The food was really just not good. Nobuya...more like nooooo boooooo yah. Japanese food are usually light and fresh but this is very fried and fatty. A lot of it does taste like frozen food. Maybe poor turn over so the food is not very fresh tasting.  The fries were the only edible thing. It was nice and crunchy but I think it's quite hard to mess up fried potatoes.   The karaage was kind of soggy with all the sauces and it wasn't quality chicken. For 5 pieces, it is a bit expensive. The pork katsu was full of sodium. More breading than there are of pork. I had two bites. I couldn't taste chicken in the chicken skewers...tasted cheap fried dough only.  Overall not worth the price tag for horrible Japanese Mickey D's version."}
{"text":"It took very, very, very long to get our food. It's a one man show. The owner was cooking and serving and he was insanely busy. Tried the pancake amongst other things. Overall the food tasted good but it was SO oily, we felt so bad for hours after eating. Even though we live down the street and want to give it another try, I'm afraid if the oiliness and pretty much everything is deep fried."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain (Yelpers should have a good idea of this man) has a television series out on Netflix called, \"The Mind of a Chef\".  In the first season, we're introduced to Chef David Chang who takes us through his inspirational journey of ramen.  Kenzo seems to be one of the more popular ramen noodle restaurants in Mississauga, definitely a great avenue to get that \"quick fix\"...but after binge watching this show and learning the complexities of ramen, I wanted to experience ramen beyond the \"chained restaurant\" atmosphere.  Nobuya advertises itself as \"Japanese Fish & Chips\" - my first encounter here was exactly that, fish & chips.  My boyfriend and I ordered take out, before leaving a couple dining-in suggested ordering the ramen (must dine-in).  As a result of my current obsession with ramen, the boyfriend and I ended up at Nobuya Saturday evening - this was our second visit after 3 months?  Walking into Nobuya we already knew what we were going to order (FYI: there is only 1 selection for ramen), we ordered 2 ramen bowls.  Service is extremely, dare I say...painfully slow.  Nobuya is a ONE-MAN show, so be prepared.  I believe there was 2 take-out orders, and a couple ahead of us - we waited an hour and 20 mins to get our ramen.  Once you've practiced patience, you're rewarded with one of the best ramen in Toronto (5 stars) - you'll start rationalizing why you waited so long for a bowl of soup.   Why the 3 stars Ash?  Overall Nobuya is 3 stars, below is the break down;  Décor: 1 star *.  Fluorescent lighting needs to be changed, tables and chairs rearranged (or maybe invest in some new furniture all together), new paint should be considered etc.  Staff: 5 stars *****. Like I said, its a one-man operation - this guy is super friendly and kind, he just needs some extra hands. Wait time (for food): 1 star *. If you're hangry, just avoid all together.  Food: 5 stars *****.  Well-prepared.  Great presentation. Amazing taste and flavor! Fairly priced (Ramen = $12.49) Overall: 3 stars ***.  ~ No pitty stars included ~"}
{"text":"Found this while looking for a Japanese spot near Queensway cineplex. The chef is very humble and food is delicious so I will definitely return for dinner after movie nights. Since it is a one man show, it takes time so if you are ordering ramen- it has to be fresh and not precooked so don't go there starving. I ordered the poutine and it was amazing!"}
