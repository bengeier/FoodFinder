{"text":"Ordered from here many times and they never disappoint. Tried a lot of dishes already and all are very tasty, especially the pad thai noodles and mango salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food - prepared fresh and served hot - authentic. The service was extremely friendly and each course was brought to us in good time.  Happy that the restaurant has reopened. Very clean."}
{"text":"Had food delivered from here. The Tom Yum soup while flavourful, the chicken was overcooked and the soup had too many carrots. The pad Thai was bland. Needed more lemongrass. The spring rolls were bland and cold. Ugh. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Been before and found the food reasonable.  Last night, however, I was calling for fifteen minutes to place an order for pickup, we were under a time crunch, and just kept getting voicemail after several rings.  Eight times I tried to call over that time, and no answer.  Ended up picking up Japanese food instead."}
{"text":"On the expensive side for what you get.  $6 for 3 small springrolls - so not worth it.  That's like $2 per roll - what a rip off - and there is nothing special about them.  I had the vegetarian pad thai - it was very bland - nothing special.  I was expecting something special given the price - but it was so off the mark.  The decor was nice."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times and both times I had the Pad Thai and it is truly the best Pad Thai around. It might be a bit too authentic for some. I did try the beef with broccoli, not good.  They do smile here a lot but not friendly. Hard to explain, I think it is the authenticity of the smile. Just not there. I will go back and try a few more dishes. In the mean time, best pad Thai by far!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to commend them on delivering the food super fast. it was like i just hung up the phone and the door bell was ringing. They deliver to leslieville for anyone in this hood who is interested.
Our order consisted of hot & sour soup (which they assured me uses vegetable broth), shrimp panang curry for the boy and a vegetable royal pad thai for myself. 
The Hot & Sour soup was oddly sweet but maybe it's because I'm recovering from being sick and this was my first proper meal in a a couple of days.  At first i thought my pad thai tasted a bit sweet too. Maybe being sick caused my taste buds to play tricks on me. 
The soup was thick and once i got past the (maybe imaginary) sweet side of it, I enjoyed it.  Warning, if you're vegan, there's egg whites in it.
The Royal Pad Thai didn't have any signs (taste-wise and visually) of ketchup. The noodles got a bit mushy but the taste made up for it. It didn't have a fishy taste (i know many pad thai's use fish paste but I'll pretend this one didn't).  My appetite had shrunk to a pea-size but even if I had a healthy appetite, the food portions would have been more than enough. The shrimp panang curry got a thumb's up too. Keep in mind though, rice has to be ordered separately. I hope that next time I order, I can pick up the food myself and bring my own containers to make use of their eco-friendly take out incentive (13% off if you provide your own containers)."}
{"text":"Terrible! We had food delivered from this place on friday and it was a disaster. The Thai calamari was greasy and super soggy. The pad thai was completely tasteless - just some noodles with a weird sauce and peanuts. It was supposed to have shrimp and chicken. Found one shrimp and barely any chicken. No thai basil or lemongrass. ugh! and the chef's special Karee was especially bad - four pieces shrimp floating with a bunch of overcooked veggies and a runny liquid. 

Worst of all - i found a piece of plastic floating in the curry as well.  I really hoped it would be a great place as its really close to us - but never again."}
{"text":"This is where I get my Thai fix. 
Best green papaya salad I've had so far. Crunchy beans, fresh tomatoes, and perfectly tart dressing. 
Awesome Royal Pad Thai. I always order the vegetarian. Thin rice noodles with yummy tamarind sauce, roasted peanuts, and crunchy al-dente veggies. Be warned: it's not spicy. I always ask for chillies on the side. The crepe is also great, but does not travel well. It went soggy on the way to my place. 
The Pumpkin soup is a little sweet and bland for my liking. BUT the one note sweetness is easily remedied with some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice.
The thai spicy noodle is far too soupy..will not be ordering that again.
The few times I've asked for them to put a little bit more heat in my dishes it was like BAM! Wayyy too much spice, even for myself. It scalded my throat all the way down. It would be great if there was more of a consistent balance in the food between too mild and too spicy.

Overall, Thai To Go is fantastic if you order the right dishes. I recommend sitting down at their cute new licensed dining room and grabbing a beer with your Pad Phed."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic thai food?  Then stay clear!

Ketchup and Sugar are plentiful here.  Who needs peanut sauces and spices, anyways?"}
{"text":"I think this place is too unremarkable when there are far superior options out there, even in the area. Toronto has some great Thai places, this place is certainly not great. I can make better Thai then this at home, so why bother? Service is definitely a minus, one of the worst for a Thai restaurant.

I don't plan to eat from here again."}
{"text":"ever since the ownership changed,this place has been doomed by mediocre cooking and flaky management...thai teenagers with zero food service experience do not make good waiters,no matter how much they smile..."}
{"text":"Today was the second time in a month that I tried to order take out and not only did my call go to voicemail - with no return call, but today the mailbox was full. 
Bad business practice.
Fortunately Toronto has many great Thai places - Coco Rice and Sukho Thai being 2 of my favs and they always pick up the phone. I suppose they've invested in enough staff to make that happen - so I will support their good customer service with my $$$."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the food was very good both times. Great noodle dishes with rich flavours. Fresh ingredients. Service was friendly and eager to please. Take out service was also quite fast."}
{"text":"Charming decore. Delicious food. Friendly staff. We'll certainly become repeat customers."}
{"text":"one note taste, unfortunately didn't taste like Thai food. It is more like upscale Mancho Wok. A simple stir fries with rice costs 11.99, and it was very salty. I rather go to the close by Chinatown, more flavor and way cheaper. Stay away from here."}
