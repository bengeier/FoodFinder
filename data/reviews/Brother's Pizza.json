{"text":"Very friendly staff. The pepperoni pizza we had was good. Not great. It is a great place for bigger parties of eaters and young ones. Only had the pizza but they have a big menu of sandwiches and wings. Everybody there was having fun and gobbling down the food. Had two different tv's on with two different shows and the volume was a little high making it hard to talk above."}
{"text":"Always good....pizza on point, wings always on point, my favorite neighbor hood spot."}
{"text":"Good quick pizza if you are starving, there is better pizza in the valley, but this place is a great sitdown place to eat. I eat here a lot, but I do believe that they could make better pizza if it was cooked with less grease smothered ingredients. Naked pizza that went out of business across the street was better tasting and healthier, so it is possible. These guys, nonetheless, do have a good cheap pizza for lunch. I reccomend it."}
{"text":"Ok so I don't usually post things on sites like these but this by far was the worst experience for pizza in my life. My pregnant sister was craving pizza so I decided to find one near by, Brother's Pizza.  I am not even gonna go into prices or anything. Straight to the point there we're American Cockroach, according to google they \" COCKROACHES crawl through dirty areas and then walk around our homes tracking in lots of bacteria and germs. They can contaminate food by shedding their skins. Their cast off skin and waste byproducts are allergens that can trigger allergic reactions, asthma and other illnesses, especially in children. \" -- with SAID GROSS! I had to come back to work feeling like these cockroaches are crawling over me and in my tummy."}
{"text":"Great staff and environment.
Food is great.
Very good value.
Love Brothers on game night!"}
{"text":"So glad they started doing delivery! It's a pain finding anyone who delivers in our area. Literally just finished eating our first delivery from Brothers. The girl who took my order was more than pleasant, polite and competent, the delivery arrived promptly within the time they said it would, the delivery guy was extremely friendly and smiling, food was piping hot and delicious. Overall 5 stars for great customer service (which seems to be so hard to come by these days) and good food."}
{"text":"I love brothers pizza! Everything is delicious and fresh, I love the people here they are so welcoming and funny."}
{"text":"Great Pizza much like the East Coast pizza shops. Wings were good too!"}
{"text":"Brothers Pizza does not honor coupons.  They make it look like they do but they really don't.  I ordered Pizza twice online and received an email stating how much it was and then when I got there and presented a $10 off coupon they didn't take $10 off the price I was quoted online but actually charged me more than what I was quoted online giving me a BS reason of the online system quoted me the wrong price.  Even after I showed them the email they still didn't budge on the price.  So I basically wasted my Restaurant.com Coupon there.  Pizza is good but Service is Terrible.  Not surprised we were the only people in the restaurant the way they treat people.

I completely understand not honoring the 10% off online and the $10 off coupon but it appears as a consumer that I didn't receive either tonight.  The Subtotal on the email was $21.70 before tax.  10% of that is $2.17 which brings the normal Subtotal to $23.87 plus tax which puts me at about $26.  If your not going to honor both which is fine, take $10 off my original Subtotal before the online discount and that puts my bill at about $16.  Not the $23+ I was charged tonight.  I would much rather have $10 off than $2.17.  And if there is something wrong with the online pricing to where the price is not correct for what you ordered online then get it fixed.  Don't have the customer think they owe one amount and then they get there with a coupon and get charged a totally different amount.  As a Manager myself of a Business, I feel this situation should have been handled much differently tonight in order to keep a customer.  They obviously did not want to keep me as a customer the way I was treated tonight."}
{"text":"I came in here today and I was stunned at how much it has changed. The food is always so amazing and the staff is always so welcoming and helpful. I do believe that in the restaurant industry there are two places that you need to excel in to be successful, and those areas are your product itself and costumer  service. Brothers pizza excels in both areas and I would recommend this place all around as great! I will be coming in a lot more often now that it is under new management and have completely 180'ed the service and quality."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza and wing place ever. I have been going here over 14 years. Drive all the way from south Phoenix two to three times a month for my pizza fix. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was made from icebergs lettuce, unflavored  cheese  and meat. The spaghetti  with meat sauce was boring. The fried zucchini tasted like baloney, very strange. The garlic  bread  was half toasted.  The upside was we didn't get sick eating there."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza - fast delivery - don't ask for dipping sauce

I don't know if they're offended if you ask for ranch, but twice now I specified the amount I wanted (pizza and ranch is like peanut butter and jelly to me). The last time they delivered they said they'd turn around and give us the rest we asked for and then never came. Once again this time they didn't deliver on what I requested. I called back to let them know and they said sorry, they couldn't hear me (shouldn't mean that they just skip it) and I did repeat the amount several times. After the fact I was in mid conversation explaining what happened when they hung up on me. I called back immediately and the kid who answered transferred me to someone else. I very much got the idea that I was bothering and annoying them by requesting what I had ordered so I said never mind. Unlikely I'll order again though I will miss the pizza.

If all you're looking for is pizza then this is the place. Otherwise it doesn't seem like they have time for you."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find another pizza place that I love like the one from my old neighborhood and I love this place!!! I love the people they are always so nice!! The food is always great! It doesn't matter what we order it's ALWAYS good!! If you haven't been here I definitely recommend it! Don't ever change Brothers!!"}
{"text":"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said \"Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu.\"  I said, \"but it's on the internet with your address/web page\"  and she said, \"yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu\"  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces \"out-of-the-freezer-bag\" deep fried. 
 
 I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.  

A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers."}
{"text":"I love brothers! They have the best pizza and wings in town! Great costumer service and reasonable prices! Love their specials! If youre looking for good New York pizza style, must try them!"}
{"text":"Fast, clean , excellent customer service,  great pizza and affordable.  We visited the Avondale location"}
{"text":"I went with a large group on Super Bowl Sunday! It was nice because most of their business were take out orders and there was space to accommodate our large party. 

The family and employees were all busy, but stopped to give us a friendly greeting. We were told up front that because of the high take out orders for the super bowl the wait might be a little longer than usual. I appreciated that honesty and it worked well for our group as it gave us time to share drinks and chat. The wait also wasn't bad at all. Even with all of the business in the kitchen, I felt our orders all came out in a reasonable time.

We ordered the large pepperoni pizza, large vegetarian pizza, large amazing everything on it pizza, buffalo wings and bbq wings. ALL of the pizzas were amazing. The crust great and the toppings all left you feeling satisfied with every bite. As a meat lover, I was really surprised at how popular the vegetarian pizza was. It was the first tray to disappear! 

The cheesecake desserts were top notch!! The chocolate moose cheesecake and regular cheesecake was devoured, needless to say. 

I'd go again and get take out with me on the road if I was traveling. Perfect pairing with coffee!"}
{"text":"Greasy pizza and shitty attitudes. I can't tell if they are going for an atmosphere or if the owner really is that clueless. Of the 30 tables most of them hadn't been cleared after the last rush. A couple of us bussed our own tables for a place to sit.  Not impressed with the staff and the food was unremarkable. Overall I would rate this place as meh."}
{"text":"What a great pizzeria!  The pizza was flavorful and the wings were well coated and juicy.  The employees were friendly and knew the product - which is always helpful.  Today marked the first of what will be many visits.  Kudos to everyone that works there!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Pizza and wings are the best this side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place.
The service is very friendly and familiar.
Food is great.
Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yeah so the fam and I were looking for a new pizza place and we came upon Brothers Pizza....ummm yeah Im not gonna beat around the bush on this one, DO NOT go here it was the worst pizza ive EVER had in my life, Im not even sure that what I was eating was pizza because it sure didnt taste like it,the wings were just ok but the mild \"sauce\" was more like mild oil! As soon as the hubby brought the pizza out to the car I knew there was something wrong because it smelled really wierd..not like pizza smells,The cheese is horrible im not sure if it is cheese or what it was but it didnt taste like cheese and it was like lumpy, gross! we asked for 1/4 peperoni because the hubby doesnt eat pork and I do so I always get a few pieces with peperoni on it,but they gave us 1/2 peperoni so my hubby couldnt even eat that much.....not that he wanted to anyways! I will never go back here again and I dont know why any of these other people gave good reviews for this place, they eirther have never had pizza before in their lives or they are on crack....take your pick!"}
{"text":"I'm from New Haven, that's where New Yorkers come to,  to learn how to make pizza. This guy makes a great pie."}
{"text":"Foodwise, the pizza is pretty good and the parmigiana are above average. I've been there three or four times and the place was filthy every time. Seriously, the place looks like Beirut. The other constant is how rude everyone is. I don't think I've dealt with the same person twice, but their attitude is always the same: \"why are you bothering me with your patronage?\" I'm starting to wonder that myself."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place and it actually looks rather uninviting, but the pizza is excellent -- some of the best New York-style pizza I've had in the Valley. Their wings are also great, accompanied by a healthy dose of sauce and crispy instead of fatty.

The employees aren't particularly friendly or welcoming, but the place definitely has a vibe similar to a pizza joint I went to in Manhattan: they don't mess around, and that applies to the food.

Not a very cheap place, considering how many pizza places have carry-out, single-topping pizzas for $5 these days, but the quality is significantly better.

Probably a great place to chill with some friends and watch some hoops."}
{"text":"Easily one of my go-to restaurants nearby! I come here on Fridays for my family of boys and stick with the large pizza and 20 wings special... despite it being busy the employees always make it a point to greet me as soon as I come to the counter. The pizza is great!! Awesome wings and I always come in and get a smile. During the week they have $2.00 mugs of beer... can you believe that?!?! Have to try more of their pastas, i tried the chicken parmesan once and it was to die for and at a great price. :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings special is the bomb. Have been going here for over 7yrs. Wings made the way I like extra crispy and sloppy. Staff is always on point."}
{"text":"Have been going to Brothers for years. The pizza is very good, and the wings are my favorite. Mostly do their delivery, but have ate in the store. The place was clean, but well worn. Beer is cold and cheap. 
I recommend the pizza and wings special,  1 large 1 item pizza and 20 wings, $22! Oh, and ask for the wings crispy!"}
{"text":"The food is great and very reasonably priced. The only reason I don't give them 5 star is because table service is spotty. You have to order at the counter and sometimes they will bring your food to the table and sometimes they call you to pick up your order from the counter. The restaurant is clean and workers are polite."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza. Nice friendly staff. Great place o have been going here and their other location in avondale for 15 years. My favorite pizza place by FAR"}
{"text":"The food is okay but whatever you do, don't think you're getting a deal by getting the groupon. They do not let you use it towards any specials or other coupons so you end up spending more money in the end. Nice scam guys. We used to go there once or twice a month but will not be returning again. Read the other reviews from other people having the same problem here. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, go down the street to Stevie's, Grazzianos, or Streets of NY. It is NOT stated on the groupon that you can not use it towards any specials or promotions. Nice try. I have uploaded a photo of the groupon for all to see."}
{"text":"The food can be really good but it also seems to be very inconsistent. We've even had to send it back a couple times for being completely overdone. Same thing with the wings, sometimes they're incredibly small with very little meat. When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's terrible."}
{"text":"Wings are the tiniest I have ever seen! They should  be embarrassed to even sell them!  I called  after super bowl as we went here all the time and at that time I was shocked as were the friends we brought with us for pizza and wings.  I called owners and was told it was just because of the vendors running out of the bigger ones due to the demand.  Well they are still that small, so very disappointed to say the least.  Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I should not have to argue to use a restaurant.com gift card, and they tried to change the price instead of taking the 10$ off saying i could not use it on specials. I understand that but i also purchased other pizzas at full price, so it should apply to the full price pizzas. Along with that i arrived 5 mins before the pick up time, and live 5 mins away. When i got home pizza and wings where cold. Would not visit again food is overpriced, and employee has no customer service skills."}
{"text":"Great wings! Pizza is good, can be alitte flimsy in the middle but other that, good establishment. Also have good specials and great customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here whenever were craving pizza and wings. They seriously have the best wings I think. Whenever we dine in the service is always great!!"}
{"text":"great local business, the food is always great.  have been coming here over 15 years.  if you are looking for a full service restaurant, this is not that, but i think that should be obvious when you walk in the door.  you order at the counter and sometimes you get your food at the counter and sometimes they have a waitress or two and they will give you a number and bring your food to you.  they have great specials and prices are very reasonable.  4 or 5 big tv's that usually have a game on.  this place is not trendy, nor has it ever had any sort of remodel since we have been coming....but that is part of the charm as far as we are concerned.  with awesome food and prices that haven't budged up too much over the years, we are good with it.  our kids especially love this place and the owner has come over to greet us several different times to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"Yep, just meh. The pizza is pretty big, but bigger is not always better my friends. Pizza had no flavor-I felt like I put peppers, salt, and parm on this poor piece of pizza but nothing really made it much better. Crust was also just a boring crust. 

Service was good-people were nice. The place was clean-had a few T.Vs around with sports and shows. Not busy at all on a Wednesday night-but not many places really are. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The wings are amazing, the pizza is out if this world New York style big slices with lots of cheese! They have a wide selection of pastas salads and subs. Great for family outings a quiet night with friends or to bring a whole sports team. The brothers staff is friendly helpful and thoughtful. Has great beer prices and pizza wing combos. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, fresh veggies, thin crust... Delicious! they delivered it within 30 minutes...as a restaurant owner myself in the west valley the menu and ordering was simple. Great job! Thanks."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood pizza place!  Cozy environment for good pizza, wings and your favorite beverage.  Quite a few items on the menu to choose from other than pizza and wings  Service was friendly, we will be back to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"Our first time at a Brother's Pizza and our last. If you dine in, please don't expect good service or service at all. Pizza is extremely greasy, very disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  We really wanted this to be good pizza but it was tasteless and flavorless. The crust was the best part. Also ordered an antipasta salad. Again, disappointed. Tons of iceberg chunks, very little leafy parts and no romaine or spinach blend and the topping seemed like nothing but lunch meat."}
{"text":"The people are awesome!  The service is great. Noah and Sheena you are the best.  I will be be back. That is a warning.  Lol!"}
{"text":"I am so mad at myself.  We have lived her almost 6 years and this place is very nearby....never noticed it.  The Pizza was fantastic!  The dough is amazing.  I ate the crust and I never do.  The whole family loved it!"}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers,
My boyfriend introduced me to this little pizza shop near his neighborhood. It is so nice and surprisingly very good! I love coming here instead of other expensive places that boast they are good pizza! I love how a medium is giant! And a large is even more giant! I love their fried pickles so delicious! I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Well im new to the area so delivery is also my only option... I yelped for delivery in my area n found this place... I can say i placed the online order thru yelp and im satisfied it came fairly quick within 30-40 mins, i ordered xtra large pepp n it only cost 16$ tipped the delivery guy 5..... Took a bite n pizza is decent , im not complaining!"}
{"text":"The steak special and Chicken Parmesan are our favorites. Wings and beer compliment the experience. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, the wings are ok really cooked. I preff to go in and eat the pizza in the restaurant it's more enjoyable. The staff should smile and look more happy when there working."}
{"text":"Their pizza is awesome. Some of the best I've had.  I don't live in Phoenix anymore, but I come here every time I visit."}
{"text":"We went to Brothers because we heard the place was great... Not so much. Ordered wings and the Brothers special pizza.  The wings were drowning in sauce but tasted good. They made the decision to replace the green peppers with an over abundance of red peppers without asking us. Since I don't care for sweet red one on my pizza , it was awful.   Also the menu stated that it has extra cheese, more true it looked like less cheese and hardly any meats just a ton of red peppers and onions. Won't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza."}
{"text":"3 stars-o.k.  It use to be better.  It has gotten more expensive and the quality of pizza has gone down.  Also noticed on my last visit it isn't as clean or nice as it use to be.  The booth we were in had paint peeling-very unattractive.  I would go again but only with a coupon and would choose my eating area carefully.  Also, sometimes the owners (I think might be workers) kids are there.  They are loud and not well behaved."}
{"text":"Great local place for pizza, wings, sandwiches. Everyone is always very friendly and the atmosphere is a cool neighborhood pizza joint. Always enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"mixed reviews in our house. i was not a fan but my mother in law from new york loved it."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, the food was lousy. The combo pizza barely had any toppings. The fried chicken wings and fried zucchini were super dark color due to the cooking oil was old and overly used. Especially the zucchini was overly fried and hard like stone. I called and talked to a manager but my complaint was not resolved. For such bad food quality I will never return....."}
{"text":"Lasagna came with a decent sized garlic bread, & both are better than other places i've tried."}
{"text":"Grease, grease and more grease on our pizza. Wings were okay nothing to write home about. Besides the food being less than editable without getting a stomachache. The booths were ripped and old and we saw a cart where all these dishes were being stacked. You have to walk by it to use the restrooms. Once you get into the restrooms we see a cockroach and turn around and head to the car. One time is enough for me"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for lunch before a spring training baseball game. It was clean and the service was fast. The bench seating was nice for our group. I ordered the 2 cheese slice special, $6 and came with a large tea. The crust was thin, folded nicely. I enjoyed the cheese ratio, gooey! I'd definitely stop by this place if I was out at Camelback Ranch again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings the staff is super friendly too! Definitely a place you need to try."}
{"text":"Gosh why must the pizza be so expensive? I think brothers pizza is so good. Reminds me of the pizza I've had in new york. Very good and the brick oven taste is great. But it is $20 for just a plain cheese, pass."}
{"text":"Pizza for delivery has been late every time I ordered by at least 30 min and cold when it arrives. The price is a little high for mediocre cold late pizza. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'd heard this place was good. So when I saw a Groupon for it, I purchased it and decided to give it a try on a Sunday afternoon. I called them and problem 1 was they said they currently have no way to do deliveries. Even though website and Groupon say DELIVERY. Number 2 issue was they do not accept groupons for delivery. The terms of the Groupon did not say that. I further inquired and mentioned that's not stated and they very rudely said that was too bad and then HUNG UP ON ME!!! I tried calling back and they did not answer. Terrible customer service. Definitely will not be trying this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. I'm from out of town. Ordered a pizza, wings, and pasta. Everything was delicious. Garlic bread was the topping. Yum. Awesome service. When I was paying wasn't aware they had a special from what I had ordered. Owner gave me the special pizza and wing special. Saved me some $$."}
{"text":"Pizza and the wings are great here. My daughter likes the spaghetti and meat balls too."}
{"text":"I have been going to brothers pizza since i was 6 years and i have never been disappointed in the pizza or wings"}
{"text":"Had an issue with a salad we ordered. Was supposed to have meat on it but when hubby got home there was no meat. Called the restaurant and she acted like she didn't believe me. Said to bring it back for another salad. Took it back and got another one but wouldn't give us a credit for our trouble. Didn't even apologize. The salad was good but would have been better with homemade dressing. My husband's lasagna was ok. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"We had a Bogo coupon from Entertainment Book and decided to try this place for the first time.  We knew what we wanted from looking at the menu online.  We went straight from work and arrived about 5:30 p.m.  Only one table had people at it, and they were already eating.  We went to the counter and ordered a small order of fried zucchini as an appetizer, eggplant Parmesan  and Chicken Parmesan.  The waitress brought out our drinks and said she would bring our food when ready.  Then the waiting for the zucchini began.  The waitress had a list of chores on a board in the back and was doing those and then checking them off.  Frying up some zucchini and serving it should take 5 minutes.  After 15 minutes, more people started showing up and ordering food.  After 20 minutes, I went up to the front counter and asked, \"Is our zucchini ready?\"  The man doing the cooking said, \"It's coming with the salads and garlic bread.\"  All the while, he kept calling the name of the waitress, but she just kept on with her list of chores.  Finally, he got her attention and asked her to make the salads and garlic bread.  At 6 p.m., half an hour after we ordered an appetizer, she served us the salad and bread.  Where is the zucchini? my husband asked.  It is coming right now, she said, and she went and got it.  It was not hot to the touch.  It was still hot on the inside, but not piping hot.  The bread was warm.  Of course, while we were still eating the salad and zucchini, about five minutes later, the entrees were served.  Watch the plate, it's hot, the waitress said.  The fact that she did not have a pot holder in her hand should have been a clue.  The entrees were both cold.  So we got the entrees to go.  The entrees had obviously been sitting out, waiting for someone to drop the zucchini and splash some garlic butter on some bread.  Bad, bad service.  Only saving grace was flavor of the food, which was decent.  But we will never go back there."}
{"text":"Talk about a place NON CUSTOMER focused! Arrived at 12 noon after seeing board out front announcing luncheon special of 2 slices and drink for 4.95...Well, not s pizza slice available! Had to wait 15 minutes! Do not expect much if you decide to come here..."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite place for Italian food! We tried this place out last week because we found them on Restaurant.com. Last week we had the best calzone since we moved here to AZ. Today great sausage parm sub lunch special. The restaurant is nothing fancy but it is clean and the food is delicious....that is what matters to me!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, do not order boneless wings here Bc they look like meatballs and taste like rubber !!!!"}
{"text":"Brothers pizza, what a mess. Sat down and got our order taken, drinks came fast. However, our onion rings sat on the counter for a few minutes. Pizza came fresh and hot. We didn't get parmesan cheese when we asked twice, the couple in the booth next to us gave us theirs.The restroom was dirty, and the flusher was broken on the toilet. An employee got pills out of her purse on the front counter, Generally slow service for a little amount of customers. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Warning to anyone who wants to use entertainment coupon (buy one entree, get one entree).  Called in order for 2 calzones.  Presented the coupon upon arrival and he said it wasn't good for calzones, because they weren't an entree.  WHAT! I had checked their website before ordering and there is no listing of ENTREES at all.  I told him I wasn't going to buy them and left.  I bet he was so happy, because he probably got to eat them himself.  I can hear him telling his boss all about it with his spin on the story.  So anyway we went back east a couple of blocks on Indian School and ate with another entertainment coupon at Tortas Paquime.  Made up for not getting any calzones.  Go to Tortas if you want some juicy Rib Eye Tacos."}
{"text":"The pizza and boneless wings are very good. I like the pizza when it's very hot before the oil on top sets. You can actually fold the slice down the center just like NY pizza! It is not cardboard pizza. The pizza sauce is seasoned just right. The only thing I have a problem with is that the pizza is not always baked enough. Sometimes the middle is soggy. Also, the dinner salad is good but pricey. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Overall I think it's a very good place on this side of town to get pizza."}
{"text":"Well definitely one of the better meatball sandwiches I've had in a long time cute little bar great atmosphere awesome prices friendly help clean cheery awesome place to have a good time bring your appetite best pizza in town or at least on this side of town don't forget their specials they have for football 6 domestic beers for 12 bucks hard to bet"}
{"text":"They have messed up our online order twice now,and when we drove back to have the order fixed,they were very rude.It shouldn't be that hard to switch an order around.To loose a good customer over an order of mushrooms is sad"}
{"text":"Don't bother, wings  and pizza bla, like Granda pizza, went there because we were told they had Monday night football, not,all TVs were offline had no sports on at all. We should of left then, prices suck too, suggest you skip this place!!!"}
{"text":"I decide to order pizza tonight from here for the first time bc it had good reviews. I am from NY and enjoy a good pizza but unfortunately I didn't get to try the food bc I didn't order from them. The first girl was nice but unfortunately couldn't add and 1 large pizza w/ 3 toppings and 40  wigs was $57. so then another girl got on and said sorry that's  not right so I said okay how much do I owe you. As she was talking I heard a man yelling at her than he gets on the phone and said \"you been on the phone for 30 min what can I get you mam! I started to talk and he interrupted me and said\" Mam Mam, what do you want?!\"  So I said \"Nothing, you're  Rude, I want nothing\" and hung up. That was horrible service, I have never experienced such rudeness when ordering food n I'm from NY!"}
{"text":"I am a fan. Great wings, good prices, and no fuss atmosphere. $3.00 Kilt Lifter helps too."}
{"text":"We get the pizza and wings all the time! The wings are delish: the hot wing sauce is yum! Can't go wrong here, had great service every time I called and ordered or got delivered."}
{"text":"Entirely overpriced for the quality you get. You know the pizza places that offer by-the-slice? Doesn't taste gross, but you know it's been sitting awhile. That's what this tastes like. But at least those places are cheap! $30 for a medium 1 topping pizza and an appetizer...not worth it"}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in the area and the staff is very friendly. They have a lot of options to choose from as well."}
{"text":"It's really hit or miss with this one. I got the best wings and pizza of my life here and then I've also had really tiny little wings like the smallest kind I've ever seen in my life and greasy floppy pizza. It's a little on the pricey side so I expect the food to be bomb every single time but seriously it's hit or miss. They sell beer if you go in there to eat they have a lot of options pastas and salads and everything you could want I've only had the pizza and wings and it's literally a three or a 10"}
{"text":"My rating is more for the staff employees than the food.    The Pizza, Antipasta, and Garlic Bread are wonderful.  For the food, I would say it's a great take out and even a dine in.  The place is casually decorated, kind of a sports theme, and pizza parlor.

The cashier helping the guests last night was wonderful, courteous, and very pleasant.  The rest of the staff looked like the grumpiest, family feuding, and couldn't smile if their life depended on it bunch.

In fact, there was one female working behind the counter wearing a white tshirt handling the salads and garlic bread, and she was the bitchiest worker there.  Everything she stated was a yell and a complain it seemed like.

They have a small bar, but my first impression was a little disappointed.  There was one patron there who made several failed attempts to joke with any worker passing by but all seemed to ignore him.

Again this is just my first impression..."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the valley. Ordered the Brothers Special Sicilian. It was so good I went back the following week. Both times I was there, the place was busy both dine in and take out. Staff was very friendly. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wings were a bit dry this time but normally spot on.

Their plates are really delicious, but I'm not sold on the calzones and have not tried the pizzas. 

Definitely recommend lasagna and manicotti."}
{"text":"Brother's Pizza has been there for as long as I can remember.. 

Going back to my high school days where that was a great after school hangout. I love this pizzeria! It's a pizzeria with such a strong family and community feel. It has never changed since the day I first set foot in it almost a decade ago. 

They offer a great selection of pizza, beer, wings ect. Everything is ran like a family business, they truly care about their clientele. They love their customers so much you can just feel it! The order taker and staff is always so nice and welcoming.

They make everything the old style and it shows in their pizza! Thick layers of cheese and toppings the stretches as you take bites of this cheesy goodness! Brother's Pizza is delicious, that's why it's still standing on the lonely far westside after so many years :) A strong thread of regulars speak louder than reviews :)"}
{"text":"The problem with this place is that they are the only pizza place around and they know it. Food is fair to midland... salad was not the freshest... wings were alright... and the cheese from the pizza made it greasy. I just out that greasy pizza is caused by cheap cheese. But like I said around here it's them or nothing so suck it up buttercup."}
{"text":"We love this place.  When we come to visit our son who lives nearby we always take our grandkids here.  The pizza, wings and salad never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great pizza on the west size with an awesome medium buffalo wings sauce for the side 
Yummy"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because the pizza is amazing but they can be pretty hit and miss with everything else depending on how busy they are! The wings are really good but again it all depends on when you're ordering...it seems Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest so order at your own risk! This place was my go to pizza place when I lived in Phoenix and always order from here when I go back!!! Everyone is super friendly and the food is great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience, the staff were amazing. I'm very picky about my pizza and my marinara sauce. The pizza has a great crust, super sauce and fresh toppings. The spaghetti was awesome, noodles cooked perfectly, sauce was tangy with a little garlic. I would definitely try this local pizza restaurant out. B-)"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wing special.  Can't get enough of that cheezy goodness.  The wings?  Done just right.  

Had a chicken parm once; not bad.  Not overly memorable, but jot bad."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are always good. I always order my pizza with extra sauce. Comes out perfect every time."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the baked ziti and fried zucchini there's so much food that we walked out of here stuffed it was delicious couldn't leave a drop on the plate. bread oh my God the bread is good. The service truly surprise me it was great they were very attentive."}
{"text":"Another check in.... tonight I got the chicken parm dinner.... Mmmmm! Mmmm!!

Nice pieces of white meat breaded cutlets, very generous serving... DELICIOUS!!

Customer service cannot be beat!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT pizza!!!! I always go for lunch for the house slices.. I also always ask them to put the sauce on top of the slices as well. Amazing sauce and really awesome pizza!! This is one of my most frequently visited pizza places!"}
{"text":"Nick and his family own Brothers pizza and they've been there for 8 years.  It's a great restaurant that offers much more than pizza.  The friendly employees are great and while not all of them know me by name, when I call with our order, which is usually the same and give them my name, the all recognize me.  And they all recognize me when I walk in.  I'm not quite Norm from Cheers but it's a close second.

The pizza is great and the Sicilian is awesome.  We looked for a long time for a great pizza place and found it at brothers.  If you are looking to try something new, be sure to give them a try.  They are at the corner of 67th Ave and Happy Valley Road, just down the plaza from Frys and Subway.

You won't go away hungry."}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday afternoon and we were starving for some good pizza.  We read the good reviews for Brothers and we thought this would be a great Groupon to buy.  The Groupon was for $20 worth of food at the 67th Ave location.  

The place was a little restaurant in a strip mall and the menu is New York style items.  There were not that many people eating, but the place did appear to be clean.  We went up to the counter and told the cashier we had a Groupon and he said we could use it on anything in the menu, including the lunch specials.  The lunch specials looked like a good deal, 2 slices of pizza with a drink for $5.  We ordered 2 of those, one cheese and one sausage.  The other special was 5 wings, slice of pizza and a drink $7.25.  We asked the cashier if we could get any pizza slice and he said \"yes,\" but \"just, not the buffalo chicken pizza.\". We asked him if we could get boneless chicken instead of wings and he said \"sure.\". We ordered the Brother's pizza slice and parmesan garlic boneless wings.  The cashier put the hand written order in with the cook.  The cashier came back to ring up the order and he told me it would be $33.80.  I said \" what!\". The total should have been $25 before taxes and he said \"well, it must be for the specialty pizza slice and the boneless wings.\". I looked at him like he was joking, but he wasn't.  I did not want to make a big deal about it, since he already put the order in.  I asked him for a receipt and he said he can only give me a copy of my credit card charge...i guess they can up charge you for whatever they want, since there is no detailed receipt, even if they said things were included.

I waited to get the food before talking with the manager.  The manager happened to be the cook and I explained to him the cashier told us the things that we wanted were included in the lunch special.  He simply said we were charged correctly and there is nothing he can do.  Wow, I sure hope the lack of customer service isn't representative of how it is in New York.

The wings were extremely dry, but the boneless was even worse.  The cheese and sausage pizza slices were very greasy, but the Brother's slice was decent.  The pizza slices were very large.
  
This is one of the worst dinning experiences that I have ever had :(  The staff had the nerve to lie to my face and argue with me when I was talking with the manager.  In the end, the manager didn't care and couldn't even give me a breakdown of the extra charges.

You can try the other location for maybe better customer service, but for me, Pappa John's would have been a better deal.

Staying home on this Groupon!"}
{"text":"This place isn't anything fancy but I love the cozy, small town pizza joint feel of the place.  And the smell when you first walk in is amazing!  They have a small bar, TVs, and lots of cozy booths.  I'm pretty picky about my pizza and theirs doesn't really do it for me but they have tons of other stuff to choose from. Last night I had a calzone that was literally the size of my head and DAMN was that good. Mmmm....ricotta. My guy loves the hoagie here as well. Great service and they have a $5 dollar off Yelp check in deal, too!"}
{"text":"I used to work there and quit because there so unsanitary they smoke while prepping the kitchen the mix fresh lettuce with gross older lettuce to save money this place may make you sick avoid the lettuce and cheese.  Wings are okay they tend to over cook them."}
{"text":"The best way to describes brothers pizza is \"Meh\"

Wings are decent, fairly priced and better tasting than other places. The pizza is alright, my only gripe is that the pizza is not diabetic friendly (and  puts me in to a sugar coma after eating it). The pasta is good but not the best. Personally its ok for what it is."}
{"text":"As I'm getting frustrated watching larger orders than mine being served before. I noticed the owner struggle with a disgruntled costumer that disliked everything she had and wanted to switch orders after she was served.

The amazing composure of the owner, even when this woman went behind the counter to explain her order, was admirable. With profuse apologies I got my order, with extra side of wings which I didnt order.

The food was good, fresh and perfect on temperature, and that manager changed what could have been a banter into admiration and respect.

Keep the good work, and try to keep up with that smile you kept on today. 

Thank you"}
{"text":"This review would have gotten 5 stars but I hate red peppers and it didn't specify that both red and green peppers came in the pizza. Next time we are trying the Sicilian crust! Hopefully, they send the same hot delivery guy!! BONUS! I look forward to trying other things from the menu. They were fast and very nice. I look forward to doing business with them again!!"}
{"text":"These guys turn out consistently very good quality pizza and other food.  The only thing keeping it from five stars is sometimes the service is much slower than other times.  But because the quality is good and the price is right, we come back very regularly.

Their wings are basic hot wings, but they are good.  We've had several of the pasta dishes and they are all good, particularly the manicotti.  Unfortunately that dish is consistently slower to come out of the kitchen than everything else, which means my wife is usually getting it just as I'm finishing my food."}
{"text":"Personally I think they are great, good pie, friendly staff, always cooked as it was ordered..."}
{"text":"Wow! The crust is awesome. The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. And the pizza and jalapeño poppers are killer! I got the lunch specials 2 slices of cheese pizza with a 16oz drink for $4.55 for me and the same special for my wife and we could only finish one slice. Man it was sooooooo good but I am looking at my other slice with intentions on destroying it when I have room again. I don't write a lot of reviews but I feel this place deserves it they don't have to rely on a gimmicks to be successful. Good food speaks for itself and I respect that!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza place! While we were waiting the owner came out and visited with us. He gave my daughter a piece of candy, encouraged her to get good grades in school. The staff was super friendly. The food was amazing, hot and delicious."}
{"text":"After rushing my staging company to have a house ready for a quick listing, I felt compelled to take them to diner.  So we picked Brother's Pizza, it was close and everyone thought it would be a good idea.  Probably the most impressive part of the visit was the waitress.  She took the time to make sure everyone's needs were taken care of, including my 1 year old daughter who typically eats off of my plate got her own special noodles and butter.

Surprisingly, no one really wanted pizza, instead everyone opted for pasta and I made the worst choice of all.  I picked the baked ziti, which was rather bland and boring.  I did get to sample the other dishes at the table and found the baked Lasagna was probably the best (I sensed they used sausage for the meat instead of beef).  Followed by the Manicotti, then  Fettucini Alfredo.  Next time I return, I will have to try the pizza, since that is their specialty."}
{"text":"Use to be a better pizza place..but the pizza is hardly fresh..ive actually seen them warm up an old pizza and serve it... now id rather go to barros/tailgaters/native.. better quality! Disappointing.."}
{"text":"It was just okay for me. Pizza was huge which was great for the price. I would eat there again.... But it would not make my top 10 favorites.  It has nothing that stands out to me as a wow factor.  Wings were good."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Stopped in the other day to find out the place is under new management and just WOW. I got the infamous large and 20 wings special at such a great price, not to mention the pizza and wings themselves were beyond great. The staff is so welcoming and friendly definitely gonna be our new hot spot!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in the valley (obviously) and not the best wings.  Both are ok. The prices and quality compare favorably with Palermo's (which is closer to me). My main complaint is their service. I ordered off their online menu, they didn't let me know how much it would be (maybe my mistake) but when I got their, the menu prices on their board did not match the online prices.  When I asked about the difference the lady at the counter unabashedly answered, \"oh, we know, the prices haven't been undated in four years\". Now I don't know if that's true or not but, while she was not embarrassed-I was enough for both of us. I knew there was a reason I hadn't been there in a while.  At least YELP says these prices might not be current!"}
{"text":"Great Pie

I am a big fan of quality pizza and it has been awhile since I've eaten at Brothers Pizza, so I thought it was about time to visit Brothers once again.  Brothers specializes in New York Style Pizza. Brothers offers a great variety of toppings and specialty pizzas that are well-worth checking out. 

On this visit I ordered a Large Pepperoni Pizza and 20 wings.  The pizza was piping hot, had a great doughy crust, flavorful sauce, right amount of pepperoni, and was quite delicious as were the wings.

The service at Brothers has always been prompt and friendly. Try to head there during non-peak times as I have noticed their busiest times are from about 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm but always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is good but location needs renovating, huge holes in upholstered seats. I put my jacket down over the holes for more comfort."}
{"text":"We order from Brothers 2x a week. Always Great service!!! Very friendly servers.. Pizza and wings are always on point!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and even better service. This is a great place to eat in and order for pick-up."}
{"text":"Their pizza is excellent but it is the wings that keep me coming back! Hot is my go to choice and they are just the right level - hot enough to make folks sweat and so tasty! The Hoagie special sandwich (toasted) is excellent as well, and we even ordered the 6 footer for my husband's 50th birthday. The staff is wonderful and friendly and the owner is always quick with a friendly greeting and a smile. This is our neighborhood place and we go at least once a week without fail!"}
{"text":"I'm very disheartened to have to update my review. I've been coming here, since September when I moved back to town, with no issues at all. I always order the same thing for my family - the 2 large pizzas with 40 wings deal. After taxes, it's about $58. Each time I've come, at least 10 times, I've always been able to split my wing flavors for the 40 piece wings into 4 different flavors. This customer service alone kept me coming back as I have 4 people who like very different wing flavors and heat profiles. Then today, that customer service vanished and the only thing different this time is I came in person to order instead of calling my order in. This place has amazing wings, but after the piss poor attitude I got from both girls behind the counter to split the wing flavors and only being told I can do 2 and that whoever split them into 4 flavors before was wrong and shouldn't have, you guys have blemished your record with me and I will not be back. Teach your staff customer service skills. This is not how you treat your customers who have spent $580 dollars in less than 4 months at your business. Maybe you should adopt the methodology of \"give them the pickle.\""}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza made in a HOT oven just like it should be!!  Gooey, melts cheese, delicious toppings, amazing pizza!  Tasty pasta dishes, too!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. The stuff is always friendly. Keep up the good work. The last pan pizza Hawaiian style we've got came out very thick and well done."}
{"text":"The best pizza by far. Blows out all other chain companies. Owner is very friendly and goes above to ensure you are satisfied."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings just don't like waiting so much usually takes long with the order to be ready."}
{"text":"We have ordered several times from Brothers.  Pizza is good and the 18\" pizza feeds our family with some left over.  Great dinner before our boys play football at CCV.  Recommended for all."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times. Its decent. A good place to bring the family or kids from school and get some pizza and wings. A non chain which is preferable to a place like Buffalo Wild Wings. But recently the Maricopa county health inspector found pink slime on freezers door handles. So I'm not sure if I'll make it back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Picked up and had a great overall experience. Staff was funny and super friendly! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Big Fan of their wings!!!! Ordered some takeout with some pizza and wings and really enjoyed it. Their hot wings are top notch and the pizza was pretty good too. The only thing about the pizza for me was just the sauce. It was not bad, but was for sure something different and it kind of threw me off. Still not bad though...

They told me it would be 15-20 minutes and it was. I hate when places say its 15 -20 minutes, then you get there and its not ready. Even worse is when they say its 15-20 minutes and when you pick it up, you can tell it has been sitting a while.

They were spot on with there time, and killed it with their wings. As for the sauce, I am sure it will grow on me or I will learn to appreaciate it more because I am going back."}
{"text":"This was a mind blowing pizza. It was always what I wanted in a pizza. Lots of toppings and a good crips crunchy crust. I recommend this pizza place. I just wish there was one on the east side of town"}
{"text":"I had spaghetti and meatballs. The garlic bread was hot and delicious. The spaghetti and meat balls was a classic dish. Great flavors and the pasta was a perfect al dente. Nick was great along with the rest of the staff. Very attentive, excellent service. I will be returning to try the rest of the menu that's for sure."}
{"text":"Really GOOD Italian food!  And delivery available later in the day!  Thoroughly enjoyed the lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs, super large portions , enough for 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 20 Years and 80% of the time is the best classic pizza I ever eaten. Even better than NY"}
{"text":"We went to Brother's pizza yesterday. Barely anywhere to sit soooo many dirty tables!! This place is never really the cleanest but the food definitely makes up for it. Love their pizza and wings sooo much that it was worth overlooking."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. 
Food is good, seating was uncomfortable. 
I am a big guy and all the booths are the 20 year old fixed position style. Not loose chairs."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I liked the pizza but the wings were not good. They were extremely soggy and had no meat. We are hoping we just got a bad batch but if we go back we will just get pizza. They send out coupons in the mail which is really nice so you can get a good deal."}
{"text":"This is a place that I frequent for pizza. They're a NY style pizza joint pretty close to where I live. They usually have specials going on for pizza, wings, and soda (not pop because this right hurrr is Arizona). Staff is friendly and we've never had a service problem. Majority of the time we'll carry out and take it home, but sometimes we stay and dine there. I haven't had dessert here, but will try to indulge after I drop some more lbs. There's one other NY style pizza place that I hit up regularly in town. My kids love their pizza."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this pizza place for years and love the pizza and wings. I especially like the cannoli for dessert. They recently expanded their menu and added a liquor license. I love little hole in the wall neighborhood spots. The owner and staff are great and it is nice to walk in somewhere where they know who you are and can make friendly conversation."}
{"text":"We have ordered Brothers Pizza more than a few times and it was always good. The pizza dough was good and the wings were big and fresh. The last two time we ordered from this place the wings were very small, dried out, overlooked and the sauce was thin like water. Our pizza last night had dough a steak knife couldn't cut through easily and my fiancé and I both got gassy and sick. We are not sure if it was the pizza or the wings but we will never order here again. Management must be cutting corners and getting cheap resulting in crappy food products."}
{"text":"Place an order for pickup and was able to use my restaurant.com coupon. They were really friendly on the phone and assisting what I need to order. Got the pizza and wings home and they were very delicious. The pizza crust was spot on thin and well-cooked.  The ingredients use was fresh and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST local restaurant. 

I eat there quite often and every single time I go there, I am impressed with what I get. 

My favorites are the special calzone with garlic butter and the chicken parm dinner....but you can't go wrong with anything you get. 

The food is very reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and attentive, the restaurant has a \"local\" feel about it, and the food is fresh and delicious. 

Brother's also does event catering and we had them cater our wedding and make some upscale food that is not on the menu. It was excellent, affordable, and easy. We felt it was a much better option than using a traditional, outrageously expensive catering company and we weren't disappointed. 

If you find yourself in this part of town, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Brothers pizza is right around the corner from our house so we figured we would try them out. Meh... The pizza and wings smelled amazing. They weren't that good. Definitely not good enough to pay full price for. Probably wont be coming back here."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in to get some wings. The guys there were very nice and professional.  You can tell that they're hardworking men. I love this place!"}
{"text":"If I ever want pizza and wings this is my go to place. Their wings are delicious and I love dipping my pizza into their wing sauce! The service is always really nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"The wings were so tiny... I wish they were bigger. But they were flavorful. The pizza there is delicious just wish the slices were bigger. Maybe it's the NYC in me.. but personal slices should be huge. Other than they tiny portions... the prices aren't bad and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I've never been to NY and I don't know what NY pizza's like but we stopped by yesterday to use a Groupon I purchased months ago and the pizza itself wasn't all that great. It was big, though. We got a large pizza with pepperoni and green pepper but to me it just tasted like melted cheese and tomato sauce and the pepperoni was dripping all over. The crust's SO thin, it doesn't hold anything. I can't imagine what's like to get the Brother's Special! There was sooo much sodium on that thing, I was drinking water non stop all day.

The staff was nice, though. And they have beer for $1.50. Their lunch special's a good deal too.

Overall though, I don't think we'll go back for pizza. Maybe we can try their subs or one of their hot plates but the pizza itself... I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The pizza taste great but the price is out of control!  I bought three medium pizzas and it cost me over $60 dollars! They must sprinkler gold into there cheese. I just can't pay that kind of money for pizza. The three pizzas were pepperoni, BBQ chicken, and then mushrooms and ricotta on the other."}
{"text":"Best wings I have had in a long time. large portions of chicken and the sauce is awesome. Pizza is excellent as well. the crust is crispy and not runny. Feeding a family of 5 is tough and places charge an arm and a leg...but Brothers is excellent for the price. Will continue to order from them often."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the pies at Brother's! The key to any great establishment is consistency and that's exactly what they have! It doesn't matter if come one year or two days it will always be the same great tasting pizza you're craving. Love the 2 slice lunch deal. They know they're recipe and got it down."}
{"text":"The entire staff is friendly and polite. The Manger is on top of everything. Good food too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Customer service can sometimes be horrible. A lot of young girls working so I try not to get too agitated. Pizza and wings are good so makes up for the service. Lasagna is great!"}
{"text":"I've been on this strange mission lately of going around to the various local pizzerias in my neighborhood and sampling/comparing their \"by the slice\" pizzas as an alternative to my usual carry-out stops during the week. I've yet to strike gold - and haven't really struck much of anything to be perfectly honest.

For what it's trying to be, which is a pretty standard, straight-forward family pizzeria for the local neighborhood, Brother's seems to be just fine. I've visited a few times now and always order two single slices of pepperoni. I'm not sure what's a fair comparison. Barro's, maybe? If that's the case, I feel Brother's is above them.

Ingredients are fine and crust has okay flavor. I live just a few minutes from here, so by the time I get my home, my pizza is still edible. Although I've found that it usually ends up getting hard very quickly, even before finishing off the second slice. Kind of strange, but single slices have often been sitting out for God knows how long.

Anyway, although it's nothing really spectacular in comparison to what else is available, it's decent enough to the point where I see myself swinging by here on occasion for a couple of slices, or maybe even a calzone when I'm feeling the urge to live dangerously.

Check them out."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and tried brothers pizza for the first time. Had it delivered and when they told me the price over the phone, I thought it was a tad pricey compared to some other pizza places, but once I got our food, it was worth every penny. The pizza and the wings were both delicious. This will now be my pizza place."}
{"text":"It usually happens like this: I'm driving, on my way home. I call husband and ask what he wants for dinner. After several minutes of indecisive bantering back and forth, he says \"wings?\" I say \"sure, from where?\" He says \"Brothers?\" I say \"sure, call it in.\" Haven't had the pizza in quite a while, but it was alright. Obviously not fantastic, or I would remember that. And not disgusting, or I would remember that as well. They have a decent menu full of other Italian dishes and sandwiches. Not the best most awesome wings, but it's the closest and on my route home. Staff is friendly and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"If you like New York style pizza and a simple type of atmosphere, you really can't go wrong with this place. It's right next to my house so I get pizza and wings and salad on a regular basis, well it's a bit pricey, it's something I'm willing to pay for because it's so darn good"}
{"text":"We really like this non-chain pizza joint. They have a great wing and pizza special that is perfect for tailgating! The sandwiches are very good as well. I find this place to be much better that your Papa Johns, Dominoe's, Pizza Hut options"}
{"text":"Very mediocre pizza. If you find yourself stranded in the Brother's parking lot with a broken down car and there's no one to give you a ride and you're really hungry, it would be better to walk to the Circle K and get a snack to tide you over til help arrives."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, we were treated very well when we ordered from the other store in Glendale by mistake.
They gave us drinks while we waited for our order to get done.
This is now our favorite wing place of all time.
Thank you to all that work there"}
{"text":"The moment I walked in I was greeted by a very rude man whom I'm assuming was the owner. I walked in with my friend to get a pizza and after I ordered he turned to my friend and asked if it was my boyfriend to which I replied no just a friend. He then proceeded to turn to my friend and say you're lucky then. I was very taken aback as he continued to make commentary on how lucky my friend was to not be my boyfriend. I was deeply insulted. Then as I took my seat I noticed something odd in the salt shaker, at first glance I thought it was on the outside of the bottle but upon further inspection I realized there were several dead ants and another small bug mixed in with the salt. Then as I looked over I noticed a pizza crust jammed between the wall and the seat. Absolutely disgusting and I couldn't even eat my pizza in fear of it being contaminated by ants or god knows what else. Overall one of the dirtiest restaurants I've ever been in if you could even call it that. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"This the best pizza ever! It is a New Years tradition between me and my husband to order a large pepperoni and 20 wings and just snack the night away!"}
{"text":"Really good wings and pizza. The service is unfriendly and the food took a while to get to us even though we were the only ones in there at the time."}
{"text":"I know people have personal preferences regarding pizza, but I'm just not sure how this place has so many good reviews. The cardboard box had more flavor. I also found the customer service to be lacking, the gentleman that took my order was not pleasant at all. I don't really understand, if you're going to be surly with customers perhaps you should be in a different business ?"}
{"text":"Love Brother's- really good pizza-great wings and just look at that salad. Always busy- family friendly casual-good selection of beer- great service"}
{"text":"Bit pricey but it's well worth it. The pizza is the best you can get outside of New York. Heesa the owner is very friendly and makes my group feel at home.  The mild wings taste better then the hot, that's the key...MILD are the best.  Again, the pizza is outta this world.  I do have a neg hit, Tiffany the waitress is condescending rag riding beer wench.  Order what you need but don't look her in the eye, you'll turn to stone, and she'll burn your face off with looks of death.

The rest of the staff are awesome, friendly, and they know exactly what you always order.  I LOVE brodders Pete-zer!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, and wellllll....The place literally stinks like crap, and near the back by the restrooms it smells like cigarettes as well! I ordered a Large Pizza and 20 Hot wings....Pizza was seriously way to greasy like bad enough to try and blotch out the grease with napkins and I never ever do that, the cheese taste like cheap plastic cheese. The wings are not at all spicy and overly drenched in sauce, and the sauce isn't even uniquely tasting either, all it is, is Red Devil and Red Hot sauce mixed together, all in all it just wasn't the place for me, I know lots of people go here but I just can't see why."}
{"text":"Brothers has been in business for 25 years, used to dine there many years ago and recently started going back. They have the best wings, deep fried just right, not soggy, I love the BBQ wings, the subs are great too, pizza is ok, I personally dont get pizza when we dine here just a big order of wings and garlic cheese bread. The staff is always friendly to us and the Owner is one of the nicest around. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the west side, maybe the valley. Their old style recipe and cooking process makes for a wonderful pizza experience. Do not hesitate to visit when near by."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place only 4 stars because their wings are ALWAYS dry. I've never had them normal which is juicy and soft and tender. It's like a hard piece of something, I don't even know.

Pizza: tastes amazing and has that perfect crust and perfect amount of sauce. The cheese is yummy and not too gooey. 

Mushrooms: pretty damn close to the best I've had. Super close. 

The staff is nice and seem to make jokes that are not funny but really are. I like them. You should too. 


EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go tried to pick it up and they lied to me about the price as if that didn't matter this was my second bad experience with this place I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Brothers Pizza is the bomb! Everything I have ever ordered from here is outstanding. Their chicken parm is top notch. Do yourself a favor and eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best!!! Cold beer,good wings, salads and pizza are awesome!!! Staff is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Well if you like cardboard with ketchup on it with a very thin amount of cheese?on it this is your place,. Ive had frozen pizza with more flavor in it. Well i dont wanna say anthing else that will hurt this place i just hope they change their pizza reciepe."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza!!!  The wings are great too!!!  The place is spotless and the manager (Eric) has the place running like a fine-tuned machine.  Not the best area, but worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"So there I was sitting in my hotel room...starving. Though as an outsider to the city I soon realized that I don't know where to go. Opened up Yelp and also realized that I really don't want to go anywhere...delivery filter . Slowly make my way through the Yelp ADs (gotta keep the lights on) and stumble upon this gem, order online through Yelp? Surprise win. $25 delivery minimum? Challenge accepted. Medium pizza, pepperoni...AND sausage because 1 topping is for chumps. At this point I'm sitting at $13 so I double down with a 10pc of bbq boneless wings, oh did I mention they have wings? And sammiches, pasta AND dessert? Well now you know and hell yeah I got some cheese cake because I'm a fat f**k. Anyways pizza was great, lots of cheese and toppings, eating the wings for lunch tomorrow but they passed the eye test. The cheese cake was cheese cake...no surprises and I consider that a good thing. If you where on the fence go ahead an order."}
{"text":"A horrible first experience. Soggy on the bottom, bland, and a little too much cheese. The prices were a bit high too for such a terrible pizza. But from what I heard about them from others, their experiences were good, so this calls for inconsistency."}
{"text":"Good pizza and a casual atmosphere great service I'll be back"}
{"text":"Places like this show you the American dream is alive.  They made it threw the tuffest of time, barely raise price, and has a line out the door.

Their food is consistently good and fairly price. SUPPORT YOU LOCAL BUSINESS.  stop buy from chain places."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I love the pizza and the wings!!!!!!!! I go to Brothers all the time and have never been disappointed. The price is good. They have a lunch special and larger specials that can feed a family. I highly recommend you try this place. I love it and I know you will too. Best place for pizza on the West Side in my opinion ."}
{"text":"This was marginal,at best, pizza. Salad was good.. bathroom was nasty. Tables and seats tattered. But the biggest complaint.....They charged $2.00 each for a glass of water....never will set foot in this ,as I said, marginal restaurant again."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great cheese pizza! Service is great! We mistakenly went to the other brothers in town, they are not the same!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. We got a 16\" pizza, half pepperoni, half cheese and an order of fries. And there were a lot of fries! And they were battered! Nice surprise. The pizza was good and had a good amount of sauce and relatively soft crust. The clientele were not the classiest, but if they make you uneasy you could always get take out, rather than dining in. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Wonderful wings. This is always out go to pizza joint. Anytime we have friends over we always order from Brothers and it's always a hit. Thanks for always knocking it out of the park for us!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Brother's family run business for the past 10 years. They are the best pizza in The Valley! Their food is excellent and our favorite Friday Night Pizza Place!"}
{"text":"Exactly the NY style pizza taste I was craving tonight.  My only complaint was there was too much cheese/sauce so it was a little greasy and hard to eat.  Wings were good too!  Food was very hot and staff very friendly.  I called in the order for pickup and was hoping to find a menu online since we hadn't been in there but they don't have a website yet - what restaurant doens't have a website???"}
{"text":"We LOVE their wings and the wing sauce!!! As I mentioned on my first review, their wing sauce is amazing!!! I could drink it!! 

\"Wings are wings\" according to my husband who, like \"Mikey\" (remember that commercial??) will eat anything. But ... I ... KNOW the difference, and these are worthy of me taking the time to take pictures to share!! You will notice that I don't take many pictures... I took my time to take these pictures for a reason people!! These wings are outstanding!!! The wings are fresh and the meat is quality super white and meaty!!! They rate up there with some of the BEST wings I have had!!

We so enjoyed our meal tonight!! It was very relaxing and the employees/owners/family made us feel appreciated despite the fact that we used a coupon. Because we enjoyed our experience so much, we felt bad about using a coupon and we ordered sodas after having initially ordering water. 

We will be regulars for sure!! Look at the number of reviews that I have posted. I am not a \"friend\" of this business, but I will for sure be a customer often!!! By the way, the pizza is good too!!! Just look at the pictures!!!"}
{"text":"I love there pizza wings and salad good prices too I stop by on my lunch occasionally"}
{"text":"It was our first time ordering this evening.. Fast delivery..good customer service. Food was hot and good  My kids loved the pizza so we will definitely order again."}
{"text":"My brother loves their pizza every time he comes from New Mexico he has to buy some. Not mentioned the wings they are delicious! A lil greasy but its still delicious!"}
{"text":"The smell of baked bread already assured me this was going to be good. The bread is as good as it smelled and the vodka chicken penne pasta was outstanding. The jalapeño was a great touch and not to spicy. Even the dinner salad was great. Great personal service and atmosphere. I am glad I stumbled upon Brother's Pizza and will definitely make this a go to family regular."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to pizza place near my home. I usually stick to pep/mushroom but have tried everything from apps to wings. I'm a repeat customer and have enjoyed their pizza at least 1-2 times per month."}
{"text":"So me and the wife went here 2 weeks ago. While the pizza was decent, the wings were awesome. Good variety of flavors and they had a nice light crispy skin, just the way we like them. This being said, one would think a higher rating would ensue. Unfortunately not.

So, liking our first visit there, we thought this evening we would try them again. We went onto their website and saw that they have 50 wings for around $20. Not advertised as a special, just a normal item. Not a bad deal. So when my wife called to order, and the woman on the phone said that it would be close to $40. Which in theory, is a little high. My wife then said that their advertisement online showed differently. The lady said the site wasn't updated.

So with a $20 difference, you'd think an update would be in order. I'm not mad at the place, staff, or food, but if you are going to advertise something and refuse to honor the listed price then my business will go elsewhere.  I'm new to there area and looking for my new favorite places. This place almost had me. But lack of integrity, I am looking somewhere else this evening."}
{"text":"Normally very satisfied but tonight, however, my order was wrong. They did correct my order by re-making my pizza but no appology was offered. An extra 20 minute wait with a very hungry 4 yr old at home. You could have at least apologized and offer a drink while I waited."}
{"text":"We used to come here for the pizza & wings, but they recently expanded their menu and it sounded worth checking out. I have to say, it was quite the value! I had veal parmagean - I played it safe knowing I like the tomato sauce on their pizza. My dining partner had the chicken Francaise. Both meals came with a house salad, pasta, and garlic bread. For $11 & $12 each - there was plenty of food! The spaghetti was cooked al dente, and the meats were tender and tasty. 

The prize of this place is their cannoli (piped to order) and their cannoli calzone. Insanely delicious!!! Don't skip dessert. For any reason!

Only drawback was service was a bit patchy. Lots of takeout orders, and the one runner seemed overwhelmed. They could use a busser to handle drink refills and dirty dish pickup."}
{"text":"We ordered on a Saturday night and our delivery time was near 70 minutes. The food was room temperature, except wings were nice and hot. Our XL Pepperoni Pizza was delicious!  We would have really loved if it were a bit more fresh, however. It arrived at room temperature and we had to microwave it by the slice in order to get the cheese nice and stretchy and stringy again. Our \"Greek\" salad was disappointing and not very greek. It Consisted of iceberg lettuce, sparce sliced mushy tomatoes, black olives from a can, and a sprinkle of feta cheese but not much. Our Mango Habanero Hot Wings had a very thin sauce, but a really good flavor. Our onion rings were soggy and not crunchy at all. The New York Cheese Cake was tasty but a bit dry. Overall we give our experience with Brother's Pizza 3 stars, and with their delivery minimum being $50, we will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered online and the wings were extremely burnt. Called the restaurant to complain and they just yelled at us."}
{"text":"The thing that sets this place apart, I think, is the family atmosphere. The employees are nice, and make it an enjoyable place to eat."}
{"text":"\"The perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m.\"  - Charles Pierce

One fateful night after a long grueling ten-hour shift, the ladies who work next door decided that we were going to grab some pizza and wings and complain relentlessly about working in customer service.  Pizza, wings, and a bitch-fest?  I'm down!

Being that I'm not from the Avondale area, I never would have came across this place if it wasn't for my ladies.  We have invaded Brother's time-and-time again for years and we always get the same large pizza and wings special they have.  Wings are always lip-smacking delicious and the pizza is gigantic and oozing with cheese and grease.  The crust isn't strong enough to hold their generous amounts of toppings and is pretty flavorless by itself but we can always toss away the crust, right?  It's the kind of comfort food you need after a day of dealing with ignorant and difficult people.  One bite from this place I don't like:  the canoli.  Then again, I'm not crazy for canolis so what do I know?

Brother's isn't a glamorous establishment by any means.  It's brightly lit, there are multiple televisions with sports on, the tables and booths are strong and sturdy, and there's a semi-sporty theme going on.  It's definitely not a romantic date spot but hey, you can grab a beer and catch a game while eating some cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Went in as soon as they opened and asked for the LG pizza and 20 wing special. They told me right away that it will take 40 minutes because they had to start the oven. Which pizzeria starts the oven at the time of opening? I sat down and waited. After 20 minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings. I was told with an attitude that I didn't order the special. I clearly ordered the special when I walked in. Than I realized that they obviously didn't like me ordering the special as soon as they opened. Rather than trying to rectify the issue they were arguing with me and showed attitudes. The pizza and the wings weren't all that good either. I am from New York, there are better NY pizzas in the west valley. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Food:
1) Spaghetti and meatballs were delicious. Pasta cooked very well. Meatballs plenty (even though cut in half to seem like more, there was still a good amount of meatball). Sauce also plentiful and delicious. Wish they gave some Parmesan cheese to top the pasta with. 5/5 stars on this item.
2) Wings. Sauce good. Got a tiny ranch dressing with 10 wings which was not bad, but it is a bit small.  They were overly fried on parts of each wing such that the meat was not soft, was tough, and hard to chew and eat.  Compared to other places, 2/5 stars on wings. But still on par with, say Native New Yorker.

Pricing:
1) Ordered online.  Walked in to pay an expected amount, about $17.  Ended up paying over $22 because they had \"raised prices recently\" and they did not even try to offer the online pricing that they had not gotten updated.  Not one iota of consideration to honor those prices. 0/5 stars on customer service/attempt to retain customers.

Returning?
No.  Price games, not honoring posted prices in real time on online ordering.  It's always so empty in here, are they raising prices to make up for lost profits?  Maybe going to close this location?  Raising prices is not a good way to bring in customers, especially with non expensive food like pizza, wings, pasta."}
{"text":"Food scaps, napkins, straw wrappings on the floor - and only about an hour into the business day on Sunday.  Not busy either, staff chatting with each other, so clearly there's no rush to clean things up from the Saturday night business.  They offer slices every day at lunch yet there were none ready (or in the oven) when I arrived.  Fresh pizza is nice, but when you go to a place for a slice, a major motivating reason is the short time it takes to heat up a slice rather than make a whole new pizza.  Looks like I'll be going to Ray's, Jo-Jo's, or Grimaldis now."}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick bite because we were hungry ordered a medium size pizza by default it came with just cheese no toppings, to add toppings it is around $.75 each. Since we were price-shocked we just had two toppings - pepperoni and bacon. You can barely see the bacon  though...I didn't think the pizza tasted that great either it was way too greasy. Service was fine. The base pizza was $14-$16 alone which I thought was pricey. Needless to say we won't dine here. There are plenty of good pizza places in the valley that comes with toppings, even one."}
