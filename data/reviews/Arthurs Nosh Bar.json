{"text":"got the food to go - and was still really yummy. fries were so great and had a little kick to it. schnitzel sandwich was soooooo gooooooood wow.  i will say the omlette was super mediocre and would not recommend. much better options on the menu. looking forward to trying more next time i'm in mtl!"}
{"text":"Before heading back to the States we had to make sure we stopped into Arthur's for breakfast. So glad we did. Ordered The Scrambled with egg whites. Combination of delicious scrambled egg whites, kale, Monterey cheese, topped with mashed avocado with a side of thin crunchy grained toast. Got to try the homemade unbelievable chunky peach jam too. Coffee was delicious too. Bright,open eating area with open immaculate kitchen in the back. Friendly wait staff, great vibe. Beautiful large photos on wall of owners dad for which the place was named. Great overall experience. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"As soon as I heard that Arthurs was opening in my neighbourhood, I was overjoyed. They cite one of my favourite NYC restos as inspiration, Russ and Daughters, so I knew it was gonna be good. I went this morning for my first, of what I anticipate to be many, visits. I missed breakfast by 10 mins, which I was a bit disappointed by, but The Classic (bagel, lox, cream cheese, pickled onions, tomato sandwich) was also on the lunch menu. While I waited for my food, I watched the servers bring out food to other customers and everything looked amazing. The salads were big and fresh, the scoops (egg salad, tune, etc.) looked enticing, and the gravlax had me drooling just by looking at it. The Classic I ate brought bagels and lox to a new level. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. I also thought the prices were really reasonable."}
{"text":"Overrated  Much better places in the city for brunch Definitely not worth the line-ups"}
{"text":"Would have been higher if we didn't wait so long but the food was good. I love in the area so next time I'll just get everything to go or delivery. Don't know about friends getting seats first, hope it's not true, I just think they need help on seat organization."}
{"text":"Love the salads and the MacArthur sandwich. Definitely overpriced but the food is solid."}
{"text":"Je vais sûrement y retourner seulement à cause de la nourriture. Le service laisse un peu à désirer. Ils sont occupés comme dans plusieurs restaurants de Montréal mais on dirait que ça ne leur plaît pas de servir des clients.   En tout cas, c'est le seul point négatif, qui peut totalement gâcher un repas! Mon copain m'a dit que c'est la dernière fois qu'on y va. Mais comme j'apprécie la bonne nourriture je me suis dit qu'il fallait laisser une deuxième chance et revenir un autre jour de semaine un peu plus tôt. Je ne veux même pas imaginer bruncher ici une fds hell no  La nourriture était fraîche, simple et excellente. J'ai eu les crêpes (sans à côté) et mon copain a eu la sandwich déjeuner. Nous avons aimé nos deux assiettes.  Ce n'était pas énorme mais vu que ça goûtait vraiment bon on a accepté les portions."}
{"text":"Ok so I knew I was gonna be super critical of this place given that I hold a lot of the food they serve near and dear to my jewish heart but arthurs delivered on many levels: the staff was super warm and welcoming, the gravlax sandwich was otherworldly, the latkes were on point, the matzah ball soup was nice and salty and the matzah ball was fluffy like a nuage (thats cloud in french you dummy)   Also they brought out an amazing babka-esque desert that was to mort for but dont listen to Joanna the cinnamon was better than the chocolate."}
{"text":"GET ANYTHING WITH THEIR SALMON. Keep in mind they do not serve just fish during earlier hours (before 11). I got the latke smorgasbord ( which included salmon gravlax)  and my friend got the bagel with smoked salmon. Both were amazing and reasonably priced. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The only thing in favour of this restaurant is their aesthetically pleasing decor.  Last Sunday, my visit to Arthur's Nosh Bar was a raw experience. From waiting at the door to get in, I over heard one of waitresses complaining that she was sick and throwing up, well why the heck was she working? Gross. Food is what brings me to the restaurant but in terms of the experience, I would like to suppress the memory. Lastly, the man whom I assume is manager, was not tending to the customers bearing the wait at the door, rather he was socializing at the back with kitchen staff. You might want to re-fill that position with someone more qualified, personable and organized.   I hope Arthur's staff reads this complaint and makes the necessary adjustments to their management! I really like your restaurant but your absent management skills are worth not retuning at all. My friends and I all have all had similar experiences on different occasions. I wish you all the best Arthur's!"}
{"text":"Out initial intention when we went there is to try their poutine during the poutine week festival. While waiting for our table, I saw a customer who ordered the pancake which looked delicious, and ordered this instead. Having already eaten a poutine at another restaurant beforehand, I still finished more than half my dish. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery. Still fascinated now that I'm writing about it. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went at 10:30 waited for a good 45 minutes. The food was excellent, best schnitzel i've had and pancakes as well."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that claims to not take reservations, they sure do let a lot of their friends skip the line and preferentially seat them for breakfast. Meanwhile, everyone that has hungrily and patiently waited to give this restaurant business gets punished with a longer wait time as a result. This is not a very good look for a restaurant. This has happened both times I have gone to Arthurs, and this time will be my last visit. I will dissuade any friends, family, and colleagues from dining there.  If you don't have the integrity to abide by your own reservation rules, don't have them at all. Respect your customers, or lose them for good."}
{"text":"A breakfast/lunch/brunch joint that is only open until 3pm on most days and 4pm on afternoons. Line on weekends are always out the door. Came in on a weekday and was not disappointed.  Ordered the latke smorgasboard, which included scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, a dill and cucumber salad, a latke, and a pressed Challah roll for $15.50. The food was as near perfect as it could get. Scrambled eggs came already seasoned with black pepper on top and was perfectly fluffy. Smoked salmon came with a garnish of caviar on top, which complimented the salmon and the rest of the meal nicely. The latke was garnished with applesauce, sour cream, and chives and had a nice and crunchy exterior. The Challah was buttered then pressed and was delicious. Finally, the slightly tart and spicy cucumber salad complimented the rest of the meal nicely. Completely cleaned the plate.  Phenomenal food at a more than fair price. This place is absolutely worth the wait, and I highly recommend it. Try coming on a weekday to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"Been here twice but will not be returning based on service received second time.   The food is not worth the condescending service. As many other reviewers have already noted, they would rather seat their friends than you. They also quote \"30 minute wait\" which turns into 1h30 without an apology. It seems that they don't care about your business since there is a big enough line to fill your spot once you give up.   Food is not worth the service."}
{"text":"As comforting as it gets!  Arthur's is the talented and delicious work of a young couple who's been pouring their heart and soul into comforting and outstanding meals.  Upon walking into the restaurant, you see and smell comfort and flavorful. Which is what most Jewish meals are all about. It reminds you of the homemade dishes that either your Mom still cooks for you from time to time, or your grandparents used to cook as well.   Their menu is filled with many German/Jewish traditional dishes, while they are beautifully presented. No doubt that their kitchen staff is loaded with talent. Bravo to them! Their entire staff, is very friendly, kind and efficient. Both owners are always on the lookout to greet their regulars and see what is happening. Along with a very well trained manager, who is always on point, along with a great friendly sense of humor.   When the time arrives to decide what to order.. That's a challenge all on it's own! My suggestion would be stick to what is traditional!  Their meals hold up to the value of what they are worth, along with quality and freshness. I have been there many times. Some of the dishes I've tried were the following. Cottage cheese pancakes(Fluffy, tender and moist) with a warm drizzle of Canadian maple syrup! Amazing!  Their challah(A thick cut egg bread) french toast served with a sweet crumble and season fresh fruits is out of this world. Perfectly dipped in a delicious sweet vanilla mixture without making the French toast at all soggy. Browned in butter on both sides till a lovely golden brown crust is on both sides of the bread.   Now, let's talk about their Schnitzel sandwich. I feel this needs the absolute focus. How can you go wrong with a thick cut of veal made into a schnitzel, served in between two very thick cut pieces of challah. Along with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and lots of pickles.  Amazing! This meal deserved an absolute standing ovation.   You might be wondering, why is she in love with this place but only four stars? There is only one reason. To which I had to think twice whether it was worth only four stars.  This is why. The restaurant is small, not compact. Just small. With their well deserved success mainly due to social media and their incredibly delicious meal. The restaurant is always solid packed! Weekend brunches will require alot of your pacience in terms of the waiting time for a table. You may way anywhere between 20-45mins. Perhaps more. Depending how many of you are.  Now listen to me. You may not be a patient person, as many of us are often in a rush. The waiting time will be well worth the wait. I promise you! A promise is a promise after all.  However if you absolute hate waiting, on the weekends by at their door by 9am or anytime after 2pm.  Which by 2pm you might be crazy hungry, so just wait in line! :)   Sit back and enjoy one of the most comforting meals St. Henri has to offer you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly what Montreal needs more of. I'm a huge fan! Everything is delicious, homey and satisfying. My particular favourites are the perogies, pancakes, Cobb salad, and McArthur's sandwich. Great coffee.   Only drawback is this place is small, meaning it is usually packed on the weekends and guests are practically sitting on top of one another - so definitely expect a wait, and be in the mood to speak loudly & get cozy. However, if you live in the area, Foodora delivers from Arthur's, which is a great alternative in a pinch.   Tip: never, ever leave without ordering a babka. I'm not sure it's even on the menu - but you need it. Get both chocolate and cinnamon. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to brunch!! I wanted to try this restaurant for so long until I finally went last Sunday! I arrived around noon and waited for 1 hour to be seated but oh man it was completely worth it; Plus they kept bringing samples of food for us people-doing-the-line to try.   We ordered the eggs and salami, avotoast and pancakes. The eggs and salami and avotoast were out of this world, so good and with flavours so  well balanced. What surprised me the most was the cottage cheese pancakes , I've never eaten one in my life before that day and trust me im coming back specially for those pancakes.   I ordered some mimosas and they were gooood, perfect amount of alcohol and OJ. The service was quite fast and the ambiance super chick and fun. I completely recommend it.    This place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Challah was excellent and so was the beef bacon! Selection of the Jewish breakfast is vast and all sounds so delicious you don't know what to choose. Parking is a bit of a hassle but so so worth it. We were there as soon as they opened and the line starts to build as soon as the door opens. Food was so delicious! Great service."}
{"text":"Il y a quelques semaines, je suis allée à Arthurs Nosh Bar. J'attendais ça avec impatience. Quelle chute! C'était pas génial, c'est petit et ce n'est vraiment pas baby-friendly. Le sandwich de brunch n'était pas non plus exceptionnel, ni le service. Trop trop déçu!!"}
{"text":"I came to Arthurs around noon on a weekday to meet a friend for lunch, and was very excited because of the great reviews. Having arrived a little bit early, I scored a table on the patio, and quickly scoured the menu.  I had mentally settled on the mango salad with grilled chicken despite the cottage cheese pancakes practically begging me to order them from the table next to mine (pancakes = my weakness). My lunch date ordered the same salad sans chicken. As we waited for our food to come out, I realized that Arthurs is REALLY slow. They don't cater to quick in and out lunches that many people would likely need during the week over their lunch hour. Instead, it took well over an hour and a half before we were able to pay for our meals.  Anyways, I digress. To make a long story short, the salads were just ok. The portion is not great considering the hefty $20 price tag (Mandy's salads give you way more bang for your buck and tons more flavor) and the flavor is just meh. Not bad but not great and with only 4-5 tiny mango cubes, the emphasis here shouldn't be on the mango. I found myself wishing I had ordered something else (enter: pancakes). That being said, at the end of the meal, my friend and I split the chocolate babka due to the rave reviews, and that's where we heard angels singing from the sky. That thing is DELICIOUS. As much as I would never come back for a salad here, I would practically move in just to eat those delicious babkas all day.   Overall, $45 for two salads and a babka - kinda steep for what you get but maybe we made a mistake by ordering salads! I'll be back for the babka (and maybe the big fluffy pancakes)!"}
{"text":"This isn't your typical brunch place. Their food items are different but in a unique and delicious way. There's is usually a line-up, but the wait is never very long. They take good care of their customers, as they gave us small bites of their chocolate bread while waiting in line. All the plates we took were delicious and unique. The portion was just right to fill us up. The food comes quickly and the service is great.   Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Expérience mitigée. Nous savions que c'était une place avec de l'attente pour les brunchs le weekend, on s'est dit \" go ça vaut surement le coup \". On nous a dit \" 30/45min d'attente max \", pour attendre 1h30 et voir passer plusieuts groupes devant nous de 2 (alors qu'on était 4, il fallait garder deux tables de 2 à un moment non ?!!). Il semble qu'il y ait un traitement VIP, certaines personnes amies sont passées directement. Un peu amère de voir cela, on est juste un client  On lambda qui attend encore plus longtemps. Bref, on a quand même attendu tout ce temps pour voir le brunch qui en valait la peine. Nous sommes rentrées excitées, quand même. Au final : la bouffe est correcte mais sans plus, cela ne valait pas 15$ le plat..., 3,50 pour un thé en sachet basique, une musique très forte pour parler et un service médiocre. Très peu d'attention de la serveuse, qui nous répondait très sèchement. Je comprends le rush du weekend mais cela n'excuse en rien la qualité du service. J'ai dû demander deux fois un plat dessert à la fin, et à peine un sourire ou une parole courtoise. Vraiment déçue, je ne le recommanderais pas."}
{"text":"Quality, freshness, presentation all done very well. You can tell whoever is cooking here cares. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"I had the shakshouka. It was really good. It might be spicy for other people, but i love spicy. The pancake with organic honey was also very good. Will definitely come here again to try out other things from the menu, the moroccan toast looked really good."}
{"text":"Really good food here.  A bit hard to get into but worth it.  I try to go at non-peak hours.  Nice service.  I love the avoToast and Salami sandwich."}
{"text":"Where to start. Come here! Proper latkes, amazing cottage cheese pancakes, gravlax, challah & more. The liver toast was the best I've had in a long time! Only open til 3pm so they get really busy around 2. Suggest getting there before that. We did & beat the rush!"}
{"text":"Simply top breakfast/brunch spot in Montreal. Great atmosphere and everyone who works there is just super nice. The pancakes are some of the best I've ever had in a long time."}
{"text":"Very nice small spot in St-Henri, wish it was open later.  The Schnitzel sandwich is probably the most delicious thing on the menu. The Latkas are also very good. Haven't been for breakfest or brunch but lunch was delicious."}
{"text":"The salami sandwich might be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Explosion of flavors..  Staff is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Get ready to tuck into the best brunch you have ever experienced.   We started with the Challah bread with honey, butter, and salt. Amazing. Then we had the grapefruit with hemp seeds. I ended up squeezing the rind to enjoy every last drop. For mains, I took on the Grand Slam- Nashville style chicken, bacon, eggs, and pancakes. An amazing combination of tasty goodness. My better half had the Moroccan Toast, an incredible combination of chickpea, pomegranate, eggplant, cucumber, and poached egg- all on Challah toast.   Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Who knew you needed to be on a guest list to have breakfast? \"Friends come, first served\" seems to be the way this spot operates.   Waited over an hour outside to get two seats. Several people who got there after us got in quicker. Had to check in inside 5 times because staff doesn't come out to get you.   An additional 35 minute wait for one avocado toast and a salad...  It's 2017, your food is good but this city is filled with great food and even better service. Your friends won't keep you in business. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"My mother, aunt and I came in to Arthur's at 1:30 on a Saturday, we left our name and phone number then went next door to grab a coffee. The hostess told us it would be about a 30-45 minute wait. When we didn't receive a phone call 45 minutes later, we decided to go in and see what was going on. As we entered, a group of three that had given their name after us were being seated. The hostess then told us we would be the next to be seated. 30 minutes of standing later, about 5 groups of two had been seated. Instead of waiting for two groups of two to leave in order to give us a seat, the hostess continued to seat couples instead of us. We ended up being seated after over an hour and a half. At the end of the day, the hostess was a really sweet girl, she felt really bad about the whole situation. Unfortunately, she had not been properly taught on how to prioritize her reservation list. Thankful the food was great we had a wonderful waitress."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and a quaint place. The service was good. It's so packed, that sometimes we have to share our tables with some strangers. Do I mind? Not at all... nice way to make acquaintances. Service was amiable. Food was excellent, from the presentation to taste. It hits the right spot. Highly recommended! No reservations there though but the wait is worth it"}
{"text":"Location: In the St. Henri area. Street parking is available but metered. You can usually find parking on the streets that surround the park across the street. Right now there's construction in the area, so expect detours!   The place: Small and bright with communal tables and bar seating. If you sit at the back, then you see into the kitchen. If you want a table on a weekend then I'd suggest you get there when they open. We arrived around 10ish, and were able to get seated right away, at the communal table by the kitchen. We lucked out and no one joined us.  The goods: I ordered the pancakes with bacon, sausage and eggs (Grand Slam).  I rarely order pancakes but I know my friend and I would be out walking all day, so I wanted to fuel up. These pancakes were fantastic and doughy and delicious! I mean really, I could have eaten another batch but you have to draw a line somewhere. The beef bacon was good, though there was some fat - I'd never had beef bacon before but I quite liked it. I just didn't eat the fatty  bits. The sausage was OK - more like a giant hot dog, which I'm generally not a fan of. They will cook the way you ask them to, so don't be shy about letting them know what you like (but don't ask them to scramble - I don't think they'll do that!). My friend ordered the Moroccan something.... salad? I don't remember, but she loved it. We were both super happy with out meals, and while we were 100% satisfied, we didn't feel stuffed.   Service: Good.  Price point: I think it might be a little expensive, but I do think the quality of the ingredients + portions warrant the prices. I'd include coffee to balance things out."}
{"text":"Being from NYC, I know good Jewish food, so this was not my first experience. First suggestion, you should nosh on your hands while you wait. The manager is the worst! He never came out to get names, making people stand on line forever before realizing they had to go inside to find out the wait was \"30 minutes,\" but actually 2 hours! The owner was good - offering coffee and samples of babka. She also offered us a free mini fruit plate for the wait. Definitely tasty food, but sad to see the place is being managed by someone who if you're friends with, you will get seated first, but if you're from out of town, you'll have to wait hours."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite brunch place! Make sure to be there before 11 if you dont want to line up!  The staffs are very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied.  They have a special brunch menu on the weekend, but if you can also take anything on their regular menu as well. The food taste amazing. This time I had their new item on the menu, which was egg on top of a mashed potatoes galette topped with beef. It was amazing! Slightly too salty for me (the beef). I also had their smoked salmon on the brunch menu and it was nicely paired with salad, and some caviar on top.  One down side is that they only offer filter coffees. So for latte lovers, youd have to walk a few blocks to go to Cafe St-Henri!"}
{"text":"This is probably (definitely) my favorite brunch place in Montreal. If you're gunna splurge, this is the place to do it. The wait staff was friendly and fun. Great vibes. It was worth the wait and everything you've heard about this place is true.  The brunch bloody Caesar with the mini lox bagel was incredible. The lox is so freaking good. I'm jewish, and this place knows how to do their latkas."}
{"text":"I went there recently with friends early(10AM) on a sunday morning and was surprised there was a two hour wait. We ended up going somewhere else. Maybe we'll come by another time."}
{"text":"Ok here's the thing: I have a love/hate relationship with Arthur's. The things I love: the food. Most of the dishes I have had have been really tasty. If you like Jewish deli/breakfast food, you will love Arthur's menu choice. So far everything I have had including the latka smorgasbord was well made with good ingredients. Things I don't like: the wait. It's so long and it seems like people get preferential treatment. Even if you show up at 9am, be ready to wait."}
{"text":"A hidden jem that only the locals know about.   Went there for Sunday brunch.  It was very busy we thought but soon after we sat at the bar a lineup of 15 deep formed outside the door.  Small place and hence it took nearly 20 minutes after placing the order for the food arrival.   Good looking and friendly staff.  Food was amazing as far as brunch goes.   It would have been nice if during our long wait for food to arrive they gave a free refill on the coffee or a free 1.5$ pickle or something.   Just saying ... I like businesses that give a little away free to keep their customers happy .. it's the thought that really counts.    Next time in nice weather I would order take out before arriving ... pick it up and take it across to the beautiful park across the street and have a romantic picnic.  Mush faster and away from the chaos."}
{"text":"Ambiance: le dimanche midi, très bruyant en plus de la musique qui est assez forte Service: top Bouffe: MIAM! Le sandwich au schnitzel était É-COEURANT et le sandwich au gravlax aussi! Les pierogies étaient moins dans ma palette de gout mais quand meme bien faits! Will we go back? Pas le dimanche midi! Mais peut etre a un moment ou cest plus calme!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots! It can be a bit discouraging when you show up and see a big line, but the food and service makes the line worth it. I have tried a lot off their menu and my absolute favorite thing to order is the avocado toast. It's a simple yet delicious dish and very filling. The scramble is also very good. Their potato latkes are so yummy that you are left with wanting more. Service is pretty fast and the staff are very attentive towards you. I highly recommend Arthurs."}
{"text":"Always a line up because its novelty, so dont go there starving! Totally worth the wait though. The place itself is nice, although the pictures seem to make it look much bigger.  Service is great, super friendly people, and the owner is very approachable and cool. He would come out to the waiting line and offer free sample while you wait. Our waitress was very helpful in describing and suggesting meals.  We were fortunate enough to be able to take their seasonal grand slam, which was a combination of their chicken shnitzel and...something else (see picture!). Food overall is delicious, and the kitchen's got it coming out smoothly even with it being full house for a few hours in a row.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a nice time for brunch at Arthurs. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I like the way the space is designed but it felt a little over crowded. The food was good but nothing special. I had the Latke smorgasbord and a tea and it came to almost $20 with tax, which felt a little overprice for the amount of food."}
{"text":"Really delicious food in a cool spot on Notre-Dame but slow service.   Went at lunchtime today so the restaurant was full. Had to wait long before someone came to take our order. No one brought us water so I had to ask for some. There were a lot of interesting choices on the menu; I opted for the salmon gravlax plate at $18 and my coworker got the club sandwich for $15. Yummy flavour and texture combinations. The salmon was somewhat filling whereas the sandwich put you in a food coma!! Had to also wait long to pay.   Will definitely be going back to try some of their other menu items and to also try their brunch options."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  First time was great. Great food, great service.   Second time: awful. I ordered the same thing (shakshouka) since I really enjoyed it the first time. The second time I ordered it, my eggs were over cooked (supposed to be poached, they were not even close to runny). My toast was also burnt on one side. The waitress took it back and I received the same over cook hard boiled eggs.    I was also seated in the middle of a table between two groups of 7 people total. No one noticed me or took my order for over 5 minutes until the manager that sat me there realized I hadn't been served.   Honestly. I was impressed the first time.  The second time left a bad taste in my mouth (literally)."}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place is the wait! Outside in the cold and/or the rain or even inside, next to the cold blowing in through the door and the curtain... Et les meilleures choses sont les \"babka\"! Fait, sûrement, avec amour par un rabbin local, ils sont tellement bon, goût de cannelle ou de chocolat! Just great! This place is not kosher but uses a lot of healthy, kosher products. Les garnitures de fruits et de légumes sont fraîches et délicieuses.  Just go early of on 'off hours', pour éviter de perdre patience et manger ailleurs!  Namaste"}
{"text":"First time trying a smorgasbord and I was digging it!  The only thing that I wasn't too thrilled about was the service. Since we were outside, I felt like we were neglected at times. Other than that, great brunch place!"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in the neighborhood and possibly the city. They hit the spot on every dish! The pickles are amazing and highly recommend the pancakes! This Jewish style food is on point!"}
{"text":"Probs my favourite brunch place in mtl. Tried it for the first time yesterday (long overdue) and I fell in love. We were four people, tired a bit of everyone's food and it was all bloody delish. Service was good, nice people! Can't wait to go back :))"}
{"text":"Came her for breakfast on a thursday morning. We waited 20 minutes to get seated and we finally got a table in the middle of the place, we barely had space to move our chairs or put our jackets. The coat hangers were right next to me and full, giving me the feeling I was eating in stranger's jackets the whole time. People waiting were so close to us I felt invaded. The food was good, I got the avocado toast, but the breakfast sandwich was quite plain. Not impressed."}
{"text":"By far the best pancakes I've had so far. Simply two house pancakes with maple syrup.  Great service and friendly atmosphere.  Expect a short wait to be seated!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday around noon. Waited for 30 minutes to be seated, it was pretty packed. The food was delicious. The staff is really friendly. I had their famous moroccan toast, was too good! WIll definitely come back here to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot! The menu is so perfect it was difficult to choose what to get. We were eyeing the cottage cheese pancakes someone at the table next to us had (they looked amazing), but settled on the breakfast sandwich and scramble, both with challah toast. Breakfast sandwich was a bit spicy but still amazing. Scramble was perfect, as was the challah. Interior of the restaurant is cozy and exactly what you want in a breakfast spot. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for a late Sunday brunch. Shakshouka was full of flavor and the perfect portion. The pancakes were good but next time I would opt for the french toast. Lovely staff, ambience and terrace! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place a 5 star cause I dislike how far this place is for me. Food here was absolutely sublime and effortlessly met my extremely high expectation for brunch.  I genuinely believe brunch spots in Montreal beats any other city I have been to and Arthur's has made it to the list of top 5.  We had to wait for an hour, and we were cold but I completely forgot about it as soon as I saw the waitress get my food. As perfect as a romantic ballad, the presentation was over exceeded by the taste. I got the Moroccan toast, blackmailed my husband to get the shakshuka and of course stole a bit of my friend's Grand slam.  The Moroccan toast had tahini and eggplant cooked to perfection topped with fried chickpeas and pomegranate- all those combined was like a party in my mouth.  I have already decided for myself and others what we are getting next time- now it's just an agonizing wait.   Highly recommend this spot, it's a bit small and crowded but the dishes make up for it. Also wasn't happy with the service or the shortbread I impulse purchased on the way out."}
{"text":"Arthur's is easily one of my new favourites in a verrrrry long while. It's nice to see something new in Montreal, atypical from the general brunch scene. The space is usually lively (expect to wait on weekends) and beautiful! The staff are nice and friendly. The menu, well, I'd certainly like to try it all. A good mix of Jewish and Jew-ish plates ;) I'll be back! If I'm lucky :)  Definitely go!"}
{"text":"I would only recommend this restaurant if you are flexible with your schedule and have a lot of time.   When we arrived, there was already a pack of disorganized people crammed near the entrance inside and outside the restaurant. Despite the disarray, after much deliberation, we decided to join the queue: a decision we later came to regret.   Although this place is hip and popular, the wait was extremely uncomfortable as we were packed like sardines near the entrance. I do believe that a better queue system could be implemented.   After what seemed like an interminable and unpleasant wait, we were given two stools facing the window. My anticipation built as I perused the menu: shakshouka, smorgasbord, Moroccan toast... everything looked delectable!  My first disappointment: after ordering my drink, I was told it was unavailable after 10 minutes.   Second disappointment: because of our placement (we were seated in a corner facing the window), our waitress was mostly absent and took our orders later than other patrons who got seated much later than us. Because of this, we waited almost 15 minutes just to get our order (and we had to call the attention of the waitress to do so).   Thirdly: our food took a very long time to be prepared and I had almost lost my appetite at that point.   I admit that the meal was quite delicious but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.   Overall, based on first impressions, I would not return because of the inattentive and slow service from our absent waitress (most likely due to our seating placement): the time from arrival to departure was more than 2.5 hours, mostly wait time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant in Saint-Henri. The interior design is close to the feel of English bistros. The staff is friendly and efficient, and they play good music that doesn't take over conversations.  The food is outstanding and different from any other brunch restaurant. Their drinks worth a try. I definitely recommend the place for a brunch with the girls or a romantic morning.   Only down side, it's crowded, even on week days."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have super delicious brunch that has the usual fares, as well as some dishes that expand beyond the normal brunch options. The line up could go quite long during the weekends, so it's definitely a good idea to go early (or super late) to avoid the crowd. You can go to Rustique pie next door for a bite while waiting. lol  My favorite is the Grand Slam with Syrniki (pancakes), fried egg and hot chicken. Yum! It satisfied my cravings for both sweet and savory! The Moroccan toast is also quite interesting and packs lots of flavors."}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT!!!! I rated it 4 stars because of the service that was kinda long and because it seams like even if everyone is waiting super long in line, if some friends of employees pass by they get seated almost instantly.. i have to say that usually I'm not a fan of place that requires connection to go eat but other then service that was lacking, the food was simply out of this world"}
{"text":"This little cafe is good for brunch or lunch. I saw a video of mc Arthur sandwich on Facebook and was very interested. I am vegan so I didn't eat the mc Arthur but my sister and dad ordered and was very pleased with the sandwich. I got the Rae's salad and it was very scrumptious. When we entered the restaurant we were greeted and assisted to a table immediately. The staffs are friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, thought out cuisine.   The owner of this place is quite the breakfast genius and I'd strongly recommend eating here if you're in the area.   Amazing quality food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Si vous vous trouvez à St-Henri pour le brunch, Arthurs Nosh Bar est l'une de vos meilleures options! Ceci dit, vous risquez de faire la file si vous y allez durant le week-end.  Ce restaurant vous propose des spécialités juives avec un twist moderne. Vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec le latke shmorgasboard: une assiette qui comprend des oeufs brouillés, du gravlax, une salade de concombres, des latkes et un rouleau de challah délicieux.   De plus, le décor épuré avec comptoirs de marbre blanc, murs de tuiles blanches, chaises et banquettes en cuir couleur caramel, et accents verts fait de cette place un endroit esthétiquement agréable pour les yeux."}
{"text":"Oh the schnitzel McArthur sandwich! Or the club! Oh even the cheese melt! Oh oh and don't forget the salads!!! And the fries...super crispy on the outside, tender on the inside...  These guys know how to make a simple dish exquisite, period."}
{"text":"Had the classic breakfast and the Shiah burger. Amazing service staff. Their patio is dog friendly where staff were all going Gaga all over your fur pets. Go early because we arrived 10 minutes after they opened and we got the last table."}
{"text":"We both ordered the shakshoushka and it was delicious! This plate is only offered on the weekend. It is very nicely decorated. We only waited about 20 Minutes for a table. It was packed. They have a nice menu, a great outdoor seating area which releases some of the congestion, and I would be back to try the other treats. It's a happening place that mainly caters to the twenty something crowd."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch on our first visit, was recommended by a friend. Staff was friendly and attentive, food portions were just right not obscene. Will definitely go again if ever back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good the only downside is that  the space between the tables is very sparse should be re-organized"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Friday. We got there right before the big rush and were seated at the bar.  They don't take reservation so if you don't want to wait, get there early!  The menu is quite simple. Shared the trout gravlax and schnitzel. The trout was very tasty and the caviar added a nice touch to the flavour. Schnitzel was moist and I liked the touch of heat in the sauce.  Would go back to try the breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here. The oatmeal was very sweet and I couldn't eat it so I returned it. They charged me for it anyway and I didn't argue about paying. When I made a suggestion to the owner about describing it in greater detail on the menu he replied with a very sarcastic derogatory comment.   This young man should not be in the service business.   This place doesn't offer a nice enough experience for the expensive prices they charge."}
{"text":"Typically, I try not to let poor customer service ruin delicious food for me, but I'm pretty bummed and probably won't be going back anytime soon. In a nutshell, you're not important unless you're a friend. Seems to be a common complaint, which is sad because this is a new restaurant, and as good as the food may be, a crucial key to longevity is customer service. The front of the house is always packed, but no one is ever around to keep everything in order and attend to the customers in an orderly fashion. You're basically left standing there, clueless, until you're able to flag someone down. If I'm going to a restaurant, I expect to be acknowledged, no matter how busy the joint is. Not down."}
{"text":"When in Montreal make it your 1st and last stop owner so persoanable and generous great vibe  McArthur sandwich magnificent flavor unique quinoa gluten free salad best ever multi flavored perfectly crafted. Latke and scrambled eggs on the house for the inconvenience of waiting  the bear door in the bathroom another unique twist."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a weekday. It was just about full but my party of 2 was seated almost immediately. The food is fresh/healthy, so a good lunch option but not life changingly great. I had a kale salad and my friend had the latke smorgasbord, which had a small amount of delicious caviar, a good latke, some nice gravlax, very soft scrambled eggs, and this strange dark apple sauce, among other things. The bathroom is tiny and narrow and pretty cool. The decor and atmosphere is also fresh and nice."}
{"text":"Took a while to get to this review, wanted to do it proper justice. Went a couple of weekends ago. Sat afternoon around 1, roughly 30min wait. Nice coffee shop across the street to grab a drink before until they call you back ready to seat.  Sat at the bar and started with the Latke Shmorgasboard and a Bloody Caesar to hold us over until we decided on more courses.  The Caesar was the best I ever had. Waiter/Bartender/Maker of said Caesar was happy to hear it.  Then came the Latkes. Heavy on the onions, just the way I like mine. Best I ever had. Light, fluffy, salty, crunchy, gooey-oniony... just perfect.  Then came my \"Grand Slam\". Fried Chicken, cottage-cheese pancakes (Syrniki?), beef bacon (didn't even know this was a thing?)...  I had to restrain myself from repeating \"Best I ever had\" but man... what a combo.  Told the staff we came in from New York for the weekend and it blew away a certain other \"Montreal Jewish Deli\" in NYC...  He suggested we try the babka. We had no room but he insisted it's a must have. And a Must Have it IS!!!  Yes, I know you're tired of reading about it. It IS the best Babka I ever had. Crispy on the outside (finished w clarified butter), beautiful cinnamon-sugar on the inside. Cinnamon takes a backseat to no Babka! Indeed!  Cannot wait to go back. And this will be part of our regular Montreal rotation for sure.  And yes, sincerely sorry for inflating expectations for everyone else, maybe it was the two strongly poured Caesars, but some of these things were definitely the best I ever had in those categories."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and had such a great time. The atmosphere, friendliness of staff, food was fantastic! Had the smorgasbord, McArthur sandwich, and pancakes - everything was delicious, cant wait to come back fo try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"{updated again}  Went both Saturday&Sunday this week because the food is just that good.  Sadly Sunday was super disappointing, every time I got with my boyfriend we are let down.  Service was atrocious on Sunday, the food was 50/50. I tried something new because they ran out of Moroccan toast. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was ok, the eggs were a little too gooey for my liking (but I'm a picky egg eater) and it was hard to eat without falling apart, my boyfriend had the Arthur's sandwich and it was really good!    Sadly, I wish the service would just be consistent and FAIR.   Anyways, the food is spectacular and the service is always a 50/50. It's either fantastic and above average or it's \"we could care less\"        {Update and more stars, } After returning twice with my best friend, who raves about their pancakes. (They really are the best pancakes in the city!) I've had nothing but wonderful experiences.  After my previous review the owner reached out, explaining what went wrong, which I absolutely appreciate.   They've been working out the little service kinks I've mentioned in my previous post, and the service and food gets better every time. They are always slammed on the weekend, so if you see people coming in and \"randomly\" getting seated chances are they'd gone next store to have coffee while they wait! (Alas! It makes sense!)  I really like this place!    {Original post} GREAT location and DELICIOUS food! I want to try everything on the menu! Will definitely be back.  I loved their home made hot sauce (they charge a dollar for it) The plates are super tasty, not huge portion but good sizes.  Decoration is super cute and homey but a little on the squishy side; the music throws you off. ( really loud gangsta.. you get used to it but it doesn't fit the decor. Haha I sound like a gramma!!)   Had to ask for everything, ketchup, hot sauce , more coffee, cream, sugar, anything extra you needed . Would of like our super polite and smiley waitress to check on us a bit more but over all she was great! & they were busy.   The one thing that really threw me off and almost had my boyfriend and I walk out without even trying to place was the hostess. I'm really glad we stayed but. She wasn't very friendly at all, she told me there was an hour wait, when I'd just called and they said there wasn't a wait (we live a five minute walk) and I could see five tables getting ready to leave.(as they did) What really annoyed me was, we were four sets of twos waiting at the door, my boyfriend and myself 2nd in line and she unnecessarily bumped her two friends that came in last before everyone else, when we all were going to be seated in the span of five minutes. I personally found it a touch rude. Didn't change anything in anyone's life but all six of us noticed.  After she tried to squish us all together, my boyfriend and I asked if we could actually sit at the empty bar (you can watch their grade manger work his magic! Guy was AMAZING!) and she was like \"yeah sure wait for someone to set it up\" and walked away. So we awkwardly stood there for a few minutes and then just sat ourselves. Meh it happens but wasn't cool.   I wish they did cafe au lait; but they don't have a fancy coffee machine but they do have freshly ground coffee beans that makes really good strong. Coffee.   Definitely a place to try in our hood!"}
{"text":"Arthur's is a great place for brunch, especially in the summer. If you're willing to wait before getting seated, it's definitely a must in the city.   Lineups are to be expected especially on Saturday and Sunday. We went for brunch on a Sunday and waited around twenty minutes before getting seated. We could have been seated earlier inside but we were keen on getting a spot on their terrasse. To compensate for the wait, the staff distributed delicious chocolate bakba to the people in line, which was very appreciated. The Shah special and the avocado toast were both delicious and the service was surprisingly fast considering that the restaurant was pretty much full. We also recommend getting a mimosa or freshly pressed orange juice with your meal. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best lunch/ brunch spots in the city. The gravlax sandwich and the schnitzel are both to die for. Loved the Miami style chicken salad for a light lunch too. They have specials all of the time and they make a mean mimosa!:) staff is super friendly and accommodating. Cute decor. LOVE IT ALL!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the wait. We ended up ordering 3 courses because there were too many must-have options to choose from! Staff was incredibly  friendly and enthusiastic. Don't leave without a babka!!!"}
{"text":"The food we received (eventually) was excellent.  The \"service\" is downright awful and the manager or owner? (tall skinny guy) got defensive when questioned about the poor service. Maybe he will figure out how to correct the issues instead of creating excuses.  If you are prepared to tolerate horrible service and attitude then this is the place for you as you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"The food here was great! Since I gave up on pork years ago, I love it that this place has beef bacon! Dishes I tried are McArthur sandwich and the soup.  One minus point for the freaking line up and no instructions to just go in and give your name first. My friend who came before and didn't know that you had to give in your name ended up lining up for nothing."}
{"text":"Bright, bustling brunch-lunch spot that's amazing for groups. Tip: For a larger group of 5+ in the summer, ask to sit in the back terrace. You have to go through the kitchen and get to soak in the sun on a picnic table!   To drink: Red and white wines. Relatively small wine selection - Only 2-3 reds and whites and one rose. Iced coffee was OK.   To eat: Chicken salad and egg salad scoops served with toasts, house-pickled and fresh veggies. The pickled veggies are unreal!   Perogies. Pan fried crispy on the outside. Ultimate comfort food.   Latkes with house made apple sauce and sour cream. Ultimate comfort food x 2.   Chicken schnitzel with chimichurri - Soooo crispy! Chimichurri adds a welcome freshness to the plate... Typically unexpected with schnitzel.   Salmon gravlax plate with cream cheese and toasts. Easily our favourite dish of the day. Jam packed with flavour and a sure win for any salmon lover.   Service: Excellent service during a super busy weekday lunch rush. Was attentive for our group of six and made sure we were all good even though we were the only table out on the back terrace. Our server made very good menu recommendations.   To try: Would love to return for brunch"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Arthur's going in and I have to say they delivered! We came as a group of 5 for a late lunch on a Thursday and didn't have to wait too long for a table (definitely show up early or else at almost any time there is a lineup and limited seating). I had their Caesar and it was very good topped with olives and a pickle and just a hint of spicy , I really enjoyed it ! I also had the matza ball soup which was basically delicious homey comfort In a bowl , the fresh dill really added something to it. My colleagues had the cabbage soup which they also raved about. They also enjoyed the latkes. Then we had the perogies which were only just okay. BUT then I had the thanksgiving dinner sandwich which was SO SO delicious , it's basically  what it sounds like , which is thanksgiving dinner between challah bread -including roasted turkey (not cold cut turkey) , cranberry sauce , challah bread stuffing and it was to die for, salty sweet tangy and awesome  ! The others at the table were raving about the mcarthur sandwich they said they loved every bite and that it had such great flavours and the Chicken portion inside was very generous and juicy. Another person at our table had the salami sandwich and also really enjoyed it , however the only sandwich one person said was just okay was the roast beef sandwich they said it just lacked a little flavour. I'm already dying to come back here to try more of their lunch items and to try their brunch!! It's also worth mentioning that our waitress gave us great service and was so friendly and took great care of us ! I highly recommend Arthur's for brunch or lunch !"}
{"text":"I always hate having to downgrade a review but sometimes a repeat visit to a business is just not as good as the first one.  You see I went back to Arthur's a second time and while the food was just as good as my first visit the service was not.  My friend and I waited over an hour to get a table only to see friends of the manager come in and get seated without any kind of wait.  Um excuse me?  How about seating some of the other customers that have been waiting a heck of a lot longer?  That left a real sour taste in my mouth and it really turns me off from going back there."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of hype about this place, so i was expecting a lot. Surprisingly, there was no line on a Friday around lunch time.   The Caesar i had was one of the best i've had. The tomato juice they use was very fresh and well seasoned. It is on the spicier side, so I would not suggest it to ones sensitive to heat. Their signature drink, slushie Rosé with peach purée is also a definite must try.  I ordered the Latke Smorgasbord. The potatoes in the latke were finely grated and it was crisp on the outside. It was topped with a dollop of sour cream and homemade apple sauce. The scrambled where cooked right: runny and creamy. The bread was well toasted on all sides, slightly dense from being pressed and with just a touch of sweetness. Every component of that plate was well executed.   The Avo Toast which was topped with a sunny side up egg was simple, but good as well. Our server suggested my friend to add a serving of the Malt Vinegar Fries since the toast was small for a meal. The fries were very crispy, definitely double fried, and coated with the vinegar.  Overall, i was very much pleased with all the dishes and drinks. I will definitely come back to try the huge Schnitzel and brunch on the weekends.   The only downsides are that we were a little thrown off at first by having to find our own seats since we were sent to 2 tables that were taken and also, for espresso lovers, they only serve regular coffee."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Sunday at noon. It's a great addition to the area. We had to wait almost an hour for our table because it was really happening. The time went by fast though because it gave my friend time to talk and catch up. There's a counter for people to order food and we were all standing in front of it all squished together.   There were a lot of things on the menu. I was not expecting that. I'm not too familiar with Jewish breakfast food so I wasn't sure what to order and decided based on the waitress' recommendation. The food was good. I ordered the Arthurs Caesar and had the Latke Smorgasbord which consisted of  gravlax, scrambled eggs, sour cream, caviar, English cucumber salad and black Russian bread. the gravlax was good but I found the portion was smaller than I expected so I was a bit disappointed. The eggs were light and fluffy. The Latke had a sweet sauce on top. I think it was apple and I would have preferred it without it. I tried to removed as much of it off and kept the sour cream on top. My friend had the tuna melt. She was expecting a sandwich but she pretty much had to eat it with a fork and knife. She wasn't complaining about it though. I would want to go back and try their other stuff especially the shakshouka because a few people were eating it around me and it looked so good! Next time Arthurs, next time!!"}
{"text":"Had cottage cheese pancake with freshly squeezed orange juice, it was amazing! I usually don't like pancakes a lot however this was really good and not too sweet. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch! Their pancakes are perfect. Also try their shakshouka  The only problem is that there are a lot of wasps if you're going to sit outside ."}
{"text":"Resto de spécialités juives dans une ambiance moderne retro à St-Henri. Nous avons essayés le brunch un samedi matin. Conseil pratique, arrivés tôt car, vous allez attendre en file. On a patienter un bon 30/45 minutes dehors. Restaurant rempli mais le service fût quand même rapide une fois à l'intérieur. J'ai bien aimé mon latke smorgasbord (15,50$) & mon café filtre (3$). Ma copine a pris la même chose, total avec taxes/service = 47$. Bonne suggestion pour un bon déjeuner/brunch de qualité dans le coin.   4/5 visité en mars 2018"}
{"text":"Avoid going there in the weekend! It is so so crowded and the service is not so good. I went there quite early to avoid the lineup, but the staff who welcomes me didn't give a table right away even though I saw several free tables available and asked to be seated. However, the food is quite good, but the brunch didn't really stand out compared to the regular menu, the Moroccan toast was sooo good! But the smoked salmon plate was a bit disappointing because of the small portion and lack of flavour. The plating is nice but I find the brunch is a bit overpriced. The regular dishes on the menu look a bit more fairly priced. Yes it is a super popular restaurant and I enjoyed the food, probably will come back to try out the regular menu choices!"}
{"text":"Having lived in New York and Chi-town I'm no stranger to the nosh bar scene- Arthur's is really up there. I've had most of the menu and now thing is disappointing it's insane how good the quality of the food is. The brunch specials are insanely good from the Morrocan Challah toast to the Grand Slam you just can't go wrong. Side note the Syrniki pancakes are to die for and this is coming from a person who hates cottage cheese!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm always a fan of unconventional brunch places, so coming here I had no hesitations. The only flaw I found was that our beef bacon was overcooked to the point of having it be inedible but the rest of the food was great."}
{"text":"My parents and family are from Poland, so I know my Eastern European food. I also lived in NYC for several years and was spoiled with access to delicious babka, pierorgies etc., so I was excited to try this place. It was a real disappointment. It's essentially decent-- but def not great-- overpriced EE food in a hip area. The coffee was good, but it's $3 and the server never refilled my cup, despite the place not being busy. The server also never checked to see if I needed anything after serving the food.The scrambled eggs were undercooked; the latkes were not very tasty and overcooked. This place basically made me really miss Veselka in NYC-- lots of character and serves up delicious E. European staples for a reasonable price. Arthur's is like those hip places that open up in Brooklyn that just makes you want to go to a Polish deli and get the real deal for less money.I would probably still come here and overpay if the food and service were on point, but they weren't.  When I'm in the neighborhood, I'll be going to La Luncheonette for brunch--friendly, reasonably priced, delicious food."}
{"text":"Ate here after running a marathon- we were so hungry and they were closing in 4 minutes but happily welcomed 7 of us in! The food was Jewish inspired, very fresh and incredibly satisfying. We found the unique brunch menu to be full of comfort food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute but a bit small. As a result the waiting time is ridiculous. We waited 40 min. on a  Sunday for lunch. The staff is very welcoming and hard working.The food tries to be traditional Jewish with a modern twist. It misses the mark on a number of their dishes. But the part that upset us the most were the prices, outrageous. $3 for a Moishe's pickle. It is a \"hipster\" place, for people who miss Grandma's food, and want to be seen by others. Did not feel it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place for brunch! Since it doesn't take reservations, I went there on a Sunday right where it opened. For a small and quaint space, it still accommodated a group of 7 people really well. The place was nicely decorated, modern and rustic with the white tiles, wooden tables and gold accents. The staff was extremely friendly as well and there was practically no wait for our food. What I love about this place is how it introduces you to Jewish food with a modern twist! It's a lot more fun than your typical brunch food. I had the shakshuka which I thought was great, especially with the additional of pomegranate seeds. I got to try their fluffy pancakes which are amazing. It's a bit pricey but still worth it! Arthurs is also a bit out of the way, but by being in a quiet residential neighbourhood, it's easy to find parking. I will be eating here again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here 3-4 times and there is always a lineup. They're considerate though and pass out tastings of their amazing chocolate babka. I keep wanting to try something different for brunch, but always gravitate towards the shakshuka. Simply delish! Try the perogies; they change them up every season. One negative point: they don't have lattés; only drip."}
{"text":"My favourite Brunch and Lunch spot in Montreal! Amazing food and amazing quality of food too! Great staff love this place!!"}
{"text":"Fall is always a crazy time schedule-wise for myself especially on weekends so when a rare free morning appeared, the only logical thing to do in my mind was to go brunch. A lot of good new brunch options have continued to pop up in and around Montreal but the one that has really grabbed my attention recently was the new one closest to me - Arthurs Nosh Bar. Situated on my favourite strip of Notre Dame Ouest in St-Henri, Arthurs is the brainchild of the owners of Back of House Catering, Raegan Steinberg and Alex Cohen. The couple's Jewish restaurant is open for breakfast, brunch and lunch and has a great look and feel.  Walking in, the space feels a touch traditional Jewish deli but with some more modern sleekness. I love the combination of the penny-tiled floor, the huge green back bar lined with jars and bottles as well as the letter board menus. There is even the candy jar on the counter! But then you add the marble countertops, the bistro chairs, the leather banquets and the black-and-white pictures on the walls... the experience feels more refined than a Jewish Deli. The awesome musical mix creates a more relaxed fun atmosphere as well - anytime you have my sister and I both smiling at the choices, you are doing it right.  The menu for Brunch is a mix of Jewish dishes - more Eastern European traditions from what I understand - with some modern touches. We ended up sticking to the more traditional stuff. My sister went for the Latke Smorgasbord - Latke served with gravlax, scrambled eggs, sour cream, tomato, cucumber and caviar. A solid portion with every element working well. The latke was excellent with a nice crunch to it. The texture on the gravlax was beautiful and the eggs were nice and fluffy.  I went for something I had never heard of before - Syrniki or cottage cheese pancakes. I normally don't like cottage cheese on its own but its inclusion in the pancakes created a wonderfully fluffy and rich texture. Add a generous pour of maple syrup overtop and I was in pancake heaven. The pancakes were huge which made for a very filling plate. I still added a side of grilled salami to get a little kick with the sweetness overload. Grilling the salami gave it a little crunch which was a nice texture contrast to the pancakes.  To finish the brunch, we decided to split a piece of Cinnamon Babka - essentially a Jewish play on a Cinnamon Roll. Nice cinnamon flavour, fluffy texture and a little sweet glaze over the top - nothing to complain about here.  Arthur Nosh Bar certainly held up to my expectations... and given how the restaurant filled up within 20 minutes of it opening on the Sunday we visited, I guess plenty of others are satisfied as well. Outside of a Deli, we don't get much exposure to Jewish cuisine so it is great to see something so different in the Montreal landscape. I would definitely be interested in a dinner menu if ever they decide to go that route. In the meantime, I will simply come back to enjoy more great Brunch and Lunch fare!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Arthur's Nosh Bar using Foodora. Specifically, two sandwiches: the salami sandwich (which I view as decent... a slightly nicer version of a Wilensky's sandwich maybe) and the house turkey sandwich (which was solid). Found the price reasonable - albeit it slightly more pricey than a typical option. I'll probably order from them again and will try their less \"run-of-the-mill\" noshes (e.g., perogies, latkes, and even the challah grilled cheese).  Update: Tried ordering delivery from them (through Foodora) again. About 30 minutes after I ordered, they canceled the order. Not a convenient outcome (especially when you need to feed a young kid with a \"low blood sugar level\". Neither the resto, nor the intermediary (Foodora) were helpful post-cancelation. Foodora even claims that a refund for my order may take 10 days to happen!"}
{"text":"As a humble jewish-fare-fangirl I can safely say that having this joint in the neighbourhood is an absolute danger to my pocketbook. I indulged last week in the fried salami, latkes and eggs plate for breakfast which was a consistent delight. The bottomless coffee served with breakfast is also top-notch and the service accompanying it was wonderful. The space itself is beautiful- it's like crystal palace meets your favourite café.  I was a little disappointed with the baked goods they had out on the weekday I came to visit- I tried the two sprinkle cookies they had out (the only options other than the cinnamon bun) and while they were fun, my coworker and I found them basic and indistinguishable from one another. I'm seriously looking forward to seeing these guys up their pastry game."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot and that was packed within 5 minutes of opening for a reason. The service was phenomenal, and what seemed like the owner walked around passing out babka to customers waiting outside. We shared The Classic (bagel with lox), the brunch special Shakshuka and Potato Latkes. Being Jewish New Yorkers, everything lived up to par and the hype. The shakshuka was tremendous and even had some avocado which was a great touch. The lox and bagel were great, and the latkes made me miss the holidays. 100% recommend for anybody visiting Montreal looking for a great spot for breakfast, brunch, or lunch."}
{"text":"I tried 5 things on the menu and all were outstanding. In fact everyone I sat with felt the same. The service was quick even though the restaurant was at capacity. It's got small seating capacity but it's beautifully designed and very comfortable. Will go back anytime."}
