{"text":"This was our first time!  Such a friendly staff!  We loved the special cheese dip and had fajitas, very good! We will definitely be back. Please try, you will like!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for street tacos but I wouldn't recommend dining here on Taco Tues.  The service was sub par and the tacos were cold.  Very different from our past and usual experience here.    The pork tacos are a fav along with the fish tacos.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"New favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The plates are based on Mexican street-style tacos. They don't have same typical combination entrees that you'd find at any local taqueria. They have a long list of tacos as well as fajitas and every creation that comes from the kitchen is inventive and unique. Pineapple salsas on the shrimp tacos, bbq'd carne asada, and plantains are just a few of my favorite things here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and there is never a wait. Food is delicious and fresh. I've gotten the shrimp and also ground beef tacos. The salsa and queso dip with chips are yummy!  Good place to bring the family."}
{"text":"New to the area and passed by this restaurant right after they opened. The service was very friendly; they took a while to take our order so comped us a queso dip (we never complained, they apologized and offered to us).The food was delish. We've had tacos, quesadilla, burger, fajitas and everything has been very good, very authentic Mexican. Last time we came it was a Saturday night and a lot busier than our first visit so service was a bit slower but still very friendly. We enjoy coming here and will continue."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The Tacos and Margaritas are magnificent, but this place is not limited when it comes to the service we've experienced from Shelby, Alex and Leo. Every time we've dine-in they give us A++ customer service. But back to the Margarita, we recommend you try their Cadillac, it will definitely take you for ride. Everything is fresh and made to order. I can't believe this restaurant is in our backyard, we are fortunate. - Dawn & Alex"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best food and service in this area. The fundito is to die for and there is endless tequila! If you want traditional Mexican with foodie flare then this is the place."}
{"text":"I admit been here two times in less than a week. Above average service, incredible food, huge tequila and draft list, and stupid specials. Go eat here!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. Really terrible cleanliness.  Salsa had dish water in it.  Water glass was disgusting."}
{"text":"My mother wanted a wrap or a taco...we ended up here. My mother will say \"this is the best chimichanga I've ever had\" and it looked delicious (I did not sample it), I had a Chicken Torta (sandwich) which was awesome...thin crispy breaded chicken with pinto purée, slices of avocado and a brown mustard; served with fries which were very crispy and not overly salty (which is a good thing). I had a skinny margarita which was pretty good...there was a flavor that was a tad overpowering that I couldn't quite place. Service was great with warm chips brought immediately to the table, took a little while to get a box and the check but it was getting busier inside the restaurant? Overall I enjoyed it and if I was in the area I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, try a combo. I the bartender was great. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is that I like hard shell tacos and they only serve soft flour or soft corn shells. I"}
{"text":"The Salsa and Chips were good. Steak Fajitas was tough and pricey. Little chaotic and service  needs some work but they are new and so I'll give them some grace there."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre food and service. The menu is diverse and sounds amazing on paper. In regards to execution the food was mostly overcooked and lacked flavor. Maybe they are still figuring things out in the kitchen considering they are still new. Pricing is expensive for what you are getting and the quality. Service was slow. Definitely has the potential to be much better. This area needs more restaurants so I'm hoping they can figure things out."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves one star as the food here is not tasty at all. We have ordered 2 taco salads, they didn't toss the salad well one had just lettuce and other had rain of tomatoes, corn and no dressing at all, when I told this to a waiter he told its Mexican restaurant and salad here will be like this. The live guacamole was tasteless no salt, lemon and avocado was not fresh. The tacos were tasteless.  Finally ordered churros and ice cream. The churros were soggy and not crisp at all. We paid huge money for this tasteless food. I will never come here again for tasteless food and irresponsible waiters"}
{"text":"Que Onda just opened yesterday... excellent authentic mexican food, great specials and superb service! Beautiful decor and ambiance - so excited to have it near my neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Not excited so far. We tried to go tonight. We were greeted by someone at the chaotic entrance while the 1 hostess was taking payment. He said he would go look for a table for 2 and then went back into the restaurant. There were several empty tables in view inside and out. While we waited he went back into the kitchen for something else, ran a check for a table, and then disappeared. While he was looking, a couple who had come in behind us, another couple was greeted by the hostess and thankfully they were nice and said we were there before them. The hostess asked if we had been greeted and we mentioned that someone was looking for a table for us but had not come back. She then went to look for him and also seemed to disappear. While she was gone from the desk, 1 server came up and said to the other couple that she would be getting the manager for them which she never did (which was fine because they hadn't asked to speak to the manager and were confused about why she had said this), and another said in a friendly manner that someone would be right with us. The other couple gave up, still no hostess, and seated themselves at the bar wishing us luck. Finally, our original greeter was headed back our way when some men who appeared to be friends stopped him to talk to him. Rather than taking a minute to seat the people who had been waiting for him he chose to speak to his friends so we chose to leave. We know it was opening week so we will give this place another chance but as an experienced hostess and server and a local family, this was an awful experience and we had really been looking forward to trying this new restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Que Onda. We had to be in Matthews around dinner time so I yelped local restaurants and Que Onda looked like a good bet. Let me say first of all that this place kind of reminds me of Paco's near Southpark with a slightly different feel. It also bears mentioning that we happened to go on what appears to be the best night of the week as they had $2 tacos and $3 drafts. The tacos were limited as to which ones qualified but the drafts were not as they have 36 to choose from. We started with the appetizer trio. This was cheese dip, pico and guac. All were very good. The salsa they bring you with the chips was curious. It was a dark brown, almost black mildly spicy salsa. I asked for a hotter version and they brought me a habenero (super hot) and a salsa verde (not so hot). I ordered a tinga, braised beef, and carnitas taco. All were tasty but I'd have to say the tinga was my favorite. They offer other non-meat options if you so desire and the kids menu had something for most kids. If you are in the area or definitely if it's a Tuesday, Que Onda will satisfy your taco cravings."}
{"text":"How could anyone give this place less than 5 stars? This food was great. It's one of those places you can say is memorable in all the best ways.  The food was good and the service was on point. Yvette was our server and made sure everything was going well. Danielle the manager/part owner wasn't far behind watching the restaurant run like clockwork. Everything goes smooth when the Boss is watching.  Super, fun, bright, place to get your Mexican Food."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Great food and atmosphere! The manager Alex is amazing! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Mexican food!! The trio amigos is a great appetizer to start with! I I give this place a 10/10!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today after noticing this place while driving by last week. SO GLAD I DID.   They've got some great lunch specials, priced at $9.99. I have half a Torta Cubana (huge) with fries and a cup of their awesome Tortilla Soup. It ticked all the right boxes! The fries were awesome, and had a twice-fried and seasoned quality to them. The soup was warmly spiced, creamy, and had toasted pepitas that really set it off. Perfect for this time of year! The Torta was damn magical. Two words: crispy queso. They literally fry cheese on a flattop. The carnitas/bacon/pickled onions/etc. that was on the Torta was on point. Plenty of balanced flavors there to cut through the fatty sumptuousness of all that pork. Even at half a Torta, it was a large portion!  Bonus for future reference: they've got a lot of taps and solid local options there. The Tequila Library is pretty extensive as well. Solid after-work happy hour place.   Only criticism: this place can be a bit pricey if you stray from specials. $12-$14 for orders of 3 tacos with rice or beans on the side. Most draft beers are $5.50 (but $4 on Thursdays, all day). I could see how a couple coming here for dinner and a few drinks could approach a $100 tab if they're not careful.    All that said, this place is going to be on my rotation!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food great atmosphere.. Friendly wait staff  Best Quesadilla I've ever had , my son had the Cuban my sweetie had the lunch taco special"}
{"text":"Great food and service, was apprehensive about trying based on the reviews but couldn't have been more pleased.  Nice to have authentic Mexican close by. We had tacos, fajitas, gwok and queso with added jalapeños."}
{"text":"The braised beef taco was very juicy & tender. The fried crispy cheese is a no! The cheese dose nothing for the taco. There were a lot of onions & cilantro so if you don't like a lot make sure you ask them to lighten it up!! The Al Pastor is . The pork shoulder is seasoned veru well. The pineapple adds a sweet component to the pork shoulder. The Baja fish taco is average. The fish was not dry & overall was good.  The Mango margaritas was delicious. The bartender did well on the drinks."}
{"text":"I'm a fan and look forward to becoming a regular! I came in with my husband for lunch a week after they opened and I was impressed!  Staff was friendly and polite.  The house salsa was delicious!! And the make everything fresh and in house.  The decor hasn't hanged a ton from the previous tenants which the exception of the dia del muerto decor.... it's cute!  My salad was tasty and fresh.  The dressing was really good.  My husbands chicken taco was good as well.  I can't wait to taste the other taco offerings.  The Jamaica drink is delicious, made with sorrel leaves(hibiscus). And reminds me of my mom.  I'm so happy to have a new place in the neighborhood, with so many tequila options, I can actually crawl home from!"}
{"text":"Had the nachos, flatas and chicken tortilla soup.  The first two were great but the soup was cold and the waitress was no where to be seen.  When she was notified apologies but did not offer to provide hot soup or  take it off bill.    Services is a little lacking."}
{"text":"Que Onda was impressive. I've been to the uptown location and wasn't that satisfied. This location is 2 minutes from home so we have it a second chance. It was way better. Ordered the combination fajitas chicken and shrimp. The only thing I would say is they should remove the tails from the shrimp so I wouldn't have to do it at the table myself. The three amigos app is on point. The veggie tacos were an excellent light dish. Should definitely add crunchy taco shells to the menu for the gluten free customer. Great service. Will be back. - Vernon"}
{"text":"Go check out this spot for quality Mexican. Had the fajitas. Clean friendly prompt service"}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time tonight and we were impressed.  The Service was great as we were seated right away and the waitress was very attentive.  I had the steak fajitas, which were excellent.  Most only complaint was the tortillas are a little on the small side.  My wife really liked the Tacos, again the tortillas are small, which maybe be why they are referred to as Street Tacos.  Overall the food, service, and atmosphere was excellent and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant by far! The staff is super friendly and always have great suggestions, the drinks specials are amazing and their queso is THE bomb! Highly recommend coming here if you're ever wanting to try something new!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican place to have lunch, dinner or just drinks, the bar is stuffed with a lot of great tequilas and the food is also great, the service is amazing, we tried veggie tacos and carnitas tacos, also guacamole and everything is great, good taste and fair prices, it is a must when you are going near Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"Will be a new go-to for street tacos! I've been twice and had a great experience both times. Drinks are great and queso is unique but in a good way"}
{"text":"Gross. Service sad... salsa: literally had more mole than tomato. Refried beans were runny water beans. Margarita was nothing but sour mix @ $12 (it died on the bar for 8 minutes before another server finally took pity on it and broughtbi Would have liked to have a good Mexican spot near home. This is not it. It's full of empty tables for a reason. So disappointing. They obviously spent a ton on decor and none on server training or menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. Ask for the habanero salsa if you can handle it - it's amazing. Braised beef taco was cooked perfectly. The chips and salsa are so good I could have just had those and been happy. Music, ambiance, and decor are all on point. Glad to have a new place to get great food!"}
{"text":"GRAND OPENING of a new location to a spot we go to uptown Charlotte. We love the GUAC and house margaritas. My fav is the spicy jalapeño margarita \"Pepino Pika Pika\" always have taco and tequila specials on Tuesdays. Bring your friends and family it's a great place for kids as well! The staff is all great and extremely friendly, José was excellent and we had a great time at opening!"}
{"text":"First visit and we will definitely be back! Tacos were good, nothing super special but pretty good. The Mercado guacamole was super yummy and was a very generous portion! It's hard to find good Mexican food in Charlotte, but this is a good place to fill your Mexican food craving. Service was pleasant but a little slow."}
{"text":"I tried this place the other night I was very dissatisfied the service was great but the taste of everything I ordered (guacamole, queso, salsa, two chicken Tinga tacos one al pastor rice and beans) was BLAND nothing taste good it all taste store bought or like out of a freezer I won't come back"}
{"text":"OMG! This is easily one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to! I got the tacos for lunch and they were very filling and tasted wonderful! Their salsa is also amazing! I have never had anything like it! Will visit many, many more times!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly mediocre. Salsa didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was from a jar. Pretty sure chips weren't made fresh either. Service was very good and quick.  We tried the chicken, steak and pork tacos. Pork and steak were chewy. Chicken was pretty tasty. Will not return."}
{"text":"We picked up quac and tacos to go and it was spectacular.  My son thought it was the best Mexican in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Service was a tad slow at first but pleasant and responsive. Food is excellent - nice variety, bold, complex flavors and generous portions. A warm, friendly atmosphere Recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food in a mellow neighborhood atmosphere. Good prices and plenty of space for a pleasant meal. Lots of cheap drink specials. Combo fajitas especially good. Excellent selection of street tacos. Good service if somewhat perfunctory. Nice addition to the area across from the Brace Family (formerly Sisley) YMCA. Opened last October and needs support to make it. Worth the ride out Weddington Road!"}
{"text":"So good!!! Amazing salsa. Absolutely out of this world!! I had the Coca-Cola Carnitas- off the hook! Husband really liked the fajitas and cheese quesadillas were above par for my son. We will definitely be back and I hope this place is here to stay!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new to us Mexican Restaurant thats located in the same shopping center as Harris Teeter.  Honesty, I wasn't expecting very much due to the 5 de Mayo Day... however, I was surprised.    We had a small wait for our table (totally expected this) so we cruised to the bar and ordered adult beverages.  Bartenders were friendly and we were able to place our orders quickly.  Plenty of staff on hand behind the bar.   Once we got to the table, Salsa and warm, fresh chips were delivered.  Their salsa is tomato based with corn and had a roasted taste to it. Different but very tasty!   I ordered the Tinga De Pollo street tacos. It came with 3 tacos that had pulled chicken breast, sour cream and cheese.  The plate came with a cup of yellow rice that had carrots and corn and a cup of refried beans. The rice was flavorful but the beans had little to no flavor. The food was better than expect, however I felt that their portions were small for the price.  We also ordered the churros with ice cream. The churros were mushy and were smothered with too much cinnamon sugar.  I believe they were microwaved too much because there was a piece of plastic on the churros.   While the restaurant was busy, our drinks stayed full and our food came out quicker than expected.    The restaurant is not divey at all, nor is it traditional Mexican.  I would categorize this restaurant Americanized-Mexican/trendy. Very casual environment. There's indoor and outdoor seating available.  We sat inside (hello...muggy Spring day in the South!) They have flat screen tvs along the perimeter of the restaurant. The restrooms were very clean! Kid friendly!  Our entire group was satisfied with their food.   I would give this restaurant a 3.5 but since I cant, then 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Okay it is the first week they are open but we waited ten minutes at our table for someone to take our drink order and no chips for us-though we saw quite a few going by.   When we got the chips/salsa they were excellent. I ordered the Cuban sandwich-wasn't a true Cuban had guacamole and the bread wasn't pressed-it was a bun-they should call it Cuban with a twist-it was good just not what I was expecting.  My husband had the chicken mole enchiladas-he thought they were good.   We waited for a box and check. The place has a full bar, big parking lots, lots of tables, and casual dress. We will give this a go again in a few weeks and I'll update the rating if the service gets better."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. What is there not to love? I brought my parents there on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. I would suggest to make a reservation which you can do straight from Yelp (Yay!). Here are some of items that we ordered from our visit.  3 amigos trio: just a little bit of everything. Their guac was pretty good but a little bit citrusy for my liking. Their homemade salsa and chips were amazing and we kept on asking for seconds (which they did not mind giving us at all). pollo en guajillo: it was good but a little bit too much cheese for me to enjoy all of it (I know...who can say too much cheese). skillet fajitas: my parents favorite and gives you your bang for your buck. I was surprised by the size of the portion but no complaints. We loved the flavor and definitely will get it again on our next visit."}
{"text":"Order their guac and you won't be able to talk. My eyes roll back into my head while drool drips at the mere recollection of Que Onda's magnificencia.  Day of the Dead-inspired decor brings life to the ambience, which can best be described as family-friendly hipster eclectic. Welcoming, attentive servers notice small details (water refills, extra silverware needs, etc) and contribute to the place's positive vibes.  Beyond the fiesta, let's focus on the feast. Que Onda's food and drinks (specifically, its tequila) are consistently mind-blowingly and mouth-wateringly incredible. Vegan and pescavegan friendly; I've ordered everything from their veggie tacos to shrimp fajitas--don't forget a side of their unforgettable guacamole--and my dietary needs were always respected. Although I'm blanking on its name, the cheapest tequila ($9) delivered a smoky, sublime flavor.  Their Happy Hour specials alone are reason to return to Charlotte. Me encanta!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at the one in uptown pretty often because I used to work up there so when I found out that they were opening a matthews location, I was super excited. They are one of the few Mexican restaurants that we've been to out here in NC that actually has good salsa. My husband and I are born and raised from CA and were used to eating Mexican food at least 3 times a week. Most of the places out here have salsa that tastes like ketchup. I really like their al pastor tacos in the uptown location. Unfortunately, I don't feel like the matthews location is up to par with the uptown location. Both times I've been here the meat in my tacos have been cold. First time I got the fried fish taco, and two al pastor tacos and today I got a chicken, braised beef, and carnitas taco and they all had luke-warm/cold meat. I'm also not a huge fan of their rice, but that's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Diablos sí!  Matthews was missing a hip Mexican/Spanish restaurant until Que Onda Tacos joined us.   My sister and boyfriend were on their way back to the beach and made a pitstop to see me for lunch. With Tacos ALWAYS on our minds we figured Que Onda would be a perfect place to try out. No reservations were needed for the lunch hour, but I can see this place getting busier in the evenings.   Lunch specials were offered, but nothing appealed to me. As a vegetarian, the staff was able to accommodate my taco order and took the mushrooms out of play. #praise   A solid beer menu, and daily specials. I was feeling the decor and the servers were incredibly friendly and helpful when walking us through the menu.   I do feel like we were forgotten about a few times, but it was lunch and we were the only people in there, so it wasn't a big deal. I'm looking forward to coming here again, but I'll be trying a few more places around the area first. Que Onda wasn't bad, nothing stood out to me making it amazing."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant as it took over the empty space left by another fav restaurant that moved down the street. The outside looks inviting and the inside doesn't disappoint. I ordered to go so I went to the bar. Very friendly staff and a gorgeous bar. Plenty of TVs to watch and a nice open space for people watching as well. The menu is not the greatest layout but I quickly found what I wanted. The food was prepared pretty quickly and I was out the door in less than 20 minutes. The prices are a bit more expensive than I would like but once you see what you get for the money-WELL WORTH IT. I first shared some chips and queso with my wife. The chips were large and clearly pretty fresh/crisp. The queso was homemade and had great bite. I'm a bit boring and love burritos. So I got a chicken one but opted to have it made chimichanga style. WHOLLY DELICIOSO BATMAN. So happy. I can eat a pretty good amount - you know, brought up to eat what I was served, and all that - but I honestly had to stop on this...much to my pleasure (as I now had some for leftovers)! I cannot wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"We live near by and Always come here.. the food is so fresh and simply DELICIOUS!!!!  Also I recommend trying their mojitos... so far I haven't had anything that I didn't like. Plus the service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My new favorite lunch spot in Matthews!! Service and food were amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Well rounded menu.  Tasty salsa and queso dip.  Quesadilla appetizer on spot.   The Pollo En Guajillo Excellent with a side of fried plaintains and a creamy rice that is velvety smooth and tastes wonderful.  My husband had the Mole Enchilada which he gave a hearty thumbs up.  Our dinner mates complimented the enchilada Suiza served with wonderful smooth refried beans and Mexican rice.  Over 20 beers on tap and as many tequilas.  Thank you Shelby for the excellent service!!"}
