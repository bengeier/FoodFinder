{"text":"Okay woah, this place is great! Make sure you try their BBQ pork in one of their dishes, it's super tender. And watch out for their SPICY homemade hot sauce :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! And not to mention the ambience. They've done a wonderful job!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho restaurant you can find in Mississauga! Everything taste like homemade. My favourite is the bun Bo hue. You can't find any restaurant in sauga that's authentic as this one. Even the atmosphere feels like you are in Vietnam (I'm Vietnamese). My husband and I have been regulars (weekly) since everything is so good. Good presentation too! There's even open karaoke there too haha so it's super Vietnamese.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem! Delicious food and friendly staff. I have Vietnamese cuisine often, this restaurant is definitely one of the best. Although I don't live in Mississauga, I will try to come back to this restaurant as much as possible."}
{"text":"We went in not knowing that we had to make a reservation because normally pho restaurants you don't have to. But they accommodated us, service was great. Pho tasted good, it doesn't taste the same as the usual pho place in mississauga, good portion. They even offered to give my son a bowl of pho with noodle and soup for free. We also ordered the appetizer (cha oc chien) which was good also. You prob have to make a reservation if you decide to go there."}
{"text":"New Vietnamese restaurant, opened two months ago.  Lots of vegetarian options and great delicious foods!  Highly recommend this place, and the staff is very nice. A great spot among industrial offices!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 bowls of noodle soup.  One was beef ball noodle soup and the other was Bun Bo Hue.  The broth from both was not very flavorful.  The beef ball soup did not have much beef flavor and tasted sweet when it should be on the salty side.  The beef balls and Cha Lua were the worst that I had ever eaten.  The beef balls were not chewy and the texture of Cha Lua was rough and not smooth.  If it was my first time, I probably would not eat beef balls and Cha Lua again in my lifetime."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga!! My partner and I are absolutely obsessed, we come here regularly. The food is so fresh, and tastes absolutely fabulous. There is just something so humbling about the broths. They taste homemade; without leaving that film on your tongue and need to drink water. The staff are very polite and always always friendly. I love asking for their individual favourites and have really explored the menu. 

Must try:
1. Bun Bo Hue
2. Hu Tieu My Tho
3. Pho
4. Swordfish Ceviche
5. Mussel with Peanuts
6. Homemade hot sauce (very spicy)

Can't wait to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ambiance to boost the experience. A hidden gem in Mississauga yet a great place to experience rich Asian culture. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very good Viet food not just pho and spring roll kinda place. Excellent service, very nice presentations  and quality for the value. Will definitely come back when in the area"}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Service was a bit messed up...came there a couple a weekends ago and had to write this review now think of it...came there as a group of 7 people and ordered all our food at the same time.  When food came out all of us got our food BUT my son, so we ate a little while thinking his would come soon and that his may take some time but guess what...they forgot all about him...he just sat there and stared and these servers walked around so so many times and not even consider why that boy was sitting and looking for his bowl.  So I hurried and turned around and grabbed whichever server walked by and asked where was his food..it has not come for quite a while...server said she will check and never came back (think of that...) so got annoyed and looked up at the cashier bar and must of been the lady owner who saw me and I called her over and asked why so long for my son's food...we are already half way eating. She said ok no worry she go look....and guess what, there was no order....I saw them prancing around at the back asking each other and looking for his food and nothing...poor boy...so she hurriedly got someone to make his order....BUT WE ORDERED TOGETHER....how could they have missed it ??  Anyway, I can see that they were not very efficient in organization.  Just trying out but not going back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place near my hotel!  It was l near an industrial part of the area, so I was not sure how it was going to turn out.  The place is well kept and looked new.  

Service was excellent as I was greeted once I stepped in.  The server recommend a few items for me to try out.  

Food was delicious as I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and pho tai bo vien.  Everything tastes fresh and well prepared.  Tons of herbs and bean sprouts.  They even have speciality hot peppers for your meal that they bring out.

I will absolutely come back tomorrow evening for dinner!  Best place for pho in the Greater Toronto Area that I have tried."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai, pho, deep fried banana and ice cream I've ever had! Everyone is also so friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Our first day in Canada we arrived hungry! We chose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and had good reviews. This is a family owned and run business. The chef is a 5 star chef who decided to stop traveling so much and start a family Vietnamese restaurant. Don't be deceived by the storefront in the industrial neighborhood. The minute you walk in you are met by friendly service, elegant music, and calming decor. 
The waiter helped give us suggestions. Loved the mango salad on rice, spring and egg rolls were fresh and yummy with crisp peanut dipping sauce. Chicken and shrimp pad Thai was a little spicy for my 11 year old but no worries, both my boys filled up on rolls and salad....so more food for me and my husband! I had the meat Pho bowl with side of veggies to put in. The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth and my four year old ate all the meatballs. Loved the fresh flavors of the broth...I'm thinking ginger. For beverages we drank the hot tea they brought and also treated ourselves to a drip coffee, with condensed milk, poured over ice. Thankful for our experience here!"}
{"text":"We had the best Vietnamese experience with great food, awesome service and terrific atmosphere. I want to go back soon with enough people to dine in the bamboo hut!"}
{"text":"You really aren't going to get better Pho anywhere (unless, maybe, you're in Vietnam). This stuff is not just top notch, but it's affordable!
We have been eatting pho for years all over the place but this place wins .
Lots of meat I could not believe how hardy my bowl was .
Great fast friendly serive .
The decor was very nice . Super clean 
I want to go back soon .
We also had Pad Thai and that was good we shared that as a family and everyone loved it .
THIS IS THE PLACE FOR GREAT FOOD ."}
{"text":"Probably the best Vietnamese food I've had in in Canada. Authentic. Big portions. Decent prices. Excellent service.

The bbq chicken and spring roll vermicelli was HUUUUUGGGGGEEE. Comes with some salad, a spring roll, and LOTS of chicken. 

This place is extremely busy for lunch. We had to make reservations a few days before and also order in advance. The servers remembered all the items we ordered and who they were for. The food was ready to be served once we sat down! If you order when you get there, you would have to wait approx. 1 hr to get your food because they are extremely busy. 

Only complaint - takes a VERY LONG TIME TO PAY. Only one cashier and they are extremely slow. Took me around 30 mins to pay for my bill."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the staff is friendly. I am drooling, from just thinking about the food. My favourite dish to order is Mi Dac Biet (dry)."}
{"text":"Wow. Hidden gem alert! If you're looking for delicious Vietnamese food, great service and a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go.

As a vegetarian, I've come to realize there are two kinds of vegetarian menu items. The one that's put there for the odd vegetarian who steps through the door with non-veggie friends, and the other, by chefs who are actually interested in creating dishes without meat. This spot belongs in the latter category.

It's clear from the menu options that they thought about different kinds of vegetarian foods. There's a range of soupy and dry items, like spicy vegetable noodles in lemongrass soup or peanuts, bitter melon and rice. On top of variety, my order of the lemongrass soup's ratio of noodle to tofu and veggies was well balanced, making it a hearty meal, whereas I find myself often with a big bowl of plain noodles and soup in many other restaurants after a certain point.  

I also loved the noodle choice with the soup. The texture was fuller than the usual flat vermicelli noodles and made it a great combo.  Ughhhh, so scrumptious! This is also a spot that doesn't cheap out on sprouts and basil, and my noodles came with special fixings as well---purple cabbage, which not included in my partner's beef pho. The only thing that was not a standout for me are the spring rolls. Otherwise, service was amazing too. There seemed to have been a hostess who came around and checked up on folks throughout their meal, really elevating the dining experience. 

In short, this is a must-try for vegetarians and I look forward to trying more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho places I've ever been to!  The food is so legit, and the restaurant is owned by Vietnamese people so the flavour of the dishes and menu selection are very authentic!  I also totally dig the tacky but oh-so-Fun decor...with the fake trees and fake/real wooden elements!  Service is always very friendly and helpful!  I don't know what my fave noodle dish is called because it's in viet, but it's basically a special sweet and spicy hue noodle soup with seafood.  And spring rolls are also amaze balls!  You would have never known from the outside because this place is sort of in the middle of all these empty-looking plazas - it's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Same rating for my second time here - a solid four stars. The customer service, albeit slow, is impeccable. The owner, Tinh, comes by personally to check on you to see if you're comfortably seated and well fed.

This time I ordered the bun goi gia, a slightly sour tamarind broth with bun, pork belly, Vietnamese sausage, and three big prawns. There was also a decent and healthy serving of herbs and veggies. The bun was good - the flavour was light and fairly delicate. The fried onions and peanuts added a bit more jazz to the whole dish and accentuated its flavour. For those more accustomed to heavier flavours, this may not be your preferred choice, but if you're searching for a lighter fare, try this out!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a warehouse sale and found this wonderful viet restaurant using Yelp, I love Yelp!

This place deserves 5 stars in all aspects: food, service  ambience, value.

The noodles were aromatic and tasty, great spring rolls and absolutely enjoyed the fried bananas.  They are pressed, fried to a perfect non greasy crisp, with a drizzle of honey.

Service was great and attentive.  Special requests such as no blood jello on the bun bo hue, and cooked bean sprouts were accommodated. 

Location wise, it is in more of an industrial area, but step inside and it transports you to Vietnam.  Nice authentic looking decor that you wouldn't expect based on the exterior of the restaurant. 

Would definitely come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews and also because it's so close to my office. I thought i had found a new, convenient hidden gem... But boy, was i disappointed! I tried the house special pho and bun bo hue and both were mediocre at best. The broth for both contained so much MSG that my tongue was tingly for the rest of the afternoon. The broth was oversweetened and tasted like sugar, rather than being natural sweet from bones or daikon. I think it's an OK place for the lunch crowd but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here for a legit meal."}
{"text":"It's out of the way and hidden, but if you're driving and nearby, it's totally worth it. The spicy beef stew with noodles was good. The chicken bûn too. The fresh sprring rolld were fantastic."}
{"text":"wow, I was Looking for an authentic Vietnamese place where to have some Pho and I stumbled upon this restaurant tucked away in an industrial area of Mississauga.  The ambiance and becoming atmosphere grab you the minute you enter the door.  The service is great from the second I stepped into the restaurant till the time I left.  

Since I was not too hungry I decided on a light fare which was fish device and a traditional pho.  The fish device was outstanding ... there must be a secret to the preparation which I did not ask for.  The fish was exquisitely tender and the flavors simply rich and complex.  With every bite more flavors were discovered.

While the pho looked just as any other Pho the broth was spectacularly rich.  The rich flavor of the ox bone was subtle and enriching.  Perhaps the best best beef broth I have ever had.

On a side note the washroom was impeccably clean unlike many restaurants in which I usually find them to be clean at best."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem for me anyways!!  Smells delish the moment you walk in.  Clean and welcoming restaurant!  Food was fairly priced and tasted amazing...I had the Bbq pork and chicken with broken rice and fresh yummy Viet Spring rolls!!  Try it!!  You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in an industrial area of Mississauga but it is well worth finding. Upon first glance you might be reluctant but don't let the outside fool you! It's beautifully decorated on the inside.

The food here is amazing, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho and vermicelli with chicken and spring roll. There is something for everyone and their appetizers are great too. Food is very authentic! Chef does an amazing job with the quality.

Service is very good, owner will often times come around and talk to the customers which makes it very genuine and very sweet of her to.

Would I come back again? Absolutely! My boyfriend says it's probably the best in the GTA. Good price, great quality and fantastic service :)"}
{"text":"We were a bit skeptical with the location, but we walked into the restaurant and were pleasantly surprised!  The pho is delicious! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  

Great service. Quick and friendly. Most importantly delicious & fresh. Thanks so much Kevin for the continued wonderful service. Our daughter comes home from University wanting to come here ASAP!"}
{"text":"We came again for a Good Friday meal instead of going to a Fish and Chips restaurant. This place is still solid and the dishes are still delicious. I went with the Shrimp Pad Thai for the meatless Friday. 

The service still top notch and attentive. Just a note that when you ask for cold water, they will bring you cucumbers water. Some people might not like that so make sure to ask for tap water.

{"text":"This restaurant has amazing food.when we first got there they set us to sit to the far right of when you first come in..then they told us to move because they had to clean but other people where sitting in the area and were not asked to clean.We asked for forks and they only brought out one.we also asked for water and they only brought out one glass for us to share between two people.overall ilthd food was great and it smelled very clean."}
{"text":"Nothing I can say. You just need to go. Really the best Vietnamese food. Any very reasonable prices. I just love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. 
I agree it's in a weird area for a restaurant but well worth it once you find it."}
{"text":"Unusual location, but loved the interior decor. It warm and inviting and the staff is super friendly. The food was good, the service was even better. Their Pho was tasty, but their special summer rolls (forgot their exact name) were fantastic. I was not a fan of the breadfruit salad. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"This was a real awesome experience. They have such nice decor, really clean, nice atmosphere. It gets really busy but we were able to get a table of nine for my birthday. I received a free dessert which was AMAZING. The staff were very well dressed and professional, the food came out quickly and was very tasty. I got a large special pho and they PACKED it with meat. They were not cheap. 

I'm not from Ontario but I will definitely come back to this place if I can. It was great."}
{"text":"All I really order at a Vietnamese restaurant is pork bbq with vermicelli and spring rolls. And this one was just as tasty. The bbq wasn't as sweet as other places and the pork was tender. They give a good amount just for lunch so you're satisfied. The pho was tasty, but I found it more salty than other places. Will be back if I'm ever in the area. And don't let the location fool you, this place is busy!"}
{"text":"We have been this restaurant 3 times food is good in grand opening and last week we come back for the dinner with karaoke and dancing night it make my group disappointed the food they cut off the meat And sea food
It tasted like vegetables especially pat THAI noodles no meat at all. The music is nice but view to see the karaoke is blocked by big post in the middle of the karaoke room can't see at all .
We hope this restaurant don't change the way they cook ."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp when driving from Collingwood back to the city. Seeing as my family loves bun cha, it was an instant decision to try somewhere new for a quick bite to eat. Pho Ngoc exceeded my expectations in every way. The cool tiki decor reminded me of the eclectic style of late night eats places in Vietnam. The bun cha goi came with bbq pork that was tender and plentiful, and the house chilli sauce had a great kick to compliment it. And, the spring rolls were grilled and not fried, so less greasy. And, the fresh rolls came with what tasted like a homemade peanut sauce that wasn't overly sweet. I wish I was closer to this joint, and may even make the drive from downtown to visit again!"}
{"text":"Another successful Yelp discovery! 

This Vietnamese restaurant is in an industrial park and you would never think to come here if not for someone telling you. That being said, it is very busy during lunch hour and there is a ton of people picking up takeout as well.

I had the vermicelli (bun) which was the skinny vermicelli, which is the best, not the medium thickness. The fish sauce was tasty and not overbearing, and most importantly the BBQ was grilled perfectly. There was also ample cucumbers, carrots and pickled radish. All in all this is definitely a (not so) hidden gem!"}
{"text":"As a vietnamese person who is keen on comfort asian food, i would have to say the dishes here are authentic. The area is industrial and so this pho restaurant was perfect for nearby comfort food. Price is good, service is good, interor decor is really nice although i have yet to dine in. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a little pho gem in such an industrial area! Upon walking in the owner greeted us with such a friendly smile and attitude! The restaurant is quite big with many big tables as well. 

Menu is quite generic as any other pho joint but we had to try their house special pho and the grilled chicken and spring roll bun (vermicilli) 

Pho was great in price. Started around 8 something for a small then up a dollar as the size went up. The meat to noodle ratio was very very generous. I think this is the first pho place I've been too where I thought I had too much meat(in a good way!!)! The broth was sooo flavourful and delicious. And the noodles were just the right amount. They also have 2 kinds of home made chilli if you're feeling more adventurous instead of having the good ol siracha!

Hubby had the vermicelli and once again... the chicken was so generous in portion size! Grilled very nicely and was hot from the grill! The spring roll looked a little different from your usual.. not sure if it is made from soya bean wrap? But nonetheless it tasted Delish!!

We ended with an iced drip viet coffee with condense milk to go and it was sooo good. The brew of the coffee was strong! Not watered down nor did it taste extra bitter. I was so satisfied to have this sweet treat at the end.

Overall an amazing experience. Fast and geeat service, clean environment and delicious viet food!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  Everyone working here is so nice.  Great food.  I had the Bun Bo Hue and my girlfriend had the grilled chicken and spring roll with vermicelli.  Both were delicious.  Portions and prices were great too.  We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I stopped in here last week.  First off upon walking in you are taken back by the great decor because it makes you feel like you are dining in Vietnam.  It is very authentic!  

For dinner I ordered the vermicelli grilled chicken with spring roll and a tandarin drink.  The grilled chicken was excellent!  The chicken was seasoned perfectly.  The spring roll which was pork and shrimp tasted superb.  I never had a tandarin drink before but the owner recommended it.  Even though I could not finish it because it was such a large cup, it too was excellent and very unique tasting.  It's not something that I would usually order (or even something I knew existed) but it was great tasting.

The staff is excellent.  There is nothing I can say except they are perfect!  They were engaging, talkative, and helpful.

I would definitely go back next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"An awesome restaurant. The food here cheered me up before my 16 hr flight to Hong Kong. Will surely come back after flight at YYZ airport."}
{"text":"After trying a few more items, like their My Tho style vegetarian soup, the vegetarian spring rolls, mock meat with vermicelli, etc, I have to admit that this place is excellent.  

The service is very good (especially for a pho place) and the flavours are authentic.  It is not like the chain pho restaurants where they use tons of MSG to add to the flavour of their foods.  You can tell everything is freshly made.  Sure, the food may take 10 minutes to come out instead of the normal 5 minutes for pho, but when the quality is so much better, it's definitely worth the wait.  

If you are vegan and vegetarian, they are very willing to accommodate dietary restrictions.  While their pad thai is not vegan, I asked and they said they could make it without eggs, which is something you probably won't get at the chain pho places.  

I've also recommended a few people to come here and come with non-vegan dining companions and they've all said their meat dishes were delicious. 

My recommendation: My Tho style vegetarian broth with clear noodles (for something healthy and not so spicy) and then for a treat, the vegetarian bun bo hue (very spicy and flavourful)."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho restaurant I've been to in Toronto! The decor, food, service was top notch. The interior was very cute and nicely thought out, and the appetizers were very nicely presented. We also wanted to surprise our friend for her birthday and they were very nice to accommodate us. I especially enjoyed the matcha tea with grass jelly and chia, really good flavor and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"To say the food is very good does not do justice to the the dishes being truly sumptuous and delicious, you should experience for yourself. Attention to detail in food presentation worthy of that instagram shot. You need a bit of time to admire and to take that photo. Not to mention the beautiful interior that takes you to the tropics or \"home\", with accompaniment of nostalgic music and now holiday jingles. Staff goes above and beyond in food and service. You could leave them to co-host your party. You are in good hands. Impeccable service! The whole dining experience satisfy all 5 senses - sight, sound, smell, taste and the overall feeling. Pho Ngoc Yen lives up to their statement of giving that lasting feeling of being very satisfied after the meal. You would talk and think about it all day long or until your next visit."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice service. Seems clean and well-run. Our table order Ph (of course), the vegetarian bún bò, a vermicelli dish and another dish. To finish, we tried the fried banana. We were a bit skeptical but it was delicious- somewhat reminiscent of the ubiquitous beignet, but different. It's not the most quiet restaurant but the ambiance is still quite nice. This was our 1st visit and we look forward to subsequent meals there."}
{"text":"This place was honestly amazing.  We have been on the search for a new pho place for our trips to Toronto since our favorite place closed, and I think we have found it!  Service was very attentive, and food came out exceptionally fast. We were packing our leftovers for a long drive and didn't want our noodles to break down in the soup; they were accommodating with extra containers to separate our broth out, and even provided bottled water for the road.

There were several items on their evening menu that I haven't seen at other pho joints; we tried the cha oc chien (the menu calls them pork and snail pancakes which caused some confusion, but these are great flavorful sausages with a unique ginger sauce).  The shredded pork summer rolls were also new for us, and I loved the texture of the dry spiced pork.  

The main thing we are always looking for is a good balance of flavor in the pho broth,  and they definitely delivered.  My only slight disappointment is that the variety of meat cuts available in the pho dac viet was more limited than many restaurants, but it was definitely made up for with great portions and quality of the protein available.  We will definitely return and recommend when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The rolls were amazing!!! The presentation was amazing for a pho place. It's different. I will only come here from now on for pho."}
{"text":"I'm from California, here visiting families, stopped by for lunch. I ordered the Bùn Bo Hue it was really good. The service was very nice."}
{"text":"Damn!! This place was fantastic, fresh and delicious food. We brought my mom here (she was skeptical as most moms...haha!), it was her first time trying Vietnamese food and she loved it! Excellent hospitality and service, a great place for a fam jam and/or for couples. They only use beef or chicken broth in their pho which is awesome as most spots tend to use pork. Definitely our go-to place in Mississauga.

A critique? Location is a bit of a drive - just like most spots in the burbs."}
{"text":"Fresh Vietnamese Food. Love that they have both vegan options and meat options so everyone's happy. Quality meals and delicious broths. On point"}
{"text":"Pho Ngoc Yen is a new family run and operated Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga. It's located in an industrial area of Mississauga and you wouldn't be able to find it unless you were specifically looking for it but if you are looking for good authentic Vietnamese food, the location shouldn't deter you from going because it's worth the drive.

It's a beautiful restaurant with a really nice decor and very spacious in comparison to your typical Vietnamese restaurant and can accommodate large parties.

The deep fried spring rolls (2 for $5 plus tax) had a nice presentation. The deep fried spring rolls were good but not great, outside skin was a little overcocoked and didn't have the light bubbly outside which is my preference. The inside of the spring rolls were good, nice texture and right balance of taro with the other ingredients.

The Pho Ngoc Yen Dac Biet ($9.50 plus tax for a medium) which is essentially the house special was really good and definitely one of the best in Mississauga. Perfectly cooked noodles, good quality of beef, beef balls and most importantly a really good broth.

The Bun Bo Hue ($9 plus tax one size only) which is essentially beef, pork with vermicelli in a spicy lemongrass soup. The Bun Bo Hue was pretty good, really hard to find good authentic Bun Bo Hue in Mississauga. Perfectly cooked noodles, nice spicy broth but not too spicy and good quality of beef and pork and cubes of pork blood.

Overall, really good and authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga, definitely one of the best. Really good food that's reasonably priced, great friendly service, nice decor, ambience and very clean."}
{"text":"Whenever we are around the airport, we generally head to one of the big chain resto-bars in the area to eat just because it's a reliable choice. I was bored with the selection and stumbled upon the reviews of this great little spot. Were the reviews too good to be true? Great food in an industrial area?!

We went on a gloomy Sunday afternoon and the parking lot was packed for this place literally in the middle of nowhere. That was good sign #1. Good sign #2 was the delicious aroma that came wafting out the front door as we entered. Good sign #3 was that it was very clean and did not have the typical utilitarian decor of most dated Viet-pho joints. You can tell the place is a labour of love.

The friendly staff served us promptly. I had the Vermicelli with grilled chicken, pork, and a spring roll while my partner had with com tam (broken rice) with grilled pork, chicken, and a fried egg. Both were typical dishes prepared well. The ingredients were fresh and I loved the garlicky goodness of the grilled meats. We were curious about the pho but neither of us were in the mood for a whole bowl so our server was kind enough to offer a small bowl of their broth to try with our meal. It was really tasty and I would definitely love to try one of their soups next time I'm there. Overall great value for really good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Amazing! They were so kind and treated us like family! The food portions were very generous (biggest we've seen)! At the end of our meal they offered us two cold and refreshing drinks on the house.

I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"When i was driving to this location I thought I am being misled, well thats not the case. Its industrial area but there is a vaitamese gem In that cluttered area.  Restaurant is beautiful from inside.  Staff was so friendly, food was awesome. Menu was devided into pho,  appitizer, vegitables, spring rolls, pad thai and BBQ.  I would go for pad thai, chicken and shrimp, also i would go for pho with chicken and BBQ chicken.  Its not expensive, infact the dinning experience is amazing. It has a small stage which could be used in booking for events. Btw when we entered we were the only non vaitamese in the restaurant and that talks about the food."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in the industrial area of Mississauga. The restaurant is decorated with the 1800's theme that's a bit tacky but neat. The restaurant is pretty big and have 2 tikki booths for larger parties. It looks like a good place to hold private parties as well.

Service was great. The food portions and menu items have more unique items compared to other pho restaurants. The crowd I went with agreed that this place has more noodles and ingredients than pho 99 and around the same price point.  The soup base was authentic and tasty. 

I would go here more often if it was closer!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST viet restaurant in Mississauga. Food, presentation and service has been great!  Definitely should be on everyone's must try list."}
{"text":"I chose this place for my welcome lunch since my workplace is not too far from here. The location of this place is in an industrial lot with other stores/fixer upper/workshops here. They have renovated very nicely here and it is definitely a new guy in this area. The owners have placed a sign on the main directory board, along with a fold-up metal sandwich board..Guess a lot of people have also missed this. 

The waiters/hostess here are very hospitable - we didn't have a reservation the 2nd time going and there was ample seating around 11:45AM. The decor is a million times better than the pho restaurants you're used to seeing (looking at you, Train) 

The menus were already on the tables when we arrived, along with cutlery. Waiter will come to ask you if you'd like tea or water. The restaurant was about 70% full for the lunch hour rush, and 50% full the 2nd time I went. 

Menu includes items such as: fried rice, pho, bun, egg noodles, com tam (broken rice), pad thai. They have the title of the dish in Vietnamese, along with the description in English. I ordered their special pho and it came with slices of rare shank meat, beef balls with rice noodles. **If you add the spring roll to the dish, you will get a full order of their spring rolls** I didn't mind, but was just trying to reduce the strength of itis I'd get post-meal. 

Drinks off the top of my head include: wine, beers, and Vietnamese coffee

My coworkers got an assortment of fried rice, noodles, mango salad and pho - we really enjoy this place and will prob be back a few more times before the summer ends.

They've got little tropical huts for group seating and a karaoke bar!! They accept debit, and credit over $10"}
{"text":"The place is right besides my dad's stairs company so easy choice. Plus my whole fanily was sooo excited about the interior being so unique and authentic. 

Went here as part of a holiday gathering, and was impressed by the reservations and greetings. 

Menu was extensive with specialties 

Tried the vegetarian bun bo hue and spring rolls...the chay bun bo hue wasnt as good as two other places ive been to. 

The veggie spring rolls on the other hand was crispy, delicious and great filling!

DCs ordered pho, pad thai, rice dishes and meat spring rolls. 

Stand outs were:

their rice dishes, authentic short grain rice

Pho was flavorful and good portions of meat

Pad thais were not great- soggy with no flavor and not much in terms of ingredients 

Presentation was really good for everything, cute little baskets and banana leaves."}
{"text":"Pho Ngoc Yen is a good vietnamese restaurant. As many others have said, it is in the industrial area of Mississauga so it is rather out of the way. I'm just not sure whether or not I would come here when there is Pho 99 (which is cheaper and tastier). I liked the food here but I just wasn't blown away by it as I expected by the stellar ratings for this place. That being said Pho Ngoc Yen is a welcome addition to the Mississauga Vietnamese restaurant scene.

The decor is really odd with a tropical theme and it was somewhat dimly lit. Service was fine for the most part.

We had the house special pho and it was really good. The broth was flavorful and the portions were adequate but I found that the beansprouts, and mint could have been more fresh.

My favourite dish here was actually not the  pho but their broken rice dishes!  Actual broken rice is somewhat of a rarity here so it was such a pleasant surprise and speaks true to the authenticity of this restaurant. The rice was amazing; it was fluffy, loose, and incredibly fragrant. The meat was grilled well but was bit skimpy. The spring rolls were hot and fresh but I prefer the extra crispy yellow ones at Pho 99 which has a lighter yet more satisfying crunch to them. The filling also somewhat lacking."}
{"text":"We took my (soon to be) mother in law here with my fiance's family for a belated birthday celebration and really enjoyed the food/atmosphere.

As other reviewers have noted, the restaurant is located in a random industrial parking lot. Not deterred and fueled by raving Yelp reviews, we drove here on a drizzly Sunday evening. As soon as we opened the door and were greeted with an intoxicating/delicious food smell (plus it was super busy!), we knew we had come to the right place.

To start, we ordered a few items to share from the appetizer menu. We tried the fresh spring rolls with shrimp, fried spring rolls, wonton soup, and mango salad. Everything was super delicious, tasted fresh and made with care. To accompany these nibbles, we enjoyed many different home made sauces including a killer hot sauce - yum!

Service was a bit confused - they have a lot of people working and we weren't really sure who our server was but we didn't go without anything we needed for long. Perhaps just some hiccups they are working out as they just opened in June.

For our mains, we each ordered one dish and shared with everyone at the table. We got an order of Pad Thai with shrimp, crispy seafood noodles, spicy veggie pho, veggie vermacelli, and my bae opted for the pork/chicken vermacelli. Again, flavours were awesome and all of dishes were so tasty. I want to come back and try the regular veggie pho!

Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't pass up the deep fried bananas and also ordered two scoops of ice cream - red bean and mango. I took bites of the hot crispy sweet bananas with the cold ice cream and was in dessert heaven. Oh so good!

Since my MIL loves loves loves spicy foods, the hostess (I think she might be the owner) was kind enough to send home a container of their house made hot sauce just for her. I love when restaurants go out of their way with a small touch, it really made my MIL feel so special - thank you!!! We also were handed delicious honey (?) covered fried balls which were stuffed with bean (or cheese?) - either way, they were epic!

Absolutely would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for Vietnamese fantastic food!"}
{"text":"I've only had the pad thai here and it was a very good one. So good in fact, we came back the next day to have it again (which I never do). Table service was great and I'd love to come back however, of the 4 times I've been here cashing out is INCREDIBLY SLOW! So much so I can't go back until I see some more positive reviews. 

Cashing out brought down the rating but the pad thai I had was a 5 star. If you don't mind the INCREDIBLY SLOW cashier, go try:)"}
{"text":"This is used to be Ellen's Place, a Filipino restaurant. I mostly love their food especially their Pho. Love their ambiance too. Can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"J'étais au Double Tree sur Dixie rd et avais le goût d'une PHO... celui-ci était a 1km belle marche...
Dans un parc industriel je croyais m'être trompé...
Oh que non... beau Resto service impeccable et la PHO... plus qu'excellente...
Je vous recommande fortement"}
{"text":"This place is located in a complex that is hidden in plain view. Definitely does not seem like there would be a restaurant there but somehow it is busier than i expected.

The food feels more fusion but my vietnamese friend said the chef specials were more authentic than the other items and she was born and raised in Saigon. So she must know what shes talking about.

The decor felt like Saigon and the whole atmosphere is intended to give the classy Saigon restaurant feel which is nice.

We ordered the beef cerviche and curry squid. I thought the beef ceviche was done nicely but the curry squid had these pieces of ginger that I'd mistaken for some vegetable or something and end up spitting it out. I like to eat my dish in its entirety but the ginger really ruined it. 

The presentation was also fantastic. Makes you not want to eat it at first but hunger will soon grab hold. 

I definitely recommend the place. Great overall experience."}
{"text":"Guess I forgot to review this place. I have been here 3 times now.  We refer to this place as the high end pho place lol.  Inside is very nice and clean, and the bowls, utensils etc, you notice right away it is different than most pho place you have been to.  The way it is set up, it seems like a good spot for a small party/gathering.  There is also a small stage, I don't know, maybe they have karaoke night or something?  Service is always great and friendly.

The location is in more of a business area than residential,. But that being said, everytime we have gone, on weekends for lunch, there are plenty of customers.  Wouldn't be surprised if lunch during the week is extremely busy due to all the businesses around.  

My go to anywhere is the beef ball and rare beef. I have not tried  other items yet other than pho,  their pho/broth is just amazing!  I always put hot sauce in mine, and any other place, the broth does not take much to turn red, and at times too spicy hot to drink the broth afterwards. Not here, you barely notice any red, and I can still enjoy the broth at the end.  Prices seems pretty much on par with other places, and you get plenty of food. Value is definitely very good just like everything else."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. This is the one. If you like Vietnamese food. This is by far the best in Mississauga. I tried the noodle soups and pork roll. the taste of the soup are delicious. I know many other restaurants use powder but this one tastes better."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for service. Was there again and ordered the wrong rolls. Instead of taking them back the waitress said that I'd have to pay for additional rolls. What great service guys :("}
{"text":"Visited this place with Family, great ambience plenty of options for people looking for Authentic Vietnamese food. Food is very tasty, I also found this place very neat almost a fine dine experience. Seating space is limited but good for small group of family/friends. Staff seems to be busy, little to no interaction with customers. There is live music available, however can't say anything about that as it was not functional. Overall great dine-in, highly recommended for formal dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation a while back. I ordered the house special pho with rare beef and beef balls and rice noodles. The broth was very flavourful that didn't need much additional condiments beyond some mint leaves , sprouts and a small dash of sirracha. The menu was short and well layed out. From my first experience, quality over quantity, which I love. The menu items were very well priced. The service was prompt and courteous. Quiet enough so if you're with company you can have a conversation without yelling. A hidden gem in industrial Mississauga. I'm definitely coming back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"The worst service I've had in a decade. No interest in seating us, taking our order, or delivering a drink in over an hour. We did not even exist for 60 minutes. I've eaten here for lunch before, and the food is excellent, but Saturday night dinner was an epic fail. I told my buddy how great this place was only to have fried egg on my face. We walked out after feeling like chumps for sitting around as long as we did. Lunch only--unless you are a large Vietnamese family, then you have a shot at getting an order. Waitress was either incompetent or indifferent. Will not return."}
{"text":"This poor star rating is mostly for service and I'm really sorry to do it because the people were super nice but it seemed like they were confused as to how a restaurant should be run. I know that sounds super mean but hear me out. 

So I came here with my parents on a Saturday evening and of course it was full. The hostess looked very flustered and told us that we may have to wait for a while which is expected--but she pointed at a table and said that they were almost done and told us it would take 20 more min which seems like an awful long time for a table to wrap up. What she unintentionally meant was that it would take forever for a table to be cleaned up after customers have left. For a full house, you would think they want to open up a table quickly for turnover because they would get more $$. 

So anyhow we waited a good 30min before we got our table, but while we waited, the hostess kept turning people down telling them that it would take an hour until they could get tables! I mean sure tell them how long it would take, but to tell them to come back another time? It was really weird to me, shouldn't that be up to the customers? She just told them to take a business card and come back another time. 

As we waited for our table, we looked at the takeout menu to see what we should order, because I had a sneaking suspicion that it would take a while for a server or our food to come. I was right, both happened. A very confused looking server slowly approached us asking if we needed menus, of course we do! And when she brought our tea I immediately ordered. 30-40min later our food came when it should not have taken so long. We only ordered 3 noodle soups. Other tables were getting their food faster even though they ordered later. The waitress did acknowledge how long the food was taking and gave us sweet/salty peanuts while we waited. She was lucky none of us were too hungry. 

I mean it wasn't terrible service but it was just very confusing and I felt not very professional. The food was alright. I'd have to go again maybe during a less busy time of the day so that all the delays wouldn't happen again. I'll give this place another try another time."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough! I have had pho almost everywhere in mississauga and  I have to say that this place probably has the best tasting pho broth and Bún bò Hu broth in Mississauga! Its very rich in flavours :)"}
{"text":"Just had a large family dinner here and the food and service was phenomenal! We tried the mussels, calimari, and spring rolls for appetizers. Many of us tried different types of pho, one tried the fried rice with pork, and one had the pad thai. Awesome!!! Wish I was more eloquent with words but a must try if you are in town. It was a great last meal for our family vacation. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's a must-go to hidden gem. The food is made fresh, feels healthy. Massive potions. A tropical decor vibe, the hostesses are in traditional Vietnamese ao Dai. Very elegant, friendly staff. They do Karaoke on weekends as well. Would visit this location again to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a GEM....I travel a lot, so I'm always in restaurant. The best way to find good restaurants is to look on Yelp 
This is one of the best experiences that I had for a long time service and the food. Do not let the building discourage you, yes it is in a industrial park...you are at the right place"}
{"text":"A hidden gem like what everyone else says it is. A very authentic feeling and their teas that they serve up is actually really good. I believe it was jasmine tea. I had their chicken steak on rice and compared to like pho 99, the chicken they use is less fatty but can be just as tender. 

Prices are competitively comparable to like the chain stores you see in the city. This place is located in a deep corner in the industrial zones so it can be hard to locate and generally speaking no one would know this place even exists. Until Yelp came along and showed up as one of the places to try out!

I would give this place a try again and perhaps order some other dishes. I also ordered their deep fried spring rolls and also comparatively, it was just as good as well. 

Staff are very friendly - I think it is probably family owned as well so they are very tentative to the customers and you get a genuine feel for their care for you."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Hidden gem of Mississauga. The place is hidden and in a shock industrial area. Of all places, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Amazing food - tastes homemade and authentic. You can tell they put their heart and soul into the dishes.  The service is fantastic - will come back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I typically don't write many reviews but this place was delicious. My family came to try out their hotpot and some very unique appetizers such as the fish ceviche (viet style) and beef with grape leaves. The people there are so generous and accommodating.  I can't wait to try their other dishes the next time I am able to one to visit!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends on an icy Saturday night, and although the restaurant was not full due to the inclement weather, we were so happy we braved the slippery roads to get there. Service was very attentive and we had no sooner received our starters, when our mains came out. (if I were to offer a suggestion to the restaurant, it would be to wait a bit for diners to enjoy their appetizers before serving the main dishes) speediness aside, I would highly recommend the mango salad and the fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls. Both incredibly fresh and flavourful. Fried calamari were done perfectly , and were not rubbery or too chewy. Dipping sauce for calamari was especially great. My shrimp pad Thai was delicious and full of veggies, noodles, sprouts and shrimp. Fried pork with rice was also excellent. Others had the vegetarian pho soup grilled chicken with rice, and were not disappointed. Food is made fresh to order and be warned that portions are huge. My pad Thai alone could have easily fed at least two others after we had appetizers. Hope to come back soon to try more items on the menu. Overall, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My new fav spot! I barely go out for Vietnamese food but this place is definitely worth it. We were a group of 7 who head there for a girls night out. We ordered veggie spring rolls for the table which were yummy. Crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside with tons of veggie filling. For mains, most of us ordered the Bun Bo Hui Chay (rice noodles in spicy lemongrass soup - veggie broth with mock meat and tofu) which was absolutely delicious! Tons of flavours and not too salty like many broths, or ramen. One of us ordered the shrimp and chicken pad Thai and that was good too. Enjoyed their service too.. friendly and attentive, even though they were quite busy for a Saturday night. Reasonably priced with huge portion sizes - so great for large groups/big fams. You know the place is legit when you see tons of Vietnamese folks eating there!!! Bonus: lots of free parking in the plaza. Definitely a hidden gem in that industrial area! Must try!"}
{"text":"i'll write a more comprehensive review after trying more items here, but i must say... this place has absolutely ruined bun bo hue (bbh) for me, possibly forever.  this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, but the bbh at chain vietnamese restaurants tastes like water compared to pho ngoc yen's.  here, their broth is loaded what i think are dried shrimp flakes (which took me a bit to warm up to, but are truly delicious) and a potent lemongrass flavour, both which really set the broth apart from other restaurants' bbh tbh.  the dish contains the usual suspects (beef brisket, sausage, blood cubes) but in quantities higher than other restaurants, further making the case that you absolutely need to try it.

service is good, and the decor is akin to some sort of wooden hut.  some mississaugans may remember ellen's filipino karaoke bar which used to occupy this space, and it's interesting to note that pho ngoc yen did not change the decor at all after taking over."}
{"text":"This place is ok. 

It's a bit out of the way and located down a dark street in an industrial park near the airport.

It doesn't look like your typical Vietnamese Pho place, but not upscale either.

The service is pleasant and we were in and out within a half hour, which was more than enough time for us to eat and for me to drop my partner off at the airport for his flight to LV. 

The pho broth is good, but it tastes more clear in comparison to the other pho places. 

We, also, ordered the vietnamese spring rolls, which were ok.

Overall - this place is ok - but not particularly noteworthy and I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here for a meal if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Quite the experience.
You begin your visit with a charming atmosphere and a warm welcome.
The people and services authentic kind and prompt.
The food it self has amazing flavor is beautifully presented and comes out fast. 
The coffee to die for and a perfect way to end you visit.
I want to take a trip to this area soon just to visit.
I defiantly recommend stoping by your self!"}
{"text":"Best place for Vietnamese food in the Mississauga/ Brampton area. The customer service is great, the food is presented well and the quality of the food tastes great!

It's great for a date spot or a family outing."}
{"text":"I come here for the veggie bun bo hue as vegan. It's pretty good but there is better. Can't say anything about the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! The Pho, rolls and fried banana were great and I'll make an effort to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Great food and restaurant. The owner was very nice and came to our table a couple of times just to ask how we liked the food. Also the service was outstanding. Will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant- food was fresh and delicious; very flavorful and served quickly.

Their location is a bit challenging. Parking is scarce around the building. The interior and decor are nice. I had one complaint - the chairs are a bit too low for the tables! I felt as if I were sitting at the kids' table at a family gathering :)"}
{"text":"Simply put...the BEST Vietnamese food I've ever had in my life!! You MUST eat at this restaurant!! The food is outrageously good. The service staff (our server was Tin) was polite & dedicated to providing great service. And to top it all off...the Fried Banana is beyond delicious! The food, the service, the location...all fantastic! We're going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is def a hidden gem. It's located in an oddly industrial area, but the inside is beautifully decorated to contrast the surrounding buildings. The menu is smaller than most places, but the food is delicious. I had the bún bò hu (B8), and found the lemongrass broth to be much richer (and much less watered down) than other Vietnamese joints in the city. It was delicious, though I would've liked it a bit spicier. My boyfriend had the NY special (P1), and he said the broth was very flavourful and the beef portions generous and more lean, which is what he preferred. The prices were reasonable; everything was $10-12, excluding drinks. The people working there were welcoming and happy to answer any questions we had about their dishes and they'd recommend. They seem a little understaffed, but they were attentive and kind even though they seemed busy. Overall, I'd love to come back!"}
{"text":"Completely unexpected!!! Right in the middle of an industrial area this restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is eclectic to the max. 

The food was absolutely great! High quality!! Very tasty!!! Prices were very reasonable! Especially considering the taste, appearance and quality.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Vietnamese food in town! It has the most authentic dishes that I could not find anywhere else in Ontario. The staff there are so professional, friendly and accommodating. Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"A 3.5/4 out of 5 for me - I ordered Special Pho (small, $8.50)
A 3-3.5/5 for my bf - he ordered Chicken Pad Thai ($10)

I sorta rounded up for better than usual service in a sea of mediocre pho places.  Def not a 5* tho.  

Let's face it, pho in this city - & beyond! - is very meh.  It used to be one of my go-to for cheap eats, but it's just soo lacking that it's no longer something I look forward to.

Pho - Very good, good ratio & quality of meats used, broth had some good flavour!  Garnish looked fresh and clean.

Chicken Pad Thai - My bf asked the male owner/manager if the pad thai was spicy, he said, \"No...it's very good!\"  (His stomach reacts to spicy foods.)  Reviews and other pics of this dish also looked quite good.  Arrived to the table and looked quite clumpy.  Noodles that were underneath the toppings were all stuck together.  There were visible chillies mixed in, after it was mixed the dish was quite oily.  After tasting it myself, it was a bit spicy. 

Hot Vietnamese Coffee w/ condensed milk - $4.50, it tasted good with a hint of chocolate.  I should've asked for a top up of hot water 'cause after it was done filtering, cup was like 65-70% full.

Service - Courteous, especially by the male manager/owner.  He was quick to acknowledge that we were waiting for a table and I did see him make a point of going from table to table.  Not sure if he was fishing for compliments or sincere in his questioning.  Aside from that, we were brought the wrong dishes which were supposed to go to our neighbours.  No biggie.  Other servers did not appear as proactive.

Maybe the chef was having an off-day, but pad thai wasn't as good as everyone cracked it up to be.  I haven't tried their rice dishes, but I'd definitely order the pho over the pad thai.  I'd be open to go again to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"First time, I've ever heard of this place.  Had no clue that this place even existed, in a very heavy industrial area, but I gotta say, it's....the 2nd best pho I've had in Mississauga (#1 still remains as Pho Dau Bo @ Creditview/Bristol)

Located on Kamato Road, just off Tomken Road, this place took over the former restaurant which I believe was called Ellen's or something like that.  And truth be told, in the Dixie/Eglinton, with the exception Dixie Park (that Vietnamnese place), there aren't any Pho places in the area (at least to my knowledge there isn't), so seeing this place made me really happy.  I was also sick that day.

When you go inside, it has the tiki-hut, woody furniture decor, which I like, it had a very chill laidback feel to it.  I think on one point of the restaurant, there's karoake so I am wondering if they karoake events and what nots.  When I was seated, I did find the chairs very low, it's not a huge deal but it was a bit of surprise (and I think I see other reviews stating the same as well lol).  

Foodwise, so I ordered the seafood Hu Tieu Mi with egg noodles only.  And the whole dish was absolutely delicious, the only thing I wasn't a fan of was the broth, it was a tad on the salty side but the overall dish was wonderful.  Plus, the dish had liver in it, which I thought it was such an interesting choice of protein to put into it, since I'm used to BBQ pork being the \"pork portion\" of it. Even though I'm not a fan of liver, or its texture, just having it in my dish was a nice touch, since it's unique to have. 

The vermicelli that my friend ordered was on a massive plate/bowl and it was beautifully displayed, also the portion of it was super huge.  Pretty sure that's one of the largest portions of vermicelli I've seen, plus my friend said it was super tasty so I'll take his word for it.

I also order an order of salad rolls and they were so good.  A combination of pork and shrimp with good ratios in the roll.  Not an abundance of noodles, but sufficient amount of basil, with noodles, lettuce and the protein, plus the dipping sauce was so good (even got a 2nd dipping sauce).

Service was great too, they were quick, and brought all the food over together and were attentive for the most part.  Can't complain, great job guys!

So all in all, great lil place for pho, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Viet I've had since Vietnam.  Great service, ambiance and presentation.   Food is authentic and genuine with true Vietnamese flavours!!!  Going for dinner again tonight.  Mango salad is the best I've had even compared to Thailand.  Pad Thai had there own spin on it and also was delicious."}
{"text":"if i could lick the plate - i would! This place is a gem. People are nice, Yen is wonderful, and the food is slammin'! I higher recommend you get off the main ave and find Pho Ngoc Yen, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was mind blowing. Everything else is obviously at a higher quality than any other pho restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. Chicken Pork and shrimp pad thai was as awesome as deep fried rolls.  Service was very satisfactory.   Will be going again tomorrow to celebrate my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. I would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone who enjoys authentic Vietnamese food.

For anyone who enjoys karoke, they also have that option as well Saturday night. Restaurant is also visually appealing and spacious, so there's no rush or pressure to leave unlike a typical Pho restaurant.

Will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place from many friends and finally had a chance to give it a try. 
First impressions: 
+ The decor is way different than all those Vietnamese restaurants I've been to and it makes you feel warm and welcome
+Clean and spacious
+Servers were fast, attentive and always welcome you with a smile :)

For appetizer, we ordered mango salad. It come with shrimp crackers on the side and it was, honestly, amazing!  

I ordered Bun Bo Hue (my favorite) and it tastes not surprisingly amazing but way better than those places I've been to, very close to authentic Bun Bo Hue had in Vietnam. Flavourful, strong lemongrass taste with a good kick of spice is what you need for this weather so highly recommend to give this a try. Also, generous portions of meat :p 

My sister order Bun Goi Gia, which is slightly sour tamarind broth with vermicelli, Vietnamese sausages, pork belly and shrimps. Her bowl looked packed with all the veggies. I tried the broth and it was light and tasty. The fried onions and peanuts added a bit of taste into its flavour. 

My mom ordered Hu Tieu My Tho (dry) and it came with a small bowl of broth on the side. My brother in law ordered Mi Xao Gion (crispy noodle). Didn't try it but they looked good to me!

The food came out pretty quick and the size was pretty decent. 

Definitely come back if I'm somewhere nearby and definitely recommend to everyone. This restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Went here with a few coworkers and they were very accommodating and quite friendly. The food tastes amazing and was served quickly. Portions were large and the presentation was instagram worthy. Highly recommend, especially for a date."}
{"text":"Came here to eat some traditional pho but was told they are not like the \"usual pho\" places. We tried out the recommendations the waitress gave us and the \"breakfast style meal\" (I don't remember the name of the dish) was really yummy! If we are in the area again we will be back :) also, extra bonus for having all the Christmas decorations, music, and festive spirit!!! Probably the most decorated restaurant I've been to, love love love the decor"}
{"text":"Great food!! The location has really nice decor as well. We ordered vermicelli during the peak of lunch and the food was definitely on point. I ordered the chicken vermicelli with spring rolls. They not only marinated the chicken beforehand to make it tasty and flavourful but also made crispy spring rolls that I really like. The food was pretty perfect and so was the price. However, service was very slow. We waited for our food like it was being made in a slow cooker. I wouldn't suggest coming here unless you have at least a 1.5 hour lunch. Otherwise, I enjoyed it!!"}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Everything from the ambience to the service to the food was amazing. The building itself has really nice décor (plants, decorations, artwork). Our waiter was superb, as well. He made some great recommendations and had a lighthearted attitude. And as to the food, it's hard to go wrong. The Cha Gio were great as an appetizer, and all of the pho dishes we had were delicious. Overall, we had a great time here, and I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there with parents, and we enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. The waiters were extremely nice, and recommended courses appealed to our taste, especially their home-made sauces. Very good, will come again if around."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick afternoon snack to try more items on the menu. They added a drink menu on the front page! 

What i ordered:
Fresh Passion fruit juice
Iced Tea latte
MN11 - pork and snail pancake
MN15 - grilled chicken and deep fried coconut rice
T10 - veggie pad thai

The pancake wasnt really a pancake but more like a flat meatball with chunky bites in it which i assume its the snail. It was a little dry for me, but flavours were still good. Loveeeeeeed the grilled chicken and coconut rice! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! The lemon grass sauce was seeeeeeew good too. Veggie pad thai was just meh. Wasnt impressed, jus wanted to try it cuz i didnt get to last time and see whats it about from all the yelp reviews. 


Ps. Door has a note saying accepting Visa and Mastercard for more than $10. Pretty sure last time they made me pay cash/debit and i spent $90+. Maybe its new?"}
{"text":"Visited this hidden gem on a Friday late afternoon!

It's literally a restaurant inside a commercial complex attached to regular offices, not where you'd expect to find a restaurant...

Had my friend not recommended this place, I probably never would've found it to be honest. 

The moment you walk in, you'll be greeted by the hosts, and it'll feel like you're walking into a tropical place. They've renovated this place with a lot of detail to give that kind of ambience.

The service is great here, and the food is also very tasty! They definitely do an amazing job with the presentation of the dishes. 

If there's one thing I must comment on that made our ordering process a little tougher, is that they should include some photos on their menu.  Had it not been for the fellow yelpers posting photos, we would have a hard time picking what we wanted to order.

I would definitely come back again, as it seems like they have a wide variety of choices for the vegetarian menu, a must try with my other half next time!"}
{"text":"Bruh. Authentic and delicious. Few dishes I haven't been able to find anywhere else in the GTA"}
{"text":"I dont give 5 stars very often... they're reserved for the exceptional.  Places that have wonderful service, food, and a particular special experience that just elevates it from great to the best.  Pho Ngoc Yen deserves a 5 star because the owner and the family make this completely a really great meal and experience.  The attention of the details, thoughtful service, really great soup base (get the more complex Bun Bo Hue ones!!), and better quality ingredients all made me want to come back to try more.

As everyone has said, it's in the middle of no where.  They are not kidding.  If I wasn't paying attention, I would have figured it be another commercial space.  Inside though it's a quaint, clean, restaurant that veers towards a tropical Asian spin.  I have to admit, the cute pumpkin display was eye catching because every kid in the area zoomed into it and wanted to play.  There is also a karaoke station as most people mentioned.   There were no takers on a super busy Sunday lunch.  I dont think you necessarily need reservations but there was a constant huge wave of many customers.  It can get busy.

Fresh Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls - This was made fresh ... that is such a huge relief.  Not a dry or overly rubbery chewiness.  It was filled with really big, plump, and 'QQ' shrimp that makes this so much better than the average fresh shrimp roll.  Sauce was a nice addition... I think they could have used the more spicier with a dash of fish sauce to get it more authentic but still very good.  4.5/5

Shredded Mango Salad with Shrimp Chips - This dish was much larger than I expected.  i dont think we ate half!  It's perfectly cut matchstick of mango with tons of dried shrimp to add to the savouriness of it.  Shrimp chips were perfectly crispy and not oil bombs.  Though it is mango and it's sweet, the dressing kept it in the perfect balance of savoury and sweet.  4/5

Quick note...I suspect all broths are good but get the Bun Bo ones... more complex with lemongrass to give it a nice light herbal note and a good kick of spice to get your sinuses going in a good way!  I find Bun Bo Hue soup far more flavourful and harder to get it right... This was very well done!  Also they were generous on the fresh bean sprouts for you to add.  

Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Lemongrass Pork Soup with Meat) - Fill with many quality pieces of meat and vermicelli.  Every piece was meaty, tender, and never stingy.  We didnt have any fake meat meatballs or tripe filler.  They did have pork blood which was an interesting authentic addition. 
 When you start sniffling from the heat (which I would say is moderate heat... no where close to Asian Hot), but still dive into the soup bowl to scoop everything up, you know its a really great bowl of soup.  5/5

Bun Bo Hue (Vegetarian) - They use mock meat that actually looks legit meat at first but my bowl was filled with lots of tofu as well.  I loved the soup base... so flavourful.  I would definitely come back just for this dish.  It's so hard to find a really great vegetarian spicy soup that doesnt taste watery. 5/5

The service here is incredibly warm, friendly, sincere, and caring.  There was never a slight attitude and the gentle demeanor only added to a great calm restaurant experience.  I think the owner's son was serving our table and he was just amazing.  I honestly wish Pho Ngoc Yen much success ... even though that probably means I have to wait for a table.  But with food and service this good, you can't keep it a secret for long."}
{"text":"An odd back alley location to this restaurant, felt a little sketchy. I heard it was a high end Viet restaurant but it was just a regular restaurant with some unique food items. We ordered the shrimp sake salad (no note the alcohol sake but the fruit sake), beef shrimp paste salad and the best dish fish ceviche served with shrimp crackers. Other dishes were regular ones. We were disappointed they didn't have cocktails, I guess I was expecting a fusion style but it wasn't. we will visit again to taste the ceviche but that's about it.."}
{"text":"Sorry Rua Vang/Golden Turtle Mississauga, you've been unseated. This place is literally in the middle of buttf**k nowhere. Broken rice with lemongrass pork here is more than acceptable. Spring rolls equally so. The pho broth here has a more obvious body and is more flavourful than any other I've had in Mississauga (mind you this is purely from one day/visit). They've stated they are MSG free. The ice cold preserved lemonade was also quite good and was a perfect accompaniment and finish to the meal. Left Pho Ngoc Yen completely sated of my pho craving. Tentative 5 star, will be back to try the other dishes at some point, if I can drag my girlfriend to this inconvenient location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. It's not a typical Vietnamese restaurant.. just give it a try and you'll be blown away. For all noodle soup lovers, this will be your new favourite spot. 

Best dishes:
- Bun Bo Hue (both the meat and vegetarian versions are equally delicious) - this is hands down the best bun bo hue you'll ever try 
- Bun Goi Gia - tamarind peanut soup with shrimp and pork. Soooo goood. 
- Fish Ceviche - served with shrimp crackers
- Bitter melon with tofu (if you like bitter melon) - the flavor in this vegetarian dish is out of this world 
- Fried banana - oh man, this is the best dessert ever. It has a perfect texture and is not too sweet. 

Also, the staff are so friendly. Just ask them for their recommendations. You'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Just want to say that I really love this restaurant. It is kind of hard to find one like this. The servers are very nice and fast. They always serve u with a bright and warm smile. Anything u want just ask them, dont be shy!!  
They also have good knowledge of the food in the menu, if u are foreigner and dont know too much about Vietnamese food, they will help u ^^. 
One more thing makes me want to give here 5 stars is all staff here, feel like home and they make me miss Vietnam too much. 
Hope to come back here as soon as p"}
{"text":"This is our favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA area. Family owned business who puts all their soul and spirit into cooking and providing excellent customer service. We went on a Saturday evening and had the mango shrimp salad, wonton soup, spicy pork vermicelli soup, and chicken and shrimp pad Thai. All dishes were exceptional, made fresh to perfection, with flavours that kept us asking for more. For the amount and quality of food we were served, the price is very low! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to try authentic and delicious Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"This is the best pho place I have been to.  Rich deep broth, fatty beef.  Lots of them, and amazing hot Sauce. 3 kinds.  Inside is very authentic yet feels like home.  Clean all over.  Must come."}
{"text":"A non-descript building on a side street in an industrial part of town, hmmm...you think. Sketchy? The building doesn't offer much more hope. It could've housed a UPS Store or a sewing machine repair center. 

Walk through the narrow, distressed door, and you're transported to another dimension. Beautifully decorated with artifacts, nick-nacks, and complete with a stage, LED icicle lights dangling, begging people to dance, like a street pro beckoning you for transactional ecstasy.

It's busy. The staff are focused...buzzing...their missions clear: Clean this table, seat these people, bring tea, disappear into the hive, reappear with amazing food.

Your mission, what to do? You're thrown at a table...maybe they hand you a menu and order pad, maybe you have to ask for them. There's no explanation for the sheet but it's self-explanatory. Find food, write it down. You're playing the part of Flo this afternoon. 

You peruse the menu leisurely, wishing you could read the Vietnamese descriptions as they surely jump off the page, into your nostrils and mouth, then settle comfortably in the warm, cozy confines of your digestive system.

But what to choose?! The menu is your dealer and you need a fix. Pho, spring rolls...nah, those are only a prologue to the harder stuff. Get high on the Mì Xào Giòn Chay. Fried, crisp ramen noodles, splayed about a vessel of fresh lettuce, sinking in a boiling sea of broth. Vegetables piled on top dissuade your eating instruments from achieving their destiny of rescuing ever-drowning noodles before their corpses float limp, lifeless in the steaming cauldron."}
{"text":"5 stars service
3.5-4 stars for the food. They also have a vegetarian menu.

My boyfriend and I ate here on a whim. He ordered a large pho tai bo vien and myself Bo Kho.  We both agreed my dish was better than his, but this is because his pho was very sweet. It's not \"bad\" but we're very used to eating pho places with a saltier base, usually found at typical authentic Vietnamese places. It's a different spin off, but the sweetness can be a little overwhelming to those who are more used to the old school tradition of cooking pho. None the less, the pho was decent. this place has karaoke events on weekends, which is very Vietnamese and it's nice that they hold social gatherings.

Overall, the decor is nice, service was awesome and the food was decent. I hope this place definitely prospers as its definitely hidden away in the industrial area."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from blogto. It's kind of a hidden gem in an industrial area but worth the drive. I haven't had better pho anywhere else and I've been to a lot of pho restaurants. I ordered the pho dac biet here and they offer a generous portion of meat here. Seems like it's family owned and the service is good. I have nothing but good things to say about this place if you're a pho lover."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite Vietnamese restaurant! What makes it the best? everything, starting from the decor to the service and of course the food. 
Location is a bit odd but once you step in you'll be transported to Vietnam with the beautiful tropical-style decoration. 
It was pretty busy but we were immediately shown to a table. The menu was different to the usual Vietnamese restaurants as it wasn't a novel full of options but rather a few pages of specialized dishes and with many options. There was also one page just with vegetarian options.  
We started off with vegetarian spring rolls, which turned out to be the best spring rolls I've had in Canada. I then got my staple, which was the rice w/ grilled chicken and fried egg. My friends got the pad thai, bun bo hue and one vegetarian noodle soup. Reviews from my friends were all good. One mentioned that this was the first vegetarian pho where the broth actually had flavour and the tofu and mushroom pieces were made in a way that made the dish feel meaty. My meal was amazing too. Although not as huge of a portion as what you would get at Pho mi 99 or I Love Pho, but it was the right size where I didn't end up leaving feeling like I ate an whole chicken. 
The servers were extremely friendly and one lade in particular, who seemed like the manager, approached us several times asking how we like the food and also gave us a bowl of homemade hot sauce which she warned was extremely hot...and they were!
The food arrived in a timely manner and the prices were the usual prices for Vietnamese restaurants. I have no complaints! The fact that they are located so randomly and yet are crazy busy shows that they're worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. There was karoke. Pricing wasnt too bad. Exotic menu! The servers sang happy birthday to our birthday girl! Extremely patient and ready to help!"}
{"text":"Hidden in an industrial area in the Tomken area, it's definitely a hidden gem. Upon entering the place, you feel like You travelled to Vietnam (even though I've never been there). It's neat that it's the first Viet place with a mini stage for live performances and area to dance. Perhaps they have evening performances. 

Two waitresses wore traditional dresses while the others didn't. They should be more consistent. For an Asian place, they were friendly and they took our orders. 

The pho noodle soup was good, but the soup base could be hotter in temperature. They gave me lots of basil which was great! My partner had the vermicelli with grilled chicken and he loved it. He said it was juicy. 

Verdict: The prices were decent for this type of establishment. I would go back and try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this hidden gem.  Don't be deceived by the outside appearance.  It is in an industrial area but the interior is phenomenal.  Food was some of the best I've had. Flavourful and excellent portion. A keeper!"}
{"text":"I came here again because my friend wanted to try the restaurant so I went in to order the my tho clear noodle with seafood and pork. The flavor was great and I liked the abundance of seafood (though nothing fancy, just calamari, shrimp and fake crab roll) and pork slices. 

What stood out to me the most yet again is their customer service. The owners were nice to go around asking about our food experience a couple of times and they were quick with their services. They were attentive and they valued our feedback. My friend thought his soup for his pho was very oily. You could see lots and lots of oil bubbles. I told my friend to complain but he didn't thinking that perhaps it was what their soup is like. I said no, I had pho there before and it's not the case. Finally when the owner came around to ask about our experience again, my friend spoke up. The owner looked concerned and he further apologized saying that his soups are usually not like that since they only use quality beef. The owner wanted to make my friend a new one but my friend said it's okay. The owner insisted and he said that he'll make one to go for my friend. Finally my friend agreed and he also thought the customer service was exceptional. On our way out, the owner apologized again before sending us our way out. 

Complimentary meal aside, in the competitive world of restaurant business, it's becoming increasingly important to standout not just in food, but in customer service. If you want returning customers, it's important to make customers feel awesome after a meal! And the owner did just that!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty picky eater when it comes to pho ?especially depends on the beef they use and obviously how the pho tastes. This new pho joint is located in the industrial part of Heartland (Tomken/Matheson). And to be honest, I wouldn't have known about this hidden place if it wasn't for Narcity. 
It's pretty easy to get to but because it's in an industrial area, I would think that it might be harder to find parking spots as there are other businesses around in the same complex. When you enter the restaurant, it's as if you're in somewhere tropical. There's a lot of decoration that hinders a tropical feel (never been back to Vietnam but it's probably trying to replicate it). 
Their menu option isn't as big as other pho places but the main stuff are there and that's all you want to get. We came on a Sunday afternoon around 11am for lunch and we were seated in the corner which fits about 8 people and some room to spare. We were checked up on occasionally asking how we were/how's the food etc. 
We ordered Pho special, pho tai, spring rolls, and Vietnamese drip coffee. 

Decently sized seating space. They're closed on Mondays and I heard on weekends they have karaoke. They legit have a stage on one side. 

Will comment on my order (Tai) and it's actually really good. The soup is a little sweet but tastes \"clear\" not like those places that adds a lot of MSG where you'd end up coughing after you finish your meal. In fact, I ended up drinking more soup after I CLEARED up the pho itself . The beef was how I liked it. There was no fat around the slices whatsoever and they were laid flat on the noodles. Other places have it fatty and scrunched up which I absolutely hate. There were lots of garnishment and overall tasted amazing. 

Spring rolls legit tasted like the ones my mom makes at home. Trying to not boost my mom here, but she's  at making spring rolls. So this was good. It looks like a typical spring roll, not too much batter coated on it to make it more crispy. It was played on a leaf and presentation was nice. 

Su Da (drip coffee) I had this for the first time and you have to be patience with this. Takes maybe 15 minutes to fully drip onto condensed milk which you stir and pour into the empty cup with ice. It's rich and creamy but it's too sweet for me; stilll good. 

Update: went here again to try the veggie Bun Bo Hue and this was really good too. There were a LOT of veggies and soup was semi spicy. I would've added more spice to it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in an industrial area on the West side. We were a bit skeptical as we were approaching the strip plaza, but the reviews were right - this place is fantastic! I was immediately won over by the warm and hospitable staff, who were more than happy to give recommendations should you need any. We ordered 2 bowls of pho and a Vietnamese coffee, and devoured everything in minutes. I don't venture out west much, but the next time I do, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've tried many (if not almost all) pho restaurants in Mississauga and this one is my new favorite. Broth is good, food is always consistent and service is top notch & extremely friendly, which isn't very common in other pho restaurants. 

Would recommend pretty much anything on the menu but some favorites are: the pho, obviously, bo kho, mango salad and their dessert che. Also they make their pepper sauce in house! A lot of friends and family are huge fans of this place."}
{"text":"This place was a treat!  I just gotta start off by saying that the restaurant was gorgeous and the staff was so lovely!  They had great suggestion, and were so polite and quick.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try Vietnamese food for the first and to anyone who has been eating it for years.  Everything I put in my mouth was delicious.  I strongly suggest getting the pad thai and the pho... obviously get the pho... but both of those dishes were above and beyond with flavours that will just dance in your mouth!  I would really like to go back here soon :) ."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, newly opened. Cute decor. Decent food better than other pho places. The pho was tasty, not spectacular but good. Too bad too far for me to come often but will definitely go when in the area."}
{"text":"Literally the pho place of my dreams. Tucked away in the industrial area of Mississauga is this cozy tropical looking spot that's fast becoming one of the top places for Vietnamese food. We got there early and were lucky to get seats since most of the tables were reserved for a Saturday night. The owner and staff were so nice and welcoming, making it seem like we were entering their home. This is definitely a place where you won't leave feeling emotionally abused. 

The menu here is extensive and the portions are large. We went with their signature pho along with some shrimp rolls. The broth was delicious! Clear and sweet, and they didn't skimp out on the meat either. You know you're eating a good bowl of pho when you're slowly entering into a food coma. Would definitely come back again to try their other items just wished it was closer to me!"}
{"text":"This vietamese restaurant is randomly located in an industrial area of Mississauga, and it took a bit of driving in order to find it. But the trek was definitely worth the effort, as the quality of the food here was a step up from typical Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.

We ordered a few staple dishes such as pho, vermicilli, and fresh rolls. The pho here was fantastic, as the broth was very balanced and not overly salty or oily. The fishballs and beef in the pho were delicious and not fatty at all either. Likewise, I thought the chicken pieces in the vermicilli were tender and seasoned well. This place clearly puts an emphasize on using quality ingredients in their food.

The fresh rolls were good but not out of the ordinary. The basket that they came in was cute, however. It was nice to see a Vietnamese restaurant that puts effort into their plating.

All in all, an excellent restaurant for vietamese cuisine for some very reasonable prices! The trek to find the place is a bit out of the way, but the food more than makes up for it =)"}
{"text":"Best pho in the GTA and it's not even close. The broth is rich and has the perfect amount of flavour. The only place I've been to where I finish everything including the broth every time."}
