{"text":"This place is so close to my work and we often go their for the sandwiches. The lady is so friendly there, she always smiles preparing the sandwiched. I haven't tried their salads yet but there are plenty of choices. Usually we pay $5 per each. Its a good price. But its really hard to find the location if you don't know the place especially now with a construction in front."}
{"text":"Love this hidden place (yes it's at the back of a convenience store)... Instead of buying all your veggies and fruits to make a salad (and have most of it go bad because ur only one person)- this place has a whole selection that is already chopped up and ready for you to pick from their buffet style selection!!  You get a choice of a small or large container and you just fill up on the stuff you like... Most of the food is healthy; fruits, veggies, tofu, eggs etc. You can add meat or falafel at the counter for protein and voila- a simple healthy meal with no trouble at all... The value is great for what you get- no more wasting time chopping up veggies for a salad for me anymore :) I have to add that the lady at the cash is AMAZING and so so friendly... Also super fast and efficient at moving the line very quickly during the busy times which is mainly lunch time during the work week.  Nothing fancy at this place but you're not there for the look of the place but for the food! :)"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place to me and I am forever grateful! I mainly build my own salad ($4.99/lb) which usually gets me a good amount. Lately i have been having cravings for potato salad and pasta salads and they make them so yummy here! I did try the western sandwich ones it was alright, satisfying but not amazing and decent for $2.99  There is a great selection and Wendy is super nice. She makes you feel welcome and she genuinely is grateful for your business. I always look forward to going for for lunch!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the convenience store at the front of this place, Fit for Life is a truly hidden gem! It has a fresh, widely varied salad, fruit and kimchi bar and the pricing per 100 gms is quite reasonable. The staff are super friendly too and the place is very clean. Decor...I'm never so concerned about this but I wish the convenience store nonsense were tucked away somewhere less conspicuous and that there were more seating near the window. Will definitely be a lunch regular here!!"}
{"text":"Wendy, the very sweet and kind Chinese owner is exceptionally helpful, customer oriented and very generous. Their salad bar is amazing , giving one almost all the necessary rainbow colors a salad bowl requires. Her sandwiches and the daily prepared dishes are of good quality, however, some of the prepared food such as the noodles and seafood need quite a bit of oil reduction. One can definitely make a very juicy and tasty meal out of so much options. You can also custom make your smoothies, sandwiches , wraps, or anything at your own discretion. T.O. for sure needs more places like this with reasonable pricing. I have tried other fit for life branches , but they aren't even close to the options this place offers :-)"}
{"text":"Tried their burritos few times, it wasn't as nice as other authentic places which was expected.  But it's not bad if you just need something quick to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"Hidden gem tucked away at the back of a convenience store so it's easy to miss. Great variety of food at the salad bar and great value for money. Friendly, courteous service."}
{"text":"If you're just looking to fill up in the morning this is the place to go. How can you go wrong with $2 breakfast sandwiches? The line moves fast which is cool if you're in a rush to get to work.  Salads & Breakfast sandwiches: 210 - 410 calories Pitas, Wraps & Burritos: 390 - 850 calories"}
{"text":"Love grabbing my $2 veggie western in the morning for breakfast. The staff are genuinely nice people. I only go there 3-4 times a month but the girl there always recognizes me and remembers how i like my sandwich. I don't have salad too often as i don't care too much for cold foods. I picked up some cold fried tofu and didn't like very much. It was dehydrated and rubbery.  But that said, they do have a great selection of salad items. Also love their $5 lunch deals. Im vegetarian so i only get their veggie burrito on fridays. Great meal for the price."}
{"text":"This is the best Fit For Life location you will find in and around the GTA. This spot is a must for lunch if you work near Yonge and Eglinton. The salad bar is fantastic and the staff are amazing. For around $7 dollars you can take a healthy salad and assorment of protein and fresh fruit back to your desk that will have your co-workers asking where you were for lunch or you can go for one of their sandwiches/wraps or spicy noodle dishes."}
{"text":"A healthy and affordable lunch spot in Commerce Court!  I had a very tasty falafel wrap for lunch. It was served on a whole wheat wrap with tomatoes, taboule, hot sauce and another hummus-like sauce. Really very good. And only $4.99 - probably the cheapest food court lunch I've had in a long time. For $7.99 you can also have a salad and a pop. Genius."}
{"text":"I love going here on my lunch break. Very efficient service and the cashier is super nice!"}
{"text":"One of the worst lunch experiences of my life. The \"box\" lunches are absolutely horrendous. Ingredients are NOT fresh, particularly the steak and the falafel. And they are filled 80% with white basmati rice. I wouldn't eat there again, even if it was offered for free. Complete waste of money. Also, ew."}
{"text":"While the sandwiches were decent, they were too expensive for what we received. The real problem with this location is the staff. You'll see a repeated theme across reviews for this King Street location.  Upon entering, no greeting except a woman coming out from the back on a clearly personal cell phone call. She looked at me as if saying, \"what do you want?\" I asked her if she was ready for me to order, and she seemed perturbed to have to end her call to help me.   I was ordering (4) sandwiches, so there no was way she could continue her conversation and productively help me. But you can see where her priorities were -- clearly not with the customer.   At the end, of course no thank you despite my curtesies.  I'd avoid this place accordingly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and had 2 zesty chicken burritos. 5 dollars a piece. Huge?  Definitely not!  If I didnt get two, i'd still be hungry.  Each burrito is about 600grams.  So if you eat 2 of them it's like 2.6lbs or so. One burrito might fill a regular person I guess. I don't know...maybe i'm just hippo. Taste wise is good! I wouldnt pay regular price for it though.  I'd probably feel ripped off, if i did.  Get the specials. Is it really healthy for you though? who knows. The website is under construction still. Tasted good though.. that's all I care."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here today! The  moment I walked in, I was warmly greeted even there were a couple of people ahead of me. Shabhab helped me choose a sandwich and when I couldn't decide which protein to close, he told me about the recipe he uses to marinate the steak (it's cooked fresh by him!) and I was sold. He was patient yet efficient as I chose the toppings (so many I got to add to my steak wrap!) and he also helped me choose the best sauce to add and his choices (house dressing and hot sauce). He cut my sandwich in half because I said I wanted to eat half there and take the rest with me (so nice!). Hasib was wonderful in setting me up worth my iced coffee (which eas only $1!). Both men were very kind and helpful. Overall awesome experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"So bad!  This place is located in the concourse of the Atrium, where a lot of office works go for lunch.   Reasons not to go: - Unbelievably slow service, you'll spend your lunch hour in line - So much confusion behind the counter, too many people asking what you want, not enough people actually making it - No choice of toppings or sauce, - Strange smell that lingered for ages in my office.   And particularly strange: - Cheap bowls?! (My soup container had soaked through by the time went to eat it ten minutes later)  Don't go."}
{"text":"Swung in for lunch to check it out. I appreciate the approach to simplified pricing - $8 for any salad burrito, grain bowl or panini sandwich with your choice of protein. I had the chicken shwarma panini sandwich which was pretty decent. For $8 it's not exactly a deal but it's not terrible for downtown pricing. Would I go back? Probably not. There's yummier chain options for salads and sandwiches in the area (Fast Fresh, Pumpernickel).  The bad?  I wanted a salad but all of the options were sad and wilted so I chose the sandwich option.   Also, there's an upcharge for hummus or guacamole of $2!!!! That's the highest I've seen yet especially on an $8 sandwich. At the register when I saw the charge, I said \"WHOA that's steep! I was not even told there was a cost.\" The cashier was nice enough not to charge me, which is why they're getting the extra star for customer service."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I work in the area so I've tried most of the possible food spots for lunch options. This one beats them all in my opinion.  If you like healthy food and variety you should give this a go. Be warned: this is not a spot for the grease loving North American crowd - no deep fried or stale veggies here :). It is much healthier than \"Fresh\" and much much cheaper. And the service is alot friendlier and faster as well. Once it took me 20 minutes to get my order of kombucha and pre-made salad at Fresh...but thats a whole different topic.   Back to fit for life - try their salad bar - their best feature!"}
{"text":"the bowl is not worth it... the chicken shawarma topping was pretty gross.  The smoothie was alright, maybe I'll go back for that."}
{"text":"Just came here to have their Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It was made to order, good customer service, good location and most of all delicious wrap! Will come back for sure. I usually come here after school and/or after my workout."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Fit for Life at Bay and Dundas (Atrium on Bay). I decided to try this King and Victoria location on my way to work this morning and was not impressed.  Service: - The person making the sandwich was not very efficient and hard to understand. Both the person in front of me and I had to ask her to repeat things several times. - The cashier didn't seem very happy. He rang in my order without telling me the total and told me to just tap my Visa card. The terminal was also turned towards him so the customer could not see the total. - I got no smiles, greetings, thank you, or have a great day. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I remember when I was in customer service roles, I would say all of the above for every transaction.  Being Cheap: - I had a free coffee with my meal and tried to substitute for a tea. He tried charging me $1.25 for it. At the Atrium on Bay location you can substitute the coffee for a tea at no charge. I settled for the coffee.  The Product: - The veggie deluxe is my favourite. I used to get it almost every day at the Atrium on Bay. It tasted really bland and not very fresh at the King location. - The coffee itself was self-serve at this location and was lukewarm coming out of the dispenser.  I definitely won't be back to this King and Victoria location. If I still worked by the Atrium on Bay location I would definitely go back. This location puts the franchise to shame."}
{"text":"I pass by here for lunch from time to time and overall I'm very pleased.   Pros   - Great prices (especially the daily $5 deals)  - Great service   Cons  - None"}
{"text":"It's a wonderful place for grabbing a quick lunch to eat at work, they have a great selection of salad ingredients, and their soups are delish too. The checkout lady is always nice and friendly. I wish it was on my side of the street though :)"}
{"text":"PROS:  Clean Heathly fast food Good amount of protein plus Vegs Can choose wrap or bowl   Cons  $$$$9 for a wrap with some carbs and some  veggie!!"}
{"text":"Ooooo Fit For Life... how do you get your chicken so rubbery........  + Salad in a bag  This place is a good weight loss strategy.  I ate about 6 bites of my lunch and tossed the rest out. Sick."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court south of University and King in the PATH.  There's a big sign advertising $5 sandwiches or wraps. Different deal everyday. They also offer a $2.80 breakfast sandwich deal.  Their menu consists of pitas, wraps, and panini's. There's a salad bar, but there isn't anything about salad so presumably those will be going into one of the above items.  You have the option of choosing from a selection of half a dozen different vegetables and a couple sauces. When the wrap or sandwich is assembled, they'll put it on the grill, served hot and fresh.  Don't expect much in terms of service: they will ask the minimum that is required to fulfill your order. If you don't want it to be grilled you will need to specify it as well since they assume it will be grilled (unlike SUBWAY where toasted is an option).  I've had the tuna wrap and the chipotle chicken panini and they've both been satisfying. It's canned tuna, but they give you a lot and it doesn't have too much mayo. The panini comes with what tastes and looks like actual chicken meat.  If you're looking for something quick and easy to eat and under $7, you can give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had a very unpleasant experience with my breakfast this morning. I go here very often for my breakfast and usually get veggie western for $2. This morning I was more hungry and asked for an extra egg. My disappointment was when I got charged extra $2 for an egg??!!!! Really??!!! I could as well get two sandwiches if I knew I would get charged extra $2 for an egg. It seems like they make prices as they go, because I did hear before that extra egg costs 75 cents. So I guess it's a face control price forming?! I'm very disappointed as I'm their loyal customer, so now I'm wondering if I should ever go back. And it's not about the money, I just do not want to be taken advantage from..."}
{"text":"Newly reopened with better signage and the same everything else.  This place has decent falafels, but it's not top drawer.  First off, what's with the perpetually under-ripened tomatoes?  Does the manager grow these things with a couple of compact flourecent bulbs in his basement?  Several times, I have walked away after siting these anemic looking things.  Seriously, these are the whitest tomatoes ever.    Today, I had a BLT and the tomato was ridiculously white.  Worse, the sandwich came thick with \"butter\", and I mean thick like cream-cheese thick.  Worserer, the bacon had a vaguely fishy smell to it.  Yuck.  Look for me in the Hiedi's line up a few feet away."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the area...anything and everything you could want for the best prices, wraps, rice, chicken, Salad Bar so you can make your own salad, ANY veggie or fruit you could want or crave. Daily specials and my personal favorite is on Thursdays the chilli chicken with rice. I highly recommend this place and Wendy the owner is so nice and friendly. Trust me if your looking for a fast delicious and healthy meal then look no further !  5 out of 5"}
{"text":"I dropped off one star only because I'd have gone to this place much sooner had I known it was there! It's hidden in the back of a convenience store in the Bell building (by all the Crosstown construction)  Super friendly staff, fresh produce in the salad bar. My wish list would be for allergy alerts (icons?) for the premixed salad bar items, and for an indicator of organic produce."}
{"text":"Ok so I work up at Yonge and Eglinton. There are a fair few places to choose from when looking for something to eat at lunch. One of my colleagues recommended Fit for Life and oh lordy I am so glad they did!   Everything is so fresh and delicious, the first time I went I did not quite understand you pay for your salad box by the weight...oh dear!   The cucumber dressed in yogurt, mint and dill - wow! Sweet potato salad is also lovely.   Fit for life...when you realize salad can be amazing!"}
{"text":"Fit for Life is my regular lunch spot.  After revamping my diet, Fit for Life has been supporting my diminishing gut one delicious salad at a time.   This place is great, they have great healthy fresh food for reasonable prices. I'm a fan of their salad bar. This type of layout is common in the states and even found in convenience stores in NYC. It's a simple salad bar that offers a plethora of choices. Different lettuce mixes, cucumbers, beets, corn, pasta salads, olives, tomatoes, strawberries, pineapple, mango, avocados, and the list goes on.   The salads are priced by weight and often times, the owner will cut you a deal.  The wraps are full of vegetables and taste fresh as well. If the healthiness is overbearing, you can opt out for a $5 lunch box. These consist of your choice of rice or noodles and your choice of stir-fried protein item (spicy chicken, black bean beef, etc.). I always go for the half and half (both chicken and beef). They really fill up the containers here!  To top it off, the owners are especially sweet and kind.   Whether you're in the mood for a healthy meal or a slightly greasy stir-fry substitute for Manchu Wok, this is your place. Good food for a great price."}
{"text":"A brand new Fit for Life opened in the Hudson's Bay Centre near Yonge and Bloor. I was super excited as I thought they would have plenty of healthy options including lots of vegan options.  Sadly, they only have one or two vegetarian options for breakfast and lunch/dinner.  I came on the first day (and I'll excuse hiccups because they were obviously trying to work through the kinks) and got a vegetable burrito which was okay.  Nowadays, when I order a burrito, they either put in brown rice or give you a choice of brown or white rice.  This place only had white rice. So I stuck with it, but I seriously don't understand how a place called Fit for Life can only have white rice and no other grain options.   At 8.99, the burrito was not cheap, it was somewhat filling, but not necessarily satisfying. I felt it was missing something. They had guacamole, but I didn't really taste it.  Verdict: It's normal fast food 'healthy' but nothing spectacular.  I'd rather go to Salad Days."}
{"text":"Amazing salad bar! So many different options such as seaweed salad. Also, very well priced. Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a total gem. It's located at the back of a convenience store. The lady who works there is super friendly. Their breakfast sandwich is $2.10 and they always load up the veggies for me when I get the vegetarian option. The salad bar has plenty of fresh and unique options and you can customize it to your liking. It's measured by weight and a small full box usually cost me around $6. I got their mango smoothie once, and they added extra blackberries, veggies, and other fruits for me all for the same charge. If you want a healthy option for breakfast and lunch for a really great price, come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ordered cheese on whole wheat and it was soaked in butter... Not really a \"fit for life\" meal...."}
{"text":"Just went here for a veggie burrito-it was good.  This place is fast food with no place to sit down(unless you go to the food court.)  It's a good place if you want fast food."}
{"text":"My new breakfast place.  Pros: -Cheaper than Timmy's breakfast - $3.99 for a breakfast sandwich + coffee -Smaller lineup compared to Timmy's -Healthier than Timmy's - real veggies, bacon, egg, etc.  Healthy substitutions: brown bread, brown sugar  Con: -No Roll Up the Rim"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for business people in the area.  I used to visit this place two or three times a week back when our office was next door.  It is sort of hidden inside of a convenience store, but once you find it, you'll make the regular trip there for breakfast and lunch.  Picture a small cafeteria with ultra friendly staff who knows the regulars by name.  The food here is fresh and cheap.  You can get omelettes for breakfast served on bread, a wrap, or on it's own -- for $3.  Lunch consists of different daily specials, typically a stir fry or meat of some sort served on rice or noodles.  A small portion is $4 (enough for most people) or $7 for a large (my size).  They also have gourmet sandwiches, fruit smoothies, wraps.  Everything is made to order.  For Yonge and Eglinton, the service and prices are excellent!  The biggest draw to this place is its DIY salad bar.  There's easily over 50 items (maybe even 100) and you mix everything you want -- fruits, veggies, nuts, dressing, etc. and pay by weight -- $5/lb.  You can get a nice meal sized salad in the $5-10 range.  I love to mix in fruit with my salads, so the DIY style was perfect for me.  They also have frequent user cards, where you can earn a free meal after 9 visits.  I've had countless free meals over the 4+ years I spent there.  I miss this place!"}
{"text":"The $5 sandwich of the day is now $6, so I'm less stoked on this place than I was when I first started coming here. It's still a fair offer, but the value isn't what it once was given a 20% price jump.  Grilled chicken pita on Mondays is probably my favourite of the daily specials. Philly Cheesesteak Pita on Thursday was good, but skimpy on the steak part.  The salad bar looks like a good option for veggie friendly people, but that's not my jam so I'll leave that to others to review."}
{"text":"As others have said they have good service. Somehow they knew i was a fresh face and told me about the lunch menu specials.   Ordered the western breakfast sandwich on whole wheat. Rubber eggs...hard on the outsise of the circle disc of premade eggs. Disappointing"}
{"text":"To go place to grab lunch. A small box of customized salad is often around $5. There's a lot of variety with salads: kale, quinoa(my favourite), mango, pasta ... The list goes on. The fruits are fine, they don't taste too fresh but it is understandable since they probably have been standing outside for 1-2 hours. The veggie burrito on Friday is also the bomb, very similar to chipotle for only $5!! I have introduced several of my friends to this place and they have become a regular as well."}
{"text":"The nutritional information is finally out on their website and--surprise, surprise-- it's not all that healthy, with nearly all of their wraps, paninis and salads coming in at around 20g fat and 500 calories. But hey, anyone who thinks a chicken ceasar wrap is a light option is kidding themselves.  I like the cheap breakfast here: A veggie eggwhite ommelette with toast comes in at around $4.  The service is so gruff it makes me laugh, which is as close to a compliment to service I think you'll find here, and I do mean it as one. They manage a long line at a tiny counter pretty well, and when they scream BUTTER AND KETCHUP? directly into my face, it not only makes me giggle, but wakes me up for work too!  For a cheap healthy lunch, your best bet is the lentil soup. Dairy-free, so I'm guessing it's very low in fat, and all those lentils are high in both fiber and protein. Tasty and filling, but comes with a stale bun that's only good for dipping . Coming in at under $3 for a small, it's the best deal in the Path."}
{"text":"This place is THE best. Wendy doesn't advertise because word of mouth of her amazing business gives her a lot of business as it is.  I started coming here after my workouts at the nearby GoodLife and I became quickly hooked.  Like an addict, I come here and scour the salad bar and it is exactly what the name says -- FRESH.  Wendy and her team start from scratch every morning and it is as fresh as possible and she is so friendly.  I haven't ordered a sandwich because the variety in the salad bar is so extensive -- and it's not your typical salad bar.  There's cooked sushi rolls, eggrolls, kimchi, egg salad, pasta salads, bean salad, roasted sweet potatoes and other roasted veggies like brussel sprouts -- and the kale/beet salad and mango salad, and the list goes on and on...GO people.  This place is open Mon - Fri. from morning thru lunch.  It is awesome."}
{"text":"$2.10 total, for an egg sandwich. You can get BELT, ham and egg or vegetarian. The have more breakfast version at different price point, but it's the sandwich that I always get.   It's interesting because for the longest time, they kept charging us $2.50, even though the sign said $2. It was over a year, until they finally just said $2.10. Either way, we still go here almost every morning.   I guess the same people always go here, because they pretty much know everyone's order already. Everything is made fresh in front of you and it takes them just about 5 minutes to make it for you.  I give them a 5 because it's where my coworkers and I also go. I mean, where can you find a $2 breakfast sandwich these days that are actually not processed? It's healthy and yummy.   The also have $5 pitas, depending on the day.   Monday - grilled chicken pita.  It's like eating chicken salad in a pita. It's so fresh and tastey.  They added hummus, which made the pita so much more filling.  Tuesday -  tuna sandwich (my fave)  Almost every Tuesday, my coworker has this for lunch.  It's pretty good.  Wednesday - chipotle chicken panini (it's also pretty good)   Thursday - Philly cheese steak (it's a meh)  I wouldn't order it again.  I actually don't recommend it.  It's a disappointment to what a Philly cheese steak should be.  I mean, it's not bad, just not good for what it is supposed to be.  Friday - vegetarian burrito (I've  never tried)  My all time fave from them is the Chicken Bacon Ranch Wrap ($6.99).  The croutons inside give it a crunch to your bite and they're also generous with their bacon.  Mmmmm...I'm actually craving one now that I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. My colleague wanted to go there for lunch just to give it a try. The person putting together our food seemed very unsure about what they were doing. And asking for extra ingredients (I asked for extra hot peppers) was met with confusion, and the manager stepped up and said finally to add the peppers. The food was terribly bland and they were very stingy with the sauces, as in they put the thinnest layer possible in the sandwich. I threw half of my food away, and my colleague was not happy with his.. throwing out the last couple bites. I also had a rice crispy treat which was very stale and had a chemical taste.  Awful food, not worth what we spent. Never going back. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Walked by this morning and saw the sign for the $2 breakfast sandwich deal and thought I'd check it out. I chose the Western on brown but there were other choices like BELT too.. The food itself was just a simple (small) omelette on toast but for $2 you can't really go wrong.  Also to note, they have daily $5 specials on various sandwiches and wraps.. starting at 11am.  I'll be back for sure - It's a block from my client's! ;)  ==  UPDATE: I originally rated this on the price, but since I've gone back a few times and realized that the food quality is really not that great I'm dropping the rating.."}
{"text":"This location has been newly renovated and has new ownership! I was surprised the first time I came back and tried out their food! I must say I have been addicted since! I have been going back almost every single day to the point where they know my order now lol. The chicken is so fresh and very very clean/healthy tasting. That's so hard to find now especially with big chains like this one. I highly recommend their wraps and Panini's - delicious."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Man making the breakfast sandwiches was very very VERY sparing with the sandwich contents.  I ordered a BELT.  He tore a single strip of bacon up to add about 1/4 of that strip to my sandwich.  The woman ahead of me ordered a grilled cheese and bacon and he put two half slices of bacon and 2 2×1\" thin slices of cheese.  When she remarked on the scarcity of ingredients, he retorted, \"Well, it's $2.\"  I can get a great $2 sandwich at the Yonge and Eglinton FFL.  Why is the Bathurst station location so disgustingly cheap with its ingredients?"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is so very tasty with a great variety of options. Many kinds of yummy and creative salads. I wish they were open for dinner too!"}
{"text":"The wraps are delicious and they put a lot of vegetables inside.  They have a selection of dressings, ie hummus, tahini,  hot sauce,  ranch,  chipotle,  balsamic vinegar.  Some toppings ie blue cheese cost extra but you get very generous portions. Sometimes they sell Quest bars but not too much at a . Broccoli is only for if you order a separate salad or costs extra . The Bathurst station is closed in with chairs but they don't often have blue cheese.  The College Park location is the food court but gives blue cheese.  They serve lentil soup."}
{"text":"This is as healthy as it could get!It's not the regular fit for life which only has wraps. You need to check it out to see what I meant. The salad bar is made fresh daily replenish often with love. The owner is a sweet lady who loves  what she do. That's is to feed people and make them feel health and great.  The best part is you get to customized your own salad they have pretty much all the good stuff I meant greens, fruits protein, pickles you name it. My absolute favorite is roasted sweet potato they are perfect roasted beautiful caramelized brought out natural sweetness and lots of dietary fiber loads of goodness. Egg salad and potato salad are also very good not super heavy drenched in mayo but good amount so that its creamy.   The Chinese seaweed full of iron so does beets. I always throw in a couple of avocado, that's where the good fat is coming from let alone taste so amazing.  They also have daily special for only $5 I tried the tuna wrap and steak great value. Price are student friendly for the salad by weight. You know a lot of time in downtown core those food court you get a tiny box of greens for over$10 have to admit the price is what throw me off eating healthy cause would still be hungry after eating tiny portion of greens.  As opposed to this place for half the price you get big portion ,fresher and a good variety of ingredients. Once you found it you are are your way to be fit and healthy) I don't want to say lose weight or anything cause I think ultimate most of us want to be fit and feel good about ourselves )"}
{"text":"Fit for Life is my go to place when wanting to grab a quick breakfast to take up to the office. They offer a variety of breakfast sandwiches, made to order, that is always fresh and delicious. It's also very reasonably priced, with a basic fried egg sandwich around $1.50 and a bacon and egg sandwich around $2.25. They don't skimp on the toppings and the sandwich is a hot, delicious and filling breakfast!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know how EXCITED I got when I found this place yesterday? lol   I used to eat at the one in Fairview Mall but I'm not in that neighborhood much anymore and the last time I was there I don't even think it was there.   Anyways I think their prices are reasonable and the variety is unbelievable. I like the 'hot' food options they have.  I had a small container of rice with chicken on top which was mixed with potatos and some other veggies and it came to around $4 and I didn't even finish it.   BUT what you want to come here for is the salad bar. Talk about options.  You grab either the small container or big (which is what almost everyone goes for), and pack away. You can get your traditional garden and cesar salad, and then you have all other other good stuff from just plain veggies like carrots, cherry tomatoes, pepper sticks, pickles, broccoli...and then you have the tuna pasta salads and regular pasta salad. For a little sweetness you can add fruits with yogurt and almonds. Who know you could get excited about salad! :P   Anyways give it a try, the staff is so friendly and just know you're eating healthy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to get a good salad, just keep walking past this place. I was in a hurry and wanted a chicken caesar salad so i stopped at this Fit for Life.  Asked for the salad and no croutons.  They made my salad i paid and was handed what looked like a child size salad for 9 bucks. The container is about the size of my hand.  HUGE RIP OFF.  Go to the grocery store and buy the salad bowl instead. The dressing was terrible and the serving of chicken tiny for the 3.00 add on.  They also use sub shredded lettuce. FAIL"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches, a meagre salad bar and also their main items, Panini or wraps, are what comprises the menu at Fit For Life. I like their paninis because they are grilled. The chipotle sauce on the steak or chicken is more sweet than hot, but tasty. If you do not order the special of the day you could get a stamp toward s a free future sandwich. The problem is it is impossible to know what the special of the day is because it is not stated or advertised anywhere.  The ladies are not very service-oriented probably feeling that the inexpensive fast food paninis and salads do not deserve too much courtesy, but overall it is not as if they are mean. They continue talking to each other in Fujian Chinese and give abrupt answers in case one enquires about anything. They do ask you, as this is an option for customers, about toppings which include mushrooms, onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, etc.  The sandwiches are tasty and feel light, but I much prefer the kind and very polite and sincere service of the Korean husband and wife at Treats at 121 King West up the PATH corridor. It is just such a contrast..."}
{"text":"I got a salad and the vegetables tasted like when you forget to dry your laundry..."}
{"text":"I only heard about this place from a yoga instructor at Yoga Tree Midtown. Just steps away. Boy am I glad I came in here. The salad bar was similar to Whole foods except it won't cost an arm and leg. Approx. $5 for a small box. It was all by weight.   Tried to sample lots of vegetarian options (kale, quinoa, etc.). It was good and fresh.   Staff was very friendly and it was clean. Fit for Life is located at the back of a convenience store.   Will definitely be back again if I'm hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Came here for a breakfast sandwich, service was okay but they were understocked on many items (cheese, juice, etc.), the egg was cold, the toast was soft and thin, the sandwich itself was poorly constructed. Overall, a really depressing commuter breakfast."}
{"text":"Quick, inexpensive and relatively healthy. Always a go-to when I'm in the area and need something quick and easy. Everything is fresh, the place is clean, and you can get a wrap and water for under $10."}
{"text":"VIBE  In this convenience store in-front-healthy eatery at the back, it's like I'm at a buffet except this time it's not at a baby shower and I'm crowded by strangers. Love that this is right near my office and love that there's now a location at Queen and Bathurst.   I ATE Their Thai chicken curry soup is addictive! I always try to get a salad to go with it. Best part? I can pick my own toppings! Ohh yeah. Plus, sometimes, I can have bowtie pasta on my spinach. Because sometimes, there are days like that. Note: please get regular Snapple iced tea. Snapple, are you listening? Don't discontinue your classic iced tea!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Possibly the best value for healthy food in this city. Eating well doesn't have to be for the elite!"}
{"text":"There are two Fit For Life locations in this area, one in the Atrium, and this one, which is actually in Dundas Station on the southbound side. It's kind of tucked away, so it'd be easy to walk right by and not notice it at all, but its worth stopping for a bite to eat if you want something \"healthy\". Beware: this is not the place to go if you're in a rush, unless you pick up one of the ready to go meals that are in the fridge. They tend to take their time making things (all wraps and sandwiches go in the panini press, which adds to the wait time) but they make it fresh in front of you. It's a trade off I suppose!  While not everything on their menu classifies as \"healthy\" (an 800 calorie wrap for one meal doesn't really work for me) I've gone to both locations numerous times, for breakfast and lunch and have had generally pleasant experiences every time.   If you want a quick cheap breakfast they  have a number of \"toonie\" options in the morning, including a grilled cheese. But beware - I got one of these so called $2 breakfasts and by the time I was done, it cost me $5 - but that's because I added bacon and tomato and they never told me how much extra it was (given, I could barely understand the girl but that's my own fault for not clarifying). If you want to pay a toonie, stick with the basics. I'll add that I don't eat a lot for breakfast usually and not eating breakfast at home is rare, so the small grilled cheese sandwich (plain the second time) was enough to get me through the morning til lunch but my male coworker, who values quantity, complained about how small it was. The full blown grilled cheese with bacon and tomato WAS a great option for the \"feeling iffy morning-after-a-night-of-drinking \".  The veggie wrap is rather nice - for something without meat in it, its a filling but light-feeling meal. Also, not too much sauce or stuffing, just the right amount. The Turkey Bacon club is yummy but its also rather large. I have a hard time finishing the entire sandwich and usually someone at work finishes the other half for me.  For a place that claims to be healthy, they've only recently added nutritional information to their website and I was a bit put off by some of the values they had for my favourite meals. However, that being said,  you can eat at Fit For Life without having that guilty \"I just ate McDonalds\" feeling and feel full and satisfied at the same time."}
{"text":"Handy location (Hudson's Bay Centre near Yonge and Bloor station) as I work nearby. I have never tried any \"Fit for Life\" food/products and from the name I thought there would have been many more \"healthier\" options.  I ordered via the Ritual app/website - which is easy to use! I ordered Oatmeal, Cherry Danish and a toasted Western Sandwich (egg, green onion, ham & cheddar cheese on whole wheat toast). I paid $8.78 which is slightly expensive for three breakfast items...not sure if i would try it again tbh.  Tip: check you order before leaving the counter as one of the servers forgot my oatmeal but it was quickly rectified."}
{"text":"In the PATH, there's a ridiculous amount of selection for food.  First thing in the morning, I arrive blearly eyed and most times, I just grab a coffee since I ate breakfast already but for those days where I was running late, I USED to run here.  First thing in the morning, they're one of the few places that are opened very early.  It's quite convenient for those who have to march their way to work before the sun rises.  For less than $3.50, you can get a small but freshly made omelette with various veggies in a toasted pita.  It's not bad and with the freshly toasted pita and hot sauce it really perks you up.  For lunch time, this place has the usual fare of salads, wraps, hummus, and falafel.  I will admit their falafel is one of the better places in the PATH.  You can get a 3 falafels in a wrap for about $5.  It's pretty filling as they do put in a decent amount of vegetables.  Hot sauce is necessary to give it a good bite.  So why the 2 stars... it's the horrible underhanded service.  I came here several times a week as I loved their falafel and one lunch, I decided I wanted a falafel salad instead of a pita because it was way too hot.  They don't offer anything like that on their menu so I asked them if they could do my pita wrap without the wrap.  So I got 3 falafels, fattoush salad, and some carrot sticks.  When it rang up at the cashier, it was $12!! I was shocked.  I asked them why it was over double the price of my usual pita falafel and they said well, they individually charged me for the falafel, the salad, and carrot sticks.  They adamently told me I had to be the $12 ... I should have walked off looking back.  So, that's why I refuse to come back here... it's too bad as their falafel is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Excellent stuff!  We logged into just-eat today and it was the first hit as it's new.  I gave it a peek and was happy to see the words BURRITOS.  =)  We got a tex-mex steak burrito, a veggie burrito, some sweet potato bites (with an amazing sauce), and we actually got 2 extra burritoes because we weren't how sure how big they'd be.  They are HUGE.  I can't really describe the size without it falling into weird places, but they are about six inches long, 2 inches around, and FULLY packed.  I can't believe how little they charge, because these are good.  The steak is really lean and tasty (I tried a bite), and the veggie ones are basically solid packed with totally fresh food - and I would guess that not even 1/3 of the filling is rice.  WOW!  Lots of corn.  We are definitely saving these for tomorrow's dinner, because we can't even THINK of eating anything let alone another whole burrito.  The only thing I would ask/beg for is vats of guacamole.  Pleaaaase?"}
{"text":"I went there this morning and bought a carrot muffin, the muffin tasted awful and not fresh at all."}
{"text":"They seriously need to get their act together. Uninspired food and menus. Food tastes like it has been slapped together by a novice who hasn't cooked before. Salads are just lettuce, carrots, tomatoes and cucumber mostly. I got the asian sesame one day, and just told the lady to not add the fried stuff to it (not-so-fit-for-life stuff). She asked me if I wanted onions and tomatoes and I said \"yes please\". All I got was lettuce with some carrots and a lot of dressing. Given that there are such few express food counters around here, I've eaten here a few times, and always been super disappointed with my food.  The Yonge-Eglinton full service location is far better (except the greasy not-so-fit-for-life daily specials which is mostly noodles), but this one is the pits."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I could. Foolish me wanted a Caesar salad and I quickly ordered one from here. Shredded iceberg lettuce, 1 slab of \"bacon\", a sprinkle of powered parm and some crispy croutons (only redeeming thing) - that was my salad. Rookie mistake to order from here, will not be coming back again. Worst 6$ spent."}
{"text":"I don't know whose life this is fit for, but it isn't mine! I'm an area with a multitude of great lunch options, this place tends to fall short.   Bloor/Yonge lunch places pride themselves on giving you a whole bunch of food for not a lot of money, so it's almost a foreign concept to feel cheated of portions. However, they are very, VERY cheap when it comes to things like toppings. I ordered a turkey club panini, that came with lettuce, tomatoes, and I could count the individual cooked onions they sprinkled on top. I also asked for jalapeños, and got 3 small slices. I mean, I get it, they can't give me a mountain of food, but having enough toppings to cover most of the surface area of my sammich seems standard, no? Anyhow, I paid for my sandwich, but noticed a fatal flaw: no bacon! So I had to take it back. They were very nice about it and offered to make me a new sandwich. However, new sandwich didn't have those jalapeños I had originally wanted. This sounds like a \"so what suck it up millennial princess\" moment, but here's the rub: the sandwich had no flavour without them. The turkey, bacon, bread, and veggies all just tasted like cardboard. (I have ordered this sandwich before and remember thinking \"this is decent!\", so maybe it was just an off sandwich).  My friend orders boxes here and swears by them. Maybe they are a better bet, but with so many options in the area I don't know if I can survive more lunchappointment. That's disappointment in lunch. I made it up, so what?"}
{"text":"I've grabbed a couple of salads at this location. Things are pretty standard. They're nothing you couldn't easily make yourself at home but they'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"FFL is awesome.   Staff is super beyond friendly.  Sandwich options are insane Salad bar is fully stocked. Reasonably priced.  Qualify ingredients throughout.  This is gonna be my go-to stop after working out. Lots of protein to pick from (yay muscle-building) and decent beverage options.   They're good about filling up my water bottle and just cheering me up. Truly committed to fitness and everything that comes with it (including post-workout cranks like me ;)  Looking forward to my next stop here. Will throw on some pics next time.   I RECOMMEND- Everything   EXTRA TIP- make it your sandwich! the ladies here often throw avocado into my sandwich without any extra charge even though it's only part of the salad bar."}
{"text":"Terrible. I got the chicken shawarma because I was in a hurry and there wasn't a line. Huge mistake. This wrap in my hand bears NO resemblance to shawarma. There are chunks of faux-grilled chicken like what you'd get at Tim Horton's! This is not shawarma. AT ALL. I honestly can't identify what type of sauce is in this thing, but it's literally iceberg lettuce, soft peppers that may be cooked or may be old, feta cheese (???) and the not-shawarma chicken. This is a mean joke. Throughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Working at Yonge and Eglinton, I am deeply appreciative this place.  The food is fresh, diverse and healthy.  Relative to what you are getting, it is also very fairly priced.  It utterly lacks in atmosphere if you are looking to stick around and eat what you order in the location.  It is tucked at the back of a convenience store with sparse, uncomfortable seating at the back.  Make plans to eat at your desk or elsewhere if you stop by.  Still, I give it five stars because it does what it sets out to do perfectly - offer fresh, incredibly delicious and healthy food fast and at a fair price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, albeit they are rather slow in preparing your order. Food is above average in taste, and good value for money, especially considering the location so close to Union Station.  We visited near close, and regrettably they had run out of a number of ingredients so couldn't offer half of the items on the menu. But considering that they were the only food store open in the area on a Saturday evening, that was understandable."}
{"text":"My go to for lunch.  Large selection at the salad bar.  Inexpensive salads.  You're charged by weight so I try to put more of the 'lighter' veggies in my take out box.    They have a special $5 sandwich every day of the week.  My favourite is there falafel wrap on Mondays, and Chicken Burrito Wrap on Fridays(?).    Tuesday and Friday they also have curry chicken and rice - $5 for a small.  Extremely spicy but delicious.  I'm willing to suffer through it every time.  Was addicted to their Thai Curry Soup for awhile too.    Also, I go for their $2.50 BELT sandwich in the mornings.    Have I made my point that this is the ultimate go to for quick food around the Yonge and Eglinton area?  Wendy, the cashier is extremely nice and friendly.  I look forward to seeing her every time! She also doesn't worry too much about change. Sometimes I don't have enough exact change, maybe 5 or 10 cents less and I'm trying to find a quarter, she would say don't worry about it.  When I find that quarter, I always drop it in the tip jar.  Really appreciate her friendliness and service."}
