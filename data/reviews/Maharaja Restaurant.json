{"text":"Yum yum yum! Great lunch buffet with many choices and flavors. Great for larger groups with ample space. Service very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian, worth visiting, but you might want to ask for more heat (flavor)!  Pros +Delicious flavors (we had the Mango Chicken and the Tikka Masala Chicken curries---even more delicious as leftovers a couple days later!) +Very nice atmosphere +AWESOME Towel service post-meal +Fun mocktail drinks (with accompanying handmotions from the waiter)  +Well seasoned (not too seasoned) paneer pakoras. VERY DELICIOUS paneer too!  Cons -Men's bathroom smelled a little funny, and the entrance door seems thin/light-easy to get hit by. This is a minor issue, though. -I asked for a good medium heat to my curry, not \"american medium\" but a \"strong medium,\" while my wife asked for mild. Our entries came out, and the plus was they didn't mix up our spice levels --- sometimes that happens --- but my \"strong medium\" was really like a mild, wasn't that spicy (but I do love spice, so be warned), while the \"mild\" was as bland as nearly any Japanese cuisine aspires to be for its \"subtle\" flavors. It was quite disappointing to miss out of the fullness of flavor that heat brings to curries. With a bit more salt and pepper (to try to bring some more heat out), the mild was made better, but perhaps the \"mild\" is perfect for people who really can't take ANY spice...however for people who are used to spice, but don't want \"burn your mouth\" hot, go for medium I would say.   Very good Indian restaurant, for two entries, (free) pappadams, paneer pakoras appetizers, and drinks around $45, not too shabby."}
{"text":"WOW! This place made me love Indian food.  I had three entrees with my husband and all were good.  I can't wait to go for the lunch buffet to try different things!  The staff was friendly and the place was clean and well pressed."}
{"text":"I am a regular here.  I usually order the tandoori chicken and a vegetable dish.  Chicken is always cooked perfect and the vegetable have a great sauce. Service is always quick and friendly. You can tell the place is well managed.   I recommend you trying this place."}
{"text":"5 for Madison, 4 for Chicago. So either way it's about as good as it gets for Indian food here. We first went to the one in Milwaukee, then moved here, and found out the place in Milwaukee, which we thought was awesome, had 2 more here. YAY! So we've eaten here a bunch of times, usually carry out, nice portions, the price isn't too bad for Indian, which from my experience tends to be high priced, low portions compared to other cuisine. We love the Tandoori chicken, the curry sauce which comes with it, good basmati as well, hard to make that bad. We love the veggie appetizer plate, which includes samosa which is very good, and others, we like all of them, probably the least favorite is the cheese thing. Pakora is great. We love the breads, we order on the side, stuffed naans, prathas, etc. All in all great Indian food for anywhere, still could find better in a larger city like Chicago, NYC, or LA, but this is bumble-f___, WI. So be happy there is some decent Indian food.  P.S. Also ate the buffet lunch one time, and it was a very good value, plus you get to try a whole bunch of different things you might not normally get to have. I suggest going at some point."}
{"text":"I would rate them on their food if they could deliver it! These clowns had me wait 50 minutes after I ordered before deciding to call me to tell me that they were too busy! Did someone displace my order? Why didn't you tell me that 50 minutes ago! Thanks for wasting my time, learn to run a business. I'm sure you tikka masala is amazing....."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, I got adjusted to that in a few moments. I found only 4 or 5 items in the buffet. None of them looked fresh. I tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Buffet variety is excellent. Taste is average by Indian food stds."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. Very attentive waitstaff. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Good service. Tandoori chicken was delicious with a little bit of kick. The sauce that came with it wasn't impressive but not bad. The lamb biryani was very tasty--moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"I ordered through \"Straight 2 Your Door\" when staying at a hotel in Middleton, WI. I had the Chicken Biryani and it was delicious. More chicken than in any other biryani I have had, and I have eaten in many Indian restaurants across the country. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS!!!  The buffets are great and so is any food you order off the menu.  I have never had a bad meal here before.  Every time we are in Madison, we stop by and have lunch or dinner or take an order out.  We are seriously going to miss Maharaja's now that we've moved to South Florida.  No Indian food lives up to this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch buffet! I came here with a friend and we each sampled the vegetarian offerings from the spread in the buffet room. Naan was fresh and warm, vegetable biryani was \"on-point\", and the assortment of spicy pickled onions, mango chutney and mint sauces were all very complementary with the salad.   For $10 a person, you really can't beat the quality of food for the price.   I'm very happy I finally tried this place out, after driving past on Odana forever.  Thanks Maharaja  -Victoria"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time about a week ago, during their lunch buffet and I was very happy that we chose this place!  I usually go to Taj on Park st. for Indian food because I love their pakora so much, but I will be going to Maharaja from now on!   The owner (I think he was the owner anyway) took the time to go around the entire buffet line with me to show me which dishes had animal by-products in them and which did not, and I was very grateful to him and happy to see that most of it was vegan friendly.  Unfortunately I really couldn't tell you the name of most of the dishes that I enjoyed, but there were several things on the buffet that were REALLY good. The one thing that stood out was a broccoli (and I think maybe eggplant) dish in a red sauce that was simply one of the tastiest things I have ever eaten in my life. Everything I had was good, except that the pakora was cold and soggy when I had it (but still better than the pakora at Maharina on West Wash!) so I wish they would find a better way to keep them hot, but everything else I had was hot and fresh and just fantastic.  The buffet was a little bit more expensive than I was expecting for a lunch buffet. It was $12 or so.  I also ordered the Masla tea with almond milk and that was really delicious as well.  On a side note, my friend that I was there with does eat meat and was just as happy with the buffet as I was, and she was totally geeking out over the Gulab Jamun which is a dessert that did look/sound really good. Apparently it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I moved into the Madison area just last week, and after hearing rumors about the spectacular lunch buffet at the Maharaja, I needed to try it for myself.  Suffice it to say that I was in no way disappointed.    I showed up to the restaurant at 2:55 this afternoon, with an entire 5 minutes to spare before the buffet officially closed.  Even so, the hot food was still hot, the cold food cold, and absolutely everything was extraordinarily delicious (and I would know - of course I had to try a bit of it all).  The waiters themselves were very polite and attentive, which I generally do not expect at anything that even resembles a buffet - not to mention when someone shows up 5 minutes before the meal *should* be over.  All in all, this experience alone was enough to inspire delight in my new Wisconsin home.  I look forward to finding the many other edible treasures that Madison surely has to offer, but I will most certainly be passing up more than a few meal opportunities to come back to this wonderful downtown diner.  - The New Madisonian  P.S.  They've also got free wireless.  Oh yeah."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Madison.  I've been coming here for the past couple years - the food is superb and only surpassed by the service.  On just my second visit, the manager recognized me and took the effort to have a conversation, learn my name, etc.  He's friendly every time I come in, treats me like a regular even if I haven't been around in a couple months.  He truly makes sure we have a great dining experience - and it's not just me, all customers seem to get similar treatment.  The food itself, I could go on forever - just try it yourself.  My favorites are the lamb vindaloo, madras, goat malabar, chicken saag, you can't go wrong.  Oh and the weekend buffets are a great way to try a bunch of delicious things too."}
{"text":"Indian food is my favorite cuisine and I have been to many different Indian restaurants around the globe.  I went for dinner service and though the the decor is dated, my boyfriend and I were beyond pleased with the entire experience.  Maharani is at the top of my list of exceptional restaurants.  The food was divine and the service was impeccable.  We had the samosa chat, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo curry, all of which were delicious.  The menu also consists of southern Indian cuisine which I will definitely have to try next time, as it isn't offered at most other Indian restaurants!"}
{"text":"they are so great! the staff is super friendly at BOTH the east and west side locations! the lunch buffet for $9.99 = amazing. the west side location is cuter, more niche, but i am a fan of both. the food is amazing, definitely get the bang for your buck. will definitely be back, time and time again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a friends recommendation. Woo hoo I was pretty surprised with the experience. I'm from bay area and have been to many indian restaurants. On my recent visit to Madison, WI I've been to Maharaja restaurant.   I ordered for Malai Kofta and aloo parathas that also came with a bowl of rice and a free desert(carrot halwa). I ordered it over the phone and went to pick up the food after an hour.   The staff were really friendly and have to mention the potions were more than usually I get for one order in bay area. Malai kofta was spicy and well made to my taste and I liked the rest of the food ordered that day.   Over all its a very good eating joint, good service, nice food and it was worth for what I paid for.  I will recommend this place to my friends :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Madison.  The buffet is amazing and the service is consistently top-notch.    They have some standard dishes on the buffet but also rotate through specials (especially on weekends).  I've never had something bad.  It is refreshed often and, as someone else has already mentioned, hot food is always hot and cold food is always cold.  My favorite dishes:  aloo gobi, aloo chole, and mutter paneer.  I love that they have a full range of items from nice crispy appetizers through to a great dessert selection.   I think the gulab jamun is probably my favorite but the semolina cake is also fabulous.  And the mango ice cream.  ...  I highly recommend going for lunch and skipping breakfast and dinner :D  I'm afraid I've never ordered off the menu or been there for dinner so I can't comment on that.  The price of the buffet is fantastic, especially given that you get to try so many tasty dishes, so I've never been tempted to try the menu."}
{"text":"I placed an order through delivery.com and waited 1.5 hours. There was no contact to suggest that my order would not be received or fulfilled, in fact I received 2 forms of confirmation. When the food had not arrived in 1.5 hours, I called the restaurant and was informed that delivery was not available nor had my food been prepared. Do not use delivery.com or order online if you hope to get your food. I cannot comment on the quality of the food as I had to eat frozen pizza."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for one reason. \"PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE\". They really don't care about their customers as they know they are one of the very few Indian restaurants in Madison.  Food is very ordinary and they cheat on their timings. They mention they are open till 10, but stop taking people and orders by 9:30. Let them rather put they are open only until 9:30. They need to learn proper business etiquette. People come for food and they just turn them down without any kind of considerations. I hope we get better restaurant in Madison and we avoid going there."}
{"text":"We ordered food for take out from Maharaja for a graduation celebration. The food and service were both excellent. Food was ready for pickup as planned. Food was freshly made and the quantity was more than generous for the number of people we had ordered it for. Everything we had was good but rasgulla was something special. It was the best we have ever had. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am basing this review on my delivery experience only (not on the food -- I yet have to taste it!). I ordered online almost two hours ago. I first called after 30 minutes of radio silence (they were supposed to call to process the credit card payment). At that point I was told my order would be delayed for one hour. Okay then. After waiting another hour, I called again only to be told that it would take another 20-25 minutes for my order to be delivered. WTH? Oh, and did I mention that they charge $2 delivery fee although my order was total was $38? We live two miles away. Most places deliver for free over $25. This whole experience is absolutely unacceptable and I will NEVER order from them again. Ever."}
{"text":"Not only my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison, but my favorite restaurant in Madison period.   Try the chicken moghlai or the shahi paneer, with kheer (rice pudding) for dessert.  Mmmmm.  There's also a tasty \"non-vegetarian dinner for two\" that makes ordering easy if you're not sure what you want.  If you go for the buffet, try to go on the weekend when the widest variety of dishes is available.  Also, the west side Maharaja on Odana is consistently a little better than the east side restaurant on Thierer, so be sure you're heading west for the optimal Maharaja experience."}
{"text":"A refreshing and pleasant option for Indian Food Lovers. Maharaja offers inquisitive options and top-of-line service. Run by pleasing staff and committed management, this place is certainly a must-go."}
{"text":"Ok Indian buffet. You are brought fresh naan. Ask for more fresh. Don't bother with the soggy naan at the buffet. Potatoes were hard. But lots of chutneys and chicken dishes. The carrot halwa was not so good, its better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have eaten in Indian places all over the country and this place ranks up there with one of the worst.  The wait staff is nice, the water stayed full, but the food is dead avg at best.  One of the reasons I love Indian food is the depth of flavor.  Last night I had to salt the lamb dish b/c it was so flat.  We have left overs which is usually a hot commodity for lunch the next day.  Neither one of us have touched them.  I've just moved to Madison and this is my first time here, but I don't envision returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've had better Indian food once or twice but it has always been in bigger cities and has been much more expensive. The food is great and I highly recommend the buffet. I have never found an Indian place that match the quality at this value."}
{"text":"I love the Indian buffet!!only on weekends and it cost 10 bucks,so very reasonably priced.  Tandoori chicken and naan is very good."}
{"text":"I have no words to describe this place. The food was just horrible. We should have just left after eating the Samosas. A place that can screw that up is definitely not worth going to. The rest of the food was crap too, including the water. Never going back here for sure."}
{"text":"I have had great experiences at this restaurant. I have only been for dinner and have not tried the lunch buffet.  My husband and I have been here four or five times since January, and the staff always greet us happily and provide excellent service. The restaurant also serves halal meat  Some of our favorite dishes are the tandoori mushroom appetizer and the palak kofta. We've also enjoyed the lamb dishes- including a recent lamb chop special that was delicious. I like the masala chai very much (and they frequently offer refills!) We also love the chutney appetizer that is always provided before dinner.   One warning is that the food is very spicy. I am sensitive to spice but can tolerate the \"medium\" spice level at most restaurants. The \"medium\" level at Maharaja is too hot for me. In fact, the first time I visited I ordered a medium vegetable curry but could hardly eat it. The waiter saw my eyes watering and re made the dish for me as mild. I always get mild now!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy! It's an Indian restaurant located within a Days Inn. I love it because it's so quirky. Go for the buffet. Don't bother with the menu. The buffet is just as unique as the location of the restaurant. They usually have several vegetarian options and some meat options also.   What makes this buffet so different is the fact that it has malai kofta, pickled toppings, and self serve mango lassi. I have never seen any of the above mentioned items on a buffet.  The taste is not the best and sometimes the food comes off as warmed over, but it is good and so much fun to stop in and stuff your belly with as much or as little as you like, all while sitting in such an unusual location."}
{"text":"One of the worse Indian food I have ever tried. I ordered Lamb Josh and the lamb was not well cooked and lamb biryani was also a big failure. Who the hell puts water chestnut in lamb biryani. The taste was also terrible. Will never go back :("}
{"text":"I went for their lunch buffet which was enjoyable. There was a nice selection so we left feeling quite satisfied.  It was worth what we spent but no dish in particular stood out unfortunately. Therefore three stars for ok food at a fair price."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was excellent with more choices than we had seen on other buffets. Both soups were delicious and there were several fish options. The owner was very friendly and helpful with our questions about the food."}
{"text":"I had Punjabi Saag and Shahi Paneer and both were delicious. I've eaten at Indian restaurants around the world and this is up there with the best that I've experienced. Staff very friendly and attentive. Right next door to an Indian grocery so I expected something really tasty and that's what we got."}
{"text":"All the previous reviews are spot on. We loved this restaurant, best Indian food we've had in years. We had cheese pakora, mulligatawny soup, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and aloo gobi. It was all delicious, but the tandoori chicken was the best.     And naan, can't forget that. Would definitely come here again. Friendly staff. We mentioned we were passing through and he said he knew we were newcomers, the others in the restaurant were regulars (some of whom were Indian,which is always a good sign)  Stop here for good food."}
{"text":"no one cared that i was eating.   nan was bad, and all torn up  when it came to my table. ( I went there for lunch buffet).   i guess the food the authentic so ill give it a 3 stars for flavors.  they get 0 stars for service and decor."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. This is serious tandoori goodness! Their Tikka Masala is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Food is very delicious. Rice quality is very good. No other restaurant in this locality serve this quality of rice. Tea is specialty. Service is very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Really excellent. My only suggestion for the restaurant: please serve red wine in red wine glasses. Otherwise a 5-star."}
{"text":"I often bring my wife and daughter here for the lunch Buffet. The reason I only come to the buffet is that my daughter and I can experiment with mixing the different sauces and trying new things since we're not very well versed in Indian cuisine. I don't know  nor care whether they are authentic because everything they have is pleasing to my palate. Wife really loves the saag. Service is always prompt."}
{"text":"It's kinda strange when you enter because you literally hit the hotel's registration counter, and then you wonder where the restaurant is because it looks like the hotel couldn't fit a restaurant.  It's to the left of the counter.    Anyhow, I have mixed feelings.  One, it's a huge buffet.  Two, it's cheap (8.99 for dinner, maybe 7.99? for lunch) and includes all you can drink soda, chai, etc.  Three, mango lassi is part of the buffet.  Four, the food on the buffet can be very strange.    So, pricewise, when you include free drinks/mango lassi, it's damn worth it, as long as you can find two or three other items you like.  On the other hand, you may not like anything at all on the buffet.    Their nan is average in texture but has garlic and herbs, so it's now foccacia nan and tastes delicious.  Papadum is done well.  Lamb kabobs are good, but I wish they had lamb curry.  Their selection of meat is small relative to the size of the buffet.  On the other hand, they have plenty of vegetarian items, but I prefer to avoid cream, butter and cheese that I didn't eat much of them.  I did try the spinach and they have the most wonderful version of spinach: it's cheesy spinach (but doesn't look like there's melted cheese in it).  Awesome.    But then again, their chickpeas were in a sauce that tasted like a combination of spaghetti sauce and ketchup-- yuck!  I suppose this place is geared to fat vegetarians who can have dairy.  Oh, and the atmosphere is pretty lonesome.  It was probably once the grand dining hall of the hotel and now kinda ghostly.  I think it's worth an initial visit and worth it for budget eaters."}
{"text":"I still love the food here, but frankly we most often eat at the East side location.  I recently had a http://restaurant.com certificate for this location, though, so we made the trek over.  I was not pleased with the way my certificate was handled- they shorted the credit by a few dollars, and when challenged, had some goofy excuse. Not sure how, but three reasonable adults still racked up a bill over $68 before tip and AFTER a $25 coupon.  I also didn't like that the gin and tonic I ordered was $7 each- for RAIL gin!"}
{"text":"Ordered Kadhai Paneer & Naan. The Paneer was extremely hard & did not taste authentic. Have had beter!"}
{"text":"Was here twice in the last couple months. Once for a lunchtime buffet, which was spectacular, and most recently for a quiet dinner for two.  I would give this place five stars if it weren't for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison I've noticed lately, the service is often mediocre, inconsistent, or just downright bad. Unfortunately, in this instance, Maharaja was no exception.  My dining partner and I were promptly greeted by a waiter at our table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over it, I indicated my indecision and told our server that we weren't in any rush. He must've taken that to mean to disappear for the next 30 minutes. During that time, my companion and I decided on an appetizer and I had some questions. Feeling like we were stranded on an island, I closed my menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That didn't work. Frustrated, we finally flagged someone over. I was irritated that I could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my meal selection.  After a bit of a communication issue over the menu, we each put in our individual dinner orders. My companion relayed the drink choice: chardonnay, plus a Coke for him. Seeming confused, the waiter attempted to clarify. I interjected with a chuckle, \"well, not in the same glass of course,\" referring to the soda and wine. Moments later, the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared to be a watery-Coke for him. It was obvious after the first sip: the chardonnay and Coke were indeed combined. Ummmm, did this just happen??!! Again our server remained MIA. Finally he returned with my companion's entree. But not mine. About a third of the way into HIS meal, my dinner finally arrived. Sorry, but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time.   Our service throughout the meal was spotty, with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that we showed up just as they opened at 5pm so the restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into our meal. The food was very good, and mine was nice and spicy as I had requested. Perhaps this was just a fluke, but hopefully next time the quality of food will match the level of service."}
{"text":"I had a seekh kebab as well as a chicken curry (I forgot which kind!) with a friend. Fantastic. They really know their way around flavors. I was basically enchanted the entire meal with what was going on in my mouth. Good portions too! We came at a good time when there weren't as many people and service was great and quick. Best if you enjoy food spicy!"}
{"text":"I think you would be hard pressed to find a better Indian restaurant in Madison. In fact some of the best Indian food I have ever had! The service was great and the atmosphere was a bit dark but cozy."}
{"text":"My husband & I used to love this place until we had takeout one night & found a dead roach @ the bottom of his briyani - can't eat there again!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but the staff always treats us like royalty.  I go in with my three young kids, by myself or to meet friends for lunch.  We are always greeted like old friends.  My kids love the chicken tiki masala, vegetable balls and mulligatawny soup--all mild.  I love the aloo gobhi and their lovely fried cauliflower in the sweet red sauce, among many other things.  Their chai is warming and good--just the right amount of sweetness and spice. Very family friendly.  The lunch buffet has a great variety of food."}
{"text":"You walk into the restaurant and the buffet looks really delicious with an overwhelming variety. The highlights were the mango ice cream, grilled fish, vegetable pakora and the homemade chutneys. The service was very friendly and attentive. The food is all way too mild. There should be, at least, one dish in an Indian restaurant that threatens to burn your face off. The dishes all look good but they left me very unsatisfied. In addition, all of the dishes seemed to be off temperature. It wasn't bad, but I am not ovewhelmed. The chicken tika masala was tough, the sauce was not thick enough and was, as I mentioned earlier, way too mild. I have a hunch, had I ordered off of the menu, the food would have been much better. The bread was more like pita and less like Naan and that's a shame because the bread is very important to me, for an Indian meal. There was a cabbage dish that verged on being fantastic. I probably will not have a Sunday afternoon craving for this place.  In the end, I found a few items that I liked, and I would probably give them another shot."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new Indian restaurant and found this place near West Towne Mall via Yelp :) Service was exceptional! I've been in the restaurant business for over 10 years and they went above and beyond what I expected for a small family owned business.    We came in around 6pm on a Monday night and upon seating our party of 3, the server set our napkins for us and made us feel welcomed. (The restaurant wasn't too busy that evening so my rating may be skewed because of that)  I didn't give them a full 5 stars because they were ALWAYS there at the table or near by. I would suggest to them to be able to \"read\" the table better and adjust their services accordingly. But I definitely give them credit for being courteous and anticipating our needs, like asking if we'd like more rice.   Food was delicious, spices were just right without being too spicy. The chutney's served in the beginning of our meal were tasty as well. We ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh, Lamb Masala, and Chicken Vindaloo. The meats were very tender and the curries were tasting light. We also ordered chapati and the plain naan which were amazing! This was the best naan I've ever had, texture was light and airy, so soft it melted in your mouth! We had Mango Lassi's to drink and complimented the spicy notes in our food. The Lassi was not too sweet and perfectly tangy. Pleasantly, at the end of our meal they brought out clean hot towels for us to refresh our hands with.  We had leftovers and to my surprise the next day, the server had put a scoop of rice in the container for us to enjoy with our leftover curry!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To start out, I can only really rate the food as I have only ever used the carry out option. As far as that goes, the experience I had was excellent. The food was ready on time, order was correct, and everything was hot and smelled wonderful.  It was everything someone can hope for when ordering food for carry out.   Now onto the food, quality of the dishes was great, and the overall flavor was intense. I do mean intense, I have never seen my friend or I go through so much water in one meal.  It was actually quite hilarious, because the first few bites it was \"alright, this isn't too bad\" few minutes later \"I might be regretting this\". So it is a slow burning heat that strikes with a vengeance. Thank goodness for the marvelous Naan and rice. This is my cautionary tale for anyone who is on the fence and worried about heat or has a low heat tolerance."}
{"text":"I am a believer! I finally got to try the buffet. Let me tell you, if eating until it hurts is wrong, I don't want to be right! They had all the staples (Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala) as well as some new items I've never tasted. Chicken 65 was the most notable - kinda like crunchy bite size pieces of Tandoori Chicken, except spicier. Dessert didn't dissapoint either; there were at least 5 you could pick from. The most notable were the Mango ice cream and Carrot Halwa.  Note: Lack of Samosas and Palak (Spinach) Paneer didn't push my rating to a 5. There is hope, however! I did go on a Thursday for the lunch buffet; the weekend buffet is supposed to have more offerings."}
{"text":"Be very careful if you are using restaurant.com coupon . We were added 11 dollars of gratuity to our check without notice, and when asked about it, manager started talking very rudely. Food was also not good, it was kind of ok. And vegitarians beware, we ordered baby corn Manchurian, but got lamb Manchurian. Server was sorry and replaced it with gobi Manchurian . Not recommended, there are other much better indian restaurants in Madison"}
{"text":"Overall a good place; a lot of selections and even had ice cream and a good amount of dessert. curry was a bit watered down, but still edible. Had the lunch buffet, was probably the most worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time while visiting a friend, and I must say this place is pretty good. I'm a fan of indian food by far, and this place rocked.   The only gripe I had was that they had a batch of Basmati rice on the buffet for a while and when I put it on the plate it was too crunchy. I told them about it, and thy immediately put out another pot of rice which was fresh.  The mango ice cream was out of this world.  I like this place, and would return"}
{"text":"Dissapointed. Food was decent but really not distinguished from any other Indian restaurant around Madison. Service was not notable. After the meal the owner refused to honor a gift card that we had purchased with only the explanation that \"We do not accept these anymore.\" Did nothing to make up for the situation and was fairly curt about it. Restaurant was nearly empty on a Sunday at dinner time; we likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! great buffet for a very reasonable price. i wish i could go more often!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and plentiful. The two person plates could definitely feed 3-4 people. I would say the Chicken 65 and the Garlic Naan were a little salty, but otherwise yummy. The service was excellent. They allowed us a substitution for the Lamb Curry on the non-veg plate and gave us an extra dessert after noticing we were arguing between two choices. We asked for our dessert to go because we were so full. Not wanting us to leave without dessert, the server brought us each out a raas gula which was amazing."}
{"text":"Maharaja is my favorite place in Madison for Indian food.  OK, now I'll tell you why. Maharaja produces some of the highest quality and most consistently good food in Madison. The lunch buffet can be a bit spotty, but the last two times I've been there the selection was plentiful and tasty. Dining there or for take out, the food is the same. I've never been unpleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  I have made it a point to try a new dish on a regular basis. I have yet to find a curry (with or without meat) that failed to please me. The aroma of the food is what draws me in. My most frequent comment about the food is that, \"it's like eating flowers.\" You can smell as well as taste the various spices in the curries and other dishes at Maharaja.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a bit odd. It looks like it used to be a 1970's or 80's supper club. Not exactly what you would expect for an Indian restaurant. The service is very good. The waiters are courteous and attentive. They don't hover yet I don't have to go looking for them when I need something."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate, this is where you want to eat lunch. Just go there. Trust me. I am an Indian food fanatic, and this place is one of my favorite restaurants of all time! We were just visiting Madison for the weekend, but Maharaja lunch buffet is one of the many reasons I will be returning to this great city! At first I was disappointed that the buffet did not feature saag paneer (my favorite) but let me tell you, everything was amazing. I am kind of glad there was no saag paneer because I ended up trying a lot of dishes I had not tried before. There was not one single thing that was not delicious. Everything was spiced perfectly, just the right amount of kick. There was a desert soup - coconut pistachio - that was amazing. As a vegetarian, and a lover of scrumptious foods, this place was a delight. It is about 10-15 minutes from downtown if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"The food and the service were good. Albeit, I didn't find anything exceptionally good. You can try this place if you are craving Indian food."}
{"text":"This is pretty close to where we live so we eat there quite a bit. Freshness of food really is hit or miss. I like all of the veggie options there. I think it's a great place to take someone who has never had Indian food. Buffet style lets someone new to this kind of food try a bit of everything. The mango lassi is always delicious! I like that it's NEVER busy, crowded or loud. Anytime we want to to relax for weekend lunch, we head there for the chilled out environment. They are currently undergoing a remodel, so I am looking forward to seeing what it looks like when they are finished."}
{"text":"Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn't fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good, the naans (when fresh) were good, but mostly it all stunk."}
{"text":"If the important things about buffets are the quality and variety of food stuffs, this place definitely has the latter. I couldn't help but try nearly everything; 3 plates and 2 dessert bowls later, I successfully gathered my parts together in time to write this review before falling into a very long nap.   There was an appetizer table with fried goodies, chicken cooked at least 5 different ways, delicious veggie options, a soup bar, and a dessert table. Probably 6 different chutneys. I cried with delight when I spotted the idli and coconut chutney, and dosai with sambar. Seeing as those are some of my favorite Indian food items, it was hard to hold back.   Late Sunday after noon, customers were still filing in on the regular. A wide range of people were dining here, from couples to families to large groups of students. It seems like they have plenty of regulars and a very diverse crowd at that.   M- F $9.95 for the lunch buffet, and Sat /Sun will set you back ~$11.95.  LaterzZzzZZz."}
{"text":"Good, quick, tasty Indian food. They always have the buffet going and it's great to stop in and grab a quick belly stuffing. It's tucked inside a days inn of all places but location is of no concern. Very wide range of food and sides. So, so good. Decent prices too. Always friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first less-than-stellar review on Yelp, but the last time I went here, nobody was satisfied.  We have been before for the buffet (which if I remember well was pretty decent).  So we went for dinner when my parents and brother visited me in Madison.  I don't remember exactly what I got, but it was a vegan dish with peas as a star.  What I do remember is how very bland it tasted.  I'm no expert, but I'm also no stranger to Indian food.  The spicy tomato-y sauce that is a base/part of many dishes was water-y and lacked flavor.  I even ordered it \"medium\"!  My family all had similar complaints, though they all tasted mine and agreed that it was the worst of the four.  I t was very unfortunate because I LOVE Indian food.  And I love peas.  And I have generally liked the two in Madison, but this fell very short."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, with very attentive staff.  Service was prompt and courteous. Rather large menu, with something for everyone.   I has the Paneer Masala Dosa, which came with there sauces; coconut, a cold tomato based one and a spicy bean.  The portion was huge and delicious.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and I used yelp to find a good Indian restuarant.  I enjoyed this place and if I find myself in Madison again, I would definitely go back.  The atmosphere:  Sort of dark in the restaurant but it was well maintained and had a typical \"Indian Restaurant\" type decor.  There was Indian music playing but it was not too loud.    The service:  The service was very attentive.  My water glass did not go empty.  My food arrived very quickly (almost too quickly as I had just been served the crackers with sauces/chutneys).  Several different waiters were working together to ensure that everything a diner could want was there.    The Food:  Very good.  I ordered the lamb vindaloo and asked for it \"hot.\"  Often when I go to Indian restaurants and say \"hot\" they actually serve it sort of medium.  This was pretty hot and my nose was running a bit and I drank a lot of ice water as well.  I also ordered a naan (with pistachios and raisins) and a mango lassi to drink.  I thought it was all quite good.  The only thing wrong was that some of the rice was a bit tough and hard.  I'm sure they would have brought me more rice but i just picked around it.  The amount of food was plentiful and I could only eat about half.   When I was finished with my meal the water brought me a small dish of mango ice cream.  It was a little icy but I thought it was a nice end to the meal."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT weekend buffet-- best assortment of high quality food I have seen in an Indian buffet and very reasonable price. I highly recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for buffets... Indian buffets take it to a whole nother level.  I have been here before for a \"work\" trip.  Last visit, I was probably hungrier than this past one, but I digress!    Maharaja had all the Indian bites that I crave - sag paneer, chicken masala, samosas mmmmmmm....  They also had some pieces I was not familiar with - chicken 65?  OK!  And since when is General Tsao's chicken considered Indian?  Whatever, I'll eat it =)  All dishes were pretty good, but since we were there towards the end of the buffet, the chicken dishes were a little on the dry side.  The desserts however, were enough to keep me coming back for more - literally.  Pistachio ice cream?  Mango ice cream?  Pudding-type thing?  Sweet donut hole? DONE! Definitely would want to go back here when in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great. Payment for the food and experience was terrible. Cashier was too lazy to accomdate our group with payment options and wanted us to spillting on our own bills. CHARGED  us for drinks and beers that we did not have, which equated to about 20 dollars. Was completely unreasonable! Will not go again for creating this terrible experience and very unaccomdating. And Charged us for drinks we did not have!"}
{"text":"This is one of those mediocre Indian restaurants that reek of complacency in just about everything they serve.I feel sorry for residents of Madison because there isn't a single good Indian restaurant in this city so they obviously don't know what they are missing out on.Fortunately 3 hours away in the city of Chicago you have the best Indian restaurants in the country AND cheap too.Thank god for that. The meat here isn't the best quality and definitely not fresh.Its frozen chicken.The biryani is a joke and more like a pulao.Service is slow but what will shock you the most are the prices.Wayyy overpriced for the mediocrity they dish out.Any Indian restaurant worth its salt that serves classic non-vegetarian food will NOT have south Indian cuisine on the same menu.That to me was a dead giveaway that food here was not going to be good and was I right. After dinner they were thoughtful to serve hot towelettes to wipe our hands with but one whiff and you could literally smell the dirty water they were washed in.Absolutely terrible experience.Will not go here again."}
{"text":"I couldn't possibly decide which is better,  the food or the service!   If I lived in the area, you couldn't keep me away!"}
{"text":"Madison Wisconsin is not a place one would figure for great Indian food, but there are some serious gems here! I love this place, after a day of shopping or a cheap movie, we often found ourselves here for dinner. The service is great, they put our napkins on our laps and brought us the warm towel after dinner, our water was never left unfilled, and they even chased me down with my coat once. I love the food, its so good it's hard to stop eating it. My boyfriend loves meat and I am a vegetarian, we both were pleased here and that can be hard to accomplish. We were always welcomed and fed well at a reasonable price. if you are near Odana and hungry, try it out."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice. Once for a lunch buffet and a-la-carte dinner second time.   Buffet was not great and dinner was terrible.   We had bhindi masala in dinner which was terribly cooked. I don't remember the name of other curry but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  You gotta go for the buffet so you can try a little bit of everything.  The paneer is the best!  The staff is super nice too."}
{"text":"LOVE the lunch buffet, I probably go once a week, but the dinners are great too, and you definitely get a lot of food with each order.  The restaurant is never very crowded, and once you get to know the waiters, they are EXTREMELY generous, and love to see familiar faces."}
{"text":"Great food. Really fresh. Incredible staff. My big complaint is that it's freezing cold inside. I'm always cold but even my dad kept his coat on during our meal. It's hard to completely enjoy a meal when you're shivering and watching your puffy sleeves to avoid stains."}
{"text":"The best Indian food and wait service I've ever had, from the complimentary papadums to the after dinner hot towel. Classy and very reasonably priced. Two nan orders, two entrees, for less than $40. Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good buffet on Sundays. Non-buffet foods are also tasty, but I prefer lots of variety in small amounts."}
{"text":"The hotel has a little listing for Maharaja which includes some pretty specific and weird hours, none of which include Mondays. I called on a Monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. I showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. Buffet closes at 9:30.  They didn't speak about, point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. I was immediately pointed to the buffet and told \"have whatever you want\" or something similar. There were 6 veg options,  4 meats (biryanis and curries), nan, poori and bhajis, kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, some good chai,  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.  Meals ends with mukhwa, but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls. The emphasis on customer self-reliance here could be construed as bad or lazy service, but I appreciate the lax environment."}
{"text":"I went here once, and I was very impressed.  I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food (prefer Thai), but they may be turning me.   Too bad it's on the west side..."}
{"text":"Known at best Indian in Madison. No much on atmosphere perhaps but crazy good food."}
{"text":"So I want to like Maharaja but I have a hard time doing it. I live very close to the restaurant and it always smells delicious from the outside. Plus, how can you beat a well priced lunch buffet?! However, I LOVE indian food and have had some terrific foods in other states and this just doesn't stack up. Their naan isn't quite fluffy enough (not sure they cook it in a tandoori) and their food is a little too one note and a bit on the heavy side."}
{"text":"The buffet was very good and had a huge selection, even for a vegetarian.   There is an entire dessert table, with half a dozen to choose from.  I do however like Indian food to be a bit spicier.  The restaurant is huge and it is good for large groups."}
{"text":"I went with the Mixed Grill and it was quite amazing and an okay value too. I chose a spicy level of \"Hot\" and it definitely had a good bite!  Only downsides are that Nan doesn't come with the meal, the service was subpar, and I had about half as much rice as I needed for the meal."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Madison! Muttar Paneer and Gulab Jamun are to die for! Great lunch buffet for like $10."}
{"text":"My son and I love to go for the lunch buffet often, if we don't have time to cook at home. It has been a great experience each time, staff is friendly and the variety of food is something we appreciate. I love that there is a selection of hot sauces to add the heat I want. It makes my day when I see the Carrot Halwa on the dessert menu!"}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet out there.  Excellent value for your money.    The service is outstanding as well..  Many of the employees recognize and remember regular customers.  An altogether memorable experience, every time!  Peter, who is Indian by ethnicity, and gets out there when homesick, or just sick of home food :-)"}
{"text":"Solid Indian food. The inner decor leaves a bit to be desired, but the food makes up for the presentation. The puris kept me coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"The good: Goat curry, lamb curry, fish curry, chana masala, tikka masala, garlic naan,  shrimp tandoori, aloo chole, sweet lassi, masala chai, kheer.     The bad: spice level isn't really profound.   This restaurant wasn't the best one in Milwaukee, that spot was kept for South 27th St. But in Madison, definitely the best, at least so far."}
{"text":"Visited from out of town. Needed an Indian fix! Went for the buffet. They had pani puris!! It was pretty good. Buffet had quite a bit of variety but I would like to try a meal if I visit next time. Usually buffet foods is not the greatest way to tell if an Indian restaurant is really good so if I were to go back I would definitely try and order a dish from the menu. The naan was really delicious. Customer service was awesome. 5+ for that!!"}
{"text":"Better than Swagat on Old Sauk for sure. And possibly better than Taste of India on Monroe!"}
{"text":"You know, I am usually highly suspicious of buffets.  I took microbiology in college, and really, it was enough to scare me away from buffets forever.  I'd almost rather eat off a toilet seat than a buffet.  That being said, the buffet at Maharaja rules!  I really always thought I hated Indian food, because I don't like curry.  I usually stick to tandoori chicken and the bread.  Last time I went, I got \"adventurous\" and tried the tikka masala.  YUM!  I also love those little balls soaked in syrup.  So, I tried other things too, like little veggie fritters and palak paneer.  I am also now addicted to mango lassis.    The staff is very friendly, and thankfully, keeps the buffet fresh.  This is one buffet I can't wait to come back to."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is good, lots of items. for $10 it worthes it! I love the mango Icecream especially. I love the goat meat stew, but I guess those are too expensive to have on the menu, they no longer offers sadly...."}
{"text":"I wanna gonna give 4 stars because the food was excellent BUT the service was terrible, so minus one star for that. The place was crowded and they didn't have enough waiters. When I asked the waiter to take a photo of me with the food, he said ok and never came back. When I asked for the bill, the waiter forgot. I ordered wine and they never brought it, I had to remind them that I had ordered wine. The food, however, was excellent. The daal was very tasty, and the chicken tikka makni was amazing. The mixed tandoori platter seemed really popular. I saw many people order plate after plate of meat on a sizzling hot plate, so I ordered it too and it was so tender (you get chicken, shrimp and beef). Bottomline: come here when it is not crowded."}
{"text":"Great food and great place. We had the calamari as appetizer and the non veggie combination for two people. That's a lot of food, I think that was enough for three people :). Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Maharaja was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to Madison from Long Beach/Artesia CA (where some of the best indian restaurants in the country are) and maharaja shot up to the top of my list. Wonderful buffet, predictably good, wonderful wait staff. I highly recommend Maharaja!"}
{"text":"I went back and the food was a bit greasy and the dosa seemed to have been sitting around before serving.  Still good though!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here.   We recently ordered some carry out and it was superb.  We ordered two different chicken curry dishes. The prices are a bit high but we are more than happy to spend more for good quality and Maharaja delivers.   The mango ice cream is delicious. The service was quick and very friendly showing interest in what we were doing the day we stopped by.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the background music very nice."}
{"text":"We missed the lunch buffet that we had heard so much about and went right to dinner.  We ordered six dishes for three adults and one kid.  The food was fantastic and flavorful, though the kid who was with us was VERY unimpressed with the exception of the Mango Lassi.  The big surprise came at the end when we got the bill and it was over 75 dollars!  Yowzers!  While the food was good, there wasn't a whole lot of it, so the bill was a bit shocking.  But don't let the cost of dinner detour you if you are looking for excellent Indian food, this place has got it, so go early and hit the lunch buffet instead."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. The food here was once great and the service.   The new owner is a con artist. We decided on the restaurant as a cater for our wedding. We had home made food and also Indian. We wanted enough food to feed half the guests. The owner persuade us to pay him to be there during the dinner even though we explained we could have had family help with replenishing food. We paid him the full amount he quoted up front. Long story short the guy demanded an additional grand in CASH at the end of the evening. He said his wife had to run repeatedly to the restaurant to grab more food because there wasn't enough to feed our guests. Of course no one kept tabs on how many dishes and how many times his wife left the venue.   We didn't understand how he could have added another grand worth of food when he was suppose to only feed half the guests and there were more than enough of the family food. We understood a couple hundred extra but not a grand. And why he demanded cash.   We tried explaining to him that you can't just decided to bring more and more food and then send a random bill to a client. But him and his wife argued that we are disputing because it is already said and done. I have never know of such a cater in America to pull such a scam. He would not let the argument go so we did end up paying half, $500. Please don't cater from this guy.   We did do our investigation afterwards and the grocery store owners around the area said he wasn't doing so well and have been looking for someone to purchase the restaurant.  I warn you to not support this guy. Please save yourself some stress and head ache. He is cunning. He use to own the grocery store on the east side and looks like that was working for him so he purchase this restaurant earlier this year. Looks like his cunning ways are catching up to him and this isn't working either. People like that don't last long in business."}
{"text":"Maharaja is a great Indian buffet restaurant. You can try anything or everything, quality is good, no waiting. The atmosphere is very utilitarian but friendly. A great place to take hungry college students who want some authentic ethnic food!"}
{"text":"Maharaja gets points for a friendly atmosphere and pretty good food, but gets dinged for not being as good as other places in terms of food quality.  I can think of at least two better options (Swagat, Minerva), so unless location/time was a primary factor in my decision, I would be hard-pressed to come here over those places.  The staff here is actually really great, and it really seems important to them that you enjoy your food.  I know it's a restaurant, but a lot of places seem to be a little bit cavalier about this aspect of it.  In my experience here, they're genuinely happy when you enjoy yourself, and I really appreciate that.  I will say that I enjoy the dessert table here a little bit more than I should (excellent kheer), and the comments others have made about the high quality of the rice are true as well."}
{"text":"The weekend lunch buffet is one of the best I've ever seen.  Huge selection of really tasty Indian food.    The menu also delves into southern Indian cuisine which I've never seen elsewhere.    The servers actually care whether you're happy and do a good job.  Like others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a little bizarre but the very diverse crowd usually dining there makes it feel like a 'big city' restaurant.    One of my favorites in Madison.  Did I mention that its cheap?"}
{"text":"About 15 years ago I tried an Indian buffet restaurant (in a different state and not related to this restaurant).  I disliked the food so much that it's taken me that long to even try Indian food again - and boy am I glad I was able to try again here at Maharaja's Restaurant!!!  We were looking for \"something different\" to eat on a late Sunday night - they are open daily until 10pm.  We were a party of four consisting of two middle aged adults with our \"kids\" age 27 and 18.  If you're in the mood for something quicker  - they also offer a lunch buffet daily.  The atmosphere was beautiful - chandeliers... white tableclothes... candles on the tabletops. Authentic yet subtle Indian music played softly in the background. The waiter put the napkins into our laps - very classy.  Before we went I had looked over the online menu (great descriptions and pictures) so I already had some idea of what I wanted - which made it easier than guessing in person.  Our waiter was very helpful in advising  my 18 year old daughter on what dish she might enjoy.  My son is a vegetarian and was impressed by the selection - the rest of us are not vegetarians and we were also impressed by the selection!  We would call this food \"cruise quality\" (back when that really meant something that is).  It was awesome and out of this world great.  We all took turns sampling each other's meals... which were served in individual serving bowls.  The dishes we ate were:  Beverages: Mango shakes (very unusual and refreshing - especially after a spicy bite of something) and Masala tea (sweet hot tea drink very similar to Chai).  Fresh glasses of ice water were automatically given and refreshed frequently.  Appetizers: (complimentary) Daal Poori (fried lentil bread) - think of this kind of like tortilla chips in a Mexican restaurant - crispy but with a different (but very tasty) flavor.  This was served with three different types of dipping sauces.  Pickles - these are not any ordinary 'pickles.'  This was very salty and unusually flavored with spices like corriander and chili powder .  We were told some of the ingredients included vegetables... green mango chunks... and some type of Indian fruit.  The piece I ate reminded me somewhat of olives only saltier and stranger.  Unfortunately most of us did not appreciate this dish - but the good news is it only cost .95 to try it.  (very salty and somewhat spicy)  Cheese Pakora - flat cheese that has been breaded and fried - tasty though reminiscent of tofu and/or fried chicken.  (not spicy)  Samosas - spicy turnovers stuffed with potatoes and green peas - mixed reviews - the men in our party enjoyed them more than the women did. (yes they were a bit spicy)  Soups:  S.O. had the Mulligatawny soup - it's made with lentils and vegetables and has an unusual spicy flavor and topped with a bit of cilantro.  Very good with the lemon squeezed into it.  I felt it was somewhat reminiscent of a granular pea soup.  It had a little kick to it.  (somewhat spicy)  The three others of us had Coconut soup - sweet and creamy warm soup with shredded coconut and pistachios.  Daughter felt it \"reminded her of Christmas.\"  I think perhaps it reminded her of eggnog in a way - similar comfort level but different taste. (sweet not spicy)  For breads we tried plain Paratha (similar to a thick wheat tortilla) and the garlic Nan - it was extra super garlicky and tasty.  (neither spicy)  Our meals were served with a large bowl of long grained rice for us all to share.  We were given a choice of spice levels from mild to hot.  1) Beef Jalfrazie (beef curry with various vegetables); 2) Chicken Tiki Madras (tomato/curry base with coconut - from Southern India)  (3) Vegetable curry (stir fried medley with curry sauce) and I indulged myself in a decadent special of the day 4) Tandoori Lobster (spiced lobster tail cooked in a high heat pressure type cooker called a Tandoor oven).  We all tried each other's dishes and each was enjoyed by all.  My (mostly) vegetarian son even snuck in a bite of lobster! :)  (none of the entrees seemed too spicy for us)  Even though we were stuffed and had leftovers - we knew we \"had to\" have desert.  Daughter opted for the Gulab Jamun (also called 'waffle balls') - sweet fried dough balls covered in a rosewater syrup.  Was reminiscent of perhaps pancakes with syup or cobbler - but of course with a different flavor.  We were very impressed with the kulfi - a sweet custard-like ice cream made with pistachios and almonds.  The staff was very friendly and kind - answered all of our questions with patience and care... helping us throughout the evening to get the best meal possible.  To top the evening off - the waiter brought us all hot damp washclothes for our hands.  What exemplary service and attention.  Dinner for the four of us came to a bit over $100 plus a tip - which seems very reasonable for the amount of food we ate - plus leftovers.   Fit for royalty!  I highly recommend Majaraja restaurant anytime. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty sure the chef doesn't know how to make Indo-Chinese food. We ordered the Gobi Manchurian and the Paneer Chilly entree, and all we got was some concoction heavy on tomato ketchup."}
{"text":"I am giving Maharaja five stars because I really have nothing bad to say about it!  When in Madison, I frequent Maharaja and Maharani for my Indian cuisine cravings.    Here is why:  -they are both reasonably priced.  -they are both rediculously yummy (read: I love the fish masala)  Here is why I think Maharaja takes the cake (and is better than Maharani):  -the service at Maharaja is GREAT.  The host/waiter always remembers us when he comes.  It is a touch like that which will bring customers back consistently, and I know we always appreciate it."}
{"text":"Still looking to be blown away by some subcontinental food in Madison but it has yet to happen. Someone needs to sack up and bring some heat to the table, I feel like I'm back in England with all this bland tikka masala.  I've been here for the lunch buffet and it is pretty standard. The panak paneer, naan, and channa daal are probably the highlights. Steer clear of the fish completely and any of the fried food unless you are there at opening time"}
{"text":"Went with my brother who was in town, on a Saturday night.  We were seated right away, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  The waiter took our order right away and recommended an Indian beer for my brother that was good.  Bro had lamb curry and was worried they wouldn't make it hot enough, but he was very happy with the spiciness (he ordered the \"hot\" level\") and said it was perfect.  I ordered the aloo chole (chick peas, tomatoes and potatoes in sauce)  and it was yummy as hell.  Portions are large but not ridiculous.  Our bill was very reasonable (about $40) for the quality and amount of food and having ordered drinks.   The atmosphere is not distracting or loud which is my main desire as far as ambience in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Muy rico!! Is good food, good flavor and different. The service is good and very politte. Very good desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The meal was delicious and came out quickly. The waitstaff was very friendly and patient. Defiantly would recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious. We ordered dinner take-out, the Tikka Masala and Aloo Ghobi, both of which were fantastic. Naan delicious as well. Priced the same as all the other Indian around. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I was looking for a great place for dinner with the bf and found this place; we ended up going there for the lunch buffet.    When you first walk in, the place looks a little on the fancier side and I had jeans and t-shirt on so I sort of felt a little under dressed.  After looking around though it was more that they just had nice decor because everyone else seemed really casual too.  Their lunch buffet is $8.95 and completly worth it.  everything that I had was so good and flavorful.  They also had so many different varieties!!  I had the mango drink which tasted like a fresh squeezed mango, fresh!  For dessert I went with mango again and had the mango ice cream, cold!  That was good too.    All in all i highly recommend this place.  It was the only meal me and the man ate that day but it kept us full the entire day.  Ooooh and the naan is included in the buffet too!"}
{"text":"Food here is very delicious. I come here for lunch buffet everyday and enjoy each time. They have lot of options in buffet and have different options everyday. Dal tadka and cholle is my favorite here and the special TEA is exquisite in taste.  The customer service is very good. Angelo is very friendly and kind.  The ambiance of the restaurant is impressive. They have indian music/songs running in background at low volume."}
{"text":"PROS: Great curries, naan, and basmati  CONS: Grilled fish  The restaurant would've received a 4-star rating, if all we ordered was the shrimp and fish curries and the naan bread --- which were solid. However, the grilled fish was completely dry, tasteless, and virtually inedible. They took a really nice piece of fish and destroyed it... If you ever come here, be sure to stick with the curries and other moister/saucier dishes."}
{"text":"Place is straight up delicious.  The beef saag is the best in town easily! I've eaten at a lot of Indian joints and this one far surpasses any and all"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken Vindaloo. Great tea! Nice service, beautiful presentation. Good place, very reasonable."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we found a great Indian restaurant just 5 minutes from our hotel. We were in town for the Great Taste of the Midwest and needed some food after several hours of beer drinking. This place filled the bill. We started with the best samosas I have had - large and crispy with a very flavorful filling. All 3 of us really enjoyed our main courses. I had a lamb dish with tomatoes and mushrooms, husband had chicken tikki masala and daughter had paneer. I liked that they cooked the food to your spice level. We also had excellent naan (garlic flavor was the best) and basamati rice. Service was excellent and very prompt. We enjoy several Indian places in the Chicago area, and this was as good if not better!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Seriously. I live in an area with a large Indian population, and with really great places to eat. I went to this restaurant while in Madison on business. I was floored. Everything from the papadam and chutneys to the masala tea at the end was delicious. I had the lamb vindaloo, hot. The gravy was thick and spicy, and the lamb was tender. Naan was perfect. For desert masala tea and gulab jamun, both were outstanding. Service was attentive, friendly, and we were provided with scented hot cloths to clean after eating. My only wish was that they served their dishes thali, but I left so stuffed that I really didn't need it. If you are in Madison and like Indian food you must give them your business. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tis delicious. They've made an awkward space work. Their chicken 65 is more flavorful and much bigger than Maharani's. I also enjoy their chicken malai more. Chicken Tikka Masala is also delicious but Maharani wins in this category. The gulab jamun is more eggy flavor here and the mango ice cream is not as creamy.   It's great but not as great as Maharani."}
{"text":"The beginning of 2013 brought many resolutions my way (all of which I have kept thus far, thank you very much). One of those said resolutions was to try Indian food.  Wow. Have I been missing out. I am a fan of heat and spice. I find myself trying to find the next hotter sauce/spice. While I am not sure what it was, I think I found it. I found my breaking point in hot sauces. That alone will bring me back somewhere.  Having gone on a Friday with a group of woman from work, I really had no idea what i was getting myself into for the lunch buffet. But I decided, heck, I'll try it. Worst case scenario I am out $10. Plus, I figured I had the chance to just try small bites of something I have never had before.   Everything was warm/hot and nothing was sitting out for too long. I wish I could tell you everything I ate, but the two things that really stood out for me were the Tikka Masala and the sausage made with lamb (Which should really say a lot coming from someone who is a faux-vegetarian).   The only thing that brings down my rating is the decor. I felt like I was walking into a 1980's banquet hall. Besides that, the staff was incredibly kind and helpful. Especially when I started to cry from whatever spoonful of hot sauce I foolishly poured down my throat.   Will I be back? You betcha. Will I eat whatever magical sauce I ate that day? Darn right. Will I get the buffet? No. Because I like myself and like to be able to breathe after I am done eating."}
{"text":"Can be better if they put bit more attention to finishing foods and customer needs...masala tea is ofcource nor good"}
{"text":"We love this place for some reason.  We've been to India Garden, Taj Mahal, Tamarind, and Flavor of India.  I'll admit that sometimes it's really great and sometimes it's just good, seems to depend who is doing the cooking.  The service is pretty much non existent, which I'm fine with, don't have to leave a tip!  So for $9 or so you get a nice lunch or dinner buffet with mango lassi, pop, and chai tea included."}
{"text":"From a true indian food crazy person ! Don't go here - they do tempt you with loads of options but none are made to taste well. The dal makhani reminded me of my hostel mess. The rice was not well cooked. While eating idli I had to struggle as it was too hard. The veggies were over cooked. I am giving it two stars for good deserts."}
{"text":"Don't let the empty parking lot and smallish looking restaurant fool you - this is some of the best Indian fare (and dining experience) you'll find in Madison.  I'll admit...seeing the place from the outside didn't have me convinced, but since when did I start going to restaurants for their outdoor decor?  The night 3 of us went for dinner, the place was empty, not another soul there.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating right off the bat, getting us situated with a table and bread before we had a chance to take our coats off. I love free stuff.  At one point during the evening, we had 3 separate folks waiting our table...talk about service. All very friendly, trying to be helpful and clear things quickly.  I didn't order a drink like my other two compadres, but the staff brought out chai for me, without asking, on the house.  It was phenomenal. And free. They had me at \"on the house.\"  Down to the food - everything was incredibly flavorful.  Our table had 2 chicken dishes (1 curry), 1 veg dish, and 2 sides of nan.  The chicken was done perfectly and melted in your mouth.  Portions are plenty big. We ate more than we should.   In short, these guys know what they're doing.  Go."}
{"text":"I soooo didn't want to eat here but was kind of peer pressured into it. I was really afraid of what I would get at a Wisconsin Indian restaurant next to a hotel. I was happy to be proven wrong. This was one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to. There were awards all over the walls that showed just how awesome everyone else thinks Maharaja is as well. I split a samosa, the chicken 65, an order of keema nan and lamb moghlai with the BF. The appetizers were all good but not worth finishing. What was amazing was the keema nan and the lamb. I mean they were out of this world delicious. The lamb could have been a little spicier but that was our fault since we were being little chickens and didn't say to make it spicy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who finds themselves in Madison and searching for something exciting and delicious to eat."}
{"text":"The service is great - very nice staff.   The food is okay - probably some of the best in Madison, but not excellent.  We usually get the chicken makhani - which is the best dish we've found.  The tikka masala is alright - not great.  The naan and paratha are good."}
{"text":"Woe is me, what took me so long to discover this place? And to think, all the times that I've craved Indian food, Maharaja was just a short drive away...  My friend and I ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild), the fish curry (medium), and the regular naan. Our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney (onion and cilantro). While the portions are small, the food is very filling - probably on account of all the carbs! :P  As for our dishes, the chicken was a little tough, but otherwise well-seasoned. I really enjoyed the creamy tomato base, and I was glad that I ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish curry was REALLY spicy. I was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic/ginger sauce, but I could only take so much heat. :(   Service was impeccable. Our water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them. The staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining experience.  Just an FYI, the online menu is a little outdated. I wanted to order the chana masala but it wasn't an option on the restaurant menu. Fortunately, you really can't go wrong with any of the curries or masalas! Give 'em a try! :)"}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant. They have a great affordable lunch buffet which is always freshly stocked and yummy. Great vegetarian options on the buffet and the menu. They are very kid friendly and dont give you the evil eye when your kid makes a little mess with the rice. The wait staff is very helpful and on top of things. The food is awesome! I cant say enough about this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was fine.   Decent food but a little pricey for the genre. I enjoyed the chappata. Service was fast. The tableware was lovely. The atmosphere is a little duct tape and spackle-y for $15 plates. The food was tastey but bland for what I expect. Everything tasted a little the same. The rice was well done."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. You are missing out if you don't try this place. It has the best Indian food with amazing service.   All I can say is the next time you want to grab food, come here and you will leave happy and stuffed.  We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here. The service is always excellent and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The tandoori chicken is amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a rough Saturday and decided to treat myself to some Indian food and so I decided to give them a shot.  They have the most amazing samosas I have had at an Indiana restaurant. Rich and flavorful with just a hint of a kick. I'd rate that 5 out of 5.  Their chicken tikka masala and the naan were good. All told 4 out of 5.  I will definitely be coming back and soon. Probably to lunch buffet to try more of what they have to offer as the price for their lunch buffet is one of the more reasonable I've seen in Madison."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Madison. This is my happy place. The dining room is always filled with other happy Madisonians mowing on Indian. Maharaja - do it. And be sure to order the masala tea."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, the staff pleasant.  The food was a little bland for my taste.  Perhaps they were catering to a more mainstream crowd but I prefer my Indian dishes to have a little kick to them, especially the Saag Paneer :)  They didn't have as large a selection as I'm used to at the Indian restaurants in Los Angeles.  I won't totally discredit them, but couldn't offer up 5 stars either.  I'd say give them a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"I love this place! Nice and very friendly staff. My sister is a regular (and I would be if I lived on the west side!).  If you're craving Indian and do not know what to order, the lunch buffet is where it's at!  I'm one of those picky types, where decisions are difficult for me, so a buffet is perfect.  Plus, if you're not familiar with Indian food, then it would no fun if you chose something from the menu and ended up not liking it!  And this place crushes all stereotypes of a buffet. It always is clean, the food is ALWAYS fresh (no crunchy rice), and they serve a wonderful variety of dishes. Chicken masala is my favorite with the vegetable fritters.   And they always bring the naan out right away, and it's so warm...mmm, just what you need on a cold day!  Cheap too, I always leave stuffed and ready for a nap!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff were very nice. I ordered for carry out and they gave me a delicious chai while I was waiting for my food. Nice gesture!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  A diamond in the rough.  Thoughtfully prepared food and sincerely awesome service that makes you feel like royalty...and I'm not even Indian.  The AmericInn across the street is also top notch, since they have a happy hour from 5-7pm with FREE beer, FREE wine, FREE nachos w/ jalapeños, AND FREE appetizers.  If you live in Madison, I suggest you drop whatever you're doing and go to Maharaja for dinner tonight! :)"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch buffet on a Sunday, and we practically had the place to ourselves. There was a huge variety of foods on the buffet, with about a 50/50 split of meaty vs. vegetarian options. Most of the items weren't super spicy, which I'm sure they have to do on the buffet to meet most people's preferences. They bring naan to your table, and it is excellent! Tender yet chewy, and slightly buttery. YUM. Also, don't miss the mango ice cream, it is incredibly delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place does leave something to be desired, but I have always left relatively satisfied. The food isn't quite as good as India Garden, but the buffet selection is bigger, and it's less expensive. With Indian food, I only eat bread and meat dishes, they usually have 4 meat selections:  chicken curry, chicken in a cream sauce, a grilled chicken with spice, and the 4th varies. Overall, worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best garlic naan in Madison!!! I've lived on NYC and I know good Indian, this place impressed me with their variety and flavor. Buffet was so large I did not get to try all the selections. Looking forward to going back. Also, great service with a smile!"}
{"text":"*Great service-friendly but not talkative, water glasses re-filled pronto, polite. Too fast for my tastes, I don't like ordering my meal while enjoying an appetizer. *Very good food-Not the best Indian I have had (but I have had a lot so I am a bit snobby I think), but it was really very good. I suspect it does not get much better in Wisconsin. Serving was adequate, but a bit small. Samosas were very good (a bit dry). Great sauces! WARNING: NOT SPICY! Ask for extra spicy if you want any spice at all. *Terrible dessert-mango ice cream- it was old and had freezer burn!  *Prices were a bit high given the quantity and quality of food. *Full bar. Wine list was minimal but adequate. Pours were friendly. :) *Atmosphere-Romantic, med-low lighting, quiet when not too busy, cloth tablecloths. *Too bad the (apparent) manager made a comment about my partner and my own Indian \"costumes\" and mentioned that we must \"feel different\" because we were wearing traditional Indian attire...otherwise this would have been a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"I've only had Indian food on a few occasions, and most of it was either homemade by friends or limited to appetizers.  I was excited to try Maharaja because I had heard good things and it would be a new experience.  They for sure do not disappoint.  We walked in to a quiet restaurant with only a few patrons for a late dinner, and were greeted by polite hosts, servers, etc.  Upon seating us, they pulled the chair out for my fiance and set her napkin which I thought was a nice touch.  We mentioned to the server that it was our first time there and asked for some recommendations and he was very responsive.  He suggested an appetizer, the samosa, which was absolutely delicious.  He also recommended that for our meals we try the Mixed Grill and the Tikki Masala Chicken with Garlic Nan bread.  And to throw a little sweet into the mix with a Mango Milkshake smoothy.  We did all of the above and it was fantastic.  Other waiters were prompt on getting us water, and there was only about 10 minutes between the appetizers and the meal which was a good amount of time to let things settle.  We also had some bread crisps with three different kinds of chutney to sample while we waited.    Overall, one of the best experiences I've had in Madison at a restaurant, I highly recommend.  I'm going back soon to try their $9 lunch buffet as it looks like the same food albeit at a more affordable price (dinner entrees are normally in the $$ range)"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is great for a group or just a couple.  The food is wonderful and consistent.  If you always wanted to try Indian food but are afraid you'll order something and not like it, fear no more!  The buffet is a wonderful way to try a myriad of representatives of this fine international cuisine.  This is a favorite of my family and my coworkers (and I work with a large number of Indian citizens!)"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I have ever had, including frozen dinners. I ordered via GrubHub and purposely elected to pay the tip in cash. I'm glad I did because the delivery driver was unbelievably rude, practically threw the food into my husband's hands then turned right around and left. The food itself was terrible. The chicken was full of bones and nasty, chewy tendons and fat. The only discernible flavor in the sauce was tomato paste, it was otherwise completely flat. The naan was burned in some spots and cold in others. I honestly can't imagine how this passed for food."}
{"text":"As a relatively new Indian food addict we've been trying out a few spots in Madison and finally made it here on a Friday night.  My review is a 4 due to the food receiving a definite 5, but the actual venue being more of a 3!    Food was outstanding...we had tandoori mushrooms, a tandoori sampler main dish and chicken madras with garlic naan.  It was all equally fantastic and some of the best indian food we have had!  Prices were as expected for dinner with us both having a drink our bill was $55.  We will definitely be getting food from here again (possibly delivered).  The restaurant left something to be desired...dated interiors, cheesy plastic flowers on the tables, dead silent (no music) so it's awkward unless the restaurant is packed.  The bathrooms are pretty bad too.  Overall...I would call this a dive indian place...worth the lackluster interiors for the dynamite food!"}
{"text":"im not indian... but i've tried really good indian food and this place is pretty good!  i always get the the two dishes that can never go wrong which is the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken ( sorry if i spelled that incorrectly) anyways this place also has really good rice, its actually flavored  overall my favorite place to eat in madison so far"}
{"text":"Go here frequently for the weekend lunch buffets. Always have a great selection to choose from and great tasting food!"}
{"text":"I have sampled pretty much every Indian eatery in the Pittsburgh area, and hands down, this is as close to an authentic Indian meal that I have found. The price is reasonable and the food is consistently tasty. The buffet typically has a wide variety of items to choose from and includes mango lasse and hot chai tea. It's not a typical setting for such a culinary find, but don't let that keep you from trying their fantastic cuisine."}
