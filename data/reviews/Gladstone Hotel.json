{"text":"Love the Melody Bar. They've had some great bands there.   Going to see the best Fleetwood Mac tribute band here on March 21. I've seen this band before. Awesome. 
Called Fleetwood Mix. Worth seeing."}
{"text":"Was here last Sunday for brunch and have to say it the experience was rather disappointing. 

When we arrived we waited a few minutes at the door for the hostess who didn't seem busy enough to ignore us. We were then seated at a table right in front of the door, high traffic area, and there were clearly other seats in the back. When we asked to move she said once the table beside us was vacated we could move there. Rather rude to both parties.

Again on poor service, took awhile to take drink orders, took 10 minutes to receive said drinks. The caesar is small for the money, the Drake serves a better tasting caesar, in a taller glass, for less money. 

I did really enjoy the huevos rancheros, the black beans and feta are sandwiched between 2 toasted tortillas and the eggs and salsa on top were delicious. My husband did not enjoy his eggs benny as much. He was also disappointed that they used to offer chorizo as a meat on the benny but today it was only bacon. 

Finally when it came time to pay I showed my Live Green card which the site clearly indicates gets 10% off dine in. The staff not only didn't recognize it but seemed put off by my request. The manager granted the discount and took a picture for future reference. 

The Gladstone is a beautiful spot but there are much better brunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"Get ready for the slowest brunch service in the city. Our group came in at normal sunday brunch hours and we ended up waiting 45 min for three plates of food. Its not like we are getting slow roasted food. We were getting three plates of eggs. Someone needs to teach the kitchen how to cook more then 1 egg at a time."}
{"text":"Just took in brunch today at the café... can't remember what it's called (the other side from the Melody Bar)... anyway... it was great. 

The Gladstone kitchen has been serving better-than-average-hotel/bar fare for a while (those french fries, the roasted nuts... all good stuff) but I have to say, my brunch food was spot on. 

I had the Huevos Rancheros and this dish is often massacred by kitchens that think mixing salsa with eggs makes it \"Rancheros\". Not so the Gladstone--they really used the soft corn tortillas, chilli, and fresh salsa to make a great egg dish.

The room was bright and clean (if a little hot), service was fast fast fast and friendly. Good music (don't bring grandma)... and a good looking crowd--shallow? yes, but don't pretend it doesn't matter ;-)"}
{"text":"great ppl, great architectural rooms"}
{"text":"I really like the cafe...I can sit at the bar and read the NY Times with a tasty beer at basically any hour of the day surrounded by big windows and exposed brick (it's a little 70s NYC, but whatever)...it's terribly civilized.

...and while everyone compares it to the Drake, it reminds of the Ace Hotels in Portland, OR and elsewhere."}
{"text":"I waiver back and forth on the Gladstone. The first time I was here we went for lunch with friends at the Café - to be totally honest the experience was mediocre. The food was ok but nothing to write home about, as was the service. There was nothing wrong, it just wasn't as interesting as I had expected given the reviews.

The second time we went to the Melody Bar, we actually came to hear the live music as we were thinking of hiring the band for an event we were hosting. The bar was great, the place was just the right amount of busy - not too busy that you felt like a sardine but busy enough to have a good vibe. The band was fantastic (Parkside Drive) they had a great stage presence and really worked the room. We had drinks and a snack. We ordered the poutine. When it arrives I was surprised that instead of french fries it was perogies. I obviously didn't read the menu closely before ordering, it was a delish surprise. The cocktails were also quite good the caesar was nice and spicy just the way I like it. The server was attentive and kept checking back to make sure we had everything we needed.

The only down side was the pair of rather large pillars that obstructed the 'stage' area. But other then that a great place. So verdict - I would return to the Melody Bar, not so sure about the Café."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant for a concert with a large group of friends.

The food was fine, the drinks were fine, and the prices were fine.

The incident that really ruined it for me was that they refused to allow us to add chairs to our table. Two of us ended up sitting separately at the bar. The bartender was really great though, so I was somewhat satisfied, but the server who didn't let us add chairs to the table should have offered us some explanation and an alternative seating option."}
{"text":"The cafe room in the hotel is a great space with high ceilings and is typically never oppressively busy. It's a great place for sunday brunch- laid back atmosphere and the food is good. The fact that you don't have to line up is great along with all the sunday papers they have incuding the New York Times.
Better than a lot of other establishments along Queen West IMHO."}
{"text":"Went to the Gladstone for the first time for brunch this past weekend. I had heard good things about the place and have been there for dinner and many other event but just not brunch. 

Overall, the food was pretty tasty - I had the eggs benny (as usual) but for some reason the Melody Bar was packed and it slowed down the kitchen dramatically. It took them an hour to get us our food, and I was starving. 

The servers were really friendly but that still didn't make up for the incredibly slow service. Not sure if I will try it again as there are many others places in the area to try. 

Prices were generally average and lattes were good."}
{"text":"The staff are caring, lovely people who have made this last year and a half of my work at Akimbo Art Promotions a better place. I truly enjoyed being a 2nd floor studio renter and appreciate that the hotel has an arts and culture mandate *heart*"}
{"text":"The Gladstone certainly promotes a diverse scene, attracting everyone from cringe-worthy karaoke kooks to convening curators, depending on the day and the venue within the Gladstone itself. That may account for the rather mixed reviews here: if you're coming here for a night out, make sure you're going with (and to) the right crowd.

The Gladstone's café is intimate and quite classy-looking, but the Melody bar has more of a rockabilly-meets-the-jazz-age feel to the decor. The musical acts tend to be a bit loud, and people have complained about the music drowning out dinner.

They have monthly cocktail specials on a unified theme. Currently, it's elections/politicians, named after American and Canadian politicians whose political futures have been getting decided lately. I hear next month it'll be Star Trek-themed. Bring on the Blood Wine and Romulan Ale!"}
{"text":"The Gladstone Hotel is a hotel and cafe by day and a bar and private event space by night.

I have thrown many parties with the Gladstone, in fact, I started Pink Mafia's flagship party, Sport Pig in their 250 person ballroom. The Melody bar has karaoke on the weekend and it gets pretty packed.

The story goes like this: It was a grungy hotel and halfway house that got revamped into an artist-designed boutique hotel shortly after The Drake Hotel broke the redesign cherry on West Queen West.

It's a lot more local feeling and down tempo. The bartenders who were there when it was a hole are still at the Melody bar and they host a plethora of art exhibits, community/art based events and they do Rockstar Hotel MMVAs every year as well.

It's a great stop for a drink and the rooms are cute and cheap.
Plus, they have a real cowboy who works the elevator. Cute for a quirky getaway anytime."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a long time. 
After being recommended to go here for a coffee instead of our usual haunt, Balzac's and I was bitterly disappointed. The gentleman behind the counter huffed and puffed as we ordered our Americano's, barked at me when I asked where the milk was, seemed reluctant to take my credit card, and then turned his back on my friend as she is trying to give her order. 
I don't think I shall be returning for an overpriced coffee any time soon."}
{"text":"The food was decent when we had brunch here today but the service was absolute shit.  The servers ignored me when I came in and were deliberately rude.  They were then very slow about everything, screwed up our orders, etc.  Did you know the huevos here doesn't even have avocado on it? Lame.  I felt over charged, frustrated, and disappointed with the meal when we left.  Never again."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday Brunch.

While the food was ok, the experience was great.  No better way to enjoy a quiet Sunday morning with lots of food and live music.  Highly highly recommend for family & friend get togethers!"}
{"text":"Quite a lovely place to go for a late dinner or brunch.  I frequent the place quite often because my daughter lives in the area.  I've never had a complaint about the food or service... however the music can be a bit too young for the crowd that is in there most of the time."}
{"text":"this review/ranking is about going there for a drink...warm beer, no matter how good the service warm beer can't be tolerated.

But we will add, the service was ho hum / very slow...the bar waiter was also taking table orders and delivering food...he was cool, calm and collected; but no one can give good service if they can't get to you.  

Anyway, finally got our beers.  They were flat and warm, (not the bar tenders fault).  Due to beer quality didn't stay for a second or food.  Went to pay - no one could take our money.  There was a guy behind the bar, (glass clearer/runner? who knows),  but he wasn't allowed to take our money; had to wait for the other guy to come back from whereever he was...we couldn't leave cash so had to wait.....

Funnily enough server was very friendly when we told him the beer was warm.  His response was \"oh yeah, we've had that complaint before..it's the distance the beer has to travel up the lines from the cellar\".  

Well, guess what, this ranking is not for the slow service, it's not his fault he's the only one serving...it's for the establishment which can't get the beer temperature right, (even though they clearly know there's a problem), or the number of staff right.

Sorry Gladstone, we wanted to like you, you look nice."}
{"text":"Was heading out of Toronto and my son and I  stopped for supper.  I had ordered a hamburger and was told that they cook  it medium rare to medium which was ok by me.  When it arrived, it was well done and somewhat dry. I opted for salad instead of fries.  Salad seem to have little or no dressing.  My son's meal was much better.

For a $15.00 burger...extremely disappointed.  Gave a 2 star rating based on my son better dining experience.  Not likely to go back again."}
{"text":"Mmm, brunch at the Gladstone cafe!  The food is tasty and the place isn't crowded (on Saturday, anyway--Sundays might be a different story), so it's a nice, relaxed place to start your weekend.  Try the organic hot chocolate sweetened with maple syrup--so yummy!"}
{"text":"Just close the f'ng door! It's winter and if that skinny jeaned duffus let's the draft in one more time. Put a barrier between the guest entrance and lounge. It's clear though that they stopped giving a crap about this place a while ago so am sure they won't. Food - awful. We got a cheese plate and felt embarrassed for the poor server (who was very nice) who brought it out"}
{"text":"I don't go to the Gladdy for karaoke, or Friday or Saturday night fun. Instead I host some work events there, or go after work for drinks and dinner. I adore this place. aDORE!

The Gladstone Café is one of my fave places to eat in the whole city. I love the décor, love the staff, always feel well taken care of and happy. The main ballroom is great for our corporate events, and equally great for other fun shows like the Burlesque comedy show I checked out a few months ago. The other side, where karaoke is held, is a little more divey, but the menu is still superb, with an awesome staff. Neither myself nor my friends have ever eaten anything here that wasn't completely delicious. AND they serve a ploughman's meal like I remember from the Old Country, complete with Branston pickle!

Ooh, I love the washrooms too.

Some friends of mine from out of town recently took my advice and stayed in two of the artist-designed rooms, and had a blast. I checked out one of their rooms and it was beautiful. There's such a retro kitsch feel to this place, that you can't help but feel good. Plus the manual operated elevator is super fun.

Sure it gets full of hipsters on the weekend, but what place doesn't? Sometimes it's good to just enjoy a place because it's good and use the hipsters as fun eye-candy and conversation pieces.

And the piece de resistance? My favorite grilled cheese in the city. A few types of cheese, hot, but not soggy apples, and raisin-walnut bread. Can I has now? Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Redrum!  Red Room! 

Don't worry Mrs. Torrance, there are no malicious spirits in this hotel

The guy and I were in Toronto for a concert, when we decided to stay here. When we checked in a Johnny Cash tribute band was playing which seemed to set the perfect tone for this really neat hotel. At a quick glance you know that this place is old, but that just adds to the charm. As you walk around the hotel, you'll discover that the hotel is full of art! This isn't just a place to sleep, grab a drink, or to see a show, the Gladstone Hotel is also an art gallery. 

We stayed in the Red Room, and the description is 100% accurate, everything in this room is red. Don't worry though, it wasn't so red as to cause any psychotic breaks or fits of rage; the bright red was actually very warm and welcoming, as was the queen sized bed. The only downside to the whole experience was that the shower was very small, which anyone wanting to shave their legs would find challenging. (If you do plan on staying here, and if you think you want to shave your legs, practice standing on one leg, and work on your flexibility).  Staying here was the highlight to the weekend, and I can't wait to come back, and to see more of this unique hotel."}
{"text":"The Gladstone is so big that it's possible to go there a number of different times and not repeat an event or room in which it is held.  While I have never stayed in the famed \"artists quarters\" hotel part of the Gladstone, I have been to plenty of events which have included: bands, comedy shows, festival openings, dance parties, karaoke, art shows, clothing sales and many more than I can think of right now.

Overall though, that diversity of choice means that the Gladstone isn't necessarily my first choice of places to go on a generic weekend night, because every weekend is something different.  Obviously there are going to be times when nothing going on there strikes one's fancy, and that's fine, too.

I like that the Gladstone is so mutable without losing its arty vibe.  I also like that it really is down to earth in comparison to the trendy hipsterati that clown around places like the Drake just a short hop away."}
{"text":"just finished brunch at the melody bar; was excited to eat brunch in there as we have never sat on that side for food. we were seated fairly quickly and then a few minutes later, we were approached by our sever, dan, who dropped off menus. next time around, we were curtly asked if we wanted anything to drink--when i asked what a women at the next table was having, dan had a hard time deciphering whether i meant her food or the obvious glass of juice and sneered the answer \"juice\". the person i had brunch with does not eat dairy and asked for some olive oil for her toast to which dan replied, \"i will see, not sure if we have olive oil during brunch.\" really? are you kidding me? our meals came--and it turns out they do. so, the mystery is solved--you can in fact get olive oil out of the kitchen for any meal. i ordered the eggs bennie and i have to say i have never had a meal where the eggs were actually larger than the starch it sits on...which could be great, except they were very small eggs. when my friend asked for jam, two disposable containers of kraft jam were left on our table. we both found it very strange that a hotel that would pride itself in locally sourced ingredients would use that crap as a jam, especially with the grow up festival happening in the hotel. there was no food check and our utensils were delivered after our food by another server, who seemed to understand we needed those things to eat. 

i work in the industry as a bartender--and have for a long time. the service we received from dan was the worst i've had in this city for a long time. 

i thought the days of indignant service on queen west was dead, but seems to be alive and well with dan at the gladstone melody bar. i live in the neighbourhood and keep trying to like the food services at the gladstone, but today killed it. never again. i understand busy, but busy is not an excuse for dealing out negative experience.

on a positive note the grapefruit juice was good."}
{"text":"Great coffee and breakfast. Can be crowded in the morning, but for a late lunch, you should be fine to find a seat."}
{"text":"I ate at the hotel awaiting a workshop that was hosted there. I ordered a side of Caesar salad (it was vegan) and their pasta. The portion sizes were quite small but surprisingly enough to fill you. The pasta was stuffed with cheese and was cooked a little over for my liking but the presentation of both dishes was impressive. 
The pasta was hot and the vegan Caesar was surprisingly tasty. There were two large chunks of toasted soy with a unique and flavourful dressing over mixed greens. 
I loved the look of the restaurant as well as the hotel, it is hip, fun and unique. The wait staff was attentive and polite, it felt as though you were being served by your friends at their own place."}
{"text":"Went here after going to the Sky Yard at the Drake hotel (see their review too) and being treated like scum. Had the most delicious portobello burger at the most reasonable price. My friend even got both FRIES and SALAD as a side. Wicked service too!!!

Definitely coming back again sometime."}
{"text":"***This is a review for DINNER at the Gladstone Hotel***

I purchased a LivingSocial voucher to try the restaurant at Gladstone Hotel.  My boyfriend lives in the area and we have been wanting to try it anyway so we figured why not!  We are grateful that we tried it w/ a discounted deal because this place is not worth even a penny of your money!  (Sadly, it wasn't even worth the money I paid for the deal) First of all, our appetizers took about an hour and a half to come out.  Tables around us that ordered AFTER us, received and finished their apps before we got ours.  We asked the waiter twice about these apps.  Then, the entrees came out, before our salads came out.  There must have been confusion in the kitchen and our entrees (striploin steaks) were COLD and had no flavour except for the butter it was fried in.  The slices beneath the top were lukewarm, at best.  Our salads were then brought out to us.  The table next to us who sat down after us and received their apps first, did not get their entrees until after we were done our entire meal.  So it wasn't just our order that took forever.  This dinner took just over 2.5 hours! Unbelievable.  Also, when we finished our first round of drinks, the waiter didn't come back to check on us or ask if we wanted another drink - so after 40 minutes of sitting there, we got up and ordered drinks at the bar.  I will not give this place another chance.  Taking that long to serve a meal is unacceptable especially when the restaurant isn't even full, but cold food is unforgiveable under any circumstance.  Save your money and go elsewhere as there are far better restaurants in the area deserving of your money."}
{"text":"The melody bar is super fun on the weekend with the live music and karaoke. The menu is good but they were out of a lot of items and the food was not that great (the salad with my burger was only lettuce and radish). Also didn't appreciate that they made us settle up and order from the bar later in the night even though we had been there for dinner."}
{"text":"I love the Gladstone hotel and very happy that this institution exists in our community. I have never stayed at the hotel itself but I have been to numerous events hosted by the hotel. They have a nice rooms on the lower level which have music, dance, film, art, exhibits and other fun events that support artists and local talent.

However, sadly I am not a fan of their food. I went there with a friend and we ordered from their brunch menu. I got french toast which came with sausage and as soon as my nicely arranged plate arrived, I said to myself 'oh boy, this place is more about decoration' - unfortunately that was true. For that price, I expected something better.

Sorry Gladstone, I'll support your events but I can't do your brunch.."}
{"text":"\"Go easy on the Gladstone Melody Bar,\" my conscience tells me. \"Sure, they had no record of your reservation for a booth for six, but they did manage to squeeze you into a cruddy table for four - only TWO of your friends had to stand at any one time. Sure, they took over an hour between giving you the cheque, honouring their FourSquare discount and letting you get the heck out of there, but it was a busy night. Sure, there was that one time that you had the scrambled tofu brunch plate, but that... that was actually a good time.\"

The Melody Bar is a beautiful space, and most of the times that I've been there, it's been for the monthly Simpsons Trivia, which has become such a zoo that you really can't expect decent dinner service. It's still a good time though, but that's despite the Melody Bar staff, not at all because of them. Yes, it's a busy night, but the quality of a restaurant's staff is tested during busy nights, and they've disappointed too many times - it's not like they weren't expecting the rush. Having no record of my reservation, that makes me feel like a chump, a feeling I can do without.

The food itself is decent, but not exactly up to par with the price you pay for it. I go for the portabella burger, which comes filled with hot cheese that burns your face when they're in too much of a rush to tell you that it's filled with hot cheese that burns your face (twice). The poutine is more expensive and less delicious than Poutini's, just a short skip away.

My one good time here was a weekend brunch, when I got some scrambled tofu plate, I don't know, I don't even remember, I'm so upset about the other times. See how that works, Melody Bar?

Oh, I also went once during a Saturday karaoke night, but the place was so incredibly packed, I can't imagine putting my name on the list to get a song in. I've already got my karaoke places, thank you very much.

So, I don't know, conscience. Go easy on the Gladstone Melody Bar? I want to, man. I do. For you. But I gotta tell it like it is. That's me, through and through, to the bitter end, muchacho."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in tonight to attend a chocolate tasting event. We were disappointed as the event was supposed to take place at another location a few days before and was unexpectedly cancelled, but in the end we were happy to have had the opportunity to attend at the Gladstone instead. What a neat place! I'd love to stay in one of the unique rooms some day and sample their food."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch spot! The atmosphere is lovely and the menu is tasty. Especially those breakfast potatoes- lightly seasoned with rosemary and thyme."}
{"text":"Love the brunch at Melody Bar. Karaoke is a blast but they never called us so probably best to go right at 9."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Gladstone three stars, but the incessant noise just drove me nuts!  

To be fair, a lot of this is beyond the hotel's control as it's located in a busy area.  There is construction right across the way and the crew starts at 7 AM with the crane!  I got moved to another room, but here too I was disturbed early in the morning by the supermarket across the way.  A guy with some kind of turbo-charged cleaner seemed to be cleaning leaves off the ground.  I think Gladstone could speak to the businesses in the area and try to get them to refrain from this activity so early in the morning.  

By the time I got to my third room, I was subjected to a motor or fan on the roof which would go off and on in the early morning.  I am on vacation and the last thing I want is to have my sleep disrupted from 7-9 in the morning.  The concierge told me that others had already complained about it.  So, why hasn't someone done anything about it?  

Then, trying to catch a break, I was subjected to OPERA singing in the hallway no less!  It seems Gladstone wants to rake in some more money, so they are turning the space into an arts venue.  I mean, I'm fine with the art gallery idea but OPERA?  You can't have it both ways Gladstone: are you a hotel or an Opera Hall?

Outside of that, which was a big disadvantage, my experience was pretty positive.  The place has a very charming feel and obliging staff which did a number of favors for me.  You are a stone's throw away from the largest Tibetan community in North America which is a definite plus from a cultural perspective, though be prepared to get on the street car if you wish to get anywhere.  For me that wasn't a problem since I love streetcars, but others may not want to spend that kind of time traipsing around.

The rooms are intriguing, though a bit cramped.  Conditions tend to be tidy, but in my first room right across the street from construction the window behind the curtain was filthy and there was bird shit all over."}

I was recently invited to Gladstone Hotel Cafe to check out Chef Mario Paz's new Spring menu and I gladly accepted since I am always interested in checking out boutique hotels around the city.
For me, there is always something special about boutique hotels, their attention to detail and the fact that you can soak in the history of the city just within that building- it's like a museum on it's own.

Honestly, I am always unsure what to think of restaurants within hotels- especially boutique ones. They are almost always 'globally inspired' which means they pretty much have everything dish on the menu. Which often means it's always half-ass'd (excuse my language) that leaves me all confused as what to order. However, tasting at Gladstone Hotel Cafe changed my mind and here is what I got to try.

Blackberry Gin & Tonic

Mushroom Salad Roll- Grilled king mushrooms with crispy vermicelli, spring noodles and truffled hoisin sauce

House Chorizo- Avocado salsa on crispy polenta, this hearty appetizer was a nice way to start the meal.

Blue Crab Salad- Fennel roasted tomatoes, coconut lime dressing on charred romaine heart. Nice and light salad that is perfect for hot summer day.

Saucy Rib Nibblers- Ontario lamb ribs, sweet hoisin BBQ sauce and celeriac slaw. I think I need to get myself some more lamb ribs because these were so tender and the meat literally fell off the bone. One of my favorite dishes from the night.

The Jerk- Spicy pulled jerk chicken with slaw on soft house made coco bread. This was not spicy at all so if you can take the heat, ask them to turn it up!

Texas Tempeh Burger- 48 hour matinated organic tempeh, crunchy onion rings, wild mushrooms and bbq sauce. If you know me, I love my meat and this was my first time trying tempeh.. I was skeptical but I loved it. Earthy mushrooms and the crispy onion ring added that extra texture to the burger and I have to say that this was my favorite dish out of all.

Pad See Ew- Thai noodles with wilted mustard greens, savoy cabbage with peanut candied bird chili. I wasn't expecting much from this dish but it was delicious! It wasn't too heavy and seasoned just right. The bird chili on top? I would say be aware if you can't take the heat.

Vindaloo Pork- Pork tenderloin, brown butter confit grapes and vindaloo sauce. Another solid dish out of all, pork was very tender and the sweet grapes were a nice touch.

Mexican Chocolate Fudge Brownie with salted caramel sauce (Vegan). I guess the fact that this was vegan made it a tad dry? I've never tried vegan fudge brownies before so I can't really compare.

Summary: Gladstone Hotel Cafe serves globally inspired dishes and does a solid job. Make sure to check out the hotel and drop by for their Texas Tempeh Burger!"}
{"text":"Concept hotel - awesome idea. Staff is fantastic. Food is great! I was put into a room that had Victorian style decor - definitely not my style - and a little creepy. But, whatever. The rest of the rooms look great online. The bed was unbelievable - very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"While it's not a set venue, the Gladstone Ballroom is a gorgeous space that's often used for private events including gigs for bands that book their own shows.  Art openings, weddings and industry events are also commonplace here, and if it seems too frilly for your tastes, you can always slip next door to the Gladstone's bar and engage in some good ol' karaoke Thursday through Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The Gladstone is my second-favorite place to stay in Toronto (after the posh Le Germain downtown, though one can't always spring for the best!).  The rooms are individually themed with amazingly artful decor, and the staff is super-nice and helpful.  The bar & cafe on the main level are lovely; both great places to visit even if you live in the city.  I highly recommend the apple flapjacks, which are available during brunch on the weekends.  They serve great coffee, too.

The surrounding neighborhood of West Queen West is up-and-coming, with tons of interesting shops & restaurants.  This is a great place to stay if you're young and looking to have fun in one of the most interesting parts of Toronto."}
{"text":"I came by for brunch and ordered a typical greasy breakfast that came with eggs, peameal bacon and some gluten free bread.

The breakfast was alright but I had never tried gluten free bread and I don't think I'll be trying it again anytime soon!  That thing is heavy!!!  

Everything came as expected and filled me up good.  I tried my brothers huevos rancheros and it was ok.  Definitely not one of the worse ones I've tried in Canada but far from an excellent one.

The Gladstone itself is pretty bad ass though.  I love the way it looks and hope to come back for an event or show in the near future."}
{"text":"This is a review of the food and drinks at the café & restaurant, but not the actual hotel.

I like the food at Gladstone but I find it a bit too expensive for what is actually on the plate.  If you're charging upwards of $10 for a cocktail and have a fancy menu where the cocktails have names and detailed descriptions, then I expect it to come garnished to the nines and looking like it's ready to put out on a first date. It should not look like I can make it at home with one hand tied behind my back.  Both the dishes and drinks are pretty creative with their ingredients, but there is nothing really groundbreaking in my opinion.  One of the dishes we had was a haphazardly thrown together spaghetti with channa masala, which I'm still trying to decide if that's creativity at its best or someone using up leftovers.  I think a little more effort in presentation would go a long way here.

I think what the Gladstone has going for it is the atmosphere. I've been to Gladstone as a party venue and I like it much better as that, or I can see how it's a chill place to go for a drink or meet up.  But for dinner, I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Very interesting boutique hotel, but not for everyone. Each room is a work of art, but like most works of art, they do not come with adequate bathroom or closet facilities. The staff is dedicated and friendly but sometimes it's hard to find them.The staff-run elevator is funky and fun, but waiting for it can be a bit of a drag.We stayed here because it was close to our wedding venue, and i guess I'd stay here again under similar circumstances, but I wouldn't go out of my way. TIP: If you will be sharing a bed with someone, make sure you find out how big the bed is in your room before you book."}
{"text":"Hipster hotel! Art everywhere which is really neat. Each room has a unique design theme which adds to the charm of the place. The area is not the greatest as it's on the outskirts of town but there are a few hipster bars close by. 

If I were in a single traveler or in a couple, this place would be perfectly fine as we could share the queen size bed just fine. I traveled with a platonic friend who said he'd take the floor, but when we entered the room we realized alas, there was no floor space to be had. We awkwardly lined the middle of the bed with pillows to solve our problem but just a heads up for future travelers, the rooms are tiny!"}
{"text":"After staying at the Drake and loving it, I decided to stay here to change it up and because I am more of a \"hipster\" that a yuppie. However it was the worst hotel for the money I have ever stayed at. 

#1 The toiletries SUCK! A bar of soap, really? NO shampoo! And the stall was so small that at 5'1 and 100 lbs I could barely fit, much less shave.

#2 Moths in my room. No idea how they got there. 

#3 Wine in the room tasted like a dog's foot. Or what I imagine it to taste like.

#4 The man  who was working the overnight shift on the 4th rolled his eyes at me as I brought a guy home. It happen to be a guy I have been friends with for 12 years, but that is besides the point. It's 2011 and I don't think it's appropriate to act like that towards guests. 

I come to Toronto often and usually stay at the Drake but I decided to change it up. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was average and the place was empty for a Friday night.  Burger was dry and not exciting.  I think the novelty of this place has worn off.  The spacing of the tables is also strange, made me feel like I was in a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Coffee & drinks

Can't say there is anything special in terms of food, or service. But the ambience is great. 

Been here a few times, has a special place in my heart :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful eclectic down to earth and reasonably priced hotel. On the trolley line. Good food in the cafe and music in the Melody room. Excellent service from the staff members. Fun art on each floor. Each room designed by a different artist."}
{"text":"See the movie, \"Last Call at the Gladstone\" for the history of this hotel. Artists and open-minded folks renovated. Though sad to see the way people lived in here before the reno's, it has become a centre of interesting culture. The rooms are amazingly interesting and are a good value. 
Every night of the week, there are people in the bars, and in the ballroom."}
{"text":"The Gladstone isn't somewhere you go to stay, it's somewhere you go to be.

I'm almost surprised that the Gladstone calls itself a hotel. In terms of accommodation, it is not very impressive. In terms of an experience, it manages to break through. Granted, the execution is uneven, but even qualified success in providing something interesting and unique is hard to find these days.

Starting with the basics. I was prepared for our room being small, but was surprised by just how small it was -- basically a bed with a couple of feet on three ends to navigate around it. I was also expecting that the shower would be small, but I'm not a big guy so I imagined this would be manageable. It wasn't. If you have limbs, you will need to contort yourself into odd and uncomfortable positions to bathe properly.

I was also very concerned about noise. We selected 401, the quietest room, and didn't hear a thing -- with a the notable exception of some sort of large motor what whirred and hummed almost the entire night. It felt like we were sleeping near the engine of a cruise ship. Not a roar, just a pleasant rumbling. This actually felt peaceful to us, but I'm sure others would feel differently.

The room was clean, but my allergies were overactive. I assume that the art in the room, with all its nooks and intricacy, also gathers a lot of dust. The in-room installation was far less impressive in person as well. The contrast between the rooms, vividly highlighted on the website, is far more interesting than what you actually experience.

Of course the Gladstone intends to beckon you out of your room, and that is where it really becomes quite lovely. The lounge areas on each floor are massive and serve as art galleries. I am incredibly jaded when it comes to claims of artistry, but the exhibits were truly impressive. So was the beautiful old staircase and the ancient elevator it surrounds. (It almost, but not quite, made up for the fact that the elevator requires an operator.)

The cafe downstairs was peaceful and welcoming during the day. At night (at least over the weekend) it felt too crowded for us, but we're certainly in the minority in thinking so.

The neighborhood surrounding the Gladstone is just magnificent. It rivals East Williamsburg (Brooklyn) or Fitzroy (Melbourne) in having a magnificent array of restaurants, bars, and shops. Wandering the streets kept us delighted for hours, and every meal we had was fantastic. The only other hotel we came across in this neighborhood was the Drake, which was too pretentious to take seriously.

In terms of lodging, the Gladstone almost merits a 'meh' rating. Unless you're on a cruise ship, the proportions just feel entirely wrong. That said, I've never encountered a hotel that was so enjoyable otherwise -- quite beyond what I'm able to express or even identify. That aspect is so rare, and so much more valuable, that I'd rate the Gladstone 'yay' overall."}
{"text":"Part art gallery, part hotel, this is a one-of-a-kind place to stay. I arrived late at night and the front desk were accommodating and took me up to my room in the antique elevator (I think they said it was from 1908??) that took my breath away. I know, cliche, but it was beautiful! The only downside - it needs an operator, so it's not super useful for daily use.

I love the art everywhere - it made me feel so fancy. I don't get enough moments like that as a student, so it was very welcome. I stayed in the Queen Suite, which was so beautiful. Definitely Instagram-worthy! The blue and white colour scheme felt peaceful, while the wall art gave it a bit more edge. Definitely enjoyed it, even though the room was quite small.

Oh, one thing to note: there is no bath tub, only a shower. Not a big deal for me, but it's something to be aware of.

I didn't mind the small size of the room because I was by myself, and if I was feeling a little cramped they have common areas on each floor where you can sit and relax. It felt more like a community than a pure hotel that way, which I really liked!

I ate at the restaurant once and had the Pretzel Club - so tasty! The mustard is A+. The fries are cooked to perfect. And the restaurant itself is super cute. 

They also have events in the evenings, though I didn't take part in any of that myself."}
{"text":"Beautifully restored historical landmark.  Very trendy hipster hangout for brunch, lunch, dinner or just a meeting place for drinks.  Best juicy burgers on the block.  Friendly helpful staff.  Great place for just about any event including weddings."}
{"text":"This review is for the cafe at the hotel.

Overpriced, small portion but good service. I had breakfast here on a weekday. The waitress was lovely, the coffee was fine, but that was all overshadowed by the small spoonful of oatmeal I was served for $10 canadian. 

I would never recommend this place for breakfast. Better options down the Queensway in either direction. Drake Cafe to the east and Rustic Cosmo to the west."}
{"text":"Nice service not great breakfast. Fruit not good. Bread not great. Eggs ok. Beans decent."}
{"text":"Nicely renovated but lacks any personality.The food was' t anything special and the service wasn't great.Pricey for what was served and without silverware.Really needs improve ; but has a great potential."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful old hotel along queen w. It is a great spot to go to for after work drinks or events. The interior has different sections for drinks and dining as well as for staying in. Good selection of cocktails and drinks for relatively good pricing. Solid choices of beers on tap. Food menue is limited but the appetizers were quite good.(Kalamari seasoning was delicious!)"}
{"text":"Decent vibe
Didn't try the food. But I'd still rather hope over to the Drake"}
{"text":"My cousin had his wedding here this past weekend and it was marvelous! What an amazing and cool venue for a small to medium sized event ! Service was so good, the brunch was delicious (banana french toast y'all!!), and the building is super neat! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Popped into the Gladstone for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.

We sat in the bar area - nice tall ceilings made the space feel airy and calm. We ordered lattes which were delicious and very well decorated with foam and chocolate powder.

For lunch we both had the heuvos Carlitos, which was 2 sunny side eggs on top of fried pupusa (filled with beans) and pork belly. The best part about the dish was the homemade tomatillo sauce and avocado aioli.

3-stars for pretty standard food - nothing to rave about. Service was decent and coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Not only was this my second time visiting The Gladstone, it was also my second stay in the Teenage Dream room! This charming hotel is located at Gladstone and Queen, and was pretty easy to get to driving-wise. Be warned - they only have a limited number of parking spots (at an extra cost of $25), so you may have to find street parking or paid parking in some of the green P lots nearby. 

The hotel is beautiful - full of charm, history, and beauty. The lobby is a great intro to the style of the hotel, and the staff are cheerful, helpful, and kind. The elevator is very cool, yes, but I do wish we were able to operate it ourselves, or that someone was on standby for those moments when you have an early check-out and a lot of luggage.

Each room is a different work of art ranging from the Biker Room to the Teenage Dream Room, and everything in between.  Each floor has a common room that is open during the day (and serves lovely coffee and tea in the morning hours!) to the public.

As I mentioned, I've stayed in this room twice, and it's very sweet. The furnishings are fun, but I think the room might need a bit of a refresh. The fixtures were a bit dusty. That being said, I loved the horse lamp, and the bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable - the sheets were so soft I never wanted to get out of them! The room is pretty small, but it's fine for a few nights. 

There's a couple of things that could have been improved - the access to plugs for phone charging, a book about the hotel and services, and the room was a little bit damp. Maybe that's to be expected in an old hotel though. The wifi can also be a bit sketchy, but they have so many different connections that is one isn't great you can switch them up.

I've visited the Tower Room suite which was amazing - I'd love to stay there one day! It's huge and would be awesome for a long term stay.

Convenient: there is a Fresh Co. grocery store directly behind the hotel, which is great for snacks!"}
{"text":"I do love this hotel's quirkiness and have stayed here twice before. Last night stayed in Room 308 and it was an orchestra of noisiness that repeatedly woke my friend and me up throughout the night: early-morning street noises, loud HVAC, and a very strong vibration under the floor. Explained all of this to desk guy in the morning and was given breakfast vouchers. Nice but the two of us are miserably unrested. Will I stay here again? Only if the price is good, the room doesn't face Queen Street, and it's not Room 308!"}
{"text":"It's time for the dreaded negative review.  Though I really don't like giving these, it's important to warn my fellow diners of what they might encounter if they were to go to brunch at the Gladstone Hotel. 

I've never been for dinner but after my brunch, I don't I will be giving it a try any time soon.  I went with a friend and we both ordered a standard plate.  Me the traditional bacon & eggs breaky and him the Gladstone take on a Mexican inspired breakfast.  

We were greeted with a smile that said \"I'm smiling because I have to, not because I'm happy\" and were given very little attention.  The meal took quite some time to arrive and when it did, boy-oh-boy were we underwhelmed.  The portions are tiny!!  My friend asked for an extra tortilla and he was charged $2 for it.   A bit excessive, no?

When we got the servers attention to bring our bill we were slapped with a $34 breakfast tab.  Two plates, one coffee and tap water, this seems a little steep.  The worst part is that we left the restaurant and promptly went to a bakery down the street to grab croissants to fill the gap.  

Leaving a restaurant hungry is always a bad sign, leaving hungry with mediocre service and a hefty tab is reason enough for me to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Melody Bar is a great night out, full of quality karaoke singers, great drinks, friendly service and a comfortable yet upscale atmosphere.
Whether you're going to belt a tune or just watch, with one person or a crowd, this place is definitely with checking out for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"15-20min wait on a Sunday. Serving times were slow because kitchen was busy but food was average for the cost.

Some interesting food options but strange Caribbean/Filipino style with the hipster vegetarian feel. 

$50 for 2 is steep for average breakfast."}
{"text":"Revised review:

The Gladstone Cafe is back!  After my negative experience a couple of years ago, I avoided this place until it (re) adopted a menu that appealed to me and it was worth the wait because  the brunch choices now include tasty offerings like house-made sausage and Eggs Benny served on fresh biscuits.

The service is friendly and attentive, the juices are freshly squeezed, the coffee is excellent and those biscuits are fluffy, crumbly, cheesy and downright addictive. I wish this place sold them to go by the dozen. 

My husband got a traditional breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, pancakes and potatoes; it was perfectly cooked to order as well. Simple, hearty and delicious. 

We will definately be coming back."}
{"text":"The reason for this one star is because of the rude unprofessional customer service I have received at the restaurant. Let's not forget this is my first time here and I couldn't even order off of their menu due to the lack of professionalism within this establishment. I note I will not be coming back here or recommend anyone to dine at this establishment. 

I had to wait 20 to be services with a menu and then another additional 5 mins for water to be brought at my table, mind you it wasn't even busy at all... my guess is it might have been that my ethnicity doesn't fit in their setting! 

If there is a manger reading this please do get back to me for I would like this issue to be resolved. 

P.s. The pictures of these two women are just serves who are racist!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to the Gladstone a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. There are already a lot of reviews regarding the Gladstone, however I noted that there is one thing that not one person has commented on, which is something that is always part of my key decision criteria when selecting a place to dine. Noise level. It is very important to me to be able to have a civilized conversation with whomever is at my table. While it is also key that the food tastes good and is reasonably priced, paramount for me is the setting. As already stated, we were there on a Saturday night, and were seated in the bar area (in the room to the west of the reception desk). In the other room to the east, was a live performance (not sure what are the names of the individual rooms). We expected that the restaurant would be quite busy given the time of day and day of the week, however when we arrived there was barely anyone there. We could literally choose any table we wanted. By the time we ordered, there was maybe a dozen other people in the room. My estimate was that there was seating for maybe 50 people. While the food and the pricing and the room's decor was adequate, what I want to comment on was the noise level in the room. Despite the fact that there was not even a dozen people in the room, it seemed to be rather noisy. I'd attribute this fact to the hardwood floors and the high ceilings and the fact that the tables are placed rather closely to one another. As a result, I found that both my girlfriend and I needed to repeat ourselves on quite a many occassions to hear what we had to say. Thus, if you are looking for an intimate dinner, this is not the place. However, if you are looking for a place that has an interesting atmosphere and don't mind having to raise your voice during discussion, then this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"In contrast to the Gladstone's claims that their karaoke is 'the best' in the city, at most it's now nothing more than a self-important kj, with very little stage presence but LOTS of rudeness putting on some songs. This is a VERY different vibe from the days when Peter Styles presided over the stage with his flash, black tie-ish attire and his famous applause sign that he would hold high behind a singer's back to pump up the crowd. Why they got rid of him is a question that defies comprehension, but I will say that they're right in calling this latest incarnation \"shameless karaoke\", as one would need to have some semblance of shame to continue on with this pale copy of the glory that once was karaoke at The Gladstone."}
{"text":"I feel like I can't properly review this place as I've always been just to the left of sober every time I've been here. That said, I've always had a great time. Bar service can be a bit slow when it's packed, but that's the case everywhere. Karaoke night is particularly fun, but it's tough to get onstage unless you get there early, as it's incredibly popular."}
{"text":"NOTE: My review is based on the Gladstone as a venue and restaurant than as an actual hotel. Eventually I might do that but for now, no cigar. 

Over the years I have been here to see a few shows. Drink a few drinks, watch many women take their clothes off... It was Burlesque! People get your mind out of the gutter. This is a PG-13 review. 

Also for Contact and just checking the general art they have on their floors. All in all, really good experiences.

So, the Gladstone realized they can live off just being a hotel, so they went the \"we are a completely entertainment venue approach\" and I would say they have done well. 

With floors full of art, one lounge, one restaurant, one semi-large room for shows, a tiny hidden room for private parties and galleries and an overall cool attitude, I think they are doing well. 

Prices are a bit on the higher end of average, which of course I they are doing to keep a little of that \"we are too-cool for school cache,\" that hipsters love and that every one else tries to justify with the exposed brick and retro decour and live music.

All in all I would say that it is definitely worth the visit if there are some shows you would like to check out. Not completely feeling it as far as a place to just drop by to hang out or as a watering hole. 

Maybe for me is the distance? Or the fact that at the end of all of things, aside from the actual size of the place you can find the same elsewhere? Not sure, but I would suggest you make your own choice and check it out. :)"}
{"text":"Great room, and great options- you can go to the bar right next to it that usually has events and a nicer bar area.

I'm a fan, but I'm under the impression that people who liked the \"old days\" will hate this place.  It isn't as gritty as promised and is kind of a faux-hipster scene."}
{"text":"They really should have separate pages for their hotel and their bar/lounge (Melody). This review is strictly for the bar.

The Gladstone hotel is over 130 years old, and they proudly display their heritage. It's far from run-down however, and nicely decorated with modern touches.

I came for a trivia night, and the place lends itself quite well for that being open and having a stage. Should be a good place for live music.

The menu is quite modern and very vegan and veg friendly. I'd say at nearly half of the items on the menu didn't include meat. I shared a few plates which included: the black rice bowl, 'roots and such hand cut chips', and Sriracha lettuce wraps.

The black rice bowl was the star of the show and easily one the best vegetarian dishes I've had in a while. It had very fresh tofu, black rice, sprouts and veggies in a spicy sauce. Simple in describing it, but it was a wonderful blend of flavour, served at a perfectly warm temperature and very refreshing.

The hand cut chips appetizer was pretty good as well. Very good value especially as it came with hummus and a goat cheese spread. I'd even say that was almost a perfect dish given the price since the spreads were such good quality; however the chips - though ok, and made up of a few root vegetables - were too thin and broke virtually every time you tried dip some of the cheese out. Problem solved by using a knife to spread it, but it held the dish back a little - albeit still a very good one.

The Sriracha wraps were also enjoyable. Very fresh butter lettuce and great pickled veggies and fresh jalapeño. The beef was good, though fairly simple. It's actually the freshness and vibrant taste of the veggies from that dish which stand out in memory, but the beef still did its job.

I didn't pay much attention to the drink menu since I ordered the beer on special, but I imagine it's pretty good.

I really enjoyed my meal and was pleasantly surprised at having a meal so refreshing, which wasn't typically heavy bar food. It has something for everyone and I'd fully recommend to almost anyone."}
{"text":"It is a rare pleasure to be so surrounded by beauty, history, excellent service, and art.  I'm sure many reviews will summarize how unique the vibe is here, and that alone would be enough reason to stay.  I'm going to focus on my incredibly positive experiences with the staff at the Gladstone, at which I stayed while presenting at a smaller conference for sex-positive professionals that also included evening social activities that were hosted at the Gladstone.
 
I'm often a budget traveler, not always out of necessity but rather because the nicer places tend to range from pretentious to downright snooty while nickle-and-diming every service. Furthermore, the sleek commercial art/design of those places tends to make me feel like a lonely traveler, because it is slick and pretty but not comfortable (at least, not for me). The Gladstone was a bargain at its mid-range price and I wished I could make a much longer business trip of it. Beautiful, with unique personality, wonderful people (both patrons and staff) and rooms that had real personality.   As much as I love the hostel I used to stay at in Toronto, this will be my new go-to place when I visit.
 
I have presented at many different hotels with meeting rooms all over the USA and south-eastern Canada in events from a few hundred to several thousand in size. As a professional who often speaks to groups, especially on taboo topics related to sexual well-being (even though I'm an academic-type), I frequently feel like we are the host space's secret shame and they wouldn't have taken our group if the economy weren't so tight. I have never been a part of a group that was so welcomed and tended to prior to my stay with The Gladstone. Thank you, Gladstone, for making a point of supporting independent thought and community building with all you do.
 
Nobody was not great, frankly, if you'll pardon the double-negative. I appreciate this especially because my travel buddy and I frequently needed extra assistance.  Between the two of us we covered a few special needs kinda groups: vegetarian, gluten-free, new to the trolly system, and visually dissabled. I never once got the feeling that it annoyed folks to help us. I didn't get to exchange currency to tip anyone until a day or two into our trip, but folks were just as sweet to us before I got Canadian currency after, which was also deeply appreciated. The staff were absolutely amazing every moment of our stay. It would be understandable if a host and attached restaurants left us more or less to our own devices, but that was never the case here. We were welcomed from start to finish and well attended to for our entire stay, including the many meals we ate here.  We had breakfast there every morning, a few lunches and a couple of dinners.  Most of the rest of our meals were eaten within easy walking distance at various establishments right in the area.  All were delicious and delightful!

Oh, and in response to a fellow poster who gave the Gladstone a low rating, I just wanted to note that my experience with my room and toiletries was very positive.  The boutique quality toiletries really fit the bill for me, and there was plenty of soap, shampoo, and other things in our bathroom."}
{"text":"Wow. What an unexpected surprise. I booked last minute and I am very glad I did. The service at check in was amazing and the room is unique and comfy. This will definitely be my home away from home in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came to the melody bar for the Thursday colouring and $4.00 pints. This spot is my new favourite place! Great and incredibly friendly service. Chill atmosphere, and awesome live music. Spacious, comfortable, and a cool spot for groups or for couples. Definitely coming back with my friends!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the Melody Bar.

First and foremost, you will never get a live voice if you want to make a dinner reservation, so make sure you reserve a few days in advance.  The first time I tried (last week, they returned my phone call once, I missed their call, called the back and then never heard back).  Your reservations are not confirmed until they call you back.  So don't even think about making last minute reservations because it is so not happening.

We had dinner here on a Saturday night.  The vibe is very chilled and relaxed and at 10PM the live band came on.  They were quite good.  Think Johnny Cash with a bit of Keith Urban mixed in.  It was Blues/Country music.

The service here is pretty slow.  Like, we had been sitting for 1.5 hours and we had only had our appetizer and 2 drinks.  The entrées were nowhere in sight.

The Antipasti Platter was quite interesting - eggs, pork jowl, kimchi, olives, duck liver pâté, and tuna.  

The tardy entrées finally arrived - to add insult to injury they were cold.  I ordered the Cumbrae Farms Steak Frites and the steak was what I would call a \"rough cut\" and rather bland (and cold).  The fries... well fries are fries.

My friend ordered the Korean Chicken Thighs & Short Ribs which were served with cornbread and a macaroni salad.  The chicken was quite tender and came à la chicken fingers, and the short ribs were well-seasoned (although a tad heavy on the soy = salty).  The macaroni salad was creamy but bland, and the cornbread was cold and could've been more moist.

For dessert we ordered the Moist Pistachio Cake as well as the Vegan Chocolate Cake.  Do vegans not like their chocolate?  Because the chocolate flavour in this cake was definitely taken down several notches.  And for something labelled moist, (while it was not dry), was not as moist as I expected.

The cocktails at the Melody Bar are quite good.  I had Tommy's Margarita and the Marmalade Sour.  The use of large ice cubes means your drink doesn't turn in to a watery mess.

I would probably come back to the Melody Bar for drinks and the entertainment, but not for the food or the service."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the Gladstone hasn't gotten better reviews because it's a pretty great place to stay (especially when they have room specials during the off-season). 
   I stayed one night with my BF in one of the mid-sized \"give me more\" rooms for about $170ish. It was an excellent deal considering what type of generic, chain room you would get at another hotel in this city for the same price. All the rooms have their own unique decor and you get to pick which one you want. The rooms also come with cozy beds and not your usual ammenities like organic handmade soaps and shampoos,
   I haven't been to the venue bar but went for a drink in the restaurant which had good food and a nice vibe. 
   This place really made me feel like I was on vacation when I stayed even though my apartment was a 15 minute drive away."}
{"text":"Went to the Goin' Steady party last night at the Ballroom, and the only reason this isn't rated a  is because I was told that we want to keep the awesomeness of this secret. hehe, so it's partially reviewed, but its for the good of the people. 

The 1950s and 1960s dance party was pure genius.  Some people come dressed to the theme, others are casual, but combined with the decor in the ballroom it was perfect. 

The music was anywhere from the Twist, Rock and Roll, Soul, R&B, and it all brings you back to the time where boys and girls danced innocently and just had a clean fun time.  Its also no wonder that the women of those days had such skinny waists! The twist takes a lot out of you!

I liked the bar here - they had a great choice of beers and two types of ciders. you can also get tea and coffee! They had a nice sitting area and a water corner for free tap water, genius!

I can't wait to come back here. 

Oh and if you're bored in the Ballroom, check out the Melody Bar next door!"}
{"text":"First time here. It was a Halloween night. There was a bar, a karaoke area, and a ballroom inside.

The bar area is your average bar. Sit down and grab a drink. If you are looking for more action then head to the other two rooms.

Ballroom was a having a great Halloween themed party with a live band dressed as super Mario characters. Pretty much the highlight of the night.

Keep in mind this is a review for their Halloween event."}
{"text":"A hip little hotel near the end of Queen West's main drag. Can't really say much in regards to the bar in terms of atmosphere. Their cocktails are nice and strong (always a good sign) but other than two other girls, we were the only ones patronizing the place on that particular night (granted, it was a Sunday night).

Yes, that sounds a bit lackluster but this place is worth the extended trek for the old elevator alone! Fully restored, it's the kind that requires a full-time bellhop to get it operational. Rooms here are on the pricey side ($300 or so during the off-season, more during peak) but the ambiance is cool (though maybe not worth more than a cocktail or two)."}
{"text":"This is a review for brunch at the Gladstone Hotel:

Loved the Gladstone on a night out and have been meaning to go there for brunch. I visited the Gladstone with two friends. When we arrived it was not very busy and we were seated easily. The waitress was straight over to take our drinks order. Latte was perfect, love good coffee. We ordered our food and the wait began. Around about 10 minutes after ordering our waitress came over to advise us that the kitchen was slow today and we would be about 20 minutes for out order. 

We toyed with the idea of getting something to snack on but decided not too, my friend had ordered the \"big greezey\" and was prepared for something that sounded like it was going to be an awesome feast. So we waited, and then waited. After half an hour the waitress came back to say she was sorry and was not sure what the delay was but would check, by this time I had finished my drink so ordered a tea. We waited some more, another 20 minutes passed and our waitress advised us that the manager had gone to the kitchen and then gave us a round of caesars for no charge. 

Eventually the food came out, by the time it had I had already consumed 1 latte, 1 glass of water, 1 mug of tea and half a caesar...I was a bit full. The food arrived and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. The big greezey was well...not big. I had ordered the salmon scramble and while it was nice enough it was a bit cold. I did not complain as I just wanted my food. Portion sizes are not big and I was left feeling sad, bonus though was the side order of bacon was decent but again pretty cold. 

What did not help matters...but note I KNOW this is out of the hands of the Gladstone...was the song that was playing while I ate. It was \"Goodbye Horses\" and I always associate that song with the Buffalo Bill song and him doing the mangina dance in \"Silence of the Lambs\". This is not a pretty image, and does not affect my star rating. 

Basically I give all the stars to the waitress, she was fantastic! The food wasn't even ok in my opinion. The hotel itself has a lovely feeling, where we were sitting was bright, clean and relaxed. The music (despite my comment above....but that is my issue to deal with) was excellent. 

Will I eat there again, probably not."}
{"text":"It's rather impossible to stay at the Gladstone and not compare it to the Drake. I love the Gladstone's common areas, their beautiful hand-cranked elevator (the only one still in operation in Toronto), and the wide staircases that lead up to the guest rooms. However, based on rooms alone, the Drake handily wins out.

Here's why:
- The \"European-style showers\" at the Gladstone are too tiny. There's no way you can bend over in one without touching the walls (and I'm not exactly a giant.)

- No iPod docking stations in the rooms at the Gladstone. One of the things I love most about checking into the Drake is entering my room and immediately filling it with music. My music.

- Odd bath products. I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for nearly 10 years and these offerings - little slivers of nubby soap -  were still a bit too crunchy granola. A little liquid shampoo would've gone a long way for me.

Everybody's got their something. Mine are music and showers and nice-smelling bath products. It makes me especially happy when I can have all three at the same time 

At the current exchange rate, a standard room at the Gladstone is under $150 USD. Given the hotel's unique charms, free wifi and super soft linens this is a steal."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the food at the Melody Bar at the Gladstone Hotel.  

The melody bar is a great little space and I was there on St. Patrick's Day for dinner and a show.  The service was okay and the food is somewhere between a 1 and 2 stars.  There were 3 of us who ate and we had the following: Poutine (flavorless gravy with a few cheese curds on some okay french fries) a sandwich (my brain just blanked out, cannot recall what kind, but it too was very bland and the third person had dessert (apple crisp with ice cream).  The dessert was the best of the 3, but it was nothing to write home about.  The beer was good, the show was excellent and I love the location and space.  We will go back, but we will eat prior to doing so and just drink while there."}
{"text":"The Gladstone Hotel is the oldest continuously operating hotel in Toronto. It was originally built in 1889 as a stylish hostelry across from the then existing Parkdale railroad station which serviced the Grand Trunk, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and the Canadian National Railway (CNR) companies. In addition to serving the three major railway companies at the time it provided visitors attending the Canadian National Exhibit (CNE) to have a place to stay. (wiki)

The hotel is still has pretty interesting architecture, and the furniture is stylish as ever. The rooms appeared to be good, and the bar was fairly decent. I was here at the time of an Art show, it was a pretty interesting venue for it. I understand they also have karaoke here, and other events. The bar appeared decent too, and the location was good."}
{"text":"Alright, I know The Gladstone is a Toronto landmark and a totally happening spot for all the hipsters in the city, but I totally don't get it. Every time I go here, it's just terrible drunken college kids belting out karaoke tunes with no sense of pitch or tone. The service is terrible and the bar itself is outdated and bland. 

Maybe its just me, but I think there are way better bars in West Queen West in which to get your drink on. I shant be returning here anytime soon, and my ears will certainly thank me for it."}
{"text":"Edit: the food options are even worse? So expensive for how mediocre they are. 

Great atmosphere but the food options are lacklustre. The lack of food options are a reason I decide not to go here. There's no sharing options and the options they do have are extremely expensive for how mediocre they are. If they had better food I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"This update is strictly for the restaurant inside the Gladstone Hotel, simple called Café as far as I can tell. I've eaten a few breakfasts here and I have to say I've always thoroughly enjoyed their lattes. The breakfasts I've had have all been standard, but that's because I tend to order plain meals of eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit. I've also had lunch here, a ploughman's plate and a chickpea salad, which I enjoyed.

If you are staying in or near the hotel it's definitely a nice option to have nearby!"}
{"text":"Had not been here in few years (almost three years according my first review of this place). The karaoke here is just simply awesome. You have an eclectic group of people here - the hipsters, the late-20's, guys in their 60's. Regardless, everyone comes here for the karaoke - either to watch or perform. I'm still a fan of this dive - drinks are reasonable and there's no cover.

Good for: drinks, karaoke"}
{"text":"The Gladstone.  
Le sigh.
I really dig this place, you know?  Yeah, I do.  I love the quiet charm of the Melody Bar, with all their fancy iced teas, cool upcycled lamps dangling in the windows, and the laid back staff that run it.  I love the events that go down in the cluster of rooms on the second floor (hello, Speakeasy, UP to My Room, and others).  And, of course, I do love me some karoke on a random night, complete with a packed bar, sticky tables, and pints a plenty.  Character, charm, and just plain cool.
  Oh, and to add to all of this, the eats are local, fresh, and well priced.  Yes, please."}
{"text":"This is a great Hotel.  I thought it was going to be weird and overly eclectic.  Instead I found an art filled gem!"}
{"text":"Went there today to visit the Flea Market in the back room.  Had a lovely time. The lady at the front desk was super welcoming.  Afterwards, we went to the Cafe and realized that the breakfast was served in the Melody Bar.  We were seated after a 3-4 minute wait.  Our server was very attentive and answered all our questions. The Queen West Hash was a new menu item and we were told that the smoked tofu was amazing and smoky.  So my friend ordered and that I had the \"Bennies\".  The Queen West Hash had a lot of great flavours.  But the Bennies was definitely more in quantity of food and most definitely filling.  We both enjoyed our stay and were not rushed at all.  For the quality of the food, the price was definitely worth it. I would come back!"}
{"text":"I was here for their 12 Beers of Summer and I absolutely loved it. Basically paying a set amount for your ticket, then at the door you get a cup for you to fill to taste as much beer as you can. It was filled with a younger, hip crowd which was perfect for me. There were bands in the two main rooms with stages who played the entire event and kept the atmosphere lively and upbeat.
It was very roomy considering that the event itself was sold out and there were a lot of people. They opened up the main floor and the 2nd floor for the event so it was very nice that you get to somewhat tour the place as well. I enjoyed it very much since the building is old with designs from the 1800s.
The location is great as well because there are more restaurants around the area that were great for munchies after the event."}
{"text":"Whether looking at this place as a drinking locale, a brunch spot, or a place to host special events - I'm giving this place 4 stars across the board.

One thing immediately worth pointing out regardless of the situation, they have good beer selection. 99% craft beer focused with about a dozen taps and an extensive tall can selection. 

Foodwise, brunch is reasonable and generally easy to get a table. Service was incredible last time I was there as well (personable and helpful, and working his butt off to serve many tables but doing so efficiently). The food is pretty good too for reasonable prices, although I'll admit the home fries could use some extra seasoning, as they are pretty bland. 

The venue itself has a variety of rooms including an art gallery space. My girlfriend had to organize a special event their and said they were very easy to deal with and competitively priced.

On the event scale, they do offer a variety of different types of events throughout the week, so for keeping the neighbourhood interesting, I applaud the Gladstone Hotel with this 4 star review."}
{"text":"What makes me like the Gladstone and love The Drake even more? The fact that it was The Drake who suggested I stay at the Gladstone on my most recent Toronto trip. It was love at first *lift.* Certainly, there's no denying that the elevator is small - it's circa... old world. Once on the top floor (the 4th to be exact) I quietly tip toed my way through the hardwood floor entrance, past the musings of installers hanging up a new art installation (pink yarn everywhere!) and into my cosy, dimly lit (a la lets get it on) room. 

The pink entrance walls greeted me. A shiny purple duvet beckoned me to the big bed and the in-house made bars of soaps, shampoos and moisturizers intrigued me to pack them up into my suitcase! The shower, while small, also has that rare faucet at the bottom to test the temperature, or in my case, relieve my aching tootsies. Luckily there's a pretty decent black out curtain to subdue the neon pink/red bars lighting up the night sky right outside the room I stayed in. Gladstone also provides earplugs, likely to reduce the buzzing cast off of said bars in the night.

While I didn't touch the honour bar, I did take advantage of their \"Want some Joe\" program. A door hanger sits in the middle of your bed when you arrive. Just check off how you take your coffee and when you'd like it, and a sweet host will knock on your door in the morning. How could I not love this service!

A word to those not keen on stairs - there's a lot of them and the lift is slow. But as your twirl down the stairs you'll also run into some very interesting art work, the likes of which I wish I could have lingered over longer. Next time, Gladstone, next time!"}
{"text":"Had a great stay at the Gladstone. Picked the hotel after reading about it in the New York Times and thought it would be great since I love art. It WAS the perfect stay; excellent service, one of a kind room, and a great location. The neighborhood is artsy and the cable car stop is right outside the hotel so you can easily get around. I Would love to return to see more of Toronto and the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome Music Bingo on Wednesday nights with a really funny and entertaining host (I believe his name was Kaleb). You'll definitely get a great laugh. The food isn't amazing, but that's not the point. I had the flight of wings which was very original but nothing worth dining in for on a regular night."}
{"text":"Great karaoke, not the friendliest DJ or staff."}
{"text":"This is a slightly random review as it is based solely on customer service as I was not a guest of the hotel.

Needed desperately to print out tickets to an event my BF and I were already late to arrive at (who still requires printed tickets in this day and age??).

Was not a guest of the hotel but the front desk gentleman printed my paperwork for me with no hassle and a smile. THANK YOU GLADSTONE!!

I truly appreciate the favour and will definitely be back as a guest soon!"}
{"text":"The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are clean, the staff is helpful, none of my stuff was stolen from my room while I stayed there, there is a mini bar, and the wifi was fast. The rooms are interesting, there is a variety of art to suit all tastes all over the different floors of the hotel, and there is a lot going on at the hotel (from performance art on the floors with rooms to actual bands playing downstairs).

However, if you are in town for something and aren't planning on hanging out at your hotel to party, this might not be your cup of tea. It's a bit loud, and you probably know if a hotel intended for creative types to let loose is right for you or not. For me, the small room and noise (which persisted despite the earplugs that come standard with the room) were not worth the cost as I needed more of a quiet place to come back to after a busy day in the city. It was my fault for not checking more information about the hotel, as they are pretty upfront about the noise (and I was on the third floor, it could be quieter higher up), I was just enamored with the rooms (which were smaller than I expected) and booked it on a whim. 

Again, I don't really have anything bad to say about the hotel, it just wasn't the right fit for me. If sleeping in an art gallery sounds like your thing, and you aren't a light sleeper, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Gladstone. The Melody Bar hosts wonderful free concerts in the evening, and the karaoke is a laugh riot! The food in the restaurant is incredible and seasonal. I have been to many shows in the back room - NXNE, comedy, you name it. The Gladstone offers tons of free and reasonably priced entertainment most nights, and serves an eclectic crowd. Not as trendy as the Drake, in a very good way."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Gladstone for our pre-wedding and wedding nights. From the very beginning, the management and staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. Although we live in the Toronto area, we wanted a unique experience and Gladstone truly delivered. This beautiful, historical building gave us the atmosphere were were looking for us and our guests. The cafe in the lobby was perfect for breakfast meets. We were upgraded to the Tower Suite and could not be happier with the room. It was beautifully designed and it had its own little roof-top patio, perfect for pre-wedding photos. It made for a very memorable weekend for us and our guests."}
{"text":"The hotel was very neat, a mix of deco design and art gallery space. Check-in was quick, and the hotel cafe had a European vibe to it, a nice place to hang out and kill some time. Loved the vertical 2-storey wall garden and free wi-fi. The original 1907 elevator is neat, but it requires a special operator. Tip: try not to get a 4th floor room unless you don't mind a lot of walking, as these operators were never immediately available. Also, my husband and I are convinced that the room we were given was not the same artist's design we reserved online, but it was nice nonetheless so it wasn't worth mentioning. Beds are soft, toiletries are organic. The cafe menu was a little sparse and honestly my chick pea crepes stuffed with lentils was a little bland, but good beers on tap. The hotel is a little off the beaten path in an artsy part of town, so it's a hike to get to any landmarks, although we could see the CN Tower from our room. One major thumbs down: no parking lot, so you're on your own."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE EVER! Do not stay there, do not EAT THERE! Go to any other brunch place, or even make your brunch at home. Let me start by telling you why. I live in the area and there are loads of brunch places to go to. Today I decided to take a guest to the gladstone hotel to eat brunch, first off we get to the table and no one acknowledges our existence for about 15 mins. Then the female server who we never got the name since she didn't introduce herself, dressed like a hippy, and was shuffling over to us, came over took our orders without a a note pad. We finally got the food after waiting again another 20 mins, let me tell you as well, it was empty at the restaurant at that point. They bring my guest his food and mine, mine was completely wrong as they gave me scrambled instead of over easy. Then we had to wave our waitress over, she didn't apologize for the mistake just told me to wait a minute it will be out. She couldn't care less, she didn't care at all. Then she goes & doesn't refill our water. Finally its now the second time I get my food, the eggs are completely cooked through, not runny like over easy eggs should be, and the toast the kitchen thought was appropriate to give me was a piece of toast with the biggest hole in it, there was just crust, no bread. I once again had to get up out of my seat to tell this woman to please look at what they served me. She slowly came over, didn't care and said it will be out in a minute. She did not apologize or care, didn't even say sorry as this was the second time this happened. At this point my meal isn't with me, she didn't offer me anything to hold me over, my guests brunch is completely finished and he is waiting there with me. The two tables next to me haven't been attended to, and they walked in about 10 mins ago. Now I am fed up, so i ask the waitress to speak to the manager, she says yes, and then proceeds to go up to all the tables, take her time, talk to everyone, even talk to her bar staff and THE MANAGER, but does not tell the manager we need to talk to her. Unbelievable. Then my guest had to GET Up, and go to the bar to ask for the manager himself as the waitress couldn't care less. The manager finally comes  over, I let her know the horrible service we've experienced, she was genuinely listening to us. She said she didn't want to make an excuse of the slow service but they had a wedding party that came in and wanted breakfast in a private room. I didn't have the heart to tell her but she was making excuses, the thing is when we walked in the restaurant was empty! no one was there, and because of their mistake twice it started to get busy but that is still no excuse for poor customer service. If they are open they need to provide decent service. I tell the manager, if the waitress just simply said sorry, or apologized for the mistake this would have been somewhat okay. She didn't care about us or anyone she was serving. She ignored us and the tables and I really have lost my appetite. Oh and the food still hasn't come around the 3rd time around so I'm still waiting. It is a luxury to be able to eat out for brunch, and the Gladstone staff seem entitled and didn't care. I recommend this spot to all my guests and now after this experience I will never step a foot in there. We could have gone to the drake hotel and ate there and then paid and came back and we still wouldn't have had our food at the Gladstone. The manager gave me her card and two coupons for a free breakfast, she comped our breakfast, but honestly I lost my appetite, I was so angry, and frustrated, and the food came and now my guest has to sit and watch me eat. So awful. Anyways, I felt bad for the other guests as no one else was complaining. so I told the manager she should probably see what the two tables next to me needs as they haven't been served and its almost 20 mins they have been sitting down. She helps them and gives them a free coffee, but only because I know I said I would write a review. The gladstone needs to reassess their staff, as I will never be eating there again, I will pay 4x the price if I have to so I never have to eat there again. I will do everything in my power to tell everyone about this experience, as this is a big reflection of how the kitchen and the cafe run their staff. At the end of the day the waitress is a representation of the Gladstone brand, even if it wasn't her fault and was the kitchens fault she would need to apologize for the delay and the mix ups which happened twice. She never did and that right there is poor customer service in a industry where customer service is king, so therefore that means the Gladstone does not care for their guests. Please be wary of this place, especially if you simply want to be treated like a decent guest, not even spectacular, just simple treated with dignity. As for the taste of the food, i tried my guests home fries they were extremely salty, and their bacon was the kind you'd buy at costco. Enough said"}
{"text":"I've never stayed any place like the Gladstone before! Each room is designed by a different local artist and/or architect.

I stayed in the \"offset\" room where the concept was a \"room within a room\". You need to see it to truly experience it.

Overall the stay was good. Service was great - especially the prompt elevator attendant. Room was quiet (4th floor, NOT on Queen). Bathroom was TINY. In room snacks were surprisingly reasonably priced, and tasty! 

Staying at this hotel made me want to move to Toronto and live in the hip West Queen West neighborhood. It also made me curious about \"adult coloring\", one of their many weekly events.

{"text":"Its a pitty that ive passed by this place numerous of times but have never gone in. Glsd i made that choice this past weekend.  Queen street west of Drake Hotel, Gladstone is more of a chilled out environment where you can sit back and catch up with friends over drinks and if you're lucky, on Saturdays they've got live music.  My buddy and I were fortunate to watch Arlene Paculan band play in a chilled out and pretentious - free ambiance.  We didn't stay for food but rather just drinks....2 vodka sodas for $13 ain't bad.  Ill be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Need to come here a few more times. But this place looks really nice. The old elevator is a really nice attraction and the art is great to see all around.

Went to the free beer night! Now what great place gives away free tasters of beer event? And we're not talking Coors Light or Labatt 50 (though they did have that), we're talking craft beer from all around Canada.

And the people who worked there were so witty, charismatic and cool!

Christmas Music Activate!"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch last weekend, as our usual brunch spot was still closed while we were already hungry on a Sunday morning. We had the huevos rancheros and French toast, and I added some jasmine tea. That turned out to be a delightful meal.

The thing I like is that the menu items look like any menu item from a stereotypical greasy diner. Except that the food in reality is way way far off that. Way better, in fact. 

The tea, oh, the tea. I fell in love with the tea. It's not your generic tea in a bag that comes in individual sachets. It's tea in a translucent bag that is tied around a wooden stick and hanging on top of your mug. Talk about awesome presentation.

The meals were quite amazing too. I was glad that there was the choice to be traditional and get it with fries (or was it potatoes?), or hippie/healthy/[insert adjective here] and get it with a house salad, which was what I did. It looked quite fresh. And yes, fruit comes with the platter as well. 

Overall, it is a nice subdued place to have brunch. It's a little on the pricey side, but I think it was well worth every dollar."}
{"text":"I love that the melody bar hosts drag shows on Mondays and shows Rupaul's Drag Race on their TVs. The crowd is awesome and polite and the food was delicious. I ordered the cauliflower burger because my waiter suggested it and it was absolutely amazing! Service is hit and miss here though and I find that the drinks are not made consistent. One week's Caesar was insanely spicy and then the next was bland. Clean bathrooms and a cool spot to chill... My favorite combo for a night out with the girls. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Melody bar.  It's ok..a decent night out.  The bar looks a little dated...and when we went there was an overall much older crowd. ..nothing wrong with that..but not the vibe we wanted that night
  Live bands play there so it's a nice change from a DJ playing  a Mac.  Good for stopping by for a drink and a song or two...but not for the whole night."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this for the ballroom.  I attended a concert there, Uma Nota.  The people at the door were professional, and the bartender was patient in explaining to me that there is a $50 minimum for credit card transactions at the bar.  Not a big fan of that, but at least she took the time to explain, including that you cannot close the tab from 1am-2am.  What?!

Also, it was HOT in the ballroom.  Don't get me wrong, I like a sweaty place to dance as much as the next dude, but this was ungodly HOT.  I'd go back, but would 1. bring cash, 2. wear less clothes."}
{"text":"ive been to all parts of the gladstone except for staying in rooms.  though i have been in the rooms when there were craft shows there.  and ive seen bands in the ballroom, karaoke in the melody bar and talked with the bartenders.  

theres no pretention here, theres history, theres the culture of visual, performance and musical art in the city.  and theres patrons who perhaps cant sing doing karaoke.  thats what karaokes for.  for those people.

and theyve stepped up to the plate in their own way...reinventing themselves many times over.  143 years is along time."}
{"text":"I visited the Melody Bar for cocktails and live music last Friday. I was pleasantly surprised to see the bar was half empty when I arrived shortly before 9pm. No cover and I could take in the whole place before finding a great table with a view of everything!

Live music was courtesy of Big Rude Jake and The Killer-3. This guy plays swing, jazz, blues, and used to perform at The Reservoir Lounge. Imagine my delight to see he was playing the Melody Bar! It's loud, it's dirty, it's earthy jazz. 

At around 11pm, the place converts into a karaoke bar! It is before 11pm that the place starts to fill up because the people want their karaoke. There are regulars, people celebrating birthdays, young people and even someone in my group who got up and sang. It was so much fun. 

A delightful and fun night was had by all!"}
{"text":"... really dig the Gladstone. From the super friendly staff to the old-timey elevator, the rotating art installations, the old school architecture and the unique room décor, this spot is charming, artsy, and certainly not your run-of-the-mill Marriott type set-up.

(So, for those looking for spacey/plush accommodation, a really nice hotel gym, room service, etc., know this isn't the place for you.)

That's no dig on the Gladstone; this place is what it is and it's great... it just certainly falls outside the \"hotel norm.\" 

Free coffee and tea each morning, and the charm? It's definitely part of the package."}
{"text":"We were searching for a place for brunch, and came upon the Gladstone.  After a brief wait, we were seated.  The waiter dropped menus off and walked away.  He came back and dropped water onto the table - and walked away.  He came back to find out if anyone wanted coffee - and dropped off the order without any cream.  We waited - and eventually one of the party got up and asked at the bar for cream, which was quickly provided.  He came back for our breakfast order.  His style was very succinct.  This succinctness went on.  I suspect he was busy and focused - but he came off as unfriendly.  A little more communication and a smile would have gone a long way to making us feel like we were actually an acknowledged entity in his work life at that moment.

After a very long wait - 30 minutes from ordering - our breakfast showed up.  Maybe this is normal for this place, however, for bacon and egg type breakfasts, it seems excessive - and we had no contact from the waiter about the timelines. Simply stopping by to check if we wanted coffee refills and let us know the kitchen is behind, or has to harvest the eggs from the hens (i.e. - set an expectation) would have made a big difference.

Once we got our food, it was delicious - we really enjoyed it.  If this review was based solely on food and décor, it would be a 4*.  But our experience was impacted by the succinct waiter.

We got our bill in a timely manner - and after we were all settled, he inquired if we wanted refills on the coffees!  Too little too late bud.

Would I recommend:  We loved our breakfast, and I think our experience was greatly impacted by the server - so yes, I'd send people here.
Would I return: yes, but I'd work to ensure I had a different waiter.  :)"}
{"text":"What a place! My girlfriend and I just visited Toronto for an action packed extended weekend. Naturally I kept my mouth shut on the topic of hotels. I agreed to follow orders and stay where ever she decided. After researching the area, she finally chose the Gladstone, which turned out to be a great choice. 

We arrived at noon but our check in time wasn't until 3 pm. No matter, Ricardo (the super friendly, extremely helpful, hip to be cool receptionist) came to the rescue. Ricardo was not only able to check us into a new room, he also gave us an upgrade. He explained to us the area, gave us maps, advised us on parking and gave us a detailed rundown of the hotels history. Within the first ten minutes of arriving I new my GF had made the right decision. Here is a rundown of the hotel.

Staff was excellent, knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms are each a distinct design from local artists so no two rooms are the same. The hotel is equipped with a bar, cafe and restaurant and is located in a great part of town. 

The Gladstone is a home run when it comes to hotels. I am certainly not an expert on extravagant hotels, but I can confidently say that this place was the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at."}
{"text":"3.5/5
There's always something happening here. I've come for readings, art shows, parties - pretty much name it in arts and culture - and this place does it.

They had a local market today and a photography exhibit so definitely always something artsy to do if you are bored in the neighbourhood.

More often than not food for me has been secondary to the event and say, whatever cocktail I am having. On this day's venture, it was brunch. They have two spaces: the cafe and melody bar.   The latter of the two was the only one open for dining in. I believe it re-opens for dinner. 

Had their Gladstone Breakfast 2.0 Not too bad because of the twist to it brought on by the chef's Filipino influence. It was the first time I had longanisa sausage as an option.  It was good but I admit I would rather have had it with rice. Potatoes just don't do this justice.

 The second surprise was the sourdough toast. I love this flavour of bread.  I took for granted how normal if not routine it was on a Vancouver brunch plate. I rarely come across this in Toronto. The usual option is rye bread which pales in comparison but ya know - I take what I can get. 

I also ordered a drip coffee. It had a really good finish -  a nice body with this smooth, crisp finish. Rather curious of the roaster. I would order that again.

All in all not too bad. I'd give the spot more a 3.5.

Comfortable chill space.  For brunch definitely good for any group size even peeps with kids. There's a an expanse of space to keep everyone happy."}
{"text":"Staff advises to take a seat. Leaves you at table for 10-15 minutes without water or menu. When orders are not correct, do not take ownership or apologize. We understand things happen. After the 2nd order coming out incorrectly of a basic menu (eggs, bacon. Common people!) had to ask for manager. Manager was good at trying to save situation. 

If you have 2 hours to wait for eggs and bacon with toast served as crust only, this is the place you can send all your haters. It ranks a 1* because the manager actually tried to take ownership after we had to bring the issues to their attention. 

1/5*"}
{"text":"Is it possible to do a review on the Gladstone and not draw some comparison to The Drake (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/drake-hotel-toronto-2) that also got itself all cleaned up and ready for the impending gentrification of Parkdale?  Oops.  Too late.  Yes, both of these places have been worked on from the ground up and provide fully functional hotel facilities, dining, performance venues and décor that is a complete throwback to the Art-Deco times of old.

The main difference between the Gladstone and the Drake probably boils down to a point of artistry.  Whereas the Drake appears poised to provide one of the great performance venues in the city, the Gladstone provides another option.  This is not to say that the Gladstone is ill-equipped for a show.  It is more than able to put on a great live performance for music, comedy, what have you.  The Gladstone's differential is that it steers more towards art than performance art.  On the Gladstone website (http://www.gladstonehotel.com), you find links to not only its event venues, but also a schedule of the art exhibitions and events that are being performed.  Add to this that many if not all of the rooms are designed by local artists, and you can see the tack they have wised to take.

The Drake and the Gladstone:  The same but different.  But in either case, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Staying at the Gladstone was such a wonderfully unique experience.  The hotel was very accommodating when we experience delays getting there due to winter weather conditions.  The room was warm and cozy, the homemade soaps where a special touch. We had breakfast in the morning at the cafe... the food was fresh, local, and amazing.  We're planning on coming back in the summer!"}
{"text":"We stayed in the Canadiana room last time and this time we stayed in the snapshot room. The Canadiana room was more spacious whereas snapshot is a lot smaller. The shower is puny and there isn't much room for you to move around in there. Still the hotel is really cute and love the old school manual elevator. Karaoke night fri and sat - hear the good and bad, go up and sing, no one cares if you're bad. A bit pricey but in a very hip neighborhood with lots to see and great places to eat. Perfect for young couples !"}
{"text":"I have to say, I loved my stay at the Gladstone Hotel. My workmate was in a room directly over the performance venue in the hotel and the 30 piece afro-cuban orchestra, while awesome, did not make sleep easy for her, but I slept like a baby. I wandered around enjoying all the art on display. I slept in the Skygazer Room created by artists Celeste Toogood and Christopher Martin which is a dense white on white sculpture full of hidden secrets winks and hellos - incredibly peaceful and kind on the eyes, cozy and beautiful and zen. 

The front desk service is funny, cool but not cooler than thou, and incredibly helpful, including changing all my linens at 1 o'clock in the morning when I got back to the hotel and realized I was allergic to everything. Super fun location, especially during the film fests, a little chichi but it's a two minute walk to more kinds of fun on Ossington and, if you're in the right room, a lovely little respite from the noise."}
{"text":"It's not everyday that you check into a hotel that seconds as an art gallery. The Gladstone is a boutique hotel nestled in the art district of Toronto. It has beautiful decor which includes art installations everywhere, a cool 100 yo elevator and a pleasant staff. The rooms all have different themes with different types of art installations in them. Listen, it's not a 5 star hotel in the traditional sense, but it is very unique and you will appreciate that uniqueness."}
{"text":"After stumbling upon the Café @ The Gladstone Hotel online, and drooling at the Brunch menu a bit (as soon as I saw BANANA BREAD FRENCH TOAST nothing else on the menu mattered), I decided to check it out a few weeks later with a group of fellow brunch-loving foodies.

Note: Do not confuse the Café @ The Gladstone Hotel with GLADSTONE CAFÉ, that happens to be right across the street (half of our party made this mistake, lol.)

Walking into The Gladstone, the décor is gorgeous. There's some beautiful art sprawled about the different areas of the hotel, so make sure to take a peek if you pop by.

The service was okay. While we had made reservations online a few weeks in advance, the staff did not seem to be aware of any reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy, so our table was quickly prepared and we were seated shortly thereafter. 

No ingredients left to make Maple Lattes. Sadface. They don't make mochas. Super sadface. They literally JUST changed the menu and among a few other delicious sounding items, the banana bread French toast is no longer on the menu. Super DUPER sadface + a side of heartbreak. No matter, I decided to order the Egg Mike Muffin, which is their spin on an Egg McMuffin: Egg White Custard, Home Made Sausage Patty, \"Sizzler Sauce\" (which reminded me a bit of chimmichurri) and  aged cheddar. This was actually quite tasty! The potatoes served with it, however, were bland and added nothing to the dish. I left 95% of them.

Overall the brunch was good, but not good enough to bring me back compared to some of the fantastic brunch gems in the city. I will definitely be back at some point to try the dinner, even if just for an excuse to check out the gorgeous art again."}
{"text":"Amazing karoke, fun bar, great people, reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Rooms were dirty and the customer service was horrible.  The only thing this place has going for itself is the club sandwich in the cafe. Best of luck you will never see me at your hotel again!"}
{"text":"Individuell von diversen Künstlern gestaltete Zimmer, ein historischer Aufzug, der nur vom Personal betrieben werden darf, eine gemütliche Bar mit wunderbarer Küche, tägliche Abendveranstaltungen in der zweiten Barlocation im Hotel, zuvorkommendes Personal - was will man mehr!?! 

Die Lage ist am Rande der hippen Queen Street mit zahlreichen kleinen, individuellen Geschäften, tollen Restaurants, Bars etc. Über die Entscheidung im Gladstone Hotel gebucht zu haben, bin ich jetzt - 2 Wochen danach - noch überglücklich!"}
{"text":"Stayed for three nights over the summer with my boyfriend. We got a great rate from Jetsetter and from the get-go the staff was great- they let me pick which room I wanted via email. We arrived and promptly fell in love with the old fashioned elevator complete with elevator-operator guy, art filled space and cool bar. The room (Faux Naturelle) was awesome, toeing the line between trendy and tacky in a really appealing way. It's true, the showers are really tiny, but it didn't pose a problem for us and the bath products were exceptional (I might still be using the pharmacopia soap I acquired on the visit!). Totally decent complimentary coffee in the morning, and a great location. A-game."}
{"text":"I have never actually stayed at the Gladstone, but have booked rooms, and been to many of their events. 

The service here is always very patient and friendly, and all the reservations staff do their best to accommodate your needs. I have tried to book anywhere from 1-7 rooms at once, and they always do their best to accommodate my requests, while still being frank about what the situation is (i.e. if they will likely not be able to swing something). 

This place feels like a community abode as they are constantly running events, classes, doing exhibits, etc. as well as having weekly things like legs and lagers (where you can let your inner child out and play with lego, do colouring pages, play giant jenga, all while sipping on your beer). My favourite events are always their summer and Christmas beer events where local breweries come with their craft and you can sample everything. The hotel itself is eclectic and very cozy (though I've heard it can get drafty in the winter, so take note). 

I love this place and am glad it hasn't been redone like the rest of the area."}
{"text":"Great place to hold events!

VENUE
I was attending an event held in the \"melody bar\" I think (the room east of the lobby) and I can honestly say this place is great for events.

This room can fit 100+ people, the washrooms are clean and the atmosphere is cozy.

MIX-UP
Unfortunately, the venue accidentally double booked us and we were in the room with a smaller stage. The smaller stage is only big enough for a 4 piece band and minimal equipment. 

Eventhough there was a mix-up, the staff still acted professional and tried their best to make the event run smoothly.

STAFF
The staff were very attentive, patient and quick. Excellent!

MY SHOE
There is a ramp area to walk to the back of the room.  There must have been a hole or something b/c my  heel got caught, I fell and part of my heel broke off. 

Other than that, I would definitely suggest this place to hold events."}
{"text":"I visited this place for brunch at the cafe. Ordered the eggs benedict which came with a side of fries. The food was good, with decent service. The place wasnt too packed."}
{"text":"The Gladstone hotel is that place you can go to any time of day or night. The morning they serve a fantastic breakfast in a warm and cozy cafe, with an astonishing amount of tea to choose from, and a great coffee. For lunch you HAVE to get the tacos, as they are the best in toronto, period. For dinner, go in and try a wide selection of craft beers and carefully crafted cocktails. the night scene here is perfect. If you want to dance, you can, if you want to share a table with friends and chat, you can do that as well.

Simply put, the gladstone is my second home, and Im very happy its in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This eclectic little piece of Toronto's history holds a special place in my heart. As a model and makeup artist I have frequented this hotel, often shooting in the various rooms all designed in different themes.

Meant more for the novalty, designed by a variety of artists each room embodies a certain vision and the range is rather interesting. From the modern styling of \"Snapshot\" or \"Offset\"... to the Eclectic styling of \"Echame Flores\" or \"Racine\"  each room offers a completely different visual experience

I wouldn't necessarly recommend this hotel as my first choice for a tourist as the rooms can be cramped and offer little luxuries (at no charge ;) as the ambience and decor seem to be the primary focas of the establishment. Parking can also be a bit of an issue as the hotel does not offer a private lot but I do believe they validate for parking in the back at the No Frills.
Larger suites are available at an increase in price; the prices in general are fairly reasonable considering you are almost in the heart of Toronto and the location is becoming more trendy by the min, with a variety of decent art galleries and shops lining Queen st. and in walking distance. 

There is Karaoke and many other live bands and acts showcasing in the bar downstairs, and the food, although rather expensive is not bad and offers a pretty interesting selection that varies. There are Local Artist showings and galleries available for viewing as well which can be a very interesting thing to see.
I have never been disappointed with service here, whether I am grabbing a beer with friends and wondering if they've arrived or trying to find the room I'm going to be shooting in the staff has always been kind and helpful.

One way or the other I will certainly be back to the Gladstone to enjoy the eclectic atmosphere, live bands and pleasant service"}
{"text":"I love the idea behind the Gladstone. Part gallery featuring local artists, part hotel, part bar, part cafe... but strangely enough with all these components, I felt like something was missing. Maybe they're trying to do too many things at once, rather than do fewer things, but do them really well?

Some notes about the Gladstone, mostly about the hotel portion:

-The rooms are pretty small, so be prepared to have your buffer zone infiltrated. We were able to stay in two different rooms (418 and 412(?) )during our stay, since the first one was too loud (due to a music festival event in the ballroom directly below). Both rooms are about the same size, maybe one (412) ever so slightly larger than the other (418). 
-Clean bathroom, but the shower was tiny and it could have used a tad more counter space.
-Girls (or guys) with long hair, BRING YOUR OWN SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER! In an effort to be unique and green, the Gladstone uses bar shampoo/conditioner (two in one). It was fine after Day 1, but by Day 3 my now bird nest hair was begging me for conditioner.
-Free wifi, but they charge for all phone calls made, even local calls
-Nice karaoke bar downstairs filled with what seemed like a mostly twentysomething hipster crowd

All in all a good experience. Beautiful hotel, cool elevator, clean rooms, good location for those not wanting to stay in the middle of a tourist area, friendly staff... though I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to my parents or other families, since it seems to get pretty loud in the evenings."}
{"text":"The Gladstone Hotel

In Toronto's recently gentrified West End District artists, scenesters, and the in-the-knows gather at the once downtrodden and now happily happening Gladstone Hotel.  But thankfully the Gladstone hotel does not adopt its new-fangled success by cutting off its past entirely.  The décor of the bar, lobby, and restaurant is a mélange of antique brick, wood and chandeliers, sparking a perfect marriage between the hotel's slummy history and sassy present.

The bar and café are always action-packed, especially notable is the hilarious karaoke on weekends and the fresh peach Bellini's for the morning after.   If you are too drunk to drive home, your voice is too hoarse from belting out \"Sweet Caroline\" repeatedly, and you have PLENTY of cash in your wallet, then stay the night in one of the rooms, each room is unique and designed by a different Toronto designer.  My favorites are the Red Room and the Sky Gazer but you can take your pick, there is a photo album conveniently placed on the lobby desk for you to peruse."}
{"text":"Came by last night and had the cauliflower burger and whatnots. Super delicious. Service was great. Atmosphere awesome. Washrooms clean and modern. Full marks !"}
{"text":"came here for brunch. They didnt have wat I wanted. Took forever for our food to come. The waiter had an attitude.  He didnt seem happy to be serving us. Dont really know what it was. I found it pricy since all I had was a yogurt parfait and when it came it was like a LIbERte greek yogurt cup size.  I didnt enjoy it here at all. I think its a complete different atmosphere at night time."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends and great service and food! It was under renovations during the time but the manager still gave us the best quality service possible. Would love to come back and see the new renos."}
{"text":"Gladstone Hotel... 

I visited this establishment last week. It was my first time in Toronto. This place is a very fine place to stay at. It is the oldest operating hotel in Toronto, and still maintained the history behind it as well bringing in the unique artsy feel. 

Like previous reviewer have noted, they have 3 sections to the hotel. The hotel portion, the cafe to the left which is a room to a live music venue, and to the right of the lobby is the 'Melody Bar' which was hosting karaoke night. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating to their guest. We asked for a room switch because during our stay it was CMW (Canadian Music Week) which had live performers playing through 1am. And for a old building like that sound travels pretty well throughout the building. SO they were kind enough to switch our room without any complains and continually asked us if the switch was better suited for us. 

The hand cranked elevators is a cool piece of history they maintained.. The art pieces during our stay presented the old industrial Toronto. I loved the uniqueness of their design and layout. Each room has a different theme and design. 

It is convenient to get around if you stay here. It has the TTC line that will take you to downtown and there is good amount of taxi driving around this area so it is easy to catch a cab. If you want to travel on foot it takes about 30 mins to get into the financial district.  

Cons:

-No parking around the area ( Absolutely hard to find, around the corner you park there, but you must leave by 4pm or else you get towed. Based on experience =(   

-They charged us for making local calls or even calls out with calling cards ( Like me calling the tow company to find our car)


Overall : I would recommend this one of a kind hotel just keep in mind of parking is a pain."}
{"text":"I know it is one of the most over used phrases on yelp but it just seems like it calls for it. \"I really wanted to like this place.\"

I really dig the overall look of this place. I am not someone who only stays at chain hotels and needs everything they offer. Every room at the Gladstone is designed by a different designer so no room looks the same - cool idea. The Ace hotel in Seattle and Portland also have a similar idea, but different vibe. So my biggest issue with the gladstone was that I chose to stay there when it was my first time visiting Toronto and the hotel was rather far from downtown and all the stuff I wanted to see. I know this is something the Gladstone cant change but I think its something other people need to realize if they are visiting Toronto for the first time. To make the most of your time in Toronto stay someplace closer to the downtown center. Also about the location of the Gladstone, it is at the end of a new, up and coming \"hip\" area. When I first got to the hotel it was Saturday and Queen street was packed with slutty dressed girls and wanna be too cool guys waiting in line to get into bars and clubs or just standing on the sidewalks smoking and blocking foot traffic. And by the way, the area is much better during the day - cool little restaurants/coffee shops/art galleries that were obscured during the evening by the hipsters out front. Ok enough about the area - it is what it is. 

The room at the Gladstone was small. I thought the Hotel Max in Seattle had small rooms but the Gladstone wins the honors now. Small rooms are fine, you don't need to do much else in the rooms but sleep and shower. But here showering is difficult if you have even been in a RV and used the shower in there - this is about the size of the Gladstone shower... you can hardly turn around.

One fun but odd thing at the Gladstone is the old elevator. You have to get someone to operate the elevator for you so that is sort of a pain if you are on the 4th floor and can't handle the stairs too well. Everyone was very friendly at the hotel, and they even offer free Wi-Fi. But for the price I just am not sure if the Gladstone is worth it. If you're looking for something different and have the cash to burn, then by all means Gladstone is a good time."}
{"text":"This place is giving me mixed signals. On one hand, it's the most adorable little boutique hotel that you ever could imagine and the staff is wonderfully accommodating. On the other hand, the shower doesn't operate too well, the rooms lack complimentary bottled water, the tvs are smaller than a standard ipad and the elevator is cool-looking (original from the 1900s) but it is a total biatch to operate and most times if an attendant isn't there, you're stuck lugging your suitcase up at least one flight of stairs. 

I was leaning between a 3 and 4 star review and decided to skew towards the positive for the additional following reasons: free, fast wifi; a lovely pub/ restaurant serving up yummy food right downstairs; the hotel serves a dual purpose, functioning as an art gallery during the day in addition to a hotel; live music & karaoke goes down in their cocktail bar; the surrounding neighborhood is super walkable, eclectic and there is a ton to do at your fingertips. 

Each room is decked out in various decor in line with a specific theme. From the stargazer to the faux naturale, to the teen queen, biker, and puzzle room, there is no shortage of character here. I stayed in the billio room, which clean, beautiful and comfortable despite the above mentioned shortcomings. Verdict: I'd still probably stay here again if the rates were fair enough."}
{"text":"Just an awesome place on Queen St for any day/night of the week.  Always a good spot for a pint of for a night out.    Several different rooms with different feel/music, I usually love just to chill in the front bar with some friends for a casual drink."}
{"text":"NOTE: this too is a review of the venue's multitude of amenities apart from their hotel services.

I first visited The Gladstone in 2008 for Cajun music dance lessons then dancing to a live Cajun band.  The occasion took place in the venue's Ballroom and I knew quite a few others who attended.  I had a great time.  Since then I've returned to the Hotel many times for other Events and attractions there.  I've viewed the art exhibits on the upper floors, I've been to their annual Nuit Blanche Event once in 2009 and more recently, I've set up Events with a social Group I help run to attend different drinking Events at the venue, namely a beer and food pairing Event in The Melody Bar, a Canada vs U.S.A. Beer Taste-Off in the same part of the Hotel and most notably, their 12 Beers of Summer and 12 Beers of Christmas Events, which feature 12 Breweries located on their 1st and 2nd floors.  During and after the Fest. they have a live band and they've had another Event afterward called Shameless Karaoke.

All of the Events I've attended at the Hotel have for the most part been very well executed.  Their 12 Beers of... Events have had some issues with slow moving lines due to having only one ticket processing table but otherwise they've been great deals (when the beer doesn't run out before the Event ends).  They also have other regular Events and you can check the calendar in their website for upcoming ones.

To summarize, my experiences at The Gladstone have been quite varied and enjoyable through the years."}
{"text":"I live just about 100 steps around the corner from this place, so you'd think I wouldn't have anything to say about a hotel or think about needing it for anything. Just the opposite. It's a fully accommodated guest bedroom for any friends or family visiting in town. It's a coffee shop on the way to work. It's a bar. It's a restaurant for when I give up when I realize I'm out of mayo. Also, this morning, they have a printer at the front desk and I had to print two pesky pieces of paper for Jays tickets. He didn't *bat* an eye. Promise not to abuse it, and promise not to swipe the mayo, either!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today at the Gladstone Hotel Café.

We both ordered the Gladstone Club.  Gord got his with a salad and no tomatoes on his sandwich.  I got mine with fries and no lettuce on my sandwich.  We both agreed that it was a good sandwich.  The bread was good and hearty."}

{"text":"I type this review from Gladstone Hotel's \"Biker Room\" - one of the many themed rooms this cute hotel has to offer. And while I wish I had more time to explore Toronto (and the Gladstone), I'll give a thumbs up for the short and sweet experience here. 

The Good:
-As mentioned, the rooms are all themed so you're sure to get a specific experience! The biker room, while small, has a tiny alcove desk (with Samsung tablet if you're in need), Easy Rider paraphernalia and helmet lamps. Yep. Helmet lamps. Pretty cool.
-The art installations throughout the hotel are pretty groovy. 
-The elevator is incredibly beautiful and old. Just don't try to operate it yourself! 
-Staff was laid back and overall friendly. 
-If you need to hit the gym, you can grab a free pass to 99 Sudbury at the check in desk 
-Free and stable WiFi 
-Great location and super walkable to fun shops and tasty looking restaurants 

The Meh: 
-The dry bar is small and a bit uninspired. Considering they don't offer room service, it would be nice to have a few more options beyond potato chips, pretzels and Clif bars. 
-No room service. You'll have to actually walk down (gasp) to the restos on the ground level and bring it on up to your room 
-Very tiny bathrooms. You would have to be a contortionist to shave your legs in the Biker Room bathroom."}
{"text":"Was treated like dirt from the second I walked in the door, not sure why. Nothing's wrong with the food or the drinks."}
{"text":"My $1,000 Canada Goose jacket was stolen from the hotel's armoire and the front desk attendant said it would be safe there since she would be there all night. DO NOT leave anything of value with them- anyone can walk out with your belongings. This hotel needs to have a COAT check."}
{"text":"Went for a casual brunch on the weekend and was really impressed with the excellent service, great selection (it was hard to decide!) and the lovely ambiance. After brunch we went through the hotel's historic charm and looked at the art exhibits on display. Truly a unique spot in a great part of town."}
{"text":"OMFG. Da Gladstone. I chose you over the close proximity to a concert venue I was going to, but I honestly had NO IDEA how much I would fall in love with you! Here is just a lengthy list of all that made the Gladstone an amazing temporary home for me personally, that I think also for those visiting Toronto and wishing for an 'alternate' view of the city versus the tourist locations.

-The hotel is in Queen Street West, a busy developing residential area that also plays host to the infamous Drake Hotel and the CTV headquarters (and gradually for MTV studio shows). Also plays host to a bunch of hipster joins such as vegan restaurants and art galleries. 
-Speaking of art galleries, every floor (including my own) are open to the public as galleries.
-Every room is designed by a local Toronto artist. My room was the Biker Room designed by Andrew Harwood. (For a video tour of how AWESOME it was, check out the video tour: http://youtu.be/vMrObyRt2Xw)
-Free coffee and tea on your floor in the morning, along with the possibility of ordering specialty teas that will arrive at your doorstep when you arrive.
-Front desk staff was super helpful in finding places nearby to eat, hang out, and whatever you are in the mood for. They also gave me an overview of the TTC and ordered me a cab to the airport when I was leaving. Rad!
-The building plays hosts to Toronto's last operating hand elevator, operated by one of the maintenance persons who reminded me that it was over 100 years old and 4 years older than the plaque outside the door says (history fail?).
-You get a free day pass to a nearby gym, which I unfortunately did not use. You also get a 10% discount on food at one of their cafes or bars on the ground floor.
-The cafe plays hosts to many wines, which are dispensed by the glass from an interesting temperature-controlled machine. The hostess the night, Niki, gave me some great recommendations and even gave me a generous sample of a delicious wine. If you ever have her, start a conversation up about local music such as her band! Maybe she will be able to spark an idea to go to one of their concerts if you are still in town. She was beyond friendly!

This hotel is best for individuals or couples visiting Toronto, so keep that in mind since the rooms feel like decent-sized studio apartments with tall ceilings and a single queen bed. The price is a bit steep a night, but for all the great things you receive (I mean isn't being in the heart of Toronto enough?!), the Gladstone Hotel is definitely one to live up to its' potential!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who lives locally for brunch.  Love this little boutique hotel, the room rate is at par with the Hilton Garden Inn downtown at Peter's Street.  It is much more original.  All the rooms are done by different artist, and there is art displayed in every floor.  There is also an art and craft market  on the ground floor.  Stay there if you can!"}
{"text":"Melody Bar Burger - 3 Stars 

So I had the burger here and thought I'd share for my burger diaries. 
It was a solid burger. They cook it medium but it's stll a bit pink inside. 
It's paired with some fancy mustard and lettuce. 
I was not impressed that they didn't have pickles with the burger. (or hardly any toppings for that matter). One star lost! 
Otherwise, the meat was good. it was a good burger if you're starving and can be served with half fries/half salad. Though if I get this again, I'd opt for all fries. 
Service is excellent, as always."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but the food left something to be desired.  My Chicken Banh Mi sandwich was tasteless and it used bone-in fried chicken, which meant I had to eat it in peices, rather than as a sandwich... Huh?  For the price, I was surprised that the sandwich came with no sides."}
{"text":"My boyfriend won a free night stay at the hotel for work and would not go there ever again even if we were paid to stay there. I've stayed in hostels nicer than this place. It's out dated, not to mention extremely tiny. The floors creek, the shower was so small I could barely shampoo my hair. The monitor was smaller than the computer monitor I have at work. Opposite of luxury."}
{"text":"This review is based soley on the Melody bar, not the hotel.  

Melody bar at Gladstone hotel is a great time!  I've been here a few times for Karaoke, and its always fun.  Its a small place, with Karaoke at the front, and tables, and pool table at the back.  

It looks like a dive, but that's also part of the appeal.  They serve liquor here and getting boozed up is a must.  Come here if you enjoy drinks and karaoke, and singing along with the crowd.  Highly recommended for fri/sat night karaoke"}
{"text":"Rented a specific room here for a wedding, and on arrival was sent to a nondescript and tiny room. After returning to the desk to request the room I booked, I waited two hours and eventually called the desk again before someone came to move me. The room was cool but tiny and only had a very low quality shower. The elevator took 15 minutes. Lent my laptop to the wedding DJ and when I asked for it back at 3AM the night desk were dicks and said they didn't have it. Got it back at 11am the next day. I'm fine with staying in a cheap hotel, but maybe don't charge $200-300 a night, you f***ing assholes."}
{"text":"Went to the cafe for brunch. We had the good morning burger and all the components apart from the egg were extremely dry. The bacon, waffle, and patty seemed like they were made many many hours ago. The waffle was actually stale and I had to wash everything down with coffee. We also had the pork belly tacos and they weren't a whole lot better. We got a single taco on the side and I could swear it was less than half the size of my palm... and the ridiculous thing is that it was $5!  As dissapointed as I was with the quality of the food I was shocked that we paid $45 for it. The only positive point was the service because the food was utterly disrespectful and shocking."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: A Complimentary Classic Room for 1 night, a prize at a Yelp Elite Event.

My stay at Gladstone Hotel was enjoyable! 

Right from the minute I tried booking my room via email because I need to use my certificate. The reservation agent was helpful and friendly. The staffs I encountered during my stay were all professional but has a really laid back vibe.

I stayed in the Puzzle Room (309). The Queen size bed is really firm and comfy so are the fluffy pillows! There is a nice lounge area where all the rooms in my floor shared and complimentary coffee/tea are served every morning.

There are nice amenities in the room includes a Samsung Tablet.. Yes I can Yelp with their free wifi without the need to bring my own netbook!

24 hour streetcar right at your doorstep, but if you are a light sleeper and  have a room facing Queen street, you might need to use the complimentary ear plugs which is one of the amenities!

Gladstone Hotel is definitely a nice boutique hotel if you want to explore West Queen West and the area. Walking distance from a lot of nice restaurants and bars and even shopping!"}
{"text":"Came to the melody bar on \"whisky Wednesday\" with a friend and immediately regretted it. Walking in was awkward, we weren't sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for someone. After standing awkwardly we were finally seated. It was music bingo night.. Which honestly is just not my thing. AND it was disco. The other tables seemed to enjoy themselves which was nice to see, and the host was into the whole thing. I just couldn't escape my introverted self and enjoy. 

Worst part was the food. My friends pretzel was burnt to a char, it was literally black. I'm astonished they even brought him an obviously burnt pretzel. And my tacos were also hard/over cooked.

The place seemed like it was decorated by someone who is different for the sake of being different and not by someone with an eye for decor. My only joy of the night came from my view of the back. Half of the ladies room sign was covered by a curtain, so it looked like \"dies\" with an arrow pointing to a person to its right. Sums up my cringeworthy visit."}
{"text":"The Gladstone is wild. There are any number of fun avenues to traverse in this hep and modern community hub and hotel. There's the Melody Bar which serves as a sinister spot for meetups, tweetups and other shindigs. Cover is usually free, and there are a wide swath of events from live music to arty gatherings to their well-known Karaoke nights.

Then there's the café, which is a full service restaurant during the week, and I believe attaches to the ballroom during weekends. All the food is locally sourced and pretty damned tasty. I've grabbed lunch a few times, and I would recommend the cubano: a pressed roast pork sandwich, with bacon and mustard. Mikey (i.e., me) likes it.

I've also visited for a few community events which are often hosted in the spacious ballroom or the gallery upstairs. The over 100-year-old venue makes it a charming spot for such soirées. Be sure to take the stairs as the elevator is slower than molasses in January during a coldspell under the guidance of a well-meaning turtle.

Then there's the hotel, where I've never stayed and as a native Torontonian probably never will. That said, there is much to see and do at the Gladstone. An amazing spot.

Obligatory Title Pun: Let he who is GLAD cast the first STONE.

Menu Readability: Art design at this place is definitely a forte.

Need to mention: This place is pretty much the catalyst for the redevelopment of West Queen West. Respect.

What this place teaches me about myself: Yeah, sometimes I go by Mikey. Other aliases: Laslo Kovacs, Buster H., Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc, et. al."}
{"text":"Trivia, friends, food, drinks, impromptu karaoke. Where's the bad? Nowhere. There is no bad there. Especially when the staff, from hostess, to server, to bartenders are friendly and helpful.

I was at The Gladstone this past Friday for Friends trivia with a group of eight of my best pals, and ended up staying for Karaoke after. What was going to be a two hour outing turned into a six hour outing, so I think that tells you I was having a good time. The trivia was excellent; hilarious host, well thought out and challenging questions, and a very enthusiastic bunch of Friends fans in attendance. 

The karaoke after was also good. They clearly have some regulars, and a lot of them were pretty good. This is not the kind of karaoke where only half the people can actually carry a tune and no one notices anyway because of they are too wasted. I mean, by 1am there were definitely some people on stage with beer spilled on their shirts, but to their credit they were still singing pretty well. And the audience was super supportive, which is key to any good karaoke venture I think. Kudos to The Gladstone for always being this kind of place: welcoming to all. Last Friday was not my first visit, and it won't be my last either."}
{"text":"I stayed here for 4 nights while exploring Toronto for the first time. The location is really great, it's a hip neighborhood. 
Our room was 70's theme, it had the weirdest furry wall mural of all time. Most comfortable bed I've ever experienced, ever. Very friendly staff and service, including the bar. Had a wonderful stay."}
{"text":"This is where my lady and I come to have brunch when we want to deal with as little wait as possible. Never had to wait (been here with 4 people) and the food and service is pretty solid. Great huevos rancheros (although a far cry from the real deal). I would recommend if you're in the area and need a place for a morning in peace."}
{"text":"The Gladstone Hotel is divided into three funhouses - one is the hotel itself, which few Toronto natives will really know about, another is the ballroom café to the left of the lobby, which serves brunch, lunch and dinner and then hosts DJ nights, afterparties and many years ago, the Fake Prom. The third part, the \"Melody Bar\", is to the right of the lobby and it's the tavern area that people may also know as the home of weeknight karaoke but during the day is frequented with old pals, business people and other random locals. 

As I sit here in the tavern munching on my sandwich, I'm enjoying reliable, open wifi (no password required - it just works!), peoplewatching and listening to Christmas carols (no joke - Frosty The Snowman played first and Silent Night followed shortly afterward). What more could you ask for from a work spot, really?

The menu is wonderfully inventive - there's a \"fry bar\" that includes over a dozen fry toppings and eight sauces, duck samosas, deep-fried brie cheese, a ploughman's sandwich, pulled Berkshire pork and a veggie burger that's reputed to be one of the best in the city. 

I ordered the grilled cheese with cheddar, Jarlsberg and warm sliced apples on Ace's raisin walnut bread, and it was served with a small green salad and tomatoes plus paprika spiced fries.

That's called gettin' 'er done in West Queen West!"}
{"text":"Very lovely lobby and reception rooms, we only visited the Hotel to see a band playing at the Meoldy Room, it was really a great venue and great talent! A really nice crowd of people and enjoyable staff and beverages. In my next visit to Toronto I would be very interested in staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Perhaps a bit too trendy for my tastes, but the place has its charm. It's bustling with activity in the arts scene, which is refreshing to see. However, after a long day of traveling, it wasn't exactly the most relaxing joint. The art on the walls, great for a gallery, don't exactly scream hospitality. But the room was nice, if humble, and offered all I needed. And the staff was kind enough.  The location on Queen street means public transportation is easily available. And it's an historic building. Probably wouldn't stay here again, but I'm sure it's someone else's cup of tea, so I can't knock it on yelp based on personal preference."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend Daniel Joyce  for breakfast  I got a sandwich and my friend got eggs but when his eggs came back they were broke and over cooked! Which I can understand happening at a diner for cheap all day breakfast but at the Gladstone really? Anyway my breakfast sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"Yes, the karaoke is hype, the breakfast is good buttttt the creme de la creme of The Gladstone's programming are the Ru Paul's Drag Race viewing parties. These Queens know how to party! Check their calendar and get hype!"}
{"text":"How I adore this place!

i've been here on numerous occasions. The melody bar has the most amazing karaoke with the most talented, hipster turn outs. The Gladstone Cafe also has amazing food. Although the menu is on the pricer side, the quality is worth the value. Brunch and dinner are both amazing here. It's a good splurge once in a while.

The hotel itself is amazing. I booked a room with a groupon for a surprise on my boyfriend's birthday and the staff was amazing from before checkin to checkout. I requested a different theme room and they hooked me up. When I checked in, they were super friendly. The downside of the stay was that the frontdesk staff are responsible requests to the room, such as ice. Otherwise, the room was smaller but gorgeous. The bed was comfortable and luxurious. The bathroom was tiny but immaculate. The room was clean and well-maintained. Nice touches was the tablet in the room for use, would have liked an ipad.... also there was a good selection of munchie food to purchase... I was eying the chocolate pretzels and the bottle of vino. It was a great birthday, my boyfriend adored the room as much as I did! What a treat!

I wish I could live here."}
{"text":"Brunch:
Bacon was clearly cooked hours before and left drying out in an oven or under a light bulb.
Potatoes too were dry and tired.
Eggs were okay.
Plate was uninspired.
Service was slow -"}
{"text":"I totally love the idea of this! I stayed in the Lehtinen Lodge room, no outrageous decor but it was lovely and cozy. The bed was wonderful too. Gladstone also has magnificent shampoo!

Our night came with a complimentary breakfast, which the waiter didn't acknowledge... but we still got it. $30 a breakfast! Food was alright.

I thought the front desk receptionists and waiters were snobs... The bar was okay, it was packed, tables were sticky, service so-so.

The man-operated elevator is awesome!!! What a great touch! I love the galleries too.

Unfortunately, I will return for the hotel but I'm not looking forward to the service at all."}
