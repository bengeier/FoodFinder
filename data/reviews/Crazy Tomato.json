{"text":"Nice to have a pretty good Italian restaurant not too far from me. Went there back in November of 2012. Friendly staff, reasonable ambiance. Not too loud and it's definitely family friendly.  As for the food - it was tasty, the portion sizes good. I liked the freshly baked bread - totally yummy. I had the veal parmigiana - and it was good. It stuffed me quite well!  Definitely worth going back - you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times since it opened BUT called to make a reservation and was told, by a rather unfriendly woman who answered, that they do not make reservations anymore for less than a party of six. Wow...who do they think they are. I can call anywhere and get a table for two, or three, or four or one even!   The food is good but not worth the attitude."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area, and in our search for a great local restaurant, this one certainly caught my eye from the street.  Once in the door, you find you are greeted by very friendly staff and find that the selection and prices are just as pleasing!  I particularly enjoy the Fennel Sausage Pizza.  A thin crust, and sooooo tasty!  Everything I have tried has been very enjoyable, and the mushroom soup was incredible!  Going here takes a little planning on a weekend however... either come really early, or really late to avoid the wait, which I know is worth it, but I'm always too hungry in anticipation to delay the gratification!"}
{"text":"This is what we tried:   Antipasto Platter (tomato and bocconcini, cured meats, olives, artichokes, roasted red peppers, parmigiano) This was a nice and delicious starter to share.  The menu suggests it feeds two, but I thought it was a fair size, especially when supplemented with the bottomless basket of warm house-baked bread.  It wasn't anything innovative, but all of the ingredients were fresh and flavourful.  Spiedini (grilled lamb spiedini with white balsamic reduction) Even my mother, an lamb-o-phobe, enjoyed these dainty spiedini.  The meat was tender with a mild gaminess that was complemented nicely by the sweet sticky glaze.  Grilled Chicken (half chicken topped with wild mushroom brandy jus served with vegetables and crushed potato)  A basic but good main dish.  The chicken was juicy and moist, and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly.  As the mains started to be delivered, however, I noticed how pretty much everything was garnished the same.  Now, I know this is a family establishment, but there is room for a BIT of creativity here, and obviously, some sauces accompaniments complement different foods and flavours better than others.  Just something to think about for enhancing the sophistication a bit......"}
{"text":"We were excited to see this place go in.  Our visit was a Saturday night.  I checked their hours, and we arrived minutes before 9.  The server said to us 'we are closing soon'.  First thing out of her mouth.  Er, I thought you were open until 10?  Can we eat still?  And she said yes (so kind).   My husband and I both ordered pasta.  Nothing was offered while we waited for our order, no water, no bread.  Other staff were stacking chairs.  Really?  Friends of kitchen staff or perhaps off duty staff were hanging at the bar and oven chatting.  We felt like we were crashing someone's private restaurant.  Very odd.  The Manager did seem to sense our discomfort and came by a couple of times but no real effort was made to be hospitable.  May try again for the pizza."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my family this evening just as it was opening for dinner service. Decided to order three pizzas to share amongst the four of us.  We ordered the Diana (cheese and sauce); the Tuscan (chicken, roasted veggies, tomato sauce, cheese) and lastly, we ordered one with potatoes, porchetta, cheese, and an olive oil base (cannot remember the name of it).  First of all there was one large party of about 10 and another table with two people and then us. While we waited for our pizza, no bread was offered, though it was given to the other tables. Was it because we ordered pizza only?? Not sure. Neither owner was there this evening..... so we waited and waited and waited....seemed like forever before the pizza came and my son was finished his drink when the pizza finally did come.  Can't really mess up a cheese pizza, but  when I took a bite of my slice of Tuscan pizza, I bit into something hard. Pulled it out of my mouth kind of worried. It was a small piece of chicken bone. Gross! Turnoff for me. Tried a slice of the potato and porchetta pizza which my son ordered and it was completely (and I mean completely) tasteless and bland.  All three crusts were on the soggy side and not crisp as I had expected. Very disappointed especially since reading previous reviews commenting on the great pizza.   This is our second time visiting this restaurant and I'm just not that impressed, so we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great little place. Had pasta and pizza, both were very tasty. Gotta love wood-fire pizza! Pasta was hand made, there was some beef in it, think it was brisket, super-tasty! Service was good, would come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, which has lacked a nice family restaurant serving food cooked from scratch (rather than ready-to-heat from the likes of Cysco). The location has had trouble retaining a restaurant tenant for many years, but the success of Crazy Tomato is testimony to the old saying about building a better mousetrap. Service is efficient and polite, the cooking is high quality, the range of  drinks is good and prices middle range. The owners, one a chef and one the maitre d, really work hard at making people feel welcome and appreciated -- the kind of feel that's nice in a neighborhood restaurant. My only suggestion: the lighting is a bit too bright and needs variation. Wayne r"}
{"text":"The crazy tomato could not be a more perfect addition to the neighbourhood. I'm so glad this place opened up. For years this location had a restaurant reopening every few months and failing because it had no market in our area.  I went for dinner here a little while ago. I loved the calamari; it was perfectly crispy with a delicious sauce. i would have preferred my gnocchi al dente but still the flavour was delicious. My sister ordered the lemon cheesecake and i the tira masu for dessert. Both were delicious and amazing (we kept stealing bites of each others'). My sister commented on the appropriate portion sizes, which we have always considered to be the downfall of Jawney Bakers. Best of all, the staff and owner were so friendly and welcoming. The whole atmosphere was warm and lovely. Makes me wish I was Italian! This place is definitely a new family favourite. Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"The area failed to sustain several businesses before, but Crazy Tomato proved it could boom. The establishment was rendered a major overhaul from how it used to look like - this, along with the food, service, and the amount of customers they get every night reflect the passion, hospitality, and enthusiasm of the entire staff.   The oven, and the signage, which announced, \"homemade pasta\", attracted our first visit. What made us come back: the generous portion of the seafood linguine, and the scrumptious chicken parmigiana! We also tried one of their pizzas, which arrived as a tasty, thin crust pepperoni that could be shared by two. I find the salad overpriced for the amount of serving though, but it was still refreshing and delectable.  The restaurant is attractive for family gatherings, while it still provides a nook for a full bar. Saturday nights, they are usually packed, but even if their parking lot is full, you can find other spots within its 1-km radius. It didn't take us a long time to be seated too - maybe we got lucky, but the food was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First things first, the 4th star is earned relative to the neighbourhood it's in.  This is a good, affordable Italian restaurant, not much more, not much less.  Thoroughly enjoyed my pizza, the bruschetta and the spiedini, but the calamari was pretty full of batter and oil, kind of disappointing.  They'd be better off to just grill it (plus it would increase their margins).  Regardless, the service was killer and pleasant, the atmosphere great for conversation, and the price was just about right (6 people with drinks for about $200).    It's a great option that the neighbourhood's been missing, and a nice staple to have in my backyard (ish)."}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here, everything was perfect! I don't know much about wine but I asked our waiter for a recommendation and he chose one that really hit the spot! Food was delicious, atmosphere was really pleasant, and staff... the staff was the best. Such friendly and genuine people! I'm glad we got talked into ordering dessert after stuffing ourselves.. it was probably the best desert I've had all year.  Easy 5! Definitely coming back. Also, I thought our bill would be really hefty, but it was very reasonable"}
