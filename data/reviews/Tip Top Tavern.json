{"text":"Was there yesterday for lunch.  Trying to eat healthy so I ordered the sauteed vegetable sandwich (served on a french baguette - probably not real healthy but ya' gotta live a little - right?).  The sandwiches are served with chips and a side salad.  Our Server knew I was trying to eat healthy, so she offered me a double serving of the side salad and to skip the chips.  I took her up on that offer.  The sandwich was excellent.  All the ingredients were very fresh and the prices were right!  My sons each got the \"Sconnie\" sandwich and paid a small up-charge for the french fries. They said the sandwich was awesome as were the fries. Our Server was very pleasant.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Tip Top Tavern offers a wide variety of pub food and live music options. A group of friends and I stopped in on Thursday night for a performance by a local band. Although the event was extremely entertaining and fun, there was very limited seating which resulted in half of our group awkwardly standing in a location that was blocking the door. I would definitely recommend showing up early if their is live music schedule. In terms of the food, the prices are extremely affordable! I would definitely recommend Tip Top Tavern if you are looking for a quaint venue with comfort food and a local vibe."}
{"text":"My husband and I came back here for burgers on a Sunday night.  Here's my rundown: -Service-5 stars, our server was friendly, attentive and prompt. -Atmosphere-4 stars, cozy bar atmosphere -Food-3 stars, Good but not great by my Madison burger standards -Price-3 stars, A little over the top for what it is (pretty sure the meat is just conventional), everything is a la carte so a burger with fries can put you over $12-14. -Payment-1 star, They only accept cash and check, the ATM charges a $2 fee.  Honestly this really annoys me because it is the servers who end up paying for it.  We left a good tip but I know a lot of people are not going to want to after being charged $2 plus whatever their bank charges just to get $$ to pay for dinner.  Honestly I think it is a greedy policy and they should change it (or do what Jennifer street market does and refund the ATM fee for those who need to use the ATM).  Their servers deserve better."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to the new and improved Tip Top. So my last stop at Tip Top was many years ago and needless to say I was so happy to see it had been renovated.  My husband and I arrived at 5:15 on a Friday night. There were several tables open and we grabbed a table for two. The bartender acknowledged us and a server was at our table before we had our coats off. The tap beer menu is impressive with local beers. I was surprised to see a local new release at $4 for a pint. I ordered the cod baked and my husband had cod deep fried. I ordered baked potato \"loaded\" and hubby french fries. So while we enjoyed our beer the place filled all tables within 15 minutes. The interior has been completely redecorated in a very comfortable art deco. I love it! I think there were 9 tables (could be separated into a couple more) along with window and bar seating. The baked cod is the BEST I have ever had,generous portion tender and flaky, the house made coleslaw and tartar sauce were perfect. My loaded baked potato had crispy smoked bacon, melted cheese and parsley-so good! The fries were perfect wedges. The food arrived quick and hot.  Ben, the owner, was making rounds to meet and greet. The atmosphere is beautiful and comfortable. HIGHLY recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"An outstanding, quaint, neighborhood bar.  Always a solid tap list, and the food is very good.  The cocktail menu is pretty creative too.  We've been there for breakfast on the weekends and dinner and I would recommend both.  Can get a little loud in there when it's rockin', but who cares.  Nice outdoor part too when the weather gets nice."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday with a pretty big group of ten plus we sat on the patio which was very nice. The waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently :).  This was the first time I had been there since it was redone and I really liked how it looked.  My friend and I tried the Chipotle Chicken and Wild Rice soup it was so delicious even on that very hot day so kudos to that!  I also tried one of the fried pickles with the sauce it came with it was also very good! Had a good time here."}
{"text":"Food:  The fried pickles with special sauce are very good.  The breading is like the batter from a good fish fry, and the pickles are cut in deliciously thin chips.  The sweet potato fries were also quite good, but they were cold when they got to us.  I always appreciate it when a restaurant goes the extra mile to make their own vegetarian burger.  This one was fair and had a southwest flavor to it.  The macaroni and cheese (which does not come with the cilantro or parsley mentioned on the menu) was pretty bad.  You could eat the top layer off, but the bottom layer was completely flooded with oil.  Service:  The server was very friendly and courteous.  However, we only got a refill on the water when the check came.  Like most pubs, be prepared for a pretty good wait before you get your food.  And, there appeared to be some issue with misplacing our appetizer order.    Atmosphere:  Fun and kind of hipster.   There is a nice outdoor patio, but be aware that it is dog friendly.  This means that you may have someones poorly trained dog licking your feet during dinner.  This also means that all of the servers and staff will pet the dogs while handling your food.  If this is a concern for you, consider a different restaurant.  Price: Very reasonable.  Starters were about $5 and entrees were less than $10.  Payment:  Cash only  Parking: Street, but there seemed to be plenty of spaces.  I love Tip Top Tavern's sister restaurant - Lazy Janes - and I would like to come back for brunch.  And, the new ownership has done some great things to the restaurant.  But, I would not come back for dinner.  The food was fair to poor, and the dog issue is unappetizing."}
{"text":"My wife & I have been to the Tip Top several times. We don't go there anymore because we like tap beer & without exception every time the tap beer tasted off. My guess is they don't clean the tap lines frequently as other places. With that said the food is good & the atmosphere is nice. Not having good tasting tap beer is a deal breaker for us."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing  food and the best craft brew selection.  Great atmosphere and service.  The Texas Brisket tacos were over the top.  Stopped in on a Monday and enjoyed live music in a cozy beer garden.   Well done Al!"}
{"text":"Been here many time and the atmosphere and food are excellent. This is such a great addition to an up and coming neighborhood. Just what was needed. Comfortable and cozy atmosphere, hip owner, cook and waitstaff. Go for the Sunday brunch. You can't go wrong with any of the selections on the menu. If you're here for drinks, order the cheese curds too. Sunday night jams bring in quality talent and no cover. Don't forget to check out the patio seating."}
{"text":"A really welcoming warm place to gather with friends and enjoy a drink and a burger. A neighborhood bar that really cares about the neighborhood to boot. Love the Tip Top!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this spot 4 stars -- but man oh man! We arrived early, and like another reviewer said, we had to wait FOREVER for service. We got menus, but no water. When the server finally came to take our drink order (15-20 minutes after our party arrived), we ordered wine and also asked for water. Our drinks came out 10 minutes apart, and we never did get that water.  The food is tasty. The fish fry is overpriced. The interior is fun and adorable -- the kind of place that inspires you to hang out with friends and linger over your meal.  But man -- don't go when there's even a chance it will be busy, because the service can be dreadfully slow."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Madison this place was a scary  D-I-V-E!  The refurb is beautiful and the menu is inspired and tasty.  Plus the women's bathroom is like a sanctuary with a tantalizing Prince image keeping watch while you do your business.  Try the mac and cheese; you'll cry.  This corner is really hopping with upcoming new restaurants and a Cabaret (?!) nightclub across the street.  All in the shadow of that empty Oscar Mayer behemoth.  What will become of the Eken Park neighborhood?  I imagine bearded and stylish Veronians are buying up those tiny houses right now, just to be near the Tip Top!  Dec. 2016 update: In town to visit and HAD to visit Tip Top again.  Great time on a cold night.  Sconnie sandwich is fantastic!  Reuben = delicious.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch.  We got there early, around 10, so it was not busy.  The service was good, as was the food.   The veggie patty was excellent! I like the coffee bar so that you don't have to wait for someone to refill your cup.   I will go back."}
{"text":"What a great little menu for a reinvented local pub. Wonderful sandwiches and great beer menu. The outdoor are converted from the old parking lot is perfect.   I hope to see a more extensive menu but the size of the kitchen makes a small menu understandable."}
{"text":"What started out as one of Madison's most infamous dive bars (if you got kicked out of everywhere else you could always go to the Tip Top) has quickly transformed into one of the east side's hidden gems. Tip Top Tavern is an authentic Midwestern bar experience. Great burgers, warm atmosphere, and a great tap list. I haven't met a single person who hasn't been charmed by the this place. Any time I touch down at the Madison airport and I haven't eaten anything but complimentary pretzels in the last several hours, Tip Top Tavern is where I go to feel at home.   Check it out on Friday for their awesome fish fry, or on their open mic night on Sunday for the best free entertainment in town."}
{"text":"I did not order food and I went to see a band. I had heard great things about this place. OK so they have those glasses that look like normal ones but are way more slender to cheat you out of some of your drink, they poor super light and only filled it to once inch below the line. It was as like 2 and 1/2 ounces for $7. Not cool. I did like that they did not have TV's and the band was amazing but the female bartender poored super light and knocked my garnish out and looked at it and did not replace it. Not a great experience really."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly owner and delicious drinks and grub. Tip Top Tavern revamped is waaaaay better!"}
{"text":"In the midst of a snow storm, awaiting an iffy flight from Madison, the Tip Top Tavern was an unexpected refuge.  A true corner tavern, the TTT sits incongruously in a residential neighborhood. Beautifully designed, with an old school concept, a long bar meets patrons with a few tables scattered about. A second room is provided to accommodate more seating.   Service is warm, friendly and Wisconsin nice. All the food is made from scratch using a locally sourced farm to table philosophy.  My cheeseburger soup was hearty and delicious, and one cup filled me up. The chile mac and cheese had a nice \"tang,\" with the requisite crispy top. The menu was varied and unique.  Take a look on their website.  TTT's clientele was eclectic, older folks and young hipsters all enjoying the welcoming vibe. This was one cool bar, and I will return on my next sojourn to the Badger state. If I lived in Madison, I would be here often."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite east side hang outs. Despite its size also being a deterrent when finding a location for groups, the quaint corner-bar-size gives this neighborhood bar its charm. It can get noisy in there and fills quickly so arrive early. The patio is beautiful, seems more spacious than the inside, and has table service. The pergola provides for decent shade in the summertime for those of us intolerant of the sun. There are few east side patios not in the blazing sun so TTT is somewhat of a gem.  Staff treats you well and is knowledgeable about the cocktails and beer. The beer - fun selection of highly local craft beers on tap; seems to be different options each time I've visited. I would prefer more lager options. I'm yet to try and looking forward to the Chili Mac and Cheese (how couldn't that be great?) and live music (outside preferred)."}
{"text":"Drinks are tops.  No pun intended.   Well, maybe just a little.  But I like trying new beers, and my wife likes their mixology.  The bartends/mixologist are consistent.  Now consistent will be significant in this review.  Because in the end, that's how you get your money as a business.    As bar food goes, it's better than most. Not great.  But consistently good.   And I'll take \"consistently good\" over \"great\" any time.   It means that this place gets to be my go-to place when I don't know what I want to eat.  I really like their fish fry, although I go for their baked cod.  Each time it has been cooked perfectly and never over cooked.  I've tried my companion's fried fish, and it is crunchy and thanks to our speedy waitress, really hot ( but not overcooked).   I'm happy to live in this neighborhood so that even when I don't feel like cooking I can just walk to the bar for dinner.  I look forward to wandering through the menu.  More to come."}
{"text":"We went to Tip Top on a Saturday night. The lights were low and jazz music was playing in the background. Just a few tables were open, but it didn't have that crowded feeling. Our waitress came after a few minutes with both a drink and food menu. We each ordered a beer from their rotating tap menu, which includes Wisconsin and some regional beers. Nice list with good variety. My partner ordered the special, which was a burger with jalapeños, an onion ring and other toppings. I ordered the Build Your Own option. I went with a chicken breast with all the free toppings possible. I subbed sweet potato fries instead of the chips.   We both agreed that the food and beer at Tip Top was top notch, but the ambiance was a little annoying after a while. Plus, our waitress was just okay. She came maybe only twice to our table, once to take our order and then to deliver our check. But, for a neighborhood sport, this place is fine. We will be back, perhaps in the summer when the patio is open!!"}
{"text":"After cleaning his plate, husband declared that this was the best Madison fish fry he's had. Then he proceeded to finish what was left of my veg burger (because it was just too good)!"}
{"text":"I could say \"This is a tip top spot!\" but that would be CHEESY and my New Year's resolution 23 years ago was to avoid such things.  ANYways. I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot. A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling. Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site.  My co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday. The place seemed to have a \"must order food\" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on. Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!  The Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place. The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite...   All in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  I hope they are able to work out the kinks along the way (i.e., must order food to get a seat policy) but overall think this is a very nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super friendly bartender, nice selection of beers and while not the best Reuben in town, certainly deserves to be in the conversation. Plus, the sweet potato waffle fries with the Tip Top jam was fun.  After my last two very disappointing meals at the bar down the street, I have found my new North St. hangout."}
{"text":"I love the Tip Top Tavern.  Looks like a bar. Loads of wood, loads of light and and a very positive vibe.  The bar and tables are always clean and service is excellent.  I am a mixed drink girl and there are plenty of choices on the menu. I can taste the alcohol which is not always the case. Great Bloody Mary's.  Most recently I shared a burger and a tuna melt with my son. The burger was excellent, perfectly cooked and oh so tasty. The tuna melt was not my thing. My son felt the same.   Great space and good food. How can you lose?"}
{"text":"Patio season has arrived!  This is my go to walk-to-able neighborhood bar and in the summer it's the first patio I look forward to visiting!  They have a great wooden lattice over half the patio that defuses light and lots of greenery. It looks like this year they've added a tree to the middle of the patio which will add shade and atmosphere as it grows.  Plenty of bike parking and street parking if it's too far to walk for you.  They have a great beer tap list that is shorter than some but offers plenty of variety and options. They also offer a few bottles and great artisan cocktails,  I've tried a few of their appetizers and entrees. I really enjoy their veggie burger, their fish fry and their gourmet grilled cheese.  My only complaint is the fact that they are cash only even though they take all their orders on fancy tablets... It just doesn't make sense to me. They do have an ATM on the premises but it's a real bummer to pay a fee. They do take checks, I guess it's just a little old fashioned for my taste! This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and quality."}
{"text":"We love love love that the Tip Top is near our home. If you haven't been since the remodel and ownership change, you're missing out. It is adorable inside and the back patio is nice as well as spacious. There is a little side room now in the front with a fun cabin vibe. I had dinner here last night with my husband, his mom and stepdad. Three of us had a burger - I had the Tip Top burger, which I adore and keep ordering every time although I should order something new. The two who had the build your own burger were happy as well. Great quality meat, cooked well. My only complaint, and I have this complaint other places too - I order my burger medium and it cam out medium well and then some (no pink at all). Sweet potato fries and onion rings were great. I appreciate that the side salad is mixed field greens with a fantastic balsamic vinaigrette. Our server was a genuinely nice person and was attentive with out being a PITA. Don't forget it's cash only, we always manage to forget.... there is an ATM onsite, but the fee is high enough that it bugged me. Oh! You know how a lot of restaurants like this with upscale pub food are charging $6,7,8,9 for beers? And I mean your run of the mill things, not super special hard to get beer. The Tip Top is one of the cool-ass places not jumping on that train. My 2 hearted was $4. Husband's Potosi also $4."}
{"text":"Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience.  Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.   Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.    We had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.    Twelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere.  Hope you do well Tip Top!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest here.  I like reubens.  Tip Top has best reuben I have had in Madison.  Best.  Here it is folks.  I probably shouldn't let you in on this because that's one less reuben for me.  This bad boy has the perfect balance of thick cut pastrami, kraut and 1,000 island sauce with ample melty Swiss on sour dough rye.  Damn.  I challenge anyone to find a better reuben.  You should try it with the Tip Top sauce instead of 1000 island.  Outrageous.  Please remember to tip handsomely and you're welcome."}
{"text":"The Tip Top is a great low-brow neighborhood tavern with a charm that eludes many larger, more \"upscale\" establishments. The service is prompt but unpretentious and the beer selection keeps up with what's popular along with a couple of offbeat offerings to make things interesting. Having dined at the TTT three times now I can say that everything I have ordered thus far has been really tasty and the reasonably priced. It's a place I will return to again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Cash only good service not a sports bar people with class mix crowd come here words cant explain very exquisite place to stop by good beer collection on tap felt like home with little culture to it from Washington, D.C."}
{"text":"I live 3 blocks from the Tip Top. I love that its great reputation has drawn positive attention to Eken Park. But, what I don't love.... Cash only really sucks. I spend, on average, twice as much at nearby Dexters because I can use my card. It's insulting that their ATM fees benefit the owners of the TT, rather than subtracting their large ATM fees from the tab. Also, the menu at TT hasn't changed in quite a while. I am sure I'm more sensitive to this because I can frequent this more often than a west-sister, but I am tired of their boring selections. Come on guys, you're part of the Mickeys and Lazy Janes family...you can do better."}
{"text":"I never went into the old Tip Top (because I was far too terrified) but there is no way it held a candle to the current Tip Top.   Basically, the place looks fantastic from ceiling to floor. It now makes sense why the remodel took so long and it was clearly worth the wait. It's exactly what you'd want a neighborhood bar to be. Small but not too small, inviting atmosphere, comfortable lighting, and no over the top decorating.   I had a beer and a very good whisky sour. Looking forward to heading back soon."}
{"text":"We stopped for drinks and ended up eating dinner here. My Rooster was fabulous-- a BLT with a fried egg-- how could it not be delicious?? The service was spotty. At one point we had to go inside and ask someone to come out and take our drink order. The outdoor seating area is really nice, beer on tap is average."}
{"text":"I like this place and like even more that it is a short bike ride from my house.  The soup is always great and the burgers are often as well.  I got a mushroom swiss burger on special there once and it was the best mushroom swiss I have ever had.  The fried pickles and cheese curds are great.  As a bar their beer selection is A+.  A little noisy some times but that is mostly the fault of the patrons, the TVs and music were never loud.  Only negative I have had is that they added a brunch menu but it was pretty weak, not many options and what we ordered was not very good.  Some friends had a terrible time with brunch as well with their food taking hours (literally) and then being wrong.  Oh and it gets one more star for replacing the old tavern which was mostly a place to buy cocaine and drink yourself to death.  Just the sort of upgrade the neighborhood could use."}
{"text":"I tried the walnut burger and my friend had the Friday fish fry, both were great. They offered a wide variety of sides. Service was fast and the vibe was lively. A great addition to the East side and a wonderful community establishment. If you're nearby check it out. Everyone there seemed to be really enjoying themselves and the food. Fun drink menu! -cash only"}
{"text":"I love that the best of this classic Wisconsin tavern was preserved whilst providing a much-needed facelift. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.  We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed a few creative cocktails. My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.  We were there again last night with friends for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!  My husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried. He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw. He also liked the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced with dill.  We live less than 2 miles from Tip Top, so we look forward to spending more time there, especially when we can bike there during warmer months!"}
{"text":"I really loved this tavern! The tavern itself is cute and cozy and the staff is super friendly. We went for lunch on a Friday at about 11am and we were able to be seated right away. We ordered the French Nasty Fries which were fries covered in brisket, BBQ sauce, cheese, and sour cream. It's a huge portion that was very satisfying! We also split the Sconnie sandwich and upgraded our side items to cheese curds. Both very good! I would definitely recommend stopping by the tip top tavern! I know that I will be back!"}
{"text":"The place has gotten quite a dramatic face-lift. It looks great. I love everything they've done with the place.  I tried the Tip Top Burger and the chili. The burger was fine, but not spectacular. The chili was really freaking delicious, though. I would highly recommend grabbing a bowl.   The space is pretty small, but there is actually a lot of seating. It does get pretty loud though. The staff members were all very nice and did a great job. The bitchy people  next to us were treated a lot nicer than they deserved. A waiter mixed up an order and was very apologetic and quickly resolved the issue.  Overall, I'm happy that the place is finally open. A welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pretty darn awesome tavern thats for sure. A Madison mainstay thats got loyalists and regulars drom college freshman to senior alumni from UW. Only been here once with my folks for the fish fry friday they do and everyone talks about. I have had better fish frys in my Milwaukee college days but this was was still good looking from what i saw flying out the kirchen. I just had seafood the night before so i was not feeling the fish thing, burger however yes! Byo burger even better! Plus they got sweet fries!!  I built a killer grilled chicken sando as the pics show and i loved it! Prices are great and way better than my norm of san diego tavern food prices! The bells kal haven is an awesome sour rye ale I suggest all sour beer fans try!  It was really busy and they do not take RSVP  but even then us 3 got seated within 10 minutes and were ordering within 10 more. Meals came out about 15 minutes later and we were all quite pleased with the food.   Great vibe, great staff, good beer and awesome grub from a local long standing hotspot. Tell Ben the owner hello when you stop in!"}
{"text":"I have been on two trips to Top Top now, and figured it was time to write a quick review. I've done weeknight dinner and Sunday brunch.  The weeknight we stopped in was a beautiful night for patio eating. My partner and I both had the Tip Top burgers and they were wonderful. Nice albeit modest selection of beers on tap (disclaimer: we moved from Milwaukee where anything less than a novel in a beer menu is modest) and just an all around pleasant experience. Service was good--relaxed but not too distant--and we were in and out in decent time.  Brunch was a few days ago and nearer to memory. I stopped in with a friend who ordered the pastrami hash and I had the veggie benedict. Mint and avocado? Apparently delicious! My only minor complaint on the benedict was that the tomatoes weren't quite ripe, but as my own garden will attest it's been a rough tomato year. My friend who has a gluten allergy was delighted to learn that they offer gluten free bread and said his hash was delicious. It was pretty quiet, just us and a few other people around noon. Hoping other people find this little neighborhood gem soon. Just, you know, not when I want to be there, it's nice to have some room to stretch out ;)."}
{"text":"For a bar, this place is pretty great! The prices are insane for what you get portion wise. I had their Mac and cheese with peppers in it. It was a nice amount of heat, not overwhelming and was delicious! Also had their fries - because when you find a place that doesn't have shellfish/fish or separates friers, you get the fries whether you're hungry for them or not!!! They came out piping hot, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Our server was fantastic, she was courteous, friendly, and very attentive and timely. They also had a fantastic craft beer selection!! I was very amazed, considering this place looked like it was one of the bars I grew up in up north where the fanciest beer you'll find is Leinies (lol). I had a gose from I believe Lagunitas, and it was one of the more delightful beers I've had in a while.  My bestie got the caprese burger. It was perfectly cooked, and had an amazing balsamic reduction on it that just topped it off.  I'll definitely be back. Don't be fooled by the appearance on the outside or in. It's a hidden gem in the north side!"}
{"text":"Ok food, but got worse every time we came back. Now it's like they are not even trying. Also the mix drinks are weak."}
{"text":"Small but high-quality menu selections with locally sourced foods. Good value for what you get.  Great selection of microbrew beers. Our waiter was very attentive and a nice guy.   TheTip Top Tavern has opened again after a major remodel. It was well worth the wait. It is now cozy, cute, and tiny.   Great for those who prefer unique destinations over corporate chains."}
{"text":"Tip Top Tavern is a hidden gem! One look at the outside of this place would send most people looking for another spot. But I urge you, go inside!   The inside is warm and cozy, and the beer garden is beautiful and intimate. They offer a variety of craft beers and cocktails, as well as creative twists on old favorite food options (Poblano Mac and Cheeseeee!) Most of the food is CHEAP, you'll pay a similar price for your craft cocktail as you will for your food. Amazing!   A few tips at Tip Top: This place is cash only but there is an ATM inside.  There is a smoking and non-smoking section outside, be sure to choose according to your taste.  The patio closes before the rest of the bar. (10 pm, I think?)"}
{"text":"One of our favorites & glad to have it in the neighborhood. The fried pickles are my favorite & I love the changing tap beer selection. The patio is also nice for brunch in the summer."}
{"text":"Love!   We will be back, and back often.  As our summer Saturday dining trek continues this is the epitome of what we want.  A local joint, that just makes you comfortable and glad to be out.  Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday, and found our way to the new back patio.  A couple of larger groups, but plenty of choice of seating.  Found our table, and service was immediate-friendly, attentive, and just exceptional.  KR had barely ordered and couldn't stop gushing about her love of this place.   We started with the fried pickles, based on previous reviews, and they were perfectly done. KR had the Rooster sandwich and enjoyed it so much, she only offered me a tiny bite, As I'm unable to order the same, I was forced to the Tip Top burger, and was not disappointed.  Perfectly done, and flavor throughout. After another beverage, and just enjoying the evening, we got our check and headed out. Thanks to other reviews, we knew CASH only, but there is an ATm, so heads up!  Perfect, exactly what we wanted, and this sets the bar for us for the balance of our summer Saturday dining trek."}
{"text":"When I buy a house, I want to live next to a place like Tip Top Tavern. I'm not sure how long ago it re-opened, but they did an unbelievable job. It's cozy and has some up-north flair, while rooted in modern cuisine, unique beer selection, and delicious cocktails.  We love coming here for FRIDAY FISH FRY - one of the best in Madison. It gets a little busy,  but the friendly bartenders (Hi, Justin) will welcome you at the bar. We just had lunch on the large patio and started exploring more of the menu. Cheese curds? Salsa Verde Carnitas? Fried Pickles? Classic sandwich menu? Check, check, check, check. And everything tastes great.  The prices are very fair, but bring cash, because it's one of those \"cash-only\" places."}
{"text":"Got there at about 130 pm on a Sunday. Not very busy.  Retrieved our own waters and was told to sit wherever outside and that someone would be with us. Waited quite a while as a waitress buzzed past us (we were right In the middle of the beer garden in plain sight). Retrieved our own menus from inside then still 10 minutes later no waitress, nor even a hello from her as she passed by. We left after that. Food smelled good though?"}
{"text":"The food is a cut above most bars. I don't give many reviews, but I needed to give my favorite place one.   Not sure if you want breakfast or lunch?  Have the rooster. It's basically a BLT with 2 fried eggs on a grilled cheese sandwich. What more could you want!?  The burgers are made with very high quality meat, and the bun is soft without falling apart. They're also doing a nice Fish Fry on Fridays.  The place looks great. If you were ever in before the renovation, it's hard to believe your in the same bar. I really thought they took down a wall or something. I've found the staff friendly and have had many fun conversations at the bar."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with a friend before the snow storm hits.    I ordered the Tip Top Burger w/ a side of cheese curds-it was excellent, and served quickly.  Bar tender was friendly, tap selection was small but had some great options.  Definitely will be going back!   Cash only."}
{"text":"So, let me preface this by saying that this was our first and only trip to this place (also my first ever negative review).  My girlfriend wanted to go to the Black Sheep Bazaar they were having, so I checked on their yelp to see if they were dog friendly (according to their yelp they are), but upon arriving we noticed a sign that read \"no dogs allowed\".  Puzzled, I went inside and approached the bartender to ask if they were in fact dog friendly.  Without so much as making eye contact with me, the guy says very flatly 'no'.  I'm not one to base my opinion of a place on one experience, and we plan to give it another shot at some point, but this was definitely not the best first impression."}
{"text":"This is, quite frankly, often the happiest place in the World.  People are really friggen nice.  If you have a shitty attitude, leave it at the door, and order up a stiff drink and some good food.  The servers act like family, work well together, and want you to be taken care of.  The food wait is sometimes a little too long, but worth it.  The specials usually nail it.  I almost gave it one star so it doesn't become too crowded.  Almost."}
{"text":"Amazing. Such a delish fish fry. The cod is beyond perfect. The atmosphere is unique and cute; an amazing outdoor area. You can't go wrong coming here for drinks and dinner! Very reasonably priced as well!!"}
{"text":"My second time back, the service was terrible. After we ordered, the waitress informed us that the kitchen was backed up and it would be an hour for our food. But, she was willing to give us some complimentary soup if we were willing to wait. Sure, why not. We were on the patio and it was a nice night out. Except that the wait for food stretched to more than 1 1/2 hours and in the last half hour, we watched people who sat down after us get their food before us. Frustration was mounting by the time our food showed up.   My sister went with some friends on a separate night. They sat down and then waited for someone to greet them and take their order. All the while, they watched waitress after waitress stop at the table next to them and never bothering to stop at their table or even make eye contact with them.  The wait staff couldn't get their act together enough to figure out who was in charge of which table and who had been helped."}
{"text":"Have had lunch at Tip Top Tavern two or three times in the last six months.... Always great food!  Staff is attentive and friendly, too.   Good place to \"pop in\" for good food."}
{"text":"Visited Tip Top Tavern on a Sunday morning and got to indulge in some delicious brunch! We got the Rooster (tasty breakfast sandwich with bacon jutting out every which way) and the Bourbon-glazed Ham Benedict (slight sweetness to a classic breakfast dish). Both were delicious and fair priced. Self serve coffee was an added bonus. It's also family friendly with a surprising amount of sitting room once you take into account the patio and hidden backroom.  We'll be sure to check out the tavern for evening festivities in the near future!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome fish fry here. Went to two other places before stopping here because they both had long waits and we were glad we stopped here! We were greeted immediately and the host was super nice and accommodating. Bar service was good. Fish was awesome, one of us got the fried cod other the baked walleye, bother were cooked perfectly. Only thing we didn't really like was the coleslaw, just wasn't our favorite. Everything else was great!  Definitely get the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Came in for a fish fry last Friday night. The place was busy, there seemed to be a short wait for tables. Luckily two people had just gotten up from the bar so we were able to snag 2 bar seats without waiting. And boy, were we lucky, because the bartenders here are FANTASTIC. Incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, they make great traditional Brandy Old Fashioneds. They also have some of their own infusions that they do, like a honey chai infused bourbon (also great as the base of an old fashioned).   The food came out relatively quickly. It is a pretty standard fish fry menu. You can have either Cod or Walleye, breaded or fried. I had the fried cod, and it was definitely worth the trip to the near east side. Light, not overpowering batter, and thick pieces of cod. Fries were pretty standard, but the house-made cole slaw was a nice touch as well.   All in all, classic Wisconsin Fish Fry experience. Really cool little place, great staff, good food, and great drinks. They also told me they are opening a Speakeasy right next door, which is really exciting. They do a lot of their own infusions so I can't wait to see what drinks they come up with for this new venture.   Not quite sure it was good enough to unseat Quivey's Grove at the \"Tip Top\" of my fish fry list, but it came darn close (horrible joke free of charge)."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe-its an old school dive bar, still popular with the 60-something locals but it's been remade as a hipster hangout serving artisan cocktails, craft beers and food.  We stopped in on a Monday night on our way to the airport for a bite to eat.  The wood paneling and multicolored tile floor give it a warm soothing feel.  We were invited to sit anywhere and ordered some beers and drinks from their inventive menu along with some chicken strips, a gourmet grilled cheese, and the nightly special pulled pork sandwich.  Service was a bit slow but the food arrived hot and was quite good as were the drinks.  It's not a bit place so I imagine it can get a bit crowded in the weekend.  Perfect for those craving authentic and reasonably priced food and drink.  NOTE: this place is CASH ONLY SO PLAN AHEAD.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Favorite place for Sunday brunch! Great coffee and Bloody Mary's, fantastic food especially the Eggs Benedict! Wait staff is super, attentive and friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As I write this, my ears are still ringing from the decibel onslaught that Tip Top delivered.  It was so bad that a couple left before ordering.  Adding some soft elements to either the walls or ceiling would help remedy this. The tavern has a solid beer list and from the reviews, a menu that most people enjoy.  I was not one of those people.  Craving some comfort food from a long weekend, I opted for the Green Chili Mac and Cheese while my girlfriend went with Pastrami King.  The mac and cheese promised roasted poblano peppers and jalapenos but I wouldn't have guessed that by what I tasted.  Not that creamy and definitely not the peppery overtones that I was expecting.  A very normal and bland dish.  My girlfriend's sandwich fared a bit better.  The pastrami was delicious and well smoked but it's companions on the bread (sharp cheddar, horseradish mayo, lettuce, tomato, and red onion) was poorly constructed and was sloppy to eat.   For me, not a destination spot.  If I was in the neighborhood, perhaps, but I think there are better options a few minutes away."}
{"text":"Awesome fish fry on Friday. Great weekend brunch. Cash only but ATM on-site. Al makes a wicked bloody Mary at brunch."}
{"text":"Bar looks great and seems like an excellent addition to Madison's east side. Service was quick and responsive. The items off the regular menu were fine. I had the Seitan Philly (no cheese) and my sister-in-law the Tuna So Gouda. It was the special that was a total dud. My wife and brother both ordered the taco special, which they said was exceptionally bland. Unlike me, neither is inclined to tell the waitstaff that their food was blah when asked. The beer selection was excellent. I think they are on the right track, but need to find someone who will give them better feedback on new ideas for food. We will definitely come again, but not if we plan to have a pleasant conversation -- very, very loud with the tin ceiling (it looks great though)."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. The Caramel cake here tonight. Looked so unassuming. Was So AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch; this is what I wanted the new Avenu to be, fresh food at a decent price.   I got the scramble, it was excellent. The toast tasted home made, and I'm quite confidant the cheesy potatoes came into the restaurant as whole potatoes that had to be prepared, as opposed to potatoes pre cut and pre cooked as a heat and eat dump out of the bag thing. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"To be accurate, this review should rank between 2 and 3 stars.  After several visits to this new entry to Madison's self actualized near east side, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that certain aspects of this loud but well meaning neighborhood bar are worth repeating as a customer, while others are not.  The bad news is that, those aspects not worth repeating happen at unexpected and seemingly random intervals.  Most recently, I visited with a fellow burger aficionado (I had based my enthusiastic expectations on my previous visit). Sadly, those expectations were dashed on this occasion, as the staff was clearly in over their head in handling the large overflow of customers.  After seeing no food for ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES, we were extended several complimentary drinks from the bar.  The burger itself, was more pedestrian than I remembered (my friend was not especially impressed).  It must be made clear at this point that the menu is broad and worth exploring, but the most recent experience caused me to realize that until they are able to handle their weekend crush, a lower priority weeknight will likely be when I next visit, which I will review as an update."}
{"text":"I am so glad I live within walking distance to this place!  I am never disappointed, and always leave happy.  Service is great, and the Veggie Melt is hands-down my favorite sandwich in Madison.  Their beer list is also impressive!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!  Friendly bartender and waitstaff- cozy environment.  The food is different than typical bar food, in a great way!!!  We had the special of the day which was a blue gill sandwich with fresh coleslaw on it- it was excellent.  It's going to be our new date night spot!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Tip Top yesterday evening with some coworkers to finally check it out. I've been curious since renovations began and was expecting great things. After a late shift, we were there for drinks and light food. The place was bustling, and yes noisy, yet we could still have a conversation without straining at a table near the back wall - so don't be afraid to bring a friend here if you actually want to chat. Selection was great and everything that we ordered (and actually received) was excellent. The fried pickles are crispy, delicious, and done right.  However after waiting a half hour for an order of chicken wings, we were able to grab our server's attention and ask about my wings. \"Oops,\" she said. And then a not very satisfying apology. Having already waited a half hour, we were wrapping our night up and I said, \"Let's forget them\" since she was offering any solutions.   Somewhere between ordering the wings and realizing we wouldn't get them, our server told us she was taking off for the night and asked us to settle up with her. Our bill was completely off. You could say the free beers offset the lost order but it definitely wasn't intentional since the bill came first.  I have high expectations of customer service and Tip Top Tavern failed, which is too bad because I was really beginning to like the place."}
{"text":"Really great drinks, love that they do their own infusions. This bar has a funky, homey vibe, and I will definitely be back - especially to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to the Tip Top for the first time last Sunday eve. Three of us. Ate inside cause it was hot. Partner had the veggie burger, and said it was the best she had had in Madison. BFF had a burger and fries. Voted very tasty. Sorry, don't remember which one. And I had the BLT but with just one slice o bread cause that's how I 'roll' . I loved it. I also had my one drink for the year, the Pear o D something. Smooth and smoky! I wasn't driving. Our server was great, friendly, a little slow on bringing the bill, but all was fine. As I told Partner, this will become my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Soooo happy to report that our most recent visit, around Christmas time, was a pure delight. Our waitress, Rachel, was a gem, the service was fast, and the food perfection itself. YAY! W00t!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit to Tip Top on a Friday night for a fish fry. The interior is very welcoming and reminiscent of other restaurants in the group (think Mickey's or Lazy Jane's). We got one of the last available tables around 5:30 (party of two).  Ordered brandy old fashioneds and fish fry (cod for me and walleye for my friend). Food was delish (except the coleslaw). I splurged for the loaded baked potato but would go with fries next time - not special enough for a $2 upcharge. Service was friendly, efficient, and quick.  I heard talk of a dessert menu. I was intrigued but passed.  Would also visit in the summer to enjoy a lovely patio.   Cash only."}
{"text":"Had great expectations when stopping in for fish fry on Friday night.  Found a seat at the bar and ordered walleye with a baked potato.  Started to go through my emails and just a few minutes later my food shows up.  Seeing the befuddled look on my face, the bartender explains that for some reason they had a cancelled or screwed up order sitting there that matched my order, so I'm in luck!.  The meal was adequate, for the most part.  Single piece of fish was a bit overdone (not sure how long it was sitting around, or if it was reheated), potato was unremarkable, and I am personally not a fan of the slaw, bit too tart for my taste.  Staff was friendly, and I can live with the cash only policy.  All of this was acceptable, until I got the bill.  I'm not sure if the fish fry is all you can eat, but I think I paid all you can eat prices.  I assume this was because I ordered the walleye without looking at the menu, but I just didn't expect to pay so much for a single piece of fish and a potato.  Hoping to stop by for brunch and looking forward to what I hope will be a much better experience.  And next time I will get the cod, and look at the menu first!"}
{"text":"Came for a casual after work meal on Thursday night and guess what? The burgers and fries were served hot. Sadly this has not been the case at other local establishments (see my reviews). The prices are right for this dive-bar-turned-gentrified-hippie bar, $9-10 on average for sandwich/burger and fries. We sat at the bar, got good service. Their signature cocktail, a martini-like drink, wasn't for me but their old fashioned, made with ginger beer, sounds interesting. The ambiance is pleasant and fairly quiet, easy to carry on a conversation.  Service was good. We will return for our next burger fix!"}
{"text":"Tip Top Food. Tip Top Drink. Tip Top Tavern!   While the cash only thing is sort of a drag, their beer line-up is not. Easily one of the best pumpkin beers I've had, spicy, with notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, not sweet. I'll head back and grab the name then update this, as it escapes me.   The build your own burger is super solid, a la Five Guys in that it's one set price and you can add a bajillion toppings. Premium items like avocado are a little extra, but totally worth it when you consider the burger itself loaded with standards comes in at around 8 bucks.   I agree with a few others who say the noise level can be hard to tolerate, but two people sitting at the bar or a table will be a-ok. Perhaps a larger group might have trouble hearing each other, but the space is quaint and intimate, I'm not sure you'd want to give it a go if your party is larger than 4."}
{"text":"Food and service can't be beat at Tip Top!  I hosted a group, and they were happy to have notice so they could get tables together and prepare the waitstaff.  It's a small dinning room, but they have an outdoor seating area that's wonderful in the summer.  The music on a Sunday morning was soft Motown, and they were kind enough to find the 1 coffee carafe in the whole place and give it to our table.  I have never had a bad meal, and everyone agreed that the food was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try something other than breakfast.  *Note that they do not separate checks for tables over 4, and I think they only take cash."}
{"text":"Went again at the behest of a friend. Again: SLOW, rude service. It took almost 45 minutes to even order..! The manager(?) not only stared at us while we were eating, but imitated my friend's laugh--we both heard him do it and were, \"WTF?\"--and just hovered at the end of the bar being creepy. The cheeseburger I had was overpriced and not worth what I paid at all. The bartender's ego was put on display prominently. What a sight. With all that glad-handing and posturing it's a wonder any drinks were made at all. There was so much smug in there we could barely breathe. Buncha smarmy d00dz dressed like lumberjacks and some local drunks."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late meal on a Thursday night and the place was quite lively, but there were still a few tables open.  The servers all seemed to be having a good time and took excellent care of us, checking in just enough but not too much.    The menu is small, but has something for everyone.  We tried the carnitas - flavorful and tender - and a burger - expertly seasoned and juicy.  Both were slightly overcooked: the burger arrived more medium rare than the requested rare, and on the carnitas the yolk of one fried egg was deliciously soft, while the other was just a bit too set.  However the high quality ingredients and delightful flavors evened out any imperfections.  The drink menu was well rounded and we enjoyed both the beer and cocktails.    The small touches in design elevate the interior from the ordinary in an entirely pleasing way.  Tip Top is a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to enjoying it again soon."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night.   Cozy is the first word that comes to mind.  The food we tried was a mixed bag.  Sweet potato fries were waffle-style, and not very sweet potato-ey.  The fried pickles had a nice spicy kick, and the Green Chili Mac & Cheese hit the spot.  Savory, creamy and spicy.  About a dozen great beers on tap, and nicely-priced and delicious cocktails.  But I think I'd still rather just go to Mickey's!"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for lunch yesterday and had a very pleasant experience.  The interior has been beautifully re-done with a gorgeous wood bar and the overall atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.  There were only a couple of other customers at the time, so we had no problem finding a table.  Service was slightly slow I suppose, considering how empty the place was, but that wasn't an issue for us as we really had nowhere else to be on a winter Saturday afternoon.   Both the fried pickles and cheese curds were delicious- very easy to fill up on just those before you ever get to your meal.  The mac and cheese was decent (husband loved it), though I felt like the cheese itself was a little bland (like it needed a stronger cheese, or could have been a little creamier maybe?). I also wish it came with maybe a side salad or something. The Tuna So Gouda was pretty tasty and was a nice twist on your basic tuna sandwich.  The only issue for me was that no one came to refill our water glasses until the end of the meal (and the glasses are very small, so you finish your water pretty quickly), so you may want to ask for a larger glass right from the start.   Overall, the food was good and the prices were very reasonable.  It is cash-only so make sure you have some on hand when you go there. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks.  Hipster as all hell though...  Biggest issue is the owner.  Guy is a tool to say the least.  Talks all nice like he is your best friend and then turns around and says to the closet person how much he can't stand whoever it was he was taking to.  Just as fake a person as ever.  I don't go there on principle of the fact that I won't give money to anyone like that."}
{"text":"Came for an outing here for the first time with friends who live in the neighborhood.  The bar inside is nice.  It is everything I picture for a local neighborhood spot.  There is a great outdoor patio space with lots of room for groups.  We had the patio almost to ourselves at 6 pm on a Tuesday in July but it filled up as we were leaving.  My friends has the special (Tacos with Mole sauce).  They liked it very much.  I had The Rooster egg sandwich.  It was so good.  I love that a side salad comes with the sandwich, also with a side of chips or upgrade to fries, onion rings, cheese curds, pickles, or soup of the day.  My friends ended the meal with the cake of the day.  It was a Salted Caramel Cake.  I did take a bite and liked it.  I was trying to be good so I avoided more than a few bites.  I will want to come here again to try more things off the menu and to try the brunch too.  I have heard good things about that brunch.  To note:  Parking lot is for three or four cars. But there was ample street parking on the Tuesday evening.  Weekend may be busier but worth a walk/bike in."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the neighborhood. This past Saturday my mom and sister were over to help with some much needed yard work so we took them to the Tip Top for dinner as a thank you. There was a funky yard sale type event happening on their patio that we checked out while waiting for our food. I had the Vedge burger, it was one of the best (if not the best) veggie burger I've ever had. My sister had the gourmet grilled cheese which came with tomato, avocado and pesto...and will probably be what I get on my next visit, it was so awesome. My mom's and husband's sandwiches were equally amazing. The decor and clientele are laid back and funky. With this place being just a stones throw away from our new digs I can definitely see the Tip Top being our go-to neighborhood joint for a great sandwich or relaxing cocktail or beer."}
{"text":"Man, Madison is getting so many great new places that it is hard for me to keep track!   The Tip Top Tavern is one of those spots I always drove by and thought \"Man, what a dive. I bet It's great\", but never got around to visiting. So, when I found out they had opened back up with a new owner, a food menu, and a new look I decided I had better get over there.   Seriously, folks - what a great little place.   After a bit of a rough start where-in I ordered a beer that I couldn't even look at because it was so awful  (the Dogfish Head T'weason Ale - what a disaster of a beer. They were super cool and replaced it with their house old-fashioned, which was one of the best takes on the cocktail I have ever had) the meal went really smooth - especially considering how crazy busy it was.  Between the three of us we ordered 2 burgers, cheese curds, and the fish fry special. The burger was delicious, moist, and cooked extremely well. The coleslaw was tasty, but had way too much vinegar. The fries were crispy and free of excess oil which was nice. Apparently the fish was delicious as well. Finally - the curds. Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch. Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side. These are the closest to perfection I have ever had. Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!  Beyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space. The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer.  I feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings."}
{"text":"I never set foot in the old Tip Top so couldn't attest to the transformation which I hear is remarkable.  What I can say is this is my favorite all-around bar. Justin is a good down to earth guy. Even when it's busy he takes time to talk and makes custom drinks. I can definitely say Tip Top has the best mixed drinks in town. Add the tasteful decor and the decent pub food and this is one of the best neighborhood/dive bars in Madison."}
{"text":"Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order.   Finally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!"}
{"text":"I used to think Hop Cat was the best place in Madison to get a burger but I may be wrong. Tip Top is a small, unassuming building on Commercial Avenue, on Madison's underestimated Northside. Service is fast and prompt. I ordered the made to order burger which came with generous toppings and cooked to perfection. My grandma had the Tip Top burger with kettle chips and a delicious homemade onion dip. I had a side of cheese curds that were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and paired well with the onion dip. If you're looking for a cheap place to grab a satisfying burger and a local beer, I  highly recommend this place. I'll be back for sure sometime soon."}
{"text":"Casual bar setting with unique and gorgeous decor sprinkled inside when you look around. I've always been welcomed with a smile and great service. The food is awesome, great beer list? and a patio for summertime! Love this spot. Never been for brunch, but sounds top notch!"}
{"text":"I liked the slightly divey, hipster-ey feel of the Tip Top. Seating, decor--it was all good.   I wasn't particularly wild about the menu or what I ordered, though. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just nothing special. I had the carnitas with eggs and corn tortillas. It was decent.  I would have appreciated some salsa or a drizzle of sour cream to go along with it.  Maybe some avocado? All that was available was a small bottle of candied jalapeño sauce.  Which was decent, but didn't add much to the mix, which was kind of lacking in flavor.  My partner had the granola with yogurt and fruit, and it looked amazing. The granola was very obviously homemade, and it smelled great. It most have also tasted great, because his bowl was clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my Daughter.  We had a great time.  Good food and the service was wonderful.  The remodel is very well done.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner here yesterday. It'd been a while, but the Tip-Top came to mind--the husband is a notorious thought-stealer, just for the record. I'm sure he'll claim otherwise. Anyway, we both love this place. It's very welcoming and comfortable. They have a fine beer list and a full bar. The service has always been great, no matter who is serving the table. We love the friendly vibe of the place. The menu hasn't changed since our first visit, but the quality hasn't either. These folks know how to cook some tasty food, and they seem bent on continuing to do so while also serving you great beers or fine cocktails. They have the best onion rings ever as a starter. Try the vedge burger. If I'm not getting that, I'm ordering the green chile mac 'n' cheese. I admit to taking leftovers home and using them as an ingredient when I cook dinner the next night. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"What a experience!! We met the owner and friends and it was on from there! Great food drink atmosphere man if you want a good time with people who have the same thinking as you this is the place! Will definitely come back!!"}
