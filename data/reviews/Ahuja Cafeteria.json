{"text":"It's typical hospital cafeteria food, but where are all the workers?? I can't seem to find anyone to ring me up or help me get the hot food behind the glass. It's clearly open and the food is sitting there, but there is nobody in sight. I almost just took my fries and walked out. Then, I finally flag down someone working and ask where I need to pay and they look at me like I just ruined their morning. If the food was excellent then it'd *maybe* make up for the invisible workers, but it's not. There's a chipotle a few blocks away, just take your money and go there instead."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but I feel the need to update my review with a lower rating.  Most of the things that I like best - unique, healthy entrees with posted nutritional information are gone.  I am not sure why.  The sandwich, pizza and fast food areas still have them, but not the entrees.  Also, it seems like many areas are less well stocked.  I have no idea why this has changed for the worse,  making it no different than most other hospital cafeteria."}
{"text":"I have worked at this hospital over 5 years and have always had issues with this cafeteria's service. The workers here are experts at ignoring customers, including staff and visitors alike. They also put away the majority of their food 15-20 minutes early so if you get busy on 2nd shift saving lives and can't race to the basement by 6pm then you are out of luck. I have emailed the manager in the past who only responded after my boss mentioned it to him. I would give only 1 star but the food is actually pretty good. Too bad no one there wants to serve it."}
{"text":"So I went in because I felt like I had strep. It took 20 minutes for us to get called which is unusual for this particular hospital. Once we got in the room, 2 pushy uneducated 'nurses' came in trying to eagerly shove some stick down my throat, which I know is necessary but they were just instantly agressive and just rude. Not to mention we could hear them talking about us in the hallway calling me and my twin sister thing 1 and thing 2 before they even knew us. I was so surprised because my experiece with Ahuja is always very good. But not this time. Those two fake nurses should be fired."}
{"text":"We had to come here Easter morning for something to eat before visiting our grandmother in the hospital. The food was actually really good and we were grateful for the Easter-themed items such as real ham. The facility as a whole is gorgeous and very clean. The employees have been very kind and patient."}
