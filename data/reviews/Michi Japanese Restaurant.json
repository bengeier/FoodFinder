{"text":"a very cute and cozy Japanese Restaurant. Great sushi. it is open in the summer of 2009 i think. love their Michi crunchy roll. the food presentation is great too.. not so pricey."}
{"text":"How can I be the first to review, this place has been around for three years!  Food and service are all around good.  Lunch specials are good deals, you can add extra things like tempura for a small charge.  Dynamite (tempura shrimp) handrolls are deelish.  The lunch bento boxes are a great value.    My coworkers and I once experienced \"bad\" sashimi (salmon had gone fishy...GROSS).  When we told them, they actually gave us a $50 gift card for the trouble!  And they gave us a plate of fresh salmon sashimi.  I think they were embarrassed by the situation, but it's rare to find a restaurant these days that has so much integrity.  I've been to places where they don't give a crap if you find a hair or bug or rotten food.  But obviously, this place does give a crap.  Good on them."}
{"text":"Wow !! If you love Japanese food, this is the place. Unlike many other Japanese restaurants in this area, Michi has a Japanese chef and their food is done RIGHT! This restaurant has a beautiful interior and has the atmosphere of a fine dining restaurant. The servers are polite and the service is great. I don't think it has been open for too long but I've become a regular already. I have to have my weekly dose of their signature \"Michi Crunch\" roll and their fish is soooo fresh! This place makes other Japanese restaurants look like fast food stands. You've gotta try it to believe!"}
