{"text":"This was our first visit to Tea Space and we were very pleased. The service is prompt, friendly and extremely helpful. Teas are of high quality and very tasty, not to mention very reasonably priced. We all had the honey boba which was flavorful and everything a honey boba pearl should be, with the exception of being a bit on the crunchy side. I had the Iced Soy Milk Pudding, Sea Salt Latte, Brown Sugar, Hot Honey Boba and it was still under $5 with all the additions. We will return!"}
{"text":"Love the interior and vibe of the place. Came with friends, and we tried the kumquat black tea, peach green milk tea, and ice milk with egg pudding and honey boba. They all tasted great! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am pretty lay when it comes to 'good boba'. That being said, this place wins as my favorite spot.  There are three important aspects to this establishment: atmosphere, service, and taste.  The atmosphere was very quaint, and even as someone who generally doesn't care about the look of the place I'm eating at, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor.  The service was very timely (especially considering there was only one person making drinks). My only qualm was the cashier couldn't figure out how to print a receipt, but in no way did that detract from my overall experience here.  The taste was something else. I ordered a caramel milk tea with boba, and I wholeheartedly expected some overly sweet creation as I had in the past from other tea bars. Instead, the flavor was balanced. It wasn't overly sweet nor was it overly bitter. The boba was so fresh that it was still hot, and the texture was uniform and slightly chewy.   In the end, this place was a treat for me because I usually have to settle for sub-par boba that is near my home. I surely plan on returning next time I'm near this part of town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to try out some drinks after we heard good things about it. It's a quiet little place with a nice atmosphere. We were greeted accordingly and immediately given menus. My boyfriend loves cats so he loved their little theme going on.  We had an almond coffee milk tea with boba, regular size. Their regular size is pretty large so we shared a drink. It adds only $.99 on to your charge to get a regular size so id recommend getting it, to make the most of your visit. The drink itself was pretty good. I tasted more coffee than the teeniest hint of almond though. The boba was nice and squishy.   We ordered a wintermelon milk tea afterwards, only small sized with boba just to try it out. This drink is my boyfriends usual at other places, and he thought this one was great too! It had a really strong wintermelon flavor and a bit milkier than other places but in a good way. It was a little sweet though even for my sweet tooth.  The service was wonderful though. We were offered any adjustments if we wanted and were asked more than once if things were good. Since this place is new, I say it has a lot of potential. Keep it up ~"}
{"text":"Boba.  Boba.  Boba.  An LA native that visits Vegas too often than most.  When I come to Vegas, I need some boba.  I've tried the next door places, kung fu and all, and this place is WAY better.  Not crowded, good boba (it is a boba place afterall) and friendly, super nice service.  It does not get any better.  Sizes are great, reasonable prices, ample parking, and cute funny cats on the wall.  There is even a random green balloon on the wall.    Will definitely come back for sure"}
{"text":"Yes. Indeed. It's one of those hole-in-the-wall precious places you only tell your friends about since you don't want the line out the door kind of selfish thing. But then again I am yelping about it. Both the food and drinks are authentic and made with time and care. (This is not a speedy place if you want efficiency) It's a layback place where you are invited to play cards or board games and imagine you are back in a small town in Asia. The boba surpasses any spot in town and absolutely worth the wait. All the rice dishes are just as delicious and true to the traditional setups as in Asia. The stew pork rice is almost as good as grandma's! Only bring your family, good friends and slow time."}
{"text":"Our server Derrick was very attentive and gave us a great recommendation on drinks! Food was really good too and not super pricey."}
{"text":"The milk teas are on point. I always get the wintermelon milk tea with honey boba and or seasalt wintermelon honey boba soo good better than kung fu teas lol! Much bigger too"}
{"text":"Best boba I've ever had ! Worst taro milk tea I've ever had... The taro flavoring is so super weak which is super disappointing, especially since taro has such a distinct taste. I really could have just order a regular milk tea and it would have been the same. However, their boba is so sweet, chewy and delicious. That helped them earn some points. And their regular size is really big. Larger than some places large size."}
{"text":"After a year of exploration I think we've finally found our home away from home !! The menu is straightforward and not overbearing, short and sweet- they don't allow for a lot of bend with their drinks which some people might not appreciate, but no biggie ~   The almond tea here is like no other- better and more UMPH !!!!!!! then all the other places around.The flavors are extremely fragrant and strong (just how I like it) and it's very memorable. The Boba is soft !! What more can a girl ask for ?   The music and atmosphere are perfect, service is fast. The employees were nice and great and everyone there was obviously having a good time which is such a great tell tell sign that the place is a keeper !  Fun place to hangout on a cold night and play an odd mind game about cats with your friends - Oh ! And not to mention the cute interior. If you make one spot in vegas for tea, make sure it's here !"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect little tea shop when you have a craving for boba. It's not super busy so it's easy to find parking, not like Kung Fu Tea or Tea Station. Can get in and out quickly. Boba milk tea is good and my favorite, passion fruit green tea with mango jelly is wonderfully delicious and refreshing. This place also have little snacks too like TeaStation, haven't tried the snacks but would like to next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! It's a little pricey but the \"regular\" size is more like an XL so it compensates for the price difference. I really like the okinawa coffee with sea cream and especially the wintemelon fresh milk tea with grass jelly. I've tried it with and without the fresh milk, and the fresh milk makes it SOOO much better! The grass jelly is also really good! I had a craving for grass jelly and this place definitely hits the spot.  As for the food, I've only tried the popcorn chicken. When I first ordered it, I thought it was a little pricey but its well worth it. The portion size is good, and the pieces were sized just right with the right amount of flavor and crispiness.  I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mango Yogurt drink is so freaking good! I will most definitely have this drink once a day! I appreciate gentleman letting me know that the Boba is actually fresh without any added chemicals! Got yourself a regular customer! Service was sooo pleasant!"}
{"text":"The place is definitely one of me favorite place in LV now. The staffs are very nice and friendly. I tried the most popular house milk tea. It was really good, high quality drink. The day after, I came back to try their small hot pot and the original milk blended drink. I felt the soy soup was taste too plain, but the drink was very good. Both I and my boyfriend love the place and also their cute cat decorations."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, nice staff, cool people to chat with always friendly & helpful. Great food & teas and slushes. Whenever I get a hankering for a cold rink especially during the summer this is the place to go. Friendly, nice owners too. Check it out for sure"}
{"text":"Their boba is really yummy! There's only so many boba places in town that actually have good boba. The drinks aren't super sweet either which I'm a fan of. I love their fresh milk teas and since I'm lactose intolerant, I'm really glad that they have soy milk as an alternative to the whole milk. The place is really cute and the atmosphere/service is great."}
{"text":"Friendly and inviting vibe. Service is top-notch. Some of their drink are perhaps a bit sweet for my tastes but my favorite is the lavender milk tea. I ahven't tried any of their snacks but they looked good as well."}
{"text":"This place has good service and has good drinks like the passion fruit green tea. I would recommend it to to anybody that like tea."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff!  My husband had the taro iced soy milk with honey boba, the taro is fresh and homemade, ask for it blended so it's like a smoothie, YUM-YUM!  I had the pudding iced milk with honey boba, good stuff!  No long line like kung-fu tea, with a lovely  quaint atmosphere. This is my new spot!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best smoothies I've had. Not too sweet and not too bland, the boba was perfectly sweetened as well. I'll be coming here every time I visit!"}
{"text":"We just visited this place for the first time and our first impressions were very positive. The walls are lined cute little cat drawings . We had a big party of 12 and they immediately moved tables around to accommodate us. The teas were great and the staff was very friendly. We enjoyed our visit and will return again."}
{"text":"I think we found our new boba spot in Vegas :) The husband and I decided to take our kids here after our first visit and my kids la la love their boba drinks! My 14 year loves their boba. The taste and texture is one of the best he's had. I myself like my drinks without the boba but when I took a taste, he wasn't kidding, I totally agree. The boba was soft but not too soft but with a nice chew. It wasn't hard in the middle like other boba spots we've had.   We highly recommend trying their mango lemonade. The sweet and tanginess was just perfect. Their wintermelon milk tea was good too but definitely on the sweeter side.  All in all, we would definitely recommend this spot if you're craving for some yummy drinks and boba"}
{"text":"A nice place for those looking for a quirky place to work or hang out. Pop music and cutesy, anime-ish art of cats and other generally cute things adorn the walls. Nice staff. The bubble teas are solid and decent. There are more outstanding bubble teas in Las Vegas, but if you are looking for a fun place to hang out while you sip on that boba this is a good choice. Unfortunately underwhelmed by their toast - not toasted enough (no browning or toast marks at all) and insufficient toppings/sauce for +$3. Did not try their other food items. Teens and twenty-somethings would probably really like this place."}
{"text":"Yay for Honey Boba! I've been here a few times now. There's never much of a wait. The service is quick and they'll adjust your drinks if needed. I really wish they had the plastic sheets like other boba places. They use a soda cap for their cups, so I cant turn the up upside down to shake it.   The almond milk tea is pretty good, a bit on the sweet side. The other flavored drinks aren't as sweet.   Overall its a contender for Boba. Definitely on par with Kung Fu Tea and Tea Station. It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Super cute little place! Love the atmosphere, plus the servers are incredibly sweet and make sure you're satisfied with your beverage or they will remake it to your liking. My almond tea was perfect, I'm so happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Spill my drink all over, not good especially for kid.  They need to update to sealed cup type."}
{"text":"Very cute deco, a full wall of cat photos for cat lovers to enjoy. Ordered their no.1 bestseller. Tea was a bit on the bitter side for me. I thought the add-ins (egg pudding and boba) were included since they are listed as part of the drink, but got charged extras. I would have added boba, but couldn't care less for the pudding. Their regular size cup is super huge though, made me full till dinner. My drink came out about $6."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite boba place in town! Coming from California, which has a plethora of boba shops, Tea Space meets my standards! Their boba is always at the right consistency and their prices aren't too shabby either. Their coffee boba is my go-to when I'm craving coffee and boba at the same time  The lights, art, and industrial design really give off a cozy, hip vibe which is perfect for studying!"}
{"text":"Great food, boba and love the Strawberry Green tea!  Tea Space and Team Members  always providing great service.  Joyce providing 5-Star excellence.  Wintermelon coffee recommended Marj-terrific choice.  Also, their hot pots are outstanding, along with my favorites-beef don, minced pork rice and pork chops.  Word is getting around about Tea Space-definitely competitive!"}
{"text":"Yummy flavor not too sweet. Small place but it's good for a grab and go boba. They also have rose boba which was cool. Price is good."}
{"text":"Tea Space has been chillin' in my bookmarks for a long time and I was finally able to try it one random summer night. I think I've found one of my fave boba places!  After a long night at UNLV, my fiancé and I started to crave boba. We drove to Chewy and was immediately heartbroken to see it closed. We almost went to Tea Time but we didn't wanna deal with bad customer service so we ended up here & thank goodness we did!  Tea Space is open late & this quaint little place has the friendliest workers. You walk in to a cute well-decorated place. They saw us struggling with choosing from their extensive menu and they were kind enough to give us their milk tea to try out. It was so good that my fiancé ordered himself a large. I wanted something fruity though so I decided on mango black tea with lychee pieces. We also ordered takoyaki cause.. why not.  They brought two super tall glasses of our drinks and takoyaki served on a little pan. So cute! The milk tea is not too sweet and we didn't adjust the sweetness so that's a good thing. It's creamy and the boba is chewy, but not too mushy. I loved my mango black tea too. It's bright, not bitter, very fruity and refreshing. The takoyaki was lightly drizzled with the sauce and topped with a lot of yummy bonito flakes.  Tea Space is definitely in my top 5 right now!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The popcorn chicken is so yummy, and delicious. It's cooked to perfection with the perfect seasoning. I was hoping the popcorn shrimp would taste just as good but the chicken is the winner! Love the theme inside, and every time we have stopped by it's been great service. I love drinking the Taro Smoothie with fresh Aloe Vera, and their regular size is humongous!"}
{"text":"First of all, I must warn that I am a cat lover so I am partial to all of the cat decorations there. 1000000 stars just for that!  Now, onto the tea. I was pretty excited to try some, especially since the owners seemed to make bubble tea the Taiwanese way (which is the most authentic). However, my jasmine milk tea was very watered down. I am not sure if it was a ratio issue or just my drink itself, as the tea was fragrant, just not \"bubble tea\" style. The pearls were chewy and fresh though, which was a big bonus.   Overall, I would go back again but I would order something else."}
{"text":"After a long drive to Vegas, my husband and I decided to get milk tea. We are milk tea lovers and wanted to try something new and this place pop up on yelp. I got the Hokkaido milk tea and my husband got the jasmine milk tea + popcorn chicken. Good tea but nothing special compare to the tea houses in California. I would come back but prefer get the jasmine milk tea and popcorn chicken. I didn't really care much for the Hokkaido milk tea. Popcorn chicken was in large chunks and very juicy with good seasoning. Friendly staffs and inviting atmosphere. Overall, I would come back!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty small and in a complex that don't look good.. but when u get inside it's Pretty cool.. 4-5 tables. I did the Rice pork chop and it's pretty good for 8.95 thats a lot. Also tried the mango tea with lychee really good. Also ordered the pop corn chicken was ok with some spicy powdered but not that spicy and even after a couple hours the pop chicken was still good. They have a decent amount of menu and prices is good they also have a small corner that sell some Korean snacks. They also have bottle that they sell at the counter and some paintings on the wall for sale. They also have stamp card if your like me that loves collecting stamp cards lol. Parking is small but bec of the stores near it not that busy."}
{"text":"The cashier was very kind and recommended a few things from the menu since it was my first time visiting Tea Space.   We ordered four drinks which included an almond milk tea (L $4.65), mango lychee smoothie (L $5.24), and two Hokkaido smoothies (S $4.25, L $5.24).   The Hokkaido smoothie was described to taste like the childhood favorite White Rabbit candy. But when I mixed my drink and took a sip...the White Rabbit flavor I knew and loved couldn't be distinguished. To me it tasted more like a burnt caramel. It still tasted good but was disappointed that it wasn't the flavor as advertised from the cashier. (3/5)  The mango lychee on the menu is said to only come in a smoothie form but when it was ready to be picked up it was clearly an iced tea. When ordering it was clear that a smoothie was the only option for this flavor combo so I was confused when this was the product served. The drink itself wasn't bad but again, the expected product was not delivered. (2/5)   The almond milk tea was good. It wasn't too sweet and went well with the honey boba. (3/5)  But on a more positive note, Tea Space by far has the best boba I've had in Vegas! I love that it is served warm with the drinks. It has the right amount of chewiness and sweetness to not send you into a sugar overload. The boba will have me coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this hole in the wall has the cutest decor. Cat painting and drawings all over and even the logo is that of a cute kitten.   The drinks, however, is a disaster. Since it was my first time here, I asked for recommendations. The guy pointed to the wall of their \"top 10\" items.   I asked about the winter melon fresh milk tea of which he tells me is delicious. He also suggested that I add sea salt latte on top: which sounded great! For toppings: I opt for the honey boba.   The drink itself was milky and had no tea flavor at all whatsoever. Since they were willing to make adjustments, I asked for extra tea, which I was then told that there was no tea in my WINTERMELON MILK TEA. That was a little misleading, calling your drink a milk tea when it doesn't have tea at all. They told me it was \"caffeine free\" -- which I then asked if I could change my drink.   Instead they recommended a wintermelon green tea sea salt latte - which again sounded great! Once the drink was remade, the boba was hot and it melted all the ice.   What I ABSOLUTELY HATED about this place was that the ice was tiny shaved ice. Every sip I took had ice chunks in my mouth which then diluted the drink itself. The green tea was a disappointment, with no tea flavor at all.. When asked how my drink was: I responded with \"it's ok....\" feeling bad to have them remake another. The worst part is: I ordered a regular size = 32oz. The drink cost $7.98 (with tip)... $8 is quite expensive for a drink I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Tea space is a great small business. They greet you with a smile and always willing to adjust your drink to your taste. They have great tea, great service, and probably the best boba in town. If more stars were available, I'd give them more."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, games, and a nice atmosphere. My main problem with the restaurant is that they charge you $5/person for sharing an entree. I understand charging a fee but $5 is ridiculous. Food is something people bond over and people shouldn't get charged for sharing."}
{"text":"Tea Space has the best boba in the area but the sweetest teas- but at least they're consistent with both. Cope by specifying less sweetness for your order and you should be good to go. Service is great, which is an anomaly for places that are adjacent to Spring Mountain Road.  Decor is cute with a cat theme, menu is pretty large, and the sizes are good for the price. For first time visitors, staff tend to recommend the house teas, which seem to be extra-sweet due to being made with half and half or cream? Unclear, but too sweet for me. They're great about adjusting or remaking drinks to fit your preference- the wintermelon beverages are refreshing in this ungodly summer heat.  Note that their signage is a bit faded and the storefront looks like it might be closed from the outside- it's in the same little building as the diabetic sweets bakery, and seems to have popped up overnight.  EDIT: Dropping a star. Service has been lacking the past couple of times I've been here. They're open late but manage to make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them if I pop in and interrupt their chat time as the only customer after 10PM."}
{"text":"Super cute place to drink some coffee and work on the computer. Went before showing some clients around, and I am glad I did. Excellent service and drinks."}
{"text":"Tea Space is a new boba shop right across the street from one of their biggest competitors, Kung Fu Tea. The outside of this establishment is kinda sketch and parking is limited. The drinks are okay. I've only tried the milk tea, milk green tea, wintermelon milk tea & honey milk tea. The boba is average and inconsistent. The first time I went, the boba was cooked perfectly. The second and third time was overcooked and mushy. The service is great and they're very friendly. They also have a cozy and comfy seating area with cute decor."}
{"text":"Cute little spot behind the church's chicken in Chinatown. Pretty good, but a little more expensive than other boba places. Got the pudding with honey boba and it was very good! At first I thought I thought it was going to be regular milk tea, but its like a milk slushy with hot honey boba and pudding in the bottom. You stir and it gets nice and warm. Very sweet and larger than most regular sizes. Sister got the green lemon iced tea no boba. Her's was ok. Unless your drink includes boba, its extra. They also have dairy free soy options. Overall, great service from the two guys working their and their honey boba is amazing!! Will come back soon"}
{"text":"I'm not from this area but I was craving some boba so I found this little gem on yelp and I couldn't be happier!!   Don't let the outside of the shop or area it's located in deter or discourage you from entering!!! The shop itself is a little smaller but it is cute and gives off a cozy vibe. My only complaint is that it gets a little crammed by the door since there's not much space in there.   I'm an avid Strawberry Green Tea drinker but I'm always hesitant on trying it since it's either a hit or miss with the flavor. Some shops tend to make it taste very perfume-like but this was not the case here! This place also has THE BEST tapioca balls I've ever had!!!! When I got the drink, it was warm at the bottom where the boba was at meaning it was freshly made! The boba had the perfect texture and was nicely sweet. Talk about ooey-gooey goodness.   Some other good drinks are the strawberry milk tea and taro milk tea!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tea Space way too many times now. I think it's great that they've added food items to their menu, but I have yet to try any. I still say their best drink is the ice milk drink (which they've given cute new names to them that I don't remember); it is also the only place that even offers this kind of boba drink that I've found in Vegas. Their boba is warm, chewy, and perfectly sweet.   The only tricksy thing about them is that a \"Teaspace small size\" is typically everyone else's regular; and a \"Teaspace regular size\" is typically everyone else's large.   Also, i do appreciate that they always offer you a menu, even though I already know what I want 99% of the time."}
{"text":"Pros:  1. Customer service is fantastic, Alan/Alvin (sorry if you're reading this, lol), he was friendly and let us sample the house milk tea, he ran down the menu for us and described all the popular drinks.   2. Milk tea, the house milk tea is good, it does taste fresh (not that powder stuff), also tried the hakaido milk tea, better than others I've tried.   3. Ambience, dim lit seating and real relaxed spa feeling. (Girlfriend did not like the cat paintings tho, needs more dogs lol)   Cons: 1. Honey boba, the texture is a bit slimy (kinda over cooked?) there's only a hint of a honey taste. Hopefully it'll be better next time I visit.   2. Signage above shop. Hopefully that is not the final sign, it does not give it a good first impression.   This is all I have for now, but let's just say I'll come back."}
{"text":"Wintermelon Milk Tea. W/ hot honey boba of course.  BOMB!  The wintermelon taste is strong and refreshing. Definitely great for a hot summer day since wintermelon supposedly helps to cools your body down. I would choose this drink again but with less sugar next time @_@. Probably half sweetness for my taste.  Among my favorites so far:  Almond Coffee Milk Tea Rose Milk Tea House Milk Tea Wintermelon Milk Tea Lemon Black Tea"}
{"text":"FIRST IMPRESSION. Good amount of parking space in the front. They also have air conditioning. Kind of a small space with small tables, they also play music that isn't too loud. I don't think big groups would be good because of the small table  like maybe 4-5 max will fit comfortably together unless you don't mind being kind of separate ..  Food/drink: I got the wintermelon fresh milk tea. I personally love wintermelon tea and was intrigued about a milk tea version because I have never seen that before! I can say that it didn't disappoint. Tastes like wintermelon tea .. With milk LOL. My friends got the Hokkaido milk tea and the honey green milk tea. I tried both their drinks. The Hokkaido milk tea is compared to have flavors of white rabbit candy in it. The honey green milk tea tastes like any other kind. I liked both their drinks.  Customer service: The employees here are very nice and polite. But that can also be because I came at a time where there was no one here(it was dead). Don't be afraid to ask for samples or ask about any of the drinks! I got a sample of the house milk tea, it was not too sweet; it had a brown sugar taste to it. Not the best house milk tea I've had so I passed on it, but you can try it, just ask for a sample.  My 2 friends and I took awhile to order and they were very patient and answered any questions we had about the drinks.   Right now they have a promotion of getting free rainbow jelly when you check in so don't forget! They also can adjust your drink if you think it's too sweet or not sweet enough! :)   Overall- 10/10 Customer service- 10/10 Quality food/drink- 10/10 Price- ~$3.50+"}
{"text":"Just bought oolong mike tea with boba. Boba is good but the taste of oolong tea is too weak. I think I will go back to Kung Fu Tea.  ????????????????????????????.????????????"}
{"text":"Still catching up on my long list of reviews and sorted though all the pics I've been posting on my Instagram. Out of the way but we used our bus pass. Good excuse to just get out of the general area. The decor is nice and hipster with color and funky art. Reminds me of something that I would see on either Main or Commercial Drive in Vancouver, therefore, I felt at home. I had some hot jasmine lavender tea and some bubble tea. I wanted to work on some reviews for my zine so this was a good place. Lots of seating and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time here today and I like this place! The location is pretty hidden but nicely decorated.. Fun and cute cat portraits all over the place!   What I like most about this place is that their regular size is HUGE! If you are planning on going around for the whole day, especially during the Vegas summer heat.. Definitely come here and get their \"regular\" size cup... Will last you all day! Not crazy expensive either.. A little over $5 depending on what you get. The staff made sure we we're happy with our tea and offered to fix it until we are satisfied! Very good tea overall!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place with my sister we find it very Lovely ambience and decor. The young lady who took my drink orders did an awesome job; super nice and excellent customer service..Thank you for adjusting the flavor on the taro smoothie. The strawberry smoothie was lovely. My daughter loved it and the milk tea is good too. Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Pretty good and cozy spot! I haven't tried their specialty teas but it's still a great and relaxing alternative to more popular boba places!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing strawberry mango smoothie. I tried bona for my first time and it's delicious"}
{"text":"Adorable cat-themed cafe in a sketchy run-down looking strip mall. Don't let the location hold you back, once inside, it's as cute and clean as any Taiwanese boba shop. My go-to is the #1 on their Top10 list - a blended ice-milk drink with boba+brown sugar+egg pudding. They have a large tea menu to choose from and I haven't had a bad one yet in my dozen+ visits :) The Okinawa ice coffee taste like coffee ice cream! Lots of food/snack offerings as well, they're still testing out diff menu items (the hot pot and red-oil dumplings I liked are no longer available so that means I'll have to try more stuff).  The happy guy that makes my drinks the past few times is always super friendly and always follows up asking about how your drink tastes. Service is great and they are happy to customize your drink to just the way you like it."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for your boba fix! Not only do they have tasty food, like popcorn chicken and rice, but they have every kind of boba flavor imaginable. Bonus cute cat art from local artists as the decor and if that's not enough they have board games to play! The only downside is the small space so there aren't many tables    The service is always great, I've never had to wait long and they are super friendly and attentive. There's one gal in particular who always greets everyone with a smile, explains everything on the menu, clears the table, and checks in to make sure everyone is happy. I'm not sure of her name but the positive vibes are welcoming!   This is the perfect chill spot to meet with friends and catch up over a hot cup of tea, get late night noms because you're too tired to cook, or enjoy a dessert while playing connect four!   Oh, and the serving sizes are generous for both food and drinks. Everything can easily be shared."}
{"text":"Well... they were out of boba. That was definitely a bummer. Their house made jelly wasn't special. The house milk tea was ehh. Great service and the drinks seems larger than most places. Honestly, not going back."}
{"text":"Boba is really tough, not liking that; but tea is tasty and service very good! Nice place to enjoy s conversation with friends!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and their sizes surprised me! I came here with five of my friends and four of them ordered small boba drinks. It came in a tall glass that looked like a large. My friend and I ordered regular sizes and our drinks came in massive 32 oz jars!!! I'm sure it could feed at least two or three people. They offer a lot of variety in their menu and the drinks are reasonably priced. I ordered the matcha milk tea with boba and red bean. The milk tea was not too sweet which I like.   Our waitress was very nice and accommodating to us, especially considering that our group was pretty large and their establishment is quite small. She was so understanding when some of us wanted to change our drinks while ordering. She also made sure that each of us liked our drinks, and we all did!  I heard that parking can be a problem but I came on a Friday at 6pm with no issues. What I don't really like about Tea Space is that it's a sit-down cafe, so we almost forgot to pay for our drinks up front after being there for a couple hours. Other than that, I will visit again because of the quality of the drinks and the kindness of the staff!"}
{"text":"Tea Space the tea place!   First off, I love the name of this new boba spot. I know that isn't super relevant, but I thought you ought to know.  Apparently they have only been open for ten days. The parking is much more convenient than other similar spots on Spring Mountain -cough- Tea Station -cough-. I got the House Milk tea with boba because when I try a place for the first time, I want to try what they think makes them noteworthy. Although, after looking over the menu a little more the most unique flavor they sell is probably Kumquat. I'll get that next time!  When I walked in a young man greeted me enthusiastically. I really appreciated that! He seemed genuinely excited to have my business, and that alone convinced me to order the regular size tea instead of small. Customer service is everything nowadays, and this place seems to have it!   The best part about my drink was that the boba was hot! It sounds weird but the first drink I had consisted of ice cold drink with hot boba. It was AWESOME. Obviously, the boba cooled as it sat in my iced drink but if there is any test of freshness I think that would be it. It didn't make the ice melt any faster either, it was just fun because I hadn't experience that before in a boba tea. The drink tasted stronger than some other places where I have tried milk tea, but I liked it more for that. They crushed the ice in front of me using a blender which felt unique. It's a small place, but they do have seating if you want to chill out for a while.   All in all, it ended up being five dollars and some change which was fair for the amount of tea in the regular. I didn't even end up finishing it! The cups aren't super cute or sealed with plastic like at other places, but I didn't mind that. I'm excited to go back and check out more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day, but Tea Space was completely empty when I walked in. The girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful when I was deciding what type of drink to get.   The House Green (Jasmine) Milk Tea was on the \"top ten\" menu and also came highly recommended on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. I took a sip and it didn't taste good so I thought maybe adding more sweetener would do the trick. Another sip after the adjustment and it wasn't any better, but I felt bad for being bothersome so I just took it (I also wasn't sure how to fix it beyond just having it remade). I think there was actually too much milk in the tea, because it tasted almost like water. Not a strong tea flavor, but not a creamy consistency either. The boba was good though; honey flavored with the right amount of chew.   My boyfriend got a mango green tea, and his was better than mine. However, this one had a bitter aftertaste. I am a fan of strong tea, but this tasted like it had steeped for a too long.   Stars for the good customer service, but unfortunately our drinks were a miss on this visit."}
{"text":"Best pop corn chick that I found!!  If you from La area, u will familiar with half and half tea. This place pretty much is a copy cat of that place. Well I just happy that I have found a new hang out place in this dessert city.  The place is so neat and btw they are cats maniac!!  Their tea is pretty light in sweet if you ask for less sugar so it's perfect for me.  I just can't wait to coming back!!"}
{"text":"The taro smoothie with boba is out of control good, and it has a great vibe inside and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Best boba in Vegas. I definitely recommend the Lavender tea with boba. Great brick toast too. Perfect staff, always so welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend said this was the best part of our Vegas trip. Coming from the boba capital of CA, I was impressed.   Boba Quality: on point. Drink Quality: on point. Staff hospitality: perfect. We came in with an order for 11 people. They hooked it up."}
{"text":"I honestly love how cute this place is, but the drinks was too sweet :(  We got the Hokkaido milk tea and Okinawa milk tea. Both were super sweet. I'll come back to try again though! Maybe it was just that one odd time   On the positive note, they have lots of adorable artworks! Cards and board games are a plus too."}
{"text":"Yum! Looking for a place to beat the Vegas heat? Tea space is one of the places to be. Their menu has a nice twist to the boba world here in Vegas. They have both milk and soy milk drinks. I tried the Hokkaido milk smoothie while my fiancé tried the ice soy milk caramel. Both delicious and sweet (the Hokkaido was a little too sweet for me). The icing on top of everything was their honey boba! Sooooo good & adds a tasty sweetness to your drink. On top of the yummy beverages, I was entertained by the cuteness of their kitty decor! You can say it was almost puuurrrrfect ;)"}
{"text":"Great flavors, fantastic boba, cute atmosphere, and friendly service. The drinks are fairly cheap for the amount you are getting. They have stamp cards for a (almost) free drink after buying ten. Trina is super nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Another cute boba spot to hit spring mountain, across the street from the famous Kung fu tea house. Their menu is very very similar to HALF N HALF tea house in LA.  I got the Logan tea with fresh milk (4/5) very tasty but it was very sweet. But they were accommodating and fixed the sweetness to my liking. My boyfriend got the regular size house milk tea (4/5) with honey boba. Milk tea was good, but the Boba was a little under cooked.  For the most part, I would come here again. Only if the line at Kung fu tea is a mile long. Hahaha"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you'll notice that this place has a huge cat fetish. There are cat decorations everywhere! There is also art for sale on the wall and tables for you to eat and hang out. Don't go looking for the menu on the wall as I did; menus are printed in booklet form at the register.  I was happy to see that they offered wintermelon fresh milk tea, so of course I had to order it. Unfortunately, the smile on my face turned upside down shortly after drinking a few sips because a few sips was all I got. The drink was good but there wasn't much of it. If you go and take a look at my before and after pics of my drink posted on Yelp, you can see that my cup was more than 50% ice. I drank my drink in less than two minutes. What a rip off! They are still in their soft opening phase, so I I hope this review helps Tea Space improve their drinks for future customers.   Would I give this place another try? Sure why not. Maybe I'll ask for less ice next time."}
{"text":"Located right on the intersection of Spring Mountain and Decatur, this new boba tea \"cafe\" just opened and I highly recommend it. They have somewhat late hours during their soft opening, until 11pm roughly, which is fantastic.  They have a good selection of drinks made in various ways with green or black tea and lots of different kinds of toppings. Their boba was hot and fresh, even in my iced drink, which by the way was GIGANTIC. I think the \"regular\" size here is around 32 oz, but for the same price that many places charge for a 24oz. One interesting point I would like to note is that whatever flavor/ingredients they use to make their drinks did not \"dilute\" or fade a few hours later when my friend had a chance to taste their drink, which can sometimes happen to other places' drinks that are otherwise fine.  The honey boba has a palpable sweet taste to it, which I love. I got the Okinawa (brown sugar) milk tea with boba, and my friend got the Honey black milk tea. The Okinawa tea had a very strong flavor, which I liked a lot. I tried some of the honey black milk tea, and personally prefer honey black milk tea to have a stronger flavor whenever I get it myself, but it was still delicious.  If I could change anything (which maybe I could have, I didn't ask, so ... who knows!) it would be that I'd prefer a little more boba to be included with the regular size as standard. I think next time I come I will order extra boba, as I think other places tend to put a tiny bit more by default. Also, the boba was fresh and chewy, but I think I prefer my boba to be just a little softer/squishier (not soggy necessarily but yeah).  Both employees working at the front on 10:30pm Saturday were extremely polite, and made me feel very at home - the cashier answered any questions I had without hesitation. I think this place will very soon be one of the best boba spots in Vegas once they get settled in fully, even when compared with the slew of other boba places nearby in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I got a large Thai tea with extra boba . Total came out to almost $7-- yikes! It was a 32 oz cup and they hardly put any boba in it even though I paid for extra boba ! Their Thai tea wasn't the best I've had .... it's just okay but I wouldn't get it again here because I've had one wayyyy better else where before."}
{"text":"The servings are large, the theme is cats and the vibe of the cafe is very chill and relaxing. The place is well-decorated; board games are provided to break the ice or pass some time. I ended up ordering the Wintermelon Slush with Rose Water (if I'm not mistaken) Boba. It was delicious but I had to take the rest on the go because I couldn't finish the drink in one sitting. Overall, fun experience! I recommend it for an after-date-night, or a winding down moment with friends! Will visit again when I'm around that area! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"The only chance we might come back is if they train these women especially Joyce on how to be a decent human being.  We use to come here at least once a week since my husband loves the bigger cups, hokkaido milk tea with extra sea salt cream and honey boba. Also, the owner and 3 other men who helped us always treated us well; welcoming and accommodated our adjustments on our drinks. (I personally don't love the drinks here, but that's another story. I find them all basic)   Actually, all boba shops make it their pride to adjust drinks to your liking. Not sure who hired these women (Joyce), but forget adjustments, they give you the stink eye and a hard time.  We asked if they had Crystal boba today and Joyce says \"No we never did.\" (Even though they served it to us a couple times in the past.) We kindly asked if they took it off the menu? Joyce repeated herself, \"No, we don't have it. We never had it\"...she says it a few more times in a rude manner. Makes you want to roll your eyes after the second time. LOL! Arguing is ill-advised and it makes you look like a real jerk.  I've noticed that whenever the women employees are working, we ALWAYS have a negative experience. The drinks always come out tasting wrong and tonight was the LAST TIME we will ever come back. Joyce, was training another girl on the register and was on some sort of bull shit high horse. She was flat out rude and refused to adjust our drinks to our liking. She went out of her way to make a simple adjustment request into an argument. Why did it have to become awkward and embarrasing!!!???  Our drinks came out and my husband requested his sea salt cream topped off like they always do for him. It's just 2 tablespoons more of sea salt cream and we were happy to pay any extra topping costs. Every time we come here the men accomodates, including the owner. Trust me, It's not a wild request!   ...This is where it gets fun...  Joyce says, \"No we don't do that.\" :/ We go back and forth about this for a few minutes. It was extremely awkward.   L O L  Que? We come here ALL OF THE TIME & every single time we come here, we order the SAME EXACT DRINK and they ALWAYS, ALWAYS do it for us. However, when high horse Joyce lady is here, they don't do anything apparently. She is an expert at rolling her eyes and walking away though. Yeah, we saw that too, Joyce.   \"We don't do that\" is the motto here.   Welp, if you don't do anything here, then we will happily go to the 10 other great boba shops in the same neighborhood.   You are cheap, lack customer service and common sense. I'm beyond frustrated we had to deal with this and we asked for a refund."}
{"text":"My new go to and favorite boba shop. Right when you walk in you get a little sense of modernized furniture and vibe than what it looks like outside. I went ahead and looked at their menu that they hand out while the cashier was taking care of another customer. I'm a big oolong milk tea drinker, so I was definitely going to get that. They have 2 options of whether you want regular milk tea or fresh milk tea, in which I'm guessing that the tea and milk for that specific menu option is made fresh on the spot. But either or I chose the fresh milk tea.  As I waited for my drink you can see they have a few art collections on their wall... In which they have a lot of cat pictures. I'm not a cat person but the pictures are pretty cool and a few were pretty cute in the way it was drawn.   Getting my drink, the young man that made my drink offered if I wanted to sweeten my drink if I'm not too satisfied with the sweetness. In their milk tea you can see the separation of tea and milk first hand, which is pretty cool to me that they do that. Taking my first sip I can definitely taste the nice blend of tea and milk. The milk itself wasn't too sweet whatsoever, which I really do appreciate because I do want to taste the tea itself too. They don't mask the flavor of the tea with the sweetness of the milk perfectly. The lychee jelly I got in it tasted pretty fresh and paired well with my drink.  Overall 2 thumbs up and 5 stars all around for my new favorite boba/tea spot."}
{"text":"Great boba tea place close to the strip.  This is the husband's favorite boba place in Vegas, while mine is Chewy Boba, although this place is a very close second for me.  I ordered the Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte + Rose Boba, while the husband ordered House Milk Tea + Grass Jelly + Pudding.  The cashier was quick to say that they currently only offer rose boba as oppose to honey boba, I guess people have been complaining about that? I liked the rose boba, although I've never tried the honey boba, so can't really make a fair comparison.  The drinks were both good, as a lot of reviewers have stated, the drink size here is abnormally big, the regular size is probably extra large elsewhere.  I thought the sea salt latte was a little overpowering, as opposed to the sea salt coffee at Chewy Boba, which was the perfect amount of saltiness.    The space is super adorable, wish we had time to sit and try some of the food.  The service was friendly and prompt.  Would definitely recommend others to try this place."}
{"text":"Great service! The guy at the check out was very helpful and patient. He answered all of our questions and pointed out the most popular drinks. The guy who made the drinks for our popped out to make sure we enjoyed our drinks. The cat theme is just about the cutest thing ever!"}
{"text":"Rose milk tea with green tea and honey boba is really good! Friendly staffs. Clean space. I will be coming again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place, especially the coffee milk tea! The staff are also extremely nice and friendly. We were visiting from Toronto and were not disappointed :) always trust Taiwanese people to make excellent bubble tea"}
{"text":"Apart from being absolutely superior boba, the atmosphere here was calming, the inside was clean, and the customer service more than amicable."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place, so I decided to drop by for a quick pick me up. I ordered the Okinawa coffee in the light bulb. My drink came out quickly. It was pretty good. I definitely recommend the Okinawa coffee. If you want the light bulb cup it's $0.99 extra."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the staff. I think the cashier girl was really clueless about the drinks there. She was confused half of the time and put in the wrong order.   I came in and looked at the top drinks chart on the wall and I decided to go with the White Gourd Fresh milk tea with half boba and half grass jelly. I shouldn't have gotten it. The cashier girl put in \"less boba less, less grass jelly\" when I asked for HALF and HALF. I ended up paying a full dollar for such little toppings. The boba was good, chewy but not the best. The grass jelly was broken into tiny little pieces; it's like they gave me leftover, smashed up jelly. Then I asked for the sea salted creme or whatever and I honestly couldn't taste the little saltiness of it and wasted $.99 for nothing. It didn't make a difference. The white gourd was just really sweet. My regular size drink came up to $6.11 It was big, but I didn't really enjoy it.  But I honestly do believe that I ordered the wrong thing here so I will give this place another chance. I didn't experience what others have told me about this place and quite disappointed."}
{"text":"After Urban Crawfish, we had to get some milk teas to hide that garlic breath! FYI - that's really not possible. That garlic be brutal. ha  Tea Space is located in a shopping strip next to a gas station and it looks a little sketchy from the outside. Once you walk inside, it's nicely decorated and if you're into cats - this place is for you!   I ordered the small lavender milk tea with honey boba. The lavender flavor was very mild so I asked to have to add more but it was the same. It a syrup that they use so perhaps the lavender wasn't infused enough? The honey boba was good and highly recommended if you order a sinker.  The \"small\" is 16oz and the \"regular\" is 20oz which I found a little strange."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing and the staff was very kind. Ask for for the Tony special! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the no AC upon walking in and waiting here especially in the hot state of Nevada. We had an order for 9 drinks and we waited at least 15 mins. That is being first in line. Had we waited any longer, I would've asked for a refund. There were 2 guys working the boba area and several others in the kitchen area. A third guy showed up at the end but at that point, we had already waited a long time. The flavor was okay. Nothing beyond any other boba place in my opinion. And I have tried a lot. The food variety that people were eating looked good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I work for a food industry and I believe the manager especially was very greedy with their price menu. Moreover, they charged us 5 extra dollars for an addition person to eat their hot pot. That I do not get. I understand if it was an all you can eat selection but it was just a regular entree. They said it was a \"company policy\". I still can't believe this was even a thing just for an entree. Have not heard anything about this. Employees were awesome but it was just the manager that I had a problem with."}
{"text":"I was recommended the strawberry green tea and it's del ious!!! Also, they have takoyaki here!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a little quiet. As most people populate the east side of Chinatown in mass, Tea Space is largely left untouched by the throngs of tourists.   Staff is beyond kind and friendly here.  Space is simple and very clean, and you can get plenty done.   Didn't order anything flashy or complicated, just a green tea with bubbles and (free) rainbow jelly in it. There certainly is solid bang for the buck when you pay the 99 cents to get the large, which is closer in size to Texan.   For a quick bubble tea fix without the mess of looking for parking, Tea Space is a great choice."}
{"text":"House milk tea is very milky. Regular milk tea has a strong flavor for almost like a latte to me. Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly cashier, emptyish parking lot (compared to Kung fu tea), a stamp card AND super large drinks that are well priced but...  I ordered a house green tea with less milk because I wanted a stronger tea flavor and that is exactly what I got. Very strong tea but not sweet at all. I did order a regular size with boba but ended up adding some honey to my drink once I got home. I'm not sure if they have sweetener in their cream but next one I'll stick to a regular house green milk tea.  I also ordered a regular Hokkaido milk tea and wanted to add less milk but was told that they can't adjust it because it's a powder and premade. Brew tea allows for adjustments on their Hokkaido milk tea. The Hokkaido milk tea is ok, not overly sweet but definitely not one of my favorites.   Some people compared tea space so half & half. I'm from SoCal and LOVE half and half so I'll be back to try their iced milk drinks."}
{"text":"This place is super good! The mini hot pot is tasty and the milk tea is good."}
{"text":"Tea Space is literally a few minutes away from Kung Fu Tea so I kind of had some worries already for this new boba joint. Anyways, Tea Space is next to Church's Chicken in a plaza with plenty of parking.  The first time I came in, I was already greeted by the owner and he hands me a menu. He was very patient as I decided what to get and I finally decided on their \"regular\" size longan fresh milk tea. They have two sizes which one seems like their small and then their \"regular\" which is much, much larger for +.99 charge.  I also got their house milk tea for my sister which had a brown sugar base. I didn't really like it but I did like the hot honey boba. Oh and I also enjoyed my longan fresh milk tea, it was refreshing. I came again with a friend and this time I got a Hokkaido smoothie and he got a mango slush. The Hokkaido was just right and the boba was perfect. You could tell that they also added real fruit into the mango slush because it was more of a smoothie consistency and the sweetness was just right.  Overall, the interior is very comfortable and all those cat decorations are incredibly adorable. The employees and the owner are super sweet and the drinks are very good. Even though it is very close to Kung Fu Tea, I feel like they're going to catch up quick and it is definitely more satisfying to relax in instead of that constant line. I will be coming back soon :-)"}
{"text":"MY NEW FAV TEA SPACE IN VEGAS!! Located in this tiny plaza in China Town.   Came here three time but on my second trip to Vegas, we came two days in a row! Our Crew just love it so much!!  The atmosphere, games, art work and customer service was great!!   Regular size is huge 32Oz!!  I tried both almond milk tea and lemon winter melon tea with boba.  The tea flavor was good and not too sweet or sour! They give you good amount of boba which is nicely cook! not to hard, not too soft.   Workers are super friendly and made sure that all of us like our drinks which we did! They will also remake your drink if you don't like it. You also get a lot of option for tea and some food options available.   I have to say Vegas might have better boba places then OC. Will def come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Saturday night with tables full of chatting customers, but was waited on with a smile immediately upon entering.  Luckily, I knew what I wanted to order before arriving, so I wasn't put on the spot deciding what I wanted from the paper menu handed to me.  I ordered the Okinawa milk tea with hot honey boba and it was AMAZING! I couldn't put it down till it was finished!    The only minor issues I encountered were the main door was extremely hard to open, especially when you're holding a huge beverage and the parking lot was near capacity, and there were several people from the bus stop wandering around my car, which was a little unnerving.  I also noticed the big white syrup jugs they used for flavoring drinks which I would prefer not to drink, so I will probably opt for a place that uses fresh fruit when ordering any fruity drinks.  Other than that, I will definitely be back again for the addictive Okinawa milk tea and hot honey boba. I loved the contrast of ice and hot gooey, chewy boba all in one cup. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Best Okinawa coffee, best grassy jelly, best brown sugar slush, best strawberry mango slush, best lychee slush, best lychee jelly... my point is, you can not go wrong with any of the drinks here! I'll have to come back one of these days and order some of their snacks along with my drink."}
{"text":"We've been to many milk tea places in Vegas and this one tops certainly tops the list! I love a strong tea flavor in my milk tea and we definitely found it here. They serve the boba warm too abd it has a nice sweet honey flavor which compliments the flavor of the tea nicely.  We had the House Milk Tea with Boba and Pudding and the Longan Green Milk Tea with Boba - both highly recommended!   We like the milk tea here better than Kung Fu Tea! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"i had a 10 stamp card, but i ordered one drink and they couldn't use the card because my price wasn't over 3.69 or something. ordered a jasmine milk tea with extra sweet and there was no sweetness at all."}
{"text":"Very good milk tea. Not too sweet and not too much ice. Two of us shared a regular sized taro with milk and honey boba. The service is excellent and the cashier girl is knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I'm a big fan of the food and drink.  I ordered a small milk tea with honey boba and a beef don.   The drink wss enormous and my dinner was very tasty. I'll return!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a big ole glass of milk tea before going to the park and this place was pleasantly surprising.   It reminds me of the vibe of an Austin coffee shop mixed with Pacific flavor!   I went with the speciality milk tea, the Okinawa milk tea to be excat. This bad boy was pretty sweet yo the taste and totally perked me up after downing the large size glass! Delish!  The barista at the counter was super bubbly and helped me navigate my selection. She also gave me a handy dandy punch card to use on my next visit.   Great vibes at this joint all around."}
{"text":"Hot boba!!! does not equal hot body... consume responsibly :-P  I like their menu, especially how it's folded up small and handy. I like the interior design, lighting, tables, bench, and chairs. Recycled use supporting green environment. Very cool interior.  I've tried Taro smoothie and Coffee smoothie with honey boba. So far so yum! Currently they're only offering dumplings for food. No other food items on the menu.   Seems like a good place to hangout, get work done. It's semi quiet. They're on Decatur and Spring Mountain next to an insurance place. Almost easy to miss so drive slow.  They love cats!!! Maybe I can bring my cats, leave them and they wouldn't notice :-P  I wanna try their peach and mango smoothies next. Until then, stay hot... Boba."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my sister and niece, good atmosphere, love the cat theme going on. I like how it's really chill, and it's so close to everything. Different from the other places in town. I like their menu selection, but I always order my favorite drink."}
{"text":"Great spot for boba. The small was HUGE!  Tried the snacks but not the food ...yet! Its a nice little hang out spot with board games (a plus!). Customer service has been great so far. No complaints!"}
{"text":"The manager was amazing! Very friendly and gave a great recommendation as it was our first time.  He had us taste it to ensure we were happy with the selection, offering to add to it if we found it too sweet or not sweet enough or offered to provide a different drink altogether.  We didn't find that necessary as the drink was perfect as it was.  The milk tea were about $6/each and the drink size appeared like a \"large\" size."}
{"text":"Nice quiet drink spot!  My parents both ordered the okinawa coffee, gf ordered the house green milk tea, and I ordered the hokkaido milk tea. All the drinks were pretty damn good, but my favorite out of the bunch would be the house green milk tea.   I want to give everyone a heads up... the drinks here are very strong! After drinking the hokkaido milk tea around 8 or 9pm, I could not fall asleep until 2 or 3am. The next day, my parents mentioned that they were unable to sleep until the early AM. All 4 of us are avid coffee drinkers so this is a forewarning."}
{"text":"FINALLY a place that gets rose milk tea right.   I'm constantly on the hunt for a perfectly flavor balanced rose milk tea, and my search has finally ended.   A coworker of mine got me on a boba kick recently, and I've tried a handful of places around town hoping to find one that hits the spot.   I was considering studying there, but the place was a little warm for my liking considering it was nighttime. The lady who rang me up was friendly and efficiently got my drink out. I wish they had a non-dairy \"milk tea\" but this will definitely suffice when I'm in the mood for my rose boba!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to boba place in Vegas! With so much boba cafes in the area, it can get hard to choose which ones to go to, but this place always have good service, fresh boba, and awesome tea selections. And for a limited time only, they are having rose boba....it's PRETTY in PINK!! Another reason to stop by here before it runs out!  Their drink sizes are hugeee!! Their regular size i think is 32 oz, and it's a dollar extra than the menu price, which shows the \"small\" size.  Parking area is small, but I never had any issues with it.  I definitely recommend the lavender milk tea!"}
{"text":"It's sad that the service got bad compared to when they first opened. Used to have supper there but now after they ask me to wait for 15min and told me the kitchen is closed. Would totally appreciate if they tell customer beforehand. This is basic rule."}
{"text":"Place is so small and cute. Their staff is very friendly and attentive. They do have a hot pot, Boba, and some other appetizers like takoyaki, and more.. make sure to ask for a stamp card if you're planning to come back here. Their location is behind the church's chicken."}
{"text":"My favorite boba place in town  the boba always tastes so sweet and fresh and the employees are so sweet and willing to help with any questions or concerns"}
{"text":"What a great little find! A friend and I were in the mood for some boba and realized this place was right there. Not only was the tea good, the dumplings are fantastic. They're made from scratch by the auntie in the shop and they are so fresh. We weren't even hungry but we finished everything."}
{"text":"Love the decor and feel here, and I'm so happy that there is finally a place in Vegas that does a good ice milk drink!"}
{"text":"Came here cause a friend mentioned it. Not going to lie, the portion for the drinks seems pretty big (which is good if you like drinking milk tea or their other beverages) I got a small Hokkaido with egg pudding and even though it took me a while to finish, I'd say it's really worth it. The atmosphere is really chill. Good place to study for an exam or to just hang out with people. They also got games that you can play with your friends. Will definitely come back! Don't forget to get a stamp card!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tea combinations I've tried. The food is crazy good. My addiction is definitely the popcorn chicken. The flavor just pops. Customer service is on point. They always go the extra mile for the patrons. Definitely a must try, careful it's addicting."}
{"text":"Tea space. Really good tapioca! Aside from the delightful bubbles they also serve variety of milk tea and other assorted tea drinks. What gets me the most is that they also serve hotspot.   The cat theme walls facing the seats are pretty cool, some might call it cute but I'm loyal to my dog. Service is just perfect, soon as you walk in you're greeted and seated promptly. I order the house milk tea with bubbles and grass jelly. I was thinking regular size would be a medium size but it actually looked like a large. I had a laugh with the server about if this is an smaller size what's a merge size look like.   The house milk tea taste like no other. In always down to try new milk teas but this one is definitely way different than all the other I've tried. I really enjoyed the my order and looking forward to trying the hot pot with a side of milk tea.   Highly recommend this joint, cool cat theme, bubble teas and hot pot!"}
{"text":"It is testy  good. I have  Popcorn Chicken and green tea boba and green tea with red bean, It is so good"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for quite sometimes now and I really enjoyed their tea and snacks!! I have been looking for Taiwanese snacks (popcorn chicken) for awhile and when I found out this place sells then I was thrilled!!!! There is few disappointments but I'll say the owner took very seriously not only he was so patient to hear me out he also complimented me with coupons if my next visit ! I have to give him two thumbs up for being professional and understanding!!!! Then I went back using my coupon order what I always ordered House boba tea and popcorn chicken and they corrected the mistakes and made it sooooo delicious I was happy that they listened and really improved!!!! I will continue going there I enjoy being there that I can relax playing games with my kids ! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Right next to a Church's Chicken, you'd never think that such a cute place would be in a sketchy-looking plaza. But it was a happy surprise discovering this place. With a cat theme and all your boba spot essentials (hipster feel, board games, very aesthetic), it's not a bad place to have your post-meal tea time or to hang around and talk.  Looking at their menu, it's more than your typical milks tea fare. Along with the usual expansive drink menu and some smaller appetizers, they have a full hotpot menu. It can be a little confusing however because the place sports two menus, both with the entire drink list, but one has the hotpot menu on the back and the other has other foods. Ordering felt really awkward as well because the server was pretty bashful.  What I was not expecting were the sizes of the drinks. The large was bigger than my friends head. I had their matcha fresh milk tea with rose boba because they had run out of their other boba. The tea seemed to be steeped too long because the tea tasted very bitter. But because my company said their drinks and the takoyaki they ordered had been good, I think I'll come back and give it one more shot."}
{"text":"I went to this place last night to give it a try, bc I was kind of getting tired of kft. Even thought they close @ 11 and came at 10:50ish, the boba was still warm and fresh!!! I got the okinawa milk tea and the balance between the sweet and tea-ish taste was perfect! The prices are so gr8 for their sizes.   My fav new boba spot."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best boba places in this Vegas area. We usually go to Kung fu but we noticed a few new ones had opened up in the area and wanted to try  This place is legit.. I can't rave enough about it. For those who are fans of half and half in the SGV or Rowland area, their drinks are close to half and half's in taste minus the gigantic cups...which I dislike anyways  I got the mango green tea with sea salt latte. The tea is fragrant and flavorful and their mango flavoring is really good. Not artificial tasting at all! Ratio of latte foam to tea was amazing... creamy enough without being overly milky!  Boba was on the softer side if you like that...  Will definitely make this a must stop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! I'm glad they have another awesome boba place in the Vegas area. This place would probably be in one of my top picks (along with Brew tea and Half and Half). I love boba and it was nice to find a good place because I have tried a bunch of other places which were either decent or straight up horrible. This place definitely reminds me of Half and Half because of their menu design and drink selections.   So far I have tried the lavender milk tea, iced milk with caramel, honey green tea, and strawberry milk tea. All of these drinks were pretty good and I love how the regular size is super huge, but it makes sense since you are pretty much paying $6 bucks for a drink. You can definitely taste the tea in the drinks. My biggest pet peeve is when my drink straight up tastes diluted. I'd expect to at least taste some hint of the tea.  The boba quality has definitely gotten better compared to the first time I got here. I'd say it ranks up there along with Brew Tea.   Also, the staff is super nice so if you aren't satisfied with your drink they will gladly remake it until you are happy. I do have to admit that I had to have my drinks remade at times, but they turn out pretty good. I am tempted to try the Hokkaido or Okinawa milk tea, but those are my go to drinks at Brew Tea and I probably have high expectations because of that.   I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. If worse comes to worse, Kung Fu is literally right across the street lol. Their design is also awesome! It has that hipster cafe kinda vibe to it. The best part is they have cat pictures and other cool artwork (super heroes, Alice in Wonderland, etc). They even have a black cat in a bird cage xDDD."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. The food taste super good  here and the workers are all really nice ! Will come back again. ????? ??????"}
{"text":"This is the only place I get Boba tea from! The employees are always friendly & it's inexpensive. If they make a mistake, they'll replace your order free of charge. I do wish they had Rose milk tea though but other than that I would recommend."}
{"text":"A cute little tea spot in China town!! I like the decoration inside and the girl that was working was super nice and friendly. I got Jasmine tea with boba. It came out in less than 30 seconds. Nice! I like quick service. The Jasmine tea I got was way too bitter and tasted a little old. Just like the Jasmine tea I make at home. (I make tea and sometimes forget about it for a couple of hours. Taste too bitter and a little old) Maybe because I ordered it unsweetened...?! The boba was nice and sweet and chewy. Next time, I'll try their dessert drink with boba!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. The staff was really friendly and helpful. The atmosphere and menu graphics seem very similar to Kung Fu Tea to me. Anyways I got the Okinawa coffee with sea salt cream and the strawberry (black tea) milk tea for my boo. For a first impression, their boba is really good. A staff member warned me that their coffee is a bit strong but would adjust it if I didn't like it. It was on the strong side but still good. I just didn't feel like going through the hassle of making them change it for me. But I actually think I liked my boyfriend's drink more. It was just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"After becoming obsessed with boba, I had to try out this new place! the location is a bit odd & kind of inconvenient depending on which way you are coming from.   I got the almond fresh milk tea and the coffee milk tea. I upgraded to a regular size for 99 cents but next time I would stay with a small. The regular is about the size of a large drink at a fast food restaurant.   The staff here is extremely personable and friendly which made my experience that much better!! it wasn't extremely crowded which I definitely liked in comparison to Kung fu tea or Brew tea.   My drink was tasty, but I would probably not come back unless I'm near the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite boba place! Tasty milk teas, good selection of toppings. Will be back to try the food!! Love the art on the walls and the plush animals at the seat area."}
{"text":"The BOBA is FRESH and SWEET!   The reason why Boba places exist is because of their Boba, not their drinks.   So far Tea Space has met the Boba expectation. The ambiance is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe their regular size drink is like 32OZ.  Came with my best friend to get our tea fix and it was really empty. The staff was really friendly in helping us decide what to drink. We usually get the same type of drinks everywhere but they were able to answer questions for us. Drinks came out really quickly and we were on our way.   Make sure you pick up a stamp card if you want to come back!  Parking: Plenty of it."}
{"text":"They seriously have the best boba I've ever had, not just in Vegas but in general. Soft on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside and their tea is pretty fire too."}
{"text":"This place is a bit hard to find due to faded signs, but inside is completely different.  Very nice, cozy decorations, and the drinks are great!  Probably the best in LV!"}
{"text":"Tea Space is a relatively new cafe located in Chinatown. It has limited space, but it is never overly crowded. I was there for about 2 hours to work on my school assignment. It was quiet enough to read, and I was able to actually concentrate on my assignment.   They have a variety of drinks and snacks. It is great for late-night snack time. I had their boba tea with popcorn chicken, and they were both delicious.  Nothing stands out, but no complaints either; in a sense, it's just a typical boba spot.   Their staff is amazing. They were very friendly and helpful. I needed some help when I was ordering because of their long menu. Thankfully, the staff made some great suggestions, and I was satisfied with everything I ordered.  Tea Space is in a awkward location, but it's worth trying. It is one of the better boba places in town."}
{"text":"Tea Space is the place to go if you want a huge cup of boba near Chinatown. Their normal size is like the size of a large anywhere else and they have an even bigger size if you prefer for $1 extra. I've only been here twice and they were very different experiences. My first visit was a weekday afternoon and I ordered the #1, the large House Milk Tea with Boba and Pudding (~$6). This visit was great, our group hung out for hours playing a card game they had lying around called Flip City. My drink was great, lasted a long time because I got a large, though next time I might as for it less sweet. There was a steady stream of customers but the place wasn't packed and the atmosphere was chill.  On my second visit, I came on a Saturday night and witnessed the popularity of this place firsthand. Every table was taken, the line was to the door, and people were loudly playing card games. Alright, so I decided to just get something to take home. This time I ordered another thing on the top 10, a large Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte (~$6.50) and asked for it less sweet. The lady at the register was nice and she asked me to try it and make sure it was okay. The drink was ridiculously sweet and I asked her if they could make it even less sweet. Someone took it to the back but I saw them just add plain water into the drink and mix it up... (water? why not just add more of the coffee?) Sure enough, when I was asked to try it again it tasted like watered down coffee. I gave up. I waited long enough in line and the place was so packed that I didn't want to stay there any longer. Really disappointing as the drinks are fairly expensive compared to other boba shops.  Final Thoughts: I've noticed a lot of uncanny similarities between this place and a chain of boba places in LA called Half and Half. From their paper menu design, to their top ten layout and large boba cups, its all eerily similar and I'm curious if they're affiliated. I had one good experience and one bad experience thus far. I like their location but I'll definitely avoid busy days and times here. I still think Brew Tea Bar is the best boba place in town but Tea Space is a decent alternative if you're near Chinatown."}
{"text":"I've been coming here the past few months and forget to review this place. It's located in the Chinatown area in a funky looking plaza in the Northeast corner of Decatur & Spring Mountain.   Once you enter Tea Space, it has this dark and inviting atmosphere with a lot of Cat decor. However it's spacious and creative use of space with bench seating against the wall and repurposed tables with metal chairs.  Some of the few drinks I enjoy is.... 1. Wintermelon Green Tea- Balanced flavor of sweet and refreshing flavor. 2. Passion Fruit Black Tea- Fruity tea that is balanced and refreshing great with Lychee Jelly. 3. Hokkaido Milk Tea- (Taste like White Rabbit Candy)  The toppings are delicious especially their boba; Sweet, Chewy and Consistent texture throughout. Lychee Jelly is flavorful and sweet but I'm biased with Lychee, one of my favs.   Every member of the staff is very friendly and helpful especially in deciding what drink(s) you want. They always allow adjustments if your drink is not made the way you want, definitely a good way to make your clients satisfied. Will be back for more Tea!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly people, cute interior.Cons: Felt a bit rushed when ordering. I thought they were about to close or something.  I've seen this place on yelp before and finally had the chance to try it. We came by around 9PM on a Friday night and it wasn't that busy. I ordered strawberry mango slush and spicy dumpling soup. The slush was taste pretty good, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, though you have the option to adjust the drink. The dumpling soup was ok. The souo tasted like chili oil and water and nothing else, but the dumpling itself taste good.  Overall I liked the atmosphere, it's pretty chill like if you just want to hang out with your friends, maybe even study. I'll come back to try on other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute when you walk in! There are cute little tables with a cosy but casual vibe. Lots of colourful, local art on the wall and fun plush toys (that could use a wash, but still) as well as some games such as Connect 4 to keep you busy while you wait for your order. We were greeted straight away when we walked in and took some menus to browse. There's a good amount of seating separate from the main café that you can use to browse menus or wait for to-go's. The menu is pretty vast and there are a lot of options, so I really appreciated that they had a board of the top 10 customer choices to consider. The gent behind the counter helped answer some questions I had about the menu and we ordered a coffee milk tea and lavender milk tea, both with boba. It wasn't until I asked about sweetness and whether it could be modified that the server mentioned anything. It's also not clear in the café so just be aware that if you don't want a super sweet drink, that you can opt for less sugar. The drinks themselves were good! The coffee milk tea was perfect and the lavender one was subtle but you could taste the flavour along with the tea too. All in all, a great little place. We wouldn't go out of our way but when we're in the area, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time I went to this joint was the last time I went. The location is so sketch. Why is this place next to a foot spa and a doggy place, that's nasty. Secondly, I watched the guy make my drink and he took a look over at me in a way where it looked like he was checking if I was staring or not. Seemed like he was doing something he wasn't supposed to. We ordered a Taro Boba and we were expecting a taro slush, not milk tea and some chucky fries taro. He jusy threw it into the bottom of the cup. The place was completely empty too. These are probably paid reviews to say its good. lul"}
{"text":"Bad attitude; i got hurt by the pictureon the wall and i told them, they didn't even respond and find out a solution."}
{"text":"I'm sure just like everyone else who has stepped foot in this cafe, my first thought was: \"wow, there's a lot of cat-themed art in here.\" Also, similar to my previously review on Bund Shanghai (located in the plaza diagonally across the street), Tea Space is in a very sketchy mini plaza, but they have transformed the interior to a cozy, neighborhood tea house. Their extensive menu includes snacks such as dumplings and even hot pot in addition to coffee,tea, and yogurt!  If you're the type who can't decide, look no further than their easily visible Top 10 menu behind the counter. It looks like the rankings have changed a bit from previous photos. At the top of the list was the Okinawa coffee with sea salt latte, which was the one I ended up trying. For $0.99 more, you can get a 32 oz. \"regular\" size, which felt like I was drinking a Big Gulp. It was a little on the sweeter side and if I were to order it again, I would get 3/4 sweetness. Other popular drinks on the list include wintermelon, Hokkaido milk tea, and ice milk.   My girlfriend mentioned that this tea house is similar to Half and Half for those of you who are fans. If anything, it's a cool place to hang out. Also, it's right next to Church's Chicken, so there's also that."}
{"text":"They have improved a lot since the last time I came here.   First, their boba is consistently hot and chewy (this was my biggest complaint last time). Second, their milk teas have a distinct, strong tea flavor (similar to Brew Tea) and not powdery or too milky. Third, they give you the option to pick black tea or green tea when ordering flavored milk teas, like taro for example, for people who have a preference (mine is usually green tea). Overall, I am very impressed with the quality of tea, the new food items like pork rice and curry rice, and most importantly I appreciate their 32 oz large cup."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a good friend of mine who actually showed me this place. He recommended the milk blend drink with caramel, boba, and egg pudding. it was honestly one of the best boba drinks i have had that was relatively \"plain\" milk tea. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and of course all the really cute cat decor. my friend and i played card games and overall it was a good experience. I would recomment this place to anyone! im still waiting to try their food. ( ? )"}
{"text":"The tea space is a really nice relaxing place to grab boba off the strip. This location is super cute and has adorable cat paintings for sale that cover the walls in cuteness. If you're a cat fan it will definitely be up your alley as they even have cat themed board games.   We thought the cat theme was super cute, but actually came for the boba. They had a decent variety of boba options. I ordered a fresh milk tea with boba and a chicken curry snack. Additional orders at our table included a mango juice, oolong milk tea, and a green tea as well as a popcorn shrimp dish that in total only cost around $40 dollars.   The reasonable prices for their drinks and the drink sizes really shocked us. Three of us ordered small drinks and my husband decided on the regular. The small drinks had to be at least 16-20 oz and the regular was huge and was probably around 32 oz in size. I did not order the 32 oz drink, but asked if I could grip the container and could barely get my hands around it. Basically come prepared to drink lots of tea if you visit this joint.   The house milk tea was made fresh to order and had a nice flavor and delicious honey boba. The honey boba was not overly sweet and was the perfect chewy consistency.   The curried chicken was so flavorful and included fresh carrot pieces, potatoes, onions, chicken, and a good portion of rice."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place and I was pleasantly surprised. Their reg size was HUGE and it was about $6 which isn't bad. I had the Okinawa coffee milk tea w/ coffee jelly and it was delicious. A tad to sweet for my taste so they were more than happy to just give me half the amount of sugar. The cashier was really nice even though he talked quite a bit fast lol there's a lot of cat decor on the wall and simple chairs/tables (nothing fru-fru which is good). I would definitely come back here again but I di hope they fix the temp inside the shop coz it felt a bit warm in there."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it!  We ordered the house milk tea with lychee jelly, mango lychee with lychee jelly, lemonade with aloe, and wintermelon with lychee and all were delicious.  Friendly services.  Nice and clean place."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop on our way back to Cali from Vegas. This place is tiny and narrow and when we got there, it was not even busy. After ordering and waiting, a ton of ppl from nowhere came in and the place was jam packed.    We ordered the following: 01.  Mango Green Tea - $3.66 - 3 Stars - Green Tea was bitter and dark, Mango syrup was a bit too sweet. It was just okay.  02.  House Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars - Smooth milk tea w/ Honey Boba.  I'm not a fan of Honey Bobas at all but the kids loved it.  03.  Okinawa Milk Tea - $3.66 - 4 Stars - Smooth and Creamy but we've had better in Cali. The portion of sweetness and tea was perfect. Do recommend always ordering \"Okinawa Mik\" if it is offered.  04.  Passion Fruit Black Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 3 Stars - Good Passion Fruit flavor, not too bitter or sweet.  05.  Oolong Milk Tea w/ Boba  - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars - Oolong tea is a better option if you're not into the dark or bitter teas. Tastes lighter and are smooth with Milk Teas.   LOCATION - In a tiny shopping plaza, tiny internal space. Depending on where you are on the street you have to make a U-turn to see it.   CUSTOMER SERVICE - Not the FRIENDLIEST or the FASTEST, but I'm used to Cali Tea Houses where the volumes of people are much higher.  We waited 20 minutes for our 5 drinks. Prices are decent for the cup size you get. It's the same price for the regular or large so why not just get the larger one right. The definitely can improve on the speed of getting the tea orders.   GOOD THINGS - They have a Stamp Card for frequent buyers so you can get free drinks. Pick one up if you are from Vegas.    VERDICT - Good teas for Vegas but we have so many amazing one in Cali that Cali Tea Houses are still my FAVE ones.  But when I'm in Vegas next, I'll stop by to get my stamp card punched."}
{"text":"Another new addition to the Vegas boba scene. Recently opened, Tea Space is sort of similar to Half and Half. The product they use is from Half and Half and the workers are ex-Half and Half boba shop workers. They claim to serve more tea-based drinks compare to other boba shops around.   Location is a little tricky. It's located on the north of Church's Chicken, and is next to L.A. insurance. Small plaza but is quiet so not hard to find a parking space. I was greeted with a warm welcome by two friendly staffs. Cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable, and was able to recommend few drinks for me based on what I was craving.   Drinks I have tried:  Wintermelon green tea. Also known as white gourd and can be made into a milk tea with a choice of green/black tea. Wintermelon here taste similar to the Lollicup version, but without the weird sugary aftertaste. I personally prefer Kung Fu Tea's version because the tea and whitegourd juice is well-balanced. 4/5   House milk green tea. Also known as jasmine milk tea. This is probably my most favorite drink here. Creaminess was on point and tea has a strong herbal taste which I enjoyed. It's not too milky so even though it is a milk tea, it was still a refreshing drink. 5/5  Green tea with sea salt. Sea salt foam is becoming the next big thing in boba scene. I believe there are only 2-3 boba shops in Vegas that offers sea salt cream and based on trying other places, sea salt here is probably the worst rendition I have had. It has this unpleasant buttery taste to it. Consistency is rather runny so unlike other sea salt cream I have had where the cream drizzle down, it will just mix with the drink with few shakes. Bad batch? They just opened so I'm sure they still have some kinks to work out. 2/5  Iced milk drink with brown sugar and hot honey boba. I expected the same quality as Half and Half where the drink itself has a crystal and icy texture. That was not the case. It was basically a milk slush that melted into a regular milk, and honey syrup from boba in addition to brown sugar was too much sweetness for me to handle. Very similar to wow milk from KFT, which is a milk based drink with no tea, and has boba marinated in red sugar. It is a decaf drink so good for late night boba craving. 3/5  Chocolate milk tea with black tea base. Black tea is strong and with the request of less sweetness, chocolate flavor was weak. If you like chocolate, I prefer their other drink called iced chocolate which is like a chocolate slush. If you do decide to stick with their chocolate milk tea, I would suggest getting chocolate milk tea with just regular sweetness and with green tea for more chocolate flavor. 3/5  Strawberry milk tea with green tea base. Surprisingly green tea was weak with a strong artificial strawberry syrup taste. Not too creamy which was nice but I would ask for less sweetness on this particular drink. 3/5  They marinate boba in honey. Sweet and more on the softer side. Sadly not as good as the boba from Half and Half. I wish it was warmer and had more chew like Half and Half.   Friendly staff, ample seating, decent drinks and stamp card. They have everything you can possibly ask for in a boba shop."}
{"text":"Another milk tea place in Chinatown. This one is fairly close to Kung Fu tea place.   As soon we walked in, the nice lady offered us menu.   We tried oolong milk tea, Jasmine milk tea, mango slush, and lychee iced tea. Price wise it's slightly higher than other tea places. The reason for that is their tea is superb and fresh quality. If you enjoy higher quality tea drinks then this is the place for you. Also, their boba was perfectly cooked.   It's a cute place to hangout. I didn't see any free wifi. They have stamp card but I'm out of town so I didn't take one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their strawberry yogurt drink. It's the perfect tang with sweetness. Their boba balls are soft too and their cup sizes for the drinks are big so you get your money's worth. The people who work here are nice and they always have recommendations if it's your first time. The place just has a cool vibe and the artwork on the wall is nice. It's a cool place to study and get some boba."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of talk about Tea Space aka the newest boba joint to hit the town. People have been comparing this place to Half and Half Tea House (for those who frequent the SoCal 626 area or are from there) and I can see why.   Like Half and Half, Tea Space includes honey boba for almost all their drinks. They offer pretty much the same types of drinks on their menu and even have very similar aesthetics as the SoCal joint.   I went with the iced milk with egg pudding, caramel, and honey boba. It was SUUUUPER SWEET but I'm not complaining, I prefer sweet drinks anyway. (However, you can always ask for less sweet.) Also, they give you a decent amount of caramel so make sure to mix your drink well or it'll taste as if you're just drinking cold milk. The honey boba was chewy and hot which made for a nice contrast against the drink. But the egg pudding was definitely the winner for me! It had a good consistency and the pudding + iced milk combo felt like a matchmade in heaven in my mouth. Definitely recommend adding egg pudding to your drink whether you order the milk tea or the iced milk. SO BOMB.   My only thing is with the cups. Yeah, the size portions ARE HUGE but the cups aren't the most convenient with drinks that require a lot of mixing since they're capped off with a plastic tops and the straw can only do so much. Maybe if they're plastic sealed? Otherwise, definitely will be back to try their other drinks! ^______^"}
{"text":"Cats Everywhere!!    I guess I'm letting the cat out of the bag with this one.  They sure love cats at Tea Space.  It's obvious that the owner loves cats.  First of all, check out his car.  His license plate says \"I Love Cat\".  Second, Tea Space is located on Spring Mountain and DeCATur.  See the coincidence.  And if that isn't enough, then check out the décor.  Cat's everywhere!!  You cat miss it.  You'll meet Jazz the King Cat at the front counter.  He's a cat statue dressed like a king chillin' like a villain.  He's obviously the Alpha Cat.  Then there's the posters on the wall.  You'll find Harry Potter the Cat, Thor the Cat, Catman, and my favorite, Cat-Tain America.  I didn't get the names of the owner or employees.  But I have to admit, they are a couple of cool cats.   As for their menu, it's pretty simple and basic.  They serve fresh teas, milk teas, iced coffees, milk smoothies, yogurt drinks, ice soy milk drinks, and slush drinks.  Yes, the menu has a lot of \"cat\"egories.  Toppings include honey boba, egg pudding lychee, jellies, green & red bean, taro, honey, and sea salt.  I had the coffee milk tea with boba.  It was delish and hit the spot.  We also had a free sneak peek of their grass jelly with sea salt.  Four words...You cat deny it.  Sorry, cat help it.  I can't catain myself.  It was good and mixed well with my coffee milk tea. Take my advice and ask for the grass jelly.  It would be a \"cat\"astrophe if you didn't.  As for me, I had a huge serving of boba and can barely move.  I'm almost \"cat\"atonic.  Time for a cat nap, so I'll end it my review now.  My final thoughts....iced milk tea with boba on a hot summer day in Las Vegas equals purrfection.  2016 Yelp Review #35"}
{"text":"This is my second time here :) Last time when I came, I had their mini hotpot. It was really tasty. I had their jasmine milk tea with boba (I have it again this time:). My favorite thing about this place is their giant to go cup :) really convenient and it fit in the cup holder! And they finally have popcorn chicken now!! And many more snacks which is really nice! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Average boba place but good customer service! I got the rose black milk tea and my boyfriend got the jasmine green tea. You can customize the level of sweetness and ice to your preference. Beware of sizing, the have a small and a regular size. The small size is your typical size whereas regular is the upgraded size. Nice try trying to up-sell me if I wasn't paying attention..."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and cozy. I original want to go to kungfu tea next door but they always packed.So i settle myself in Tea Space and surprisingly it really good. I ordered Hokkaido Smoothies and it tastes really good. The only downside is (*Dear Owner,i hope you will read this one*) . The tea space lacks of the atmosphere,and too quiet in there. I hope in the future, you guys can turn some music on,some TV show, some games or toys or something to entertain the customer,make them want to sit down.that way,your shop will feel more lively,not too empty."}
{"text":"I tried their yogurt green tea for the first time and it was soooo bitter. However the worker came by n changed it completely for free! These guys are awesome man! And they walk around and check up on you even tho its just a boba shop. When boba shops run their business better than 5 star restaurants... This place is great!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that we finally have good boba near the intersection of Spring Mountain and Decatur.  (Call the police. That's definitely shots fired.)  Tea Space is a new addition to the burgeoning Las Vegas bubble tea scene, and I managed to find the time to try it despite stuffing myself on a late dinner at one of the many great nearby restaurants. I actually missed them the first time because the name on their sign didn't stand out, but they're in that tiny strip mall on Decatur next to the foot spa.  The cashier presented a paper booklet menu to me when I first entered. They don't have a menu board (yet). I saw options for house green milk tea and fresh green milk tea and inquired about the difference. The former uses creamer, whereas the latter has actual milk. I leapt at the opportunity for real dairy and got the 32 oz \"regular\" size ($0.99 on top of the $3.66 tea price) and the honey boba ($0.50). I thought it was 24 oz at first, but i checked the bottom of the plastic cup. It's actually 8 oz larger than what most places call a \"large.\" The more the merrier, right?  They prepared my order in a reasonable amount of time and told me to let them know if I needed any adjustments. If they indeed hold to this policy, that's pretty awesome. I'd forgotten to ask for a sugar or ice adjustment, but it tasted fine as it was, and I wasn't planning to linger.  The green tea and milk flavors were both easily distinguished, and the honey boba was indeed as hot as they warned me. They feel a little softer than other popular local shops' pearls (perhaps due to temperature), but they have the bite that you can and must expect. These pearls kinda remind me of No. 1 Boba Tea's, except that here they do have honey flavor and don't get overcooked.   I didn't linger inside for long, but the seating area feels surprisingly roomy and is fairly inviting even if it's a little dark. The register and the window table made the ordering line a bit physically uncomfortable. They have a buy 10 get $3.66 off card, so pricing is very comparable to other places.  I'll be back to Tea Space soon to try more of their menu, and hopefully I'll remember to make adjustments. I've gotta try the sea salt cream (although one reviewer found it distasteful), the coffee, and some of the other tea flavors. This initial 4* rating is due for an upgrade if the adjustments are worthwhile and the quality stays consistent.  [QUICK UPDATE 6/8/16: Boba quality control tightened up. Tonight, it was very al dente, which I like. As for the longan fresh milk tea, I probably wouldn't have guessed longan for a while in a blind taste test. I guess they use canned or rehydrated diced pieces of the fruit, and perhaps the milk and honey (from the honey boba) obscured the flavor a bit.]"}
{"text":"The decor is really cute, and their regular size for drinks is huge. I also really enjoyed their traditional pork bowl. The parking lot is small, but I haven't had any trouble finding a space. Service is friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to study spot when I'm sick of campus, however it's not exactly quiet nor is it well lit so it gets hard to focus sometimes, but on the rare occasions there aren't that many people, I enjoy the ambiance of this place!  All of the teas I've tried are delicious and I like that you can add Oreo to any of them. My favorite so far is the lavender black milk tea!!!! The food isn't bad as well! So far I've had the popcorn chicken, popcorn shrimp, takoyaki, and one of their hot pots. (Side note, if you wanted to share a hotspot, it's an additional 5 bucks - doesn't make any sense to me) All we're reasonably priced and had good flavor!  Overall, I just wish some people had more courtesy for others studying, but you can't blame them! Haha but like I said, this is one of my go tos for studying if you get tired of campus libraries and food options :)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite tea place!! It's actually across the street from Kung fu tea, so I think it gets outshined a lot, which really is a shame because the tea and the service here is the best! The man I assume is the owner is so nice and considerate, and is genuinely concerned with whether or not you like your drink! And plus, the yogurt drinks here are the best. If you haven't been here yet, you're definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"What an awesome find! Cat themed, amazing drinks in huge sizes I think 20 oz or 32oz, and great service. It's not just a tea place. They do dessert and food as well! We stayed for hours because it was so welcoming. Their boba is freshly made and their attention to detail is wonderful.  This was my first time here and I'll be back again. I had almond jasmine iced tea with lychee jelly, peanut butter toast, and then we tried the popcorn chicken and sweet potato fries. It was all excellent."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to come here regularly, but they have corrupt business practices that make no sense. I ordered a hot pot for my girlfriend and I but wasn't made aware that it was required to buy a drink with it. I was also not made aware that there was a $5 charge to share the food I purchased. Obviously it's understandable to charge for sharing AYCE but this was food that I already purchased. The portions are for sharing so why add hidden fees? I also didn't care for how the manager treated us. We felt like they wanted us to leave. Not coming back. Hope the 5 dollar charge was worth all of our business lmaoooooo"}
{"text":"Recently, the times I've been to Teaspace it could be crowded so it'll be difficult to find seating or sometimes people can be quiet loud in the store. Still, I really enjoyed the decoration of the place.  It felt like a Steampunk kind of vibe with the theme being cats.  I really enjoyed their Matcha Green Tea, it tasted fresh and creamy the first time I taste it, the next time I went it tasted different like more bitter the sweet.  The staff are nice.  They have board games so you can play with friends while drinking your boba or eating a snack.  They have cute artwork on their wall."}
{"text":"Fair prices, yummy tea, and nice people.   Compared to other Vegas boba places, Tea Space has better prices, a bigger menu (including food), an easier parking lot, and more seating."}
{"text":"A really nice hole in the wall hidden gem in Chinatown. You wouldn't think much of the exterior of the place, but the interior is very rustic, giving a very down to earth environment. The employees are always more than eager to accommodate customers with a welcoming in house experience. There is a very wide variety of drinks offered here, and they offer aloe as a topping! I've never tried that before and I fell I love with it. Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"Best boba place in Vegas! I finally found a place that uses fresh taro in their milk tea and they have bomb popcorn chicken too!"}
{"text":"generous sizing and the flavor is just right. I got the almond milk tea and it's sweet unlike some other places around vegas where they dilute it so much with milk. It had the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I have been avidly drinking milk teas all over town and out of town too, and still this place managed to offer something different. Their milk tea has a deep Oolong taste, with a somewhat spicy flavor, which I usually dislike, except that this one was pretty good! I was however not a fan of their loose propane stovetops placed on top of pretty narrow table in a pretty narrow space. I am not a city safety inspector, but it seems kinda risky. Also the owner reserves the best table for... himself! Not a great idea in a place with less than ten tables."}
{"text":"Boyfriend actually discovered this place, upon driving home from work. Being a self-proclaimed Boba Tea aficionado, I am always a bit hesitant to try new places. This place is located in a small plaza on the corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur caddy corner to Church's Chicken. Super friendly staff! Cute cat decor and quaint set up. They have a \"Top 10\" most ordered drink menu, which we ordered from. I ordered the Hokkaido Milk Tea w/boba. The flavor was similar to the White Rabbit candy! So delicious! & let's not forget about THE BOBA! So fresh and chewy, almost melt in your mouth! Made with honey and brown sugar. Honestly the best boba I have ever had. I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu. Great job Tea Space!!"}
{"text":"Love the service & love their boba.  Would definitely go back.  I had the pistachio slush with boba & it sure is something I'd order again."}
{"text":"I don't know which I loved more: the boba, or the insane amount of feline decor scattered all over the shop.  This place was fantastic for a quick boba break after a big lunch. Like their name implies, this is a space to come in, relax, and drink (milk) tea. All of our beverages were made fresh and used natural ingredients, not flavored powder some other chain boba shops would use.  My Longan Milk Tea was great. When it was first brought out, you could see the different layers of foam, tea, and kelly. After a bit of mixing, the drink was ready to be consumed. I could actually taste the tea in my drink, so a big thumbs up to Tea Space for knowing how to do boba well. My friends' drinks were all fantastic as well. Beware, sweet means sweet, so don't be afraid to lower the sugar content if you'd like.  I also found it amusing how their stamp card offers $3.66 off a drink, instead of outwright receiving a free beverage. While most drinks are that price, be sure to bring loose change cause that tax can be unpredictable!  Parking is plentiful inside their private lot."}
{"text":"Excellent juicy chewy boba balls ! I usually get the black milk tea w boba less sweet and it's always made well. The staff are always extremely friendly and accommodating for sweetness levels and customer satisfaction. I think the gentlemen making the drinks must be the owners and they always ask  if the drinks are made to our liking and if we want to change the drinks just let them know. I haven't ever been to a tea shop this courteous ! Thank you all !"}
{"text":"Had the Wintermelon Coffee with Rose Boba.  This boba is phenomenal and only available this holiday season!  Has a nice floral fragrance and flavor.  Perfect size, sweetness, and texture!  Rivals Brew Tea Bar's boba!  This place has some cool cat-themed card games as well.  Exceptional customer service!  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some boba, so we decided to try Tea Space after hearing the positive reviews from friends. As we entered the shop we were greeted with a warm smile and menu from Alvin C. He let us sample a couple toppings that we were curious about, he was patient with our questions, and attended to us when we were seated. Boba was fresh, warm, and had a perfect consistency. Flavors were well balanced and had a true tea flavor. We also got to try the Hokkaido smoothie! I would have never tried it if it weren't for the great recommendation from Alvin and we definitely will come back for it again! Thank you Alvin for the great customer service and friendliness!"}
{"text":"First timer review, the cashier was friendly, he gave us a small take out menu of their drinks.  I got a wintermelon green tea and I was surprise how good it was and not to mention their regular size is like an XL like a venti from Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Base on the pictures and reviews at Yelp, the cat figurines, art and paintings seem so big, but in reality they are just on one single wall. One wall with all the cat pictures. I actually went here just to see them because my boyfriend loves cats lol.   Anyway, as for the boba... Its good I can say. For all the bobas I went to, this one is around in the middle.."}
{"text":"My family and I went here yesterday, we spent $30 on drinks and $60 on food. The owner is greedy and wanted to charge us more for sharing a hot pot. This isn't a buffet so why would people need to pay more to share food. He was rude about it, walked back and forth and gave us a dirty look. All this because we wanted to share food. I hope they go out of business for being greedy, since there's many more amazing places around there. We only went here because the place we wanted to try was closed. Their tea are diluted as heck, that's why they offer a bigger cup. It's to make people think they're getting more for their bucks. Definitely won't come back here and don't recommend any true boba/tea lovers to try them."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite boba spots and I would come here frequently when it first opened since I love the fact you can taste the tea over the milk and it is not powdery like Kung Fu. However I visited recently and I think the quality went down. I got the jasmine milk tea with grass jelly and my friend got the iced blended wintermelon tea and both drinks just tasted like watery milk. No tea flavor whatsoever. All we could taste was the toppings. They had a promotional thing going on where they discontinued their regular honey boba for a rose boba for the holidays. I wish they still offered the honey boba as well because not a lot of people were a fan of the rose boba. We also got the popcorn chicken which was served in a cute little yellow pan. It was tasty but we had to wait awhile until it finally came."}
{"text":"I really liked Tea Space! There were many interesting combinations of flavors available.  I got an almond green tea with fresh milk and honey boba.  The boba was surprisingly warm and fresh.  I really enjoyed it!  The staff recommended fresh milk with my tea, which I was happy to try something new!  I would like to try the matcha milk tea next.  I was very happy to try something new and refreshing.  The atmosphere is very quaint too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never heard of this place. I go to California often and a good boba shop there is called \"half and half\" where they have a super good ice milk drink. I have been looking for a place in Vegas that has the same drink. The #2 is the drink I have been looking for.  There are many boba places in Vegas and especially in China town, this place does a good job standing out from the rest. I have found my new favorite place to get tea in China town. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It's a new Taiwanese Boba Tea shop in Vegas, and the owner came from LA who is very experienced in making Boba drinks. I like the Coffee Milk Tea and Lemon with honey there. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with yummy food and drinks. Food here definitely reminds me of night market food in Taiwan. Especially like the popcorn fried chicken. The honey boba is really good too. Great location. Great service"}
{"text":"This is the best tea place in town. Their price and portion are way better than other tea places. It may not be a popular location but it's very close to the Roku/Monta Ramen plaza and it's definitely worth a little walk/drive to check it out. My favorites are their green teas and oolong teas. Peach mango oolong tea is delicious and not too sweet. Their dumplings are surprisingly good as well.  Most importantly if you are a cat/art lover like me, you will love all the cute cat decors and arts on the wall. There are art prints, original arts and handmade crafts available for purchase as well."}
{"text":"If you think that it's a real tea place you are deeply mistaken. There is no variety of black, green, white teas. Instead they bring you a paper cup of a super strong and sweet premade tea. The atmosphere is nice and the people are nice too though."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!  Tis cozy! Adorable all around! There is kawaii super duper soft plushies to squeeze lolThey were playing what I believe was Asian J pop!  Anddd the girl was sooo friendly!  When I asked her for her recommendations she was patient,  kind and she elaborated a lot. There is also many fun games to play.  I will be coming back many many times!  ()"}
{"text":"Great, fun little place with a lot of character. Have some tea, have some good food, and play a game or two. I had the regular Taro Boba with soy milk and its was gigantic!!! Lol I totally wasn't expecting a regular size drink to be as big is it was!  I love taro and this didn't disappoint. The popcorn chicken is amazing!!  Perfectly crunchy with skins and all. Flavor is very savory with curry and other spices. I am usually the type that likes to have a sauce but I really didn't miss it with all the flavor that was going on. Will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"This place is honestly one of my favorite places now.   I highly recommend the Okinawa specialty milk tea with boba! Their Okinawa ice coffee is delicious as well.  Heads up they also sell hot pot and brick toast. In case you may wonder, brick toast and honey toast are two different things. Brick honey toast is just the slice of bread versus the whole loaf of bread in a honey toast. Seats here are sparse ( still more seats than Kung fu tea thank goodness!)   It gets a bit busier at night and there's hardly parking out in the lot so be aware as I've been here at 10 and they've run out of boba before...horrific I know! Also make sure to get a punch card.   Their \"normal\" size is pretty big AND they have light bulb cups for an additional 99 cents now!!!!!! So cute!"}
{"text":"What I do really enjoy about this location is that the cashier are super friendly. the sizes are very unique and come in either a normal or small. Keep note the normal is 24 ounces of fluid's.  When I walked in the drink menu was overwhelming. I asked the cashier what they enjoy and recommended and I was told to go with the Hokkaido with grass jelly! By far their recommendation was on point and I was very satisfied. The tea flavor was actually there and didn't taste completely unauthentic or powered. Overall a cool place to come and hangout, they also had games to play and pass the time with."}
{"text":"Warm welcome with happy faces. The owner I believe suggested me the Okinawa coffee with sea salt cream and I been hooked on it every since! I try different drinks but the Okinawa is my number one."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden in a tiny strip mall of stores in with a tiny parking lot.  Walking inside and you're greeted with a very pleasant cat themed interior.  The staff is pretty nice and very accommodating.  I ordered a couple of simple milk teas with boba (Green/Black).  They were pretty good, but the green tea was burned and very bitter.  I know they would have replaced it if we asked but decided not to bother them."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Has a nice atmosphere and tasty drinks. I've tried the jasmine tea latte and the okinawa latte and both are delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place since they have mini hot pot now. The Hot Pot came in an individual size. And it's about $10 per pot. however you are required to purchase a Boba drink if you want the hotpot. The bill came out to be about $15. I did not want the boba drink at that time but was told that I needed to. So I decided to order one since I wanted to try the hot pot. The Hot Pot soup was to bland and they give you a few thin slices of beef with an individual vegetables. I was not happy with the result."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to grab some boba.  We found out that they also do mini hot pots.  Their broths are so good and the amount of food they give you really do fill you up.  Not only was the hot pot amazing, but their boba is too.   It wasn't even expensive at all.  One mini hot pot is $9.99.  I forgot how much boba was, but I think it was less than $5 for sure.  Definitely a place you should check out!"}
{"text":"Their \"regular\" size is actually quite big which I LOVE. Got a winter melon milk tea with sea salt. The honey Boba is nice a soft, and has a sweetness to it. You won't be disappointed. Definitely will be my go to boba place while I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here after having ramen across the street. A very nicely spaced, dimmed, little boba shop. They had drinks along with snacks as well!!  The girl who worked in the front was very kind and patient with me when it came to ordering my drink. I'm very picky when it comes to boba because although I love milk tea, I am still getting used to all the different kinds because not all the places taste the same.  I ended up getting a regular milk tea with sea cream and boba - extra sweet. The drink was so good!! I loved it. Probably one of my favorite sea salt drinks I've ever had. Since it was my first boba place I've tried in Vegas that is new to me, it definitely hit the spot. The sea salt was also sweet. Yummmm.."}
{"text":"An excellent boba place with a cat theme (I'm a cat person).  The servings are HUGE.  The tea is good.  Service is great.  I haven't tried the food yet, but it looked good when I've observed other customers eating.    BTW much of the art is for sale and they also have Japanese snacks."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! You can either order to-go or order-in for boba tea. This gives it a nice, cafe-like vibe. There's also food available here and it smelled super delicious.   The service is quick-paced and everyone is super friendly.   I ordered the lavender milk tea, but I feel the milk may have overpowered the tea.   Overall, I would come back."}
{"text":"Great warm chewy honey boba, but the tea itself was meh. I ordered the jasmine milk tea with sea salt crema and I wasn't a fan of the crema flavor (good texture, bad flavor), and the tea flavor and strength was lackluster.   Highlights: * Offer two sizes: regular (20 oz) or large (36 oz I think!) * Serve food too - toast, hot pot, etc. * Variety of teas including ice milk, fruit teas with dairy and non-dairy creamer. * Cozy spot, no outlets in sight. Park out front.  * Super friendly service, loyalty cards available."}
{"text":"I missed my turn and drove right past this place on my first visit. It's literally right by Church's Chicken on the Decatur side. There's plenty of parking and service is quick.   They only have 2 sizes, small and regular. The regular was pretty big, not that I'm complaining. I just never thought a day would come where I couldn't finish my boba drink. I am the type to slurp up every last tapioca ball. \"No boba left behind\" is what I always say. Maybe I was already too full from dinner but I really couldn't finish my drink.   The boba is warm, soft, and chewy. The tea drinks have a more prominent tea flavor than most other places, which I really like. I've had the kumquat juice, kumquat lemonade, wintermelon black tea, and lychee green tea with lychee jelly. No complaints. Everything was good, but the service is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"First time here. When I walked in, the place was decorated nicely and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The person who assisted me and my husbands questions about their menu was very nice and patient and helpful. We were provided samples of the toppings and jellies. We really appreciated that. I ordered a regular honey green tea with aloe vera and it was very refreshing. My daughter got a milk tea boba. I Iove how the regular size is very large. Will definitely come back and recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Workers are always friendly and drinks are delicious. Their boba is probably one of the best in Vegas- but don't skimp out on the apple or lychee jelly cause those are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Fantastic team of individuals! One the employee was really helpful and explained mines and my fiancé's questions on their flavors on the menu. Very attentive and very hospitable! I came in for my first time today and definitely would recommend others to try out this boba shop Forsure! Keep up the good work and you'll definitely see more of me!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I got the honey green tea and milk green tea with lychee and they were both made to perfection! Not artificial tasting or too sweet :) not from here but will be back when in the area. Also good pricing for what you get."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and looking at my photos, the size have definitely gotten smaller. Am I right or just imagining things?    I ordered the tasty grass drink which is ice blended milk with brown sugar, honey boba and grass jelly. I ordered it with half sugar but it was still very sweet will go less next time. The problem with the ice blended drinks is that all the sugar is on the bottom. You need to mix it and usually you just shake your boba upside down and let the syrupy goodness flow all over. However, this cup came with a lid and wasn't sealed so it was a bit hard to get the drink to taste evenly throughout. I was stirring with my straw. The boba was nice and chewy and the grass jelly was great. It's denser than most places which I like so you get huge chunks of it.   My friend ordered the winter melon drink with half sugar as well. Compared to mine, his was not sweet at all. I would rather have less sweet than super sweet. But 1/2 sugar varies with each drink I guess. I think I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is really all about..I got the taro boba blended since they said that they use real chunks of taro for that drink.. it was watered down and the flavor was just not there.. my husband got the Hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream (extra $.99) and they ask if you want a larger size (which he did) and it is quite substantial ($.99 more) however he didn't quite like the taste as well.. if you want good boba tea, stick with Brew Tea Bar on rainbow..it's always on point and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great service, nice chill place to relax at and play some card/board games."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you just wanna sit and stay for hours. You don't expect much from the outside, but when walking in, it's such a clean, vibrant area with plenty of seats and decor. Not to mention the menu has a million options for whatever you're craving. Definitely check it out!!!"}
{"text":"A very lovely spot to go for a tapioca tea. You can ask for half sugar and it taste just as not sweet as I expected.  The pudding with milk and tapioca is good.  Nice place to go for a drink in summer time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"After spending almost $100 the owner had the audacity to upcharge us for sharing our food. We had to ask for more syrup in our milk teas since they were being stingy with it. The only positive thing about this place is the cat themed decor. There are way too many milk tea shops for them to go about their service like this."}
{"text":"I like that there aren't very long lines here. Drinks are well priced and the larger size is not much more than a small size. It is hot and humid inside the store."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is my new go to boba spot on Spring Mountain, since I don't care much for the other choices nearby.  A good sign is that their boba (tapioca balls, pearls) is made well here. I like the way their menu is organized and it tells you which drinks are caffeine free or dairy free. The best drink I've had here is the Okinawa coffee, which had a strong coffee flavor with a brown sugar base. The winter melon smoothie is great for those who want the winter melon flavor without the caffeine. Personal preference, I like winter melon tea or milk teas, so I'll have to try those next time! The longan fresh milk had real bits of longan and it was not that sweet of a drink.  The Hokkaido smoothie tasted good, but it had a Hokkaido taste I was not familiar with. I was getting coconut undertones with this drink.  The interior is cute and comfortable with cat decor everywhere! ***3.75 overall :)  *****Yelp 2016 100 challenge***** 29/100"}
{"text":"Wonderful tea shop!! I ordered a Matcha milk tea. It was the best matcha I've ever ordered anywhere! The atmosphere was nice and cute with lots of cat themed decor. Employees were very very nice. I wish I had a Tea Space in my state! I would go there a lot!"}
{"text":"The decoration of this cafe gives you a \" Warm Welcome\". If you like Ice Milk Drink w/ pudding and honey boba, this is the place you should go.  Great customer service. Can't wait they have some Taiwanese snacks like popcorn chicken or other Taiwanese dishes.  You definitely need to stop by if you are around the area and get a cup of the drink"}
{"text":"One of my favorite boba shops! Staff is always friendly and helpful, and their Rose milk tea is probably the best I've had"}
{"text":"Hands Down THE BEST BOBA IN VEGAS!! I'm from SoCal and not just anywhere in SoCal , I'm from SGV so I'm quiet the boba connoisseur. I visit Vegas often and I've tried every place here. No where was even close to being up to par with SGV. Until now.... For people who can't or don't want caffeine MUST TRY winter melon milk tea, it's heaven. The passion fruit green tea is one of the best I've tried, and the icy milk drink is up there with my favorite place (Half n Half) . Thank you owner of this place for opening and getting things right!"}
{"text":"The tea is so good! We had the black milk tea and green tea latte (cheese form). Both of them are tealicious! The place is cozy and nice! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely great! They checked up on me twice to make sure that my drink was good for my taste and even offered to adjust it if I wanted it sweeter. I tried the caramel green milk tea with boba and was not disappointed! It takes a little while for the drinks to come out, but definitely worth the wait. The cat drawings everywhere were also a plus for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I usually order to-go with my mom  (we both get the Hokkaido milk tea and it's absolutely AMAZING), but I never got a chance to actually sit down and take it all in until yesterday. I had been staring at their food menu for quite some time and decides to try it out with my boyfriend. We were not disappointed! We ordered three things: spicy dumpling soup, takoyaki, and popcorn chicken rice. We also ordered Okinawa milk tea and Jasmine Green tea. WOW. I'm a huge fan of takoyaki and this takoyaki is definitely high on my list of good takoyaki. The spicy dumpling soup was fantastic, too. The broth was really good with the chili oil, and the dumplings had a nice crunch from the veggies they had inside with the meat. My all time favorite thing though was the popcorn chicken rice. We had to ask them for it a second time because the first guy we ordered from never put our order in, but it was well worth the wait. We ordered it spicy and the chicken was delicious. The coating they had on it did not take away from the actual meat; I hate it when there's more breading than actual meat but they made this the right way! The rice had some meat and a little bit of sauce that had soaked into it and it was fantastic. They also had some corn, collard greens and cooked cabbage on the plate. I don't usually go for veggies, but whatever sauce they cooked the cabbage in made devour the whole thing. The drinks really hit the spot and came in these really nice looking containers. Our drinks stayed pretty cold, even as we were waiting on the popcorn chicken rice.  The decor is pretty chic and the atmosphere is super chill. They also have artwork for purchase lined up on the walls which I really enjoyed. This has turned out to be my new favorite place to grab a bite and just chit-chat. My boyfriend and I ended up staying there for over an hour. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a great space to talk and play games with your friends!! The food was so good and the hosts and service was very helpful and sweet! The artwork on the walls and the way everything was set up made it feel very homie and comfortable I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Really weird hours so it came off to a first bad impression.  Walked in on a Tuesday at 6:15pm - .. place is closed lol. Their hours are on Tuesday 12p-6p. Was irritated afterwards and not sure if I want to try them out anymore."}
{"text":"The boba is good, the cat decorations are cute, and the customer service is great, but the black milk tea, green milk tea, and honey plum black tea we got were absolutely horrible. The black milk tea tasted like burnt paper. Burnt paper!! It reminded me of the paper my family would burn for the dead.. D: The green milk tea tasted very watered down, and there wasn't even ice in the drink. We couldn't get a hint of the black tea in the honey plum black tea.  It wouldn't have been so bad if the total didn't come out to over $17 for the three drinks. $17!! So expensive! I don't even pay that much in Irvine, and everything is expensive there!   I should've just stuck to KungFu tea across the street. Never again."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today after seeing all the reviews and rave. It's not in a good part of town, but on the inside it's completely different. Super cozy and homey. I tried the wintermelon milk tea with boba  the regular size is huge and it was love at first sip :)"}
{"text":"Came here one night with my husband and his friend to get some popcorn chicken and boba!  When you walk in, you'll notice that the place is cat themed. They have so many cute drawings on the wall and cute plushies on the seats!   We got an order of their popcorn chicken in medium spicy. I decided to go with their lychee black tea while my husband got their almond milk tea. I ordered my tea half sweet with less ice since I don't like my teas too sweet. The waiter warned me that since it's half sweet, it also means that it's half flavor. If I don't like how light it is, they can always add to it.   But honestly, I don't think it would help for me to add sweetness to it because it'll just be a lychee drink. My drink tasted really watered down and had barely any tea flavor. It was quite disappointing. My husband's almond milk tea drink also tasted watered down.   The popcorn chicken however was pretty good. A medium spicy may be a bit too spicy for people who can't eat too much spice. The pieces were pretty big too .. but my first bite was a piece of fat haha!  Decent place for a snack. I probably wouldn't get their tea again though. Haha."}
{"text":"the taro tea slush wasn't as tasty as I thought, but it was still good don't get me wrong.. it was about a 15 min wait for two of those which is a tad bit long /: other than that the space is small but very comfortable for work or studying, very kind staff (:"}
{"text":"I usually don't get boba in Vegas but afterwards small bowl of pho we decided to stop by this slightly out of sight tea shop. It was clean and the quality of the drinks was similar to the boba tea shops we have in SoCal. I tried just the milk tea and it was sweet but not too sweet and the boba was hot and chewy. I was craving a snack like popcorn chicken but they don't have a kitchen open yet which was unfortunate. Would stop by again."}
{"text":"Nice cozy boba tea house with great customer service and they use liquid brown sugar for their sweetener and you can adjust to taste by telling them how a sweet you want it. They also sell food too like fried rice, fried finger foods."}
{"text":"My favorite boba place! (Even though it's overly decorated with cat decor/ pictures. I hate cats) The employees are always so nice! My favorite drink..... Peach Black Milk Tea with Boba and Lychee Jelly!!"}
{"text":"Addicted to their tea! Love their okinawa milk tea with boba & sea salt latte topping. The quality of their teas are great. The biggest size (which is their regular size) is huge! No complaints there cause I always have some to save for later. Very clean inside & great customer service. The only thing is the sign is kind of hard to read if you are trying to find it for the first time. It would be easier to find if the sign had bold black letters so it pops out. It is right on Decatur & Spring Mountain near Churches chicken. Must have when I'm in the area. I've been coming here instead of anything else in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Appealing decor, fast service, and very friendly owners. Prices are very good and you can get a super large size as a regular. They also give stamp cards which is a bonus.  great to come here to chill with friends or just study. Definitely a new spot to come to and try out if your around the area. They have a wide variety of drinks on there menu and they give great recommendations if your trying for the first time, from tangy to sweet."}
{"text":"I come here specifically for their milk teas with rose boba and popcorn chicken. They have nice seating areas and a good place to hang out with friends. Workers are friendly and helpful. Haven't tried their hot pot but or other food in their menu. Will recommend it to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and good variety of teas nice atmosphere I stopped and got a couple of times he's really enjoyed them"}
{"text":"I love finding places like this... Cute hidden gems that are still untouched. Almost like an A-list celebrity who hasn't hit stardom just yet. Although I don't think this place will lose its touch of reality or appeal. Staff is really nice, decor is adorable and environment is peaceful. Great place to hang out with friends or to come to study. Ordered an Okinawa milk tea with boba and a green milk tea with boba and pudding. Asked for both to be light sweet and both were delicious! Tea tasted great, boba and pudding were very fresh, and the drinks were super refreshing! I would definitely come back here and avoid the craziness of Kung fu tea. 10 stars for the cute cat decor!"}
{"text":"Not a tea/boba person but I can only imagine if you are then you would love this place.   I just found the drinks to be super sweet and not really a fan of the winter melon.  It's cool based on the concept alone and I can respect that.."}
{"text":"Worth it! Tastes as good as those fancy places that charges you wayyyyy more. Clean and good customer service. Definitely coming back when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"The staff member who took my order was very friendly and my order didn't take too long. I got the Hokkaido milk tea with honey boba and I really wanted to like it but compared to another tea place I frequent, it didn't taste quite as good. But the honey boba was delicious served warm and the texture was almost perfect and I would have to say my favorite boba in town. I will be back to try the other menu items.   Don't get the taro milk tea. It was very disappointing. It was very gritty and just tasted like watered down milk with no taro"}
{"text":"Tea space is my new favorite spot. I usually go to kung fu. The last time I went here, I ordered rose milk tea with egg pudding. It was delicious! Too bad they don't have coffee jelly. Their small size is 20oz so you're getting your money's worth! (:"}
{"text":"Heard my friend talking about tea space so I decided to give it a try. It's in a quiet little area behind church's chicken, it can be hard to miss as it blends in with the other buildings.  There was no one in there when I arrived so you can determine if that's a good or bad thing.   The layout in there is pretty similar to Kung fu tea. You see the counter as soon as you walk in and to the left are some bench seats, chairs, and tables. The decor is pretty simple with a few pieces of art on the wall.   I decided to go with the Hokkaido milk tea (3.66) with egg pudding (.50) and sea salt latte (.99) and they charge another .99 for it to be a \"regular\" size which is gigantic compared to other places. I would consider it an XL size.   It pretty good, not too sweet but not watered down, and was made fairly quickly. I didn't get any boba this time so I can't provide any input on that. Maybe next time! There were a lot of drinks I've never heard of so I'll definitely be back! They even provided me with a stamp card for 3.66 off after 10 stamps."}
{"text":"The first time I tried tea space I wasn't super super fond. But I gave it another try and since then I've been hooked. My favorite milk teas are the caramel and hokkaido. Their boba is some of the best i've tasted and they give you a bunch of it too!  I also like their peach black tea and I love getting that with aloe jelly.  But the real winner for me is the condensed milk brick toast. I can't come here without getting it and I can't go longer than a week without it. Save me! LOL"}
{"text":"Located by the Church's Chicken right across from the Kung Fu Tea plaza, this place definitely has some competition. I've been coming here since they first opened and I can say that they have improved a lot. They even have food now too! I'm not a big fan of the milk teas that I've tried, but their fruity stuff is definitely my favorite! I tried their jasmine tea-latte with sea salt and it was delicious! Their boba is also a good consistency as well but I like opting for lychee jelly instead sometimes too. Their sizes can be confusing at times since the larger one is called regular so make sure to keep an eye out on that when ordering. They also offer stamp cards which is great but a little disheartening when I realize I've filled out so many. The staff is very accommodating, always making sure that our drinks are to our liking and if not, they offer to adjust it for you. Drinks come out at a pretty fast pace even if there's a line. Overall, great place. Good atmosphere and good drinks, just a small place."}
{"text":"It's not in too great of a location, but the inside looks much more welcoming than the outside. I ordered a small iced wintermelon green tea less sweetened, and a friend had the regular iced lavender green milk tea with boba. The wintermelon green tea was great, very refreshing. I'd say the lavender milk tea was a bit weak, a little too much milk and not enough of a lavender flavor. But on the plus side, the drink portions are plenty. If you are familiar with KFT, a small size here at Tea Space would be the same as a medium at Kung Fu, and a regular a large. Although having a large-sized regular is a good deal, the regular sized lavender milk tea wasn't cold enough because the ice would remain at the top of such a tall cup.. They have a stamp card for a free drink after ten. The staff is very friendly and service is good. There is an art wall on the interior where local artists have displayed art (mostly of cats) for sell. Great idea, it not only benefits and supports local artists, but also the cafe and its interior decorations. Would definitely go back with my stamp card and try more drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and milk tea was made strong and not so sweet. Just the way I like it :)"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite milk tea/boba spot in Chinatown!   For some reason it's hard for me to really like any of the boba shops around this area; Kung Fu Tea has lost my interest and it was time for a change of \"space\" (heh, get it!?).   But Tea Space is now my go to, especially when I'm craving their Lavender Milk Tea - sooo good! The lavender isn't overpowering which I really enjoy and it's very refreshing. I also love how their regular size is basically an XL 32oz just for 99 cents more!   Their menu is vast - they have a variety of milk teas (made with non-dairy powder) with a choice of black/jasmine/oolong as your base, fresh milk tea (made with whole milk), slushes, lattes, toppings, and also lots of different food items to snack on while you enjoy your drink.   I also like how they have some board games for you and your friends to play with, making it a fun place to hang out at or even just study in. They also have a stamp card rewards system (buy 10 drinks, get $3.66 off your next one - basically a free regular size drink).   Keep in mind that their drinks can be pretty sweet so do specify if you want it less. Other than that, I have found my favorite Chinatown tea spot!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty frequently to do homework and have boba. The staff is super nice and the boba is really good and they actually have a big size. They also serve snacks and some food so it's almost like a one stop shop. I can do homework have some boba and if I get hungry get some sweet potato fries or some ramen or popcorn chicken. The prices are good and the food is good as well. The decor is really cute and overall I love the vibe."}
{"text":"Tea Space has great tea. The guys working are very nice, and really I like the selection of tea that is offered. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I'm pretty picky when it comes to getting boba from elsewhere. First of all, their staff are extremely friendly. When they hand you the drink, they'll tell you to let them know if the drinks are not okay. I ordered their Milk tea with their special boba (forgot the name, but it's from the Christmas theme) and the drink tastes delicious ;)"}
{"text":"Great little boba spot in a quiet plaza. There hasn't been a wait the times I've been here, but its also very new. I bet not much people have heard of this place yet.   If you're familiar with the 626, this place is like Half and Half! It feels the same, looks the same, and the drinks tastes the same! My hubby is so excited to have a place in Vegas that serves ice milk now. Don't have to enjoy it only when we drive in San Gabriel Valley anymore.   Come give it a try! I'd hate for a boba shop like this to go out of business bc its not exactly in a popular spot. Good luck Tea Space!! Love you guys already."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is so nice to us. He give us free food  It's a great place to chill and play games with friends!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some drinks to combat the hot weather in Vegas and we came here late at night to hydrate. I was very pleased with the quality of their drinks. This is a new business and the owner was really nice and took his time going over what their popular drinks were and it seemed like he cared about his customers.  We ordered the Hokkaido milk tea and House green milk tea. The Hokkaido milk tea was good, especially what one would expect. But the House green milk tea? 5 stars across the board! This is one of those rare gems. Usually I've had substandard or really bad green milk tea, but this place hits the jackpot!  The ratio of the aromatic tea flavor and milk taste was perfect. Every sip was like a little taste of heaven. Honestly. (Trust me, I live in the SGV area in Cali so I know my stuff) But wow! I am very pleased with the drinks here.  Not only that, but this place is pretty cute. There's plenty of tables and seats. If you're a cat lover, then you will fall in love with Tea Space as there are plenty of creative cat artworks that is from an an artist. You can actually buy it off the wall if you like (they have price tags to the artwork on the walls).  Would I come here again on my next trip to Vegas? Of course. House green milk tea, I'll be coming for you again."}
{"text":"Cute spot and everyone is super friendly.   Only reason I'm not rating them five- I love jasmine and they don't offer it :(  I had to go for lavender option.   They do have punch cards, which they will offer up without being asked.   Their slushes are delicious, according to my family, but for my indulgent sea salt cream latte I'm still willing to hike out to my favorite spot across town.   I do love their cute cat themed decor. All in all, it's worth checking out if you are in the area, not a bad milk tea/boba alternative, with so many to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"I love to explore new boba places whenever I am out of town. My girlfriend found this place on yelp and we decided to give it a try.   The milk tea here isn't bad at all, in fact, I like it. The boba was soft enough.   If you're in Vegas & want to look for Boba, this could be your destination.   I'd rate the boba milk tea a 8/10."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp being the \"Hot and New\" category. Was driving around and all of sudden craving boba. Location of this spot isn't the best, but it is close enough to Chinatown area. You may judge this place by the outside thinking it's not all that, but once you walk in its a warm welcoming feeling. The design is very creative. My first order for this place is Hokkaido smoothie boba for me, and Wintermelon smoothie boba for my girlfriend. Wasn't disappointed in the taste Becuase usually the ice overtakes the flavor but this time the flavor overtakes the ice. The honey boba texture was good and chewy. Ordered a small and their size seems like a medium which is good. It took a little while to get our drinks that's Becuase they want to make its taste very well. This place is still brand new just open last week so they are still learning. I'm glad this place has stamp cards. The service was very genuine. Will come back again !!"}
{"text":"Cute ambiance. Staff is friendly. Love that they serve real hot food and boba a lot of cafes usually just sell snacks. Ordered the chicken curry and it was really good! Had a good amount of carrots and potatoes - just how i like it. Love how their drink sizes are bigger than normal and you can choose between those cute bulb cups for an extra fee. They only have small and regular sized drinks and their regular cups are as big as those large soda cups u get from mcdonalds-- basically theyre bigger than your average boba size lol would definitely come back cos i really want to try their hot pot next!"}
{"text":"Always freshly made Boba :).  Staff always make sure that you are satisfied with you drink. Drinks are not too sweet or bland."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea, very fresh. The staff are very nice and open to adjusting sweetness levels before and after purchase. Not too many seats but I don't think it's particularly busy.  One downside: wifi wasn't working for me :("}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite boba place to go. The boba is chewy, the staff is friendly, and the place is cute and always clean. By far my favorite drink is the brown sugar milk drink with warm honey boba.   This most recent visit we were told they did not have any honey boba though. Instead it was rose boba. They said they wouldn't have any regular for a few more months!! This seemed odd and rose boba doesn't seem like a good fit for many of the drinks they offer. The cashier could tell we were bummed out and let us try just the boba to see if we wanted any in our drinks or not. It wasn't as strongly rose flavored as I expected. When we did add it to our drinks though, it was no where near as good as the warm honey boba I grew to love.  I want so badly to give a 5 star review, but a boba place that doesn't have traditional boba is too disappointing. I know Ill be back though when that delicious honey boba comes back."}
{"text":"Cozy boba spot with food and games. We took our boba to go, but it seems like a spot I could hang out at with my friends if I wanted to.  They currently have a seasonal rose boba as opposed to honey boba. Don't fret, they offer to let you try it prior to committing. When we tried it by itself, it tasted just like regular boba, just much less sweet. We still ended up ordering the boba.  The only thing I would recommend is, if you usually lessen the sweetness level, don't lessen it as much as you usually do. We got our drinks at 50% sweetness, but I felt like since the boba was not a sweet honey boba, the drink was actually not sweet enough for me.  We got their Hokkaido and Okinawa milk teas with boba and pudding. I actually like the Okinawa more than their Hokkaido. I felt like it had more flavor, but both are still really good. Their boba was really fresh, so it was soft and chewy - I actually prefer it a bit more firm, but that just means that it was fresh!  Overall, really great drinks, but a bit on the more expensive side? Our total for 2 larger sized drinks (32oz each I believe?) and a smaller size was $18, rounding out each drink to about $6. I guess this is the trend now though, so I shouldn't be too surprised."}
{"text":"I finally found my drink! The Okinawa coffee with sea salt foam and pudding! Out of the maybe 5-6 drinks I've tried, it has to be by far my favorite drink and I've been obsessed with it since I first tried it!! Probably not the healthiest decision, but I even had it two times, two days in a row  it's become an addiction"}
{"text":"I ordered the milk tea and it was delicious! Great tea taste, reminds me of half and half milk tea in Orange County. If you like strong tea taste then this place is a must try! Plus the staff is very nice :)"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots in Vegas to have a tea/drink. The staff is super friendly and attentive without over doing it. My favorite drink is the starwberry milk blend with egg pudding (extra sweet)."}
{"text":"I am the advocate of pictures speaking louder than words. I would only write the review when it's exceptionally outstanding or awful. This review is for the former! I ordered the Okinawa coffee and Hokkaido milk tea with honey boba and taros (real taro chunks). They use Vietnamese coffee for their coffee products, so it's on the strong side. Good pick if you are a heavy caffeine consumer. And the Hokkaido milk tea is to die for, definitely the best in town. It's smooth, creamy and rich on the flavor even I ordered it with no sugar. If you are a fan of Japanese milk candy, Hokkaido milk tea is a must try and will bring you to the sweet milky heaven.  The owner is a genuine and attentive young man from Taiwan. He is informative and thoughtful. Tell him what you like, I believe he will make your drinks perfect.  They only provide two sizes, small and regular, $0.99 difference. The regular size is humongous!!! Great value!! Love this place and will come back soon. They are still on the soft opening now. Close on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite to go to all the time. Every so often I head here on the weekends from work with my significant other and have a good time. The tea is amazing and the staff is great as well."}
{"text":"I Love this place. I didn't care much for #boba in my drink but the boba here is so #delish.  I highly recommend. Refreshing and wonderful drinks. It Is also located at a great location. It is very close to Sunset Park. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tea space is quite amazing! There is a wide variety of drinks which are very delicious! Service is top notch. Very welcoming atmosphere. Plus, there sizes are quite large compared to other boba places! I recommend the Okinawa!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to try out the Almond coffee milk tea(5/5) and i love it. The drink was sweeten to perfection and the boba was soft and chewy. I will return to try out more flavors."}
{"text":"This is really my go to boba spot now. I just love the fact that their drinks are made fresh and then boba is warm, soft, chewy, and tasty! It's hard to come across the perfect boba consistency and for ME personally they have the best. The size to price ratio is really awesome and I always get double boba. You can order ahead and come in and pick it up and they have great, friendly service. It's conveniently near my job and is open late. So many new boba shops keep popping out of no where but nothing else compares to their quality of work. They just opened and every time I go my drink is always perfectly made and delicious! Yay tea space, don't ever change!"}
{"text":"First impression: Darker than expected. Given all the photos uploaded to their Yelp photo album by all the Yelpers. But it was very burn-your-irises-out-bright when I finally made my slight detour home after attending a funeral service for a chef that worked at Aria.  I was looking for a boba milk tea place on the east side, but nothing was close by or on the way home, and I finally decided to give Tea Space a try. The Wintermelon Fresh Milk Tea ????? caught my eye in one of the pictures, even though it was apparently a wrong order :p   Anyway, Immediately upon entering, but way before my eyes could adjust to the indoor lighting of Tea Space, I could hear a friendly greeting from the cashier (Dora) and offering me one of their folded paper menu. I took a quick glance to check seating availability, and was mildly surprise that pretty much every table in this cozy space was occupied. I guess almost all the cars parked in the small parking lot belongs to someone working at or patronizing Tea Space. So I will not be doing any studying here. So plan B it is.  I ended up ordering, as you probably already guessed, their Wintermelon Fresh Milk Tea with Egg Pudding ($0.50 charge) and also upgraded to a \"regular\". For an extra $0.99 it was totally worth it to upgrade to their \"regular\", which is actually a \"large\" 32-oz portion everywhere else. The drink was prepared and ready in a matter of moments. It literally took me longer to snap a picture of my order, applied some quick edits to make it Instagram ready than it took them to make my drink. That is Jimmy Johns fast!  Dora told me that customers can customize their drink's sweetness level, which I thought was slightly on the sweet side for me, but it was no big deal. I actually finished it, except for a few stray egg pudding, before I completed my drive home. There was hardly any ice left too, so they are definitely not selling ice here (or not any more, since addressing the displeasure voiced in past reviews).  I am trying to cut back on sugary boba drinks, was doing a good job of it too, but yes I would be back to eventually fill up yet another stamp card.  My only question is, why are they closed so early?  4 stars. Friendly. Fast. Lots of cat art (which I did not get to personally admire today)."}
{"text":"This place is my new go to boba spot ! It is very clean and the service is wonderful .The cashier is very helpful and nice ! Their boba is delicious!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great service. The cashier gave us recommendations and asked if everything was okay when we were already seated. I got a Okinawa smoothie with boba and it's already a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Extremely nice staff, very helpful in explaining drink combinations. Flavors are crisp and fresh. Indoor decor is relaxing and comes with plenty of seating and board games!"}
{"text":"SUPER NICE AND GENUINE. The second I walked in, she immediately got up offered me a menu, asked if this was my first time and listened to all my questions, and even got me a sample of their house tea. Tea light cup is only dollar more if u really want it and I would Go back 100%"}
{"text":"Tried the Wintermelon milk tea and the lychee slush. Both were excellent! I was impressed with how fine the ice in my slush was. My son mentioned that the boba in his milk tea was very pleasing; he really enjoyed the honey flavor.  Superb customer service.  Adorable kitty decor.  We will be back to try more! :)"}
{"text":"This is an decent tea spot if you already know what you're getting. For me, my favorite to get is the brown sugar milk tea with boba and egg pudding. And when I want something to snack, the popcorn chicken will satisfy the cravings.   Now the reason why I gave this a three is because I'm not much of a fan of actual tea in my drink. I get it, they're trying to be authentic but I'm not used tot the overpowering after taste especially when it's coming from black tea. That's just my preference though. Also, I understand they make there taro milk tea out of real taro which is cool but I'm also not a fan of small little chunks in my drink. I wish they had an option to remove them completely.   The popcorn chicken is just how I remembered it from the first time I ate them in Los Angeles. Now, the drawback is that they didn't have sweet and sour sauce. I've never really enjoyed such an appetizer without the latter so that was but interesting. Nonetheless, it was still really good. They offer ketchup if you're interested.   This place could use a little more improvement but I come in once in a while because it's the closest decent boba I can get to on a short timeframe!"}
