{"text":"I was totally impressed with Deep Blue FIsh & Chips! The actual halibut, despite its greasy, somewhat cakey batter, was great and totally melted in my mouth. The halibut, rounded out with crispy fries & tasty coleslaw made for a great meal.

I definitely will eat in next time b/c the dine-in menu looks incredible...
jamaican jerk battered cod w/ sweet potato fries, cajun corn battered haddock w/ spicy fries to name a few...OMG. yum! 

Prices are completely reasonable and well worth it!"}
{"text":"I do like Deep Blue, they do things a litte differently aside from most fish and chip shops and I have to give them props for that. For example, they offer sweet potato fries, a few types of coleslaw and serve and interesting green pea hummus with the meal combos, which serves to cut down on the grease part and have different batters for their fry's. Also the service here when I went was quite friendly. That being said, although the batter here is crisp, it is also enormously greasy and heavy. Connie describes it perfectly as an oil sponge and I have to agree."}
{"text":"R.I.P,

Deep Blue was the king of Fish and chips. No matter how hard I try I cannot find a suitable replacement for the ambrosia that was deep blue fish and chips. They did absolutely everything perfectly, the traditional fish and chips were nicely battered and so fresh you could swear they just pulled the potato out of the ground and the fish out of the ocean, they must have changed the oil just about every time a different person ordered.

not only did they have delicious traditional fish and chips, they also made their own tartar sauce, as well as other original sauces such as tropical coleslaw that they created (I have never had such a beautiful balance of quality food & sauce).

in addition to the traditional fish and chips, they had other variants such as Jerk, Cajun, and Malaysian batters, whilst having potato and sweet potato fries. It almost brings a tear to my eye knowing that I will never again eat this blessing that they serve as food.

I tried just about everything on the menu and every single item was delicious. Everyone I know, even people I don't like said that this place is a legend among fish and chips and is incomparable to anything else.

I hope that one day again they will open as they managed and deserved a thriving business. But for now all is lost.

I hope they're making those great slaws somewhere else.

The sides the sides the sides.

Love the different slaws  (get the tropical slaw!), the green pea hummus, the sweet potato fries.

The fish is always good and fresh, the batters can be heavy - but you can just pick it off and enjoy the fish and the sides sides sides.

It's comparatively new to the Riverdale diner landscape (like less than a decade - brand-new in Riverdale language), but feels like it's been there forever and belongs there.

Staffing can be a bit weird sometimes.  I think they're all somehow related, and they can get into somewhat personal squabbles on occasion - and no one's ever in a rush.

It's about the fresh fish and the sides sides sides  (go with enough people to order them all - but not so many people that you can't sample all the sides)"}
{"text":"This was THE best fish n' chip joint in the city, but my last three visits left me wondering what happened.

When Deep Blue opened two years ago everything was wonderful.  The traditional fish n' chip meal was perfect.  The Caribbean slant to everything was unique.

After eating here at least once a month, I've noticed a high turn over in staff, especially in the kitchen.

Today was perhaps the deal breaker.  My food, whle fresh, was served cold.  Yup ... cold fish n' chips.  Not even malt vinegar could save it. 

I hope that Gary, one of the owners, reads this and saves this (once) Riverdale gem.  

One other thing.  As of this writing, the Interac/Credit Card machine has been out of order for four weeks, so its cash only."}
