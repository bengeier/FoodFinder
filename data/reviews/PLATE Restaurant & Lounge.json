{"text":"Employee turnaround is high - no wonder service is poor.  When employees are not satisfied for being treated poorly, customer service goes down the drain.
Family owned and oriented - NOT!!  Bartender, Caitlin(?), is pitiful in customer care.
They obviously need a restaurant management to take care of their employee needs.
Also, the menu on their website does not reflect what they actually have at the restaurant.
The only good part about Plate is the Wine Down side of the restaurant. :("}
{"text":"We went to Plate , we had not been in since the change-over. 
 The place looks great! If you are going there to look at it your good, but if you are thinking you will get a good meal, you are not!
 I had the drunken Ribeye, how the guy in the other review could recommend this I have no idea unless he has NEVER had a decent steak in his life. The mushrooms on top were great but they were the only edible part.   It was grizzly and thin and overcooked, almost like it was pre cooked by the marinade and then could not be cooked properly.
 I did like the salad that came with my steak (the other steak on the menu does not come with a salad? weird) I would have liked it more if there was more of it. It was served on a saucer (really!)!

My daughter ordered the Panko Crusted Halibut  and it was fishy , not in a good way. It was replaced with the lobster Mac, she did like that , I tasted it and it was ok.

 My husband had a tasteless Filet Mignon
with smashed Potato and hated the smashed over crisp piece of baked potato (I actually liked this but I was the only one that did)

The son in law had filet and ate it but would not touch the potato.
Our waiter was ok he only forgot a couple things
I was asked about my steak and when I would not order something else was told then they would discount the meal, I said that would be great.
When the 
$100 check came she (?) had taken $2.50 off the bill,  really? Why would you insult your customer like that? It would have been much better if no discount was offered. Take off the charge for the bad food, buy me a drink, something! I would like to know where she came up with $2.50, my steak was $15 and I gave much more than 1/2 of it back to them, hum? Not an easy percentage to figure there, I may never know.
  I went to supper , I went to FRANKIE AND LOUIES 
, BUT I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK to PLATE."}
{"text":"Place is awful. Service absolutely SUX!! Have given it several chances but i finally called it quits. Food is not nearly as good as it was at the old location. Bigger is not always better. Especially in this case."}
{"text":"I have tried SO HARD to like the Supper/Plate line up.  I wish the owners would get a clue.  Service is horrible and the food is limited and inedible.  My dining partner got the fettuccine Alfredo.  Can't mess that up, right?  Wrong!  It was swimming in sauce which apparently came from a jar.  I had the southwest chicken salad.  The chicken was good quality, but I had a solid inch of cheese over the entire salad that had to be scraped off and balanced on the side of my plate.  The owner's mother, I was thrilled to see, was not present this evening as she has been on previous visits.  She has no respect for personal space and doesn't know when to stop trying to chit chat.  She makes me very uncomfortable.  
Here is what I don't get.  Plate provides the food for Winedown in the adjacent space.  I have consistently been THRILLED with Winedown's food.  What gives?? 
This is it - I am done trying.  Every time I drive by the place is deserted.  I have a feeling Winedown keeps it open.  Hopefully it'll close down and these owners will get out of the restuarant business in H'burg.  Can't we get something good here?!"}
{"text":"It felt like a nice restaurant, but our experience was unpleasant.  Hubby ordered soup and it came at the same time as the meal.  We asked the waitress and she said that's when the kitchen gave it to her.  We then asked the owner/manager (British accent) and she said it was unacceptable and then asked us if we told the waitress.  I said we did and she disappeared and came back offering to keep one of my husband's plates warm.  

In addition, husband ordered the prime rib sandwich which was like a 1 inch slab of fatty prime rib on a sub roll.  It looked completely unappetizing.  

I figured since we had the owner/manager's attention about the soup they'd AT LEAST take that off our bill... nope.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has really lost it. The service is always slow and we've given this place many chances. The food is not consistent and we've given up on this place for good. Sad, they had a good product and service at the old location. Bigger is not always better....... especially in this case. So long Plate!"}
{"text":"My husband I went to eat here on a Friday night around 7 pm and we were literally the only people in the main dining room...you would think that would have been our first red flag to turn and leave.  The restaurant was nicely decorated and appeared to be clean, the hostess and waitress were both very friendly so we decided to stay.  When we got our menu I was immediately turned off and ready to run; it was a single sheet of paper with extremely limited choices.  I have posted a picture of their menu because the link that it gives to a menu is FAR from whats actually on the menu.  If you eat beef or seafood you have few different options, I myself am strictly a chicken person so I had two options neither of which struck my fancy on this particular night.  Since we had already placed an order for drinks we opted to just get the spinach artichoke appetizer.  The spinach artichoke dip was extremely creamy (I believe it was made with a mayonnaise base) and served with \"fresh\" made tortilla chips (they were kind of cold and chewy).  Overall, the appetizer was ok, but not something that made me want to come back.  It wasn't the worst restaurant experience I've ever had, but I will not be back unless they revamp their menu."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Harrisburg. If you liked Supper you'll love Plate. Nice decor good service. Smallish menu but well executed. I've been for lunch and dinner and both are great.  Quiet but not too stuffy."}
{"text":"I went there with a group and surprisingly it wasn't packed, like most places on a Sunday after church. The service was kind of tough. We waited a few minutes to be seated because the hostess wasn't at the booth. When we got seated, we needed space for one more, when a bus boy was going to add another table, the manager told him not to and ask one of us to slide over (putting 2 people on the corners of the 4ft table) We had to ask them to add the tables o we could all fit. 

The menu says they serve coke products, but it is really pepsi products. When someone ordered a diet coke the server said, \"Ok, but we're running low so I can only refill you 2 times\"

Once the good came out, it tasted good. Mine was a little dry so I had to wait several minutes to get some syrup. And for the OJ drinkers. The Kids OJ comes in a bigger class that the Adult OJ. So my 2yr old was sharing her juice with her father.

Two folks at our table ordered burgers, each with a different kind of french fries. They but the burgers on the wrong plates. So they got the opposite fries they ordered. 

When it was time to check out, the server brought us all our checks, he only had one pen so we all had to wait for the other to finish to leave. 

Like I said, the food was good. But I was not satisfied with the service at all!"}
{"text":"We were curious & decided to check this place out.  WOW, the service was outstanding and the staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.  We were served great food that was served on time, with nice presentation, and great flavor.  The dessert was delicious.  Homemade desserts & salad dressings are always a sign of a great place to eat.  The atmosphere was relaxing and contemporary.  This place is a gem for the town of Harrisburg.  I wish them the best success.  We love to try new places and we have eaten all over the Charlotte area.  This is definately one that we recommend."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere in the dining room. This has so much promise and my husband and I were really happy to see the change over from Frank & Louie's, and had high hopes for a much better menu.
The first couple of times we went for breakfast.  We weren't completely wowed, but it was a better menu than some of the other restaurants offer in the area.  We had the same waiter both times, and thought the service was good.
We came for Mother's Day,  and didn't realize that we had no other choice but to order the brunch buffet...okay, we tried to work with it.
Once we were placed in the corner, the service was slow...and we were ignored.  And not because it was busy, but the waitress was BUSY socializing at every moment she had.  So unprofessional!  I had to ask another server for sugar for my coffee when I realized that she wasn't coming back anytime soon.
The buffet was lacking....to say the least.  Everything that we  put on our plates was ice cold which lead us to believe the Sternos were not on. My husband double checked to see that they were, so we figured the food was old..  Besides the fact that it was cold, sadly,  it wasn't even good. The scrambled eggs had a taste as if it was mixed with seafood. When we asked about it, we were told that they were not a specialty scrambled eggs. Eggs shouldn't taste like fish if there is no fish in them. This was definately was NOT a \"chef driven\" menu that was offered for Mother's Day. 
Like the previous review, I also have never had to spit food out of my mouth because it was so bad....even the baby wouldn't eat anything but the muffins, and this kid eats like a champ! 
After paying $13 per person for a buffet that was not only lack luster and cold, we left disappointed paying for a meal of fruit, sausage, and muffins.  I could have stayed home and cooked....we should have stayed home and cooked.
When leaving, we walked past the host stand that was absolutely filthy with server drinks and half eaten food and cookies on it.  That was the icing on the cake. We will think long and hard before we ever decide to come back.  And I did say \"if\"."}
