{"text":"Great price when u do the dinner combo.  Also steamed fish tilapia is done very well."}
{"text":"oh my goodness please please please I can not stress this enough DO NOT GO TO PINE TREE !!!! my friend and I felt very sick after because they probably re use the oil and the food is extremely greasy. the wait staff is EXTREMELY rude! they will shout at you in Cantonese even if you don't speak it and they always seem very frazzled like they have a lot of responsibilities to tend too but honestly...I can probably do it all myself in a friendly and efficient manner. 

if I can give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. 

TIP : students, they will try to scam you so look in the menu to find out what the REAL price of the food you're consuming is because they always overprice the meals on the student meal menu."}
{"text":"This place is so inconsistent that it frustrates me to the max. I always stick so the same order so I expect the same taste but NOPE. This place manages to make my simple dish of beef chow mien into the most hit or miss meal of all time. One day it will taste like something sent from up above and other times it'll taste like noodles drenched in water. Not sure what the chefs are doing back there but they definitely need to stick and follow one recipe. I avoid coming here because you never know what you'll get and I'm not up for that kind if dissapointment."}
{"text":"While the food tastes pretty good and the prices are cheap, I'm not cool with finding extra protein in the form of a fly in my bowl of noodles.... 

After eating a portion of the noodles then discovering and showing it to the wait staff, they were unsure what I wanted.    I wanted another bowl of noodles without a fly.   Paid full price for the noodles in the end."}
{"text":"Err... how are the ratings so high at this place?
My experience here was pretty bad - both the food and  service were terrible.

Admittedly, I was both starving and a little hungover when I came here for lunch so I ordered the baked cheese and meat sauce spaghetti. The cheese was clearly processed, the sauce was overly salty, and the meat was too fatty. Everything tasted artificial and I think eating it made me want to puke even more. 

The wait staff of this restaurant was predominately 2 young males and one of them was rather rude. When we sat down, the table was hella dirty with stains and food remnants of the previous customers so we asked if he could wipe it down. After begrudgingly doing it, it seemed that he was giving us attitude for the rest of our time there. He was super slow with his actions (when we could clearly see him doing nothing loitering near the cashier), served all our dishes at the edge of the table, and failed to take away finished dishes (or only took ONE when specifically asked.. even though we had already collected and pushed a few to the side of the table).

Although the other dishes that were ordered looked slightly \"more okay\" and perhaps only my dish sucked, the despicable service that I experienced really deters me from wanting to come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant will lure you in with the inexpensive family style combos, but unfortunately the service is horrendous and very little to be desired. The waitress/cashier woman (I suspect she's the girlfriend of the younger male who's also at the cash register).  She is a total B!TCH!    She will give you attitude for no apparent reason, she acts as if the customers are all a nuisance to her.   Word of advice to the owners, tell your son to leave his bitchy girlfriend at home and to stop ruining your customers experience."}
{"text":"Small family style Chinese restaurant.

It is very affordable for famiy dinners for a casual night out, especially when you don't feel like cooking.  We've been here many many times, such that it's become one of the staple restaurants we go to.  At least once a month, probably more, that we end up here.
For the purpose of this review, I will recall the meal with a party of 15 (yes, they had to put 6 tables together to fit us) that we ate tonight.

Service is average, but for price you pay, I'd overlook it and just focus on the food :)
Price varies but you're looking at $7-10 per dish. We ordered around 10 or 11 dishes to share between everyone.  But here are my thoughts on some of them:

1. Mushrooms with Beef (and onions)
- Saucy, the beef is bit chewy, but the mushrooms make up for it

2. Sweet and Sour Pork - quite dry actually, they are usually better

3. Corn sauce over deep fried filets of fish - crispy and fresh filets, covered in sweet corn sauce, always a winner

4. Chicken (whole) - this is one of their staples, and sometimes they even run out!  Order this one for sure!  It's very very good.

5. Lemon Chicken - sauce was a bit too diluted, but the chicken itself was flavourful as it was deep fried a bit, kind of like a cutlet

6. Vermicelli + Cucumbers - one of their veggie dishes, a bit bland but good to go with your steamed rice

7. Fish + Potatoes - saucy dish, good with rice, fish is soft and easy to eat. Potato is a weird mix but it works.

8. Shrimps + Scrambled eggs - another signature chinese dish, eggs were done perfectly. I'd say this is another favourite

Decor is average, nothing special, you walk in, tell them how big your party is, they sit you down.  They have posters with chinese menus all over the walls, they also have english menus if you ask.

Overall, it's worth every buck you pay.  Check it out when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food is acceptable, service is HORRIBLE, especially the young waiter and waitress. Worst service I have ever seen. We almost got into a fight with them."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! I came here before by myself and they didn't give me a table and want me to wait. They had a table for four open. That's the smallest table they have inside. So I left.
Today I actually came back because my son want to eat congee. We order 2 congee and luncheon meat, egg, cheese sandwich. One minute after I saw the special with the congee so I ask to change to one of the congee to a special which comes with a fried chicken noodle. The waitress didn't look like she want to change it but they did of course. 
When the 2 congee came there was also 2 fried chicken noodle came. So obvious they change 2 congee to special instead of 1 but I didn't say anything. Then when the sandwich came there was no luncheon meat in the sandwich. I told them it was missing . The sandwich came again and still no luncheon meat. Are you SERIOUS? Finally it came again and got it right. 
The congee has no taste at all and the fried chicken noodle was a joke. Don't even want to explain it. I think this restaurant worker should wake up!!!! This is definitely my last time stepping in to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very rude service and takes a long time
Made me wait one hour even though the food was already sitting on the ledge and my tummy grumbled 
Food was decent but not worth the wait 
Also there was hair in the food and warning some tummy problems after ..."}
{"text":"very close by to where I live. Food is acceptable and price is considerably cheap. This place is mainly about quantity of food and price. If you are looking for quality food, this is not the right place.

The lunch specials are quite well priced with large portions. If you're not a big eater, you can perhaps even share one lunch with two people. The prices in this restaurant could even be slightly lower than a food court foods. 

They use to include taxes with dinner specials, many choices of dishes available, one item change recently, no more included tax. Cash deals only...they don't accept any credit card and/or debit I believe.

They do get crowded during dinner hours  but a good thing is that they do deliver. I ordered for delivery and it came in an acceptable time frame. Tip the guy generously!

Good place for fast and well priced foods!"}
{"text":"Decent place to get your Chinese food fix if you live closeby and don't want to go too far.    Food is alright.  The walls can use a new coat of paint to make the place look less dirty/dated."}
{"text":"This place is super cheap.  The combo comes with rice even when dining in!  I don't recall other places allow this.  And the combo is cheap, too.  $14 for a dinner for 2.  If you deduct $3 for the 2 bowls of rice, the 2 dishes only cost $11.  In terms of food quality, you have to be willing to accept lower quality ingredients due to the prices.  Certain dishes taste better than others.  For example, the free range chicken (half chicken) and stir fried vegetable with chicken slices are quite good, honestly.  Portion is okay.  

Service is simple but sufficient.  Place is clean enough.  Honestly, I don't expect much at this price point, as long as the waiters are not rude.

I will be happy to return for a simple, inexpensive dinner.  Sometimes, home style, comfort Chinese food is all I feel like having."}
{"text":"I really love eating here.. Cash only .. Super affordable family style good eats in Markham . amazing deals: I would say , very worth it & authentic !

{"text":"Horrible service. One of the ladies didn't understand English, but gladly I spoke Chinese. She tried scamming us in Cantonese saying that the student deal costed $10, which the poster clearly said $6.50. Then we pointed at the poster and she was like OKAY you're supposed to order saying the number. So we ordered and she said it was $8. Eventually we needed another waitress to come take our order who ACTUALLY understood English. It appeared that she came up with arbitrary prices by her head...  She has really bad manners as she talked to us with a rude attitude when we questioned the price. I don't really feel like coming again. This ruined my day"}
{"text":"The only thing that sets them apart from other Chinese restaurants for dinner is their chicken.  

They also have deals for 3-6 dishes of food.

Buuuut, that's about it."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood restaurant good for casual family breakfast, brunch, afternoon tea, and dinner :)

My family and I came here for Chinese new year's eve and it was a good thing we made reservations because it was rather busy! It usually isn't though so unless it's a big holiday, don't worry about not getting a table. 

We got the dish combos with 4 choices. It comes with soup and 4 bowls of rice in addition to your 4 main dishes. We ordered the famous steamed chicken, lemon chicken, baby pak choy, and honestly, I'm not quite sure what the name of the last one is LOL. It's spare ribs with an dark orange-coloured sauce...It was only alright so you're not missing out on much. 

I say you must try the lemon chicken!!! It's my favourite item here :) It's just fried chicken strips in lemon sauce but very appetizing. They usually give a lot of lemon sauce so if you'd like to keep your chicken more crispy, ask for sauce on the side. 

Baby pak choy was delicious too but that's because they probably added quite a bit of salt/MSG and it was fried in oil. You can probably ask them to just cook it without salt or oil for a healthier alternative. 

Steamed chicken was a good size and was ok. It's just steamed chicken so no particular compliments or complaints. 

The food here is quite good in taste, portion size, and won't empty out your wallet either ;)"}
{"text":"Good Place if you want something cheap and fast and taste ok.

Nothing fancy.. You know you can eat here for a good price..

They have specials the whole day.. the lunch order are big, you can share it with another person.

For dinner, you can pick any combinations of entrees dishes and they all come with soup and rice. There are choices of over 50 different entrees to choose from. 

The selections are quite good with choices of some home cook style dishes!! And for a 2 choice entress dinner set, 2 can eat for $12.. however portion might be a little small.. 

It can be busy during dinner hours.

CASH only!"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favourite Hong Kong fast food restaurant in Markham (HK fast food is stir fry dishes served with coffee or milk tea or soup, and they are cooked and served fast!)

Here are my fav orders at Pine Tree:
- Cantonese style chow mien (served with squid, shrimps, beef, lots of thick sauce)
- chicken wings + fries
- satay beef and vermicelli
- satay beef and fried ho fun (flat rice noodles)
- stir fry four season beans and fried rice (our unhealthy indulgence for salty, savory, flavourful green beans)
- curry chicken and rice

These are really the only HK fast food dishes I know... There's a fried rice dish with spoonfuls of beans and meat, with a cracked egg in the middle. This is one of my fav HK dishes too but I've had better elsewhere! Their wonton soup noodle (or any soup noodle) is quite bland.

The prices are so cheap. Usually my family of 3-4 would pay $20-30 for a bellyful meal -but of course it's because we share dishes. Soup (sometimes included with meal) is very flavourful.

Staff here are quick and they're very nice. 

CASH ONLY"}
