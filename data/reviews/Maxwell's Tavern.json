{"text":"Excellent place I visit every time I am in Waxhaw.  Come early, it gets full quick as here is limited seating.  Pork chops are to die for!  If you leave hungry it's your own fault!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maxwell's several times with my family. Every time the food has been really good. Wait time can be a long time, but we have come to expect it since it's so small. 

Recently we went for dinner. Being a big beer geek, before I order a beer I've never had, I like a small taste (less than an ounce) to make sure I like it before dropping $5 on a crappy beer. I asked for one and they promptly stated 'we don't give samples'. I could have a flight instead. Well I only wanted one beer, not 4 small ones so I just said I would drink water. The owner comes back with a small shot glass 'we don't normally do this, just so you know.'  Guess it was my 'threat' of drinking water that changed their minds. 

My wife ordered a pita with ranch instead of the sauce that comes with it. They charged us 50 cents for the substitution. 

I ordered a burger off the chalkboard (didn't even need to check the menu) for $10 and asked if they had onion rings. Waitress said they sure did. Got the check and the burger was $11.75. Asked what the added charge was and she said for substituting the onion rings for the fries and said that the upcharge is listed on the bottom of the menu. Well I ordered off the chalkboard!  Would have been nice to be alerted 'we have onion rings, but there is a slight upcharge'. 

I just don't like to be nickeled and dimed for stuff. Be upfront. Tell me there's an extra charge. And any good tavern/bar/brewery will let you taste a beer before ordering it. Heck dock me a shot when you pour my beer if you have to!"}
{"text":"We usually choose Waxhaw now as a great place to eat, instead of traveling to Charlotte, or going to another \"chain\" which has made our area just no fun to eat out... Everything is great there."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with a friend and had an excellent experience. I had a Cobb salad and my friend had the fish and chips and we both were impressed. The service was also pleasant. Will go back in a minute."}
{"text":"First time here and we were treated quite poorly. Told there was 50 minute wait but it ended up being 90; the extra time was because they  called a number of similar size parties that had arrived after us before seating us.  One member of our party had a 2 hour drive to make after dinner.  I don't mind waiting but do mind when first come first serve isn't followed. Then it was another 55 minutes to get our hamburgers and fries after ordering. Food was good but I don't know if it was actually really good or we just very hungry by the time it came. If you have 3 hours to spare for a burger or sandwich then this place will be good for you."}
{"text":"Great tavern in downtown Waxhaw! This little tavern  has very good chicken pita and club sandwich, both are hearty portions and you won't leave feeling peckish. They have TV's around the tavern for sports and a decent selection of draft beers for those interested in sporting events. Price's are pretty good for the amount of food you get. Only drawback is they are always busy, seating is short and prime time hours always have a wait."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend. I was trying to be healthy so I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. I was thinking it would just be passable bland food but it really had a lot of flavor. It is in a great location in an awesome small town area. Definitely worth a day trip!"}
{"text":"Everything, yes everything, is delicious! My favorite its the maple cured salmon. Greek burger is awesome too. Bbq is the best pulled pork you will find!"}
{"text":"The food was good, for American bar food, but the service was a bit lacking for a few reasons. First, there is no waiting area because the place is tiny. We had to sit outside in the cold for over forty-five minutes. Second, after the long wait our food came in quick succession so that the drinks, apps, salads, and entree were all out in only fifteen minutes. I know, who ever complains about speedy service, right? But the bottom line is that it was my lady's birthday, and I just wanted to have a nice dinner spaced out over an hour, not wait in the cold for an hour, and then have to eat a three course meal in twenty minutes.

The waiter was very polite, and attentive, but I suspect we had to sacrifice at least ten or fifteen minutes of our lives waiting on the hostess to converse with all the regulars, which was pretty much everyone but us.

The bottom line is that everyone was nice, the food was up to par with any other American style restaurant, but the wait was too long, and the seating options sucked. Without much of a bar to wait at, it was a cold night out front followed by all three courses lined up on the table, far too quickly. I suspect this is more a matter of preference than anything else. I like to be seated inside of twenty minutes so that we can have drinks at the bar, and then get the courses over forty-five minutes so that everyone isn't rushing, and there is time to be social. In the case of Maxwell's tavern, everyone in the place finished eating inside twenty minutes, with lots of people at tables conversing over empty plates for another hour, while people sat outside in the cold starving. It would be a nice hole-in-the-wall if they could get the timing right."}
{"text":"We've been to Maxwell's quite a few times and always loved it, great food and good service. It's kind of a 'go to place' where we always knew it would be good. Last nite was not. In the past, the bartender was more than happy to allow us to sample a beer before ordering it.. until last night. We were told they do not offer sample because they have beer flights.. unless this is something new, I have never seen beer flights on the menu and have never been anywhere that refused a tasting (especially when they would make more money off of us once we taste and then order it)  We had already orders our apps but at that second we decided to close our tab and we wont be back. Not happy customers at all.."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. Everything else I would rate as vanilla. Nothing great, nothing bad."}
{"text":"Loved this quaint little place! I tried the fried pickles as an appetizer- they're the best this southern girl has ever had! Ordered the tavern burger- huge and delicious! Can't complain other than the wait to get in...and the fact that people waiting in the doorway for their table are practically on top of your table while you eat. Other than that...will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love Maxwell's Spaghetti...random i know but it's very meaty and has a good flavor!  The noodles are a little thick for my liking but they are typical spaghetti noodles!  Def a fun atmosphere ...check i out!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Waxhaw ... Went to Maxwell's during the Autumn treasures festival (cancelled due to rain) ... Wait staff in costumes, food was delicious, wine list excellent!  From Boston so we are tough critics.  Burgers, steaks and pulled pork was all great!  Caesar salad was so crisp.  Great kids menu!"}
{"text":"Always good food, great service and good value. My family eats at Maxwells all the time - happy to have such a reliable Tavern so close by."}
{"text":"The foods good, nothing better than most chains. The issue is the extended wait to be seated. I have come twice. the first time the wait time was quoted at 45mins. and it took an hour. the last time we were quoted 40 mins. and it took 1 1/2 hours just to be seated.  the food is not good enought for such long waits."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good beer and excellent wait staff await you at Maxwell's. 

Try the Greek Burger topped with feta cheese, onions and peppers. 

The wait staff is careful to ensure that you are being taken care of while not going to the point of bothering you too much. 

Great atmosphere, great time. Watch out though, the wait times can get long since it is a small establishment."}
{"text":"The food and staff are great, the quality is great also.  The reason for two stars ,,, Change your menu options, this has been the same since day one, my wife and i frequent your resaurant, but pretty much only have drinks, because the menu is a bit stale, and the specials are not special anymore its the same thing weekly! if you do the same thing for the last couple years it should be perfected as it is, LETS  TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, MAYBE STEP  OUTSIDE THE BOX .."}
{"text":"I had pulled pork sandwich and fully loaded bake potato- both were very tasty! Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great southern food. Cleanest public restroom I've ever seen in Waxhaw. Very historic. Good tavern burger and awesome fried pickles! Good service too. Will plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"Good service, lousy food. My burger was bland and not cooked evenly. Pink on one side and gray on tge other. My cousin hated her bourbon wings. She said they were really tough and she only ate one. The fried pickers were good, though. I can't imagine a scenario that would make me choose to eat here again voluntarily."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Food is amazing. My favorite is the flank steak. They also have good salads and burgers and the fried pickles are to die for! Fun atmosphere, always a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of our favorite places to go!  The hamburgers are delicious, they grind their own meat so you can get them med rare.  Everything we've had was very good, Pork chops, wings, bacon wrapped filet.  Service is always great.  They also have a 100 sanitation score!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! I've NEVER been disappointed. As a newbie to NC I love to explore the local flavor. I'm not sure this is exactly local flavor but I assure you it is great food at a good price. My son ALWAYS orders the wings and this is his favorite place in NC. I've eaten here any times and always have a good experience. Crowded often, this just tells you it's worth the wait. The menu isn't unique, just good. The staff is great, the atmosphere is nice and the quaint little town is cool. Be sure to stroll down the street for ice cream after. I'll return again and again."}
{"text":"Finally had a night to myself for the first time in years, and decided to try 'Insert name' Tavern, but even though they were still open, they were no longer serving food. The staff was rather rude about it, which deflated my excitement over what was to be a rare occasion for a busy mother and business owner. Luckily I stumbled upon Maxwells Tavern on my sulky ride home. The staff was warm and welcoming and the food was the best I've had in town! Thanks for saving my night!"}
{"text":"I have been numerous times for lunch, dinner and late-night, always good food... good beer... great service!  Today's lunch was no exception."}
{"text":"Maxwells is great. Delicious food, great service and a really nice atmosphere. I just wish they had more space because it's always packed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Maxwell's on Sunday afternoon. The food was good, and the service was very efficient and friendly. Their burgers are enormous! My pulled pork BBQ sandwich was okay. Not phenomenal, but not bad. I think I'm just spoiled by better barbecue in the area. Definitely an enjoyable place to hang out and grab lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Waxhaw's something of a hidden gem in this region. It's not that people don't know that Waxhaw exists, but it is a bit out of the way for most Mecklenburgers (hey, remember the Mecklenburgers? Give yourself a pat on the back if you do!) to make the drive here. Well, it's not really all that out of the way. Whatever. What's cool about Waxhaw is how it's embraced its' small town charm, without making too many concessions to the modern world. Lots of small shops, and a few excellent dining choices to make here if you're inclined to spend a few hours here.

So what's my point? Nothing, really, except that if you're not making it into Waxhaw, then you're missing out on Maxwell's Tavern.

From the looks of it, Maxwell's is exactly that, a tavern. You've got your pub fare, you've got your big screen TVs, you've got plenty of beer on tap. Check. What separates Maxwell's from the rest of the crowd is its respect for the dish. You're not burdened with typical (read: boring) pub fare; instead, you're treated to several different and imaginary choices on the menu. For example, the Black n' Bleu burger, sprinkled with a generous dose of black pepper and smothered in bleu cheese, is a far and welcome cry from your typical pub-style cheeseburger. In other words, you won't go wrong with whatever you sample from the menu.

Lots of draft beer to choose from, and Maxwell's always serves up a few beer specials. This place has become one of my favorite watering holes.

Keep in mind a few things which, for me, don't earn the coveted five-star review:

1. It does get very crowded here, regardless of the time. Maxwell's is pretty much THE PLACE to eat in Waxhaw, so don't be surprised if you show up at 3pm on a weekday, and the joint's crowded. Expect long waits on weekends.

2. It does get VERY LOUD IN HERE. Maybe it's because Maxwell's is a relatively small-sized pub. Maybe it's the exposed brick. Maybe it's the Pittsburgh transplants screaming their lungs out while watching their beloved Steelers shit-stomp all over Kansas City. It gets loud. If you bring the kids, maybe bring them some ear plugs. For yourself, as well. This could be a turn-off for some, but I don't mind chatter. I do mind the TV being blasted at full volume, which thankfully all the TVs are set to mute.

3. It does get busy here, so expect to wait a wee bit longer for your meal. Also expect your waiter/waitress to be occupied with other tables, so unless it's an emergency, such as they're a severed finger in your plate of fries, just wait a few for a refill, okay?

If you're coming to spend a few hours in Waxhaw, or live in the area, I highly recommend stopping by for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the middle of Waxhaw with good food and service.  Worth stopping in for lunch if you are in the area.  Would come back anytime for a nice American style meal."}
{"text":"The fried pickels are truly amazing. The rest of the food is fantastic. I absolutely love the atmosphere and staff. Love coming to this restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is my favorite place to eat in town. The steak salad is the best as is the salmon salad. Heck I would eat here everytime if there wasn't a long wait to get in. Maxwells rocks, why do you think there's usually a wait to get in?"}
{"text":"I've tried almost everything on their menu and it has all been wonderful! I also enjoy their selection of NC beers on tap! Great day or night!"}
{"text":"Maxwells has become a staple in Waxhaw for good food and family friendly.  Didn't think anything could replace the bridge and rail restaurant. But they have done a good job. I do miss the brunch the bridge and rail had though. 

The bar area is small giving way to mostly sit down table service which make this place family friendly.   Good burgers, steaks., salads. ....good Tavern type food.  Only downside is its extremely popular and you'll be waiting if going at prime dinner hours."}
{"text":"Great flounder.  Good atmosphere.  Steak was ok but a little bit over priced."}
{"text":"My favorite place around here. Every time I've gotten food it's been really, really good. Good draft beer selection. Staff is top notch. Everybody I've been here with loves it. It does get crowded and louder during busy hours. You might have to wait a little while for a table. But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service. We sat on the back patio which was really nice. Our food had absolutely no flavor at all. I had a grilled chicken pita; there was no flavor to the chicken or the tzatziki sauce. It just tasted wet. I didn't eat even half of it. My husbands fried fish plate was equally tasteless. No flavor to the breading or tarter. Neither of us are more than half our meal. Bill came to $31 for lunch. 

People must rate this place on service only because the food is forgettable."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. We had about 25 minute wait. The place is hopping with people coming and going. U had the teriyaki chicken wings (very good). You can get them charred on the grill but I chose not to. They still had a bit of crunch and delicious!  Also tried their cheese quesadilla.  They were good also.  Hubby had the back and blue burger. It was a decent size and he said it was very good also. They have outdoor seating which we didn't see. Our waitress, Mimi was very mice and she would check up on us once in awhile. We will definitely go back.
It's nice to see many families here."}
{"text":"Great place...family, sports ( tv's), good beers, bar food and nice entrees, too.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Maxwell's Tavern is sort of a diamond in the rough out in Waxhaw. There's not much to choose from, restaurant wise, out that way.. so make sure you hit this place up if you're in the area.

The thing I like most about Maxwell's is the ambiance. I really love the exposed brick walls, chunky wooden booths, eclectic decor, and the warm glow of the pendant lighting.

The menu is really basic, but high in quality of ingredients. I've only ever tried the Garden Burger (which is one of the only 2 vegetarian items on the menu). But it's a great veg option! A thick patty, hearty bun, choice of cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, spear pickle, and a giant stack of fries. For $9 you're definitely not going to leave hungry."}
{"text":"A great stop in Waxhaw. My wife and I frequently come here on a lazy Saturday for dinner (followed by Waxhaw ice cream). Never disappoints. The service has been so-so recently which why I had to give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. Hopefully that will get back to a higher level soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Kat, one of the owners, was incredibly hospitable and we were excited to celebrate a birthday!!! Dirk, behind the bar, isn't much of a conversationalist, but he makes a MEAN Old Fashion. Come visit when your in Waxhaw!!"}
{"text":"Went to Maxwell's after having stayed away for 8 months due to a problem with service my daughter and I had received one Friday night. So this is a review of the past 2 times that I have been there. 
Sept 16, 2016:  2 stars!  We were seated on their awesome back patio, but when we would order something, there was a reason they couldn't do it. I ordered 12 wings, hoping to have 2 diff flavors. NOPE - you must order 18 before they will split the flavors.  My daughter ordered a burger w/garlic-mashed potatoes.  NOPE - They don't serve garlic mashed potatoes after 9. What the???? At that point, I was pissed and just ordered a coffee & a shot of Kahlua, vowing not to come back for  awhile. 
May 25, 2017:  4 Stars!  Desperately wanting a rare to medium rare burger, but not wanting to drive too far, my husband and I went to Maxwell's.  It was crowded, and one of the hostesses appeared to be having a bad day. After we were seated, the other hostess informed us that our waitress had just gotten a number of tables, and it may be awhile. I appreciate the notice - communication is key and no one wants to be kept waiting without knowing why. 
When the waitress appeared, she was great: very quick, and efficient.  It wasn't nearly the wait that I was thinking we may have to endure. We each ordered our drinks and burgers. Luckily, there were no issues; the food was good, and the waitress did an excellent job."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  Very nice!  Great burger, great atmosphere, great location!

There is a huge beer selection both on tap and in bottle.... I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than Maxwell's! The food is always delicious. Quaint downtown location can't be beat. It's definitely our \"go to\" local spot and we make sure to always take our out of town guests."}
{"text":"Was pretty busy when we were there but had a super good burger. Good atmosphere, friendly staff who worked hard to keep us happy."}
{"text":"This past weekend, we decided to take a self guided history tour of Waxhaw (you can print the PDF from the city website) Naturally, when visiting a new town, one must try the local eatery. We settled on Maxwell's Tavern because it had the best reviews on Yelp. As usual, my fellow Yelpers did not disappoint!

I was concerned there might be a wait when first walking in, but we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was typical of a local tavern with a full bar and strategically placed TV's. Our server was very friendly and made certain to bring us water before asking what we wanted to drink. She recommended the Black and Bleu Burger which my fiancée ordered. I ordered the special which was the Jiffy Burger. 

The food came out just as we were finishing our beer. Both burgers were cooked to order (medium and medium rare) and were topped generously. Mine was topped with peanut butter and cheese. If you've never tried this combination before, give it a shot! You will either love it or hate it, so you might be better trying it at home. I love it and find that, if a menu has a burger with peanut butter, I will always order it.

I would definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in Waxhaw for the day."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, if you're in the Waxhaw area, this is one of the better options for lunch or dinner. Standard bar food basically, a large menu with all the usual American pub favorites. I had a burger the last time that I was in here for lunch and it was good, not awesome. The patty was a little dry, but the meat's flavor kind of made up for it.  I had some fried pickles as well, they weren't anything to write home or on Yelp about, but again, not bad either.

All in all, as solid place, and it's on the way to the horse track out there, so if you're headed back and hungry, swing on in for a bite."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Our drinks were delicious and everyone enjoyed their food.  Be prepared for noise and crowds though."}
{"text":"Downtown Waxhaw lunchtime Awesomeness. My girlfriend texted to see if I wanted to have lunch and I was so down as I work from home and usually make my lunch daily. She asked if I had any suggestions and I immediately suggested places in Blakney or Ballantyne as they are both only 15min away.
I pulled up old trusty (Yelp) and searched on lunch nearby and up popped Maxwells. Living so close to downtown Waxhaw it's a shame that I've never ventured to hang in downtown or even try any restaurant. 
We built our home in 2012 and this is my first time eating in downtown (insert mouth drop). 
I'm pleasantly surprised and will be bringing my husband back to have lunch on his off day. 
The space isn't huge however it's very down home and what I had was AMAZING. I had the special salad for the day which was a seasonal Apple salad with several types of apples, blue cheese, and I added grilled salmon. The salmon was grilled to perfection and the apple cider vinaigrette was the perfect addition.
The one downfall to me is the size and the fact there is no changing table in the ladies room. It's a family area so I expect the businesses to have changing tables for families with small children."}
{"text":"Typical restaurant and bar. Decent food. They have excellent peel and eat shrimp. Extremely packed being that it's basically the only place in the area."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I expected to be let down by the burger....I was wrong! Service was a bit slow but very friendly staff. Had this months special the pimento burger...cooked perfect to temp great burger. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was an ok experience. We would return in the future. The reviews and neighbors recommendations made me think it was going to be amazing. It was just decent tavern food, nothing that met the standard I had set in my mind. We waited 30 minutes for a table and we were sat at a community table. The server was quick and attentive though. We got chili cheese fries which were good. We liked the chili because it was really \"meaty\" instead of \"soupy.\" We also had one burger, which was not cooked medium well, it came out medium rare, and was a very fatty piece of meat. That was super disappointing. I had the fried fish sandwich, which was also just ok. I ended up just eating the fish, not as a sandwich. The portions were big, and I didn't feel it was overpriced, so that was a positive."}
{"text":"Their French fries are to die for. I had their classic BLT on rye toast. It was delicious. It could have used some more mayonnaise, but it was good to eat."}
{"text":"This place is so hoppin! Love the food & the friends we've made there as we go every Friday night! The burgers & fish 'n chips are THE best! Also the Greek gyros & grilled chicken salad are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great service--seated us earlier than promised, and in a comfy booth that worked with our infant car seat.  Strong beer menu and the night we were there all Carolina draft beers were discounted.  Biggest surprise was that the food was delicious!  Fried pickles, patty melt, burger, and philly sandwich were all very good.  We'll be back if we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Always so yummy and the staff are so fun and attending.  Love this little place!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here. Specials are great (fish and chips) pork chops are great!  Salads great!  Salmon perfectly cooked. Waitstaff always helpful and friendly. Great beer selection. Go!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't comment on the food.  I have been told by colleagues it is good.  Watch out for the terrible wait and the bias wait line.  Tables sit completely empty while people stand about or sit outside on benches because the girls that are hosting have no clue and arent seating people even though there are open tables.   Somehow other people walk in and don't get put on a waitlist and tables are available at a moments notice.  Sorry the burgers arent good enough to be treated so rudley that you cant find a table for 1 but can find it for 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8."}
{"text":"Ordered the carolina burger, the amount of chili used was the size of a quarter, VERY disappointing. Will not return as the server felt the amount was correct."}
{"text":"The food & service are great. My complaint is paying $8 or $9 for a mixed drink that is so weak a child could drink it. I ordered a tall mixed drink on an empty stomach and felt nothing. Stupid enough to order a 2nd. Barely felt anything. And I hardly ever drink alcohol so it's not like it takes 10 drinks to get what resembles a buzz."}
{"text":"We LOVE Maxwell's Tavern!  The food is always fantastic, the service is great and the atmosphere is wonderful.  I typically get the veggie greek pita and it's awesome.  We've also gotten the potato skins as an appetizer twice and they never disappoint.  The Hubs loves the burger options, and we've eaten here several times with friends that love the burgers as well.  Great location in downtown Waxhaw, great food, great service.  Go!"}
{"text":"We live nearby & eat here often, food is great (hamburgers & spaghetti are our favs). Service is always wonderful. The only issue is seating space, and if you go at 6:30 or after on most nights you will most definitely wait for a table... Occasionally we've tried on a Friday or Saturday and left because the wait was over one hour!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Maxwells for an early Sunday dinner. We were going to go somewhere else but decided to go here because it was packed at 4 pm. We thought that was a good sign. 

The food itself was very average. We got the house salad, Parmesan garlic charred wings, BBQ sandwich and a burger. The bbq sandwich didn't have much meat on it and the sauce was average. The burger was extremely well done and a very thin patty. Salad and wings were also very average. Decent place to grab a bite but not overly impressive. Server was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food with a wide selection. It is usually crowded, but I have really only been on weekends for lunch, so perhaps it is about my timing as well. At least if they are crowded, there is a bit nearby to kill some time. highly recommended."}
{"text":"My bother & I went to Maxwell's for a late lunch on a recent Sunday and we both throughly enjoyed our visit. Everything was on point including the selection of beers, service, and the food.  

I chose the shrimp & corn chowder and chicken quesadillas. Both were delicious and the portion sizes were just right. My bother got a club sandwich & fries and the sandwich was huge. He said it was very good as well.

Our server was very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  He made some good suggestions for local & microbrews as well.

This place is definitely on my list of places to return to soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered Maxwells and brought our food across the street to the Dreamchaser's Brewery. We were glad we did, because there was a wait at Maxwells. We go to Maxwells frequently. The burgers are always good at Maxwells and I had the BBQ sandwich last time and it was delicious. They usually have a good selection of seasonal beers and a nice outdoor patio in the back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat.  We normally do takeout as the wait for seating is very long, but it never disappoints!  Love the food!  It is made with quality ingredients and is always very good.  Love the decor too.  The exposed brick walls are great!  If you go during the winter, you have to try the winter-pear seasonal salad.  That is awesome!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect much to come out of the little spot on the map known as Waxhaw, but I was pleasantly pleased with Maxwell's. Just a small, street-side eatery/bar with some kitschy decor and pretty standard menu. However, if a meeting or gathering needs to take place in Waxhaw, this is definitely my go-to from here on out. 

Made it in on a weeknight and the place was packed. Tons of booths and 4-top tables, a small row of bar seats, and an outdoor patio. The patio was barren due to the chillier weather, but the rest of the place was hoppin' like it was a Friday at 730. Took about 30 minutes to get a table, but it was cozy inside and there was live music. Great stuff, too. Grabbed a few brews from the bar and just kicked back while we waited. Not a bad alternative to immediate seating. 

Once seated, we started with the chips and salsa. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just plain corn chips with some decent salsa. The salsa does have a potent red pepper flavor, but it isn't unwelcoming. 

I ended up ordering some wings per the server's recommendation. I saw that they had spaghetti on the menu, but our server seemed a bit dicey when it came to this dish. I was intrigued, still, but ended up going for old reliable. The wings were....meh. Nothing to write home about. I ordered them medium and they might as well have had no sauce on them. I asked for a side of the hot sauce and things were a-ok. They have a few other sauces, but none sounded remarkable. 

With live music, decent draught beer selection, and some decent menu choices, I'd definitely come back if in the area. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Waxhaw, but trying to get in on a weekend is always a wait. We usually get our food to go and it's ready in 15 minutes. The service is always exceptional. The food is fantastic and at a great price. The ONLY thing I don't enjoy is the fact that there doesn't seem to be any sound-proofing and when it's full, is almost too loud to talk. Wooden floors, brick walls, no sound-proof ceilings. It's the reason why we almost never actually done in. However, everything else is fantastic. If I didn't have to yell to be heard, I'd give it five stars."}
{"text":"The food is always great, service is good. There is always a wait but worth it. My only complaint is that it is so loud in there you can't have a conversation"}
{"text":"nice atmosphere.
excellent food.
good service.
most important - it is consistent - you know what to expect and you get it."}
{"text":"Just tried Maxwells for the first time and it absolutely lived up to its review! Food was excellent as well as the service. We tried the potato skins and they were amazing. My fish was perfect and my husband raved about his burger! We took dessert to go since we were stuffed, but we're happy to see the towering chocolate cake was AWESOME! We will go back and bring our family with us!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Only 3 stars because of the extensive wait  and it's a bit  loud. The
tNachos are  awesome  and oversized and the fried fish  great.  Just wish it was larger so the wait was shorter."}
{"text":"For me, I think the sign of a good restaurant is gauged by my desire to want to go back to said establishment when I'm at a different restaurant.  

Just the other day, I was at the neighborhood run-of-the mill tavern/sports viewing center/food consumption place longing to replace the pita and hummus appetizer for Maxwell's version.  A simple thing you might say, but so well-executed at \"MT\"!

I've never had a bad meal at Maxwell's; in fact, I've never had a better steak salad at any establishment...ever!  Ah, the Blue Cheese dressing...I have often wanted to ask them if it is commercially available.

Lastly, for those with kids, the kids meals are above-par.  I find myself wishing for my son or daughters to order the grilled cheese so that I can surreptitiously eat off of their plate.  Bad father?  Perhaps.  Appreciative diner?  Definitely."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Waxhaw! Hands Down!

I go to this place all the time when I'm out for a Saturday doing business. I'm a baker in town, and frequently need a fast dinner on Saturday evening. Maxwell's is my place! Absolutely love the burger! Savory, salty, hot, meaty, delicious, fabulous! Bacon add's a wonderful touch as well. Cobb salad is also the best - if you're looking for something a bit on the healthy side. Service is great. They get you in and out fast - if you're like me and you need it that way!"}
{"text":"Maxwell's is one of our favorite places to go for a quick night out in Waxhaw.  Their burgers are fantastic and I love their onion rings as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I am addicted to trying their burger of the month. I wait with great excitement to see what it will be.  They are always busy because their food is so good and the service is spectacular.  A true gem and a must try."}
{"text":"Stopped in Maxwell's at about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and it was still pretty busy! There was a man singing and performing, and the overall atmosphere was great. It was cool and trendy without trying too hard to make it that way. Noise level can be a bit loud, so not the best place to have a conversational date or get-together. 
Service was a bit slow but our waiter was very nice and did a great job keeping up with water and being pleasant. Our food (burgers) came out shortly as well. It was great!! The burgers are well sized and the fries are thick cut. You really get what you pay for! Couldn't even finish all of my Carolina Burger, had to box it up for later. 
Would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident. They have the best service and food in Waxhaw. Everything on the menu is delicious and the wait staff is awesome as well as management/owners."}
{"text":"The premier burger place in Waxhaw. Always busy always good. Burgers, entrees, salads and sandwiches. They have a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience!! Being new to the neighborhood and definitely afar away from what we at used to. Food was great and the service even better!! We had a wonderful waitress named Jarah. So kind and accommodating and especially informative! I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and service is usually on top of things. Atmosphere is tight, crowded and loud. Not very good for a date night, but it's great for a burger, beer and hanging out with a few friends. Try them during non-peak hours, as the rush times almost always require a wait for a table."}
{"text":"I ate at Maxwell's last week while walking around Wraxall . The food and presentation were great, however the Carolina Burger which I ordered was just okay. 

It wasn't anything special and the Coleslaw tasted a bit dry."}
{"text":"I love the food and the staff is super nice!! Potato skins are HUGE AND SO YUMMY! Onion rings are awesome! All the food comes out fresh and massive portions!"}
{"text":"Glad we had a chance to try Maxwells after the parade.  Hubby loved the club sandwich and ranch, said it was amazing. I had the hummus, tasted good, but they need to use less salt.  Overall nice place to eat in Waxhaw, fast and accurate service."}
{"text":"expand expand expand please or allow ppl to put their name on the list.  this is one of the only games in town & Waxhaw.  unless you are here when the doors open.  it's never less than a 30 min wait.  solid upscale pub food.  fried pickles & onion rings are favs.  tavern philly is cheesy goodness.  chicken burger is flavorful & can make it different each time"}
{"text":"We eat here often. We would probably eat here even more often if it wasn't so packed EVERY NIGHT. The secret is out on this place so get there EARLY if you don't want to wait.  The food is great and consistent. Prices are very fair. We love this place in downtown Waxhaw."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Amazing food, service, prices, and menu selections. VERY busy most of the time, so be prepared to wait....wait...wait... Can't blame them, it's a small place, in a town that finally has a great local place."}
{"text":"How hard is it to get someone's order right? Every single time I've gone there. I order and it's like they could give two sh*ts of how I'm ordering it. Don't go here unless you want your food how they like it."}
{"text":"Great food.... always a problem to get in... No Reservations is a problem when you want something special for friends without waiting 30 minutes.  Excellent Service.  NOISY!  If you order your hamburger or ground beef steak dinner rare... it comes rare!"}
{"text":"Maxwell's continues to be great.  And it is ever growing more popular and crowded.

Come early and you can call in to get your name on the list, but when your name comes up, you need to be there.

Seating is tight, so don't count on large groups getting seated.  The traffic is too heavy to accommodate.  

Each day there is a soup special, each home made, and the menu remains static with some items on special each day.  Not a lot of variety but they stick with what they do best and that is what you get.

Bring a coat for winter if you get stuck inside the door.  It is just a door without a wind break, so that cold air envelopes you quickly.

Lunch is a better bet and especially if you are outside of noon to noon-thirty.  11:30 is good, likewise 1pm."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic - the service even better. The burgers did not disappoint & my Philly steak sandwich was juicy & delicious as well. We learned that you have to get there early (we did) or you'll have to wait for a table. We're already planning what we'll try on the next visit!"}
{"text":"Maxwells Tavern has NEVER disappointed me once. The staff is absolutely amazing in many ways, they are extremely fast, professional, and caring, they definitely make sure you have the best experience possible. The food is hard to describe with words, everything is cooked to perfection and to your desire. I am know for making complicated orders and they have not once messed up my order. Maxwell's Tavern is by far the best American/ Tavern style restaurant I have been to in North Carolina!"}
{"text":"In my 5 days spent in Waxhaw we came here twice! It was that good that we came back again. My husband loved his burger and I loved my salad and the dressing tasted homemade. My salad had grilled salmon on it which was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. The fried pickles are tasty! I never realized how good fried pickles could be!"}
{"text":"Love this place: nice atmosphere, great service, good beer selection, and of course, some simply delicious food!"}
{"text":"Have been here a bunch of times and its always been pretty good to great. Even when they are super busy they get you in fast. The food comes out pretty fast as well, which is good when you are dining with children. The wings and burgers are stand out items. I don't love steak fries so I have subbed them with onion rings and those were very good. They also have a good hummus and pita app. Chicken fingers, fried flounder, cole slaw and mashed potato's are all really solid as well. Its got a really nice interior and the service is friendly, prices are reasonable. A great spot if you are in the Waxhaw area."}
{"text":"First time i went their the bartenders are real nice and helpful i ordered their burger with jalapenos and salsa...It was amazing since they do their own high grade beef their you can order burger patty's medium rare witch i love...their burgers are amazing"}
{"text":"Great club sandwich.  When you sit on the patio the air conditioner unit on roof or an exhaust fan generates a lot of noise."}
{"text":"My wife loves the seasonal salads and I typically go for a burger, philly or chicken fingers. 

The place is always crowded which should tell you the food is worth the wait.

Be sure to try the fried pickles as well!"}
{"text":"Without reading any reviews, we stopped in for a quick bite after shopping at Factory World.  Loved the atmosphere and the service. Our lunch was really good. We had fried pickles as an appetizer... a must have... and the Tavern Chicken Philly and hubs had wings. Expect a bit of a wait. We'll be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Finally, good family food in Waxhaw!  I've been there 4 times and have not been disappointed.   Be sure to start with the fried pickles - enough share, but you won't want to."}
{"text":"Not a complete fan of this restaurant. The atmosphere and staff were great but the food was nothing to write home about. We ordered the Macho Nachos as a mid-day appetizer and were extremely disappointed. There was barely any toppings on the chips. We were able to count how many tomatoes & jalapenos. For $9.50 for nachos, we expected much more."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with a few friends when I went home for Thanksgiving.  Our wait was about 20 minutes, which honestly for a Friday night wasn't too bad considering we had a large group.  I really liked the vibe of this place.  Very casual, but made me feel a bit classy at the same time.  I felt like there should've been a fireplace somewhere. 

The menu had so many options -- mostly sandwiches/burgers, but a good amount of salads and entrees as well.  Of course, coming back down to North Carolina for a few days, I had to give their Pulled Pork Plate a try.  They also have a BBQ sandwich, which I would have gotten if I didn't see the larger plate.  Sandwiches come with fries (which looked so good I had to snag one from a friend), while plates come with your choice of two sides.

Our food came out relatively quickly, especially given the full house that night.  I took one look at that Pulled Pork Plate and knew I'd hit the jackpot.  A heaping pile of pulled pork, coupled with some garlic mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and baked beans -- classic Southern fare.  It was even topped with a large piece of garlic bread, to my surprise.  The presentation was on point, and the food was absolutely fantastic. 

I can't speak for any other items on the menu, but I would highly recommend that you give this BBQ plate a try if you're in the Charlotte area, but stuck closer to the suburbs/SC.  Definitely the best I've had outside of the uptown area, and it probably even tops some of those places.  The best part?  $11 for all that food -- what a steal.

It's a real shame I only found out about this place after I left!  I'll definitely have to come back."}
{"text":"No waiting for lunch today. Arrived at 2 pm. Think we've broken the code. We each had the Tavern Philly with chicken, minus peppers. Very cheesy and filling. Cole slaw as a fries substitute was very good. Good service. You get your money's worth."}
{"text":"We live Maxwell's. The burgers are incredible, and the wings are almost as good. There is almost always a line outside, and it is worth waiting. The wait staff is friendly, and they are accurate when you order take out."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice in the last week. Both on Saturday nights. The place is always packed and when you have the drinks and/or the food, you'll know why. Great service, great food. Everytime we go, we run into someone we know. 

The atmosphere is wonderful with the brick walls."}
{"text":"Friendly service,  great fresh food! I had the marinated flank steak that was marinated,  tender and juicy. My spouse had the blackened steak and loved it too.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Quaint little place in the heart of town! Great drinks and food!"}
{"text":"My new go to place. Simple yet delicious menu. Friendly bar. Homey, atmosphere. Works for a casual date night to family night."}
{"text":"Decent food, a bit loud unless you are drinking at the bar, then you're the loud one....  A bit over priced.  The spaghetti portion was pretty big, but less and cheaper would have been better.

I went for a burger and it was average - I had heard the place was owned by the same folks that own The Dive-In...  So obviously I had high expectations for the burger.  Everything is great at the dive in... But it is a greasy diner burger and the maxwell's burger is a tavern burger- so I know hard to compare, but the maxwell's burger tasted like any other run of the mill tavern burger.

I should point out my family loves maxwell's...  I guess I just have higher standards :)"}
{"text":"Very busy very good service very good burgers
They should give the very nice young lady who works the bar some help
She was taking a lot of phone orders and did handle the bar drinks and food orders as well as drink orders from wait staff
But she needs some help 
Will return"}
{"text":"Rude workers and below average food. While seating was fast, our server paid very little attention to our table. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here!!!  Upbeat!  Good food. Good service. Great for date night but not a romantic place. Too bright and noisy. But that is the way they are!!!  Servers and Bar staff very helpful!  Popular place. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go at peak times. Always busy though. Music on Wed evenings starting at 6:00 is a treat!!"}
{"text":"Maxwell's has a great atmosphere. We went on a Wednesday and there was live music that we actually enjoyed. Classic rock like..Billy Joel, Elton John, etc. The food was tasty and the menu was o.k. Addition of a pasta dish would be awesome, though. My husband had the ribeye sandwich and said i t was tasty, but not as good as reviews that we had read before going. I had fish and chips, and it was pretty good. We'll be back. It was a good time! :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are great everything on the menu is okay wings suck Buffalo Wild Wings are even much better and the drinks are way to over priced they charged us 18 dollars for one double grand marnier crazy even downtown Charlotte is cheaper."}
{"text":"Maxwell's in Waxhaw for lunch. Upon recommendation I had the salmon entree & chose a baked potato & green beans as my sides. I like we get to choose! Nice portion of salmon but it was overcooked for me (server didnt ask & I forgot). It also tasted alittle fishy so not fresh. I drowned it in lemon.
Huge potato! And the beans are Italian green beans which was a welcome surprise & were very good. Overall, not impressed. Service was good, she was attentive & upbeat. I'd go back to give it another chance & just have something else...like maybe the pork chop."}
{"text":"I love Maxwells.  It's loud, it's comfortable and super friendly.  The food is really good too!  The seasonal salads...oh yeah.  Crisp greens, nuts, fruit, grilled chicken, and its all really fresh.  The fried pickles are a hit with my family, and the main entrees are always delicious.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were participating at the Waxhaw Kaleidoscope Festival as a vendor yesterday and I got hungry for some real food i.e. not out of a truck.  I took a short walk to Maxwell's for a to go order.
The place was packed because of the aforementioned festival so I saddled up to the bar to place my order.  The bartender was friendly and handed me a menu and a much needed ice water since it was 90 + degrees outside.  I had been to Maxwell's one other time with friends and had one of their amazing burgers but was in the mood for chicken wings.  My Daughter who is gluten free asked for a salad with grilled chicken.

I ordered the grilled chicken \"Maxwell's Salad\" for my daughter which she ate all of so I'm assuming it was great.  The wings....AMAZING.  I ordered a dozen, medium, charred chicken wings.  They had all the qualities of what I consider awesome wings.  They were crispy which I'm assuming was because of the charred designation which without explanation I assumed they put them on the grill out of the fryer and tossed them in sauce.  They were HUGE which is nice because nothing is worse than spending $12.00 on puny wings.  They had a great sauce, the medium wasn't too hot but sweet with a little bite and just perfect.  The bleu cheese dressing was a nice accompaniment, not sure if it was home made or not but nice nonetheless.

Only negative and it's not a huge deal which bothers me about many places in a \"to go\" situation is that you have plenty of napkins and plenty of sauce.  I asked the bartender who handed me a sealed plastic bag if we had plenty of napkins and got \"It SHOULD be in there\".  So basically that tells me she didn't check.  I gave her a 20% tip for basically punching in an order in a POS system to get that response.  Well guess what, when I got to my booth with 12, large sauced up wings I had a grand total of 2, thin from a dispenser type napkins.  Remember my daughter?  She took one so now I had one, thin from a dispenser napkin.  Can you imagine what my face looked like after eating 12 (awesome) wings in 90 + degree heat on a lawn chair without a table?  Let's just say it wasn't pretty!

At the end of the day, we enjoyed the food from Maxwell's yesterday.  It is a great place in a great town.  Menu is perfect and everything I have eaten there is top notch!"}
{"text":"The food has been great, we've been in 3x. Introduced me to the Olde Mecklenburg Brewery beer Yule Bock (\"Weihnachtsbock\") which was just yummy. It's really loud at first but you do get accustomed to the noise volume. Brought our kids and they were able to hang and not bother the other diners who also had brought kids. Good pub food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings. If you get them make sure to get then charred and don't miss out on the bourbon. They make their own bourbon sauce and it's so sweet and sticky. It is seriously finger licking good! Burgers are also big and juicy.

There was one time we went and before we drove there my wife called and asked if dogs were allowed outside. The hostess that answered said they did allow dogs outside. When we arrived the hostess acted like we were idiots for thinking dogs were allowed and said that only service dogs were allowed.. Then she asked my wife with a condescending attitude if she called the right number. This confirmed she thought my wife was an idiot. My wife pulled out her phone and it rang in the restaurant. The hostess shrugged us off without apologizing for the miscommunication.

I knocked off one star for that incident. Other than that though service and food has always been great!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Great little town feel, great food and fantastic service.   Can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"I was actually shocked at how good Maxwell's was... I went in thinking it was just a solid pub (burgers, wings, fries) that was nothing to write home about, but they have gyros on the menu! Obviously some Greek influence in the kitchen.. and BTW, their gyro is VERY GOOD! My wife ordered the platter and it came with a mountain of gyro! Onion rings were good.. as was the peel and eat shrimp since their cocktail sauce was sinus clearing horse radish perfection!

The dessert menu looked incredible, but none of us had any room to even dream of ordering anything. We will be going back to Maxwells!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. We dropped in for lunch soley based on the Yelp reviews. I had the ribeye sandwich with fries. daughter ate the kids chicken with fries and husbby had the patty melt with fries

We also tried the fried pickles- they were very hot and enough for 2 (two) PEOPLE TO SHARE. they were very tasty, and the ranch was nice to except for it being to thin.


my steak sandwich was realy nice. cooked to my liking but the seasoning was almost not there. I had to salt and pepper the heck out of it.

hubby's patty melt came on rye bread. he felt that the meat had no seasoning what so ever. 

we had a nice lunch, but keep in mind this is a tavern so dont be shocked if the annoying dude at the bar keeps hollering at the game above the bar. or the loud overbearing people in the table near you have had to many beers at 1 in the afternoon. (yes people we were annoyed but your obsurd behavior!)

our server left something to be desired. I don't think he has waited on tables very much. we left him only a 10% tip- which is more than I had wanted to leave. 
he was NOT attentive, he acted like it was a bother to come serve us. ANOTHER server kept refilling our drinks. Wish we could have given the tip to her. 

I think we may try this place again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch. First off, good luck parking. It was very busy and no tables were available, so snce I was by myself I just sat at the bar. 
I ordered the tavern philly with fries. It's a simple order, true, but it was very good. And simple as it seems,  some times it's difficult to find a good philly. I will be back next time I'm in the area to try some other tavern treats. Maybe next time I will be able to get a beer. They only have about 8 on tap,  but there are a few I have never had."}
{"text":"Good food!  Fun atmosphere.  Kinda loud in there but, love this place!  :)"}
{"text":"Flank steak will change your life! Try to get there early, but still worth the wait. Friendly staff and everything I've ever had from there has been delicious."}
{"text":"A great Waxhaw staple with consistently great food and wonderful service. We love Maxwells!"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food here, we ordered the flounder which looked really good when it was brought to a table next to us and it was disappointing a bit too fishy for our taste, my kids ordered hamburgers and they were pretty average, one of them a bit over cooked, my son had ordered it medium and it looked more on the well side, their fries are okay and I thought the onion rings were pretty good.
The waiter was polite and attentive but the accommodations were not great, our table was too small for a party of 4 and literally at the entrance of the restaurant, didn't take much to drop a glass of water making the experience a bit worse.
With so many choices around, I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Maxwell's seems to be the place to be in Waxhaw on a Saturday night!!  40 minute wait at 7:30 and the crowd was steady until we left around 9. I'm so glad to see a local, small business doing well!

Service was attentive and friendly.  The restaurant was very clean and the food was fresh and very good. I had the Garlic Parmesan wings and they were SO good!!  I also had a Greek salad that I enjoyed very much. My husband had the pork chops and he really liked them (thick cut and super juicy!).

It was an enjoyable meal and a nice night out ...without needing to venture too far."}
{"text":"I'm giving the restaurant four stars for the ambience, food and friendliness. Our server could have been more attentive. We came here with my parents and we really enjoyed it!  The restaurant itself is small but has a great atmosphere. The hostess was very sweet and thoughtful. Our server was nice, but definitely slow. We  had to wait at least five minutes to successfully waive down our server every time we wanted our water refilled. One simple way of providing great service is by never letting drinking glasses get empty. My mom and I had the Greek burger and it was really good. My husband had the black and blue burger and said he loved it. My dad doesn't eat red meat so he had a fish dish that he liked. Overall we had an enjoyable meal and would come back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Their menu is great and EVERYTHING is fresh and delicious!  They have daily specials and no matter what you decide to order, you won't be disappointed.  

The atmosphere is laid pack, so you can go in jeans and a t if you like.

It does get packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait.  Just know that it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to dine for lunch in the heart of Waxhaw. I particularly enjoyed the $6 flight and there were a lot of good options to choose from. I would definitely recommended the burger. We were served attentively and the establishment has a nice ambience. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Quite the place; a little too commercial but wonderful service; food and drinks. A go to place in a small local town."}
{"text":"Very fast service.  Great for kids, good activity pages.  Outdoor seating is nice.   The food is good.  The Greek chicken pita was great.  A good kids grill cheese."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & location. It has become my favorite place for weeknight dinner in Waxhaw.  Very friendly wait staff.  Veggie pita and fried pickles are consistently good.  Maxwell's is a great addition to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious!  The food was all hot, fresh and a good size portion. The Greek Salad was the best I've had and the (Maxwell's OPA Platter)Gyros were amazing! The wait was a bit long but we had great bar service in the meantime.  Good  amount of drink and beer selections. The wait staff was very attentive. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Another good dinner at Maxwell's.  Good wings, spaghetti, pork chops, and attentive staff.  It got a little loud, but that's all a part of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Casual and always crowded. Nice bar, booths, tables-individual and communal, and nice outdoor seating. Large sandwich, salad, and burger menu-I had the veggie pita-lots of feta cheese and fried pickles. 

Park on side street or if your lucky in parking lot by train tracks. Mix bag of young, old and working people mostly locals."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great value. We will be back! Had the very fresh salad and wife had the filet which was cooked perfectly. Hidden gem in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"We tried Maxwell's Tavern out for two reasons. One was because of the reviews, and two was because its relatively close to us. Also, since moving to the south I have basically become obsessed with deep fried pickles, and need to try them wherever I go. :)
We got to the restaurant and were spoken to right away. The girl was super sweet and told us she would seat us shortly. We were seated within about 3 minutes. 
We were sitting down and our waitress came over right away. He name was Sarah. She was friendly, prompt, and extremely helpful. Our beers arrived within 5 minutes (if that). She came back and took our order. And our appetizers came again within about 5 or 6 minutes. The fried pickles were DELICIOUS and my husband said the wings were also perfect. We finished our appetizers and it was about another 5-10 minutes before our main came out, which was great. I hate when restaurants bring out your mains minutes after you've only just started eating your appetizers. So Maxwell's tavern had everything times perfectly. 
Sarah also made some suggestions to my husband regarding beer to try. He loved what she suggested! 
Our entrees arrived hot and fresh. Everything was delicious (the slaw was some of the best I've had here). 
We will definitely be back again! Keep it up Maxwell's tavern! Everything from the service to the food to the prices was excellent!"}
{"text":"It was tasty. Shroom burger was a little light on mushrooms but it was tasty for sure. Service was excellent. It was very clean. The menu was great, will definitely try something different next time. 8-17$ per adult plate kids 5$"}
{"text":"First timers. Stopped for Sunday lunch and cocktail. Good good, great drinks atmosphere nice. They were very busy but Clarissa was very efficient and took time to explain the menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant in Waxhaw!  First of all, we're so happy to see a business thriving there.  The staff is great, portions are huge, food is great and beers are the best.  

The wait can get long so get there early.  It's often hard to get a seat.  But go if you can, great place!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  A fun local tavern with fun  decor in histortc downtown Waxhaw.  This is my new lunch hangout."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it's always a good experience. Very clean and the food is always cooked as advertised. 

The staff are attentive and helpful. It's hard to get in after 5:30pm so get there early."}
{"text":"If you are anywhere near Waxhaw, you need to visit Maxwells. They have a very cool, private deck out back, and great burgers and fries. This is also one of those places that you can order a burger cooked medium. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a very well run establishment.  Very consistent and they hire good people.  My wife and I have been eating here since we moved back to the Carolinas two years ago.  The food and service is always good no matter what time you step in.  Yes, you may have to wait sometimes.  Boo Hoo.  Perfect time to go to the bar and have a drink.  They always have a good beer and wine selection.  Burgers are really good.  My favorite is the Carolina Burger.  They are one of the very few places that can consistently cook a true medium rare burger.  They recently changed the buns they use and wish they would go back.  Too much bread now.  My wife usually gets one of the salads which always has nice fresh greens.  We have tried several other menu items which were all good as well, but you always end up with your favorites.  Glad to have this place right around the corner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Waxhaw at the furniture market there.  We drove through downtown Waxhaw on the way to pick things out and noticed how beautiful and quaint the small downtown area was.

After we purchased our furniture we asked the locals where we should stop in for lunch.  They recommended Maxwell's among other restaurants we're excited to return to try.

The bartender Cody was extremely welcoming and helpful.  We had a great conversation with him and he was great at going through the specials and making recommendations.  We were starving so started with  the fried pickles.  Crisp, not greasy, and served with some homemade ranch. They were awesome.  Our draft beers came out fresh and cold.

My girl had the blacken grouper sandwich was off the charts good.  Perfectly seasoned and all ingredients were very fresh.  The salad especially was top notch fresh.

My black and bleu burger was cooked to perfection and the seasoning and sides were on point.  My girlfriend couldn't keep her hands off my fries as they were hot, fresh, and just a light crisp.

The atmosphere, service, and GREAT fresh food will have us taking day trips out to Waxhaw for many years to come."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Maxwell's that I wanted to give it a try. We like to celebrate our wedding anniversary with our sons (in addition to our adult-only dinner) so we chose Maxwell's. 

We went early on a Wednesday evening and the place was full which was the first good sign. The second one was the 100 sanitation rating. Every staff member was warm and friendly. Our server, Darren, was super attentive; no one's glass got below half full!

We selected fried pickles for an appetizer. A tad salty, but still tasty. Hubby and I were convinced by Darren to try to fish (pangasius)  and chips. Excellent choice. The serving size was rather large....four pieces of fish! Two of our boys selected burgers which they reported as tasty. And our little guy got his staple:chicken fingers. 

No room for dessert while there so we grabbed a piece of sweet potato pecan praline cheesecake (that's a mouthful and it was)! Not sweet enough for hubby but perfect for me. It was extremely fluffy and rich in flavor.  

We have found a new, local spot!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this is close by. The food and service is good. Their beer selection is great too. They always have one or two solid craft selections, which rotate."}
{"text":"Flounder plate is excellent!! 
Spaghetti is pretty good. They don't give you enough sauce for all the gazillion noodles but ask for more sauce!"}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about this place. The food is ALWAYS over the top great. The service is impeccable. The prices are more than fair. Even if you order take-out they give you the same sized portion that you would get when dining in. 5 BOLD stars for Maxwells!"}
{"text":"Had cheese burger....dry and quality of meat was terrible...chewy!  This place was a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and beer.  They make some interesting special burgers that I have tried during my 3 visits, and they were all dang good!  The place is small though, so waiting long periods to sit can happen on busy nights.  Luckily downtown Waxhaw has a couple more place to eat that are pretty good and within a block from Maxwell's.  I like this place and have noting negative to say about service or food, but it's not worth a 30 minute wait when you can walk across the bridge to a another good pub."}
{"text":"A little tough to get in and sometimes the wait is a bit long, but definitely worth it.  Food is really good, their burgers, wings and chicken quesadilla  are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"I ordered the tavern hamburger and it was excellent. The meat was cooked well and the fries were huge."}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful with service to match! I love the burgers at this place and can't wait to go back!"}

So I headed to Waxhaw Saturday to get some farm fresh eggs at the farmer's market.... Didn't get eggs (got there too late and I found out the chickens were/are on strike do to the heat) but I got a GREAT lunch instead!

At first I was a little leery of Maxwell's, but I'm glad I went in. 

Started off with sweet ICED tea - not sure what it is with restaurants that can't provide you cold tea --- I always need a second glass of just ice. Nothing worse that luke warm 'iced' tea.

Ordered the flank steak salad -- I was in need of meat food -- glad they had this offering. 

The salad came out and it was at first overwhelming as it was extremely large! The salad was basic (as most NC salads are) - mixed greens, four tomato slices, four cucumber slices, one hard boiled egg cut in half, three or four rings of red onion, some store bought croutons, and an overkill of cheddar/jack cheese sprinkle. Very restaurant generic... blah. I asked for a side of bleu cheese dressing.

I was able to over look all of these as the cut of flank steak was de-lish! Cooked to perfection. I devoured that meat. 

The cheese was overkill- ruined a healthy bland salad with tons of cheese... what's the point. I should have ordered that on the side as well. Nothing more do I hate than playing and picking through my food. 

The salad would have been soooo much better should they have paired the flank steak with bleu cheese crumbles.

I'm sure some may find this to be a perfect salad, but as my personal preference, a salad is bland when you can REMEMBER how many slices of vegetables were put on top. And it's a bad salad if you try to bury it cheese and dressing... at least I was smart enough to get the dressing on the side. 

Would I return? Yes, but I'd just order differently as I now understand their plating skillz. 

Oh and the drive was pretty wonderful too... it's beautiful over there."}
{"text":"waxhaw think this the best restaurant please  fry pickle? hamburger? the best restaurants are moving from this st town in the middle of no place you really think maxwells and stacks are 5 stars restaurants? please"}
{"text":"The food was great! Whatever you do don't forget the fried pickles! The people were nice, service was a little slow because they had so many larger parties all show up and sit at the same time. The people kept flowing in and after eating there I know exactly why. I had the ribeye sandwich which was great. My wife and daughter loved their burgers and that's always a good sign (8 oz burgers, now you're talking) We will be back!."}
{"text":"One of the best in Waxhaw - along with Mary ONeil's. Have been going here just about weekly since they opened up."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Staff, Nice Bar.

The only problem here is that it is that good, and I have to go \"off peak\" hours to enjoy a meal there.  If you brave go during regular lunch, or dinner hours, prepare to stand in line and bring your ear plugs.  Very noisy, ......but good.."}
{"text":"Been to Maxwell's several times in the past 10 months, we always leave full and satisfied.
Our recent trip was no different. Was a Tuesday night around 7:30 or so. 
The hostess was friendly and helped to clear a table for us to sit. 
Service was superb and attentive with a sense of humor as well. 
I ordered the Black and Bleu burger, med well w/ fries. My daughter had the BLT, the wife had the Asian Salad and a Mojito to drink.
Side note: as the Mojito was being delivered by the waitress, the bartender stopped her, asked for it back and made another. He must not have been happy with something which scored high in my book showing quality and attention to his trade.
My Burger was cooked to perfection, bun was toasted and crispy. I initially thought there was not enough \"Bleu\" on the burger and almost asked for more but decided to put it together and just try it first....perfect! Note to Chef: don't change a thing.
One critique on the BLT: cut the lettuce up a little, my daughter had a tough time with it as it wanted to pull out with each bite.
The Asian salad was excellent. 
Funny thing, we almost went to City Tavern down the street to give them another shot, as we had a not so good experience there a few months ago. But, I decided to read some recent reviews first. Heads up.....Just go to Maxwell's and have a great meal and enjoyable experience.......every time.
Consistency is a good word to describe this place."}
{"text":"Love eating at Maxwell's.  They have a great ribeye sandwich that is hard not to get every time.  Good salads, burgers, and fries.  The only negative is usually a wait."}
