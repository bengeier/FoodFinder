{"text":"Passing thru Pittsburgh from Detroit to VA and stopped at this tiny out of the way diner via GPS with no advance. Amazing!  Little neighborhood diner with excellent food!  Fresh and lovingly prepared. Don't do fast food drive thru on vacation. Find these incredible spots and make a memory. Did also get a hoagie for carry out they looked that good!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, you walk in the place you belong, this is NOT one of your up town houtie totdy places this is a real Diner, The food is outstanding, had a Wet Judy  couldn't get enough so stuffed a Thick cut bacon egg and cheese on top of that would have stayed and ate more but I have to work, just saying I've been to a lot of diners, restaurants and overall slop chutes in my 30 plus years as a Cross country trucker, but this place is one of the BEST I've been to"}
{"text":"Wow!  Don's diner is by far my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Pittsburgh!  Located off the beaten path underneath a bridge. A little out of the way if you don't live in the area but totally worth it.   A small diner with 5 or 6 booths and counter seats.  Once you read the menu you will feel like you stepped back in time a little bit, because the prices are so cheap!  $1 for beverages such a hot chocolate, coffee, and tea.  A stack of 3 pancakes will only cost you $4.50, and they are big fluffy delicious pancakes.  They use fresh, never frozen blueberries!  You can watch Don cook all your food.  His daughter and other young lady that work there are very friendly and energetic.  My mother, my sister, and I all ate breakfast for only $18.75! (And we ate a ton of food).  My personal favorites are the Ruben sandwich, French fries with a side of gravy, they have homemade soups that are always delicious, blueberry pancakes, and some hash browns.  Not all at the same time of course :)  And you will find something to eat because they have a large selection of breakfast items and lunch items such as burgers and sandwiches.  (Menu pictures attached) If you are looking for a no frills place with delicious food and friendly kindhearted people, head over to Don's!"}
{"text":"I love this diner! They have some pretty unusual hours, but when they are open the food is spectacular! My boyfriend and I always go and get the cheese burgers and oh my are they amazing. The meat is so nice and juicy and you can definitely tell it's fresh and not frozen. The bun is big and soft and it's so good. The fries here are made fresh as well and are so much better than the fries at other restaurants in the area. The waitresses are very nice and diligent workers. The breakfast is great, and I've also ordered a tuna melt before which is very good as well. The prices are very affordable as well, 2 people can order lunch or breakfast for less than 15$  Highly recommend if you're ever driving by and they're open!"}
{"text":"Don's Diner is a very well kept secret.  I first heard about it from a very friendly waitress at one of my favorite spots and then again from a personal friend - both highly recommended Don's Diner for breakfast.  In trying to get more info online, it's slim pickings.  Thank goodness I found a review from Munch at the Post-Gazette so I could be prepared to order the good stuff:   http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/life/munch/munch-goes-to-dons-diner-on-the-north-side-139980/  First, if you have no idea where this place is, it is, quite literally, under a bridge.  If your GPS seems to be taking you on a wild goose chase, you're getting closer.  There is a convenient parking lot just next to the building.  It looks small from the outside and inside it's even smaller.  Just a few booths and some seats at the counter.  I was glad I had asked my friend before I got there if it was cash only because a sign above the register tells you that as you walk in.  I took a seat at one of the cozy booths, just next to some of Pittsburgh's finest and waited for my friends.    I browsed the menu for my options but had my mind made up once I saw the pancake special: two pancakes, two eggs, bacon and potatoes.  Thanks to Munch's review, I knew to upgrade my bacon to the thick cut.  I also added some Texas toast for my dippy eggs.  The fluffy pancakes arrived first.  I apologized to my friends for not waiting until their food arrived to dig in, but they forgave me when I offered to share these deliciously light clouds that needed just a few drops of syrup.  The bacon upgrade was also a key component to making this a great breakfast.  My two eggs were gigantic.  The yolks were the largest I have ever seen and made for some great dipping.  My friend wondered why the home fries were so good and I had to tell her it was because I saw Don preparing them at the grill and brushing butter on top.  It gave them a beautiful golden hue and the most divinely tasty crunch.  Even with my extras, upgrades and coffee my bill was still under $10.    I want to highly recommend Don's Diner to anyone I meet - but then I don't.  I think many local regulars want to keep Don's to themselves and I understand; I now want to keep this secret all to myself.  So I guess I should say I don't mind recommending it...as long as you don't tell anyone else."}
{"text":"Went to Don's Diner for breakfast today, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a no frills place where the service is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is excellent. I will certainly be returning again."}
{"text":"An awesome diner with fantastic food in a quintessentially Pittsburgh location. Down the bottom of Woods run, if you pass signs for Alcosan you've gone too far. Under a bridge, by the river, and a stones throw from downtown. Don, Angel, and Marcie that run the place, wait the tables, they do everything. Love it.  The food is all cooked by don- on a flat griddle to perfection right in the middle of the restaurant. Sitting st the counter, you're in the kitchen. The place is clean, the people are nice, the food is really good.  French toast, pancakes, burgers look good, breakfast is for sure delicious. My hot sausage omelette was amazi"}
{"text":"Get the Wet Judy as you like. Great little place. Home Cooked good and a nice family. They're movie stars too! Ask your friendly server bout dat."}
{"text":"Wow as in wow on this diner It's under a bridge here in Pittsburgh and it is worth a drive here from anywhere *cash only  I arrived 8 min to closing with the need to feed a hungry bunch No worries I was warmly greeted  Sat at the counter the guy there could see I was frazzled and offered me ice water As I began to relax I could clearly see this was a very special little diner a throwback to yesteryear  In how it looks and even the prices The grill is behind the counter There are booths and the counter Ok let's get down to the food  My order  Eggs and cheese on croissants Bacon eggs and cheese on English muffin Egg and bacon  on toast  Blueberry pancakes which are sold by the cake what a grand idea  $2.00 for a beautiful Devine fluffy stuffed with blueberries pancake I do believe it was the best I have ever eaten.  Its worth a drive here from anywhere for this straight food Everything is ala carte I ordered homefries for all the breakfast sammies. Another delish item I knew the husband and son needed lunch so I added two turkey sammies  Everyone working so friendly  The gentleman carried my food to the car  And I swear I kid you not all this food was under 40 dollars These my yelping readers is the real deal good straight honest food if you want the best sammies the best pancakes"}
{"text":"First of all, sit at the bar and watch the master work.  How did I know it was Don? Well, the waitress yelled, \"Hey Don! Are you going to come out and cook for these people or what?!\" As she started to toast the bread and threw my home fries and my husband's hash browns on the flat top.  Second of all, order the coffee. No, there isn't anything special about it, but it is full bodied and just plain good.  On to the food... I ordered the hot sausage/egg/cheese on Italian toast with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The toast was perfectly thick and crunchy, the sausage was hot and tasty, the eggs were fluffy, and most importantly the cheese was gooey and melty (I despise when I order a breakfast sandwich and the cheese isn't melted, come on man!). The home fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. My husband ordered two eggs over easy, sausage links, hash browns, and rye toast. I can't speak for anything he had except the hash browns which were awesome. Crispy and crunchy almost like a French fry on the outside and soft in the middle.   After sitting by the flat top, I've already eyed up what I'll be ordering on my next few stops: a blueberry pancake, the thick cut bacon, hash browns of my own, eggs over easy, a cheese burger, and the whole left side of the menu.   5 stars? Yes, because it's the best diner I've encountered in Pittsburgh to date. Yes, because it is clean (even the condiment caps were cleaned!). Yes, because the service was friendly. Yes, because I didn't smell like I was just sitting in a diner for 45 minutes. Yes, because our tab was $14. And yes, because the food is delicious!  Don's, the best kept secret in Pittsburgh, FTW!"}
{"text":"You'll feel like you've been lost for hours getting to Don's Diner. Under this bridge? Yes. Around this bend? You got it. Through this creepy industrial park? Let the smell of fried bacon be your guide.  Don's is tucked underneath a bridge and looks unassuming. The cuisine: also unassuming, yet delicious. Upon seeing breakfast sandwiches listed for $2.25 my friend chuckled and said, \"I'll take 7.\" Most expensive sandwich on the menu was $7.  We took our seats and ordered a Wet Judy and a typical egg breakfast. Both were delicious and I had a craving for a Wet Judy for DAYS. So much messy egg goodness on a sandwich. Upgrade to the thick cut bacon if you get it. Which you should. It's a new favorite.  Waitress came over and said she didn't recognize us and asked if it was our first time. You betcha. She showed us laminated pictures of a film that was shot at the booth to our left and explained how long her father had owned the place.   Place is cash only, but nothing less should be expected from Don. Thank you for a delicious, classic, Pittsburgh brunch. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"What is there to say, by far one of Pittsburgh best kept secrets. Hands  down better than Pamelas, Delucas, and Kelly O. Reminds me of 7Cees in Bloomfield before Jeannie had to close. So with that being said I tip my hat to Don and his staff."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago for lunch with my father and goddaughter.  Don's diner isn't the type of place you just happen across due its location and so if you ever end up here it was because you actually planned on eating here.  I ended up finding out about it through another Yelper and since it had good Yelp ratings and was somewhat close to my house I figured that I would give it a chance.  The inside of the diner is quite interesting with a lunch counter on one side with all of the cooking done behind it. Then the other side has plastic booths (they remind me of my high school cafeteria) with some old photos on the wall.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with breakfast and so I ordered a  3 egg omelette with capicola, pepper jack cheese, onions and peppers with sides of hash browns and rye toast while my father went with a sausage and pepper sandwich with fries.  My omelette came out at the same time as my dads sandwich (no fries though) and looked good.  It was cooked nicely and I liked the flavor of the capicola in the omelette with the onions and peppers.  While the cheese was pretty obvious in the omelette I don't think that I could have identified it as pepper jack as there wasn't any spice to it.  By the time that I had finished my omelette my dads fries were still not there and so the waitress told us she would comp them but still deliver them whenever they were ready.  Finally a minute or two later they were ready and came out to the table piping hot.  Whenever it comes time to pay Dons diner is a little weird from the standpoint that I never saw a check.  I just went up to the register and paid hoping that everything on the check was correct.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I thought that my food was tasty and that it was good value for what we got.  Be forewarned that Dons diner is cash only though!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 10 years, best breakfast food you'll ever find! Don is such an amazing cook, I prefer this diner over any chain restaurant or other diners."}
{"text":"Great little dirty diner! Got the pancake & egg deal & upgraded to the thick cut bacon with thick Italian toast. Excellent!  Family owned & operated. Close @ 1:00 so get lunch in early! Def try this place!"}
{"text":"Don's Diner is definitely one of Pittsburgh's most hidden gems. Too me at least it was in the middle of no where. The service was fast and staff super friendly. I had eggs and bacon on a english muffin with home fries. It was totally delicious, And definitely the best diner anywhere around. My wife has gone here and brought food out for us several times, But this was the first time I was there. I was super impressed with the service and the high quality of the food. I would say it is worth the trip from anywhere you are, As the food is that good. I will definitely be a regular here as you won't be able to keep me away. By far the best diner anywhere around hands down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast today. We were greeted by smiling faces, and continued to get excellent service throughout our meal. The food was amazing, and the service was just as great! Highly recommend for you to try out this hidden gem under the bridge."}
{"text":"This little diner is located between 3 bridges one of which is a railroad bridge. Use GPS when getting here since Chateau St is closed partially due to construction.  There is side parking near the diner. The place is very small. There was no one at the counter but I managed to snag one of the last remaining booths.   The staff is very friendly and helpful. I decided to opt for breakfast. I went with a 3 egg omelet and had my choice of cheese. Prices are extremely reasonable but most everything I was told is ala carte. This includes lunch sandwiches. She said that if I want 2 eggs then I would save $.75.   I ordered a side of rye toast for $.50 to go with it. They served a very good coffee while I watched them prepare my omelette.  I got it in about less than 10 minutes and liked the fact that they put vegetables on top of the omelette as well as inside. It was indeed very good. The waitress came around continually to make sure my coffee was always full.  After I finished I was waiting around for my check. I finally had to ask an employee for it. It was then that I learned you pay directly at the register. I knew this place was cash only but I thought it would be a little confusing for me to figure out a tip if I don't know what my total bill is. BTW coffee is only $1.00 and has unlimited refills. Hot tea is also available. They serve juices as well but no free refills on that.  So I went to the register and was thrilled to learn my check was just under $7.00! Not bad for a 3 egg omelet and rye toast. I found coming mid morning gave me the opportunity to choose between breakfast and lunch. Again as I noted, everything is ala carte so if you want a lunch sandwich be prepared to pay extra for any sides.  Nice little diner at affordable prices. Take out service is available since I saw the lady at the register had a bag for another customer."}
{"text":"Croissant as a bread option is the bomb! I ordered spinach mushroom omelette with onions and pepper. Very good service, reasonably price. Mood under the bridge was very pittsburghry! Love it."}
