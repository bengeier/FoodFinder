{"text":"When I tried to go there for dinner with friends, they kicked us out from the table and made us go to the corner.  The place was mostly empty, but they reasoned they needed the table in case a large family came in.  I had to leave.  I'm autistic, so I don't like get treated like a second class citizen no matter what the reason.  I don't think I can go back, and I'll probably not be able to get some sleep tonight."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you. This is what I'd call a hidden gem. Incredible bbq. The staff is super friendly too. Make sure you get the nachos worth brisket."}
{"text":"I love the Grouper Fish dinner, in this restaurant! It is cooked inside of a bag, and it is seasoned just right. It was served with a delicious house salad, and fresh vegetables.  The Grouper Fish sandwiches are great ,also. But all the food items are overpriced. The service was slow, as well. The atmosphere was more bar, than restaurant.  The best days to go, are on days that Sporting events are held downtown. Be sure to call ahead, to make sure they are open."}

{"text":"We r here from out of town. The service was great. Everyone super friendly. And the food was even better. So many great choices on the menu. I went with the bbq beef sandwich. My husband had ribs and kids went with chicken fingers and bleu cheese burger. Nothing left over. The music was great and local. Serious had a great time. Oh fries - amazing!  Oh rice and beans, even better. Really. Go there now!"}
{"text":"2 Dollar Domestics, 3 Dollar Bombs!!   If you like to drink cheap before Indians games than this is the place to go.  A group of my friends and I go here one friday a month before the tribe game and love it.  The same beer next door at the Thirsty Parrot would be 5 bucks.  The bartenders and owner is great.  I have heard the food is good as well.  Another thing is this place gets some killer bands to perform all the time.  Next time you go down for a game check it out!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried fish I've ever had. Service was impeccable and the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great food, great selection of beer, great music, friendly people.  Is this heaven?  A Cleveland must stop. My advice, go for the brisket."}
{"text":"There weren't many patrons here the night I stopped in to see a singer/songwriter from Boston; but I didn't expect it to be sold out, either.  Music was really good. The food was good for bar food; and the menu was HUGE. The owner was very friendly, which was coo. The bartender was very good. Never had to ask her for a drink and kept my water glass full, too. It's a nice alternative to the Beachland, as I like smaller venues anyway. Parking was easy and definitely going back! There is a lot right next to this building, paid $5 to park all night."}
{"text":"We recently had the pleasure of going to Wilberts after an Indians game. One of the locals recommended it. I'm glad he did. It is a truly authentic local bar with knowledgable bartenders that are fast, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile. The owner was nice enough to give us 2 tshirts and prepare us a shot. There is a live band and very nice crowd. I'd definitely recommend this little gem. From 2$ beers to chocolate martini's u can't go wrong. We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Did not Eat there.  We went at 430 on an NBA Playoff night - but the place was not crowded. In fact, there were a couple of empty tables as we arrived. Those host (maybe a bartender or server?) asked us how many. We said two and he grabbed menus and walked towards a table. He placed the menus on the two-top and walked away to serve another table.  The menus slid off onto the floor. We stood there, dumbfounded, for about thirty seconds while he waited onthe adjacent table, his back to us. A lady at the neighboring table (not the one he was serving, but another one) huffed and shrugged her shoulders to me on our behalf. I shrugged back, then said, \"I can spend my money a lot of p-laces, but it won't be here.\"  Then, we left.  Unreasonable in about four different ways: A) No true greeting as simple as, \"Welcome to Wilbers\" B) Clumsily setting down menus and not seeing to it that we were even seated. C) Walking away without any sort of closer/hold-over (\"I'll tell your server you're here\" or \"I'll be with you in just a second/moment/minute/two minutes...\" D) The prolonged time of not noticing his error/nor caring to make amends.  Like I said, the3 place wasn't busy. - and if I could help it making his job easier, I ent out the door and spent my money at AJ Roccos - and will make sure to do it every time I watch a CAVS game in Cleveland.  Not a big deal, I'm sure...then again, if you give me $35 a year, I'll agree with your business model of not giving a damn."}
{"text":"If you and your family happen to find yourselves in downtown Cleveland waiting in line at the Winking Lizard  for a table and you hear a deep resonating voice exclaiming no wait!, $2 dollar beers ---kids eat free!  Follow the voice and allow the super nice man behind the voice to escort you to a wonderful place to eat, drink and be merry--the kids will have fun too!  I cannot believe we never heard of this place --until the voice!!!  Great food!  Friendly service!  All around a great find.  I almost hated to post this because I want to keep it all to myself  :) Had the ribs ( $10 on special) comes with a side salad and homemade balsamic vinaigrette on special and my wife had the chicken quesadilla!  Had a Back in Black IPA and the wife had a Uinta Pumpkin ale both on draft.  We walked in and sat down 1 hour before the Monsters game on a Saturday night (party of thirteen!).  FYI the domestic beers were $2 and the craft beers on draft were $4.  Nicki the server was awesome!  They told us they have live music as well but this night they were playing a jukebox.  As he was escorting us to the restaurant the voice told us we would love it--he was right!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in after game 6 of world series was over to peacefully grab a beer.  Was SCREAMED at immediately.. \"We're Closed!!!!\"  Odd, but whatever.  Then escalated to \"YOU BETTER LEAVE NOW\" and threats.  Oh I get it..Its because I'm wearing Cubs stuff and we just handed your Indians their own assess and your feelings were hurt.  None of the talkers were man enough to do anything about me though except talk talk talk.  Guess what.. I was right too.  The Cubs would win again the next day, and now I'm celebrating the WORLD SERIES while you aren't.  I win. You lose."}
{"text":"Great place before a Tribe game! Great drink prices with $2 domestic tallboys ($4-$5 next door) and $3 grape/cherry bombs. And if you're feeling crazy their Irish car bombs are 5 bucks. Can't beat that for being right next to the stadium! Also, I hear the food is very good but have yet to try. Definitely my go-to pre-game for the Indians."}
{"text":"Wilbert's is a nice spot to catch a live show. There's a tiny stage in the front of the bar. I don't believe there are usually tickets sold, just a cover--but it is a cover that is usually worth it. The bands are usually blues or nationally touring indie singer/songwriter types. I've never tried the food, and the drinks are on par with the look/feel of the place, a laid back bar to hang out with your friends. If it weren't for the quality live music, this bar wouldn't be on my radar.   Wilbert's is tough to find from the street, so make sure you know where you're going before you leave."}
{"text":"This a our favorite place to hang out before Tribe, Cavaliers & Monsters games. I wish more people knew & or respected what this place has to offer. In fact if we lived downtown, I know that we would be there a lot more often. This place it right next to the Thirsty Parrot and if it wasn't for the Parrot's patio I know that Wilbert's would be the place to be for everyone.  Either way this place has an exceptional draft selection 9 times out of 10 for a reasonable price. Before any game, they have $2 domestics and $3 Jameson's. Hard to beat. Their bar tenders are friendly and when not too busy they are good guys to chew the fat with.  Food isn't outstanding but its good and fair. And not to mention they are generous on their ingredients.  But the best thing that they offer is their live music. They always have good acts coming through putting on a shows whether it's a backed house or playing in front of 6 people.  I'm glad we found this place and hope that others realize how special it is as well."}
{"text":"I wish there were a way to give 1/2 stars.  This place wasn't quite a 3 but definitely not a 4.  The music on this particular night was AWFUL, but the drinks were good and the food was solid.  The owner came over and sat with us for a while (probably because we had 4 pretty girls at our table) and he was nice enough.  I'm guessing this place is amazing depending on what night you go.  I'd give it another shot, but the music is very important and on this particular night the band was laughably bad.  Nothing worse than another horrible rendition of \"Superstition.\"   I wonder how they vet their entertainment."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar, which cool if you know going in.  Not clean, food was decent, beer is cold.  But, they water down there whiskey, I had a double of Jack straight out of the bottle and I know it was watered down."}
{"text":"Great place to go before an Indians or Cavs game!  We were there last night and had a wonderful time before the Indians game.  The food is fairly basic -- sandwiches, wraps, wings -- but everything is good and priced well. There are some great beer specials.   We had 16 ounce cans for $3 each, much less than we would pay at the game!  The waitress was quick to take our orders, bring our drinks and checked on us frequently even on a very busy night.  Give Wilbert's a try either before a game or even just for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"GREAT bar life! i came here on a thursday to watch some preseason football (Go Falcons) and i was truly impressed by how awesome of a place this is! its a live music restaurant venue, who knew the two went so well together. Reminds me of a typical new york bar, with the music performers in the corner, mind you i DID not listen to music i was too into the game. BUt let me get down to the important part, the food!!  Had the Big Ass Burritos (no quarter in the swear jar for me thats the actual name of the burrito)!!! They werent kidding, they were HUGE, and their homemade salsa was to die for! We also tried their chili bombs, fried chilies stuffed with chorizo?! AMAZING SAUCE! For my main course i had their jerk chicken sandwich, which for me was a little OVER seasoned but the meat was cooked perfectly and i enjoyed myself. The vibe and atmosphere made the meal that much better, service was upbeat and friendly, never had to look for a bartender or waitress, everyone was on deck. Nice long bar and TVs placed accordingly, i really enjoyed my experience here. I would love to come back and catch a show!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night 12/16/2016. It closed at 12am and not 2am on a Friday night. Kinda odd. It's a whole in the wall type of place. I won't lie, I have the BBQ burger and it was top quality!! My wife had the wings and she said she enjoyed them. The fries could have been a bit better. I will give them a 4 out of 5 on food. The place itself needs some updates. They allow local talent to perform but their stage is a bit tiny with a lot of damaged equipment they should just throw away! I came here to support OSNS group. I would come back all in all. Good beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"This place is well hidden and that's part of what I love about it.  It's nearly impossible for it to get too crowded because no one can find it.  Sucks for everyone who can't find it though because this place--and the people who work there--rock.  The service is better than you'll find in most places and the servers are the type to call you \"hon\" and \"sweetie\" not because they're sexist but because they're old.   I went on a Friday night and there was an incredible band (The Cordovas).  Wilbert's live shows are free but they'll pass around a basket at the end of the night so people can pay the band whatever they think they're worth.  (Take note, music industry.)  My husband and I tipped the band accordingly for putting on an awesome show and it was worth every penny.   Beyond that I had two ridiculous glasses of wine both filled so high I couldn't even swirl the glass, as well as some pretty decent nachos.  The nachos probably put me line for heart disease somewhere down the line but they were delicious nonetheless.   Either way, I had waaaaay too good of a time at Wilbert's--can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came here to have some great food, drinks, and socialize before a Cavs game. There's a man outside the entrance that takes our FL IDS, takes one judgmental look at us and says \"there's no way I'm letting you guys in if you're from out of town.\" Were in our 30s, but he said he \"didn't want to deal with out of state IDs\" and told us to walk away and get out. What a great way to turn away business and treat people who don't have an OHIO license. If you want to hang out at a place where people are complete jerks to you, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly stumbled upon Wilbert's while bar hopping before a Cavs game and I'm pretty sure it's Cleveland's best kept secret (okay, so I've only ever been to Cleveland once to make that claim... get off my back).  The live music and TVs are what brought us in, but the prices are what got us to stay. Two Jager Bombs for $6? Two domestic beers for $5? You can't beat that! Plus, it was super close to The Q, but yet not at all crowded with fans. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"WIlberts is without a doubt the best bar in the Gateway district of CLE. Michael the owner is one of a kind, plus how can you beat $2 Tall Boys and $3 bombs. Stop in before a tribe game and get a nice buzz before heading into the stadium or just watch the game from Wilberts and its crowd"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was nice and quick. Got the BBQ pulled pork quesadilla and it was delicious and messy. Great place to stop before an Indian's game if you are looking for cheap bear and a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Creme Brulee like scrambled eggs, A Blonde brownie swimming in ice cream and sugar, A night at Wilbert's.  In Cleveland for work, I made desserts my mission. Suffice to say, Wilbert's was not the place. Perhaps they have better real food -- the photos of ribs and fries that others have posted are things of beauty.  The service was odd, and a little uncomfortable. There were few people there, but hey it was a Tuesday night, what could we rightly expect?  I probably won't return. But I could see how if you lived in Cleveland, this might be your home base bar. It was tricky to find, in the back of an office building -- that made it kind of an adventure to seek it out. In the summer they have a back patio area that must be quite nice, if you're having drinks."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had the big ass burrito with pulled pork and a couple beers. My bill was $16.50. How can that even be possible in downtown Cleveland? Burrito was wonderful! My friend had the nachos with pulled pork and I sample some of his and they were amazing as well. If you're off to a Cavs, monsters, tribe or unfortunate enough to attend to Browns game this place is well worth the stop."}
{"text":"I used yelp to search for live music and Wilberts popped up immediately. The Friday we went was an open mike night for local talent - all rap.  I'm a fan of rap (I'm pretty sure XM created their Backspin channel just for me) but this particular show was not my jam.  Difficult to find.  We entered from Huron and then needed to walk all the way through the building to the back - no signage at all.  Interior of Wilberts is very dark.  The table we sat at was dirty and sticky, even after it was cleaned.    Relatively empty interior, nothing like the pictures.  People were drinking but I did not see any food being served (their menu showed they were serving food).  We finished our beers and moved on."}
{"text":"I really like this place!!! For a downtown spot(so close to the stadium and arena) you can't beat the prices! They have game day specials $2 domestic bottles and their rib dinner $10! The ribs were great!! Very tender! I heard their burgers are really good too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here. Had the pork nachos which were very good! I just needed 4 more people to help me since the portion size was plenty to share. Had a budweiser and a shot of fireball (or 2) which were cheaper than i expected for downtown. Band was playing on the stage which made for a fun evening! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The nachos are great and the jambalaya is superb!  A must stop before going the the Cavs or Indians!"}
{"text":"I know the main staple before any Indians home game is next door at the Parrot.....but I encourage anyone to swing by Wilberts as well.  Quite possibly one of the more cheaper places to drink before any game.  $2 beers (domestics) and the drink specials vary.  The crowds are good and all ready for the game.  They almost always have bands on weekends and always have been solid when I have been there.  Granted, I am usually stumbling around and slurring my words.....but that just makes the Wilberts experience more enjoyable.  I also wouldnt really call it \"outdoor seating\" but more of a walkway they put chairs on.  I will also add I have never eaten here......hell, I dont even know if they have food.  This revue is solely based on beer and crowd experience. See you in April Wilberts"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks for sure. Got 2 Jager bombs and the bar tender said 6 bucks and was shocked when she said total. Beers are very cheap as well. Close walk to both Progressive and the Q. Perfect place to pregame on a budget!"}
{"text":"My dad and I were wandering around before a Tribe game looking for something quick to eat before the game. The Cavs also had a playoff game so it was pretty busy everywhere. However a man carrying a sign for Wilberts asked us if we needed help (damn tourists LOL) and said Wilberts was very busy but would try to find us a table. He did in fact squeeze us in to a very busy restaurant filled with Indians and Cavs fans with a live band playing.   It was a great and lively atmosphere! Best of all, we were greeted with a server right away and our food came out in great timing ESPECIALLY considering how busy they were.   They even catered to my ketogenic diet needs as I ordered a burger with no bun and substituted veggies for the fries. The burger wasn't anything to write home about...a little flat actually. But my dad ordered the \"big ass burrito\" and let me tell you- it was a BIG ASS BURRITO!!   Good food, good service, good pricing, good atmosphere. Thanks to the man outside who flagged us down!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Cleveland. 2 dollar domestic 16 oz cans of beer. Great food especially the big ass burrito and the fries. Close to the Q arena and Progressive field. Live music in the evening. Highly recommended if your in the neighborhood to give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a Cavs Watch Party! The gentleman who greeted us at the door told us to come in and make ourselves at home. The server was sociable and knowledgeable when it came to the drink and food menu. I enjoyed my Big Ass Burrito, but wished I had ordered the BBQ Beef Brisket Burger. I had a bite of my husbands and it was Amazing. We will definately be back and look forward to trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wilbert's is awesome. I usually go here to pregame before Cleveland sporting events. On Friday's they host live bands, which is pretty cool. The drinks are super cheap and the bartenders are very sweet."}
{"text":"Great food and a huge portion. Cheap beer and good eats. Our waiter/manager was awesome. Thanks for a great time before the cavs game. Merry Xmas."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! As my friend and I were walking down Huron looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and drink before the Black Keys concert at the QL Arena, an employee of Wilbert's started yelling to promote this place and grab business. We were impressed and intrigued so we followed him through the building and were pleasantly surprised when we ended up in Wilbert's. With the server's suggestions, we ordered a couple drinks, Chicken Quesadillas and a House Salad. The server was very friendly and showed her care by being attentive and helpful, something that is rare in most restaurants and bars that I have visited.   Thinking that the food would be similar to what one typically finds in a bar, again, we were pleasantly surprised. The food had wonderful flavor. The homemade dressings for the very freshly prepared salad were delicious. The Quesadillas were delightful and the homemade salsa was extraordinary. When we were finished eating we were approached by Mike, the owner, who sat with us for a few minutes and shared his story with us. We were impressed with him and his passion for his business and life were shining through his friendly conversation.   This visit was a definite highlight of our two day trip to Cleveland. We are going to definitely make it back to Wilbert's in the future, hopefully on many occasions, not only to eat their fabulous food but also to see some musical acts.   If you are in Cleveland and need a great place to eat and hang out, please try Wilbert's. You will not be disappointed. If you are going to any of the events or games in the area, this is a very convenient place to visit before or after your event. I highly recommend this hidden Gem!"}
{"text":"Best place EVER! After an amazing tribe win of 22 straight I wanted to check out Wilberts which Is right next to Thirsty Parrot! Live band, full bar, and a great food menu was clutch. I ordered the grouper sandwich with fries (only $1 extra instead of chips) and my friend got the quesadilla. Both were so delicious! The grouper was so flavorful and cooked just right.   Hands down my new fave tribe spot before & after games. Did I mention $5 stoli vodkas?! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  I have season tickets for the Tribe  and walked by this place a million times.  I decided to give it a try and i really liked it.  2 dollar beers, good food, and kids eat free!  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Was very chaotic (Even for a game day) . Food was not great. Wasn't the cleanest place I have been to in Cleveland. Was hoping for much more from reviews I read but with many other options like the Winking Lizard, City Tap and The Clevelander near by I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to before Indians games. They've got a slew of specials on game days and it can get you prepared for the sobering prices you'll see at the stadium. You can find some domestic cans and bottles for $2, while bombs will cost you $3. Check this place out with friends and you can all easily have a solid buzz for less than $20 a piece.   The food here is pretty good too if you find yourself needing a snack before the game. I had a brisket sandwich which I really liked. It's definitely worth the small upcharge to get fries instead of chips. They have a bunch of tables and booths inside as well as a couple standing tables outside on their patio.  I like to find a spot outside if possible to socialize and observe the fans.   The downside to this place is how busy it can get. It's in close proximity to the stadium, so it's a go-to for many spectators. I've typically seen 2 or 3 bartenders working and they can serve up the drinks pretty quickly.  The patio is small and often very crowded. With all the bodies that cram inside the building, it can sometimes get pretty hot in the summer months. I'd find myself sweating and their AC just couldn't keep up. Regardless, I still love this spot and I'll keep coming for every game."}
{"text":"Awesome chips & salsa and Southwestern lasagna, but they're hardly ever open.  Usually only open around events - which makes the parking very costly."}
{"text":"12-15 $2 drafts for crafts beer week (normally, they're $4 which is very reasonable for Cleveland): stone IPA, 3 or 4 fall beers (southern tier, Paulaner Oktoberfest-Märzen, Thirsty Dog), young's chocolate, a thirsty dog.   BEST Cleveland Beer Week deal ever !   It was my first show at Wilbert's (it was free!) and the first band went on at 8pm as scheduled. The bar itself closed right after the last band finished at 10:30ish.   Unfortunately for the bands and the bar, there was about an equal amount of customers and band members and staff. Service at the bar was great."}
{"text":"This is the place to go prior to Cleveland Indians and/or Cavs games. Best pre-game happy hours around. $3 tall cans of domestics. Food is pretty good too, but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is definitely divey, but they aren't pretending to be anything else. I love meeting friends here prior to Tribe games, as it's cheap and directly across from the field. I always have a good time, although it can get REALLY cramped before games. They staff well to prevent lines from backing up too far. Bring cash and get your beer from the ladies working the cooler bins directly inside the patio door."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Wilberts. Any time I am going to a baseball game and want cheap food and drinks beforehand, I head to Wilberts every time. Three words: pulled pork nachos. They are the most delicious nachos I have ever had. For about 10 bucks you can get a huge portion of nachos covered in cheese, beans, salsa, and BBQ pulled pork. It's enough to share with 3-4 people (even though you'll want the whole thing for yourself).       They also have $2 domestic beers- always ask for the 16 oz cans as they are the same price as the 12oz cans/bottles. They also have $3 bombs and I believe $4 fireball shots. Then you can walk right over to the field from there!       They don't have the best tvs, so I don't recommend staying here to watch the game, but it's a great place to fill up on cheap beer and food before you head elsewhere. It gets super crowded a couple hours before games until they start, then pretty much clears out."}
{"text":"While sitting on the Thirsty Parrot deck I always wondered what Wilbert's deal was.   It seemed like a dive bar, full of bad ass, uneducated, we're better then you, tools that were just there to mock the overcrowded, yuppie crowd paying $$$ for beers on the deck of the Parrot.  Boy was I wrong.  I finally decided to hit Wilbert's before a ball game to see if the $2 bottle beer deal was for real.  An hour and a half and 8-10 beers later I realized that I am enjoying myself, a lot.    The place is pretty big and gets a nice crowd for all home games but not to a point where its annoying.  They also run food specials, I opted with the nacho and the darn thing was the size of my head.  The next time I went there we all got sandwiches and let me tell you, not bad, not bad at all.  Service was slow as expected on game day but we got there early enough and anticipated a packed house.    From now on I split my time between Wilbert's and The Thirsty Parrot, usually depending on how nice it is outside because the deck at the Parrot is fantabulous.  I hear they do live music on non-ballgame days but my weekend options are usually too open to include Wilbert's just for music.    so if you were like me sitting on the Parrot patio, brave it and go to Wilbert's.  Table is your best bet but if there's room at the furthest end of the bar by the bathrooms, that would be best servicewise.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been to Wilberts several times since me and my boyfriend started dating. Before we would go to cavs or monsters games we eat a little and drink plenty. During those months it was slower so we could talk and eat no problem. It was our favorite thing to do. Then this summer my experience went down hill. My boyfriend works for the Indians and so I go to a lot of games. Before the games at 7:10 its great to get some $2 beers before the game and spend an arm and a leg.   After a game I went with my best friend we ordered food and drinks and waited for my boyfriend to come. Our waitress Linda was rude and when he got there he ordered 2 beers and she only gave him one, he just didn't want to be a bother by making her make several trips and was going to pay for the two but I instead gave him the second half of mine. She didn't bother to ask if we needed anything else.  *****THIS REALLY TICKED ME OFF******  Double date to the Indians game before the 7pm game me and my boyfriend and my friends decided to hit up Wilberts before the game. It was busy and we did like everyone else and waited for a table. A very nice gentleman who worked there was helping the people waiting by keeping tabs of the tables. HE WAS WONDERFUL. We ate prior to going, but I planned to spend money drinking plenty before the game. The gentleman let us sit down and we were greeted by the waitress. We said we weren't planning to get any food but we were going to drink. She then stated that we can't sit there and not order food. I simply stated we were not informed of that rule. I explained 6 months ago I had back surgery and couldn't stand long and that sitting was key for me. She didn't care and walked off. IT WAS LINDA AGAIN! So again it was busy she was running around like crazy so we decided to take it upon ourselves to get our drinks so that we weren't a burden. When she finally approached us after ignoring us she asked if we wanted anything and I stated we already got it ourselves but thank you. She went on to yell at us and say that we HAVE to get it from her if we want to drink. I said well you didn't tell us that. She stormed off and complain to the gentleman who seated us. WE could see her clearly talking about us. She kept passing us I help my hand up for her attention and she kept ignoring us. So my friend went to the bar to get his drink himself. She finally came over and I said it's ok he is getting it himself. She ran up to him and yelled at him and made him sit down! Seriously????   LINDA IS A HORRIBLE WAITRESS!!!!! DO NOT LET HER BE YOUR SERVER.  The food is great, the drinks are cheap :), The atsmoshpere is fun, the bartenders are fantastic and for all that I give great ratings but Linda is seriously the worst. AVOID HER!"}
{"text":"If you have an out of state license and are younger but legal to drink you're screwed because the staff is too dumb to tell the difference between a real ID and fake ID. The owner is a complete idiot. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"5 Stars simple because the service was great and the place was clean. But it really got good when I ordered the ribs. Absolutely, hands down, without a doubt the best ribs I've ever had. Will be stopping in this place again when in town."}
{"text":"In addition to being a blues music venue and CLE institution forever, Wilbert's is a very good spot for pre and post event drinks at Gateway. Least expensive drinks on the block and great music after the game with plenty of TV's for keeping tabs on whatever else you're following. Food is good and menu diverse as well. Don't let the blues bar vibe fool you, they do a nice job here. We heard a band after game last night playing funk and zydeco. Much more character than the Jimmy Buffet wanna be dive next door or the run of the mill sports bars around the corner."}
{"text":"Wilbert's definitely is an experience. From the moment you walk in and see the eclectic decor complete with leg lamp, You realize this is a place that's about a good time. Only problem with this place is there are too many places to look. The bar feels divey, yet the preset tables feel more restaurant like. The food was fairly good & proportions are large. And anyway who can pass up $4 Jameson??"}
{"text":"Went to watch the rally yesterday here and have a drink. They have a projector and tvs, which are great for all sports games. Great location for Indian or Cav's games. Located right next to the Thirsty Parrot off of East 9"}
{"text":"The owners here are EXCELLENT!! They are honest, hardworking people who care about making your experience great.  The food is delicious and really hit the spot (we had the brisket burger ).  We're not from Cleveland but would come out of our to stop by here again.  Great food, atmosphere and people working here!  More businesses should adopt this business model.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here was really great. It was like surprisingly great. I visited this place before attending an event and was one of the first customers that day. This place is not the best looking place, but it's a decent sports bar with Cleveland sports teams playing of multiple big screens.   I had the chicken wings with dirty rice and it was the bomb! My boyfriend had the quesadilla that he really liked and my friend had the 9.99 rip dinner, which he devoured! We left full and satisfied, I definitely will recommend this place."}
{"text":"There a few times when you are walking around in a new town looking for a brew and bite and stumble across a true gem hidden in the rough.  Great food, perfect prices, check them out!"}
{"text":"Awful ownership did not allow me in because I have an out of state ID. I am almost 23 years old and I asked to speak to the owner I offered multiple forms of identification and he was absolutely rude. They could have called the cops to verify it and chose to lose business instead. Will never be going back.wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and were looking for a place to go. Saw this place and decided to give it a try. Great decision. The place was very bar looking and good atmosphere. Decided to sit at the bar and after some talking with bar tender to get recommendations of what to drink all decided on various beers. They have several to choose from and enjoyed very much the IPA chosen.  Bartender was great, suggested other places to go around the city and and gave us information about restaurant. Unfortunately was not hungry for smoke own meats so if go back will give their food a try.  If your a local and have not tried or like me in from out of town search this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, and the owner sat with us and shared his jambalaya!! I love this place!!!"}
