{"text":"Sids is underrated on Yelp.  Visited this spot twice in a week and had good experiences both times.  Had the scrambled egg breakfast and added a short stack of pancakes on my first week.  All of the food was good and tasty.  On my second visit, I had the meatloaf and enjoyed that as well, although I wasn't too much of a fan of the broccolini (overcooked a tad?).  I'm not sure why this place only gets two stars, it's certainly better than that."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We were in town for a few days for a convention and  ate here more than once. First time was fine, but the times after got progressively worse. Slow service, mediocre food, servers that act so bothered to do their job. Always took forever to be acknowledged and the wait for our food was ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the hotel itself. Will never stay here again and if you do, I don't recommend eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Low quality, high price and service was RIDICULOUSLY slow! Did I mention my wife got food poisoning the first night we stayed in Vegas at this place!!! The food was bland as well! Go ANYWHERE else but here! I really don't like giving poor reviews but can't help it with this place!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a server to even arrive to the table. Our rather heavy-set male server was unapologetic and rude. Food was overpriced and limited in variety. Smoky interior as it's right next to the casino. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. I got the Meatloaf and it taste like cheep TV dinner. They must know this because they put a piece of Bacon on it trying to make it taste better. So come to Las Vegas go to this restaurant and order the Meatloaf TV dinner for $22 dollars. The reason why I say it's the worst restaurant is .... Not my waiter or anyone else in the whole restaurant ask me why I only ate one bite !!!!! I guess it's normal to order a $22.00 meal in this establishment and not eat it!!! Never again !!!"}
{"text":"Giant cockroaches crawling up the walls made me want to vomit what I had just eaten. This place needs to be rehauled and fumigated! Service was inexplicably slow and food was like in a high school cafeteria. When I pointed out the roaches on the walls I was told\"What do you expect? This place is old and rundown.\" So much for the staff. I think a health department inspection is badly needed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I ate at Sid's way too many times while my 10 day stay.    They advertised burger and a beer for $12 that caught our attention.  We all ordered medium and medium rare but all came well done with one side charred.  We were so hungry and ate it anyway.  Every topping was extra, $2 for a slice of krafts single?    Service was definitely not their strength, slow and unprofessional.  Went back for late night (2am) dinner, same level of service, we all ordered breakfast type food.  Eggs were not cooked properly.  Their Fruits were good tho.  Bottomeline the food and service were not worth it."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!!  This place sucks!!!  The meatloaf is salty and inedible.  I bit into two hard unknown debris hidden in the meatloaf.  The matzo ball soup literally taste like balls!!  $19 for the meatloaf, total with soup and drink was over $30.  Save your money go to a buffet instead!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not that good, but we lucked out this time with a very friendly waitress named Frankie.  She was kind, helpful and cheerful, so the 5 stars are for FRANKIE."}
{"text":"Great food 24 hours a day. Good service. Eggs Benedict are a killer.  Cherry smoked bacon a must."}
{"text":"Ate here by default as we were staying at the hotel and room service breakfast was going to take 1+ hrs. Solid breakfast but the best part by far, was our beautiful 73 year old Cuban immigrant (1966) waitress, Francisca J who took excellent care of us and provided outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I can confidently say this is the WORST restaurant I have ever been to. I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, it was very good, the food is not the problem. Absolute worst service I've ever had. The hostess literally THREW our silverware on the table, and I think I only saw my waiter twice in the hour and a half I was there. I saw many people just get up and leave because no attention was being paid to them. The restaurant was not busy at all... Ridiculous. Should have gone to McDonalds."}
{"text":"While Sid's has lots of great items on their menu, I specifically go there for the Matzo Ball Soup.  Our last server was in her 70's and she was running circles around everyone."}
{"text":"Breakfast here... Walk in, Carlos did not give us time to look over menu.. Stood by table made it very uncomfortable... Once order was taken, we notice table sticky w syrup, couldn't find Carlos anywhere.,.. Arturo saved the day, refilled coffee several times and wiped down the table... Food was brought out Carlos dropped check same time then wanted to talk about APA.. Really we would like to eat.. So breakfast not a too experience....   Dinner.... Waited 15 just about ready to walk out then bobby jean walks over.. Once she took order she was in it... Except for my coffee and check.. Food was delicious.. Home made chicken noodle soup and steak melted in mouth.. Please.. You go bobby jean"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've experienced in a very long while -- 20 minuets+, for a Cafe!.  Took forever to be served, after asking 3 people to assist.  Manager came over after and promised the food would be out shortly.  Took even longer to finally be served.  Avoid if you're hungry or have even the smallest time issue!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying in the Westgate hotel and went to eat at Sid's in the downstairs. The food was amazing! I had the meatloaf dinner and it's incredible. I'm getting hungry for it just typing about it. My wife had the roasted turkey and that was equally delicious. The food was great, the staff was super friendly and on their game and it's not expensive at all. I highly recommend this place to anyone coming out to Vegas."}
{"text":"Try the fried chicken! Mash potatoes and steamed vegetable were basic, but man the fried chicken was deliciously amazing!  Super crispy, the batter stuck to the chicken as you bit in, nice little spice flavor in the batter.  So good that I'm craving it as I'm writing this review in LA."}
{"text":"Good drop-in lunch. Was here at a convention and dropped in. Debra the server was excellent and made sure everything was perfect. Food was good and price was reasonable. No complaints."}
{"text":"Best thing about the meatloaf dinner is the mashed potatoes. The meatloaf itself tasted sour, and like it was more breadcrumbs than actual meat. Cheesy dinner roll would have been good but they microwave the heck out of it which leaves the middle of the roll rock hard."}
{"text":"Are server rob could have be nicer.. food was good.. would never go back.. done to terrible server"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Feb 8 for a light dinner. The sandwich and fresh fruit were great and the service was fast and friendly. I thought the prices were a tad too high, but seeing as how this place is in a nice casino ..."}
{"text":"I visited on recommendation from a friend.  Loved everything.  It has a wide open feel to it so you never feel crowded by the other tables.  The service staff is all very attentive and cater to every need that you may have.  Not once did our endless mimosas run out, nor did we run out of coffee. The menu has great choices to fit the needs of many dietary restrictions.  I got the cast iron baked cinnamon roll and it did not disappoint.  It comes out still warm from the oven and with a nice rich glaze on top.  I also had the California Egg skillet dish.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Clean and healthy with great flavor.  I would definitely recommend visiting."}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst service I've ever had. My husband's drink is STILL empty after 40 plus minutes. Food was okay. My dad enjoyed his tacos but the pulled pork chili was just pulled pork and beans no juice or stew at all. Our waitress passed by 7-10 times and hasn't acknowledged our empty drink cups at all. So ridiculous. Don't come here if you want good service and good food. My father and him have been here multiple times over the week and they had the same service each time. He asked another waitress for help and she just blew him off. F*CK this place. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated even though not busy.  Manager was rude to her staff - no wonder they appeared to not want to be there.  Ordered a black and blue steak sandwich with curly fries.   This was not a steak sandwich but rather a pile of reheated shaved beef with a blue cheese dressing.  Meager serving of fries.   All in all not worthy of a $5 Arby's.     Not going to return.  Westgate is NOT a four star hotel as reported - rather a dying 2 star hotel with low room rates.   Everything is way past due for replacement and the place looks tattered and old.     Nothing to recommend apart from free parking and low rates."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with the terrible food. Don't bother wasting your time or money by visiting this place. You are better off setting your money on fire.   I had the previously frozen lamb burger, which included brown and green lettuce, and elementary school cafeteria cole slaw. After only one bite of the cole slaw, the remainder stayed on the table when I left. As for the burger, if I wanted frozen I would have gone to McDonald's. Such a waste..."}
{"text":"Basically, DO NOT EAT HERE. My waiter, Robert D, was rude. He almost hit my face trying to put down a plate to the person across me!!! Who does that?! Then don't get me started on the old lady with tall curly hair that rolled her eyes at us that wanted water... Really?! It was only one glass of water!! She and him kept whispering behind our party of 9 and giving us dirty looks. I thought that they probably spit in our food.  One of the people with us ordered dessert and NEVER  get it. They obviously don't want our money. They gave us the check without even asking if we want anything else!   I walked out feeling dissatisfied.   I did talk to the Manager on my way out, Amy, and she was very nice, listened and understood. She was from Hawaii like us! Well, if you know anything about Hawaii, its about giving great Aloha service. Its called the service industry, you service people! Of not, quit your job!  The food is OK. The place is gorgeous. They just need to hire people like Amy, who know what the service industry is. FYI, gratuity is included, if it was up to me, I would have not given them anything.   We will not go back unless, by some miracle, that it gets better.   We felt like we needed to leave their restaurant and they didn't want us there. I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience when I came mid-afternoon and the server didn't seem to want to be there. He ignored my table so long that a busboy brought me a drink.   Came back the next day since this place was the only open restaurant and had Paul as my server. He seemed to take pride in his job and even jokingly sang when he delivered our food. It was a welcome 180 to the service I received the day before."}
{"text":"I have been to Sid's twice now and have had lovely meals here. While this isn't a 5 star restaurant, the average Yelp rating of 2 stars isn't an accurate reforestation. The staff here has been very friendly to me each time I've been here. The food again isn't five stars, but it's good portions and tastes good. All day breakfast is always nice. Plus you're just a few feet from the action on the Westgate casino floor. I'd say give it a shot."}
{"text":"Looking for a a quick lunch, dinner or late dinner at the Westgate Las Vegas? Then check out Sid's Cafe, they have you covered!  Typical Cafe menu with some upgrades like Shrimp Cocktail, Loaded Nachos, Salads, Soups, Sandwiches and Main dishes. Something for everyone! Oh and ALL DAY BREAKFAST!  Chef why are you writing about a Grilled Ham & Cheese sandwich, you ask! I don't know if it was because of Vegas, having a fun day or that this was the BEST Grilled Ham & Cheese I've had in a long time. Just look at the amount of Grilled Ham...super good!  But if you love seafood and Lobster, try the Lobster Roll. How good could it be, coming from a Cafe? Sid's Cafe does it right. Super soft roll, A TON of Lobster and seasoned perfectly. I have had a few Lobster Rolls in Vegas and Sid's doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"We met friends here for lunch while perusing the wares at the Antique Arms and Armor Show in the Westgate Las Vegas on 1/23/16.  Were quickly seated and our server Roger was polite, professional and attentive.  A party of four, two ladies and two men, we quickly divided into the soup(tomato bisque $7.00) and sandwich(Pastrami Reuben $16.00) camp, ladies for soup, men for the more substantial sandwiches.  Good sandwich, I had curly fries with mine and they were tasty.  Just shy of the standard for me, DZ Akins Pastrami Reuben....and quite a bit more expensive, but to be expected at a casino coffee shop.  Verdict-not bad for Las Vegas, but skip it otherwise."}
{"text":"Food was good. Place nice and clean. Just a bit of a wait. But worth it. Will be back for steak and eggs again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. Yes, the Westgate is a crappy hotel, but the food and service at Sids was a-ok. They seem to share the kitchen with the buffet, so a couple times my meal came out a bit slow. But overall the food was yummy and the price good, especially if you use the \"going green\" food credit."}
{"text":"They couldn't accommodate a group of 7, even with the whole place basically empty at the time we arrived.  So we had to sit at two different tables and they wouldn't allow us to move them together.  Orders done at same time, yet food for one table came out long enough before the second table that half of the group was done eating prior to the other half even getting food.  I ordered a simple burger, medium well.... No special requests.  It came out last, cold, charred, wayyyy overdone (over well, near burned).  Took me 10 minutes to get mayo so I could eat my burger... Only to realize it wasn't edible.  All-around horrible experience... Worst I've had in a very long time (and I think I've eaten at a Denny's fairly recently)."}
{"text":"This is the worst Resturant in the worst hotels in Vegas, not only is the food and service mediocre but as the anchor dinner in the casino it does not open until 7am and closes at 10am... Worthless"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to sit in quiet solitude without being bothered by a waiter or waitress pestering you by trying to bring you food, then this is your place.  Oh, it covers as a restaurant.  There are tables and chairs and silverware and menus and everything.  There are even hosts and busboys who stand around talking to one another.   From the outside, I would have sworn this was a place that served food.  Alas, I was wrong.  Seriously, came in here for a quick breakfast with the wife.  After 20 minutes of sitting at the table nobody came to take our order.  I looked around and hardly anybody in the restaurant had food.  When we got up to leave, the host at the front apologized, but it was pretty clear this happens a lot.  He didn't ask us to stay, didn't  go find a server or anything.  He just shrugged his shoulders and apologized."}
{"text":"I give this a three, it appears maybe this was a gaming room at one time. If not they are really serious about watching their customers as the ceiling has numerous cameras here in back room. Food wise , for the American classic it was good . The smoked bacon was delicious and cooked well. The potatoes had green and red peppers in them, I am not a fan of either so I ate the toast.  Which is good, only one starch. Husband had eggs Benedict , he gave them a 3. Staff wise it seems they are not excited or happy here , none of them are smiling that typically indicates poor management . Which might be why they all seem to have a job and not really helping each other . Stephanie our waitress was very kind and pleasant. She was also very busy . Only place at Westgate for breakfast , the decor does correspond with the pricing structure (fancy and spendy) but they need some support on Personal and teamwork. Always hope , wish the best for the crew."}
{"text":"2 stars are really only for the elegant decor and our drink server was good. The food was just ok. I ordered fried chicken and I could tell it was double fried, not fresh. Waiter didn't seem to be happy to work here. Lots of dust around the Booths. A little pricey."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch after checking in to the hotel.  We came in with a large group checking in for a conference so with that plus the fact that you're off the strip and can't walk to much... There was a long line.  No worries, they opened up another room in the back to accommodate more guests.  It was around 2pm but we skipped breakfast and were happy to see they had all day breakfast.  The food was great (hard to mess up breakfast though).  Our waitress Marie was super nice.  She picked up on clues that I was gluten free and giving my toast to my boyfriend who already had his own toast and pancakes so she brought me fruit instead.  The decor of the place was really beautiful like the rest of the hotel and the air quality was noticeably better than other hotels/restaurants.  All very friendly staff.  It was so thoughtful of her.  Would definitely come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"So... the only reason why I ended up eating here is because I thought it would be the quickest place to grab a bite before heading to a show at the Convention Center.  -Food: They have a wide selection but no one in my party of 3 were complimenting the food. In fact, my lobster pasta upset my stomach. :( -Prices: High for the quality -Ambiance: Nothing to write home about (there are way better places in Vegas) -Staff: It took longer than expected to be seated and then to get our order taken. The waitress was friendly though.  -Location: It's conveniently in the Westgate Hotel and walking distance of the Convention Center.  -Overall: Try someplace else..."}
{"text":"The food was great when we got it.  The service was sooooooo slow......  The service was so disappointing when we got there.  Then there was a sudden change when Bobbie started serving us.  She is such a delight, happy, kind, helpful and just turned everything around.  Bobbie made our lunch spectacular - Thank you Bobbie, you are a true gem to the restaurant!  If it was not for Bobbie we would have walked out."}
{"text":"Had the ham and cheese with the tomato bisque...greatness...as well as the tuna which was also great"}
{"text":"A waste of expensive real estate! !!! Food was from the buffet which is ok if you are at a buffet. When we were waiting to be seated a woman stormed out while saying the service was slow.  Our waitress thought she was funny but not so much.i believe the space  should have stayed as a high roller room. It would have been just as useful. Lol"}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here since staying at the Westgate and the food was pretty good! I like my pancakes a little more moist but they were good with butter and syrup. The biscuits and gravy was amazing! It's hard to find good biscuits and gravy. It's a little pricey but the staff is super nice. We had Scott and he was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Can't talk about the food here as of the time of this posting as it's been 30minutes and I haven't even been greeted. Will update if I ever get any food...or service.   After 40 minutes of waiting, I was able to order. I ordered the eggs Benedict, which was at best mediocre. The eggs were not that good, the hollandaise sauce was awful, the potatoes were both undercooked and over cooked and not at all crispy. The fruit slice was great however.  In the middle of the meal I finally got my water that I ordered. Over all, the meal was bad, the wait time was long (over an hour and 10 minutes to seat and eat)"}
{"text":"Worst service, waitress was unable to handle her 6 tables waited for ever for her to take our order after we were finally seated.  Hostess did not make eye contact with us for 10 mins while she did other tasks. Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Quite possible the most disappointing restaurants we ate at the whole time here in Vegas. Service is insultingly slow, food is mediocre at best, and the booths are aged and worn making them uncomfortable for the painfully long wait for any service."}
{"text":"We had the philly cheese steak and Reuben sandwiches. The price was around $15 for each which in my mind was somewhat expensive but they were very generous portions.  You could choose curly fries, slaw or fruit to go with your order . The fries were excellent and lots of them. The slaw had an Apple taste and was OK. I was disappointed with the philly as it just didn't have much flavor. The bread it was served on though was very good. The Reuben was better but nothing to write home about but again, you won't leave hungry! The ice tea was $4 which is ridiculously high.  The server was nice enough but did not check back once he delivered the food.  Atmosphere was nice and decor was nice. The food came in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars. This is the dirtiest restaurant that I have ever been to. The first day they had a 80 year old lady carrying heavy trays, that made me hate myself for eating there. The wait staff are old rude, and not considerate. We were over charged two times, my coffee cup had hard stuff in it, while the Asian old guy was pouring coffee into it, watching them dissolve  in the coffee that was supposed to be passed onto me, the second cup had lip sticks on it, and had to ask everything  I needed at least three times. The breakfast here was a torture. Don't go."}
{"text":"Just wanted a nice lunch with my kids and aside from the nice lady at the desk and the lady that brought us our drinks, the experience was horrible. Our waitress was the reason and 0nly reason, every answer that I gave with her questions felt like a burden. Ruin my hotel stay"}
{"text":"SIDS has great food with outstanding service.   Gregorio was our waiter and he greeted us with a huge smile and had our breakfast out in the blink of an eye.  SIDS is the place to go for friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross. The first time here my friend and I got breakfast... My waffle was hard as a rock and cold. I asked if they would make me a new one and he said yes, but then forgot about it so by the time it came back out, it was cold again. They forgot to bring the fruit compote out with it too, so I had to remind them of that. Next, we had dinner a couple nights later... I ordered the chicken lollipops and when they came out, they looked severely undercooked. I sent them back and got a grilled ham and cheese and tomato soup instead, which was dripping in grease and butter. I couldn't even eat one half of it without knowing I would have probably have a heart attack. That night, I woke up at 1 am and got extremely sick throwing up. I never throw up!! No drinking was involved. Super weird... I will never go back again."}
{"text":"This breakfast cafe is located at the Westgate casino. Sid's Cafe is actually named after the person who owns Westgate, whose name is Sid. I won't be biased just because of the awesome name of the place, but my experience at Sid's cafe was quite average.  The decor in here is pretty nice. It has a vintage type of vibe to it. This is a nice place to use the backdrop for some photos.   The food provided on the menu is your typical \"diner\" type food. They have breakfast food as well. The portions aren't too small at all. It took a long time for our drinks to be served and it even took even longer for our food to be served. The food and sandwiches are a little big expensive compared to what you get.  If I did not have to wait so long, I would probably give this place a higher rating."}
{"text":"New York Pastrami Sandwich is one of the best I ever had   The flavor is awesome on New York rye bread and melted cheese and Russian dressing"}
{"text":"The service from Francisca was excellent she was so sweet, great food! It has a limited menu but all good was delicious! Francisca was a delightful person, get her as your server, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"With columns, formal furnishings, heavy fabric and numerous chandeliers, the appearance of Sid's can be off-putting.  It's hard to tell if it's a relic of the past, or a relic of fine dining \"from\" the past.  Neither!  Sid's is just a comfortable restaurant that occupies what was once a baccarat room.  Our server Marie was kind, friendly, and absolutely on point.  I always ask servers what they recommend and/or their preference between this and that, and Marie was very helpful. I think it was lunch time (or at least daytime) and I ordered the Reuben (very good :) and my husband ordered the hot pastrami (equally good).  The portions were larger than either of us could finish so we took our leftovers only to realize our room (at the Westgate) had no fridge. That's right. No. Fridge.  Two more bites and then garbage.  If you're staying at the Westgate there are few dining options. Give Sid's a try.  And if you love Reuben's or hot pastrami's, definitely order one!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at Sid's!  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast - Classic and Viva Las Vegas - with excellent service by Frankie.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We came back this time to try other dishes since we stayed at Westgate. When we came for dinner, Hubby ordered a turkey dish that came with gravy. I never liked gravy so when I tried the turkey I had to move the gravy aside. Sorry gravy, you're not worthy! The turkey was not that bad. I had fish tacos. Although the fish was fry (I asked), but it wasn't greasy at all. Tacos was brilliantly prepared. Then we came for breakfast. This time we had the nova with cream cheese and bagel, it's like what we usually eat back home. Now that is something everybody should order if you happen to be here. The price was very reasonable and they served with capers, onions and tomato. It couldn't go wrong with this order. You can make an extra bagel and lox with this one order. Loved that it came with capers too! Lox was very good and cut well. Yahoo! Kick it up a notch!"}
{"text":"I wished I had read the reviews before we went here. Unfortunately, we were a captive audience in the Westgate Hotel and this was one of few options open to eat dinner at the hotel.   After being seated quickly by a very nice hostess, we had high hopes. Unfortunately, it took forever for the waiter to even take our drink order. Hubby ordered the lobster pasta and it was rubbery and overcooked. I had a ribeye which was thin, greasy, and over-cooked (def not the med rare I ordered).  Our waiter didn't come back to the table to check on us for quite some time. My husband had pushed the plate of food away and expected the waiter to come by and ask if everything was ok, but it was a good 30 minutes before he did. I split my steak with my husband while we waited because he was so hungry. Finally, the waiter came and my husband asked for a burger which was ok. But it took a looooong time to get it.    The check took forever to get and once they took payment, it took about 15 minutes to run the card. Overall, we spent 2+ hours in this restaurant, most of the time waiting to be served.   If you have another option for dinner, take it.  Hop on the monorail and go somewhere else - it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok, waaaaay over priced for a cafe. The Westgate doesn't give many reasonable dining options."}
{"text":"I was a guest at Westgate hotel, I had my family come over to meet us for lunch.  My mother, father, disabled sister another sister and myself waited in line for 30 minutes while they continued to seat people behind us with no explanation.  I offered my parents another restaurant  but they decided not to because we were already there and it was really hot out.  My disabled sister had to end up sitting in her walker because she could not longer stand.  Suddenly, a customer who had already been seated said with a loud voice, aren't you going to seat these people they have been standing there for 30 minutes, don't you see them?\"  finally, we were seated.  20 minutes went by and they finally came to take our order and the waiter kept saying \" I can't hear you, what do you WANT! .  So after getting our order taken, my sister was so embarrassed and was just sick to her stomach, so I took her to my room to rest.  I went back to the restaurant to get my parents.   They were eating by the time I got back, I just asked for a dogie bag and threw the food away because I was so pissed off at how we were treated.   The hotel itself was nice and the staff were great, I wish I could say the same about this restaurant but I can not.  There was NO excuse to the way we were treated.  This was an obvious discrimination against disabled patrons for sure."}
{"text":"Got there at opening. Breakfast was avg but solid. Service excellent. Extra star for the service from Paul."}
{"text":"2nd time here this week for dinner.   Thought maybe the first time was just an off night, and it's the casinos only option for late night dining.  Staff here is EXTREMELY SLOW!!!   Don't expect to see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after being seated, and don't expect a refill of your beverage. No matter how busy they are no one moves faster than a snails pace."}
{"text":"The food is good. The restaurant is poorly managed. It takes former we to get a server and when they do come it's like they're doing you a favor.   Problem is the hotel, Westgate Las Vegas, no longer has restaurants open late except for this one and a coffee shop that sells cold sandwiches. Also, room service closes at 10pm. And if you want to order a pizza you're screwed. The hotel doesn't allow pizza deliveries on site because they have a Pizza Hut express that also closes at 10pm.   If you come to Sids expect good food, just very long wait times. The servers have been kind enough to give me 20 minutes uninterrupted before coming to ask for my order. Lol"}
{"text":"Yelp 2017 100 Challenge: 2017 Review 44/100  Sid's cafe is one of the various restaurants in the Las Vegas Westgate hotel. When compared to other restaurants (which provides foods that cost an average of $30+), Sid's Cafe is a little more affordable (ranging from $15-30).   I ordered the Hawaiian chicken sandwich ($15) which tasted good, but would rate that dish as maybe $10-12. However, it is Vegas so the prices will be high.   The reason for the three stars is my waiter did not give me a refill on my drink, and the options on the menu is slightly limited in my opinion."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the only reason this review is getting 2 stars is because of a very few things that they did right that I will explain further in this review.   I am a vegetarian and my husband is not so eating out is usually a compromise or sometimes such as this a necessity. I arrived first since he was finishing checking in for us at the hotel. I was seated and told our server would bring our silverware and drinks shortly. While sitting there I noticed a curled up long onion that had been sitting there, for who knows how long by our salt and pepper shakers. A few minutes later a lady comes by and does take my drink order. No smile, no hello, no, welcome, nothing....just what can I get you to drink? Like I was doing her a dis service by being there!  I reviewed the menu over and over the ONLY vegetarian item on the entire menu including appetizers, salads, and soups was a veggie burger that had a zucchini and  squash topping with some mayo. I didn't want any squash on a burger and I don't eat mayo so, that was not going to work for me. Usually they have other burger options you can just replace the veggie burgers with but, not in this case because, they all had meat factors that couldn't be removed. So, I asked the waitress if I could see a kids menu. I explained that I was a vegetarian and how the only option was the veggie burger. She gave me a dirty look and shook her head, then proceeded to tell me there are no vegetarian options on the kids menu! I know from my experience as a chef that's impossible, so I pressed further. Finally she went to the host stand, fumbled around and found me one. What do you know three options appear!! When my husband arrived and we get ready to place our order we now have a new waiter. I decided I was going to order a grilled cheese off the kids menu and just add tomatoe. (This was a $6.99 dish keep in mind ) . He tells me he's going to charge me the adult portion because I want to add tomatoes and he will just say no ham.  I asked what item is he referring to? \"He said the ham and cheese\".   Now keep in mind they pay .$.39lb  for tomatoes and $5.00 lb sliced ham and he wants to charge me $16.00 for a grilled cheese? He fought with us on this issue for a few minutes then acted like he was doing us a favor by allowing us to have the original price.  Charge me a buck or two more for ordering off the kids menu I don't care, charge me for my tomato, but, to blatantly try to bate and switch me to over charge me so your tip is higher...no way!!!  Now to the food...my husband ordered the French Dip. He said it was good. He would eat it again but, nothing great. Portion size was larger than I expected. My grilled Cheese was so greasy it was dripping while I ate... No it wasn't tomato juice...it was actual oil!! Also, the cheese they used was American and I would I preferred Cheddar but, that was my fault for not asking.  The highlights of this dining experience were the French fries!!! Hands down they tasted just like Arbys fries! If I had a Jamocha shake I would have been set and this rating would have been much higher! Yet on a serious note this place needs menu adjustment for vegetians( who are one of the fastest growing dietary choice) heavy duuty training on staff enthusiasm and customer interaction/ service!"}
{"text":"We were directed to this restaurant when we asked for a place to have appetizers and cocktails by a casino staff member. The \"cocktails\" came out of a can, and appetizers were barely edible. Waiter was nice, but everything else was a  disappointment. Exceeding limited menu. No real drinks. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Shrimp scampi was really, really heavy on cream with no basil or flavoring to speak of. It was like eating a stick of butter for $26. It was gross."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I eat here for free cause they always send me coupons. Poor folk need not apply cause an iced tea will trip ya up at $4... breakfast, lunch, and dinner.. if yo trying to impress yo bottom bitch, throw some dubs on that piece and roll into Sid's."}
{"text":"I think this place has really improved over two years ago.  One of my favorite dishes on my most recent visit (and one I've been craving ever since) was the Roasted Turkey & Gravy meal.  There were large slices of roasted turkey over bread and covered with gravy with a side of mashed potatoes and broccolini.  The broccolini was a little bitter for me, but I couldn't get enough of the turkey, potatoes, gravy and gravy-soaked bread.  It was sooooooo crazy good, and it'll be my first meal when I return!  Also, service was very friendly.  I also had a Caesar Salad that was overpriced for $11 and sized more as an entree than a side salad.  It was very good, but I couldn't order it again as a side.  I barely got through any of it and the rest went to waste unfortunately."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service! Paul and Juana were awesome! Sunday morning breakfast (they don't open until 7:00 a. m.) I Juana as my server. She got me some desperately needed water asap and took my order. I had the breakfast croissant sandwich. The croissant was way better than expected! I had my eggs over easy on the sandwich and it came bacon and cheese on it as well. The croissant, eggs and breakfast potatoes were great, but the bacon was soft. Crispy bacon is a must.   Monday breakfast I was in a hurry and Paul hooked it up! I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. The bacon needs to be even crisper! Well for my taste  anyway. Okay I digressed, I told Paul I was in a hurry and he said no problem Mr. Preston I'm your guy! I had my pancakes, semi crispy bacon, check (with the $10 taken off from the players club) in about 5 minutes. Paul was awesome.   Okay so 4 stars for the two servers I had. Paul and Juana made this place great. The food was okay for a casino dinner. Not bad but but not great."}
{"text":"The food is way overpriced, they have only two items on the breakfast menu after 11am (what kind of restaurant doesn't serve breakfast around the clock in Vegas?) and it took for ever for us to be seated or even have our order taken. We heard two parties that were near us complain how their server \"disappeared\" and had been waiting an hour for a check!  We ended up leaving and going to the buffet for brunch since that was cheaper and included free champagne."}
{"text":"Where to begin.  Service...had to ask for silverware and napkins even though we were at the table at the entrance which you would THINK they would always keep set and inviting.  Food....ordered fish and chips and sliders.  The fish was rubbery.  How do you do that to fish??  There was no flavor, no flaking and it was chewy and rubbery.  The slider was bun.  I think there was some meat on there, somewhere, but who could taste it for all the bun.  The steak fries that came with each meal were bland, limp and nothing to write home about.  We stopped here for lunch while taking a break from the Mr. Olympia convention and the crowds............won't make that mistake next year and I hope other convention attendees read this review and take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place is at all that bad with 2.5 stars.  I had a good experience at the restaurant.  Wait service was excellent and food came out to be above average.  I especially loved the grilled watermelon with burrata cheese, tomatoes and caviar olive oil and vinegar, a little play on molecular science.    The lobster roll came out to be decent with chunky lobster meats.  Although not all claw meats but rather given the joint meats, I still liked it as it's a little chewy but in a good way.    The Caesar Salad portion is huge and the dressing was spot on as how Caesar dressing should be.    Definitely a 3.5 stars borderline 4 so I gave it a 4 as the wait service was terrific."}
{"text":"Sid's cafe located inside of the Westgate hotel & casino. It was hot outside & late & I was too tired to go anywhere else so staying here at The Westgate we said let's give it a go, so glad I did. If it isn't on the strip or has a famous name people avoid restaurants. Do not do that here, I loved the hotel & turns out I love this cafe. We ordered 2 burgers mine was w/ blue cheese and hers was just a typical American cheeseburger, they were great. Flavors were very good, thick perfectly cooked burgers. Even if your not staying at the Westgate you should eat here for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Worse customer service. The host keeps on rolling her eyes no trace of smile on her face. Then another older lady took us to our seat was also rude. Won't be back to this place again! Shout out to the manager: educate your staff about exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because I needed a quick bite before a convention. Worst decision! After ordering, it took 35 minutes for them to deliver a burger. The restaurant wasn't even packed! I asked to speak to the manager. She came over and just looked and said oh are you done? No, hello, no hi I am. (So still do not know her name)... Nothing. I said no, I am not done, it took over 35 minutes for me to receive the burger, is it normally this long of a wait? She said no. No apology, just \"I'll take something off\". I get the check and all she did was discount a $25 check by $6.25. (That barely covered my $4 soda drink). I will not be back. The lack of professionalism was appalling. Avoid this restaurant! The burger wasn't that good either, I'd rather had Five Guys.  At least the waitress was apologetic and friendly."}
{"text":"If you've got somewhere to be, this is not where you have breakfast in Westgate.  It will take 30 minutes to get your drink order.  So, be ready to order drinks and food when the waiters and waitresses get to you the first time.  Otherwise, you'll be there for 90 minutes before you eat.  That might happen anyway but, at least it ups your odds.  Hit the buffet instead.  I'm pretty sure the food comes from the same kitchen."}
{"text":"3 stars for middle of the road food. I ate here 4 times over  the course of a convention as it was convenient and in the hotel close to the convention center. I had several great servers and they did a good job.   The ham and cheese was decent. The oatmeal very middle of the road. Probably the best thing I had was just a 2 egg breakfast, hard to screw that up!"}
{"text":"This is the sort of cafe that serves a little of everything. While staying in the hotel, my friends and I decided to have dinner. I ordered the lobster roll. When I asked if there was mayonnaise in the lobster instead of butter, I got a no. However when I got the roll guess what made with, mayonnaise ! The server overheard me tell my friends and became a little offended. So that was really AWKward. Aside from that, it's like a one size fits all kind of restaurant in this hotel. I definitely think anyone can find something they like here."}
{"text":"I have to say food  is good, but the cafe  is under staff, it seems that the servers have too many tables, we have to wait too long for our food and coffee was never refilled I have to go to the front and ask for more coffee. It is a big restaurante please get more servers for your pick hours."}
{"text":"5 stars for how the restaurant looks. It is elegant and clean and looks like an upscale dining establishment. 2 stars for the service. We were seated and brought drinks right away. It took almost 15 minutes for our waitress to show up. There were only 3 other tables that had guests at them. We kept noticing the waitresses gathering in the back by the register, just standing around talking, and not paying attention. Once our waitress did show up, I order the Chicken and toasted Almond Salad Sandwich. She said \"what\" and I had to repeat myself 2 more times before finally showing her the menu. Her response was \" well, I've been out for a few days, I guess they changed the menu.\" Once we ordered, it took about 25 minutes for our food to arrive. Food was great! We noticed again that all the waitresses were standing in the back talking amongst themselves. A lady who I believe was bussing tables noticed we were out of drinks and got the refills for  us. She came by again a few minutes later and we asked her for the check since we had not seen our waitress. It took another 15 minutes for our waitress to show up with the bill. Spent a little over an hour here total. Food- 5 stars, ambiance 5-stars, service- 0 stars."}
{"text":"Ate dinner last night. My daughter had fettuccine and I had the philly sandwich.  We also had the fried zucchini appetizer.  The food was very good.  The portions are huge!  We could have easily split the pasta between the two of us.  My sandwich was giant. We ate until stuffed and felt bad wasting so much food.  You won't leave here hungry.  The staff was very nice.  There was no wait.   We got seated right away. We will go back and eat there again during this trip."}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast with family.  Tried the Apple Fritter pancakes.  Very good.  A bit expensive for the food portions.  Ask for Frankie if you go."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is decent, but not nearly worth the prices. The biggest reason for the 1 Star is the service.  It was over an hour from the time we ordered until we received our food. We had to give our check of a protein bar to hold her over because it was taking so long. And when it got close to the 1 hour mark we asked if we could at least get bread or something for the kids and they brought some out after another 10 minutes.  My wife's salmon was under cooked and the steak I ordered medium rare was very well done.  This place definitely needs new management!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The most bland, tasteless food ever made in America! The lemonade was the best thing that I tasted, and I'm pretty sure the water had more flavor than the tortilla soup, steak, mashed potatoes, and broccoli combined! I think no one here has taste buds. I even attempted to salt and pepper my own food but it wasn't enough. We spent $80 on disappointment. I bet if I licked my napkin, I would've tasted more flavor. My neighbor who was an elderly gentlemen even complained of his turkey being dry. They tried to \"bring him more gravy\" but of course that didn't suffice. Bring your own seasoning if you want flavor. Either that or just pour the lemonade on everything. Definitely will not ever return to this place, and probably will turn people away that I see heading there if I'm in the Westgate again. This place is horrible, but the service was nice. Avoid by any means necessary! Go elsewhere, you'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Just no, find somewhere else to eat. Service was incredibly slow, waitress seemed like she did not want to be there. Fries were the only thing that was good. Burger was meh and buffalo chicken lollipops were cold, chewy, and feathered. Too expensive for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast because I had a meeting in the hotel and there were no other options.  The staff were friendly and polite. The food was good. But as is typical in a high end Vegas hotel be prepared to be overcharged for everything.  Two of us had breakfast. I had pancakes and she had a omelet. We each had a drink. It came to $50."}
{"text":"I usually write a long detailed review, but Sids Cafe did not appeal to me at all. I ordered the Salmon and it was a bit over cooked. Also I tasted the shrimp cocktail and it was a little rubbery. I was disappointed because all the restaurants I had been to so far in Las Vegas had been great. The waiter was very nice and quick, and the kids meals were very large portions.   If you want a quick burger, then yes, Sids Cafe is the place to go. Just don't order anything else."}
{"text":"While in town for the Nightclub and Bar convention we decided to walk over and have a quick lunch....well, we got seated and then one of the servers took our drink order and we waited and waited...then another server came over and took our food order. I had the burger and my boyfriend had the turkey burger. The table next to us with about 6 people came in after us but yet got their water first (we were still waiting for about 15/20 minutes for our water so they actually gave us two of theirs)! We all got to laughing at this point. Our food finally came out after about 45/50 minutes of waiting. We never got water refills either. We then couldn't find our server to get our check. The table who shared their water still hadn't gotten their food and it was over an hour. This place was not busy either so I am not sure why the kitchen was sooooo slow! Once our food did arrive my burger was ok but dry. The turkey burger was ok to. After we finally did flag down our server and get the check the poor group next to us finally got their food but no ketchup and mustard so we shared ours with them. I know we will never be back to Sid's Cafe when there are such better options along the strip to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times. 1st time the food was very good. Lobster roll and veggie burger were very good. A little pricy for a café. 2nd time veggie burger lacked in taste and was very mushy and prime rib dip was just about as good as arbys. My wife wanted to get a salad instead of fries for her veggie burger. There was an extra charge as was explained to us but that extra charge was 8$. Mind you it was a tiny bowl of ice berg lettuce. Not sure how that adds all up because the meal salads on the menu weren't much more than 8$. The foods decent the price is horrible. Id rather eat at the sportsbook deli in the same hotel for a quarter of the price with basically the same food."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food came out cold--potatoes.  Asked for green onion in omelet but instead got regular onions.  Toast slathered in butter, room temp, must have been sitting out.  Not a place we'd want to return to."}
{"text":"It is in Westgate so for ease and convenience it's not bad food.   I had the Tuna salad on a croissant and it's made fresh daily.   Prices are on the high side but service was good and there was a good variety for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Service was really slow and the food was mediocre. Even though there was plenty of available seating the hostesses had us wait a few minutes, and then after we were seated it took a good 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order. I think there weren't enough servers."}
{"text":"Took a minute for hostess to realize we were standing there. 20 mins for someone to take our order. Food was ok until I found some form of paper wrapper at the bottom of the mash potatoes. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Our party ate a variety of sandwiches. All were okay, nothing special, although we did comment that the coleslaw was good. On another note, I asked for change here another time because the bill changing machines weren't working properly - 10 $1s - and they took forever about it and looked like they expected a tip for their big effort. Um, really?"}
{"text":"Very good food and service, at Westgate. Our server was Bobbie Jean, from the south. She was so nice, friendly, interactive and a true blessing. We will go back just to see her! We were there to see the Sexy show and just dropped in late for a snack, but ate an entire meal."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, clean and prompt.. Plates come out looking great and all 3 dishes i had here was awesome.  I do feel it's over priced for this hotel....and area.  I can eat at the steak House or Benihanas in the hotel for same price but Steak house always closed and Benihana reservations only available late."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times as I darken the door of the Westgate way too frequently.  The room is fairly comfortable and pleasant; once again, they \"re-modeled\" by pulling out some baccarat tables and throwing in the dining kind, but it serves the purpose.  Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it seems like there's a very small crowd and your waiter is nowhere to be found, but fortunately they give out those thermal carafes of coffee so you probably won't need them hanging around anyway.  The menu has evolved somewhat over time (by that I mean they periodically take stuff off and raise prices on the rest), but the food is actually pretty good. We especially enjoy the Sunday brunch menu, which features a very good Eggs Benedict with potatoes that are consistently well cooked, a sweet apple pancake with bacon and eggs, and toast made with thick sliced bread like Grandma had.  Main problem is that it's a typically overpriced hotel coffee shop: there are no bargains here but if you're resigned to that, you can have an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch, 3-4 hours later my friend got major food poisoning, service is terrible, and prices are high. NOT WORTH ANYTHING. Do not order any of the fish or shell fish, you will put yourself at risk and ruin your vacation!"}
{"text":"It's the only burger restaurant in the hostel. It's really very convenient to eat there.  I've eaten more than three times. And the taste is good,and enough to make me full always.  But the waitress is not enough,yesterday we have waited more than 30 mins .....make me crazy.  And expensive, 20 dollars a burger or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great experience! Would definitely go back! Amazing service, waitress was really nice. And the food wait wasn't long at all. I got the French dip, the au ju and sandwich was a 10 out of 10! My husband had the lobster roll and he loved it! They even added a lemon to the ginger ale, a great twist lol. I loved everything about his place. Thank you Westgate Hotel!"}
{"text":"YOUCH!!  We have gone here for breakfast/lunch every year during the SEMA show. it has always been like a standard casino buffet/ cafe.  Well this year they moved the entrance in to the casino and made it look very high end.  I took a couple of my good dealers here for lunch, we waited in line for a few and then they took us right thru the cool new area to the old seating area in the back which had not been renovated. my dealer said \" hey we just got walked thru first class to coach\" and boy did they ever! The waitress barely spoke English got our drinks told us the lunch specials  I got the lunch prime rib it came with an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes and broccolette  my dealer got the meat loaf with the same sides as I had. and my final com padre got a sandwich with fries  now the fun begins......  My plate was cold, old and stiff the broccolette was fresh out of the freezer, the spuds had that surface crust they get from sitting out and the meat was glazed over. the au jus cup was filthy and barely had any fluid in it like a coffee cup in a New York diner.  The meatloaf had cold gravy, and same stale sides as mine,  The sandwich look poor too, his fries if even cooked, were definitely cold.  .......now I'm embarrassed.  I got up and went to the waitress station asked her for the manager she looked left behind the wall that blocks the view into the kitchen were he obviously was standing, and said she would send him right over.  As I turned around to walk back to the table he came out the other side were I caught him.   I asked him are you the manager? He said yes sir.  At that point I literally told him \"come with me\" he followed me to the table and figuring he wouldn't put his hand on my plate so I picked up the broccolette and handed it to him. He was also mortified when I poked the potato play dough and it didn't even make a mark in it.  I told him I'm not paying for this, I brought my dealers here for a nice meal and not to be embarrassed. At this point he offered to bring us new plates at no charge, two of us took him up on the offer the other choked down the sandwich and left the fries for dead. the replacement food was fresh but the whole experience was ruined  The manager did his job cudos to him for that. the one star is for that and that alone"}
{"text":"It's Wednesday evening and Sid's wasn't very busy.  I stopped by and was promptly seated and greeted by my waiter Scott.  The menu is simple, which I like.  I ordered a side salad and the New York steak with potatos.  The steak was tender and juicy and the mashed potatos were good.  I would probably fore go the gravy next time.  Yes it has Las Vegas prices but all-in-all, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Thank you Kathleen, for making my morning brighter! Your service and smile were impeccable."}
{"text":"Service was not great. Waiter dropped off food and disappeared. Had to get up and stop the servers around us to see if we can get more water since no one was checking on us. My food was so-so. Had the Steak and eggs. Steak and sourdough bread were good the eggs and potatoes were not. My friends food was ok they have the hot turkey plate. Would not go back. Some other waiters looked helpful, we just didn't luck out with a good waiter."}
{"text":"Pretty good for breakfast had the three egg combo! Yukon golds were great bacon could have been a little thicker. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Elegant is the first word that comes to mind...  When we arrived before our check in time, we didn't have too many choices to go eat. At 7:30 a.m. Sids Cafe was not too busy yet. I was not that hungry though, so I needed something small... and while waiting to order, we noticed their breakfast portions were huge!  So, haha, we ended up ordering bagels. The bagels were $3 each and it came with cream cheese. They were plain bagels and nicely toasted. Our wait service was not too good. He delivered our bagels, dropped off the check and never came back. We waited more than 10 minutes with our payment card sticking out of the book... and not one person working, of all the workers that passed by, could help us out. We watched a line build up as people were waiting to get in.  They stared at us as we just sat there with empty plates. We started feeling bad, but what can we do? After another 5 minutes, we just left cash to the next dollar and left.   Our next visit was much more pleasant. Frani was wonderful. Since we knew the portions were huge, we shared a 3 egg omlet, which came with potatoes and 4 slices of toast. We also ordered a bagel. This time, we got a bagel with everything on it. Now, I know we got a choice of bagel. It was never offered. My husband hates onion, but settled because I liked it :-) The omlet was great and the potatoes were the golden Yukon potatoes... they were very tender, delicious. Toast tasted like toast, but Frani would come back and check up on us. Much better service than before... except we ran out of coffee. Had to flag someone down. We requested cream & sugar. The coffee came within a few min, but the cream & sugar, I guess, was another trip. Luckily,  I grabbed some from the table next to us....because, almost 5 minutes after the coffee wad poured, the cream was brought to the table. Then another 5 minutes later, the sugar was brought to the table......??  Breakfast was great, it did take a while, again, to do our payment, so as soon as we saw Frani, we got up and gave her our card for payment."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a surprise!  We had one of the best breakfast ever!  My wife had the 3 egg make your own...scrambled with cheddar, Texas sized sourdough, home fries and cherry smoked bacon.  Now she is not an egg lover...but the eggs were so light, fluffy and bursting with flavor that she cleaned the plate in minutes!  I was able to beg for a taste and let me tell you...the flavor was out of this world!  She even called the head chef over to praise him!  But despite the praises he still would not share his secret!  I ordered the eggs Benedict...which was on an oversized English muffin and very good as well!    The prices were very \"Vegas Strip\" like (i.e. high)...but here is a TIP...if you are staying here at the hotel...\"Go Green\" (no maid service) and the hotel gives you a $10 discount on food at any of their restaurants!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service is super super slow. Once we were given our check we had to ask for them to take our payment as it sat on out table for too long. We also saw another person waiting at the register for quite some time and not even be acknowledged. When they finally took our payment, it took very long for them to even process it. We wanted to leave without paying because it was so long of a wait."}
{"text":"Rude waiter... Took forever to order, prices are stupid high... Service completely sucks... Avoid like the plague... Sadly becuz we like Westgate :-/"}
{"text":"Over the course of the week, we only ate here once and it wasn't worth the price point.  I did enjoy my chicken noodle soup and would go back again just for that.  The hamburger did not taste good and we left feeling like we should have gone somewhere else.   That being said, a lot of convention people ordered take-out without issue--that seemed to be their speciality.  So three stars because I know they have it in them to step it up."}
{"text":"To make it short & sweet, overpriced \"swill\"."}
{"text":"the food was terrible in both quality and taste. the wait time was absolutely ludicrous for what was served. everything was far to overly priced. i do not recommend whatsoever."}
{"text":"I was over at a trade show build at the convention center. On my way to looking for a food truck, I decided to see what I could find in the Westgate. I did not have a lot of time and I did not want to drop a wad of cash. Sid's looked like a good option. As I was deciding what to order, I was looking around and the food looked amazing. I was ted to keep it light so I ordered the Motzo Ball Soup which was filling and a great value at under $8.00.  However, I like eating in a peaceful environment. There were a lot of unhappy diners there constantly craning their necks looking for their servers. The wait time to get your order is was sometimes 15 minutes with another long wait to get the food to the tables. I ordered soup and it took 30 minutes to get to me. I was about to walk when my soup came.  The guy next to me was having a meltdown. He was staved, had low blood sugar and he asked me for my crackers which I gave him. He complained to the hostess and to the manager who apologized but did nothing to make the situation better. At one point the explanation was that all the servers were at the window waiting for their orders, which pretty mush left the floor empty.  Most of the servers are older which is fine. Maybe they have been with Sid's for 20 or 30 years. But they just didn't really seem to care as in they know they have their jobs and so what."}
{"text":"If you are staying at Westgate Resort and want a convenient place to eat, I recommend not eating at Sid's Cafe. We had a party of 8 and the food took longer than 45 mins to come out. No waiter came to service our table until we finished eating. The food is not up to par with the price. The service was extremely slow and other customers also walked away. It's better to take a taxi and eat at a different casino."}
{"text":"I would say the food was delicious, the lady boob'ejean is wonderful and beautiful human being love her"}
{"text":"The waiter was nice at first and the food came out pretty quickly. However the experience quickly turned sour and upsetting when I saw the lack of intention and care staff took to tend to customers just waiting and waiting and waiting. My fiancé and I watched our friends be seated and wait over 15-20 minutes to even have their DRINK order taken. NO ONE went over to attend to them, apologize for the wait, acknowledge them or anything. For a high end resort like Westgate I expected way better quality of service and I'm shocked. Not to mention it took quite a while for our waiter to even come over to grab our payment for the meal. Will NOT be dining with Sid's Cafe again, if I can help it. You guys need to retrain your staff, or at least try and game plan for when you have a rush hour to better allocate servers to tables so you don't leave customers waiting. That's how you get reviews like this."}
{"text":"Basic diner food, a little overpriced. I usually get the turkey burger or a sandwich. They are fine. Not sure I would recommend anything more expensive there."}
{"text":"Terrible service,  Quality of Food and so darn expensive,   the wait for Breakfast was over 40 minutes and nobody around to ask for coffee refills,  it was just not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, nice variety to choose from.  Lunch and dinner portions are huge, big enough to split  (which we did) as you do not walk away hungry from this place. It's nice that it is located right in casino area in the former High Roller space."}
{"text":"Friends should not let friends eat here  Without any doubt this is the place no one cares about.  Strange that Sid the owner of Westgate would not taste his food.  I ordered two different main dishes which were the worst examples of turkey dinner and meatloaf that I have experienced.  The turkey was some processed roll that was more salty than free popcorn in a bar.  I did not think that they could mess up ground beef too much, but I was wrong.  The strangely tasting meatloaf was full of chunks of something I could not chew.     Stay away from Sids"}
{"text":"Food was so delish! Had the croque madame and it was phenomenal! The sauce was perfect and rich and creamy  and my cousin's chicken and waffle sandwich was exceptional as well...Crunchy chicken on a bed of lettuce and tomato between two toasty waffle buns, oooh girl! The food was only bested by the service. My word Juana stole the show! Juana has such an elegant demeanor and she is so welcoming and kind! Juana you made our brunch spectacular! I would be remiss if i did not mention Paul who came in as Juana ended her shift and continued the superior service with his excellent smile!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible customer experience ever!   I just wanted chicken noodle soup to go, and the hostess insisted that we be seated and order our soup. I refused and asked take out but she said \"you have to sit and order soup. Then ask it to go\" what a joke I thought? So I asked for a manager, and the manager didn't even come to speak to me but the same hostess came and said \"we will get your chicken noodle soup\". For goodness sake, I was just trying to feed my toddler in our hotel room. I don't know why it was so hard to give me a cup of chicken noodle soup.   Then $10 worth of chicken noodle soup came out and it was in a small foam cup barely any noodle and bunch of celery and broth. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here the cafe is very welcoming with large chairs to lounge in and enjoy a wonderful meal. I was seated across and was able to look out there large windows and opening to the restaurant and watch people. It is very quiet here and peaceful, I was glad for this since I need to rest and get up to date on some things. I was able to do it here in there wonderful surroundings.   I ordered the Spinach and Greens Salad with Tomato Bisque soup. It was a great pairing. The spinach in the salad was fresh and had an abundant amount of feta and fresh strawberries. As I ate the spinach and the strawberry together the cheese made it so flavorful. It could be close to a dessert or maybe in France. The tomato bisque soup was also good it had great consistency unlike most tomato soups that I have ordered, it was not at all watered down either. For dessert since diner was so good I decided to try the carrot cake and I'm glad I did. Again the flavors that they include in the baking are very good and fresh. If you need a place to caught a great hot meal or a light one try here with such beautiful surroundings too!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for late lunch and was greeted by a very nice lady(Geenie ). Our server was polite and gave us the special of the day. I ordered the fried chicken. It was crunchy and delicious. The potatoes weren't mashed but served very chunky. Some may not like the chunks but I didn't mind. The vegetable was a type of broccoli and very fresh. There was a choice of soup or salad . I chose the soup which was the most delicious cream of mushroom soup. My husband ordered the meatloaf special. He said that it was real good."}
{"text":"First time in at Sids. Nice small eatery. Menu selection rather small. I'd probably come back if I stay in  and don't leave hotel. Service was good."}
{"text":"We had no wait to be seated. The servers were excellent and kept our drinks topped off. The food was really good, it was a bit much for me but I'd say that's a good thing. Did take a little too long for our food to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because for me I need above and beyond for 5 stars. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sid's became my \"go-to\" place to eat while at a conference at the Westgate. My first night's experience was a little iffy, as the meal wasn't up to par (except the mashed potatoes and gravy were AWESOME!).   You ask why the 5 Stars then? When I mentioned my concerns over the meal to the waitress, she listened with apparent understanding and left the table. When she returned, she brought news that Sid's had made it right! And they did! they made it 100% right!  As I was there for 4 days, I returned frequently to Sid's - experienced a couple of breakfasts - excellent Eggs Benedict and also really enjoyed the standard two egg breakfast. Further their omelets are awesome!  A salad at lunch was awesome! As another contributor here mentioned, portions are totally large enough to share!   The wait and kitchen staff have no problem at all accommodating special requests ( I practically remade my salad - take this off, please and put this on please). Of course, there was an up-charge for a few things, but it was all fair. AND they always got everything right to order!  Service was superb and exceptionally friendly. A special thank you to Miss Frankie! One special waitress! Come to Fresno, Frankie, we'd all love to have you as a waitress here!  Thanks, Sid's Cafe, for a pleasant dining experience at the Westgate, Las Vegas.  Oh, one more comment - Sid's Cafe borders on fine dining while eating upscale meals at slightly over diner prices. Great experience for the $$!!"}
{"text":"Nice resto decorated with taste, staff is average. Greasy dishes, all their egg breakfasts have 3 eggs! Not sure why 3 & not 2. Overall experience wise it's poor"}
{"text":"Wasted $40. Burger was not good at all. They charged for every topping. Slow and bad service. First review. So sad. I had family in town."}
{"text":"The food is good and the $10 bottomless mimosas are delicious. But honestly, we'd come back just for our server Demario! He was amazing and such a nice guy. Fantastic job Demario!!!"}
{"text":"We had Eggs and coffee, under staffed but our sever Kathleen was a dream!  I hope they can find more staff for peak seasons, especially during Conventions!"}
{"text":"The service is fine, but the hotel has some stupid rules about ABSOLUTELY NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  I'm diabetic so I can't eat all the hash browns or country potatoes, so I usually substitute the potatoes for cottage cheese. No such luck here.  So if your diabetic or have any diet restrictions, avoid this place"}
{"text":"Great little cafe type restaurant! We had 3 meals here! Frankie was an excellent server! Brunch on Saturday with bottomless mimosas was the best!!!! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I only came here before a race because it was easy and cheaper than other options in the hotel.  I ordered the turkey burger.  The bun was supermarket quality.  The patty was dry.  No mayo was offered.  The ketchup bottle on the table was empty.  The fruit wasn't fresh.  I don't have anything positive to say about the food.  Not one thing.  The waiter was friendly though.  So I give him props.  The food took maybe 15 minutes to come out, so it's not as if  we were waiting forever.  But I wouldn't go back unless I had no other choice."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a morning meeting and breakfast! Kathleen was our server and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok food for high prices ($10 for half a grapefruit, $22 for a 2 eggs and 3 silver dollar pancakes and sausage)  with very poor service (especially for those prices).  Horrible attitude from our waiter Scott. My husband and I literally were questioning if we possibly did something wrong to deserve the major shade we got from this waiter. The service made us uncomfortable and made our dining experience very poor. Some examples of said poor service/attitude:  A: When we sat down, my husband asked to close the check immediately after ordering since he had to leave early, to which he responded with a snide \"well, i have to put it in first\" and refused to take my husband's offered CC.   B: Asked for 2% milk for coffee, received a cup of milk and was charged $5. When I politely asked Scott the server about the fee, he literally rolled his eyes and grabbed the receipt. When he came back he simply placed the receipt in front of me without a word.  I honestly can't complain about the food, nor speed of food delivery, but I will not be back due to our experience. I am hoping that this was a \"one off,\" but management should work on hiring staff that can offer a consistently pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Got take out to bring up to the room. Ordered something simple to be safe because it was late. Food was horrible-chicken lollipops which were described as similar to a chicken finger-were disgusting & not at all similar. Gave an extra star because the waiter who took our order was nice."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time and money eating here. Way over priced for an ice cold, dry french dip sandwich and a cesar salad drenched in dressing that was served as WHOLE PIECES OF LETTUCE...do they not even have time to chop the lettuce up?! I would not even eat this food if somebody paid me. Not only was the food disgusting, the wait was RIDICULOUS. We waited over 15 minutes to order and the food didn't come out until 45 minutes later! On top of that, we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the cesar salad...why was the cesar salad the last thing to be served?? You'd probably be better off walking over to the Pizza Hut..."}
{"text":"Worst service. No water refills until after I got the check. Slow slow slow. Food was not even all that and pretty expensive for what's you're getting. Do not come, you'll regret it."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place straight up is lackluster. With the other options you have in Vegas it makes this place seem really extra poor."}
{"text":"This place is gross! Bad service and bad food. $14 for the worst tuna sandwich I ever had. It was more mayonnaise and tuna. They should pay us to eat here."}
{"text":"I patronize Sid's every year when I'm at ICSC RECon. They have a good menu and it's quick service for Las Vegas Convention Center people.  This year Frankie was our server and she was friendly, attentive and efficient.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I recently stopped here for lunch while the MAGIC trade show was in town. It's a nice breath of fresh air from the typical convention center food and is basically attached to the convention center by the skywalk.   If this review was for service alone I'd rate it much higher since our waitress was so friendly and attentive, but the food quality just wasn't entirely there for me. I had the Ruben sandwich which was a huge portion, but for the price I just don't think it was worth it. The bread was a bit soggy and the dressing to meat ratio was way off.  Overall I'd probably come back again during trade show season and would love to see some refreshed menu items."}
{"text":"Great Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles. 4 pieces of Chicken drizzled in spicy Honey not Nuggets but large portions of Chicken. Service was inviting waiters were knowledgable of the menu and spot on promptness."}
{"text":"Umm I was at lost at the service. This review is mainly service review. We had a party of 3 and our waitress was really nice and friendly, but slow..very slow. Once she put our orders in and came back with our food, we never saw her again. When we tried to ask the other servers around for assistance like refill, box, check....they literally look at you and look away!! I was shocked! I mean there's 2 people who stands around to check if people need service and the others are waiting/cleaning tables...the 2 people who are supposed to look out for customers looked straight past us as if they don't see us waiving our hands. What's worse is the waitress cleaning the table behind us would look at me straight in the eye which makes me think \"okay she saw me, she'll come over\" but she walks away again only to come back and clean the same table for the 3rd time?!! I mean okay if we're not your table and you don't service us fine, but at least acknowledge us and let us know you'll get our waitress like any normal restaurant would?! Seriously so annoyed by that kind of service.   The food itself was decent..mediocre at best. Their menu selection is limited but the food isn't as expensive as other hotel restaurants I guess, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Thanks Scott for being an entertaining and fun server... definitely coming back... thanks again"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Better than expected. Not. Destination location, but if u are at Westgate it's really good! Best turkey club I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a conference.  The conference was held at the Westgate and the Convention Center.   One would think that the hotel would be equipped to handle conferences.  Not this day.  My group of 6 went for an early lunch.   We recognize that seating a large group is hard, so we even suggested that they could break us up.   They assured us that they'd find us a table.     When seated, our waitress came and took our orders and we never saw her again.   Twilight Zone?  Alien abduction?   She went ninja on us.      I didn't think there was much variety on the menu, which kinda surprised me.   I opted for a basic burger.   It wasn't even basic.   My burger patty was cardboard and had no flavor.   None.  Not even salt.  I tried dressing it up with condiments.   Nothing.  I gave up.  I didn't eat half of it.   The cole slaw had pineapple in it.  They should really warn a brother if they are gonna do that.     Since our waitress was MIA, my water and iced tea glass were empty.     Dropping 20 bucks on an inedible burger and sweet cole slaw was not worth it.   (If I weren't getting reimbursed, I would have made a fuss.)  The only redeeming thing was our waitress agreeing to do separate checks, since we were turning in our receipts for reimbursement."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I kept my expectations in check... and honestly the lobster roll is dank af. Chelada is just the bud can served with a glass and food took a minute but damn was it delicious! Staff is great! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We noticed the $10 bottomless mimosas on an ad in the casino so we decided to try it Saturday morning. What a mistake. We were seated and after about 15 minutes our magician waitress Stephanie appeared. I call her a magician because she does a great disappearing act, she really missed her calling. Houdini....err, Stephanie took our orders, 1 french toast, 1 eggs benedict, and two bottemless mimosas. After another 15-20 minutes the food arrived, the waiterss then said she would bring the mimosas. Now, normally I would have said something after 5 miutes and no mimosas but I was trying to be nice. The wife said the french toast was ok, my eggs benedict were cooked properly, which was the only good sign, but the hollandaise sauce was bland. The real problem was the service. After the first mimosas, were empty for about 15 minutes, we managed to flag down another waitress who brought us two more drinks. After sitting empty for about 20 minutes I saw Houdini trying to sneak by and got her attention. I told her to bring 4 mimosas, two each because it was taking her too long. She brought them after about 10 minutes. At this point, a man was being arrested at the hostess stand. His waitress was was yelling at him, then the police cuffed him and took him away. I think he got tired of waiting for his bill and tried to leave. We drank our last mimosas and sat and waited so long for the check, I had to ask an attendant for it. We wanted more mimosas but were not into to waiting hours for a few drinks. I think it was combination of bad service and the game they play to limit the amout of \"bottomless\" mimosas they serve."}
{"text":"Slowwwwwwwwww service. I mean 15 minutes til someone even came and asked what we wanted to drink. We had to ask for our waiter twice before he even came. We ordered dessert only and it was over an hour we were there even with us telling them we were in a rush. Took us over 20 minutes to even get to pay. The only reason they got two stars is because the desserts were good."}
{"text":"The first night, I had a grilled cheese that was so good I almost ordered another...The next morning though I threw up off of the same damn sandwich. The bread was soggy and cheese not melted completely.  Think of government cheese because that is what it was. That thick processed stuff.  How they managed that was really an unknown.  The worst meal in Vegas. It seriously clouded my experience. Once you start vomiting in the casino bathroom, there really is no turning back.  I started to question the experience from the night before. Thinking the overnight cook was just better than the daytime cook but who the hell has time to stay up until 4 am for decent food? I am getting nauseous all over again just thinking about it. Just head downtown to Fremont St.  Great food, cheap prices. Mermaids, near Golden Nugget, has a Nathan's in the back that was fast and cheap and surprisingly good.  I mean really. The steak fries were hot and crisp. The sliders were MICROWAVED and I actually enjoyed it waaaaaaay more than Sids Cafe. And that my dears is the sad truth of the situation."}
{"text":"Frankie was great! Gave us great tips of the city! Ordered the beef curry and watermelon mimosas! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"When you don't have any other choice.... I was staying at the Westgate Hotel for a convention and didn't rent a car.  During breakfast and lunch time, there really isn't another choice in the area that's within walking distance, except for the buffet at the back of the hotel, which I didn't find out until later.  Pancake was so dense you just want to throw up.  Wedge salad was okay."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place came in for breakfast and while we were finishing our meal i found mold on one of their grapes and i told the server about the issue and he didn't manage to get someone to apologize or of any sort"}
{"text":"The service is literally the worst. No one is here at this restaurant, the waiters outnumber the customers - and I have yet to be asked if I even would like a water. The waitresses and waiters are fighting about who's table is who's. And I'm just sitting here hungry. I have never been to such a disorganized restaurant."}
{"text":"tl;dr: I wouldn't necessarily travel to eat here but if you are already at the Westgate then this is a solid choice breakfast or lunch. True Rating: 3.5  Full: The prior neggy reviews do not appear to be justified.   Sid's, no longer a 24-hour eatery, is clearly aiming for an upscale feel which it (mostly) delivers. Prices are certainly upscale (welcome to Vegas, baby) and the welcome I received upon arrival from hostess Jeanine was very warm and solicitous.  Unfortunately the waitstaff service was slow (Jeanine actually had scramble from the front podium to take my order) but this is likely a case of understaffing.   The food quality was above standard. I came in for lunch and had the \"Black and Blue\" steak sandwich ($15) with curly fries which I recommend. All day breakfast is also a plus."}
{"text":"Our third time at the Westgate Benihana wasn't open until 9 how ridiculous SIDS was our alternative again the place sucks the service sucks we ordered food and it came out wrong the waitress wanted to send it back and get it again they can't get it right the first time they can't get it right the second time don't stay here being pestered by everybody hitting you up for a time share this place sucks don't check in be sure to never check out. This place is a dump!!!!!"}
{"text":"Felons was a very nice server. Food was very good. Expensive, as it's associated w a casino, but otherwise good!"}
{"text":"The food was edible but not very good. For the price and the terrible service, I wouldn't come again.  After a long drive to Vegas with two toddlers, we checked into our room and wanted something to eat. We decided to try out Sids because we couldn't fathom the thought of driving anywhere.  The server, an older man, took one look at our boys, who were coloring and rolled his eyes. I let that slide. We were already there and we were hungry. As I was telling him my drink order, our boys started talking amongst themselves and the server, in a very sarcastic tone, told me twice that he couldn't hear me over the screams. Screams?! I'm not one to let my kids sit in a restaurant and cause a scene. If they had been loud, I would have taken them back to the room and asked for our food to go. But they weren't. The server was just being a diva. Again, I didn't let it bother me.   Thought the meal, I kept catching him roll his eyes and he acted as if we were bothering him when we asked for our check or a drink refill.   The ladies in the table next to us had an even worse experience. After explaining the server explained the menu wrong, one of the ladies received something she specifically had said she didn't want. She wanted hash browns with her breakfast but got skillet potatoes instead. The server proceeded to argue with the ladies that they were the same thing, going so far as saying, \"Potato Potahto Tomato Tomahto!\" Needless to say, the ladies talked to a manager and we didn't see the server after that. Not even to pick up the check and give us change."}
{"text":"We decided to give Sid's Cafe a try for dinner since we were tired, hungry and did not want to leave the hotel. I ordered the turkey dish with the mash potatoes and greens. It was way too salty, my boyfriend loves salt and it was even too much for him. He ordered the New York pastrami Reuben and he was very disappointed. I don't know if they were having an off day or if breakfast is more of their thing but based on my experience I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We arrived, starving... and perked at the sight of chicken and waffles on the menu.   Our first server, Ana, was a kind and prompt server.  My son and I split the entree and it was surprisingly big:  a nice chicken breast, thigh, drumstick and wing came with it.    We went back for the $11 Caesar salad and added a salmon for $7 (about 5 oz) I think it was a generous salad.   The wait times to get food was spotty; but it's a good option for hotel guests.    I'll be back, but not when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"We had chicken sandwich with jerk sauce once and chicken ceaser salad .. both were good !!  Chicken wings were not that good"}
{"text":"I like writing good review. This is not one of those. This place is a joke. Terrible service is how we started out our meal. The waitress was in such a hurry that she had to come back a couple times to understand what I already told her. The restaurant was not that busy. We had a bigger group of people, but we couldn't sit at one table together because they didn't have the staffing for a table that large.... Soooooo they just served the same number of people separately. OK, that's stupid. I understand they want to be able to bring the food out all at once and that's harder to do with a larger table, but for crap sake let us sit together! The food was mediocre and way over priced. The whole experience left me disatisfied with buyers remorse."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and service is good as well. Its my second time visiting this place while I stayed at Westgate. I just dont like my check being brought to me in the middle of me eating and not being asked if I wanted anything else, before printing out my check and bringing it to me."}
{"text":"Had show tickets and looking for a cheaper place to grab dinner beforehand. WOW, the service was soooo slow, and the place was empty. The staff seemed as if they were forced to be there. No one seemed happy. We were a party of three. All we ordered were sandwiches but took forever to bring them out. The sandwiches were ok, tons of bread, less meat. The bun for the hamburger was so thick we had to cut the burger into pieces. The patty was decent, but way thinner than the actual bun. The Turkey Club was smothered with too much mayonnaise as if they were hiding the taste of the turkey. We spent about $70 on 3 sandwiches and 2 soft drinks only. Could have ate at so many other nicer places for that price. Next time we will eat at home before the show."}
{"text":"10:55  am got in line (I was third from the front)  it took 25 minutes to get seated and 10 minutes to meet my server. Parts of restaurant closed due to lack of staff. Ridiculous.  I had a 12:00 appointment across the street and was late and I ordered bowl of soup, a diet coke and my check."}
{"text":"Had special of the day Fish and chips and smoked turkey. Located inside Westgate hotel and casino makes for a vibrant ambience. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"After being seated, the waitress didn't take our order for 30 minutes. The food was ok, the prices were high for a cafe. Never going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sid's, and thought the food was great. The portions are very large, so come hungry. Scott was our server, and he was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as the reviewers say.   We weren't in a hurry so I didn't notice the service but it could have been much worse.  I had the lobster Benedict which was really good with generous amounts of lobster."}
{"text":"I almost didn't eat here because of the reviews and some of the photos but as long as I didn't order any Fruit I thought I'd be ok."}
{"text":"Not what you would expect. Food was dry with no flavor. I ordered a medium rare steak like chewing gum    I would come back."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning.  The omelette was great as was the coffee.  Food arrived quickly and was hot.  Kathleen was a great server.  She made sure we had everything we needed.  We sat in the back room which was less crowded and more private."}
{"text":"I gave this place one star cause that's the lowest option to give, if I can give it a negative rating I WOULD!!!! 1. Service: horrible!!!!  Our server went around the table taking our order and absolutely refused to hear us out about separate checks. He got to us and my wife asked for a mixed drink and he denied her because he didn't like making that specific drink! (REALLY?!!) I asked for an iced tea with lemon! Everyone got drinks but me! When I asked for my drink I got attitude! Then when I asked for refill, TWICE!!, he went on to argue with me that he had already refilled it and that he was busy!!THATS A FORST FOR ME!!   2. Food: the food finally can out 25 minutes later!! Food was BAD! Made me sick!! I asked for a shrimp cocktail and what I got was 5 thawed out parawns with cocktail sauce!! Zucchini chips were absolutely nasty!! No flavor and it came with a huge glop of mayo as dipping sauce! Needles to say I will never eat here again!!   Worst service and food!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line - the food is not good.  It's Vegas so overpriced (which would be okay if the quality matched the price).  Due to our schedules came here twice for convenience only.  Had hot sandwiches (French Dip, Philly Cheesesteak), and Chili... the grease alone still makes me grimace.  The lobster roll was adequate, as was the turkey platter.  Yet the fruit cups had rotten fruit in them.  Really?!  Overall, greasy, tasteless, heavy offerings.  We were mad at ourselves for coming back?!"}
{"text":"We had Frankie and she made our meal so amazing! My mom and I were next door at the convention center for a conference, and stopped her for a quick bite and a break! We both got the club sandwich and it was so yummy! So much food so we both took some home! Prices were fine - it's Vegas, it's a nice hotel - so that wasn't a problem. My advice though - sit near the back of the restaurant, because if the casino gets smoky, it can waft into the front part. Thank you, Frankie! You were great and so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something off the beaten path and wandered into the Westgate for some breakfast.  The atmosphere is fine and I was seated quickly.  ONe look at the menu and I started to think that \"this better be good\"  The prices were at least 15-20 percent higher than other LV casino coffee shops.  I didn't notice anything on the menu that would set them apart from anyone else or something that would make people want go out of their way to visit this eatery.   The waiter was polite, but had the personality of my table.  Hardly spoke anything to me and barely thanked me for dining at this place.  At least now I know where not to go when I am wandering around LV for breakfast."}
{"text":"As a local my expectations are a bit higher as we have choices living here in vegas.... services here is slow at best..... everything is over priced ( Cesar salad and salmon ( 1 inch x 1.5 inch sliver) $19.00..... really?  Trust me go to peppermill for lunch you'll get better service and value!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner four out of the six nights we stayed in Vegas - not because the food was really great, but because the restaurant was in the hotel and we were hungry.  The food is okay - some meals are better than others.  I think my favorite was the French Dip sandwich -- absolutely five stars for that meal. They have salads if you want to go healthy.  The service was a little slow, but they let you know that before you sat down.  Great place to eat if you need a quick bite at the Westgate!"}
{"text":"Was going to eat here for lunch today but the host totally turned me off. She was rude. That alone would make me not come back. Apparently the food is not even worth the hassle judging from the reviews on here."}
{"text":"Gr8 chicken noodle soup, nice Rueben and terrific fried chicken.  Decent service and homey coffee shop.  Love the ice tea.  Large menu selection but could keep breakfast menu open later.  Reasonable for a strip restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this Cafe. It offers the best chicken soup ever. It was light and very clean tasting. Also had the delicious Reuben Sandwich and a wonderful glass of freshly brewed ice tea. On a lesser note, I thought the fries were a bit greasy and the Cole slaw dressing was weak. Over all I will look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 12-12-15 at about 12:30 PM.  I was expecting a dingy ol' casino diner but this place is actually nice-looking.  A glance at the menu board revealed some impressive options like lobster rolls, prime rib, and succulent shrimp cocktails.  Prices were not too bad and the hostess was so down to earth that we decided to throw caution to the wind and dine here despite the 2 star average.   Service was prompt and friendly and I began to wonder why all the bad reviews?  They brought out my baby's fresh fruit first which, to me, is very thoughtful and understanding of the impatient nature of 1.4-year-olds. At this point I figure the place has got a bad wrap from tourists.  An old couple next to us was leaving and asked if we wanted a piece of bacon that they didn't eat.  LOL Waste not, want not, I suppose...but it made me laugh!  Then the food comes.  I was so excited about the matzo ball soup!!  First bite revealed that it is lukewarm (STRIKE 1) and the veggies are so fresh they tasted like they had *just* been chopped up and thrown in the soup.(STRIKE 2) Who likes raw soup?? Not me.  I wanted hot, slow simmered, mushy veggies and hot broth to warm me up on this cold day and I was dissapointed.   The lobster roll was a disaster.  The outside of it was burned (STRIKE 3) and the bread was spongey and stale like it was baked two weeks ago. (STRIKE 4) If this was baseball they woulda been out by now.  I was willing to forgive all that, though, because the pieces of lobster were so big and there were entire claw pieces in it.  Two bites in revealed the lobster to be hard as a rock, fishy, and littered with pieces of shell.  (STRIKE 5) It was impossible to eat, and at $19 I did not feel like I should have to pay for this inedible mess, and the waitress was nice enough to take it off the bill.  I've literally never had to do that before at any restaurant.   Husband's prime rib sandwich was awful...instead of big fluffy pieces of prime rib it was shaved like a philly cheese steak.  You can't pick how you'd like it done and it does not come with cheese so ask for it if you want some.  Curly fries and the fresh fruit were the best part of the meal.  Oh and the piece of bacon that the old couple gave us was good, too.   It's a shame because this place is so cute and the menu items are very enticing but their cooks suck! If I was ever forced to come back here I would get something reaaaalllllly safe like maybe breakfast."}
{"text":"Great attentive wait staff. Good Italian chopped salad, homemade matzo ball soup. Seemed to be good homemade chicken stock.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"All old grumpy people working that go slow and take forever to server you and don't refill your drink The whole time while no one else is around. Very poor services and rude servers. Had a hard time with everyone who worked here and surprisingly we were very sober"}
{"text":"Loved it! Can't believe all the negative reviews, the service was excellent, the food was great! They must've changed the ? ? I'm glad I saw the reviews after I had sat down otherwise I might've missed this place."}
{"text":"Can't believe how good the good was and how much you get! We have eaten there four time and every time the food was soooo good! The staff where all so nice."}
{"text":"Me And Friends Are Staying At The Westgate. Of The Restaurants Here This Was One Of The Lease Expensive Ones. When We Got Here We Stood And Waited To Be Seated While The To Waitresses Stood There Talking. Very Rude! When I Got My Food My Order Was Incorrect And Two Of The Employees Were Upset That They Got Incorrectly! The Food Wasn't Great. Wouldn't Recommend And Wouldn't Come Back!"}
{"text":"The price is a little on the high side. The Ruben sandwich was great, lots of pastrami. The best part was our server Kathleen.  She has such a great personality and sense of humor that I would definitely request her table.  Thanks again Kathleen for being one of the best parts of our trip."}
{"text":"Umm.  Not good, icky over priced food, sounds fancy but just not good...  Stay away, go anywhere else except the buffet which is also rubbish. Fried chicken, burger, meatloaf, one iced tea, two waters, one side salad, $72.  Gross food.  Service is also poor, slow and there are plenty of staff but they keep disappearing and are not attentive.  Water refills were painful to get. Give me the old paradise cafe any day of the week over this crap.  Also, hours are wrong on yelp, it's open until late..."}
