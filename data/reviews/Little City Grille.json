{"text":"After visiting the Hoover Dam, We came to this little restaurant for lunch. Burgers were great and Cole Slaw exceptional. Philly sandwich was very tasteful. Service was good. 

An unusual scenario happened when we left for Las Vegas after dining. I found that  I forgot  my purse and left it in this restaurant.  We called back after we discover this and they said that they had the purse well kept waiting for us to return. We expressed our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the staff there.

We are over-joyed by this lost-and-found experience and will definitely visit this restaurant again  when we will have our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch - burgers were excellent, homemade curly fries are the BEST! The kids enjoyed the books and games for kids. Our waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to have lunch with our 5 kids for lunch after visiting Hoover Damn. This place was absolutely amazing! We love supporting local family owned business, well the Little City Grill is now at the top of our list. The server was the sweetest girl, very helpful with the menu, we had God conversation with her and that goes a long way in our book. Now for the food, with a family of 7 we were able to taste a good portion of the menu and let me tell you EVERYTHING was amazing! All of the food was homemade and absolutely delicious. We will definitely stop in and eat here again if we are in the area. Great service, amazing food and the own/ chef came out and chatted with us and shared the building history with us! How awesome is that?!"}
{"text":"Out in BC for some shopping and decided to grab lunch at Little City Grill. Sure glad we did!  Started with a great choco shake to share, then an appetizer plate - fried pickles, cheese sticks, mushrooms, and zucchini, all seeming fresh made.  Then burgers for lunch, also outstanding. Fairly busy lunch time on Saturday but the service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Worth the drive over from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop going home from Vegas.  Key lime pie is a must have along with mac and cheese chile bread bowl!!!   Great service as well"}
{"text":"Darling restaurant. Charming, eclectic...wonderful atmosphere. The food was fantastic. I had the blackened salmon, and combined with the creamy potatoes and mixed seasonal veggies, the plate was perfect! Great value, delicious food, fun setting!"}
{"text":"The best food in town! Unbelievably good, fresh, tasty food on our way to the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVED this place.  The food was excellent.  More importantly, the service was incredible.  The staff is among the friendliest group of people I've met while traveling.  They were nice and engaging.  Their attitude just made the dining experience that much better.

If you are heading to Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon from Las Vegas, I highly recommend that you stop in for a great meal and a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"The wife and I love this place!  We are fortunate to live in Boulder City that has an abundance of great diners and this one is our breakfast favorite.

Always good food and better service. We don't like big places and the small size of this place is right up our alley. 

Our kind of place. :)"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is outstanding. Large portions of food and well worth the drive from the strip"}
{"text":"Treated well! Great food and service without the high cost. Prime rib Philly Cheese Steak and Wrap...yum!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Stopped here before our 5hr drive home from Hoover Dam. Will definitely stop again next time we're in the area. Friendly, cute, comfortable. Food is awesome! And hot! Bf had bacon cheeseburger. Loved it! I had veggie breakfast burrito (breakfast all day!) with french fries. Crinkle cut fries! Need I say more? ... burrito had fresh veggies and big enough that I got to save half for later. Very reasonably priced for what you get, quality & quantity. Bf says you must visit the restroom, \"it's fun!\" Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I have to start off with the food was amazing. However, you could here everyone talking from the kitchen while we were there... Pretty annoying. Then an older couple came in with a \"service dog\" that was allowed to sit in the restaurant next to us. It was a small very furry and was not even labeled as a service dog. It was allowed to sit on a chair! Even though there was an outside patio and a beautiful day. I don't understand how that works for health codes? All in all, the food was good but I really don't care to eat with other people's fake service animals and listening to the cooks in the kitchen talk about their weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent - Excellent - Excellent - Delicious - Delicious - Delicious!  We were driving through Boulder city heading home to Vegas & stopped in for a late lunch - oh so happy we did! I had the Kobe Beef Burger & my husband hand the basic burger w/LT & Swiss! We WILL BE BACK!  I forgot to take a photo so you'll have to take my word for it - Stop at the Little City Grill as soon as you can! Great service from Jestina & the chef stopped by too! Yummo!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on our way to Hoover Dam. Cute little place with excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat. They had good beers, all four of us are fussy about our beer and there was a good selection of beers, we were all happy. I had Veggie burger, two of us has the fish and chips and one had the Phili -cheese burger. 
Waitress was friendly and made sure we had what we wanted. 
We all will return to eat there again"}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped in after all the great reviews. I was really impressed as soon as I walked in. Greeted with a nice smile and help from the waitress. Super cute place inside, and very clean. I had a burger with the homemade curly fries. Delicious! Big portions. They also made their own ranch and fry sauce. Everything on the menu and what I saw come from the kitchen looked so yummy! Also the 2 ladies working up front were extremely friendly and proffessional, outstanding service.I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Been here a few times and never fails to impress. Highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"We were in town for our son to race at Bootleg Canyon and stayed at the Sands Motel next door.  Our son wanted to carbo load for his next day's race, so we went there because pasta was on the menu.  What a cute place!  The food was really good, although I ordered the \"grilled\" pork chop that was actually battered and fried.  It was really good, but I would not have ordered it if I new it was going to be prepared that way.  The vegetables with it were perfectly cooked.  Great service.  We will go back if we are ever in that area again.  Prices were definitely reasonable for what we got."}
{"text":"I definitely give this 5 stars. Fast, friendly service, and the pork chops and mashed potatoes were as good as what I grew up on in the south. They are not afraid to use spices, and cook with flavor. I might have slapped someone if they tried to take the food off my plate..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab lunch on the way back from the Hoover Dam and found this gem on Yelp.  Good burgers, \"bottomless\" fries, and all-around good diner fare.  I had the Reuben per our waitress Jessie's recommendation and wasn't disappointed.  Go off the well beaten chain restaurant path and try Little City Grille if you're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Visiting the area from East Coast. Looked for a good burger place for lunch. The previous reviews were right, this place is awesome. Service was fast and friendly. Burgers were delicious and although all three types of fries were good, we agreed the curlers were the best. Atmosphere was adorable also."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and won't be going back anytime soon for the following reasons:

1. Our server was cold and short with us from the start. It was like we were an inconvenience to her. 

2. My husband ordered the pork chops. In the menu they are listed as coming with mashed potatoes. They arrived with fried potatoes. When he asked about it we were told \"I don't think they're doing the mashed potatoes anymore.\" 

3. When she brought our food our server asked us if we could pay right then so she could \"count her drawer.\" My husband replied that we'd rather eat first.

The rest of the experience went downhill from there. She brought us the check right after setting our plates down and when we were about halfway through she asked us again if we would pay the bill so she could count her drawer. 

The food is really good and the service has not always been this bad. She hovered around the table until my husband pulled his credit card out. We won't be going back anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Very good food and even better service. Our server was very friendly, we were able to enjoy our meal although we were surprised a place this good wasn't very crowded right before and during dinner. Would definitely recommend going if you pass through."}
{"text":"Unexpected find on the way to Hoover Dam. Delicious breakfast. Interior was quaint and surprisingly upscale. Had the 411 4-meat omelette w home potatoes, and kielbasa breakfast sandwich w grilled onions on sourdough. Great service. Highly recommended. Free refills on iced tea and coffee. 

Total was $25. Worth every penny! Will def eat here again when passing thru."}
{"text":"What a great find! We happened upon this little gem while driving from Vegas to the Grand Canyon with a quick stop at the Hoover Dam. We were starving and looking for a smaller place (not a large chain) for breakfast. This place fit the bill. The chicken fried steak was HEAVENLY! My husband commented that you could cut it with your fork. Being a true southerner, I take great pride in my biscuits and gravy. Good news- so do they! Our plates were scraped clean to get that last bite if gravy- it would be a shame to waste. My toddler and 10 year old both loved their kids classic breakfast- eating every bite. Some people were ordering lunch and everything looked yummy. Even the coffee was good. The service was top notch even when the lunch crowd started to fill up the restaurant. Give it a try- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Such a cozy little restaurant to take a break from a day of traveling! The burgers were superb- and very filling my hubby couldn't finish his. I ordered Mac n cheese for our little one and wished I had gotten it for myself! 

Definitely a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Loved this adorable place.  They had great sandwiches and their fries were good.  Way too many of them, but still good!"}
{"text":"Like a slice of Route 66 nostalgia in your tummy! My family happened upon this gem after an all-day drive through Arizona. Nestled in the quaint downtown Boulder City downtown district, this small, red building houses a fantastic classic dinner, complete with soft-serve ice cream and a jar of peanut butter (for impromptu Elvis classics, perhaps?). My four-year-old loved sitting at the counter and getting her real-cheese macaroni-and-cheese. My husband became giddy when he found out there was house-made \"fry sauce\" to go with his hand-cut fries and blue cheese and bacon burger. I felt joy with every bite of my old-school grilled cheese sandwich made on buttered Texas toast! Americana menu at reasonable prices, made to order with wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, customer service and price. Definitely a must!!
Thanks from Barcelona :)"}
{"text":"This place was much more up our alley than the busy southwest grill down street.  The owner's genuine love for the place is evident in the prompt and attentive service, the fantastic, gourmet food and the lovely warm ambience.  And excellent local brew coffee."}
{"text":"We had hamburgers for lunch at this restaurant. It seems like a family restaurant with some very unique decors. The burgers were very tasty and the fries are very fresh. The service was a bit slow but very friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food and service was exceptional! Special shoutout to our waitress, Amanda and her assistant waitress T.C. and to the Chef for his flavorful hand-breaded zucchini!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp while on our way home from Vegas. The food is great and the people so friendly!! We will definitely be coming back!! Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Made a quick, impromptu lunch stop here on the way back to AZ after a weekend in Vegas, and definitely made a good choice. Just a nice little grill/diner/cafe sitting quietly in the middle of BC just beyond where most of the traffic moves along 93. 

The decor and vibe is genuine, small town roadside, kitschy Americana, without being too intentional or contrived.....something really lacking in our suburban world. The small building probably qualifies as historic, but is in a good state of upkeep and everything appears quite clean, including the classic uni-sex restroom that is accessed from the outside.

The menu is surprisingly extensive for such a \"joint\", and the prices are reasonable. The food and service were both equally enjoyable and we left for the remainder of the 5 hour drive full and happy we stopped. We'll definitely make it a point to visit again the next time through."}
{"text":"Perfect capstone to our Hoover Dam excursion. Fried pickles, Kobe burger and L.A. wrap are worth a try. Quaint setting and great service!!!"}
{"text":"Make it a priority to stop by this Boulder City eatery. Good vibes and a more than friendly staff. I had the foot long hot dog covered in chili and my bro had the classic cheese burger. Both were authentic and delicious. Had not experienced food this good in a long time. Menu is full of delights and I will make it a point to be back and try out the rest of the menu. Wish I lived in BC because you'd find me here on Saturday mornings with biscuits and gravy on my plate. 

Here's the kicker the I unsweetened iced tea was amazing. Haven't had tea that good since Kentucky. You true iced tea drinkers know what I mean."}
{"text":"Cozy and quaint with interesting decor. Fun to look at. Good service but food was average at best and portions were small. Didn't have high expectations and it hit the spot after visiting Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great portions!  Stopped on our way back to Arizona from Vegas. Thanks Yelpers for the posts to help us find this gem."}
{"text":"This place was great! We wanted to stop somewhere small for breakfast/brunch on our way home from Vegas. I pulled off the main highway onto the business loop, and there it was. It doesn't look super amazing from the outside, but the inside is clean, adorable, cozy, and just very lovely. 

We ordered a breakfast burrito (the veggie one) and an omelette, and the portions were large, and everything was super fresh. It was possibly the best breakfast burrito I have ever eaten. The veggies were fresh, the potatoes were perfect, and the main ingredient was not eggs. The service was great, and they even brought us a free sample of their new chicken noodle soup, because it was \"something new they were trying,\" which was also amazingly good. 

They also serve alcohol (not that we had any after vegas) and a huge variety of menu items, from fresh salads and sandwiches to burgers and fries, and amazing breakfasts. I will not miss out on a chance to visit this place when we drive through there again. GO. So much better than any other highway diner you will find. Thank you Little City Grille!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant,  you would almost miss it... DON'T.  Freshly made delicious food and great service. Good sense of humor in the decoration. if I visit the area again, will most definitely go there. Perhaps they can add some more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Relaxing and quaint place to stop after taking the Hoover Dam Tour.  I love supporting local family businesses! Food was great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and quaint little restaurant! Tasty lunch and very inexpensive! Had the Pound Puppy with a side salad for $5 can't beat that! Sweet potato fries are great !
Highly recommend when visiting Hoover Dam"}
{"text":"Seriously if I could give 0 stars I would! My Husband and I have never been treated so poorly and rude at a restaurant ever.
We walk in sat ourselves down and waited for a waitress and finally a waitress  approaches us and mind you the restraunt is empty. Anyways the waitress approaches us and asks my husband what he would like to drink he orders water and sh3 walks off. Not even bothering to ask me if I would like something to drink. Seriously who does that!
My husband orders something to drink for me and she  gives us this retarded look like we are imposing on her. I'm not even exaggerating here people. 
She comes back with my drink order and places it on the table with this demeanor like we're interrupting her from something. 
She's ready for our order my husband and I look at each other confused thinking she's kidding or something because she just handed us the menu. 
We let her know we need a few minutes and she doesn't say anything she just walks off. 
By this time we totally feel like we are intruding, as we are sitting there thinking we are in the twilight zone we hear the cook speaking very loudly and totally rude and super disrespectful to the waitress. Not caring in the least how humiliating he is probably making her feel.
We asked the waitress if we could just pay for the coke she brought out, she poured my husband's water and my drink in a to go cup and charged us for the fountain drink and for the cup she poured the water into. 
We will never ever go back to Little City Grill which really sucks as we live just down the street. 
I don't know what happened to this place because we used to enjoy the food and the service before. We used to eat at this place a few times a week. But not again, nobody deserves to be treated the way we were treated by this establishment. 
The cook has no right to speak to others the ugly way he did. And the cook can't claim he didn't know he had any customers when he spoke so ugly to the waitress because that place is tiny and unless he is def he heard us order our drinks. 
I should add when we let the waitress know we would not be dining there she could of cared less, the cook could have cared less. 
So why is this place even opened for business? They have no idea what customer service means!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after reading the reviews here. We are SO glad we did!  Food was incredible and the service was fabulous!  Chicken pot pie was huge and delicious, so was the burger. Kids loved the fish and chips with house made curly fries. Decor was cute and welcoming. We will definitely stop in again some time!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Hoover Dam and happened on this quaint little restaurant in the business district of Boulder City. My wife ordered the Red, White, and Bleu Chicken Burger (the day's special) & I ordered the Philly Steak Wrap. We both ordered the curly fries. Everything was delicious!!! The bun on the Chicken Burger was a great compliment to the bacon & Bleu cheese. The wrap on my Philly was so light it was like phyllo dough!!! 

The restaurant was quaintly decorated with old photos of the owner's family. Nice touch to make this place like home. The owner said she would add photos of our family if we send them to her. Too bad we live in Florida......"}
{"text":"This was the most amazing find! We were looking for breakfast on the way to the Hoover Dam. We weren't sure we were going to be able to find anything other than fast food. Then we drove by and decided to try it. I had the most amazing French toast I have ever had! The corn flakes add just the right touch. The coffee was really good! The half portion (2 pieces) was more than enough. My son had the biscuits and gravy and it was a huge portion. The biscuit was homemade and he finished the whole thing. My daughter had the hamburger with curly fries and I tried the fries. The were homemade and similarly delicious, She said the burger was great too! All in all, I would make a special trip to this place any time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, service and environment. The hand made curly fries with the fry sauce was awesome!!  We had been to the Hoover Dam in late June and they brought us pitchers of tea and water to quench our thirst. Great young man as a server."}
{"text":"Can't decide which to praise first, the food or the service. Jake was great, despite our constant pestering and demands, he always arrived with a smile on his face. 
For lunch we had hamburgers, salmon and.... hmm can't remember. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 
Make sure to stop by this family ran business. We've been there several times and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Family run grill and cafe. Stopped by after visiting the Grand Canyon. Good casual food, all cooked to order. My friend and I had the fried mushrooms to start. I followed it with a Green Chili Burger with a fried egg on top - sublime. 

Excellent food. Excellent value. Need a nap now."}
{"text":"If you are hungry when passing through Boulder City, eat here! The service was personable and the food was very tasty for our picky palates-enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch. 
Chicken wrap , beef corn hash with perfect toast , veggies and eggs.. 
Must stop by here if visiting Hoover dam. 
Very tasty , flavourful and filling."}
{"text":"The chicken breast, Californian, and the avocado burger were all great. And the price was right with great service."}
{"text":"The food is Fantastic! The service was excellent service. We stopped in hoping for a good breakfast and it exceeded our expectations. I would definitely recommend the french toast!"}
{"text":"Great little place  stopped en route from Hoover Dam back to Vegas. Loved the French toast!  My hubby had the Philly cheesesteak (they didn't have banana peppers which disappointed him) but he enjoyed it just the same. The curly fries were really good!!  Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Loved every thing about it, to the cute decor, the excellent service from Gina, & the FABULOUS food! My husband had the LA Wrap & I had the Club (which has nice thick fresh sourdough) both with the sweet potato fries-YUM. With our meals we had the Black Butte porter and Fish Tale amber beers which were excellent as well. Found this place on Yelp and will definitely be back next time we're in NV!"}
{"text":"Great little gem! Yelped a place to stop on the way to the Hoover Dam & the reviews are right.. This place is awesome. Craft beers, yummy food, cozy atmosphere. Yelp does it again! The staff in here was super fun & welcoming.. We felt right at home. They gave Great Lake Mead advice, too. Just moved to Vegas & we will def be back again!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find. Food was all homemade and the service was fast and friendly. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Cute atmosphere! We had the club sandwich and LA wrap with a cup of beef vegetable soup! My husband said it was the best club sandwich he's had!! The bacon was cooked just right and the turkey was very tasty. My daughter and I shared the wrap and it was awesome! Perfectly combined ingredients without having too much ranch dressing!! 

Would definitely eat here again! I love when the menu has so many things that look good, it's hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Found this quaint place will visiting from California. Great food, great service. My daughter left her favorite beanie behind. Made a phone call and they are shipping it back at no cost to me. They are willing to go the extra mile. The veggie burger is a must have"}
{"text":"I look forward to breakfast here!! My husband and I just love this small town restaurant and the people that run it. If you want a yummy home cooked meal, stop here!!"}
{"text":"Such a great little place!  Good menu and friendly staff. Sweet potato fries were great!  Foot long hot dog was so fat and yummy my friend couldn't finish it. Well worth the stop! The chicken wrap was absolutely full of fresh ingredients and so big I could only eat half."}
{"text":"High expectations, low deliveries. I don't mind waiting for food, but it took a long time, and the food wasn't anything special when it came out. I knocked them down one star for that. Then I knocked them down 2 more stars because of an insult. After being there awhile, my husband ask for our toast to come out early because he wasn't feeling well. Instead of running him out a slice of bread, they waiting almost 5 more minutes before bringing out all of our food because \"it was almost up\". When we cashed out they asked how everything was. I stated, the food was fine but that we didn't get our toast early like we had asked. The cashier said \"oh yeah, your food was almost up. Does your husband have a hangover?\"  WTF?! \"No!\" I snapped. I couldn't believe that she had said that to me. I realize this place gets a lot of traffic coming from Vegas, and probably more then most are hungover party goers but not in this case. Nor should people assume things. Reality is he was hungry when we arrived and during our extremely long wait for food, he got a headache from not eating. What a bitch, not going back."}
{"text":"Great little place. Good food, quick service, pleasant attitudes, and reasonably priced. Hard to beat, will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Found it on yelp and I'm a happy girl right now. The mimosas are amazing (berry mimosas with fresh berries) and the chef wanted to make sure I loved my food....ummm, yes I did and thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast leaving Vegas headed home to Phoenix. Food was awesome, inexpensive and it's just a minute out of the way.  Go there!"}
{"text":"So great food. Homemade. Fantastic service. I will drive to Boulder City just to eat here from North Las Vegas. One oddly good thing. I've never had such great fresh food so fast. Not complaining mind you. More mesmerized. Don't know how they do it so good and that fast! I think the bar had been raised for me. However no pressure either I would happily sit a half hour for that quality. Oh and the malts a great sipping dessert for the ride home FYI."}
{"text":"Came through town for lunch, got the fried egg burger and BBQ chicken salad. Egg was over cooked on the burger and the salad was mostly lettuce and ranch - hardly any beans, corn, chicken, or BBQ sauce. Also had terrible service. The waitress kept forgetting us!  Maybe we just had an off experience because the woman behind me said her veggie burger was really good (but that was after she had to send it back to get the correct cheese and she'd asked for no bun)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and they have always had amazing food that is very consistent as I have ordered a few items over. The staff is always nice and helpful. I highly recommend coming in here."}
{"text":"Cozy - friendly and engaging breakfast hangout. You can spend the time waiting for breakfast reading the numerous funny placards.  I judge a place by if they have REAL OATMEAL....yes! Sweet staff."}
{"text":"Excellent services best burgers in Boulder City staff well spoken and very attentive, the place is clean and very friendly environment. Two types of French fries. Delicious Key Lime pie. Good pricing definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Maybe we came here on an off day but I was not at all impressed here. First it took about 5 minutes after we were seated to even get a menu. After we ordered it took almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive during which time NO ONE talked to us. Just as we were contemplating leaving the food finally arrived. I had the kielbasa burger which was a greasy falling apart mess. The flavors were good but it was difficult to eat. I had sweet potato fries and those were good. My husband had a hot dog. He said it was okay. His curly fries were only curly in name and were sad limp noodles of potato. My son had mac and cheese which he ate so I assume that was fine. The bill came and this place that says drinks are included with combos charged me for ice tea. Was it fancy ice tea? It certainly didn't taste that way. I think we'll go elsewhere next time we're in Boulder."}
{"text":"This place has the best home style food and great service. Really like home here.. I recommend if you want to relax and be yourself and eat some amazing food to check this place out.."}
{"text":"The ambiance is vantage, with a local warmth. Mom and daughter make a great team --customer service in abundance. I had the LA wrap with sweet fries; delicious. This is definitely a place to visit on your travels."}
{"text":"AMAZING home made food and darling ambiance...Randi gave us the best service!
They serve breakfast all day and provide daily lunch specials--everything we tried was unbelievably good!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for lunch after a trip to Hoover Dam. Saw this little spot on Yelp and figured I'd give it a try. Amazing service. Friendly. Felt like home. Food was awesome. Had their Kobe Burger and sweet potato fries. They were both so good. The fries were hot and greasy. The burger was so tasted and messy and wonderful. Will definitely find a reason to come back again."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my wife and son today for lunch and left very satisfied with the experience. The service was great, and the manager checked with us several times to make sure everything was good as well. We ordered the 5 alarm cheeseburger, Philly wrap, kids hotdog, fried pickles, and clam strips, and were happy with it all, plus only paid $39 for everything including drinks. We'll be bringing some family out to hoover dam when they come visit, and will for sure stop in again. Just an fyi, it's a small restaurant and I can see how they could fill up very fast so be aware, although they do have outside dining available."}
{"text":"Unexpected gem.  Lovely place inside, very friendly staff.  We ordered the Kobe burger with curly fries that we split. Patty didn't have any seasoning but the bun was wonderful. Great family place. We will be back next time we're in Nevada."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on our way to Hoover Dam. The menu has a great selection with extremely reasonable prices. The service was wonderful. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Ordered fried pickles to start. Delicious. Biggest fried pickles I've ever had. For our entrees I had the Club with a side salad. Perfectly toasted bread. Husband had the hot dog with chili and cheese. It was delicious. The chili is incredible. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food ... But took over 45 mins to get it. Also. Didn't love when the waitress went to get me some more water and grabbed the top of my cup and her fingers inside the rim.  Same thing happen when she took the two iced tea glasses at our table back to kitchen area to refill and switched the two glasses between two guests !! Not cool."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on our drive to Hoover Dam.  Amazing food.  Amazing service. Amazing staff. 
Excellent menu. Excellent prices."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Grand Canyon West and had a delicious breakfast.  The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great.  All 8 in our party enjoyed the meal.  The Polish Kielbasa sandwich hit the spot.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service and food are equally amazing at little city grille! Our party ordered a mushroom and Swiss burger, kielbasa burger, hot dog and Mac n Cheese, chicken noodle soup, and a steak dinner. All of which were amazing! The burgers were juicy and the hot dog was made with great quality meat.

While the food was amazing it was the service that we would come back for. The chef/owner was super friendly and we could tell he truly wanted us to enjoy or food and our visit to the area which is so hard to find in a restaurant these days. 

If you're in the Boulder City/Hoover Dam area and want to eat good homemade food and talk to a genuinely nice guy you should go to the Little City Grille."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place to eat in Boulder City...only time it was good was when it was the Southwest Diner that moved down the street. My wife and I decided to give it a try because they had handed out but one get one free during the annual Christmas parade...must be hurting for customers. Now we know why.We both had the fish and chip plate. Totally gross undercooked fish. Mushy and actually wet from being uncooked. Fries were cold and limp from not being fresh.We said nothing just paid and left.We will never be back even if they have the food for free...Stay clear of this terrible place....."}
{"text":"We checked out this place from the Yelp reviews. My parents were hesitant (they are old school and just wanted fast food). We told them \"NO WAY! Let's try this place.\" 

After we got our food, they couldn't quit ranting about how good the burgers were! Hand-pressed, fresh, great toppings, ranch and fry sauce brought to the table without asking, bottomless fries, great customer service AND reasonably priced! WIN/WIN! 

Visit this place after you visit the dam!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! When we walked in we were greeted promptly and said we could sit anywhere we'd like. The place was nicely decorated with different pictures and articles from the past. It was kinda dark inside but, it was very relaxing and quiet. There were also card games and books for children.We each ordered a diffedent burger and fries and shared. All three burgers were super juicy and flavorful. Each burger also had very different flavors that were each delicious. The waitress was very attentive and sweet. We ordered 3 different kinds of fries shoestring,crinkle and sweet potatoe. The sweet potatoe fries were my favorite because they weren't soggy like you usually get.I would recommend this place for anyone looking for some yummy food in boulder city."}
{"text":"Awesome! I had the half pound kobe with mushrooms bacon and fried egg with side of cole slaw. My wife had a slaw burger with onion rings. Everything was perfect. Incredible buns. Very impressive. Fun old small town atmosphere. Will definitely return and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch with my fam after a kayak trip on the Colorado River. We were all starved and chose this place based on previous Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint! The reuben, 9-5 burger, Philly cheese steak and SWEET POTATO FRIES were all especially delicious. Fun, relaxed atmosphere with great decor, wonderful service, and reasonable prices. Also, the chef came by to check on us and chat, which was lovely. We are thinking of coming back for breakfast even though we are staying in Las Vegas.... ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food! The fries are the best and so is the Mac and cheese! Cutest little cafe in Boulder City, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience and awesome food. We called ahead for a party of 9.. obviously we had plenty of children to likely drive the others away.  However,  they were very accommodating and gracious. 

The food was exceptional. .. fried pickles .. breakfast items,  lunch and dinner. . Anything all the time. 

Definitely doing this again. . Likely with just a smaller group to be fair.  :)"}
{"text":"Would not recommend Little City Grill in Boulder City.  I thought service was poor, food was average, and saw a  cockroach crawling across the floor !! I prefer The Coffee Cup or Boulder Dame Hotel."}
{"text":"This is a really great little restaurant.   It's run by a friendly and attentive staff.  The decor features eclectic memorabilia from the local area and the food is generous with portions and pretty tasty.  I'd recommend this place for people traveling through to Lake Mead National Park or Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"This used to be called Star Burger but that's all that changed. Still great food, service and prices. Usually stop in to eat here when I am visiting Kinsley Ornamental Iron. My favorite burger I have been getting is the Red, White and Bleu. The Egg Burger is another great one. Their crinkle-cut fries are awesome, especially with their fry sauce."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was sloooooooow and not a lot of service to actually speak of. Our waitress was nice but we didn't see her very often. We were sat by the hostess without menus and the waitstaff walked past us 4 - 5 times without even acknowledging us sitting there. After about 7 minutes a waitress stopped and asked if we had menus. We spent almost 2 hours sitting there for a couple burgers, meatloaf and some chicken nuggets. Waiting that long with 3 kids under 9 with nothing to do was not enjoyable at all. It took so long i actually just gave the waitress my CC without seeing the bill since i didn't know when she would be by again.

the food is not worth the money ,,poor service and a very rude manager,,we went for eater brunch and i had a cupcake i couldnt eat,,the waitress gave me a box to bring it home and the manager jumped all over that poor lady,,and the food was cold at 9am in the morning,,this place sucks"}
{"text":"This place gets busy, so it's bet to get here a little early, but the food, service and ambiance are definitely worth it. Absolutely delicious food and super reasonable pricing. My fiancé and I have definitely found our hidden little gem on our way to and from Vegas"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food and friendly welcoming staff! Best biscuits and gravy ever! A must stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger! Made from scratch, not a frozen patty. Did fall apart a little, but I didn't care... Also great cheese sticks. Again, not out of a box - they make them out of pepper jack."}
{"text":"I've waited to express my review hoping food quality and customer service would improve. No dice here. The watered down ranch, lukewarm soup, inconsistent service. Oh and if you mention you have a 15% off coupon you can bet your food will take twice the time to prepare. My wife and I ordered the breakfast special and a bacon burger with fried mushrooms on a Sunday late Morning 11:35am. At 12:10 we got the mushrooms and at 12:20 we got our food. Really 45min. For two plate order. Anyways as you can read owner never replies to reviews and YES I've seen him or who ever is in charge at the time be very dismissive to customers who question an order. Owner needs to improve restroom issues ASAP. We've given this place more than enough chances to improve. We've brought these same issues to their attention but seems to fall on deaf ears or there is a serious lack of communication. If your a local resident you might remember this place was on channel 13s dirty dinning episode. We found this out from a friend we were discussing with of places to eat at in BC. Sad to to say but WE will not be patronizing this restaurant again. See ya!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on the way to the Hoover Dam. The fried French toast is a must have! Cute decor and the service was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to stop in. Great choice. I ordered their slaw burger and it was big, juicy, flavorful and messy as a burger should be and it didn't lack an excellent bun.I used to consider pit stop the best burger in boulder, I think that this place really is a good competitor. The service was exemplary and I would come back. The restroom was clean as well as the restaurant. I love the 24hr menu as well get anything at anytime. Will be back. Plus there is a drive through."}
{"text":"On the way to the Hoover Dam, we stopped by this place because it looked kind of fun and we were hungry. Turns out it's a great place! Food was very good, especially the fries (my girlfriend said they were the BEST fries she'd ever had in her LIFE -- I don't know if I'd go that far, but if not they were pretty close). Prices are reasonable as well. Friendly staff and warm and welcoming atmosphere. Biker gangs all over the place. Lots of character. Stop by!"}
{"text":"We had lunch after visiting Hoover dam. We choose two different burgers and they where  really awesome. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"This is such a great little hole in the wall. It is a wonderful place to eat as a family. They were also to easily cater to my gluten free needs. We have eaten there multiple times and never gotten sick. This is our go to restaurant when we go out for a family meal. Amazing service, as well."}
{"text":"Ok, this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?

The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared. 

I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day. 

I'll be back. You should give them a try too."}
{"text":"Great spot in Boulder City. Menu is affordable with a nice variety. I had a delicious hamburger and sweet potato fries with their special sauce. Lindsay gave us warm attentive service and someone else (manager? Owner?) checked on us as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Half order of French toast was cold and way over priced. They were not particularly friendly either and I am a local. Let's hope they can turn things around, so that they will continue to stay open after the I-11 bypass goes through and they lose the majority of the tourists."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Reasonable prices.
Visiting family and took a trip out to the dam. 
Burgers, fries, sandwiches. Breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot in our little town outside of town. Amazing food, great service; this is a must try! Ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cute little place if you're in Boulder. The food was good, and the service was great! The girls who served us were very friendly and attentive. I tried the French dip with Sweet Potato Fries. The sandwich had a nice buttery taste to it from the bread/dip, and the fries were served piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Driving through town and planned to go to Milo's but the car show was in town so we circled back to this little Gem!  The service was fantastic and the Kobe burger was great medium rare with a fried egg  the chili mac and cheese had a unique taste to it and was yummy as well! As we sat outside on a sunny afternoon we got to enjoy the peacefulness of the cars driving by with a chocolate milkshake of course. 
This will definitely be a go to when in Boulder City! Skip the crowd and try it you will not be disappointed! 
Another plus is the food came out quick!!"}
{"text":"i live in b.c. and frequent little city grill but no more,3 out of the last 5 times i picked up my food the coleslaw was rancid and saturday was the last straw,if you want to get sick go there otherwise stay away,did not even want to eat the fish threw it away!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a bite. The service was great and food was delicious. We stopped after the morning at Hoover Dam! Right off the highway"}
{"text":"Visited the Hoover Dam today and found this gem on Yelp to stop for lunch before returning to the strip. Amazing food, extremely warm hospitality, huge portions, and delicious drinks! Best fried cheese sticks ever with pepper jack in place of the usual mozzarella. Yum!! The owner even hooked up fireball shots for our buddy's birthday! If you're anywhere nearby and hungry, just go eat already. And plan on a nap afterwards. Great people, interesting menu, and cold AC. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where art thou Star Burger?!  No worries, it is still pretty much the same.  Same fresh cut curly fries, same Red, White & Bleu (Burger), same friendly service.  Stand by......
Previous Review as I found nothing much other than the decor really changed.

Previous Review from the now defunct Star Burger.......
Star Burger is my favorite burger joint when I feel the need to raise my cholesterol by means of greasy goodness when I find myself in Boulder City.

Be sure to check the special burger sign located in the dining area.  On my first visit after ordering my meal, I looked up and saw that the specialty burger of the unknown time frame was one that had Spam on it!  Oh how I long to be there when it makes it's return.

So back to my first visit, I ordered up the Red, White & Blue Burger.  The combination of bleu cheese, ranch and bacon is incredible.

Couple that with with the homemade curly fries (don't forget to ask for extra fry sauce) and your in for one yummy artery clogging meal.

Once I ordered the same meal and threw a vanilla milkshake into the mix. It was a case of taste buds overriding common sense. But I didn't regret it. My stomach did.  

Afterwards I sat in my truck, drunk with fat and high on calories and thought to myself, if I have a heart attack right now it would be ok because it was awesome meal.

I have since tried the Bacon Burger, curly fires with extra sauce. I was not let down by the tastiness of that burger either.

The best bang for your buck is the Basic Burger Meal.  It comes with fries and a drink.  It's less than seven bucks.

I have my RX for Lipitor ready....Can't wait for the return Spam Burger or whatever else for that matter my next trip has in store for me!

Different name, different owners, different ambiance....Little City Grille is awesome and will be my burger joint of choice whenever I am in the \"Mayberry of the Mojave!\""}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat after Hoover Dam and the service was super friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"We stayed in Boulder City to go see the Hoover Dam.  We stayed at the center of town where there were lots of little restaurants and bars, but we decided to try The Little City Grille because of the great Yelp reviews.  We were NOT disappointed.  

This is a very cozy, down to Earth restaurant with a very calm, cool, family restaurant ambiance that was authentic.  It's small, rustic, in a quiet corner of town, and we loved it!  They have a small bar at the entrance, in addition to a handful of tables inside, and a few tables in an outdoor patio outside facing the street.

It was a Saturday night when we walked in and we were immediately greeted with a warm welcome, and was quickly seated, with fast and friendly service with a smile.  Our hostess was part of this family owned restaurant and it was obvious that she cared.  She was soft spoken, patient, and just made us feel very welcome.  Not always the case during our numerous road trips in the South West.  The food was very good too.  The dessert, which was Tropical Fruit Bread Pudding, was amazing!  We were so happy with the service and the food we returned the next morning for breakfast.  Again, we weren't disappointed!  My wife ordered the Corn Beef breakfast special and we were amazed because it was REAL corn beef made from scratch!  I know this seems silly to be amazed at but having eaten at many restaurants, it's rare they get this one right.  The Little City Grille got this right.  I got the 410 Omelet, which had every meat known to man and it was damn good!  Everything tasted fresh and cooked correctly.  The Chef/Owner came out to ask us how everything was both times we were there.  How we wish there was a restaurant like this where we live in South Orange County, CA!  

We give The Little City Grille in Boulder City, NV 5-stars!"}
{"text":"We came here as an alternative to our first choice which had a 30+ minute wait. Good idea! Some of the best French toast I've ever had! Hubby loved the corned beef hash special too. Very cute inside and the wait staff was super friendly and very attentive. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Best food we've had in awhile made our trip more enjoyable thank you very much Andrea and Rick"}
{"text":"Nice little cozy place though a bit too small.   Had the cod with the veggies which was very good.  Good service and good menu selections.  Will go back to try something different."}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant with good food and good service!

We stopped in for lunch while in the area.  Service here was very friendly!  She was busy during this lunch hour but we weren't ignored at all.   

I chose the club with sweet potato fries.  The club was huge and so filling! It was piled  with turkey, bacon and the regular sandwich toppings.  The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked and so delicious! 

The place itself was small but clean.  The restroom was located around the back.  It was a little strange to walk outside to the back door... But the bathroom was fine.  

It was a good place for lunch and wouldn't hesitate to stop back in."}
{"text":"Clam chowder was best I've ever had- and that includes Boston and Seattle area chowder!"}
{"text":"Excelent service and food, Love everything about this place, best mac and cheese that I have ever had,  I ordered the south of the Border burger with sweet pot and it was delicious .We will be back soon. If you are driving to vegas.
Stop by and have a delicious meal in a one of a kind friendly restaurant.
LOVE  THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Our family just finished eating \"Linner\" here and are really glad we found this 'hidden gem' on our way back from sightseeing Hoover Dam.  We prefer to support the mom and pop places and after seeing that Evan's Old Time Grille was closed, we stumbled upon this place, which was in Google Maps as \"Star Burger\".  An unexpectedly classy ambiance inside this restaurant sets it aside from the fast food burger joint it apparently used to be (complete with drive through).  Service was quick, not rushed, and friendly.  Our glasses did my go empty, and the food didn't disappoint...especially the kids who gobbled it down.  Pasta primavera was classy and delicious...and what better way to end a meal than with soft serve ice cream cones and a 'to-die-for' peanut butter shake!  If you pass by Boulder city and miss this place, then you're missing out on a special treat!"}
{"text":"Heading back from the Hoover Dam to Vegas, we saw all these cute restaurants. How to pick? There were 8 of us, how to find something for everyone? I read some reviews on yelp and settled on this one. We were thrilled with our choice from the minute we walked in. Loved all the quotes decorating the place. The homemade veggie burger had chunks of squash. The homemade curly fries were probably the best fries I've ever had. Other things we ordered - bacon cheeseburger, a burger loaded with lots of stuff including an egg and we started our meal with fried pickles. The fry sauce was a nice added touch. Everything was out of this world. However, I was not impressed with their side salad, I would have expected their blue cheese dressing to be homemade. 
I would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice local diner for lunch after going to Hoover Dam and found this place by using yelp. It had 4.5 stars and deserved more. I had the Kobe burger and my wife had the bacon cheese burger. Both meals were great and the service was excellent. If your in the business district of Boulder, stop in and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Lee is the owner/operator and really goes the extra mile in service and quality.  Our server was 'jessie' and served our table of thirteen fabulously. I recommend The Little City Grille without reservation.  
I suggest the LA as a sandwich and the Swiss mushroom with avocado.  Our family enjoyed the pasta dishes and the 'Southwestern'"}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch meal. The crispy French toast LA Wrap with special sauce and the curly fries (best part) were great. Very affordable at $25 for two of us. I will definitely be back when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast with family. Breakfast served all day. Relaxed atmosphere, nothing fancy, but the food was great and more than enough. Service was attentive but not annoying."}
{"text":"This place has great personality and food. We stopped here on our way from the Grand Canyon to Vegas. We ordered a 5-9er and veggie burger. They both rocked. The sweet potato fries are awesome. Customer service was extremely friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch.  Had 3 children with us and they loved the grilled cheese and chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place. I had been wanting to try it out for months and well,  I'm sad I did.  We came for dinner, place looks run down and dirty. Only 1 waitress/hostess who had an attitude and service was VERY slow...mind you, there were only 3 tables sat at, ours included.  My chicken wrap was beyond bland and the fries were terribly undercooked, I would have asked her to send them back but I had earlier witnessed another customer send her burger back and I saw the disgust and frustration on her face, I didn't want to deal with the attitude.  Maybe they are better for breakfast, but I will stick to Southwest diner just down the block!"}
{"text":"Two stars for quaint little place with cute atmosphere.   Exactly what we wanted to find in Boulder City.  No stars for anything else. 

The server was sweet but not very attentive.   The bathroom is out behind the building and somewhat unfortunate. Finally,  the food. Not good.  Fries were ok but the chicken on our chicken sandwiches was terrible.  Dry, weird looking and flavorless."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I really enjoy this little gem. First things first, Brandy( sorry if I didn't spell it right) is the sweetest ever! She treats you as if she's known you forever and just makes you feel comfortable and welcome. She also makes sure that you have everything you need and that you're happy with what you're eating. She knows the menu like the back of her hand, and when she says something is good... it's good! The food is DE LISH! We started with the pepper jack cheese sticks this time, and they were so good. I was a little skeptical cause I'm pretty much the mozzarella stick queen, but these were great. My fiancé got the fish fry with clam chowder, and I got the steak with chicken enchilada soup, and HOLD THE FRIGGIN Phone! The soup was sooooooo good. I honestly could have ordered another both and said screw the dinner, but I didn't . The steak was perfectly medium , so tender and so juicy. The mashed potatoes and gravy were delish, and the mixed squashes were yummy too. My fiancé loved the clam chowder ( I even liked it and I'm now a chowder type of gal) and LOVEDDDD the fish fry. Came with a huge piece of fish, shrimp, clam strips, and fries. We left so satisfied. Everything about this place is great, from the atmosphere, to the staff, to the food. If you're rollin through Boulder City, make sure to stop!"}
{"text":"Wow! Drove past it and had to turn around. Found this little gem on our way to hoover dam. Had to stop and get some breakfast. Great service. Great food. Average prices that I'm accustomed to in Wisconsin. If I ever head back out there, it will be a spot I stop back at."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Little city Grill quite a few times. Each time hoping it would get better, the food is served luke warm.. The water glass dirty, silver ware dirty, and the ;last 2 visits I was very sick after eating there.  Food poisoning is not a joke.. Hot water is a must have in all establishments where food is prepared. I knew they were on Dirty dining in the past.. BUT I really did like some of the wait staff, and there have been a few times where my food, although not great, was not horrible.. Just bland, not hot and nothing to brag about.  Then I see they were on dirty dining again.. AGAIN.. this time the owner/manager, showed his true colors.. He was hostile and got physical with Darcy spears. She has to tell him to not touch her, apparently he thinks it is OK to put his hands on a lady.. Then he grabbed their news equipment and walked away with it, tossing ti to the ground.. I urge folks to contact the city council.. He needs to be put out of business. If he reacts this way with little regard to the public health (C grade twice) !!! Plus anger issues.. Stating Darcy was the  bottom of the feeder pool.. Uh sorry dude, your eatery is the bottom when you don;t clean your place and it is disgusting.. You could become like Fire Fly and be sued for public health and cause an epidemic.. Hot water, clean food equipment & storage is not optional, it is Mandatory.. I am in Boulder a lot, and I will never eat here again.. And if you care about your loved ones health, please let folks know.. I hope the owner/manager gets anger management help.. He obviously has other stuff going on in his life to be so hostile.."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We stop in everytime we're in boulder city. Always clean, great service and great food! Would definitely recommend! Also has the cutest decor!"}
{"text":"Came into this small eatery because I was craving for a cheeseburger. The interior of this place had the 1960's feel (black and white photos and memoirs of Elvis Presley's time) with the rustic look or modern furniture. What was cool is that they also have antiques sitting on the window sill inside. This place feels like a relaxed moment in a cafe. Me and my partner was on the way to go to a beer fest in Boulder city and what better way to get some grub before alcohol.

The hostess quickly greeted us once we walked in and seated us next to the window. Then suddenly, a little girl in a dress catered is menus! So cute.

I ordered the Kiebalsa burger and it came with 100% ground beef, fried ham, cheese and mushrooms with your choice of (curly,crinkly,sweet potato fries) and a drink. It was amazing. The flavor a was all there and the bread was moist. If it's not for their burgers I would come back for their great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Well kept secret!!! Located in Boulder City's historic downtown in a small shoebox shaped building.  Despite the long line they commit to memory vs making you a your name on a list"}
{"text":"Their Kobe burger was so delicious with all variety of fries. Mimosa was yummy! Our wait staff was attentive and helpful. Food came out quickly. It was a relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is flippin' ADORABLE! 

We were greeted by everyone when we walked in, and luckily there was no wait. The server made some suggestions on breakfast items, and I am glad she did, everything we ate was a delight! I got a Portland omelette and my boyfriend got the homemade corn beef hash. But the toast was probably the best thing I have ever ate (Yes, I said TOAST). I don't know how they do it, but you have to go in and try for yourself. 

This will be our \"go-to\" spot whenever we find ourselves in Boulder City . Skip the Coffee Cup and go straight here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A \"C\" Grade twice......ugghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I seen it on the news, ask the manager or look it up on FaceBook"}
{"text":"Little City Grill is probably the cutest little place in Boulder City- despite the dedicated parking area for motorcycles, the interior is decked out in grandma's finest country decor. It's a cozy spot with warm and attentive service. Though the menu highlights their burgers, I opted for a healthier choice with their BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, which is also featured as a favorite customer item. The salad was huge and fresh, with plenty of veggies and just the right balance of ranch and barbecue sauces to give it flavor without drowning it in sauce. I'll update when I go back for their Kobe burger!"}
{"text":"Cute old school classic american diner. Good food, cozy uplifting environment and first class small town service."}
{"text":"Best little restaurant / cafe  on your way in or out of Vegas!!   Delicious food, friendly service, overall wonderful!!  Had the special of the day - turkey avocado wrap in a spinach tortilla & aioli sauce - with sweet potato fries.....YUMMY!!  My wife had the green chili burger with curly fries......YUMMY too!!!  Cool eclectic decor with old time, interesting historical photos of the Boulder City area.   This place is a must go to eatery when you need a tasty meal just outside of Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. My wife and I stopped in today, with only a short time for lunch. The waitress was wonderful and very attentive to our time crunch. We both had the LA wraps and throughly enjoyed them. This was our second time there and will be back on future trips through Boulder City. 

Although we weren't on two wheels, we do appreciate that they are motorcycle friendly including dedicated moto parking."}
{"text":"What a gem!  If you  haven't had opportunity to stop in here it's your loss!  We've been stopping by this little spot for years even as it changed owners and directions.  It used to be a great ice cream stop years ago.  Now it's a yummy spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  I was a little concerned, being vegetarian, that I wouldn't find anything to eat here since it looked to be a burger joint, but it's much more than that!  Turns out, they make the best veggie burgers from scratch that I've ever had... and their Zucchini Planks with ranch....
well...lets just say I may be driving out to BC for a snack from now on!  Atmosphere is great, the food is delicious, and the people are awesome!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We tried the black and Bleu burger, the mushroom burger and a pork chop. The pork chop was not good. However the burgers were really good. Loved the atmosphere and charm of this little gem in Boulder City. Staff is friendly and great. I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Came here after a very hot day at the Hoover Dam and after reading reviews.  Thanks Yelpers....great find! We came w 2 kids ages 5 and 8, along with 3 adults.  It was late and we were starving.  Our food arrived promptly and it was great.  Another great thing was that they had tablets for the kids to play with. Too bad that they did not have enough for  each of the kids because someone had stolen one of them.  Gosh, how many places provide tablets for kids?  Don't steal them!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Found it on our way through boulder city heading towards the Hoover dam. We are vegetarians and they have some really good options for vegetarians. Their veggie burger is phenomenal, freshly cut chunks of 11 different vegetables. You can see and taste the freshness and the flavor. It's paired with a house made mustard. I'm not a huge fan of mustard so I got a side of their fry sauce which is a ketchup and mayo mix with spices, delicious and went great with the veggie burger. Their curly fries are seasoned and while not that crispy have a very good flavor with the fry sauce. The last thing we tried were the fried pepper jack sticks. Thy are kind of like mozzarella sticks but house made, hand breaded. The breading was very crispy and the house made marinara to go with it was also delicious. I was extremely satisfied all in all. The service was also great. The waitress was very helpful with all our questions and helping us make substitutions and advice on plate sizing. We shared the veg burger and cheese sticks and left the place stuffed after a complimentary basket of fries. I wish this place was closer to Vegas so I could go more often. It's still good enough to warrant the long drive from Vegas though every now and then"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Had the spicey tortilla soup, which was excellent with fresh veggies, a craft beer from Seattle in an ice cold glass, and the 9 oz steak with whipped potatoes and more fresh veggies. Everything was excellent!

Even gave us dessert on the house, great cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service.   Hubby has Kobe burger and Mac and cheese as side.  He loved it.  I had the ruben sandwich and curly fries.  Everything hot and fresh.  Be back next time we come through town"}
{"text":"We stopped by on our way home from Vegas. They were so friendly there! They helped my Father in-law with his wheelchair and made us feel like they really were happy we were there. The decor is so cute, lots of fun signs to read and plenty to select from on the menu. 

We loved our food! The potatoes were amazing with onions and peppers! I wish I had some right now and the bread is extra thick. 

Anytime we are in the area we will be stopping by LCG to get some great food and say hello to the friendly staff! Thanks, Little City Grille! I told you I'd Yelp you when I got home!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast and lunch there with it's was 3 of us and it was small, cute, quick, amazing food with an awesome server!  Thanks for the good stuff until next time!  We had the popcorn shrimp, blueberry French toast, curly fries, breakfast burrito and potatoes."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, great food and service, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices! Very friendly servers and a charming little restaurant with lots of homemade food. The Kobe beef burger was delicious and cooked perfectly, and the veggie burger was made from scratch!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat after visiting The Hoover Dam, and we happened to come across this little gem. It's a cute little restaurant with a beautifully decorated interior and a red exterior. Let me just say that the food was spectacular--you can tell that the food is made fresh, and the fries are very crispy and delicious, which is a definite plus. My friend got the Kobe burger, and I got the Philly Steak n Cheese sandwich. I usually don't finish all of my food, but I did this time since the food was just so good. In addition to the amazing food, the service was also great! The lady who helped us was very nice and was always checking up on us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything else. She really made our visit a good one, and I would definitely come back here if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"A MUST GO TO PLACE!!!!!!!!
2 things... Ate at the coffee cup last Sunday it was ok and would definitely pick this place over them again. The chicken fried steak was a home run. I think of myself as a chicken fried steak connoisseur and this place is the closest I've found to my moms growing up. You can tell its fresh and not frozen and deep fried like everyone else. Service was spot on and even had flavored creamer for coffee. My fiancé had pancakes and bacon which I tasted and was good. Great menu to choose from. When I do go back it will be again the chicken fried steak. OH AND EVERYTHING IS HOMEMADE 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!!!!!!!!!

I also got the 410 breakfast wrap thats like a big breakfast burrito. Had half this am and would recommend as well"}
{"text":"This is the second visit to this hidden gem. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The food was comforting and delicious. Wonderful atmosphere, soothing music and great food. Will certainly make this a must go to place when in the area."}
{"text":"Great little spot to have lunch on your way to Hoover Dam. Lee is the owner from Salem, Oregon, and he is a wonderful host and stopped by our table several times to make sure we were taken good care of and also gave us some good recommendations for stops along the way for the kids. The homemade ranch and fry sauce is amazing - we had French onion soup, side salad, LA  wrap, mac & cheese, and a delicious cheeseburger at our table. There was only one person in the restaurant when we got there initially so we were a little nervous but by the time we left at noon the entire place was full - obviously the word has gotten out. Thank you LCG for a wonderful lunch and thank you Lee and staff!"}
{"text":"great little restaurant in Boulder after our paddleboarding excursion, vast choices of craft beers, food, sandwhiches and wraps

would come again"}
{"text":"Just ate at The Little City Grill - had chef salad and husband had burger, both very good - especially the sweet potato fries!  Staff very attentive!  Good prices!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this was the best burger I've ever had. My husband thought so too.
I ordered the signature burger with fried egg, green chilies, bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup (no bun). He ordered the slaw burger.
Husband says it was the best slaw he's ever had too. 
Excellent service, even on a busy day! 
Will definitely make it a habit to stop in each time we are in boulder city."}
{"text":"After a long day at the Hoover Dam we stopped for lunch and I'm so glad we did ! 
Best little place to eat in Boulder City. 
My bother and husband loved the freshness of the hamburger and the salad I had was amazing !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food and great price! Jesse did an amazing job serving us and on top of it. Highly recommend this place! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family and had an excellent late lunch. Two loved the bacon cheeseburgers, one enjoyed the crispy chicken wrap, and I loved the mac-n-cheese. There was so much mac-n-cheese in the bowl that the fam dug in to help finish it. We had had a very expensive dinner the previous night at a chain steakhouse in Phoenix, but we all agreed that this lunch tasted much better than the dinner."}
{"text":"Yum!  We left hoover dam hungry and this place hit the spot.  Burgers were excellent as was the cheese steak - curly fires and sweet potato fries were delicious.  Cute place - would recommend for a hungry lunch plus all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Omg!! This place is amazing! Decor is great, service amazing, and food.... best we have had in a while!! If you are in the area make sure you stop by. It's almost like you are visiting grandma and she is giving you her amazing food!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and checked the yelp reviews and decided on this amazing gem. Definitely amazing in many ways. Food was great and the servings were large. Brandy was incredibly nice and personable. It was truly a pleasure to dine here and I definitely suggest you do so too! We'll be back 100%"}
{"text":"Took a spontaneous trip to the Hoover Dam, since I've never seen it before. Was really hungry and decided to see what Yelp can suggest to help my hunger LOL. And we decided on this cute little place on the side of the road. It was a beautiful day outside so we chose to sit outside. They do not have a lot of seating for outside maybe like 4-5 tables. The staff here is very friendly and the food was delicious. I would definitely come here during the weekend just to enjoy the weather and the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after visiting Hoover Dam. What a great little gem of a place! The LA Wrap and Reuben were both really good, but the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. You've gotta try 'em! Quaint building with such history. And our server was cute as a button and just as sweet as can be. Good value for the price too....Neither one of us could finish our meal! Highly recommend that you check it out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little place! Typically I go to the coffee cup but since today was Easter they were closed so I decided to try this place out and I am so glad that I did. Their corned beef and hash was the best I have ever tasted and their country fried steak was amazing too. Service here was by far superb! I will definitely be coming back here all the time!"}
{"text":"Holy cats!! This was the best choice we made on our vacation!  The hamburger was fabulous with a fresh baked roll as the bun. The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had anywhere. Service was great and this is a worthy stop!!"}
{"text":"Rude ass service staring from the main woman servicing. Tried to push us to sit outside in hot ass weather. Then when we got a table I knew why. Cause we had a big group of 9 with 6 kids. And pretty loud in there and the old lady had the nerve to tell my son speak with your inside voice twice while touching his shoulder. Horrible don't ever go here unless you want to whisper."}
{"text":"What a cute and quaint place. The service was awesome & very friendly. We made a stop here on the way to Laughlin. We ordered the cheese sticks, a Philly sandwich with curly fries, Bacon Burger with sweet potato fries and a kids hamburger with regular fries. Everything was flavorful and the cheese sticks were awesome! You can tell they were made fresh and not frozen! 

I would definitely recommend this cute restaurant."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, fun little place to stop by and enjoy a great mean. We will have to do it again.  The French toast are incredible."}
{"text":"Unassuming from the outside and in, this little cafe is an oasis in the dessert. Having eaten the Kobe burger with curly fries and finished off with a piece of delicious home made chocolate cake, it was a piece of heaven on earth - as though time had stood still. I highly recommend this place. If you are a high maintenance high brow person don't bother coming here as I wouldn't welcome you either. If you're a real person and down to earth, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really vintage feel. Great service with very friendly employees. But overall, really good food! Like... REALLY good food! Not like Denny's or other diners. The food is unbelievable."}
{"text":"We stopped here with the entire family after hiking the old railroad tunnels outside of Boulder City.   The place gets great reviews on Yelp so we thought it was worth a shot.  It's a small and homey restaurant located on the North end of Nevada Way.  We were greeted within seconds of walking in and given our choice of tables.  The interior is small, but well decorated and very clean.   

The food was very good.  3 of my kids had burgers and loved them.  My wife had burger with sweet potato fries and remarked it was one of the best burgers she's ever had.   I had a chicken/avocado wrap and curly fries.  The wrap was ok - not spectacular.  It was a little bland.  I added some fry sauce to it and it was much better (maybe a tip to the cook - add something else to the chicken wrap). 

Overall, a nice place.  We'd stop again if visting Boulder City."}
{"text":"What a terrific find!  Stopped In for the atmosphere and to support a local place. What a delight to find a delicious veggie burger, and some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  The husband's club sandwich, which the menu said was \"voted the best,\" did not disappoint.   Terrific service, great atmosphere. A gem."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great casual atmosphere. The young couple working while we were there were super friendly and helpful.
The breakfast plates are actually platters. 
I had the breakfast special, corned beef hash.  It was actually deconstructed hash. Shredded corned beef cooked with onion was served along side of their breakfast potatoes, with eggs and toast.
It was a ton of food and tasty, but it lost something by not being cooked together.

They serve breakfast, lunch, and supper AND have a driveup window if you call ahead. Cute signage and decor."}
{"text":"We usually come for lunch but made it out there for breakfast. This place is as good if not better than some of the other spots in BC. My husband had an omelette and I had a breakfast wrap. Their potatoes are delicious and homemade. You can really taste the freshness in their produce. Gravy   was tasty and the coffee was fresh! Looking forward to seeing the owner (who always comes out to greet the customers and to ensure they are having a good experience ) and our favorite server Ginny again soon :)"}
{"text":"This is a cute little café with indoor and outdoor seating right on the main drag in Boulder City!! Great breakfast with attentive service, mom had the pancakes and really raved about them, but then again she doesn't get out much!  LOL    Just kidding, the food was fantastic and you can take Mom's word for it, she's 80 and says its a damn good pancake and will back hand me if I say otherwise!!  Better go get some!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Friendly waitress, great service and good food. The Mac & cheese is a must try ;-)"}
{"text":"Awesome little place & wonderful service from Jessie!! Thanks for serving us in the tiny paradise oasis just outside Las Vegas!!! We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Made a stop on our way back to Phoenix.  The hamburgers and fries were delish and cooked perfectly!  The service was fast and very friendly.  Our family would definitely make a stop here again."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had anywhere in a while. Great service. Lots of fun things to look at. GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I shared a slaw burger and a green chile burger, curly fries and sweet potatoes fries. Sweet potato fries were outstanding everything else, including iced tea was okay. Service was fast and friendly. All in all a great value and we will be back."}
{"text":"We knew that we wanted to get something to eat before getting to Hoover Dam from Las Vegas.  We just googled nearby restaurants when we got into town.  Little City Grille had a high rating and we like trying new places that aren't a restaurant chain.  

We stopped in probably about 11am to have a late breakfast.  We were greeted by very friendly staff.  We were provided a menu and told of the specials for the day.  We decided to order one of the specials - the Mexican Sunrise.  We also ordered a full order of their World Famous French Toast.  WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY!!!!!  The food was delicious, from the hot flavorful coffee all the way to the homemade salsa (you must try it)!!!  We continuously talked about how good the food was for the rest of our trip and strongly considered driving back there from Vegas the next morning for breakfast again.  

If you're ever in Boulder City, NV - don't miss this place, you must stop in and try the food!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say?!? It was delicious!!! Definitely worth stopping by on the way to or from the Hoover Dam! Great service, great food, it doesn't get any better than that!!! Oh yeah, reasonably priced and they serve  beer!!"}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable price. Friendly staff. Chicken fried steak is highly recommended. The bathroom is a little inconvenient but definitely would top in again!"}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped for breakfast on the recommendation of a family member. Great choice! Dad had the french toast dipped in cornflakes and fried - delicious. I had the corned beef hash. It was a little different from the normal hash in that the meat and the potatoes were not grilled up together but the corned beef had been crisped and were served next to the potatoes o'brian and the eggs. The place is small but has full bar. Service was attentive and friendly! We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here is pretty good but the Friday clam chowder is amazing. Rich, thick and flavorful with tender clams. It is better than a lot of chowders I have gotten on the coast. Nice ambiance inside as well. Well done, guys!"}
{"text":"We have been there about 5 times and usually love it... Great burgers and LOVE the crinkle cut fries. However, last week we ordered a club sandwich that was not toasted but grilled like grilled cheese very greasy and not good. The bacon was undercooked. Also got the chicken finger dinner and revieced 4 tiny fingers and fries for 8.50... We decided this was a bad item choice and ordered the taco salad and cheese steak this week and were pleased.. The staff is nice the place is clean.. Always have the food done quickly"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful waitress.  I had the 5 alarm burger and it was great.  My kids liked it as well especially the shakes."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bacon Onion Rings Burger and curly fries. The hamburger was a work of art. Ate more fries than I intended to too."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. The cornflake crusted french toast was delicious!
Main reason not a 5 was that the coffee is not good and at a breakfast place, that is a consideration."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, great prices.  Worth the short drive from Vegas.  Relaxing atmosphere.  Fried zucchini was a hit!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Hoover dam, this is the place for a lunch stop. The food is delicious. The café is darling. And the waitress is just as sweet as she can be. I had the Philly steak sandwich and it was really tasty. My husband had the chili and mac & cheese And enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Nice little place, good family environment.  The food was good, nice serving size and flavor was great.  I loved the decor of the restaurant.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you go to Hoover Dam. The place is cute and quaint. The lady serving was adorable, super nice, and helpful. Very homey and food is really good!
They even have a kids menu!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with great service! Although they did not have anything vegan on the menu, they did allow me to customize the breakfast burrito! The only reason I didn't give a 5 stars is they allow dogs on their patio but said they couldn't let our German Sheppard pup, who is 8 months old and in training to be a service dog. Kind of a bummer that we had to leave her in the truck and keep goin out to check on her."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger and cure fries.  Consistently good.  You have to check out the wonderful quotes on the bathroom wall.  Been here a few times.  Coffee is good.  Service is responsive."}
{"text":"What a pleasant find this place was! I just so happen to get stuck on a project for the Bureau of Reclamation (this is the company that is responsible for the building and maintaining of Hoover Dam) down the street. So when lunch came around, a search of restaurants on the trusty Yelp app on my phone yielded several results including this one.

So I arrive at this place right off of Nevada Way. From the outside it looks rather small. But as soon as you go inside, it is quite spacious. Immediately I am greeted by a nice lady and am sat down. As I go over the menu, I see that they have a lot of good selections ranging from breakfast, lunch, and dinner items all the way down to nice appetizers and good dessert options. Once I made up my mind what to get, I knew I would have to come back some other time to try out their other selections.

I was in the mood for a burger so I went with their most basic burger which was the 9 to 5 burger (5.50). You start with a third pound angus beef patty topped with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes and mayo. I asked if I could have onions added and the nice lady asked if I wanted grilled or regular. With a smile on my face I said both please! I also wanted some fries and my choices were crinkle, sweet potato, or curly. I opted for the curly (2.65). I just went with water as my drink.

When I got my burger and fries, man was pumped to dig in but not before I took a pic first. As you can see from my pic, it is a decent sized burger and the curly fries were a generous portion. The burger itself was cooked medium so it was really juicy just how I liked it. You can tell the fries were hand cut and cooked fresh just by the texture. Since it was a late lunch, I didn't realize I was that hungry until I scarfed down the whole thing.

When I got my bill, the overall total with tax was 8.81. Big ups for no charge on the onions! 

The overall ambiance of the place has somewhat of a homey, cozy feel to it. I would say there were plenty of tables and chairs to accommodate about 25 people. Not bad for it looking like a small place.

Some random info: Hours are 7 am to 8 pm everyday. They actually have drive thru! The lady that served me even told me that the place used to be a Tastee Freeze restaurant, hence the reason why they kept the drive thru. They only have one unisex bathroom and you gotta go outside towards the back of the restaurant to access it. If it is locked, that means there is somebody in it. I gotta say it was pretty nice and clean. They have free wifi.

Overall, I was impressed with everything from the moment I stepped foot in the building up until I left. You can view their menu from their website, www.littlecitygrille.com

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #32"}
{"text":"We needed to eat after taking in the Hoover Dam and then waiting for the sun to set so that the drive with the kids into Vegas would show them the lights.

This was a perfect stop... the restaurant was friendly and clean but not formal.  Do check the hours... we lucked in and showed up just before closing but didn't catch any grief for making them stay a little late, though they did appreciate that we ordered quickly.  They didn't rush us while they closed up the restaurant and the waitress patiently listened to my 10-year-old's history of our trip.

The food was basic but good... good family food.

-joe"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Little City Grille on our way through and we found a gem. The service was fantastic and the food even better. My husband had the grilled chicken wrap and I had the southwest chicken sandwich and both very very tasty. Food was served quickly. The atmosphere in this little grill is uplifting, friendly and a combination of locals and tourists but the staff treated everybody like they have known us for years. We will stop on our way back through. After leaving Vegas this gem was a treat for weary travelers looking for a good meal and a friendly face."}
{"text":"Alright, so this place blew my hair back man. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by this waitress ( a very attractive young lass) who gave us some bomb a$$ service and then held it down some bomb a$$ food Thad this cool a$$ chef Sonny served up. The beer was thiccccc. The service was thiccccc and the food was thiccccc. Go here. 5/5 Bombs."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast - stop whenever we are passing through.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great service great food beef vegetable soup is a must try best bacon burger I've had hands down"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have to say every time I have been here I have not been disappointed. The food is fresh and by fresh I mean it's worth the wait - believe me. The portion sizes are huge. Don't think so, take a look at half of my order in the picture going home with me. Both pieces of fish were that size and the fries were double that. The wait staff is always friendly and made ya feel like we were at home. I definitely recommend the drive out here!"}
{"text":"Ok folks here it is. Great food, great service!  Stopped in on fish Friday!  Had chef salad and fish basket. Really tasty and a good value. Wife had a chef salad and the mac and cheese. Again, really good and also a good value. Expansive menu for such a small eatery. Really impresses. Only drawback is the restroom is out back. Small price to pay for the great upside to dining in  an eatery in a small town. Boulder is a welcome break to the sensory overload that they call Las Vegas. Check out the small shops on the main street. Lake mead and the Hoover dam are right down the road."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! Love the quaint atmosphere. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant.  My entire family enjoyed what they ordered. I had the Philly cheesesteak which was a perfect choice. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. The service was unbeatable. Very friendly atmosphere. If in the area I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great find after spending a short day trip down to Hoover Damn.  

Great little all American family run and owned diner.  

Cute place.  Great and super friendly service.

Every dish (we were a party of 5) was home made and made fresh to order.  

Really a very good find and will definitely go back when we go down to Boulder City."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. TC provides Great service and prompt food delivery. Chicken Fried Steak was delish, potatoes could have been done a little more....poached eggs were perfect. $15 with a tip without a drink is a bit spendy IMO thus the three stars."}
{"text":"3.5 Need an early morning stop for breakfast? LCG has got you covered.

Cute place with good, simple food. Nothing fancy, just very cute mom-and-pop type of place with just a lot of heart put into it. I think the food is a little pricey though, but it's a little tourist town, right?

- French toast- 4/5- tasty, but no one should make a meal out of pure sugar on a plate. We split this 3 ways as a starter, and it was the perfect amount of food. It's pretty dang pricey, too.
- Sourdough breakfast sandwich- 5/5
- Sunrise burrito- 3/5
- Breakfast potatoes- 4/5. Very impressed that one guy in the back was cranking out this much food, all done nicely.

We did a motorcycle trip up to Boulder City, and there is bike parking, which is a really nice touch. I'd say that this place caps off a motorcycle trip perfectly as it's sincere, good vibes at Little City Grille, too."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in NV so far. Crispy, corn flake covered french toast and friendly service made this a welcome stop on the drive out to Hoover Dam. Great music selections playing too."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it short and simple. Food is good and expensive. 
Service was rude because we were with a 2yr old. 
\"Table for 2?\" 
\"We have people already sitting.\" 
\"The ones with the BABY?, they're in the back!\"
Just a small taste of the experience."}
{"text":"Of all the places I've traveled and all the restaurants I have eaten at, this has got the be my most favorite place. It is the cutest little grill that claims to have guests leave as friends and they are true to their word. It feels like home. The service was amazing. Our waitress was so kind and other employees were nice enough to check in with us through our meal. We both had burgers which were just what we needed to seal the deal. At the end, with our check came two chocolate kisses. I love this place and everything about it. I love what it stands for and it made this the best meal I have ever had. I can't wait to come back. Love at first everything!"}
{"text":"Was greeted by the server right when we came in. Though it wasn't a busy restaurant, the vibe was real nice. Lots of little knick knacks to look at. Thier food was good, big enough of a portion for me to get full. Everytime a customer would walk in the waitress would always be there to say good morning and make her customers feel right at home. Though I forgot to take pictures of my food (the fried mushrooms was real good), I would come back again."}
{"text":"I wish our server would have introduced his name so I could include it in this review. He had great customer service tonight.

First time here and I felt like I was eating in my own kitchen. We ate outside and ordered  the philly steak n cheese and it was absolutely delicious. Good came out quickly, everything was good."}
{"text":"From San Diego and first time here. Had the Red White and Blue burger and was incredible."}
{"text":"My wife and I Found Little City Grille on Yelp and decide to try it out. We stopped there in our way to the Hoover Dam for breakfast Monday. We were not disappointed either. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had a couple eggs and an English muffin. We also split a Bacon Bloody Mary. I have to say it all delicious. The corned beef hash was cooked perfect and had lots of flavor. Corned beef wasn't stringy, but was very tender.. My wife's eggs also cooked perfect. The blood Mary was also really good not over powering. Could have been just a little spicier, but that it's just my preference. All in all I highly recommend them. If we are ever back in Nevada we will definitely stop there again."}
{"text":"We drove out from the cute downtown BC area to lunch here, as their website says they are super kid friendly (we have iPads and games and patio...) and also because of all of the high Yelp reviews. The kids menu isn't available to look at, but the waitress will tell you what they have. Everything for kids comes with fries and mac and cheese. It didn't come with the milk, so I ended up paying $9 for lunch for my 4 year old. Oh well. No sign of games or iPads or whatever. Cutely decorated, small place. Delicious milk shakes (soft serve ice cream). My kid ordered the hot dog.  He didn't eat any of it, as it was a monster sausage sized hot dog on a gigantic grilled bun - I'm not sure what kid south of 13 years old is going to be able to fit that thing in their craw. I tried cutting it up into small pieces for him, but then it wasn't hot dog shaped and he wasn't interested.  Anyway, I ordered the patty melt. The burger was dry and unseasoned, the onions were barely grilled...all of that would have still been fine but it WASN'T ON RYE BREAD.  Their patty melts are on two giant pieces of buttery Texas toast. I'm pretty sure the rye bread is in the definition of patty melt. If you're not going to do rye, then you should probably make note of that on the menu. And call it something else. Some other folks were eating the special of the day, a turkey pot pie, which is served in a bread bowl. Again, the pot pie part seems kind of integral to the whole thing, but apparently the rules of food are a little loose in BC. As evidenced by my sweet potato tots. Which are actually french fries. So there you go. If I were to visit here again, I would probably stick with a beer (they have a decent variety according to the menu) and some appetizers. And maybe one more milk shake."}
{"text":"Wonderful gem. Must try. I had 2 breakfast meals just to taste. Only ate 1/4 of each. I had their veggie wrap w/avocado & French toast. They dip it in corn flakes, a different twist. Everything was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"There is this racist guy that sits at the bar all the time. I don't want to hear that stuff. Not going back. If a business tolerates people like him, I'm not giving them my money."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place!? Well absolutely a good well deserved review! Our server was very polite (I didn't catcher her name) went out for lunch I yelped the closes place and it directed me to this little city grille. I ordered south of the border & can say it was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had! Must try it it's cheesy and very savory! I also had the sweet potato fries! Best fries I must say! I loved the ambience and the theme of the restaurant soo much to look around at. I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WOW! Okay walking in from the parking lot grabs you by the nose and says \"welcome, come in\". The cornflake crusted french toast was amazing, we had this for the first time at an acclaimed restaurant 2 days ago and it was great, but we both agreed that the acclaimed chef needs to come here to learn how to perfect it. The fruit parfait was enormous and the fruit was perfectly ripened, so many places look good, but this one delivered the goods. Now let's get to the Veggie breakfast burro, again wow. Must have sauteed each item individually and combined at the end or something g you could taste each bite and every ingredient distinctly. Best one I have had. Ok let's get to the heart of the place Randy and Jessie and company were like family, only nicer ;-) If you pass this place by, well you will be missing out...."}
{"text":"Such a warm welcoming place. I love it. The food is very good.  Atmosphere cozy.  I visit often!"}
{"text":"The little city grill is a really great place.  The food was excellent. We had the Mexican sunrise breakfast special and the biscuits & gravy.  Both meals were pretty damn good.  Food was hot and fresh.  This is not a greasy spoon in some dumpy little town.  The town of Boulder is adorable and so is the restaurant.  The ambiance and decorations are welcoming.  We had good service and the chef came out and asked us if we were satisfied.  

Great little eatery."}
{"text":"Came here due to the Yelp reviews and was VERY HAPPY!
Atmosphere, service, food, prices, drinks....EVERYTHING was on point.

Lee the owner (and I assume chef) was super nice, truly great guy.
Waitress was awesome. Food was awesome, beer was awesome.

I got an amazingly tasty burger that blew my socks off and I eat....an unhealthy about of burgers ;)

Seriously, if you are in town you MUST check this spot out. Great down home, Mom and Pop feel with the quality to make you want to come back again and again!

Thank you Little City Grille!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on our way through town. I can easily say that this place is my new favorite restaurant. From the charming decor to the friendly servers to the huge menu, we really loved it! While we were eating, the tables quickly filled up, and we noticed that the server (perhaps the owner) already knew the \"regular\" orders of the patrons. We were impressed! Thank you! We will come again!"}
{"text":"Good food, coloring books, & fast on the cold drinks! A great lunch spot for multi generation large group and all were happy. Yummy fried pickles! Sandwiches and wraps were good plus a kids menu."}
{"text":"We've lived in Vegas for just a year now, and few things feel like \"home\" yet. But Little City Grill is our place to go when we need to feel like long time locals. We came back the first couple of times because the food was so good and the overall vibe of the place was so welcoming. When great food and genuine service are consistent; you've won me over. *psst* share the crispy French toast for dessert. It's a must."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! While at a convention at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas resort, we drove to this restaurant for dinner. We found that the food was excellent, the people were very hospitable and the town of Boulder City was very friendly. I had their NY Strip steak with mashed potatoes, grilled squash and a side of shrimp linguini. They have a decent selection of beers. For desert we ate chocolate pie. All of this at an affordable price. Our whole group really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Stopped by here super quick yesterday on our way to the Grand Canyon just to grab a breakfast burrito to go and it was AMAZING.  It was so good that we stopped by again today to eat here, I had the same breakfast burrito and my dad switched it up and had their french toast that happens to be breaded with Corn Flakes!  What restaurant does that?! It was brilliant.  The people that work here are extremely nice, warm, and welcoming.  They got me to fall in love with Boulder City.  Definitely stop here if you happen to be in the city!  I know I will."}
{"text":"Food was ok. $6.98 for all kids menu items. $9.95 for a Philly wrap. Probably won't be back ."}
{"text":"Good food, but not worthy of the hype I read elsewhere on Yelp. When I see something rated at 4 1/2 stars, I expect something to wow me. Started with deep fried pickles, which were good. The club was average with a bit much mayo for my preference. My wife had an LA Chicken wrap but the avocado was a bit sparse. Our two small kids split a hot dog and bowl of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was creamy and quite good, probably my favorite out pf everything we ordered. Be warned, there is no children's pricing on drinks, so be prepared to pony up $2.50 per drink even though they will accommodate you with a smaller glass for the young ones. 
  
Again, average eats at a fair price (other than the drinks) with friendly service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem on our way to Hoover Dam. Breakfast all day, delicious food, and decent prices. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"A very inviting and comfortable place to eat with a good menu selection at reasonable prices.  Everyone who works there is super nice and eager to make your dining experience a good one! I had an omelet with cheddar and veggies which was good.  The breakfast potatoes wasn't the same old same old because the potatoes had red and green peppers and onions...those red peppers really make a big difference....Yum!   My husband had a burger, fries and cole slaw. He said everything was very good especially their cole slaw.  We took a piece of raspberry cheesecake to go and was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly very delicious! It is a very small place with a great atmosphere. I would definitely make a stop here every time I visit Vegas. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We finally checked it out on our third day in BC and couldn't be happier. We've had several good meals but this was, hands down, the best. 

The waitress was as sweet as can be and even gave us some hiking trail suggestions. We also had the chance to speak with the chef/owner and he was also extremely nice.

I had the Kobe burger with their house curly fries (and incredible fry sauce) and my wife had the grilled salmon with a house salad.

We almost didn't go in b/c it was 7pm on a Friday and dead.... so glad we did!!!!"}
{"text":"Best hamburger so far. Lovely people in there. Soup is homemade too! A must  to go have a meal there. Friendly environment too."}
{"text":"Good homemade food. If you are leaving Vegas and need to get your life together, this is where it starts. You won't regret it.!"}
{"text":"Grilled salmon was really good .. shrimp Linguine also really good. Small place but good food, good service, and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome food & service. We came in last month with 11 people everyone order something different and everyone bragged about how good it was. We came back this week and the food was excellent again even for my vegan granddaughter. Very cute place highly recommended you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a diner like spot to eat after our visit to Hoover Dam and this popped up. Lots of excellent reviews, but not so sure why?? I had breakfast, eggs, bacon, potatoes and their crunchy French toast. Nothing special about it, eggs were over cooked and bacon was super salty. They charged me $4 just to change my toast to 1 piece of French toast. Kids had hamburgers and fries, very blah. Our waitress was nice. They are super overpriced! Kids meals are $7 and up which only includes soda, no juice or milk. Place looks run down a bit, it's dark and YES they have been on dirty dining. Skip this place! You are not missing anything."}
{"text":"Very small place with a friendly staff. 

Food was just okay and a bit over priced in my opinion. $7 for 5 fried pickle spears that were not anything to write home about. 

The burgers were okay. Server asked what kind of fries we wanted but failed to mention that fries were an additional charge with an up charge if curly or sweet potato fries were selected. This unmentioned/forgotten amount added up to about $10 for us; live and learn. 

The highlight was the house made veggie burger patty. It had actual pieces of veggies in it. 

The restroom out back was surprisingly clean. 

Small patio for outdoor dining behind the parking lot weather permitting."}
{"text":"Tiny cozy place, friendly and accommodating staff. Able to sit our party of 8 + a baby. Most got burgers with curly fries which I recommend vs the traditional. The curly fries tasted like the fries at In and Out, fresh & tasty. The traditional wasn't so great which was what my man got with breaded chicken strips. That was to his liking and juicy. The sweet potato fries were delicious! The steaks which my uncles got looked great! I got the pasta primavera but requested clams so if ended up having a creamy Alfredo sauce. I liked how they were willing to work with all my little needs! We had a salad too with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. My little one got the grilled cheese to her choosing and instead of fries they were kind enough to sub it with fruits- strawberries and banana. They had a station of books/coloring books and crayons to choose from. They had cute little decors all around. We will come here again!"}
{"text":"Small little place on Nevada Way. We arrived before the typical dinner crowd and there was just one other person finishing their meal. 

Jaclyn, our server took our drink orders and provided us with menus. We ordered the pepper jack cheese sticks appetizers and they were delicious. They are served with ranch and house made salsa. My wife knows just how much I love marinara and she asked the server if it was possible to get some and she said it was no problem. 

My wife ordered the steak dinner and it comes with a salad as well, all for $15.00. The salad was fresh and the ranch dressing tastes homemade. I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich with fries.

Our orders arrived in a timely manner and looked delicious! Everything tasted great. A great experience!"}
{"text":"I had a burger and curley fries a few months ago for lunch and it was just OK. Recently took my wife there for dinner since we were in the area. The Philly Cheesesteak was very tasty according to my wife and the curley fries was much better than I remember having, wife loved them and so did I, crispy and flavorful. I had the $9.95 dinner choice of Chicken Cordon Bleu and it was really really good and well prepared. Side of grilled veggies, mashed potato and a side salad was a great value for $9.95. The place is small, but there is usually plenty of seating. Drop in if you are in Boulder City, it's a nice olde fashioned place. Good food, great value!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast!!  I love these cozy little spots.  The service and quality of food was second to none.  I highly recommend this place if you visit the area.  Love the friendly staff and nostalgic atmosphere  and decor.  I can go on and on.  Thanks for the great service guys!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp - a wonderful gem in a small city. My husband got a breakfast wrap and I got a lunch wrap. Both were very fresh and delicious. Waitress was pleasant and upbeat. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"First time here at little City Grille we were driving down to laughlin and decided to eat in Boulder City after going to different eateries we decided to stop at little City Grill the place was almost full we got a spot window view the staff were so friendly and polite the most important the food was so great my wife had a veggie burger and her eyes glowed when she took the first bite and said you got to try this I ordered the mushrooms Swiss burger and the bun was so fresh and soft this place is amazing if your in Boulder City you need to stop by and at this place this became our must stop by if we are in town way to go Little City Grille."}
{"text":"This place was the best! My sister and I stopped in after visiting the Hoover Dam. We thought we would just check out Boulder City and grab a bite to eat somewhere and so glad we stopped here. The staff was amazing, the venue was adorable, and the food was A-ok. I had the southwest chicken sandwich and my sister had the shrimp and clams, both of which were delicious. This review is mostly for the staff-I can't say enough awesome things about our waitress! Would definitely recommend based on service, alone."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here.  The place is pretty dark and you wouldn't even know it was open unless you were familiar.  The fries are a little pricey and not included with burgers. Good service."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food.! The chicken cordon blue is awesome.. we just drive through boulder and we found this place. If you get a chance just stop by..."}
{"text":"Tripping through Boulder City we looked at Yelp and voila' the City Grill popped up first. After being guided into a parking space, we ordered the signature burger...1/3 pound of Kobe beef, sweet potato fries (yum)... Ate out back on the patio.. They even brought our dog a bowl of water. Nice family place."}
{"text":"Stopped up here with my girlfriend for a lunch and train ride. Went further into town and saw that all the power was out so we drove back and saw this little place. The servers were amazingly nice , the food was just as nice. I had the pepper jack cheese sticks and a burger while my other half had a chicken wrap. Curly friends were to die for and the rest of the food followed! Definitely coming back for another round of quality food."}
{"text":"Extremly nice people with awesome food. On our way back to Vegas from camping at Boulder Beach and decided to stop ininj town for lunch. Everyone in the establishment was so friendly. That down home, everyone is family type of vibe. And the food was delicious! Will defintely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service on a busy Black Friday morning. We came in looking for a low key place to eat and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the friendly staff. The corn chowder was delicious, and the breakfast potatoes were a big hit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.. The love the shrimp scampi with pasta. The salads and soups are excellent."}
{"text":"Staff was super nice and fast, the food was really good but a little pricey. Limited seating. Kid friendly. Homey. The one bathroom around the back of the building was kinda weird. Otherwise, cool place."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews. We were starving and this place hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  YUM!  Girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was also very good. Service was good too. All in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. I regret taking my family out to eat here we were all disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  This quaint location has an awesome feel.  The service was super friendly and personable.  Food was excellent and was surprised in a good way when the check came."}
{"text":"The décor and service was fabulous!  The food was tasty, enjoyed the appetizers and tortilla soup.  Portions are on the smaller side but that only means room for dessert!
Loved the Frank Sinatra music."}
{"text":"If I lived here in Vegas I'd be here all the time! I found this gem on Yelp on our way back from a boat ride on Lake Mead with my family who came from all over for a mini family reunion. We had a party of 7 and they greeted us with warm smiles and hospitality.  I love that it's a Mom and Pop diner style place with their awesome daughter Jessie as a amazing server. She really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.The atmosphere is warm and welcome and had a family vibe with cute kitschy photos and decor. I just loved it!!! To start we had delicious Fried Pickles, Mushrooms and Zucchini. The food was perfectly cooked and still had a nice crunch. We all had delicious burgers and a Reuben. The food was SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! I love a great burger and the mushroom Swiss burger I had was phenomenal!!! I'll be sending all my friends in Vegas and those visiting to come visit this wonderful family! Thank you Little City Grille family for treating us like family!  We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Maybe we hit a bad day but our to go order was so bad We couldn't eat it . Medium well in my book does not mean burned at $32 I feel I got burned at both ends"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place!  Food was delicious,  service was wonderful,  restaurant is clean and very nice. We were passing through town on our summer vacation and stopped by based on the reviews-we were not steered wrong!  Everything we ordered was delicious!- shrimp  linguini,  fish and chips (my 7 year old loved them), chicken tenders and the kobe burger (my husband-rough critic-said it was delicious). Every city should have a place like this.  Very good,  very pleasant.  Will definitely come by again any time we are nearby-and on our way back through!"}
{"text":"Boulder City is a great town for hand made burgers at regular prices and the Grill is one of the best! I had a burger with sliced and grilled kielbasa on top, with sautéed mushrooms, onions and mayo-a 10. Also had the Mac and Cheese and it's like Grandma used to make. Craft beers, good wine, great prices and service. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say I love the atmosphere in the cafe. My boyfriend and I were on the way to the Grand Canyon, so I yelped a delicious burger place and this popped up. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger which involved fresh bacon, and two delicious onion rings. All I could think was Wow! My boyfriend had a bowl of chili to start, a mushroom swiss burger with homemade curly fries, and a strawberry milk shake, and let me tell you it was also great! I'm a foodie born and raised in New York, so I was pleased with all the food that passed through my mouth. It was a festival and party in my mouth! Service was great, and if I ever pass through again in boulder City this is my number one spot!"}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us stopped here for brunch on our way to the Hoover Dam from Las Vegas. We had wonderful, friendly and fast service. Food was great! Really cute little cafe."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch after touring Hoover Dam. We both got the Bacon Cheeseburger, which they hand patty daily, it was delicious! Loved the decor, cute, fun place. Great waiter, wish I could remember his name."}
{"text":"Not so much.

For the price you can get much better elsewhere, I would take A&W over this place if I was stuck in BC. The staff is very friendly, but the food just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Last week we decided to rent a car and drive to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. We left the hotel very early and did not have enough time to eat. My friends and I ordered a huge breakfast and enjoyed the food and the (much needed) coffee. The bathroom in the back was clean and well designed. Nice.

Bottom Line: wonderful service, great food. Will definitely stop there again."}
{"text":"Came here on our way to the Hoover Dam for a late breakfast because the line for The Coffee Cup was ridiculous. I'm so glad we found this place on Yelp! It's a cute stand-alone restaurant - small and quaint, but the menu was extensive. The service was super friendly. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area. 

I had the kielbasa breakfast sandwich. Super flavorful and the sourdough bread was grilled to perfection - crispy, but it didn't cut up the roof of my mouth. The breakfast potatoes were delish."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed.   As someone who doesn't think The Cup is all that, this pkace is.  Best burger I have had in years.  My choice was the red/white/blue with lettuce added.  Not happy about pieces of lettuce versus full leaf but fries were fresh and tge meat was perfectly cooked.   I even enjoyed the bun!  My husband enjoyed the Cole sale burger with added jalapeno.   My son,  age 4 LOVED his pancake with sausage.   Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Establishment was clean and well designed."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Any time we are in the area, this is the only place we eat. Their food is delicious, cooked fresh daily (soups and the like), and the server always have a smile to calm your spirits.

This place has a quiet and cozy feel to it and, since it's run by a family, you definitely get a sense of mama's home cookin'.

The experiences we've had here have always been a pleasure. My wife ordered their fresh soup to try it out and they brought two bowls and said, \"This one's on us!\" so we could both enjoy it. The cheese sticks are to die for and their Philly cheese-steak sandwich is amazing!

Stop on by and support a great local restaurant on your way to Hoover Dam!"}
{"text":"Pit stop on the way to Hoover dam when traffic was slammed. We were starving. They had a great gravy steak was awesome definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing restauran! I absolutely love dining here. The bill is always reasonable, the food is always great and the staff is guaranteed to be polite, helpful and respectful giving hreat servixe."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it! Great local diner style spot. We stopped for lunch after visiting the Hoover Dam and were able to snag a spot on the shady patio. The wait staff were welcoming, friendly and wonderful to work with, especially dealing with food allergies in our group. The South of the Border sandwich was delicious, corn flake crusted French toast rich and hearty and the breakfast burritos filling and enormous. We especially loved the dry sauce. All the portions were generous or even large and the prices were very reasonable. Drinks were refilled before we even thought to ask. Our waitress, Randi, was exceptional. We would return again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after reading a few reviews and I absolutely LOVED everything about this place!  People were friendly, food was delicious and everything was just perfect!  Would definitely recommend coming by!"}
{"text":"Great authentic little place with a great menu - delicious burger - SUPER nice service. Perfect stop on a hot day mid-vacation. Barely 10 min from Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered a wrap, me, the south of the border, her the LA wrap. We both took a bite and looked at each other like, what the heck. It was the most flavorless, disgusting thing ever. It was basically like eating a head of iceberg lettuce, and plain chicken. 

I tried a second bite, but couldn't do it. I ended up eating sweet potato fries.  You would think the waitress would say something seeing that I left an entire wrap untouched, but I'm assuming she knew how horrible it was."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great smiles.  Green Chili burger was phenomenal with exceptional sweet potato fries!! Great side stop while at Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Stopped at this quaint little place and it was amazing. Food and service are second to none. Very reasonably price."}
{"text":"The Little City Diner is full of BIG tastes. My wife and I came in for lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Apparently we were not the only people to think of the idea. The little in little city is very literal. All the tables were taken except one and while the seemed full it wasn't uncomfortable. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak wrap which came out as a sandwich which was easy enough to deal with. The sandwich was very tasty and as bonus since I can't eat fries they sent out a great little salad instead. My wife ate the French dip sandwich which she loved. Overall food was great and the service better."}
{"text":"Quaint little diner in the historical district. Very humble and homely atmosphere that is powered by friendly faces and strong kitchen. 4 of us had just finished a weekend in Las Vegas and were starting our drive home to Phoenix, AZ. We found this place and I'm glad I did. 2 of my friends ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and I ordered the flapjacks with a side of eggs along with bacon. Amazing breakfast food. Simple, straight to the point and efficient. I would certainly recommend this place to everyone and indeed eat here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff and amazing food. Everyone was so friendly. The atmosphere was like having breakfast with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Won't be eating here! It's bad enough they are repeat health dept offenders, but the man's behavior toward news crew...totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Little City Grille

A great place to stop on your way to the Hoover Dam.

Ambiance: Quaint.  Reminds me of the great little restaurants in San Francisco.

Nice selection.  The Crispy French Toast is excellent!!!  I had the Big Daddy breakfast sandwich which was excellent as well.  Hubby had an omelette."}
{"text":"Very earnest little place. Lots of care into food and decor. Excellent homemade corned beef hash for breakfast. Partner happy with kielbasa sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by on way to Scottsdale and had the best breakfast- chicken fried steak and eggs. My wife had the Veggie omelet which was awesome too!  Nice local diner with great food and quick service"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam.  Atmosphere was great....small and intimate.  The pepper jack cheese sticks were delicious and the salsa that came with it was also very good.  Had the Kobe burger, ordered medium, but came a little well done.  Still very good.  good prices and portions.  Was hoping for cake pops as mentioned in previous posts, but they didn't have any.  Would like to try for breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"So many pleasant surprises here! The veggie hamburger was awesome (my girlfriend took it even further by adding an egg). The bread pudding was like nothing I've ever tried. (Lemon, and with a bread texture that was amazing).

And I agree with other reviewers -- Brandi was an awesome waitress.

It was also a nice place to get out of the 114-degree heat ... :-)

If I begged, would you give me the bread pudding recipe?"}
{"text":"I go to Little City Grill weekly and for the most part this eating establishment is such an Awesome place to eat and take your family. The employees and the owner/manager have such Excellent customer service they make you feel at home. Their food is Really Good, I like the Bacon Burger and the Fry Sauce is the Best In Town!!"}
{"text":"Whoa! What a fun surprise. Just looking for a place to grab some breakfast heading to the dam from Vegas. What a fun, distinctive place with excellent and warm service and good hand made food.  Who knew you could get a biscuit this good outside of Alabama. This is the corned beef hash special."}
{"text":"I worked in Boulder City for 7 years and never tried this place. Today I find I wasn't missing out on anything. Took the family for lunch. Walking in it seemed a cozy little place where the locals go to talk about their day with about 10 tables. We sat and waited for menus. A lady came over with them and asked us if we would like anything to drink. Ordered water at first. While she went to get our water I found a beer I wanted to try so I waited for her to come back with the water. She returned and I asked for the beer, she says \" your waitress will be with you in a moment.\" Odd considering she was just there to take a drink order. So we looked over the menu and waited 10 minutes for the waitress. We ordered. Kids got breakfast and my girl got the Veggie burger with soup. I ordered a Philly Wrap which was described as \" brimming with roast beef with mushrooms, peppers and steam melted cheese.\" I also ordered the beer. The beer came and we sat and talked for another 10 minutes when the waitress came back and my girl asked for her soup. I guess it's not normal for them to serve it right away. It was Minestrone and flavorful but lukewarm at best. 10 minutes later the food came and looked good except for all the lettuce on the Philly Wrap and the soggy curly fries. Who puts lettuce on a Philly Wrap and doesn't put it in the description on the menu which should have read \"brimming with lettuce\". I was too hungry to send it back and find something else so I picked the lettuce out. My girls burger arrived with more lukewarm soup. Uggh. At least the breakfast looked good. Kids gobbled it up. Waitress doesn't come around very often and a waiter showed up out of nowhere filling our water. We finished our lunch and I had to ask the gentleman to find my waitress for me so I could get the bill, asked him about the lettuce on the wrap and was told that they always put in on there. I explained that it should have been on the menu, which I wouldn't have ordered it. He was very dismissive about it. He took our card and off he went. A couple minutes later the waitress appeared with the bill and no card. Hilarious. Obviously got the minimum tip. We told her about the wrap and the man we talked to who she described as the \"owner\". Pretty sad. Needless to say we will not he back. Ever. Service was bad and the food was subpar. At least the beer was decent. I'm guessing most reviews are from the tourists that pass through town and don't know their options which is sad. I can think of at least 10 better places to eat in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant to stop at before a long drive home.  Everyone was so friendly, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience. The food was outstanding and the waitress spectacular. I look forward to visiting this place again in the future. Everything tasted very fresh and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall find. The crunchy french toast is amazing. The biscuits and gravy is different. It has a smokey taste to it. There's a small outside patio and a dozen tables inside. Service was prompt and everyone was friendly. There's a few parking spaces around back. The bathroom is outback. It's just one bathroom, so it's co-ed. If you're in Boulder City, give it a try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some down-home good cooking an excellent food this is your place! I rarely if ever take the time to write a review. But this place is phenomenal! I highly suggest stopping by. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, kids had French Toast (was delicious), wife and I each ordered the LA wrap (also very good). The LA wrap can definitely be split."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the Hoover Dam.  Looks like a complete dive from the outside.  Food was good,  nothing extraordinary but no complaints.   We had the Philly steak,  LA wrap and shrimp.  Staff was very nice and appreciative,  would cone back if in the area."}
{"text":"We picked this little (haha) place by looking on Yelp and very happy we did! It's charming and has a good menu. Had the LA wrap with homemade curly fries and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time eating outdoors before the art festival. The food was tasty and it was a perfect venue for my kiddos. Staff was very sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite after hiking at lake Mead. Super cute, quaint and homey inside, friendly staff and efficient service. I got the bbq chicken salad which was delicious and super fresh tasting. Would come back here again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are high-quality and the sweet potato fries are delicious.

The grilled mushrooms and Swiss cheese are what makes the burgers stand out from other places. The burger sizes are just perfect and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love when I find the perfect little restaurants,  Such a friendly staff!  Good food, good wine great little atmosphere. Great get outta town and try kinda place. Yumm"}
{"text":"This has become our 'go to' spot whenever we come to Boulder City for a car show. We have even brought family here. They have excellent malts, and great burgers. The interior is not what you would expect from the outside. It is intimate inside, and charming. 

We have had the chili, burgers, curly fries, sandwiches and malts. The employees are very friendly, and service is always with a smile. The chef served our burger last time...chef coat and all! Food here is always pretty good. We will for sure be coming back when the next car show is in town."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt our best breakfast on our trip. Nice little hole in the wall feel to it with great food and friendly staff.  Menu had some unique items as well as standard fare. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Stopped in with family for an early dinner while taking a break from Vegas. They have a great kids menu with a very good variety. Enough choices to satisfy the kiddos without overwhelming them with too many. They were very happy with the ground steak, chicken fingers and the awesome grilled cheese. The kids loved the variety of fries  offered, being the great french fry connoisseurs that they are. My Mom had wonderful huge bowl of clam chowder that was so creamy and delicious. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was to die for-absolutely magnificent. My NY strip was very yummy, cooked to a perfect medium rare. The restaurant is a very small and quaint. It was very interesting to me that they had a drive thru pickup window. I love that! I'm not a fast food/chain restaurant food lover so places that have great food that you can pick up and take with you are a huge bonus. One thing I haven't mentioned was the person that made the experience exceptional was the waitress Jacklyn. She was very friendly and attentive. She was great with the kids, didn't even wince when we walked in with four in tow. She was very good talking to them instead of over them. She was a hit with our lemonade lovers when she offered to make them strawberry and cherry infused drinks. Very good waitress. If you are in Boulder City, this is a wonderful place to dine. Can't wait to see how they do breakfast."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Great food, great service, nice decor. You know somebody cares about this place the minute you walk inside."}
{"text":"This little place is great and a total Hidden gem. We came here after going to a miserable fail of a restaurant. Having never been here before we were greatly surprised. 

This is this place that used to be the southwest diner, but now it is been transformed in the something much better.

The prices are reasonable, the portions are large, the atmosphere is cute and quaint, the staff was extremely friendly, and the food was delicious. I had the LA chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and I wouldn't order anything else on the menu.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone stopping by Boulder city or to any of the local people here. This place will definitely make it for the long run."}
{"text":"We just had the best lunch! The server anticipated what we needed before we needed it! I thought she was an owner she took such care with us. The ambiance was fun and interesting with quotes and pictures that made for good conversation starters with our family. The food was abundant, well priced and not greasy! Even the fries and popcorn shrimp tasted clean some how. From start to the finish which included chocolate kisses with the bill we had an enchanted lunch, with classic jazz music and relaxed atmosphere!! 5 star diner experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome little diner in Boulder City. Found it on yelp after a day at the lake. Don't miss this gem.  Our server (Rave) knows the menu, is helpful, attentive and makes a mean milk shake and malt. Chef Bob treated us to the BEST ever:  philly steak sandwich, crispy chicken wrap, 12\" chili cheese dog, and club sandwich.  

All breads are fresh from a local bakery (yes that makes a difference). Fries are fresh cut to order. Specialty sauces and dips are tasty as well. 

Daughter was treated to a surprise tasting of their fabulous French toast - omg - delicious!

Wish we lived closer, but will definitely make the drive to Little City Grille whenever we're in Vegas. Yes, it's worth the drive 

Bathroom 'around back?' Yeah, no biggie. Steps from the door and clean. Apparently LCG was a burger drive thru in another life. 

Go.eat.enjoy !!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after visiting the Hoover dam. It was fantastic!! Great service - delicious homemade curly fries and ranch. We all had chicken wraps which were very good as well. Excellent break from the strip"}
{"text":"Best Rueben ever!!! And I've eaten a ton of Ruebens in my day. The wife had a chicken wrap and I took a bite and it was amazing too! Waitress Jessie as good as they come, young and a sweetheart you won't be able to keep from giving her a double tip, she's that sweet. Owner/chef came out and chatted and you can see why this little place is so outstanding. I'd give it ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"I step back in time.  I couldn't pass this place by. A one time ice cream parlor transformed into mom and pop restaurant, maintaining the old time atmosphere.  The owner came out of the kitchen and talked with us for a few minutes and the staff was as friendly as could be.  I had the green chili burger and fries and it was excellent.  I will be back next year to visit these wonderful people."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a trip from Sedona to Vegas based on reviews. Met expectations. I had fish and chips. Companion had clam strips. Both had golden brown breading, tender and flaky fish. I would return"}
{"text":"I'd give 10 stars if I could! Excellent service, AMAZING food!!!!
Appetizer sampler to die for!
Red white and bleu burger- best burger I've ever had!!!
Fish and chips definitely run with the best of em!!
Gonna come here ever year during MATS!!!
Oh! And prices are perfect!!
Thanks little city grille!"}
{"text":"We had the signature Kobe hamburgers they were very very good sweet potato fries and regular fries both awesome and the staff was very very nice facilities are clean recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after visiting the dam. Super friendly and attentive service. Delicious home made ranch and fry sauce. Everything was fresh and tasty.  Good portions and reasonable prices. We were so happy to have good food and support this local business. Highly recommend you stop in this place if you're passing through, the town is charming."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I'm so glad we just happened upon it.  The service was great, the food was delicious, and the prices were incredibly reasonable."}
{"text":"Visiting from the chilly East coast.Spent the morning at the Hoover Dam.We went on to Yelp,and you steered us in the right direction.If you want a great meal,nice people, this the place to go! Philly Steak sandwich with a side of nice creamy cheddar mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Great service and food was awesome. We had the spicy tuna melt and the reuban and were extremely satisfied. Reasonably priced, would definately recommend and woukd love to have this restaurant at home. Terrific!"}
{"text":"Stop looking and eat here! Great food with a down home feel. 

The bacon Bleu burger was amazing! The bun was super soft but toasted, the meat was cooked very nicely, bacon nice and crispy and they did not skip on the bleu cheese! The homemade curly fries were sooo tasty! 

On top of that the staff and the owner Lee were very very sweet and helpful, very quick service, can't say a bad word about them."}
{"text":"It was good, nothing to dislike. I had the Chicken fried steak breakfast, the gravy was unique and quality."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise for us. We left Las Vegas early to get out to the Grand Canyon, but did not want to deal with the crowds to eat there. Yelp came through with this little gem on our way. It is small. There is a parking lot out behind it. This is the old time local diner some still remember. The food is affordable, and you get a lot for your money.

I ordered a breakfast burrito. It was large, and tasty. It was stuffed with yummy goodness, eggs, sausage, etc. The coffee was also spot on. Our server was very friendly and helpful.

I had to small issues. One, the bathrooms are accessed from the outside. Not a deal breaker, but worth noting. Also, there was only one server and she was hustling to keep up. She did her best, but the service was consequently slower than I would have liked.

All that being said, it is still a great spot. Take the time to check it out."}
{"text":"We are glad to have stopped here for a late lunch. The burgers were great and the sweet potato fries were fantastic. The homemade strawberry lemonade was tasty and hit the spot. Service (lovely lady with short dark hair) was fast and friendly. Superb. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Our family was heading from Hoover Dam back to Vegas and needed some lunch.  This place did not disappoint.  I had the L.A. wrap with chicken and avocado.  It was delicious.  My wife got a bacon burger.  As good as my wrap was, I wish I ordered the burger instead.  Honestly, It was one of the best burgers I ever tasted in my life.  Crinkle fries were very good and light.  My daughter got chicken strips and fries and she loved it.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The place was recently renovated and was very light and airy.  I'm sure the breakfast and dinner are equally as good, but if you want a good place for lunch I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another Hidden Gem of Boulder City. Here we have a true Mom and Pop Shop with every kind of comfort food you can imagine. I hear they have a mezzanine for people to throw things like birthday parties and weddings towards the back of their property. I was just passing through and I found this place on Yelp so I thought I would do my best to Yelp this place as well. I had the fried zucchini and it was out of this world. Please stop here and support small business."}
{"text":"The food served here tastes very good. The service is very polite. However, it took forever for us to get our food. The restaurant was only half full; so based on this, I'm thinking you shouldn't be in a rush when you come here for a meal."}
{"text":"We were on our way back to Vegas from the Grand Canyon skywalk and starving so gave this cute little diner a try. Amazing philly cheese steak and great fries. Super happy we stopped :)"}
{"text":"Awesome piece of Americana. Great service and food at a reasonable price. I had their home-made veggie burger. It was the best veggie burger I ever tasted. I'm glad I drove outside of Vegas to find this great little diner."}
{"text":"Pros: nice atmosphere; Quick service;
Very clean and it had a steady flow of people walking in.
Cons: 
-do not order fish and chips. The batter is thick without seasoning and only tasted like fried oil. 
- They do NOT care for feedback and if you leave a plate untouched, no one will care to ask why. 
- Burgers are ok, not the best as the patty lacks seasoning but they are presented well and if yours as enough extra stuff in it you might have a better experience than I did. 
- expensive for the quality of what you get.i"}
{"text":"Went to this family-run eatery for lunch today.  Obvious from the people eating in the restaurant that it is a local favorite, for obvious reasons.  Hamburgers and omelets.  The hamburgers were delicious and huge.  The omelets were flavorful and satisfying.  The service was exceptional and friendly and prompt.  We certainly will be back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"We saw the reviews on yelp and decided to try it.  We were not disappointed. Veggie burger is delicious and atmosphere is great. Music is from the 30s and 40s. Quaint place.  Server was great and went out of his way to tell us where to find the best grocery store.  Limited wine list but good wines.  If your in Boulder city  and looking for something different than the bar scene stop here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Come on people , they are all over the news for how dirty their kitchen is , channel 13 \"dirty dining\" they come out TWICE .. GROSSS"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.  We enjoyed our meal and were impressed by the food and service.  A definite recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little place, personable waitresses, calm atmosphere, food has been great both times we've been here. Can't really ask for more! My fiance and I will be continuing to visit when we are back in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're visiting the Hoover Dam or in the area.  Super friendly staff and good selection on the menu.  Got a Red, White, & blue burger which was very tasty.  The zucchini planks were great too especially with ranch dressing.  They serve beer & wine also.  The bathroom was very clean.  The atmosphere is cozy and decorated nicely."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise. We came for the highly recommended Vegetarian burger my daughter wanted but I will come back for the steak the service and the atmosphere.  Amazing people and great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific food and service. Pet friendly patio - super cute atmosphere. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Just WOW! So easy to find, but the service is only outdone by the food! 

The world famous French toast, the locally sourced sausage & the glorious omelettes made to your flavour list were truly the best way to start our day! 

The line up & seats outside attest it's not just my opinion... never ending coffee, fun, smiley & efficient team members made it feel like you were at your best friends place for a meal... if your friends REALLY know how to prep a plate!!!

Check these guys out; you'll be glad you did!!!!"}
{"text":"3 & 1/2 STARS

   Little City Grille is small on size but big on charm. It is a small mom & pop diner off Nevada Way where the road transitions from a strip of motels into the Boulder City Central Business District. 

   I had been to Little City Grille two times before hiking adventures near Boulder City. The first time was last Memorial Day and the second was the day before yesterday on Earth Day. 

  As soon as I stepped inside the diminutive mom & pop shop, it was a leap back in time. Throughout the room there are pictures and memorbelia of Boulder City and humorous sayings. The most memorable is a picture that says \"Welcome friends\" on the wall. Everywhere my eyes roamed I'd take in pictures of Boulder City. For the most part my eyes would roam on the menu and table. By the way, every table features pictures of Boulder City residents. 

   When I looked at the menu, I observed that the prices are not reflective of another era. The majority of the breakfast and lunch plates cost over $8. The cup of coffee was near $3. Breakfast Specials were nonexistent. 

   When I dined here on Memorial Day 2015, I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger with fries. I wasn't crazy over both the burger and fries. Time passed by and I delayed writing this review. Fast forward to Earth Day 2016, and I returned here for a pre-hiking breakfast. 

    On this weekday morning it is was far less busy than Memorial Day last year. This created a cozy breakfast setting. I was at ease walking around looking at the pictures. My waitress and possibly an owner was warm and would check up on me. As soon as I walked inside, Gina told me to sit anywhere. I passed over sitting at the counter where I could see them make the food. I passed over sitting on the patio overlooking Nevada Way. I walked a few feet to a comfortable booth surrounded by pictures, model cars, and memorbelia. One of the pictures was the password for the Internet. My attentive waitress would point out that they were all caps. I would point out that I wanted the BLT ($6.95). Gina would point out that they only had the breakfast potatoes instead of what normally comes with it. I was thinking to myself that the regular fries were nothing to write home about. However, the breakfast potatoes were something to write home about. They were outstanding! The delectable seasoning complimented the potatoes, onions, and peppers. Ultimately the breakfast potatoes complimented the BLT that I personally requested a lot of mayonnaise on. The nice thing about tiny restaurants is that when you realize that you realize you forgot to tell the waitress about adding a lot of mayonnaise, she is a few steps away. 

  The BLT with mayonnaise is more than comfort food. I also use it as a bellwether of quality. I was so much more impressed with their BLT than the mushroom Swiss burger. The sandwich was loaded with bacon, fresh tomatoes and mayonnaise then topped with mayonnaise. Good stuff! 

  The $3 bottomless coffee was also good. If I had drunk enough of it to the point of needing to visit the rest room, it would be necessary to leave the restaurant. The restroom is in back of the building. 

  Gina did not rush me. When I was finished eating the food she left me with the check and a Hershey Kiss. The Hershey Kiss next to the check was a cute touch that leaves a last impression that Little City Grille is a mom and pop restaurant small on size but big on charm."}
{"text":"I loved the food at Little City Grill. I especially enjoyed the chicken parm. Well done! Dessert was great too! Jaclyn is very professional and friendly. Your waiters and waitresses truly enhanced my dining experience. I definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Boulder City. Oh, did I mention that the restaurant has charming interior decor?"}
{"text":"Cool little place, looks like an old Dairy Queen Bldg. Fun decor and friendly and efficient service. We came in for breakfast and I've found them to be pretty pricey. $2.85 for iced tea, $11.50 for 3 slices of French toast and $4.00 side of bacon is more like NYC pricing. It took a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen but everything looked very good and tasted very good. Overall I'd have to say the food and service were very good but I didn't find it to be a good value."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the BEST burgers I've ever eaten! Gina (with an I ) was or server, she is awesome! prices were very reasonable. If you are hungry this is a MUST stop."}
{"text":"Love their veggie burgers and sweet potato fries. Had a long lunch with a friend here recently, and the server was as sweet as could be and did not rush us. I've been here a few times now and have always enjoyed the food and service. My only gripe is that at certain times, the sun really blazes in through the windows, though they'll do their best to make you comfortable. I also appreciate that they take pains to make it much nicer than most restaurants in its price category - tablecloths, etc. I don't know why one Yelper called this a greasy spoon!! Wrong-o. Just a sweet diner with a touch of class."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place for a meal. My parents have lived in Boulder City for 8 years yet have never dined here until last night. We celebrated their 73rd birthdays and we had a great time. You can get breakfast, lunch or dinner during the dinner hour. 

We started with a glass of wine and beer and shared the sample appetizer of fried cheese, zucchini, pickles and mushrooms. All very good but the mushrooms out of this world. All hand breaded!  Hubby had the chicken noodle soup instead of a salad . Wow. Reminded me of the great soup my grandma used to make. 

Good service, albeit a bit slow. Friendly staff and great food!

For dinner we had the Reuben (highly recommend), chicken fried steak (good) and the chicken cordon blue (highly recommend).  They use marbled eye for the Reuben and the meat, sauerkraut and sauce was in the correct ratio!

They brought us a piece of chocolate bundt cake to share for dessert. The owner/chef came out during our meal to ask if we enjoyed it. He then played a small wind up gizmo that played happy birthday!  It was accompanied by candles. Great way to end the evening! 

My parents really enjoy their meal and said they will be back soon. We will as well on our next visit to Boulder City!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little diner type of place for Boulder. The food was good and the wait staff was pretty attentive. Went in for breakfast with the folks today and we all had about 4 cups of coffee each, never saw the bottom of my cup, a classic yardstick for excellence among diners. We had chicken fried steak, a Denver scramble, and eggs and ham steak. They were all very good. The best thing is the potatoes though, truly excellent. Definitely will be back to try the french toast with the corn flakes, sounds good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and this place does not disappoint. 

My husband had the Mac and Cheese and the portion could've been bigger, but it was delicious. The cheese sauce could've been a bit thicker, also.

I had the Red, White, and Bleu burger. It's a burger with bacon, ranch, and Bleu cheese crumbles. So yummy! 

The best thing was the deep fried spicy pickle spears! The batter was delicious and the pickles were just a bit spicy (I would've been happy with spicier). We also had the clam strips which were so good! 

All in all this place is definitely a place we would return to. Small town feeling with delicious options."}
{"text":"Wow! I am in love with this place. The food alone was great, but there's atmosphere here. There's a true love and positivity here. I didn't want to leave.

The place is cozy. I sat at the counter and was immediately greeted by Brandi although Brandy was my server, Jessie was great to talk to and helped serve me. It was like having two servers. They genuinely seemed to enjoy talking to me and enjoy their jobs and each other.

Then I noticed the decor. Warm colors on the wall, nicely decorated, not too sparse, not too much, and all positivity. Positive phrases like \"You're never too old to set another dream or dream a new dream.\" or \"Some people look for a beautiful place. Others make a place beautiful.\" I believe they live by these messages.

I had to comment on the music. They don't play whatever is on the radio. They're selection was positive, warm and up beat. Some mix or Nora Jones and Colby Caliat. The sound...the owner here is somewhat of an audiophile as am I. I spotted a pair of pioneer tower speakers and could hear the soothing  rumble of a woofer. I felt like I was listening to music in my own living room.

The food was great, but I enamored with the place before it came. I had the omlet special. It was great and looked great on the plate. The soft drinks were perfectly carbonated and refilled promptly. I never saw the bottom of my cup.

Of my whole trip to Las Vegas, the price was the most reasonable I've had. My meal and drink we're about $13.00 without the tip. I paid $24 for a drink at the Mirage. 

If I could give 6 stars, I would. I am naturally a cynical person, but I left feeling positively loved with a smile on my face. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food 5 Stars 
Service 5 Stars 
We were looking & looking for an interesting place to have lunch,  found this little gem &  hit a home run!  Recommend the Kobe beef burger or BBQ chopped chicken salad.  The homemade coleslaw is a must have side!"}
{"text":"My wife and I chose this restaurant for dinner while spending the night in Boulder City. This is a really nice spot with a very friendly and attentive staff. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day which is really cool. My wife ordered off the dinner portion of the menu and I ordered their veggie burger from the lunch menu. My wife's blackened salmon was delicious, and the very accommodating staff happily substituted fettuccine with marinara for the mashed potatoes at my wife's request. My veggie burger is listed as a specialty on the menu and was completely homemade with numerous veggies incorporated into it. One of the best I've ever had. My wife also ordered a cup of clam chowder which was very good, and while I was waiting soupless, our server very kindly brought me a complementary cup of their homemade lentil soup just so I wouldn't be sitting there with nothing to do. It was really delicious. If you find yourself staying in Boulder City, Nevada or just passing through and looking for a bite to eat this is the place to go. The staff, ambience, and food were all beyond our expectations."}
{"text":"Do breakfast or lunch here at least once a week. Good, tasty with great service. Menu is pretty diverse with a focus on basics with a twist. Real diner feel with better food. Love the sandwiches and wife loves the wraps. One of BC's jems that make the town unique."}
{"text":"Food was great and very friendly service! Loved the mom and pop feel but with delish food too. Highly recommend and you have to get the planked zucchini to start."}
{"text":"Stopped by primarily on previous Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. Great little place with v good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Touristy reviews. I may be a little critical cause I KNOW THE GOOD PLACES TO EAT.  VEGAS BOULDER CITY AREA SINCE 1993. this is NOT one of them.  
Not a 5 star nor a 4. Very typical dinner food. Heavy cream. Salt and grease. COMFORT FOOD YES! I was pleasantly surprised at the veggie burger. But 9 bucks? Please!
Owner was very dismissive when it was brought to his attention that the Philly wrap WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED on the menu. His exact words were \"next time we'll fix that for you\" and walked away."}
{"text":"Very good food, special the burgers 
And have a great service, a must if you go to the out side of Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I always hope to find while traveling, genuine small business, caters to locals and travelers alike, and delivers what they promise. We arrived on new years day after visiting the hoover dam and the place was pretty swamped around 6pm. We waited maybe 5 minutes for a table to open, ordered some drinks, and flipped through the menu. We gave our orders, but were told they were pretty swamped so it would be a few minutes. Lee the owner came around and asked how everything was. He sensed we had been waiting and rushed out another beer and the soup that came with the dinners (clam chowder, delicious). I had the shrimp linguini and she had the fried clam and shrimp basket. My portion wasn't overly large, but I could tell it was certainly fresh made, hers was good to (especially the Cole slaw side). We chatted with Lee a bit more before we left and will probably call in an order in the morning to pick up en route to the grand canyon tomorrow.

Definitely give this place a look and support with your patronage if you're ever around Boulder City."}
{"text":"The curly fries will kill your diet, but soooooo worth it.
I've driven by this place many many times.  So glad I finally stopped there for lunch.
Service was fast and friendly.  Food was good.  Fresh, good quality ingredients, yummy. Prices not bad.
One of the things that I really liked about the place was the counter seating.  Not many seats - about 5.  But as someone who sometimes dines alone, I am so much more comfortable sitting at a counter than taking up a whole table.
Next time I'm going for dinner. 
I saw they had homemade mac & cheese on the menu.
The Diet Dies Again."}
{"text":"First time my wife and I stop by this place. It's very nice and clean inside. Our server was really nice and attentive. I ordered the 'Big Daddy Sandwich' for breakfast. The sandwich was amazing really. Eggs, cheese, bacon, & grilled onions on sourdough bread. Very delicious and filling. My wife got French toast and she was very happy with her order. Will be coming here again when in town."}
{"text":"Never got to eat here. Waited an hour for food and nothing ever showed up. The whole restaurant cleared out and still nothing."}
{"text":"Little restaurant in Bolder City. I discovered this restaurant throw Yelp and it got very good reviews. I order the egg burger that included their home made sauce. I enjoyed my my food and would go back if I lived in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I had french toast on the brain. Or was it the stomach? Either way, my husband and I were passing through Boulder City on our way back to Arizona when I saw an old sign in the shape of an ice cream cone. A bright red building below it caught my eye so I told my husband we should stop there. As we pulled through the parking lot I notice the employee entrance had black bold letters on it in a fun font that read \"Culinary creations behind this door\". This place had a great vibe already. We were warmly welcomed and invited to sit where ever we'd like. This place was pretty much full, but it was pleasant. We sat at the quaint little counter and given menu's. Amanda took care of us during our visit although both my husband and I noticed how well the whole crew worked together as a team. It's a small building that apparently used to be the \"Frostee Freeze\" so we had a front row seat to everything happening inside. At one point the \"Culinary creator\" came out to deliver a plate and then added some great music. 

Now, the food. Absolutely delicious home cooking. No it was no 5 star fancy cuisine, but that's not what we were in the market for. We wanted REAL food with great flavor.  That's what we got. Little City Grille had the exact french toast I was craving. Battered and grilled dusted in cornflakes to give a nice crunch on the outside. The syrup was not overly-sweet either. I also ordered one scrambled egg and a half order of bacon. On my plate was one REAL egg and two slices of perfectly cooked, thick, smoked bacon, and it was not drenched in grease. This combination was perfect for me. I prefer fairly salted bacon to pair with my scrambled egg instead of seasoning the egg. My husband had the french toast as well and devoured the entire 3 slices! He had the breakfast potatoes which were similar to an O'brien with diced bell pepper and onion. I did not taste it, but visually it was obvious the veggies were real and not frozen. Major bonus. His ham was also cooked perfectly. 

Delicious food, uplifting vibe, pleasant people and heart felt service. Stopping at Little City Grille was the perfect choice to send us merrily on the road again."}
{"text":"Came in too Little City Grill today! Tasted the best juicy juicy hamburger  I have ever tasted! Fries were  nice and crispy ! Yummm! Brenda our waitress was very accompanying and very friendly! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Little City Grille serves a delicious breakfast and our waitress was awesome! The eggs were perfect, the bacon just the way I ordered it, and their potatoes are amazing. Plus, Boulder City is a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Small little place, big on flavor. We would definitely come back next time in Vegas.  Service was great and really stayed on top of drink refills and checking on us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It is a family owned and operated restaurant and they couldn't be a nicer bunch of people. The decor is very charming and welcoming. My husband said the grilled salmon was the best he's ever had. The zucchini planks are amazing. Everything was done perfectly. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Best Sweet Potato fries ever.  At lunch on the way back to Vegas from Hoover Dam. Worth the trip through Historic Boulder City."}
{"text":"I had the pork chop and my husband had the cordon bleu. It was good home made food!  Also the salad and the veggies were fresh and well cooked, it was nice! I also really like the decor and enjoyed to read all the quotes everywhere. And our waitress was lovely. Definitely a place to check!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe we wasted a meal at this place. Yelp let us down! How can it possibly have 4 1/2 stars when the food is so bad?

I ordered the fish and chips. Surely no-one can screw that up? And yet they did. The batter was soggy and under-cooked, the fries were barely cooked enough.

I asked the waitress to have my fish cooked again and I think the cook decided to teach me a lesson. If I can figure out how to add a photo I'll post the one I took of the burnt fish.

I would never go back to this place and I cannot understand how so many people think it's good. Hubby's food wasn't as bad as mine, hence 2 stars instead of just one."}
{"text":"Great place for the trek home from Vegas! Service is stellar and food is incredible! We got the chicken fried steak and the French toast both were amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Hoover Dam.  On our way back I checked Yelp for suggestions for lunch. We stopped at Little City Grille. The LA chicken wrap was delicious and filling. My family had crispy chicken wrap protein style, the philly steak, and a chicken salad. My mother who is a picky eater was so surprised at how delicious the food is. If we lived closer this would be our favorite restaurant!!!  Great staff and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great cozy restaurant with amazing employees. Their shrimp pasta is do die for! I ordered a corona they brought it over in a frozen mug which made my beer 10x better. Will definitely be stopping here if im ever in Boulder City, NV again. LOL"}
{"text":"Cute place I wouldn't mind stopping by again after visiting Hoover Dam, seriously a little town grill with a cozy atomosphere with attentive service. The food is good but not great and makes for a filling meal.

One recommendation I have is to not get the steak dish at the moment, the one I got \"medium rare\" was definitely closer to \"well done\" and could use improvement. The french onion was good but the mashed potatoes' gravy was a little too smoky tasting for me. Just a reminder if you are planning to get a wrap that they are massive and expect to share or bring some home with you. 

Honest review 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always good. I love the vegi burger and sweet potato fries. Worth the trip there. My #1 place to go in Boulder."}
{"text":"5 stars times two .. Really great service .. Gggreat cccoffee   !!!!!  Food yummy  on steroids  !"}
{"text":"Hungry after a trip to Hoover Dam we searched on Yelp and found this small cafe.  I'm so glad we did.  My entire family loved the experience -- the food, the service, the atmosphere, etc.  My husby got the 9 lb Reuben with curly fries - YUM!  I had the grilled chicken/avocado wrap with curly fries - FRESH and YUM!  My kids ate their meals without hesitation.  They enjoyed the crinkle-cut fries, but I would recommend the curly fries over their crinkle-cut fries.  We ended our meal with malts made from an ice cream machine that was 60 years old.  The small malt is plenty, as all their portion sizes are generous.  Service was top notch and friendly.  We ate at restaurants in Vegas of \"James Beard Award-Winning Chefs\", but this little place left the greatest impression on us.  Sometimes simple (done well) is better.  When our trip was said and done my husby, also a chef, wanted to go out of our way to eat here again.  What a pleasant surprise and experience!!"}
{"text":"Driving back from a weekend trip to vegas, not feeling fast food. We were just looking a diner to get good food to nourish our bodies for the drive..yelped places nearby and stopped in to grab a bite. This place is a gem, from the moment you walk it..the building is adorable, all of the staff are welcoming and sweet. The food is top notch. Everyone at table agrees, best meal of thw whole weekend. A must stop from now on when travelling by. As my fiance said \"he will crave this place, and thinking about the the delicious food\""}
{"text":"Best veggie breakfast wrap ever. Fresh ingredients, served hot, grilled just right. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The staff were so friendly. I have a gluten allergy and they were very accommodating, they even double checked the ingredients before they made the food. I had the BBQ Chicken Salad... so yummy! My husband had the foot long hotdog and fries (he does not have an allergy). He said it was one of the best foot longs he has had.  Cute decor, cozy family feel. We will definitely be checking this place out again when we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"On our way home from the Hoover Dam and stumbled across this restaurant. Our servers name was Gina. She was absolutely incredible! She was extremely personable and checked up on us very frequently. The Kobe burger and LA Chicken wraps were out of this world as well as the sampler appetizer playger! Amazing experience, will definitely go back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Found this one place on a drive while on vacation. It was quaint the people were so friendly food was amazing and the decorations were kitschy! Absolutely loved this place!!"}
{"text":"Cute little oasis in the desert!  Great food and service. Loved the veggie burger and shakes!

And fun decor for discussion, makes an entertaining destination."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     35/100

I had no idea this place existed till my cousin's girlfriend and I scanned yelp in Boulder City and she suggested we try out this place, and I'm so glad she did! 

It was a serendipitous lunch adventure with my family because they're resistant to try new restaurants. With that said, we ALL LOVE this place! Sorry Pizza Hut, but this may be our new spot while we're in Boulder City. 

Small yet charming place, with home cooked meals and fresh ingredients. Another thing I love about this place is the decor. They have inspirational quotes posted throughout the restaurant and restrooms. 

It was so hard to choose what to eat, because they had so many unique choices, plus they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. 

Our dads had the steaks with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies (not the frozen kind). It was a mix of grilled squashes, tomatoes & onions. They could not stop talking about it, they loved it. 

I ordered the Veggie Burger, recommended by the waitress as one of the popular picks. I enjoyed it, it was freshly made with a mix of vegetables: squashes, zucchini, red peppers, onions, & mushrooms. Definitely not a frozen Boca burger. One thing about it was some of the vegetables fell apart while I was eating it. I loved the bun and the curly fries were fresh. 

We ordered burgers, pastas, chicken tenders, steaks, grilled cheese and chicken wrap. 

The steaks and pasta dishes were served with iceberg salad and garlic bread. 

The burgers and wraps came with a choice of curly fries, crinkle cut fries or sweet pots (sweet potato fries.) 

Most dishes we ordered were around $10. A great value! There was another family in the restaurant and although we had a huge order, the wait was not long at all. 

The waitress we had was amazing, great service and had great suggestions when I couldn't decide what to order. 

Everyone enjoyed what they ordered and it was more than enough food, we all walked out of there stuffed & satisfied!

TIPS: 

* Breakfast, lunch and dinner served all day.  

* Coffee is from Colorado River Coffee Roasters!

* Dine outside at the patio when it gets cooler.

* Check out the wall of quotes in the bathroom! 


Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Nice and small away from the busiest of Hoover damn!  Must try the pound puppy dog!  Service excellent!  Stop here for a great meal"}
{"text":"I think the way to go here is burgers and fries, sandwiches that kind of thing. I have no idea what I was thinking and ordered Chicken Parm, I am very picky with my Italian so that was not a smart move on  my part. It was ok, expensive for what they served. I think dinner is ok not great, best bet is more simple dishes here. 
  The beef soup was not very good, the coffee was cold and old. But I was so tired I accepted refills.
 The waitress was fine.
If you don't get any extras it is probably a great place, we just didn't know what to order. One  day we will go back and get a simple lunch. Seeing the reviews here I am betting we were here on an off day.
 Good for casual eats. And the décor is cute. Also convenient location and easy parking.
 In fairness we went on a holiday weekend in the middle of the day so if things were off they got the pass."}

{"text":"A wonderful place to eat. Super friendly staff. The owner-chef came out from the kitchen to chat with us. We could tell he was very involved, concerned, and proud of his restaurant. The hamburger was among the best I have eaten and I hear the Reuben sandwich is world class. A friend and famous entertainer, who now lives in Ecuador, visited and stayed for several days at our house in Boulder City while we were out of town. He ate all of his meals there and is returning to Nevada next month and has arranged a large family and friends reunion dinner at the Little Grille. He could have chosen any place in Las Vegas but his pick is The Little Grille."}

Great place in Boulder City."}
{"text":"OMFG!!! Found this place by mistake, 4 of us ordered from all over the menu.. other than pleased grunting there was no words once the food arrived and everyone was ecstatic about the food they ordered once finished! Would consider planning my trips to Vegas around stopping here on the way in and out of town. MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I was looking for gluten free dining in Boulder City this came up. I called to double check and I was told no gf options.Please update the info."}
{"text":"OK, all I had was oatmeal and coffee so I can't tell you if the rest of the food is fabulous or not.  But the coffee was very good and the oatmeal, which I eat in lots of places, was very very good. 

Service was great.  The interior is really cute.  I was put off for a long time by the drive thru -- assuming this place was a fast food place.  But nope.  I will go back. 

Oh, if you have a \"frequent bladder\" you might wanna take a pass.  I didn't use the restroom but it appears to be \"out back\".  I never like leaving the building to wash my hands or use the facilities."}
{"text":"What a great little place!  The owner is so friendly that he comes out and checks on customers himself.  The service is outstanding and the philly cheesesteak is the best I've ever had!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger with half curly fries and half onion rings! And Fry sauce! Great desserts!!! The place is quaint and super friendly.  A must in Boulder City!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner!! I'm a local and every Sunday this is my place after church.  The crispy french toast are to die for!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a local type diner for breakfast on the way to Hoover Dam. Found this little gem with a huge amount of charm and personality. My wife and I ordered the breakfast special of biscuits and gravy with bacon or sausage and 2 eggs. Homemade, fluffy biscuits covered with the best sausage gravy I've ever tasted. The coffee is the best I've ever had in a diner. It's family operated and very welcoming. If you're going to be anywhere near Boulder City and you want a great meal at a great price, this has got to be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"Our lunch on an early Saturday afternoon two days before April 24, 2017 was A-OK. The weather was mild and we sat outside eating and enjoying the slow, small town pace of Boulder City. I'm happy to say there were no physical ill effects from our meal, but there is a caveat that you can discover on your own. Just note that there have been 12 reviews removed since May 10, 2017. Just like other factors such as location, menu, and previous reviews help in the decision making process, knowing a restaurant's history of consistency can also give you valuable information and assist you.

Still serving breakfast at 2 PM, my daughter ordered the half order of crispy fried French toast with a side of sausage and my wife and I ate from the lunch menu both having burgers. My light eating daughter couldn't finish the portion of French toast so, that meant I got a side of French toast with my burger. The eggy bread was pretty standard with corn flakes that added a nice texture. The \"Kobe\" burger was satisfactory, but definitely not worthy of its claims of being Kobe beef nor of its $16 price tag. The dark beer for the day was comically New Castle brown ale with a charge of $5 a bottle. The large portion of crispy sweet potato fries was one of the best parts of the meal.

Service was friendly and efficient, especially with the late lunch rush that came on the patio. The total before tip for three was $55. Overall, the food was OK and it's good to see that any previous issue has been rectified. For your well being, I would recommend coming only if you have done your homework and have made sure they have their ducks in a row because the history has proven otherwise."}
{"text":"I have never had to wait so long for a mediocre hotdog. Curly fries are supposed to be curly! and crispy! Not soggy ropes!  I wish I knew this place was on dirty dining 3 times before I ate there. never would have stepped foot in there."}
{"text":"Delicious! A super cute little restaurant. Our waiter, Race, was fantastic. We enjoyed the NY Strip and Blackened Salmon. Their homemade ranch dressing is delicious as was everything we ate. Fried Zucchini Wedges were awesome. We stayed next door at the Sands and enjoyed the brief walk for dinner!"}
{"text":"French toast delish! Service was Great!! Country Fried Chicken also yummy!! Would recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a 34 C grade stay away nasty people and foods, looks like chainsaw Massacre"}
{"text":"Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had the Kobe Beef burger cooked medium rare with Sweet Potato fries...
All I'm gonna say is, mouth-gasmic!!!
Truly delicious... Gem of a place."}
{"text":"It was all great! Fresh food and the employees are very  courteous.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Despite my five star rating we had a problem on our last visit to The Little City Grille.  As always, upon entering at 410 PM on Wednesday, October  16, 2013.  My wife and I pass through Boulder City at least twice a month and always patronize this great diner.  Their burgers and breakfasts are terrific and the service is always \"top drawer\".  Since we were passing through a little later this trip, we decided to go in and check out The Little City Grille's dinner menu.

Upon entering we were greeted (as always) with a genuine \"hello\" and smile.  The waitress suggested an appetizer (because they were delicious and 50% off).  Since my wife was going to have the NY Steak we chose the \"hand breaded\" mushrooms.  A few minutes later the waitress reluctantly returned to tell us they were out of the mushrooms.  She suggested the jalepeno poppers.  \"Sure\", we said the off she went.  Well, a few minutes later she returned to tell us that the poppers were also not available.  We decided to just order.

As I mentioned, my wife ordered the NY steak with mashed potatoes and veggies while I ordered the chicken parmesan  with a side of linguini.  When our dinners arrived my wife's steak dinner looked great.  In fact, the steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes and gravy were very good.  The vegetable medley of squash and tomatoes was fresh and lively.  My meal, on the other hand, was not so good.  The breaded chicken was topped with a generous portion of Swiss cheese.  The chicken was actually cooked very well.  The breading was crunchy on the outside while leaving the tender and moist meat on the inside.  Unfortunately, the meal went downhill from there.  The sauce was not a marinara sauce as promised on the menu.  It was more like chopped tomatoes on top of cold lifeless noodles.  The sauce (if you want to call it that) was over-spiced with heavy rosemary overtones.  As I mentioned, the noodles were actually cold.  I even checked the center bottom of the plate which left me with the same conclusion:  cold noodles.  

I gained the waitress's attention and explained the problem.  She appeared genuinely concerned and took the meal back for what she called a \"re-heat\".  I knew then I was in for more problems.  When the meal came back the entire meal was steaming.  The chicken no longer had its crunch, the chicken was dry, and the noodles, although hot, were over-cooked and tasteless.  I suspect the cook merely microwaved my meal.  Well, for $13.00  I do not expect a microwaved meal.

I tried The Little City Grille web site to contact the owners about these issuea but, unfortunately, there is no place to leave feedback.

We will continue to patronize The Little City Grille on a regular basis; however, if we pass through Boulder City late in the afternoon again, we will probably try another restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Driving thru we stopped at this great little spot.  Fresh food!  Great staff.  Highly rated!  Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"If you are ever in town looking for a great comfort food meal, this is the place.  

We were on our way back to the Strip after visiting the Hoover Dam.  We took a slight detour through Boulder City Historic District and came upon this little GEM of a diner.  My daughter wants to give them 10 stars!  Both kids had the kids burger with house cut curly fries and a soda.  The burgers are a generous hand formed patty served on a potato bun.  The burgers were juicy and delicious.  The fries are blow your mind DELICIOUS!  I helped devour the kids side and then our awesome server told use they are bottomless!!  Yo, I was like MORE PLEASE!

They also give your their homemade fries dipping sauce and ranch dressing.  What a great treat!  The sauce made it even harder to stop eating the fries,

Well not only were the kids meals yummy and hit the spot, I enjoyed the BBQ grilled chicken salad.  It was a perfect mix of lettuce, tomato, black beans, corn, cilantro and juicy chicken.  Generous in size but not so big I could eat every last morsel!"}
{"text":"We were driving to Grand Canyon and had no time for breakfast. My husband stopped here to grab something and the food was super good. We just had a bunch of breakfast wraps - all freshly made, very yummy. I also had the iced tea - unsweetened and it was good. Probably the same you get everywhere but I noticed it does not have the strong bitter taste which some do.

The place looks really cute and it has a very nice outside patio with some sand and sand toys for kids - I am looking forward to coming back soon for lunch and sit outside with the kids.

Last but not least, like most people already mentioned - service is super extra mega ultra friendly. Nothing fancy, but everyone is genuinely nice which makes it a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the family, had the chicken wrap, cheesesteak, and grilled chicken sandwich with milkshakes, curly fries and sweet potato fries.  Everything was yummy.  Service was a bit slow but very friendly... Most people on yelp say the service is great so we must have just had some bad timing.  We were very happy with the meal."}
{"text":"We found this local restaurant on Yelp.  Didn't know what to expect.  But here's what we got....

EXCELLENT SERVICE!  A guy named Race was our server and was super sweet and very attentive!

We ordered our food and it came out quick and 100% correct!  Delicious!!!!!!  

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something off the beaten path.  They have breakfast and dinner all day every day!"}
{"text":"My family had been here once before and came back specifically for the curly fries. We were disappointed to learn the machine was down. The head cook/ owner? Happened to stop by and our sweet waitress told him we were hoping on fries. He was able and willing to make them by hand for us much to our surprise. We were so excited and grateful. We were celebrating my birthday and they really took care of us. The fries are amazing! Think the best fair fries but not nearly as greasy. We will be back!  Can't thank u enough!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the cutest breakfast place on the way to Hoover dam.  Not only was the food amazing but the staff was friendly and warm.  The French toast was crispy and buttery and sweet at all the right levels.  I would come back again without hesitation!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute and the staff is awesome. The pepper jack cheese sticks were the highlight of the meal - really delicious. The salad and wraps were bland. The French dip was a hit with my son. Very clean, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just saw Dirty Dinning where this spot got a terrible grade. Worst of all, the manager was a total prick about it. How dare he push a woman simply because she was doing her job and asking questions."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Burgers were excellent, home made curly fries great too, and Brandi was the best"}
{"text":"Absolutely best food we ever have eaten.  Honest good food with a flair that is different than you can imagine. 

Mac and cheese with chili and onions A+ and truly perfect.  

Service was great.  Kind and friendly.  Two ladies worked well together.  

My wife had French Toast House special.  Unbelievable taste and texture.  

What a find.  

Also chef and owner customized my chicken sandwich to perfection. 

Home town love."}
{"text":"Great spot! Service was excellent and fast even though there was only 1 waitress and she was awesome. Party of 10, we got seated right away (outdoor). $5.95 for their burger menu (mushrooms and swiss,  bacon &blue cheese,  etc) and 11.99 for the Kobe burger which was great! The onion rings were the star of the night, beer battered and just plain delicious.  My only suggestion would be to keep the patio cleaner (specially the giant sand box) but still a good stop while in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this pace.  The chief always has delicious specials and caters to others needs. Love the homemade items on menue!!! They made an outdoor seating area in the front and a visible bike rack on the side! Love riding my bike and stopping for breakfast and lunch. Friendly staff and owner make this place 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Boulder City. Fried pickles are amazing.Also love the chili mac bowl.Service is always friendly and helpful.Prices are reasonable.Restarant is spotless."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. Before coming here I had heard quite a few terrible opinions on this place. I still do from time to time. 

I have had a great burger and a couple sandwiches here. Great food. Slightly pricey but that is expected in boulder city. 

Overall I would say it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"On the main drag in the historic part of Boulder City Nevada is a quaint little grill worth the stop. The service is outstanding and the food was excellent. We decided to stop for breakfast before hover dam and discovered this gem of a grill. The staff was warm and friendly and very accommodating as I have severe food allergies. I love finding these little homie diners that welcome you when step in the door. They have a great atmosphere to enjoy your meal in. Pictures and pieces of history line the tables and walls. I definitely will be stopping my next going thru Boulder city."}
{"text":"Super friendly and attentive staff, good food, and how can you go wrong with counter seating, they even have a working driver thru."}
{"text":"This was such a great place to eat.. My husband had the beef dip..said it was ok.My chicken fried steak was wonderful.Also friend had BLT..said
it was very good...The service is friendly...They have great Bloody Mary's..
Next time we are in BC...will return to this friendly little diner.Not a noisy
place,nice place to eat and visit without blaring TV....or loud music blasting..Nice an quite...Love you can order breakfast or lunch even in evening...."}
{"text":"As you head into Boulder city this little place is on the right side.

Looking at it you know it is a older place that has  been there for awhile. 
We have been here once so far. So happy we tried it out!
It is one of those places you would think it was just a diner type food like a Denny's... Well this place is actually really good nothing like a Denny's!
We did find the dinner menu was a little higher and asked if we could still order off their Dinner menu. They were very nice and accommodating. We just felt like having a sandwich not a full dinner. Lunch prices are pretty good.
My husband got the turkey club with their homemade chili. He really enjoyed it,
I had the Philly Steak and cheese with a side of chili, It was very good!
we would totally recommend if your looking for a place for lunch before going to Hoover dam you can go through the main town red light and this is straight ahead not too far. 
After you eat you can stay going straight and head to hoover dam that way through the small town.We like going that way much better to see Lake Meade.
Over all we liked the service they were very friendly and the food was good!
Try the chili it good!
We will for sure go back here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! Everyone was super nice and our food came out quick. I had just finished a trail race at Bootleg Canyon and came in for a quick bite to eat and I was not disappointed. Customers and the folks working there struck up a conversation about running and the race. Would definitely recommend eating there whether you're looking for a quiet place to eat or a little socializing."}
{"text":"Excellent hands down.   Reasonably priced, great staff, and good food.     I had the southwest chicken sandwich and the handcut curly fries which were both extraordinary.    I needed to grab food fast and literally just drove by and stopped.   I wasn't familiar with the area or even had time to check others reviews, but this by far exceeded my expectations.   

My friend that lives in the area says they have an excellent burger.  Unfortunately I'm out of time and will no be able to return.   I also heard sweet potato fries mentioned, which I would love to try.  

Stop in, you won't be disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food! Curly fries were not seasoned well and were very greasy. Fried pickles were not slices and the breading was too much and greasy. I gave 4 stars for portion size and great, friendly service. But food was too greasy overall and sat heavy in the stomach."}
{"text":"So Happy We Chose this place for lunch while visiting Boulder City. Prices were really great and the food was yummy. Love that they had minestrone soup for my 11 month old."}
{"text":"Really nice cozy restaurant, with nice ambient mood & nice violin music playing.  I had the chicken Cordon Bleu w/Potatoes & grilled veggies....it was great!  The breaded chicken was amazing, along with everything else.

Best part about this place was Brandi, provided excellent service the whole time and took the time to learn my name.  Probably the sweetest & personable service I've had since I've moved to the Las Vegas area.

I'll be back for the Chicken Parm, as recommended!!"}
{"text":"Theres something seriously wrong with the owner of this place. Saw him kick patrons out of the restaurant and call the police on them for seemingly no reason what so ever. Caused a big scene and started yelling at a table of customers. Does not make a good name for yourself in a small town where word gets around quick, And believe me, word WILL get around...
Food was only average. I think I've had better from a high school cafeteria or on an airplane to be honest. If you want GOOD food, I would recommend skipping this place and hitting up some of the other mom and pop restaurants in town. You will have a lot better experience I'm sure and the owners know a thing or two about RESPECT. If you are coming to Boulder City on vacation, think twice before coming here. To the owner, if you are reading this, I think I'll be laughing when I see your little \"enterprise\" go out of business. No one wants to be treated that way."}
{"text":"Awesome find!  Service is A++.  Came in after finishing Rage Triathlon with a major appetite. Had the breakfast burrito made to order.  This place is quaint and has clever sayings all over the walls. Lots of fun Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe, great customer service, we found this on Yelp on the way to a Hoover Dam tour. What a great find, thanks and we will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in a beautiful location. French toast, omelette, wrap, and chicken fried steak were all yummy!! Staff is friendly and service was excellent. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here just because I was hungry and they were here.  I'm glad I did.  I had the Green Chili  burger.  Not too big, not too small.  Just a hint of spice from the roasted chilies.  An interesting ranch sauce and a slice of melted cheese.  And the bun gets a bravo from me.  Not a commercial bun, but a locally baked beauty.  Exactly what I was looking for.  The fries were an afterthought, but that was my fault.  I should have taken the sweet potato fries.  The staff is welcoming and helpful.  Tip them well and spread the word."}
{"text":"Blown away by the customer service. Everything we ordered was amazing. Bacon Burger is \"really good, and very rich\". Can't go wrong with the curly fries either. The berry Mimosa is out of this world! I had the Pound Puppy Hot Dog, smothered in homemade Chili and Cheese. The Chili is some of the best restaurant chili I've had. (I'm gonna need to get this recipe! LOL) the hot dog is SO GOOD. Never had one as good, and I grew up going to dodger games. Outside of the dodger dog...this. This is the dog. Along with the friendly staff, low key environment, this made for a lovely lunch date for two."}
{"text":"We used to go there 3 times a shift, but not anymore they did not do well on their health checks. They were on Dirty Dinners got a c and were retested and still got a c. So we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a stop on the way to or from Boulder Dam.  Very quaint, clean; good service and high quality food.  Keep in mind that like most Boulder City establishments, it closes at 8pm.  Now that I live in Boulder City, I will become a regular.  Don't let the word \"grille\" in the name fool you.  It's a nice little restaurant."}
