{"text":"I've given this place a couple chances and I'm ready to give up on it.  On my first visit, I had the worst poutine I've ever eaten. The fries were too skinny, the gravy lacked flavour, but worst of all, they used used the wrong cheese. Instead of the traditional cheese curds, they used blocks of some kind of strong cheddar. The cheese completely overpowered the rest of the ingredients and just did not taste right. I ended up throwing half of it away.  On my most recent visit, I decided to go out on a limb and order their Hawaiian burger, which was on special for $9.50. Even with the discounted price, it was still pretty expensive. Unfortunately, I got this burger to go. By the time I realized they had given me the much less expensive \"Classic burger\", I was already at home. The burger was bland and overcooked. I was more than a little disappointed. The only reason I can see myself going back would be to angrily demand the slice of pineapple and jalape√±os they owe me."}
{"text":"This was the worst poutine I've ever had.  It was entirely flavourless and the fries became really soggy.  The service was friendly enough- nothing special though."}
{"text":"Decent price for combo.  Patty ok, a touch undercooked for my liking, but interesting flavour.  Fries were terrible, tasted like they were refried."}
{"text":"I would say the burger was neither big nor chubby. But it was burnt. The fries were very good and the prices were not too high compared to some nearby establishments. Nice staff, could use a little cleaning. really liked the chalkboard walls!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this is a burger place. So it doesn't look fancy inside but boy do they get their burger right! I ordered their regular burger special and while waiting we chatted with the guy behind the counter. A very friendly guy who informed us that their burger meat gets grounded at the restaurant everyday. Fresh grounded meat! None of that frozen stuff you find everywhere else. On top of everything he told us that their ground beef was halal, so my wife tried a burger too.   The burger was juicy and very tasty, cooked the way we asked.  It was also chubby, so the name is warranted. Our order came with a side of fries and a drink for way less that what chains like Hero Burger charges.  This is now my burger joint of choice in Toronto. You should try it too if you want a pure simple delicious burger."}
{"text":"Ok, went again with my wife as promised.  She said the veggie burger was not as good as \"Burger Bar\" up the street.  However, my carnivore hamburger was again excellent, so I refuse to budge my original  4 star rating.  But for the best burger in the area -- 5 stars! -- head to \"Hero Burger\" at Bathurst and Bloor."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for hamburgers in Kensington. Love the choice of the ingredients (ex. Jamaican Burger). Service is fast and kind."}
{"text":"Got drawn in walking by and seeing the combo special - Original 6oz burger, shoe string fries, and a can of pop (soda) for $5 plus tax. Hard to go wrong, I thought. Burger was sort of like those charcoal ones you'd get at a big church fair or something (I guess non-church fairs have charcoal grills, too) - fries were good but unseasoned. My diet Coke was especially effervescent.   They take credit cards and are open until 10pm. Big space- the chairs have some of the best lumbar support I've felt in a fast food restaurant.  A-OK with me."}
{"text":"I'll admit it. When these guys opened, I loved it. The food was good, and the prices were good. This is Kensington Market, and while it isn't always true, you hope to get a good lunch at a good price. Since I work in the market I've been to a lot of places. From the look of CFB, the name seems to fit. You expect a greasy burger, at a greasy price.  It had been a while since last visiting after arguing with the guy about how the special didn't include a drink this time. \"Only water\" he told me, as a compromise I guess. I had been there a dozen times before, but this time it cost more and didn't have my choice of drink. So after a long break from there, I decided to give them another try. Some pals of mine went by, and mentioned how good of a deal it was. \"A burger, fries, and drink\" for $5.65 total. That is a good deal, no? Well, not if you are a vegetarian like me, as it turns out. My food - no greater in size, weight or variety - cost DOUBLE! Does not-meat-stuff cost more? What sort of meat are they getting which is so much cheaper than a puny veggie patty?  So I don't expect to return. The food is good (the fries are very good), but the place is so damn inconsistent, and over priced (depending on what you order).  It is - by all respects - a dive kitchen. If you want the special I'm sure you will be happy."}
{"text":"I went recently and had a burger. I'm a big burger fan and I haven't had great experiences at Burger Bar up the street (always dry), so I was hoping for something good out of this place.   The food wasn't bad, but it really wasn't special either. The bun was good, and the price was right but the burger was a little greasy and the fries were soggy. The biggest negative for me at this place was just that it was pretty dirty. I'm not that picky, but I want  a restaurant to be clean and everywhere I looked it just seemed like that really wasn't a priority for these guys. Tables weren't wiped. Condiment bottles were sticky and covered in their contents. The ceiling tiles were falling apart. They didn't take the time to take the drinks out of the cardboard flats in the fridge. It all seemed very lazy to me.  I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner this evening with my boyfriend. We both didn't think it was great. First off the place is very stark and cold looking. And for the love of god no one in Kensington likes the pop station z103.5. It was awful trying to eat my meal to Poker Face and California Gurlz. FML.   I had the veggie burger which was supposed to be a portobello, with goat cheese and peppers however when it was served it was a piece of grilled eggplant and regular mushrooms on the top with the peppers and goat cheese. The eggplant wasnt substantial enough to be burgerish like a portobello cap would have been. I also asked for coldslaw instead of fries but got fries. hm. I never complain and send stuff back so I ate it and my thighs will hate me later.   My boyfriend had some sort of burger that he said he didn't enjoy either. We both questioned if it was cooked as well... I told him just eat it since he was almost done anyway.   We're gonna stick to our fave place Oh Boy Burger on Queen W. We're kind of regretting not going to Big Fat Burrito for dinner now. Le boo, herp derp."}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed with this burger.   I ordered the Hawaiian, which came with roasted jalapenos (which packed a punch!), peameal bacon and pineapple slices. The combination of these ingredients were pretty good, and the burger seemed homemade, but there was nothing really special about it.  Service was fine, but seeing that there are a bunch of other places to eat in the area (my original plan was to go to Hot Beans, but they were filming something inside.. stupid Toronto), I probably won't be coming back here.  Also, if a burger is $7.89, it better propel me into some food dream reverie. This burger simply filled the hole in my tummy (and then burned another one later on with the pepper)"}
{"text":"now closed."}
{"text":"The service here is really friendly. Sometimes the owner makes suggestions for new topping combos for the burgers and lets you try them at no extra cost. They bring the food right up to your table. Everytime I've gone they've been super friendly and attentive.  Prices are insane! The normal stuff is standard fare pricing. You pay for the quality, and the quality is great! Hand shaped patties and fresh cut fries. Nothing frozen here. What's insane is they still have their combo special up! $5 combo for burger and fries and a drink. And no it's not a smaller burger either!"}
{"text":"Gets the job done. The burgers are big and chubby. The name does not lie.  It is an average tasting burger but also very filling. They have combo options that can add up quickly. This is a good place to get in, get fat, and get out."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: For $6 for their classic burger + fries + a drink, it's hard to be a hater.  I've been here a couple of times since they originally opened and were called Craft Fat Burger. Now they have plastic pictures of burgers (made from that same material you see with real estate lawn signs), but it's hard to tell if it's depicting their burger or some generic burger.  Each visit has been greeted by a blairing ghetto blaster of some soft rock channel at the door, followed by a trek through their deeply desoloate, linoleum floored seating area to order what can only be described as a \"meh\" burger.  HOWEVER, you don't come here expecting to eat like royalty. You come here to get full, and full you will be if all you have is $6 (plus tax) in your pocket. Their combo is insanely cheap to the point where I don't bother ordering anything else. Stay cheap my friends."}
{"text":"I was actually in the mood for something less-burgerish when I happened upon this lime-green monster in Kensington. \"Craft. Fat. Burger,\" I remember reading out loud. What the mustard? Despite my better instincts, I strolled in.  This relatively large diner probably seats about thirty. The bottom half of the walls are deep ketchup red, and everything from your chest up is a bright mustard yellow giving you the feeling that you're submerged in a vat of condiments. Lavatories, as always, are in the basement, and you need a key.  I was excited by the advertised Grand Opening special: $5.50 for a classic burger, fries and a drink -- but I wanted a veggie burger and it wasn't covered by the plan. Not only did it cost a bit more, the veg was pretty small, kind of dry, and unlovable. It might have been helped by the wackload of extra sauces or toppings they have available but they cost extra ($1) and I was already jonesing a cheap bite. With Burger Bar only a few doors down, this place will have to be slightly cheaper or slightly tastier to justify its existence.  Obligatory Title Pun: Craft. Fat. Burger. (I got nothing.)  Menu Readability: Written in chalk by someone who clearly hates chalk.  Need to mention: There was a dude in here wearing white pants and a jean jacket.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'd rather not be submerged in a vat of condiments."}
{"text":"Went in for the opening special of their original 6oz burger, fries, and a can of pop (or water) for $5+tax. I liked it! Maybe because it slightly reminded me of Johnny's Burgers out in Scarborough - that old school no-frills burger taste, none of that fancy-schmancy stuff they're doing to burgers these days. If they served their burgers though at the same price as Burger Bar's burgers ($11.50, no sides) then I'd be giving less review stars.   I didn't find the staff to be rude (they even replaced the can of pop for water and didn't charge extra, places usually charge extra for that). The place does need some help with their decor though.   As long as they keep their prices at a decent price, I'd keep going back."}
{"text":"Yet another place in Toronto that serves \"gourmet\" burgers, though the establishment is faaaar from looking like a place that sells gourmet food :p I ordered the Hawaiian burger with a side of sweet potato fries. My first impression was \"Hey, it is chubby!\" It was a good burger: the patty was good, the grilled pineapple was good, the jalapeno gave a nice kick to it, and I definitely enjoyed a slice of peameal bacon in it :) The fries, however, were just OK. BQM Burger and Joey's have much better sweet potato fries. The service was non-existent, but it's expected from a place like this, so I'm not going to complain about that.   By the way, their washrooms are located in the basement that looks like a dungeon. I was so scared and I've never peed so quickly in my life! :p"}
