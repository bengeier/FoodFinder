{"text":"This is a great spot for a great fork. Italian to the core, the staff is Italian and the restaurant is said to be family owned. 

We took the Rigatoni and the risotto. Both plates were absolutely delicious. Flavours flowed through in a unexpected harmony. 

The wine card is complete and offers a great selection of privately imported Italian bottles. 

It might look pricy at first, but the food here is worth every penny. 

If you're in Montreal be sure to stop by Lucca for a meal."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. 
The Owner and waiters were really nice and friendly. 
They served bruschetta and The appetizer was fried calamari . Taste so good. 
And the risotto went with veggies and meat also very nice. Tuna was cooked medium and very fresh very juicy. 
The dessert we had chocolate souffl√© I really loved it because it's Not very sweet but yummy. 
It's a little pricy but we really enjoyed it and had a good time. I will go back to there again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, always come here for special occasions.  Staff is very pleasant and warm, very cosy feeling to the place and the food is absolutely phenomenal"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great. Terrific value for lunch with soup/salad, entree and tiramisu for ~$25+tx. One of Montreal's hidden gems. Everything here is good. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Lucca is a small vibrant resto located in the heart of Little Italy so you'd expect them to nail it. As soon as you arrive they start you off with a complimentary order of bruchetta which is excellent and a very nice touch. 

For appetizers we ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella, made with beautiful fresh ingredients, it was amazing. I suggest that you ask them to add a bit of balsamic to the dish, a reliable source tells me that the previous chef use to serve it this way. We also ordered the calamari, which was very disappointing. I love calamari and I didn't even finish the plate. Wow, I can't believe that there was calamari in front of me and I didn't eat it! It was very chewy and not enjoyable, it tasted like something you'd pickup at the food court. 

For our main course my wife had the filet mignon and I had the lobster pasta. The filet was uninspiring and a bit salty and the lobster pasta evening more disappointing. The pasta was served with a lobster bisque for the sauce, a well done lobster bisque is one of my favorite things. Unfortunately this was very bland and uninteresting. The pieces of lobster in the pasta were few and far between. 

For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake.Chocolate cake is one of my favorite things on earth. Again this dish lacked flavour and any sort of punch or excitement. 

Overall I must say the meal was very uninspiring and with so many other great options available I will not be back to Lucca any time soon."}
{"text":"Petit Italia, for my Italian husband, was a must see. This restaurant was highly recommended by someone at Bar Italia. I had the spaghetti with beef, mushrooms, truffles and spinach and it was well done!  Not too much truffle and the pasta was al dente. The staff and service was excellent and the restaurant well appointed. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"One of the best risotto's I've had."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Small menu changes slightly all the time everything is amazing. The garnishes are even amazing. 
Its a small cozy place.  Perfect for date night."}
{"text":"I'm a born and raised Asian from Asia who's trying to integrate into Canadian culture. I only started eating Italian food when I moved to montreal. Gotta say this is my fav Italian resto. My boyfriend is half Italian and he totally agrees with me. Best risotto I've had in my life. We go there for his and my birthdays or any other special occasions because it's not a place we. An afford every weekend. Lol maybe that's for the better after all"}
{"text":"Nice find in Little Italy. An established Older crowd. Cavatelli bolognese was tasty. A little Smokey. The calamari was really good and a decent wine selection."}
{"text":"*The Chalkboard Restaurant*
This was a horrible experience for an Italian restaurant. You get your menu from a chalk board on the wall, It's hard to read especially when its above your head. If that day they don't have something you like, well guess what you go hungry and go to McDonald's a few steps away.

They have the bistro concept, everything is \"small\". Small restaurant, small menu, small portions."}
{"text":"This place is in the heart of Montreal's Little Italy. Menu on a chalk board was quaint, but hard to follow. I felt pressure to decide when the waiter visited my table to explain the menu. Since I was dining alone, the drink selection was limited. (Maybe if I ordered a bottle of something, but I only wanted a glass.) 

I began the meal with a complimentary Bruchetta on Crusted Bread. The tomato and olive oil was so fresh. I then ordered the Arugula Salad with Shaved Parmesan and a Balsamic Vinegar Reduction. Yum! Ate every bit. 

Then I ordered the Farfalle Pasta with Lamb Ragu. The portion was huge. Couldn't finish. It tasted very nice -- not out of this world, but still quite good. 

Only down side, the price. Meal for one with salad, drink and tip was over $50. For that price, I expected more. Probably won't return."}
