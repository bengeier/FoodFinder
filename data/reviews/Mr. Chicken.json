{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was great. Make sure you get the 3 piece with the biscuit"}
{"text":"The ad says that Mr. Chicken is \"all about the chicken,\" but I'm not sold.   We decided to check out the store in Solon, as we were headed home, and the original plan was to just pick up a family sized meal.  Our meal plans changed somewhat after reviewing the menu, and I do want to say that the cashier/order taker was very courteous and helpful as we decided what to order.  My partner is a big fan of fried fish, and apparently Mr. Chicken has been hooking up with Ms. Fish on the side, because that item featured fairly prominently on the menu.  In addition to the usual \"whitefish\" they also had perch, and we decided to give both a try. The perch came in an order of 2 pieces and the whitefish came in an order of 3 pieces. Frankly we were both disappointed by the perch; it was somewhat dry and not that appealing. The breading was thin and crumbly, and it was over-salted.  The whitefish, on the other hand, was a perfectly good piece of battered fish. The coating was crisp and crunchy, and the seasoning was fine. Although, I'm not sure that a \"Long John Silver's\" or \"Arthur Treacher's\" would not have been better.  We also got a 12-piece family size meal, which came with cole slaw and biscuits. The coating on the chicken was VERY salty, and I don't think it was as good as a KFC or Popeye's - though not measurably worse.  All in all, it was an underwhelming gastronomic experience. I'm glad we tried it - it was fine for what it was, but I don't think we'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had the grand kids over last Friday night and decided to stop at Mr. Chicken located at Pearl & Ridge in Parma, OH.  I ordered the Picnic Pack, but when I got home you would have thought I ordered a wing dinner - I could not believe the number of wings I had in my dinner (which counted toward the total piece count) and how small the wings were.....I must say I was surprised since other times I had stopped I did not have this problem.  When I buy Mr. Chicken next time, I think I will give another location a try."}
{"text":"I just ordered a three piece dinner and a bowl. I noticed my son wasn't eating the mashed potatoes in the bowl. When I dug into my mashed potatoes, I knew why. They were like that paste from back in the day--thick and BLAND. You know you tasted that paste like I did. The potatoes were horrible! The biscuit was chewy, and the chicken was nothing to brag about. The coleslaw was good. That was the only thing I enjoyed. This is the reason why Mr. Chicken can miss me. They are too inconsistent in their product."}
{"text":"Been getting the chicken and potato wedges for years. It's always good. Servers are courteous. Once they even gave me the wrong order. When I got home I called and they gave me my next order free. What else can you ask."}
{"text":"The service is a little slow but the food is great. I never had a problem eating here. I just wish it was open right now lol."}
{"text":"Absolute inedible trash... And crappy service to go along with it. Never had a worse meal in my life. I mean, you definitely get what you pay for. Considering it's DIRT cheap..."}
{"text":"Went here and tried the Wednesday's 3 piece chicken strip special with cole slaw and mashed potatoes. Very dissatisfied. The biscuit and mashed potatoes were undercooked and the strips were hard. Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I went there the other day and the side dishes were ok. The chicken fingers were the worst I've ever had. The meat consistency was off, and OMG the salt!   Apparently it's a known fact that this location is not good because while talking about the experience at work, everyone advised that it was a bad location."}
{"text":"Iv been coming to this Mr Chicken for years and I ALWAYS receive excellent food and service. The employees are always super nice and I can't even think of a time where my order wasn't correct. Thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I really have been weary of trying this place out because of the low reviews, but since it was mainly based on service for the negative reviews I figured they still deserved a try. I ordered a 3 piece white meal,which came with a biscuit, slaw and mashed potatoes. I went inside to place my order and the young lady at the cash register was a breath of fresh air and very helpful as she explained things on the menu and made suggestions, I even chatted it up with another customer who said she always comes here when her kids come on town, because they love the here.  My chicken tasted soooo frickin good! It was hot, the biscuit was soft and fluffy and the cole slaw and mashed potatoes had great flavor! I wanted to wait to write this review and try them out a few more times, to see I experienced any of the negativity in the reviews. I am delighted to say i've been there a total of 4 times now and each time has been great! Needless to say they may have some off days, but I never got it:)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mr Chicken, best mashed potato's from any chicken joint.  The Buffalo whole wings are to die for.  Wednesday Special 3pc dinner for $5.69.  SOLD to this guy right here.  Chicken is crispy and very meaty..........My opinion Colonel Sanders you need to step up your game.  The one in Macedonia closed and a Popeye's went in there.  Mr Chicken in Northfield has been there and is still standing. Oh by the way did I mention how good the mashed potato's were????   :-)  Also you need to try the Catfish either in the meal or the sandwich.......  Happy Camper right here"}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of fried chicken, but my family regularly gets take out from this Mr. Chicken when then are visiting, so I've tried it about a half dozen times.  The chicken-eaters keep wanting to go back, so they must like the chicken.  The chicken fingers are hit or miss on freshness.  When they're fresh, they're quite good.  I like the peppery coating.  Everyone agrees that most of the sides are below-average quality and taste.  The mashed potatoes are obviously instant.  The mac and cheese is gluey and lacking flavor, but my kid still eats it.  The collards are watery and have no vegetable flavor left in them, just salt.  My husband does like the biscuits.  The catering prices are very reasonable, and they offer a greater variety of sides for catering orders."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think so by driving past this small storefront, but damn this place makes some great fried chicken! Fresh, juicy, and can't beat the prices.  The staff is always friendly and the remodel looks great- like the commercial says, \"It's all about the chicken!\""}
{"text":"Blah...the chicken really isn't that good personally I would go to Popeyes over this place.  I have eaten at other locations and the chicken was a little better but still nothing to write home about.  Fries are good and cole slaw is good...chicken is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Not great chicken, but really good chicken.  I ordered a 4 whole wing dinner today and the lady who prepared my order and worked the drive-thru window handed me my order and said, \"One of the wings looked small so I gave you an extra one\".  Now that is great customer service.  Instead of waiting until I got home and noticed that one wing was smaller than the other ones, she headed off the experience and replaced it with a better one.  She could have just not included the small one in the order but then she would have to deal with it later.  I think she handled it the best way she could have."}
{"text":"My family and I just moved to the area and the hubby was in the mood for fried chicken over the weekend. So after grocery shopping, we decided to check out the chicken place. Normally we go off of reviews, but since this location didn't have any, we decided to chance it. We ordered a family meal with coleslaw, mashed potatoes, red beans and rice, and mac and cheese. It was delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. Coleslaw was tasty. Im not a fan of mashed potatoes, but the hubby liked them. The mac and cheese was ok. Ive had better. The red beans and rice were pretty spicy. Totally a first for food in Cleveland. I was beginning to think that they didn't know what spice was.   Today, after more grocery shopping, I decided to stop and pick up lunch for the kids and I. WE got a little snack meal deal with three strips and some french fries, some buffalo whole wings and more coleslaw. We live about 20 minutes away right now in the sticks, so when we got home, the wings were pretty soggy. You know what? It didn't even matter, because they were still delicious. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was pretty perfect. The kids really enjoyed the chicken strips and shoestring fries.   I highly recommend Mr. Chicken over KFC or Popeye's any day. Don't let the location fool you. The food is A+!"}
{"text":"Superior food. Moist chicken and great Mac n cheese. I get large family gathering meals from here. The company has strong values and locally operated."}
{"text":"If you get sides they take them out of fridge in an individual container popped them in the microwave they are so hot you'll burn your tongue.  Stuffing was old and dry.    Chicken and corn muffin was cold.    Horrible."}
{"text":"Service is fast every time I come here. The dining room is usually vacant. The chicken is nice and moist and the gravy is exceptional."}
{"text":"I ordered a 2 piece dinner with mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The slaw was good. The mashed potatoes were absolutely terrible. The gravy was literally just thickened water. Someone must've added too much water into whatever gravy mix they use. It was bad. The chicken was bland, but nicely cooked. I haven't been to Mr. Chicken in a few years, and after this experience, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I drove through here one night and got some whitefish and mashed potatoes to go.  In fact, I think everything is to-go here as it appears to not have a dining room.  The place isn't all that expensive, in fact it seems pretty low-end but the food I got was quite good for the price and I consider it a great value.  I thought their macaroni salad was a bit expensive at $1.69 for a small container but it was quite good.  Overall not a bad value and my order, unlike the last reviewer on here, was 100% correct.  The servers were friendly enough as well.    If I'm in the area again I'll come back and check out some of their chicken for sure."}
{"text":"This place is packed on Wed which is the discount day.  The chicken isn't bad at all, and the service is ok.  It's only a pickup place.  Nowhere to eat inside.  Kinda warm inside.  Food is pretty good and have a good variety of sides."}
{"text":"I wanted to let everyone know the owner of this establishment handled my problem and gave me free chicken dinner for my inconvenience.  It is worth trying again for the food."}
{"text":"Seriously, who takes the time to review Mr. chicken? I guess I do. Only ate here once and found it below average. Service was pretty poor too. I would not go back here. The only redeeming quality is that Starbucks is next-door!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a chicken only box for my husband. Got home, opened box and chicken had been cooked in old oil, very dark and crispy. Not the traditional, light golden breaded chicken I've enjoyed for over 20 yrs. never received a reply from customer complaint form that states you'd receive a phone call within 48 business hrs. Fair to say I'll stick with other locations and avoid Northfield Village."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Everything tasted frozen and out of a box. The best part of the meal was the biscuits. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"15 min wait for cold soggy chicken tenders. That's all I have to say. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Give it one star cause the chicken is consistently good but the service sucks! Can't seem to get an order straight even with repeated corrections. Seem to assume what you want instead of giving you what you ask for. Maybe this is hit or miss depending on what day and time you go. Went this Saturday afternoon and was extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Will not be going back to this location. Stopped and bought a meal for 5 paid extra for all breast. The chicken was dried out and the smallest pieces of chicken I had ever seen. The food was cold. We will drive to the Ridge Rd/Pearl location. Better quality of food. The meal  was not worth $37."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time ever eating at a Mr. Chicken... Today was my second time! The food here was amazing and actually tasted freshly made. The girls at the take-out window were very nice as well! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too much of a fan. The chicken wasn't very good. The funnel cake fries were delicious! I'd rather have KFC"}
{"text":"In the fast food fried chicken market, this is one of the better options....I think it is several notches above KFC. (Something went awry at KFC when they switched to \"healthy\" canola oil -- it just doesn't taste right.)  It's a little expensive, but they have a terrific Wednesday special -- a 3-piece dinner for around $5.40 (approx.). We get this often! The wings are really delicious.  Is this health food? I mean, really! of course not! It's a treat.  The side dishes are just OK -- average biscuits, average cole slaw, instant mashed potatoes and canned gravy. One thing they make that is really tasty though is cabbage and noodles with kielbasa -- you probably have to have some Polish blood to appreciate this, but it's not only delicious and homemade tasting but an unusual side dish to fried chicken!  I have never tried the fish, so I can't comment on that. My husband likes the chicken gumbo soup that is an alternative side dish.  Circle a Wednesday on your calendar to give this a try -- for about $22, you can feed a family of four very generously with 4 bargain dinners (there is a 2 piece dinner that is even cheaper)."}
{"text":"So with a name like Mr. Chicken, the chicken would have to be top notch. And it is. This is some of the best fried chicken around. A 9 piece family combo runs $21, and you get mashed potatoes with gravy and coleslaw. Also included is 4 biscuits.  The mashed potatoes are the push button variety (instant). Gravy was good, if not on the thin side. Biscuits were a little too salty, but were the noms. Coleslaw very good.  The store is clean, has a tiny eat-in area, and the employees were very friendly and attentive.  Take note: if going south on Ridge, the local police like to hide behind this building."}
{"text":"This is a coin flip place. I don't love it and I don't hate it. Its just in the middle for me and it depends on what mood I'm in.  They do a great job here keeping up with their busy pace on certain days. The food is fresh and they have been around for a long time. Their breading they use is pretty good and worthy of the name Mr Chicken, can't have a name like that and be below average. They do have good sides as well, all in all this is a good place but I am not the biggest fan.  Its a NEO staple, it has been around for awhile and sue it will continue to pump out some delicious chicken."}
{"text":"Mr Chicken used to be reasonably priced and tasty. Unfortunately they have declined in the past year and a half. We ordered an 8 pc meal 25.99 2 sides. BTW ordered small coleslaw, size of rami can. 2.19, wow! Chicken pcs unrecognizable, thigh, breat?? Greasy and tasted like oil fried in needed changed. Green bean side garlicky, not sure why, never did before. Very disappointed!! Probably won't eat Mr Chicken again, sad used to be good!"}
{"text":"Chicken is dry every time I order. They were all out of biscuits at 4pm and the place was dead. They warm the mashed potatoes in the microwave.  Also poor customer service! So disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for my mom and I. I ordered the spicy ranch wrap combo and corn nuggets. My mom had the two piece meal. We both enjoyed our meal. The chicken is tasty and cooked fresh. The wrap was not spicy more what I call zesty. Their fries are shoe string style but have a taste. The corn nuggets are deep fried small blobs of sweet corn. Not bad.  The staff was super friendly!  The manager asked my opinion of their lemonade as it is not in all their stores yet. He also noticed we were eating in our car and came and gave us some wipes to clean up after our meal."}
{"text":"Note,  this is a drive thru/ carry out only location.  There is no seating.  Our food was fresh. The staff was fairly disengaged,  forgot napkins,   forgot one of our drinks,  didn't smile... But the average employee age was about 17."}
{"text":"Ah, Mr. Chicken. Chosen winner of my 100th review. Where to begin?  Mr. Chicken had a profound impact on me during my most impressionable days as a rebel rousing youth. It was the experiences and lessons learned at this location that helped form the person I am today.   At the tender age of 16, I started working on a part-time basis at Mr. Chicken. I had a buddy who vouched for me and hooked me up in the chicken slinging biz. My duties included prepping all side dishes, deep frying loads of poultry and in the down time, cleaning out the deep fryers and grease traps. It was grunt work, but it paid. Plus, I had a sense of accomplishment afterwards. The trade-off was coming home each and every night reeking of fryer grease. After a long shift, your hair and skin would be coated with a sheen similar to that of a Jersey Shore benny.   The staff there was a splinter faction of stoners, lost souls, promiscuous teens and broken spirits. Each employee had a story to tell. Me? I just needed a summertime job to help save for a car. Everyone there grew to develop a unique friendship. I am under the firm belief that bonds formed in the restaurant/ hospitality business are stronger than any other place of employment short of the Armed Services. If I ever run into one of my ex-coworkers in the future, we'll undoubtedly trade war stories of our memorable times at the chicken factory. It was a bond that will never be forgotten.  As for the chicken, well, I still eat there from time to time, so that has to count for something considering I'm well versed on how everything's made behind the scenes. Plus, it beats KFC and Popeyes.   Mr. Chicken makes no bones about calorie or fat content either. I like that. Fried chicken isn't supposed to be healthy. (Take note KFC. The trans-fat free oil you cook in is an epic failure). At Mr. Chicken, they cook with melted down bricks of shortening. Pure fat, pure flavor. The Chicken, after dredged in a liquid baste is then coated in flour, put into a cage and lowered into the pressure cooker deep fryer. It takes just 10 minutes to finish a batch of chicken this way. Pulling the basket out of the blazing hot grease is a challenge for beginners. Hot oil splashing and melting your skin is one of the hazards of working in such close proximities to a fryer. After a while you get used to it.  Mr. Chicken, thanks for the memories. You have a well run local franchise that's been serving up crispy skinned poultry for over 40 years now and I'm glad I could be a part of it for a few of them."}
{"text":"We've picked up food here a few times this week. It's been pretty good! I love that you can get food thru the drive thru. The location is convenient for me and the menu is simple and easy to choose what to get. The prices seem really high though. $15 for two 3 piece chicken meal without drinks..... Food was good. Not happy that sauce is extra."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely rude and they did not want to apologize after they made a mistake. I asked for management and they were just as rude."}
{"text":"Good as always! Every time I'm in town I always stop by here for the best chicken! Service is normally on point & they take good care of you! Accept this time they ruined my order. I asked for coleslaw & they gave me mash potatoes instead. I was quite upset only because I had my heart set on the coleslaw, even though the mash was still good I wish they would of listened but all in all it was all good! Will I be back o yes I def will it is a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I had them for lunch twice with family as takeout with vouchers, service is great!. I am solidifying my diet to boost ever tighter goals coming up all fall and winter but I must say modestly I like the food here, you  can tell it is white meat chicken. Taking a long break from this but it is always good~ a guilty pleasure indulgence meal for me, old fashioned and decent."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru service! They took our money and never came back out to tell us what's taking them to prepare our food for so long....it was literally 15 mins at a drive thru with nobody at the drive thru window telling us what's going on in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Stupidly tried this place for lunch during the work day. Just to go somewhere different for a change. Grilled chicken wrap looked good with healthy amount of deep green colored lettuce. Undortunately the chicken was hard as a rock. Like way overcooked baked; not grilled. Stopped after one bite because the chicken made me worry about food quality overall. To cap it off, diet coke tasted stale (read: dirty fountain lines)."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Mr. Chicken in a long time but I was craving fried chicken and this was on the way home.  This place is pretty clean which is usually the first thing I look at in a fast food joint before I even think about ordering.  I came during a Friday evening and they were not busy, which was awesome because I was hungryyyyyy!  The employees were nice and fast with our order so I had no complaints. There is a limited amount of tables for anyone wanting to dine in which didn't bother me at the time because there was a table available for my husband and I.  The mashed potatoes didn't have much flavor so I wasn't that fond of it.  The mac and cheese was cold when they handed it to us. And the chicken was lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"When this Mr. Chicken first opened, I never had any issues.  Lately, within the last year the service, customer service, quality of the chicken, and the long waits on chicken have been extremely poor !!! I am so very disappointed.  I really loved the chicken here, but the quality has significantly dropped.  I have gotten old chicken, dried out chicken, and when they run out of chicken (which should not happen) the wait time is ridiculously LONG !!!! The most recent visit I waited 30 minutes when they told me 16 minutes !!! Awful!!!! This brings me to my complaint.  I was there on April 6, 18 at around 6:45 pm.  I came in and ordered 2 chicken dinners.  My total was around $18.  So, after I ordered, they told me the wait would be 16 minutes.  They only had wings.  I went to my car to wait and came back 16 minutes later and they told me another 16 minutes.  So, I went to the bathroom and THERE WAS NO SOAP !!! Then I was wondering how are the employees washing their hands !!! Poor hygiene.  Finally, I took my dinners home and my dinners fell out of the bottom of the bag on the driveway because of the GREASE !!! The chicken in the box was totally saturated in grease. I have a grease stain in my car where I set the bag. The chicken was just dripping !!! So, I called the store and they did NOTHING !!! So, I will be traveling to Giant Eagle as they have excellent fried chicken and less cost !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is as close as to home-cooked chicken that you're going to get. Unfortunately, that's where it flaws. First of all, it's not very flavorful by itself. You will need to add spices to it yourself and I mean a fair amount. The side dishes are also very bland, especially their macaroni and cheese. It resembles more of faux cheese substitute and water. Even adding more cheese to it myself didn't help. It also doesn't help that they ask for a bit too much form such small amounts, even their Wednesday special doesn't compensate this glaring problem."}
{"text":"WORST CHICKEN PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO!        My roommate, her brother and myself went through this establishments drive-thru window.  We ordered a large combo bucket with a few sides.  As soon as we were on our way home we noticed something wrong.  THERE WAS NO SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS!  So, on the way home I called Mr. Chicken from the number on the receipt and I asked if they forgot something with our order?  There were no utensils or napkins.  The employee replied back to me \"We only give out utensils and napkins upon request.\"  WHAT?? So everyone who comes through the drive-thru does not receive anything else with their order unless they ask? Apparently so.  I replied back, \"Thank you, we will not be returning to your store\".  I then hung up and we couldn't eat until we arrived at home.  Luckily, we were close.        The food was not worth the wait though.  Furthermore it wasn't even properly placed in the bag.  They actually put the lid on the mac-n-cheese then placed it in the bag upside down!  Overall, the food was TERRIBLE.  The chicken was room temp, the mashed potatoes were dry and tasted like a box while the mac-n-cheese was soggy and barely had a cheesy taste.  I will not be returning to this establishment any time soon."}
{"text":"Best milkshake! I usually just get okra, my son likes their mac n cheese but the chocolate shake was a surprise."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous in the evening. This is at least the fourth time that I have visited this place after 7pm. They are so focused on cleaning up and getting out of there that they don't want to make chicken. Tonight they were out of wings at 7:40. Last week, they were out of tenders around the same time. Tonight they say a 15 minute wait, knowing anyone going through a \"fast food\" line does not have 15 minutes to wait. Last week, they wouldn't even make the tenders. Again, not the first time. If you are a chicken place, have chicken. You may need to adjust your employees schedules so they don't feel the need to stop cooking in order to get out. It's Friday night...have food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Mr. Chicken on the way home the other night because I had to feed 10 people in a hurry. Pizza would have taken too long and subs would have been pricey, so for $40, Mr  Chicken met all the criteria. The chicken was cooked perfectly, was crispy, and delicious. The sides were yummy too. The only things I found lacking were the biscuits. They were small and dry compared to the competitor down the block, the almighty Colonel. But we chose to avoid the Colonel and support the under dog.   This is a great option if you need to feed a lot of people quickly."}
{"text":"Had their chicken for first time yesterday. The chicken was very good and cooked well. Good choice of side options than most quick service restaurants. The only negative is that they seem to be a bit higher priced than their competition. All in all however I felt it was good value and the food was good. Would recommend to anyone looking for some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"If you want something done right, let Mr. Chicken do it. Delicious hot and piping wings. I can't even finish this review in one go bc I'm in the middle of this treasure box of perfectly cooked pollo. Be right back.   Fifteen minutes later. I've impressed myself and am now considering going into serious competition.. but later on that.   This place was so in demand today that we all waited for our orders for 7 worthy minutes. I sat on a bench with two lovely ladies who were super sweet and even graciously offered me my first taste of the menu.  Do you want to try some? Yes please! They had ordered corn nuggets-fried little corn balls chock full of sweet whole kernels, and sampled some as we waited. It is a fun snack I liked and I'm sure any kid would love :)   Conversing with this pair of insiders, we chatted about the fried chicken of this establishment and one told me confidently, when asked about it's goodness- you'll be back.   I confess I soon had my first wing in the parking lot.   And if you were to ask me if the chicken wings are good, I will tell you the same. You'll be back. And with the same confidence, if I may boldly add, Everyone comes back.   Hear ye, chicken wing lovers! This is a Cleveland original."}
{"text":"My experiences with mr chicken have been mostly good. The only problems I have had here is the time it takes to receive my meals. The food has always been delicious, the three piece dinners, the mashed potato bowls, the snack boats and the fried liver was tasty as well! Pretty tasty but also a little pricey in my opinion. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The chicken livers are the best secret.  They're not on the menu, but you can order them.  Come in small, medium and large orders.  Large livers on steroids?  I don't care.  So tender and crispy!  I get a medium order, medium cooked.  Can get two or three meals with adding leftovers from home."}
{"text":"Have not eaten at Mr Chicken in a long time. The food is still good and the restaurant in Northfield did not disappoint.  I felt the price was a little high, but you can always eat on Wednesday when they have a three piece special. Recommend that you give the place a try."}
