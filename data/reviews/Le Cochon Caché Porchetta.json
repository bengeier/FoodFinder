{"text":"was in the neighbourhood and made a point of stopping in to try a sandwich.   had one made to go, and it was bordering on perfect. great bread, and a bang-on meat-to-crackling ratio. no complaints. worth the 9 dollars.  the owner was behind the counter, preparing the sandwich and was a a pleasure to chat with.   good sandwich alternative to the trek down Saint Laurent to elbow my way through DSLR toting tourists."}
{"text":"Excellent, well filled porchetta sandwhich, priced correctly. The roast has all the qualities one would expect from a well cooked porchetta; I'm looking forward to returning shortly."}
{"text":"Marco was hard at work prepping some fresh ingredients when I stepped in and he immediately set me up with a warm sandwich to take on the road in a neat foil in a matter of minutes. But what a delicious porchetta sandwich it was! Porchetta is a savory, fatty and moist boneless pork roast of Italian culinary tradition and this cut was thankfully low on the fat and very high on the savor!   I like supporting small businesses like this. What a find! My only recommendation? Your sandwich is delicious but salty somewhat and it would be a good idea to perhaps get a sandwich/drink can combo going for a little more than the $8 you pay for a sandwich. It would be easy sales.  That porchetta made me thirsty! But hey, I want more!!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte! La pizza au porc et épinards était fameuse! J'y pense encore! Et le prix plus que raisonnable de 3,50$ ( peut-être 3.75$??) mais en bas de 4$. Le service était sympathique, les clients aussi! Bref j'y retournerai sans faute avec des amis!"}
{"text":"Super petit comptoir à porchetta en plein coeur de Villeray ! On y sert la porchetta en sandwich, en calzone, en poutine... Les portions sont généreuses,  le prix est raisonnable. C'est cochon :-)"}
