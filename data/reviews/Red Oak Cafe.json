{"text":"I tried Red Oak for the first time the other day. The staff was super friendly  and my sandwich was excellent. I had a grilled cheese with tomato and grilled veggies. Though it may seem to be a fairly simply meal, it was very flavorful and awesome. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable and the prices are decent too. I can't wait to try more food from them.

PS: they have a lot of vegetarian options and vegan as well."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Food is so good!!!   My favorites: the fish taco blue plate special on fridays, the vegetarian chili, the roasted potatoes, and the yummy avocado sauce. They have great options for vegetarians.  Everything tastes really fresh too.  I will definitely be eating here on a regular basis. This place is VERY crowded at lunch time.  They do a decent job managing the crowd, but it is difficult to get a table, as the place is small.  We always prefer to get our food to go."}
{"text":"I like that Red Oak is dedicated to organic food and eating healthy, but the food is just hit or miss. It really depends what you get. I had a chicken wrap with hummus that was very lackluster but the blue plate specials are normally pretty solid. The place is normally packed during lunch but if you want to eat well I think it is a solid choice."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I have been eating at this restaurant regularly for about a year. I work nearby and often grab breakfast on the way or stop over for lunch. I typically go here because there aren't any other \"healthy\" restaurants in the area. 

Let's start with the quality- The other day I ordered a sandwich to go with a side of broccoli. When I opened my tin after leaving I found a SINGLE piece of broccoli. ONE. I once ordered a salad to go for 9.50 and it was nothing more than a handful of bagged lettuce with a piece of bread on top. I once ordered a poached egg 
\"to-go\" and after over 25 minutes of waiting they explained to me that the water wouldn't boil and that it would be just a little bit longer. Finally after 30 minutes I asked them to make a different kind of egg, which took them another 10 minutes. 40 minutes in total for a \"to-go\" order. 

Next the taste - Some of their food is reasonable when it comes to taste. Obviously, the more unhealthy the better tasting. The pancakes are very good (hard to screw up), sandwiches slathered in cheese and salads slathered in dressing are good too. If you are looking for something healthy, this is not the place to go. Everything is covered in oil. Eggs always come brown (if they are anything but scrambled) and taste gross, \"healthy salads\" essentially contain no ingredients, vegetable sides are more oil than vegetable, and vegan or vegetarian sandwiches taste like nothing unless they put hummus on it (which is their best-tasting item on the menu). 

Lastly, let's get to what put me over the edge today - their service quality. Firstly, I should say that they are INCREDIBLY slow regardless of time of day that you visit. Don't come here intending to get anything \"to-go\" if you really have to go. Anyway, this morning, I went in to order an oatmeal (which is just rolled oats heated with some water). This is something I do often. For God knows what reason, it takes them between 10-15 minutes to make a \"to-go\" oatmeal every time. They didn't have any bananas today, so I decided that while I was waiting I would go across the street to buy a banana for my oatmeal. This took about 3 minutes. Apparently, the guy working the register (who has never once been friendly to me and always seems to act as if I've killed his cat at one point or another) was upset that I left for 3 minutes. When my oatmeal came out about 5 minutes later, I left, took it to my office, and popped it open, only to taste it and find that he had put a large quantity of salt in there. Apparently I made him mad by leaving for 3 minutes while they took 10 minutes to make my oatmeal, and he decided to punish me. I was willing to put up with everything else until now, but I think this was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

The one good thing about this restaurant is that the owner is very nice. He seems to care about his customers, but he doesn't seem to care about the quality of fake-healthy food he feeds them. 

My conclusions are:

Go here if: you have a lot of time to spare, you don't mind eating something fake-healthy or unhealthy, you don't mind overpaying for food, and if you're not that hungry so you have time to wait for your food to come out. 

Do not go here if: you are in a hurry, you want something actually nutritious, you want cheap food, or you want a lot of food."}
{"text":"Good heathy food. But, staff is slow to make your food even if not crowded. I have had to leave twice without my food in past year because it took them more than 25-30 min to process my order. If you're in hurry, skip this place, walk across street and grab chipotle instead."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat lunch as a student at Pitt.  I wish there was a place this good near my work place.  All of the sandwiches and wraps are delicious, and some of my favorites are the turkey mesquite and the grilled gouda and tomato.  The homemade chips are great, and they have really good, healthy sides for your sandwiches (the green beans are the best I've ever eaten).  

The prices are really reasonable, and the restaurant is clean and bright, though a bit hectic at times. I do wish they had more soup options, though. I've never had the breakfast items, but they have a large selection of breakfast foods on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Oakland. They offer really good vegetarian options and the salads are huge and delicious. It gets really busy at lunch time and can be tough to find a place to sit down but it's worth it. I often get the red pepper hummus and veggie wrap and I like that depending on the day, the vegetables inside are slightly different and it's always yummy."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, but worth it in my opinion. I love coming here for breakfast. Their smoothies are amazing! My faves are the Carnegie breakfast sandwich and their banana pancakes. I usually go early in the morning (around 7:30) because there are fewer people. If you go around lunch (11:30-1) then I wish you good luck. It gets SUPER crowded, and their service is already pretty slow to begin with."}
{"text":"Got the Melvin with Brussel sprout hash and lemonade. The Melvin really tasted like a ruben, awesome meatless option. The hash was a satisfying tasty healthy option. The lemonade was pretty good as well, very similar to the lemonade at Panera Bread. Overall food quality is above average. A great place for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"A diverse and unique selection of dishes for a decent price. Has my highest recommendation, especially for vegetarians, vegans, and anyone who values their food sources and wants only the freshest and best ingredients grown locally when possible.

The restaraunt has a great appearance and atmosphere. It's always well-kept and the employees are very bright and happy to service. The food is absolutely delicious and their menu will have you trying new things and leaving with new favorites everytime you visit.

The best part? The food is FRESH! For real! The eggs come from free-range local chickens and their vegetarian and vegan selection is among the best I've seen. There's something for omnivores (like me) as well. :)

Any downsides? The restaraunt is often packed at lunch and it can be difficult to find a seat, so I wouldn't recommend taking groups or children during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Red Oak is hands down the best place to eat healthy in Oakland. The owner is super nice and devoted to creating a great experience. The food is simply grown, but quite innovative. Try the OTY, a Red Oak classic, for an amazing health snack or early morning pick up. :)"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that there's a local, healthier option to be had amid the strip of Forbes in Oakland that offers a lot of decadent, fatty foods (you won't be hard-pressed to find chicken wings, oversize sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and fries in an area that caters to undergrads). Even so, Red Oak Cafe isn't exactly oozing with purity, either. There are still plenty of meat options, from sandwich fillers to toppings on salads, and cheese is a welcome paring with three quarters of the items on their menu. At the risk of sounding unnecessarily whiny, I'm bringing this up because they seem to take pride in their \"healthy\" menu and use it as a marketing tool, and I think it's fair to share varying opinions on what constitutes \"healthy.\" I'm not saying a little meat and cheese negates healthy eating (everything in moderation!), but I wouldn't pretend I was doing my body a huge favor by eating here, either (if you want to get into healthy, clean, local eating though, run--don't walk--to Eden in Shadyside).

Anyway! I think the breakfast menu, particularly when it comes to the egg sandwiches, is very reasonably priced ($2.95-$4.75). I've had the Michelangelo (egg, mushrooms, spinach, provolone, whole grain bread, $4.50), and it was very good. Their vegetarian chili (with house chips and avocado dressing, 8 oz. for $4.25) was good, but I've definitely had better.

After a couple of satisfied trips in, I was in the mood to try one of their salads, and opted for a mesclun and romaine-based mix (I'm pretty sure it was the California Turkey, with mesquite turkey, avocado, carrots, tomatoes, radish, tortilla strips, honey lime cilantro vinaigrette, $7.50). One of the few things I'm really picky about with food is salad green quality (I prefer dark greens and generally think that any leafy \"green\" that appears yellowish or white is a cheap, bottom-of-the barrel cop out), and I was disappointed in theirs. It seemed much heavier on the romaine than the mesclun, and the romaine looked pretty devoid of color, making it an overall unappetizing salad. I would be very hesitant to get a salad there again.

While the service there has generally been friendly, it seems like the staff might be spread a little thin. Lunch time there is crazy, but I've also been there at off-peak times and it's taken 20 minutes to receive my order, and once, they forgot about my order altogether. Overall, though, enough of the food that I've vetted there is very good, so I'm inclined to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Oakland! Their smokehouse turkey sandwich is AMAZING and so are the banana nutella pancakes! I can't say enough about this place and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast and lunch. The menu is simple, yet there is impressive healthy choices of entrees. I have been to this place many times, and their salads and sandwiches never fail. -- However, the coffee is tepid, served from a thermos bottle. -- The service is sometimes poor, as the staff seems to be new faces each time I visit. --- To be a totally healthy place, they could ditch the fiberless fruit juices/shakes. Fruit are meant to be eaten not drank."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy options in Oakland. I had the salmon avocado salad which was good. They also have a juice bar. Can be hard to find a table during peak hours because the place is kind of small. But they do take out if needed! 

If you're looking for a place in Oakland for lunch I would go here. All of the rest of the options on Forbes you can get any old day."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast sandwiches. Offers gluten-free bread's. Nice cup of coffee. Great local place to stop if you're not in a big box chains for breakfast"}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting and loved the variety of vegetarian options. I had half veggie hummus wrap and Greek salad. The wrap was amazing just wish it was a bit larger. That being said, my Greek salad made up for it and was huge! Everything was very fresh and yummy. 

Seating was a bit of an issue. My boyfriend and I lucked out and managed to get a seat but other people behind us weren't so lucky. Still worked out though. My boyfriend got the mushroom beef melt and salmon salad and he was impressed with it too. I will go back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Red Oak cafe offers nice vegetarian options at decent prices. However, the food itself wasn't so fantastic, and know that the breakfast sandwiches are pretty small and will not fill you up. Nice atmosphere and staff, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"LOVE the Oatie - and that I can now mix the Oatie and the fruit smoothie.  you drink it and you are literally doing your body a big favor!

The Oatie is a 3x per week item for me.  The flavors change everyday, so you never know what you will get from day-to-day and I like it that way!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. An okay spot for a quick bite (especially if you're a broke college student) but I wouldn't come back here.

Went here with two friends: one of them and I got egg sandwiches, which were okay. Nothing to write home about. My other friend got an egg scramble, was also decent, but the potatoes were cold and undercooked.

We also got a smoothie and juice, and the staff forgot about it. Had to go up to remind them, and a second time because the juice wasn't ready during the first trip."}
{"text":"Red Oak is a great alternative compared to the other food in Oakland, for a great price. The food is much healthier than most Oakland options, and has a variety of options. They also offer breakfast all day long. Service isn't fabulous during lunch rush, but I have never had a problem. Their smoothies and juices are excellent!"}
{"text":"A great place for a healthy lunch!  You can get lunch for a decent price (~$10.00) The buffalo chicken wrap is TO DIE FOR.  It's a nice place with good and healthy choices for lunch...a real gem in a land of McDonald's and fast food."}
{"text":"The food is healthy, filling, and vegetarian/vegan friendly.  They can cater to gluten free as well.   I enjoy the vegetarian spins on popular sandwiches (e.g the Melvin instead of a Reuben).  The owner goes out of his way to introduce himself and offer samples of new menu items.  The staff are often very busy, but will smile and accommodate your concerns/questions/requests."}
{"text":"Poorly organized. Very long wait. All 4 staff hoped someone else would know what to do when chili was dried out and gross. Odd, cold cooked carrots for side veggie. Beef sandwich average. 3 of us left hungry."}
{"text":"First of all they ARE open Sundays.  Yelp says it's closed.

This is a tasty diner type atmosphere with great pancakes, coffee, and fresh juices.  I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best if not the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It has very unusual, tasty and healthy choices.  One of my favorite dishes is the salmon avocado salad, perhaps the best salad that I have ever eaten and very different from any other salad.  I also love their sleek wrap.  Other excellent choices are the red pepper hummus wrap, the melvin sandwich, the veggie burgher and many many others.  The best fish tacos that I have ever eaten are served for lunch every Friday in their blue plate special; I love that dish and the accompanying corn rice salad both eaten with lemon which is supplied on request.  I work in Oakland and am almost never disappointed by the Red Oak."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I've had this placed bookmarked for almost a year and am kicking myself for waiting so long to go!  The food was fresh, with unique flavor combinations that tasted fantastic!!  Highly recommend visiting here. I had the 1/2 beef mushroom melt and 1/2 beet goat cheese salad. So good!"}
{"text":"After previous bad experiences at Red Oak I'd stopped going there for a few months.  Today I decided to give them a second try, hoping maybe the staff had changed over enough for them to have improved.  Boy was I wrong!  I ordered 2 salads, both of which came with old lettuce (a few pieces of romaine were red throughout the stem) and mine had a few rotten tomatoes (one was black for half of it).  The final straw? While eating his Ceasar salad my friend cut his mouth on a sharp, hard piece of plastic. 

I called before walking back to the store and the guy on the phone said they would be willing to make things better.  When I got back to the restaurant the manager walked up, pulled $7 out of the drawer, threw it at me and said, \"have a good day\" without even asking me what was actually wrong or trying to see what the problem was.  

My question to Red Oak after reading all the bad reviews here:  How do you expect to make things better if you won't even listen to what is wrong?"}
{"text":"Burned once, shame on them.  Burned twice, shame on me......it goes something like that, right?  I eat here fairly regularly and I have noticed that the quality can be inconsistent when I get a takeout order.  Overall, though, I am usually happy with my food.  But, I have now two years in a row ordered the blue plate special during Restaurant Week.  What a deal, a five dollar meal, right?  No.  I noticed last year, and confirmed this year, that they just cut down on the amount of food since the price is reduced a couple dollars.  Fine, offer a smaller portion for five dollars, but at least let the consumer know that that is your strategy and offer a full priced portion as well.  So, I now sit at my desk still slightly hungry after eating my two meager, under-filled fish tacos and ten green beans thinking, had I not bought the blue plate special during a non \"Restaurant Week\" at Red Oak, I probably would not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the shady side scramble and it was extremely salty tasting. They also forgot the avocado and when I asked for some, I was handed a couple slices of completely brown avocado. My boyfriend ordered 3 eggs with toast and a side of bacon. They didn't bring him the toast or bacon and he had to go back up and ask for it. Maybe it was an off day, but I would recommend going somewhere else for breakfast. Their salads however looked* delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. The atmosphere is nice as well as the staff. I got the Ruben with Brussels sprout hash. It was really good but left me a little hungry which is why I am giving this place 4 stars. I don't want to be too hard on the red oak cafe because the food was good and the prices were reasonable. If you are in the area this is a safe place to land for a good meal."}
{"text":"I came back since I had a good experience the last time I went, and I was excited to try a new dish. They advertise that they have vegan options, so I asked them what options they had but the cashier didn't know. She wasn't incredibly helpful either about asking other staff members. 

I just got the Melvin with no dressing and vegan cheese and my sister ordered the pumpkin pancakes. They were good, but my sandwich was probably the size of my hand and I'm am incredibly petite. 

I know asking for vegan food is a lot in Pittsburgh, but making sure your staff is knowledgeable in these situations would be a good idea."}
{"text":"This is only a review of the $5 lunch for restaurant week on Tuesday: Sriracha bowl came out initially with literally an infinitesimal amount of chicken. I decided to give some grace and ask to speak with the manager before posting a review. He ultimately corrected it for me and I went on with life lol. So just beware of these instances during busy restaurant week! 

It was decent after the fix was made. I posted a pic of the meal before it was corrected and afterwards."}
{"text":"Great options if you want healthy food. Great quality, however menu could be updated. Plus they play WYEP and started offering pancakes which are both pluses."}
{"text":"I got the Oak Club and it was one of the best sandwiches I have had in Oakland! It was a very messy to eat but totally worth it (I got it in gluten-free bread)! The only thing that I don't love about this place is that it is usually hard to get a seat but I always manage! 

I loved the fresh pressed juices over the iced tea but both were great!"}
{"text":"Visited this place with 8 folks for breakfast on a Friday morning in June. The owner/ manager was totally sweet! Upon entering, everyone ordered at the counter and then sat at one of the many tables. Lots of wood here, maybe 15 tables or so. Water is serve yourself from the counter, which was actually nice for us since we had water bottles to fill as well. A variety of dishes were ordered, including the banana-nutella pancakes that I went with. Oh man those suckers are good! I loved the pieces of banana inside. I would go back just for those pancakes, but the service was great as well, with the owner taking the time to get to know our group and give us some pointers on things to see near the U of Pittsburgh. Highly recommend this place, especially for those with any kind of special dietary needs- this spot had all kinds of awards on the wall for their vegetarian friendly menu :)"}
{"text":"This place has high reviews so we were excited to grab smoothies and salads on a warm Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of the food. The wonton croutons on Kevin's Asian Salad were stale and our smoothies tasted rather bland. They were out of the dried cranberries for my salad. We also had to ask/remind them to actually make our smoothies 15 minutes after ordering them.  We would try other options before coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot and I love all of their healthy choice options.  The seating is very limited and it can get quite busy during the lunch hour so I recommend getting take out or getting there early to grab a seat.  They serve 2-3 breakfast specials all day and then have options to order soup, salads, and many different wrap/sandwich choices.  They have vegan and vegetarian options. I recommend the mosquite turkey wrap and buffalo chicken wrap. The food is always very fresh and is served quickly. You also can pick from a number of side options. I usually go with the vegetable of the day which in the past has been green beans, carrots or a vegetable medley. You can also choose from their homemade chips, fruit or slaw."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch near Pitt. Lots and lots of great vegetarian and vegan options. I had the beef mushroom melt and it was really great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch stops in Oakland. The food here is fresh, the vegetarian menu is good, and the people serving the food are nice. The owner actually came out to the floor to offer all of the customers free samples of some homemade juices they were trying out. In regards to the food, I usually have the red pepper hummus wrap, which is really good. There are breakfast options that are tasty as well as the soups and chilis (the vegan chili is awesome). I've never gotten one of their salads, but a friend I went with once got the cobb salad and had good things to say about it. I would say the one drawback is that it can be a bit pricey for the amount of food you get (I still can't believe that some of these places sell a sandwich and chips for over 8 bucks), but you know the quality of the food will be good- and you hopefully will be able to sit inside the cool restaurant and make Forbes passersby envious of your scrumptious meal."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place for far too long! I tried the Friday Blue Plate Special of Fish Tacos W/ Avocado Sauce---they were excellent! I can't say enough about the Avocado Sauce as it was full of flavor. The physical space was very open and clean. The service was quick and friendly. I will definitely be returning to try some other Blue Plate Specials."}
{"text":"Love the feel of this place and the fact that they serve healthier food (especially in Pittsburgh, the city of fries-on-everything).

Can't go wrong with what you order, though it would be nice if the portions were a bit bigger for the price. Love the house-made chips and the OTY smoothies (especially the warm ones during Pittsburgh winters).

Definitely a nice change of pace for the typical restaurant goer."}
{"text":"It's a cute and cozy dinning destination for lunch right in the heart of Oakland. The service kind of reminds me of Panera where you order at the counter and then pick up after yourself when you're done. It's a great spot for a casual lunch and the food is quite delicious too. 

I had the fish taco as a part of the special of the day. The entrée came with two fish tacos and a side of rice and beans. The fish tacos had a good balance of vegetable, flavors and fish. The fish was crispy and the vegetable on top was equally crisp. My only complaint was the excessive onions overpowering the other flavors. There was barely enough guacamole on my tacos to taste. The side of rice and beans was the filler. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my dinning experience at Red Oak. I will definitely return again in the future to try other entrees. The service was quick and efficient, and the food good and affordable."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch today. Cute and clean little place.  Very busy. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it out to you. I ordered the salmon avocado salad. It was really good. Next time I want to try the Sriracha wrap. I brought my daughter who is 7.5 months old. She was fussy today so there was the right amount of noise in there to drown her out. I would recommend not bringing a stroller in here."}
{"text":"I am actually very impressed with this place! At first I was very skeptical and did not want to give it a chance, but curiosity got the best of me. I tried one of the blue plate specials and was hooked. Red Oak caters to a variety of individuals Vegans, Vegetarians, and us carnivores :). Great place serves breakfast all day too (YAY).
UPDATE: no more blue plate specials :("}
{"text":"Terrible seating situation. My family and I walked in and there were people standing all over the restaurant between tables because apparently the idea is you just hover over someone until they give up their seats since you seat yourself here. I was in a party of 4 and we had to have two of us at a table for 2 and two of us using half of a table for 4 because two other people were in the other seats.

On top of this horrible seating method, there was no chocolate milk left when I ordered (which isn't really that big a deal it just didn't help with my liking this place), and they also ran out of coffee (which I actually thought was odd..), and there's only 1 unisex bathroom so you have to wait forever for it unless you're the only one in the restaurant that has to go.

It was good enough that if they changed that awful seating method I would definitely reconsider going there again but until then I'm out."}
{"text":"It's a good place for vegans I guess. To be fair, my Reuben sandwich was tasty. But it cost as much as a corned beef or a pastrami sandwich from Primanti's up the street and had maybe 1/4th the meat. The menu items seem to cater to a crowd that eshews traditional lunch fare...as in no fries or chips are available except for some tortilla chips they sprinkle with chili powder. It was the cheapest side at $2, and you get a side with a sandwich, so I got it because, well, I didn't want Brussels sprouts with a Reuben. Or mystery cole slaw. The atmosphere is casual, and the dining room is self seating, but you have to order and then they bring your food. I don't like that, because they have room for tip on the receipt, and then you have to ask yourself, \"am I supposed to tip\" before you even get service and you feel like the cashier is judging you, and really, what service is there? They bring your plate out a maximum 30 feet and they come get it after you leave. Is that worthy of a tip? It really isn't any more than the service you'd expect at a fast food place but there you don't have the tip option on your receipt. I'd give it three stars if they just gave you your food at a pickup counter instead of how they do it. I'd give it more stars if they added fries or chips. I get that they probably don't offer those to set themselves apart from standard casual dining options in the city. But that limitation drives my rating."}
{"text":"I ordered the Caesar salad to go. The salad came out on a regular plate, so I asked for a to-go container. The to-go container given to me could fit maybe 1/2 the salad? I'm not sure why I was given a baby-sized container for a full salad... The menu also indicates \"House Toast\" is included - it did not arrive on my plate. 

Taste: Overall, the salad was ok. 

Pro:
- It was huge - good enough for 2 meals. 
- Lots of chicken

Con: 
- Lacked flavor. More dressing would have been helpful.
- About 1/2 the lettuce consisted of those middle-of-the-lettuce-head-white-crunchy-flavorless pieces. 

I also got the bottled Cranberry juice. The brand they supply is appreciated - all natural, not loaded with sugars & preservatives.

Service: Girl taking my order was very friendly. I did witness a slightly awkward interaction. At ROC, there are a few tables / chairs outside. There were a few restaurant patrons sitting at one of these tables. Around 5:10 the wait staff went outside and asked the diners to leave so they could bring in the table/chairs (Closed at 5:00). Hmmm. Of course I understand the restaurant wanting to close down as quickly as possible - from a customer service perspective, it seemed awkward.

Price: About $10 for the salad and drink. A little pricey for the quality, but average compared to surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Oakland because everything they make is so delicious. I would highly recommend their pancakes. I've also had a few sandwiches there that pleased me just as much. It can get kind of crowded, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Oakland, Red Oak Cafe is one of  my go-to lunch spots. The veggie chili and Korean wrap are my favorite vegetarian menu items. I also really love their smoothies and juices. The staff is always very accommodating and can make any dish vegan. Great place to go with friends, especially if you want to try something new!"}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups. They also serve breakfast although I've never tried it. In general, when I'm in the mood for something on the healthier side, this is near the top of my list in the Oakland area. There are plenty of options available for vegetarians, but also for meat lovers. The restaurant is café style in that you order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Seating gets a bit cramped around lunch hour, but that's just a sign of the quality."}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  I love the salad offerings - they offer a good selection of salads that are always fresh, well-composed, and accompanied by a house-made dressing.  The soups are still bland and usually under-seasoned.  The daily specials are usually pretty good (sometimes under-seasoned) and a decent value.  There still isn't anywhere else in Oakland that you can get what Red Oak offers - and that's the sole reason that I've returned, albeit with far less frequency that I'd like to return.

The reason that I don't go there more often - the reason that I've always hated going to Red Oak Cafe - is the poor management that is reflected in consistently poor service.  Every single time I go there, the service falls short, I usually end up waiting far longer than I should (in the middle of the workday when I have other things to do), and it's irritating to me.  Really irritating.

For example, I went there last week to order a salad for takeout.  After ordering, I stood with three other customers and waited.  An employee (who looked to be a local college student) was carrying on a personal conversation with the cook - less than three feet in front of waiting customers.  After concluding his conversation, he started a new conversation with the cashier - asking whether a prior customer left a tip.  After learning that the customer didn't leave a tip, the worker carried on a multi-minute diatribe insulting the prior customer, and preening himself in front of the growing crowd (who were also waiting for food).  After this, he then had the audacity to ask us what we had ordered (all salads), and then proceeded to quickly throw together out salads - after we had all waited for him to finish his display of unprofessional behavior.  He should have been fired on the spot.

The man who appears to be the owner is frequently scrambling around filling orders and trying to do too much himself - while his lazy and undisciplined college student staff lounges around looking hapless and disinterested.  Every single visit involves one or more displays of thoughtless and unprofessional behavior: the cutlery tray is empty - because someone didn't do his/her job to see that it was filled with clean cutlery; food is left on the takeout countertop while its customer waits because of poor communication with customers; customers wait while workers stand around looking clueless; workers have inappropriate personal conversations in front of customers; food ordered to-go is plated for in-house consumption, etc.  It's a horribly run business.

That's why I'm done with the Red Oak Cafe.  It's too bad.  I makes me wish that someone with better management skills would open another cafe to directly compete with Red Oak in their food offerings .  They'd have me as a loyal regular customer."}
{"text":"Always leave happy whenever I come here. When ever I'm in town (about once a year), I make my stop here for a great breakfast and coffee. Very consistent. Friendly staff. Wish I didn't have to drive 3 hours to get here."}
{"text":"I wish that I would have read my OWN 2 star review for this place before I went back. The bathrooms were gross and unkempt and I struggled to enjoy my meal after encountering such poor cleanliness in the restroom.

I ordered a veggie taco salad and the menu descriptions did not represent the salad that I was served.  The menu description stated veggie meat and corn of which there was none in my salad.

I asked one of the staff members  about the missing ingredients to which the said that corn may have been removed and that veggie meat stood for \"beans\".  I found that interesting,  since beans and veggie meat were listed as separate items separated by commas on the menu description.  The salad was just okay however I would not dear pay another $10.00 for it again. 

I did not have a great experience and it is doubtful that I will return."}
{"text":"Food is tasty as hell, fast service, lots of vegetarian + vegan options. I always get The Melvin, which is a veg/vegan Reuben sandwich. The person who helped me today told me about their new vegan Thousand Island dressing and it was really good. I just wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Great place in Oakland to get a decent salad. The half size is usually enough for me ($7), although it might be more economical to get the full size for only a dollar or two more and pack it for later. I like the Cobb, it comes with always fresh avocado and an avocado vinaigrette. Beware, it's quite onion-y, so bring gum or avoid close conversations for a few hours after. 

They have a diverse menu of sandwiches and salads, as well as basic breakfast all day. They also have hot food specials, one a day, but I've never tried any. Great place for groups as you order at the counter so you don't have to worry about splitting checks. Just make sure to get here early or send a liaison to grab a big enough table as it gets busy for lunch. You do grab your own water and bus your table at the end.

Only reason I didn't give it five stars is for price, especially in Oakland which is full of $5 eats. Also they can be heavy handed with the dressing so I'll probably ask for light dressing next time."}
{"text":"What did I just eat ??  I know that I ordered a cobb salad, but ewww.  Just ewwww"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  I put this in the deli section but this is so much more than a deli.
- local and organic foods
- daily specials
- salad and sandwich or soup and salad combos
- historic building where the preserved the original murals that are over 50 years old.

My friend suggested this place for lunch - and it was perfect.  I really like to have a salad with a small sandwich and the salad sandwich combo was perfect.  The small salad was just the right size.  I had the Asian chicken salad and it was great - not at all over dressed and not too many friend noodles.

I love that they have rehabed an old bakery that was local owned.  The Red Oak has kept the original murals that were installed in the bakery over 50 years ago.  

They also serve smoothies and a breakfast menu. I am very interested in trying an oatmeal smoothie."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and sister for my moms birthday last week. Overall awesome experience! 

We came around noon and it was packeddddd, I will plan better when coming next time. It's not very large in there and therefore it was quite noisy and crowded. But that was really the only downfall of the experience. 

I ordered a Cobb salad and their smokehouse turkey sandwich on their \"pick two\" combo. I placed my order at the counter, took my number and found a seat. 

The half portion of my salad and sandwich were quite large and satisfying! And for $8.75, you couldn't beat it! Everything was fresh, from the avocados in my salad, to the lettuce and tomato on my sandwich. Everything was tasty and I left feeling very full and satisfied:). The avocado vinaigrette on my Cobb was amazing. It was so refreshing to have a healthy, fresh meal in Oakland! I also tried a few spoonfuls of the cream of mushroom soup my mom ordered... It was packed with flavor! Mhm! 

I am excited to have found this little gem. I plan on returning this week! :) 

(Just a note: after paying, I noticed two receipts on the counter with slashes through the tip area, leaving me here to give the public service announcement to tip! Yes, you aren't ordering with a server... But your meal is still being brought to you. The servers might all run food during lunch in order to deal with the crowds and might split tips. Regardless, just tip, always- when you're being served! :) end rant !)"}
{"text":"One day I came into red oak with a friend. We were having a serious talk, and I was crying. A red oak staff came up and gave me chocolate pretzels on the house to make me smile . Today almost 3 years later, I still remember the kindness of the staff.  I also still remember how much my friends and I LOVED coming here for breakfast and lunch. One of our favorite restaurants in Oakland. Great food that feels really healthy and satisfying. Always walked away feeling fat and happy! Keep up the good work red oak -- you are doing great things, both for our environment and for our bellies :D"}
{"text":"One of the better lunch options in Oakland. Highly recommend the daily blue plate special. The pulled pork sandwich (on weds) and fish tacos (on fri) are first rate. And breakfast option all day are a plus."}
{"text":"I really like Red Oak for a lunch time option in Oakland. It's usually quite busy, but really is worth the crowd for the food. Also, working here it never fails that I run into someone else from the Oakland workforce so it's always a fun space to catch up with people.

The pick-two option is my go-to. I love the Red Beet Salad and the Sriracha Chicken Wrap. Both have great flavor and it is plenty enough food for me for lunch. The portion size of the full salads / wraps is a bit too much for me, so the 1/2 and 1/2 is perfect! They have serve-yourself water stations and I've had hot tea there before, so my drink suggestions are very limited. I have been there with others who have loved the smoothies though.

During restaurant week they offer a $6 blue plate special, which is fantastic -- always a nice summer treat!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwichs made quickly in a nice environment. A good place to go for a quick, solid sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot in Oakland. Very impressive soups and nice environment.
Nutrition? Not necessarily better than other cafes.
OTY? Innovative, but NOT for me!"}
{"text":"My wife had an egg scramble with some brussel sprout mash and bacon, and I had some veggie scramble with avocado.  Both were nutritious and tasty, but since we're so used to over-salted food in Houston, we found the food needed a little extra salt or hot sauce or something.  Once we added those, it was all great.

Portions were generous, the food was hot and fresh.  My wife really enjoyed the bread.

Service was courteous though a touch slow, but we did come at a quiet time, and we only saw two staff.  Next time we're in Oakland, we'll come back and explore the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"Friendly service and vegetarian-friendly options. I had the Michaelangelo breakfast sandwich with a side of grilled veggies (different veggie each day), and another breakfast sandwich on the other day, and all was delicious.

One clerk tried to interest me in the OTY, a oatmeal-and-tea concoction with a sample. It tasted good but the texture wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"Alright, fine.  I'm a huge snob and I don't want french fries on my sandwich (which apparently everyone does with Primanti's across the street).  But Red Oak Cafe, and the later the box of Mike N Ikes, were the two best meals I had while staying in Pittsburgh all week.

Though still greasy, I had a great breakfast sandwich here that really hit the spot.  Looking around, others food choices looked good also and my husband was happy with his turkey sandwich.  The cafe was crowded, so snuggle up close with some strangers and find a seat."}
{"text":"REALLY like this place! Got lunch here, did the soup and grilled cheese combo; the soup was vegetarian chili. (see picture!) Both delicious.

When I first walked in, the girl behind the counter was waiting patiently for my order, so I explained it was my first time there, and I might be a few minutes deciding. Someone in the kitchen must have overheard me, so he came over with a sample of their OTY (pronounced O-TEE) and a pamphlet explaining. Basically it's a warm oatmeal, yogurt, nut, fruit, and tea smoothie. I think it definitely shows the character of a place when someone does that. The OTY was very good as well! Nothing like I've ever had before.

Some people have mentioned that it's a little pricey, I personally don't find so at all. My soup and sandwich combo was only $7.50. Everything tasted SO fresh. 

Tip: parking can be a pain, but it's worth driving in circles a few times. ;)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times and there food is fresh and delicious!  I would recommend the salmon avocado salad and chicken sriracha wrap!  Yumm!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the sriracha chicken wrap with brussel hash. The wrap was fresh and perfectly spicy. The hash was a great unique taste that I definitely want more of. All together lunch was less than $10. Also the environment was casual and there seemed to be some cool drinks on the menu."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and this was the place my U. Pitt colleagues took me for breakfast.  It's a local breakfast and sandwich joint that everyone in the office likes to go to because it's owned and operated by an alum.  And because it's good.

The interior has a hippie/organic feel to it: cozy, and food specials written on slate in a myriad of chalk colors. And I'd like to highlight that the staff here is incredibly friendly and chatty.  And honest.  I was mulling whether or not to get the medium or large coffee and the server informed me that both sizes were the same price. Bam, done.  Large it was.

None of it is anything you haven't seen before, but IT'S ALL DONE REALLY WELL. I was referred to the breakfast sandwiches, all named after someone historic.  I ate the 'Michelangelo': eggs, spinach, provolone and mushrooms on grain bread.  Simple but fantastic.  And the coffee here is good too.  Good food and good coffee at the same place seems to be a rare occurrence these days, like a sasquatch riding a unicorn pulling a sled filled with leprechauns.  When you find a place like this, latch on!  My colleagues also enjoyed their food.  

The only mark agains this place is the ventilation.  As I write this from a coffee shop in Portland, ME, I can still smell the restaurant on my coat.  Please find a way to fix this and I'll pay rent and move in tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great lunch and breakfast spot.  Salads, sandwiches and blue plate specials.  All organic, prepared with care and good sized portions.  OATYs are great breakfast on the run on a cold day.  The grilled cheese is yum-tastic. They also have pre-prepared foods that you an grab and carry out."}
{"text":"A good lunch, but not worth the hype in my opinion. If you're vegan or a hipster you will LOVE this place. They've got lots of options for those folks. My husband loves it here, I just wasn't altogether impressed. The breakfast sandwich with tomato was good but nothing I couldn't make at home. I'd highly recommend going for lunch around 11-11:30- after that it's a student mad house. But worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a college visit. The food and restaurant was fabulous. I loved the chill vibe. It was like a Panera but healthier. The options were amazing!! Great vegetarian options and they were flavorful. I had half the Salmon Avocado Salad and Keen Wa Sleek Wrap. Both were delicious. Our food came quickly with friendly service. They also have juice bar!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Lunch in Oakland.  Being a creature of habit, I tend to order the same thing...but the California turkey salad is so delicious, it's hard to stray!  Freshly sliced turkey (a healthy portion) and sliced avocado sits atop freshly chopped romaine and is garnished with crispy tortilla strips.  All salads are accompanied by their house toast (essentially a large crouton) and delicious salad dressing (cilantro lime for the California turkey).  I've also tried several of their vegan and vegetarian friendly sandwiches and chili (all of which were delicious), but I always end up going back to old faithful, the California Turkey.  Red Oak Cafe also offers daily hot blue plate specials, which I have yet to try, but will be at the top of my agenda at the next visit!  The service is quick and the dishes are inexpensive, which make it a perfect lunch stop during a busy workday. This is an absolute must try for all of you vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but the food was sub-par. Ordered a scramble which was lukewarm. The breakfast potatoes were actually cold. I sent back the plate to make it warmer and the potatoes came back less cold but by no means warm. Hopefully, this feedback will help the line cook improve service for future patrons. 

Even though I'm visiting, I would not return here if visiting Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"I can see why some love red oak, but I can also understand the disliking of it. Some plusses are local, organic food. It's very vegan & vegetarian friendly. The food is average. I'm going to have to try their pancakes next time. 

Some downsides would be the seating. There really isn't too much of it (from Oakland standard with hundreds of college students in walking distance) It really seems larger from the outside. 

So for newcomers (because we were totally lost & confused), you order at the front then they give you a number & serve your food. You grab you own salt packets, (I couldn't find pepper) ketchup & hot sauce bottles as well as your own water. I can see how that's a good thing rather than having bottles on each table.

So again the food was ok..  bobby was feeling under the weather and asked for a suggestion on juices. She suggested the \"ginger\" one & said it has orange juice in it. Sounds refreshing right? She forgot to mention the carrots, which is fine but overpowered the flavor especially when you weren't expecting it. Bobby asked for a side of ice because the juice was warm.. 

What bothered me the most was bussing your own table (atleast I'm assuming that's what you do since the bussing bins are labelled. I wouldn't think the labels would be for the workers.. again I was totally lost) you dump your leftover food in the trash then plates have their own bin, silverware then cups in the 3rd. I ended up getting ketchup all over my hand which brought back terrible memories of being a server lol.

I'll be back to try the pancakes but I'm sure ill be solo dolo. My s/o wasn't very fascinated"}
{"text":"I decided to go here for brunch/lunch today with a couple of friends from the department at Pitt that I work for. Today was probably the busiest I have ever seen Red Oak, but it made me even more excited to try their food for the first time. I ordered the Bach-a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich on a butter croissant, and a hot coffee, although I really wanted to try the banana nutella pancakes. 

The Bach was actually really good for being just a ham and cheese sandwich. Their croissants, as my friend told me, are delicious and I would have been okay with ordering just that! One of friends ordered a Carnegie with sausage and really enjoyed it. I'm excited to try other things here as everything is pretty fairly priced and the staff are friendly. I probably won't come back during prime time for lunch though (we went at 12 noon) because it's gets so crowded."}
{"text":"Salmon Avocado salad was my nonstop jam for like two months.  They also have tons of vegan and vegetarian options, and if my waistline permitted I would eat the vegan reuban every day.

Quick service and atmosphere and a friendly staff.

My only issue is the whole awkward \"you bus your own table\" thing.  You walk to the counter to place your order, pay at the counter, get your number and sit down, then the staff brings your food to you... then you bus your own table?  And I always tip them, which I'm not 100% sure why I'm doing when they're not really waiters.  Just kind of awkward."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here, but when my lab was located on Forbes Ave., we came on occasion for lunch.  My PI was a big fan of the blue plate special at the time (fish with avocado sauce), and I agree that it was pretty good--particularly the sauce, which was super-flavorful and really spruced up the fish, which was quite bland).  This is definitely some of the healthier food you'll find in Oakland, although it will cost you a bit more than at other local places.  While I was a fan of the blue plate special, the salads I've had from here have been just okay.  Then again, I'm not a huge salad person, so perhaps salads have to be really original and delicious to wow me, and, to be honest, I have yet to find that in PGH (other than perhaps at Cure).

My biggest complaint about this place is the seating area.  As others have noted, there aren't many tables, and it can be difficult to snag one if you come in during peak lunch hour.  I'd recommend getting your lunch to go and walking a block or two to the benches near Posvar Hall to eat it--or else taking it back to your desk.  My lab used to come here during non-peak hours to avoid this problem, but at least once, we came later and the blue plate was sold out.  I've come here more than once with a group and we've walked right back out when there was no seating for us.  Overall, an okay option for lunch, esp. if you're looking for something on the healthier side, but assume that you won't be able to be seated if you come during peak hours and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Just a really solid little joint with great quality ingredients, low carb and gluten free options, and a great Pittsburgh vibe. I wish there were more places like this to get crafty sandwiches in the city. Whenever I visit from Seattle, I always want to grab a bite here. 

Try the Carnegie breakfast sandwich or the Sriracha chicken wrap. Also, my sister is a veg and she swears by The Melvin -- a seitan Reuben that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is totally solid. I got a grilled cheese with tomato and it came with a side of unexpectedly good asparagus."}
{"text":"What a delight it was to discover this nice place.  Located In the heart of Oakland, if you are interested in some healthy but approachable and delicious fare, why not give the Red Oak Cafe a try?  I had the hummus wrap and the veggie chili which was very good.  Although the wrap was vegetarian it was actually quite \"meaty\" tasting and really satisfied my hunger.  The owner was very helpful with our rather large group.  The vibe was relaxed and I'll be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Red Oak Cafe for the first time. While their menu looks quite inviting and also their interior seems to be nice, I didn't like the experience that I had here.

I had the Asian chicken salad and a freshly squeezed juice.
Staff seemed generally very unimpressed and bored except of one. But all in all they were quite confused and just couldn't be bothered. My juice arrived quite quickly and yes I really liked it, but there's not much that you can do wrong with juice. I then had to wait ages for my salad and even asked for it 2 times as all of my friends already went halfway through their meal. The portion-size was big, but the taste was missing. It was overly salty and it tasted like someone just poured quite an amount of soy sauce on top. With it came a tiny piece of toasted bread that tasted old. I was basically just trying to eat the chicken to get something for the amount of money that I paid. The pancakes my friends were having seemed to be popular and according to my friends were definitely delicious. But that for me is not enough to go back soon."}
{"text":"Arguably the only place within walking distance to Pitt that serves food that is not wholly unhealthy. The salad is big and has interesting ingredients (not just a heap of iceberg lettuce).

The daily blue plate special is a good deal.

It can get a quite busy during lunch time when classes are in session."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a wide selection of vegetarian (and non-vegetarian) options for breakfast and lunch, and everything is unique and delicious. My favorite sandwich is the Sleek wrap, and their homemade chips are seasoned well and very tasty. The only thing I didn't like as much were their soups- I tried 2 different ones and each one was a little bland. 

Overall, the flavors here are great, they have good vegetarian and good healthy options, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This vegan gives a thumbs up. Friendly staff over the phone and in person. They modified a sandwich for me (adding crispy seitan from the blue plate to a king kong wrap). The king kong wrap with my added seitan was a texture and taste party in my mouth. Wasabi peas, crispy noodles, and delicious seitan. Sandwich name might be a bit oddly chosen, though.

Only in town for a week from NYC, but I have a feeling I'll be back. The prices are reasonable, staff is courteous and helpful, and the food has impressive amounts of  flavor and texture."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwich person, but this place was PACKED at noon on a Friday, so they must have good food.  

I got a grilled cheese, not realizing it was made with tomato slices inside.  I can only imagine they're going for the grilled cheese and tomato soup aspect.  Before I took a bite, I was skeptical. However, it was quite good - the tomato added a little something to the normal boring grilled cheese sandwich.  It wasn't overbearing and added a different texture to something that is so simple that it generally appeals to 5 year-olds.  I hear their smoothies are quite good too, but I did not partake today.  

Overall, very reasonably priced - my whole meal for $5 and some change."}
{"text":"I've only found out about this place this past year. Like the other reviews say, their blue-plate special is definitely worth getting. The portion is sizable compared to the price. The special changes daily and I'm disappointed that classes prevented me from trying all their specials. The only one I've had is their BBQ pulled pork, which also comes with bread, a side of roast potatoes, and a side of vegetables. Their turkey mesquite is also quite good. They spread red pepper hummus on the bread. It comes with a pickle and a side of pita chips. The chips are a bit soggy and oily.

I've never had a problem with seating since I always go after the lunch rush but I can see the restaurant is a bit small and might be hard to accommodate everyone during their busy hours."}
{"text":"stopped in for breakfast. got eggs over easy and pancakes. everything was undercooked, so not a fan and wouldn't suggest this place"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place. And if breakfast isn't your thing, then you have to get the chicken sriracha wrap. Actually, get it no matter that."}
{"text":"The Melvin -- a reuben with \"pickled seitan\" instead of corned beef -- is DEE-LISH. Also, when they forgot my pop order, they gave it to me for free. Sweet food, sweet folks."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Red Oak as it is one of the few healthier options in Oakland. Also, they are very veggie-friendly and I appreciate that even if their seitan isn't the best ever.  I think that everything I have ever had here has been good, but I haven't ever had anything great.

Service can be a little dodgy--the last time I ate here, my two lunch companions finished their salads before mine was delivered even though we all ordered at the same time.  That being said, there is never a long wait even if it's crazy busy--which it often is.

My favorites here are the sleek (kale/quinoa salad side dish) and any fresh juice from the juice bar. Yum!  I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"A very cozy cliche cafe atmosphere is present at Red Oak. The food was made quickly and inexpensive with some of the best quality taste I have had. Breakfast options served all day along with other options with more of a lunch feel. I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is one of my staples. I only go here with a friend and usually run into people I know. It's a great little place for socializing and you have to take a friend in order to get the best bang for your buck. So here's what you should do! One of you order a sandwich (I prefer the Frick) and another should order a helping of the Nutella pancakes. Then you split those suckers in half and chow down on your 1/2 sandwich 1/2 pancake meal you just created and wallow in happiness. It's the perfect helping size and the perfect mix of savory and sweet. I can't attest for anything else (aside from the coffee of course!), because after doing this once, I never had the heart to order anything else and miss out on this concoction! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Get your inner hippy out for a trip to Red Oak.  This place is a diamond in the rough in the midst of a college campus.  It's surrounded by fast food (think McDonalds, burrito joints, wings) and is a breath of healthy fresh air amidst the trans fat factories.

They have a lot of neat options ranging from vegan wraps to grilled cheese sandwiches to tasty salads with lots of healthy and fresh vegetable combinations.  I tried one of their smoothies for the first time - it was beet based and while I'm not one to typically order a shake made with raw beets I rolled the dice and I believe I left a healthier person.  I felt like I earned my Birkenstock sandals.

Red Oak is busy at lunchtime, and when school is in you're going to stand in line and then play musical chairs to get a seat.  The middle of the restaurant hosts a large community style table and the opposite wall is lined with a counter and benches.  There are several four top tables that are very tightly lining the other wall.  This is not my favorite place to sit for lunch - but definitely one of my favorite places to EAT lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians. Its often hard to find places that offer more than one or two options without meat. This place had quite a few, many of them healthy with options like quinoa, kale etc.
I had a smoothie and walnut pancakes, both delicious. 
Some of the other reviews mentioned limited seating. I thought it actually had quite a bit of room. I do see how it could be annoying at certain times of day when the line to order runs through the seating area, but it wasn't bad during my visit.
Will definitely stop here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had lunch there 10/13.  The place was packed.  Good service. Food was ok, not bad but not memorable in any way.  Fair price.  Too many other and better places nearby to go back."}
{"text":"This place is an immensely neutral place to eat. It's very popular, which makes it crowded - although I'm usually able to find a spot to do some work. However, the sandwiches are relatively unspectacular and their definition of \"home fries\" are a few pre-cooked potatoes without any seasoning kept under a heat lamp. It's relatively pricey for a campus spot, but comes off as a DIY tent vacation experience with the open heaps of dirty dishes in the corner and cheap silverware on the tables (without any ketchup)."}
{"text":"Red Oak is always delicious. Whether I get a salad, smoothie, juice, or sandwich I have never been disappointed. (I'm only ever sad when I try and go on Sundays for brunch!) The juices are to die for the the service is always quick and they are very kind here."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Dave always has the freshest ingredients and the staff is so friendly. The best breakfast in Oakland (yes, better than Pamela's)"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for brunch around 11:30am and it was not very crowded. We ordered our food, and sat down at our table. I got my food about 10 minutes later and it was just okay, (the portions were small and the eggs were overcooked); however, my friends had been waiting almost an hour and their food had not been brought out yet. When we went to see what was going on, the hostess clearly could not have cared less about our situation. We then waited another 25 minutes for our food and when it had finally come the order was wrong. All in all it wasn't a very good experience, and we will not be going back.The only reason we decided on the Red Oak Cafe is because Pamela's was packed, I would've rather waited an hour for Pamela's food than go here again."}
{"text":"I had the Vegan Chili and the Smokehouse Turkey Sandwich. Both were great. The Smokehouse Turkey had turkey, Bacon and Gouda cheese on grilled Texas toast with sun dried tomato hummus, lettuce and tomato. A terrific combination. A bowl of the chili on a cold day would hit the spot."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast sandwiches and wraps! I also am a huge fan of the hot OTY (Oats, Tea, and Yogurt) smoothies! I hadn't seen these smoothies anywhere else before and I'm really glad I tried them. The prices are very reasonable and the food is great. I also really like how they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"For breakfast items, Red Oak is great, but do not even bother with the smoothies. I had a cherry flavored OTY and it was quite possibly the most disgusting thing I've put in my mouth (and I'm a college student). I would ordinarily give a lower score, but the breakfast sandwiches and pumpkin pancakes prevent me from doing so.

The atmosphere and color scheme of the restaurant is cozy, which is something I enjoy along with their hot teas. Bottom line, give Red Oak a chance, but if something seems too healthy to be tasty, it probably is."}
{"text":"Favorite (vegan) restaurant in Pittsburgh !! I've tried most of the restaurants here with vegan options and this one is the best so far. I've tried every sandwich and wrap and can never decided which one to get now because they're all so good. My friends who aren't vegan love your sandwiches, salads, and scrambles as well. Great restaurant, you should definitely check it out : )"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my girlfriend and the food was average. They have a delicious sounding menu but it didn't live up to expectations.

I had half a veggie chilli and half avocado chicken salad.  The chilli soup had little flavor and the salad was almost all lettuce and little add ins. 

I will probably give it another try because I here breakfast sandwiches and wraps are very good! 

Overall not too impressed but I will be back!"}
{"text":"The first few times I came here, back in 2012, I was put off by the prices for what seemed to be basic food re-branded as organic, vegan, and all the adjectives I looked down upon as pretentious. After trying more vegetarian options, this place is actually pretty fantastic, as well as helpful for people with dietary preferences and restrictions! Friendly staff, though it depends who your cashier is, and at least when I go there, I typically don't have to wait more than 15 minutes, except for during the peak of lunch hour."}
{"text":"After living in Pittsburgh for 3 years and hearing plenty of raving reviews, I finally decided to come into Red Oak Cafe for breakfast.
I'll start with the pros:
1. The breakfast selection was really nice. I wanted something a little more wholesome today and found a ton of egg sandwiches to fit the bill, but I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their pancakes as a contrast. I was also really excited to see fresh juices and smoothies on the menu: a nice addition to the usual coffee and orange juice found at cafes.
2. My egg sandwich was very good. I got the \"Mary Schenley\" because I was so excited to see sprouted grain bread on the menu. The avocado on my sandwich tasted really ripe and fresh.
3. The atmosphere was very cozy. I made sure to get there before lunch, so I pretty much had my pick of a table, and the cafe was quiet and peaceful.

My one big negative was the service. Everyone who ordered after I did received their food before me. I'm sure it's possible that my sandwich took longer to make than some other orders, but most everyone I saw also ordered an egg sandwich, so I'm not sure why it took so long. And the customer service was awful. During my visit, a young man and woman seemed to be the only employees there working with customers. The young man took my order at the counter, and while he did so he had his elbow on the counter propping up his head like he didn't have the energy to take my order. He mumbled \"what do you want?\" And barely made eye contact with me for the whole transaction. He seemed miserable and really dismissive, not answering any of my questions or \"thank you\"s, and he really made my feel like some kind of nuisance. I've worked in food service for years and know that the quality of customer service is just as important as the quality of the food.  I felt so unwanted here that I am going to be hesitant to return. I'm sure I will, as everyone can have an off day, but I was very disenchanted with my visit."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time for lunch today and it was delicious.  I got the Blue Plate special which was an awesome deal for $5 which was a sausage and chicken jambalaya with cheese grits.  It was delicious, though I have to say being a native of New Orleans that it was not true jambalaya (didn't even have rice!).  It was more like a think gumbo or etouffee (also normally served with rice) but the flavoring was delicious and true to the Cajun style of seasoning.  Most jambalayas are tomato based but this seemed to have more of a roux base and was soupy.  The cheese grits were also fantastic.  All the ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality.  It seemed the grits was supposed to be instead of the more typical rice and it turned out to be a nice combination, although less authentic than the original Cajun version.  The seating area is also very cozy and comfortable and the service was fast and friendly--you order at the counter and they bring it out and ask if you need anything."}
{"text":"They have the best food here. A definite hidden gem in pittsburgh. The Oty's are soooo good. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing. The food is freshly made and good priced. I went here for breakfast and lunch when I stayed in Pittsburgh.They have a big variety on their menu. Very yummy place!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh and healthy food. Smokehouse turkey with side of hash was excellent.  Have brunch, juice bar and smoothies too."}
{"text":"I had an appointment in Oakland and decided to have lunch in the area. I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the smokehouse turkey sandwich. I got a great window seat and could people watch as I ate. The sandwich was good but there was something a little off. I think the range of flavored didn't quite meld together as I thought they would. I would go again to try a different lunch. It gets a lot of business for lunch so it's obvious that the locals love it. They have won local awards for Best Vegan and Best Vegetarian several years in a row."}
{"text":"I work in Oakland and, as many other reviews have mentioned, this is one of the few places where you can get healthy AND tasty food in the area. I often order the Blue Plate and I am rarely disappointed (even when it has something like seitan in it). The staff - even if they ARE University students! - are friendly and I admire the co-owner for rolling up his sleeves and often working alongside his employees. It can get REALLY crowded during lunch. So, I recommend you go at/around 1130a. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Red Oak is a great spot if you are looking for a change in the food that is typically served in Oakland. Red Oak avoids the greasy persona of the surrounding venues and offers a tasteful spin on more nutritious entrees. The restaurant offers daily specials which I am quite a fan of.

Red Oak is very Vegan and Vegetarian friendly. Red Oak also offers a wide selection of sandwiches and wraps; however, given the scarcity of food that is tasteful, healthful, and served in a creative fashion, I reccomend ordering the specials here."}
{"text":"I stopped in Pittsburgh to have lunch. I wanted something healthy and filling; the menu here satisfied those needs. I ended up getting a vegetable hummus tomato wrap with a pickle and home fries. The home fries are a little weird with the wrap, but I'm also a breakfast person so it made sense. Yum.

1. Ambiance

This place was way too busy for my liking. It's already a small building, but being right across from the Pittsburgh campus makes it so busy that it's pretty uncomfortable. As soon as we entered, I was going to suggest we find another place to go eat. It's very healthful food. While looking for places to eat in the area, this seemed like a pretty strong choice because they are one of the only cafes that serves such healthy combinations of food (ignore my home fry choice). However, I would suggest an expansion or a larger building or something. Way too congested for my liking. 

2. Food

Was pretty decent, although I was hungry a couple of hours later. The vegetable/hummus combination was delicious. The home fries... meh. I hated the side choices, so I felt like home fries were the next best choice.

3. The Superfood Smoothie

Just don't get it. The hot mixture looks like mud and the cold version is like a sludgy applesauce. They need to refine it and add something a little bit more enticing. I ended up throwing half of mine out.

Overall, I was itching to hurry up and eat my lunch and leave. The crowd just makes me want to hide and loses it's edgy hipster-vibe, which feels like it was the original intention of the restaurant. I enjoyed my food, but would probably enjoy it more in the early hours of opening, when there are a lot less people around. It's hard to have a conversation when there's so much going on around you."}
{"text":"I got a red pepper hummus wrap with a side of the vegetable of the day (zucchini and squash). The food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly, and, considering the choices in the area, the menu was refreshing and healthy. I hope to come back and try their smoothies soon!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian in Oakland ain't easy, but for a relatively quick (as opposed to table service) meal, Red Oak Cafe hits the spot.  I've found all the vegetarian sandwiches to be tasty (though I fail at eating them neatly--so eat alone or with a friend who you're not too self-conscious around if you get a sandwich).  I usually like vegetable chips, but I'm not a fan of the ones at Red Oak.  Go for the vegetable of the day instead, as the vegetables are tastier (and better for you, too).  The vegetarian bean & grains plate and veg-blue plate special are good, but as another reviewer said, they're not too exciting.

The omnivores I've brought here like this place, too--my mother pronounced her corned beef reuben as one of the best she's ever had (not too shabby for a New Yorker).  

Maybe I hyped up the oatmeal smoothie in my mind too much, but I found it a little too fruity (grape/cranberry-ish?) for me.  Still, not bad for a good-for-you breakfast in a hurry.

Usually I have no complaints about the service, but I did feel awkward when I grabbed a bite to eat here one Friday evening.  The employees were already cleaning the tables even though the place was open for another hour and a half, and chatting really loudly with each other.  I felt rushed.  I guess I can't blame them entirely, as it was a gorgeous day out and it was Friday."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware... I don't eat red meat, and ordered a cup of something the person working called \"vegetarian chili\" on the phone. I referred to it by the same name when I stopped in a few minutes later and ordered it to go, with no correction. Walked back to my office to find a bowl full of mostly meat (with a few carrots/peppers thrown in). Super misleading, and disappointing. I am giving it one star because I did eat in the restaurant once and had a good sandwich. Just don't get anything to go. This is very close to work, and I was excited to find something with healthier options, but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Red Oak is one of the nice restaurants around campus. The menu is quite interesting and different options are available. 

My favorites are the Beef Mushroom Melt which is always available and the Smoked BBQ Pork with Picled Slaw and Roasted Garlic Potatoes from the daily specials which is definitely great. I have also tried their meatless monday special and although it changes it has never disappointed me. But it is a veggie option so don't be looking for meat in it :P

If this is your first time definitely try the fresh juices they have. I love The Beetle. I never thought beetle would make sense in juice before trying it in here. 

The portion of the food is good but you might want to rethink your options if you are too hungry.

Update: They stopped serving the daily specials"}
{"text":"Came here a lot in college so I decided to go on a Saturday for brunch. The portions appear to have gotten smaller. The breakfast potatoes were barely cooked and the girl at the cash register was pretty miserable it seemed. The LA Prima coffee was excellent however"}
{"text":"A nice breakfast café at Forbes Avenue in Oakland district.

Here's all day breakfast as well as salads and sandwiches. The egg dishes are phenomenal as well as the pancakes (which is better than at IHOP or anywhere else).

The servings are large and the prices are okay. I had the Eggscramblers \"Bloomfield\" (which would be more than enough for breakfast) and a small serving of pancakes (! 3! Pieces; i d like to know how big is a normal serving) with a coffee (for an american drip brew, it was quite good) and a natural orange juice for a total amount of $ 14.

The decor is nothing special, but it's very cozy and the employees are super nice. This cafe is definitely on my list during my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I was able to give this place a fair shake on my one visit... I ordered the club sandwich. (boo! hiss!)

All-in-all, though, it was a great experience, and the place looked like a fantastic place to sit with your neighbors and have breakfast or lunch. The club sandwich comes on a croissant, and although mine wasn't particularly well put-together, the flavors were great, and it was pretty filling. I have to give special props to the curried carrot slivers that they offer as a side dish - they were addictive.

My friend had a big salad with lots of goodies, and she seemed pretty satisfied at the end. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I want to try the OTY and other house specialties."}
{"text":"Red Oak is one of the few places in Oakland where it's possible to get healthy food. The wraps and salads are great, the food is locally sourced and organic, and the atmosphere inside is rather cool. It can get busy during the school year, but they're actually rather quick."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once so far, but I had a good salad at a fair price, and I didn't need to wait long for it. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with Pittsburgh-themed photos, maps, and objects. I haven't made it back here yet, but I plan to sometime in the future."}
{"text":"This is a great little lunch spot tucked into a small storefront on Forbes Ave. in Oakland.  Typically busy at lunchtime, but for a reason.  The vegetarian fare is varied and consistently very good.  Prices are reasonable if not particularly low.  Finding a seat can be difficult, and you should be prepared to potentially wait, and to share a table with strangers if you're planning to eat in.  Carry out is also available, food tends to take ~7-10 minutes to come out, depending on what you order.

Sadly, no lunch delivery.  I think they do catering, but with a more limited menu.  I'm unsure as after several attempts to reach someone there who could talk to me about it, I gave up and found another place to order from for our weekly reading group."}
{"text":"Today I experienced what I've been saying drives me crazy about this place. Inconsistency. I ordered the fish tacos, as I do every Friday for lunch. They used different tortillas today that were dry and hard and did not taste very good. Why, oh why! 

The slaw was a little different today, too. No surprises there, as the mango slaw always seems to change. It's always good, though. The avocado sauce was creamy and today I got much more than last week. The fish was the same as always. Delicious. 

The rice salad they serve with the tacos was hot today. Last week it was served chilled. Which is it, red oak? How should it be? I don't know what to expect!

I mean, don't get me wrong, they were still good. I still love this place. But I just wish I knew what I was getting from day to day."}
{"text":"I really like Red Oak Cafe! 

I love all the fresh, healthy and local aspects of their menu. I like the atmosphere and the decor, it's very warm and inviting. I like that Red Oak falls somewhere between \"fast food\" and \"casual dining.\" What I don't like about Red Oak, as many other reviewers have said, is the inconsistency of the food. Don't get me wrong, the food is ALWAYS good, it's just that sometimes it's not what you expect. I usually get the Bach breakfast sandwich, which is egg, ham and swiss cheese served on a buttery croissant.  Sometimes the sandwich is perfect to just pick up and eat on the go and sometimes it's just so messy that you have to knife and fork it. Also sometimes the ham they use tastes different, like maybe it's seasoned differently? 

Another item on the menu that is always a winner is the pancakes. Their pancakes are really good, but the size of them varies greatly. I also love the Southern Chicken Salad (mostly just for the Ranch dressing, I know i'm just your typical yinzer who loves the ranch sauce). All of the sandwiches and salads I've tried over the years have been good. They also have a sandwich for breakfast called the Dippy Dinosaur, so extra points for that. I love Dinos!

I have a weird texture thing when it comes to certain foods/drinks, so sometime the OTY smoothies are a little weird for me, but the flavors are always great. It's a great meal replacement if you don't have time for breakfast on your way to work. 

The staff is always friendly enough and the place is clean. You'll pay a little more than you would at any of the chains nearby for certain items, but it'll be worth it! If you're looking for quality food and don't have time for a traditional sit down restaurant, this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant on Forbes! They have menus by the cash register and you order there. They ask if you're eating in or if take out, and if you dine in you sit down with a number. 

We got the Garfield and Oakland with sourdough bread for each. They gave me white bread but I didn't realize until later it was the wrong bread so I didn't want to ask for new bread. They have fans in the restaurant but I think this affects the food temperature. When I started eating my scramble I noticed it was cold-ish which made it less enjoyable. They give pretty good portions and the prices are very reasonable. 

We also ordered one of the Nutella banana a cakes. Super good! Would definitely recommend I actually wish I got a full order. 

This place is not necessarily a sit down restaurant, the only other service you get is when a sever gives the food. All the utensils, napkins, jelly, water, etc. were available for us to grab at the counter. 

Okay I wasn't sure if we were supposed to put our dishes away or leave them. I feel like they could explain that more just so it helps people who are coming for the first time. 

Overall my meal was very satisfying, and it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yesterday I took my friend to Red Oak for her birthday. Let me say again, if you want to go to Red Oak you better get there before the lunch rush. They get so busy that sometimes it will take forever to just get your food or it being so busy that there is no where to sit. 

I ordered the 1/2 sandwich and salad special. I keep on ordering this and expecting the sandwich part of it to be better. The sandwich is always good but small and the salad is over flowing the plate. There should be a better compromise of half sandwich/salad. I get the half of a sandwich but they usually just give the smaller end of the bread loaf. I feel that the sandwich isn't really as well done because the bread is skinnier and the meat (or fake meat) always just falls off. But maybe that is just me?

I ordered the Green Garden salad -- Spinach & Romaine, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Carrots, Broccoli, Beets, Daikon Radish, Celery, Homemade Croutons, Avocado Vinaigrette. Mostly I love the avocado vinaigrette so this salad is a huge draw for me. The other reason that I ordered it was because I love beets. Sadly, there were no beets in my salad. I looked for them. Tomatoes, yes; cucumbers, yes; carrots, yes; broccoli, yes; radishes, yes; celery, yes; croutons, yes; BUT NO BEETS. It was a sad day. I should have walked it up and asked for a sprinkle of them but I just suffered in silence. The salad was good though. That dressing really makes the entire meal. 

For my sandwich I ordered the Melvin -- Vegetarian Reuben with Pickled Seitan, Sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese, Thousand Island Dressing on Grilled Marble Rye. Reubens are my favorite sandwich. I always order them then I always feel terrible because they are so bad for you. I decided yesterday, \"Adelina, just do it, try out the 'healthier' option.\" I was not disappointed. I am not saying that it tasted exactly like a real Reuben but it was good enough and tasted close enough to not cause a problem. Yum.

I enjoyed my meal, even if it was heavy on the salad. But really, is that so bad?"}
{"text":"The concept of healthier food in Oakland is a good one, but this place doesn't deliver. The portions are small and overpriced. Despite the wonderful taste I always leave hungry."}
{"text":"Usually Red Oak is very busy. I went a little late for lunch and therefore the dining room was not that crowded. I was surprised that for so few patrons, the staff was a bit discombobulated. Having to repeatedly repeat my order. A party of 4 arrived after me and the staff completely messed up their orders. However, my food was very good and offered a very fresh taste to my palette. I loved sitting next to the window and watch people walk past."}
{"text":"We visited Red Oak for brunch on Saturday. Our experience was average at best. I hypothesize that the positive reviews are a result of: 1) the lack of good (tasty/fast/affordable) food in walking distance and 2) the high population of student reviewers. 

Pros:
1. Gluten free bread option for sandwiches. 
2. Healthy options. The fresh avocado on my sandwich was delicious. 
3. The food was solidly executed although nothing caused us to crave a return visit. My Frick sandwich was good, and the Nutella pancakes made my kiddo happy. We both dug the potatoes.

Cons:
1. Lack of value=WAY overpriced. I ordered a side of potatoes because my tiny $6 sandwich was ala carte. $3 of potatoes was 8 tiny slices. My daughter's Nutella pancakes had a minimal coating of Nutella given the $6 price tag. I had an iced tea, and they didn't even bother to fill up my glass all the way. 
2. Dining room was not clean. When tables, counters, and floors are dirty, I can't stop thinking about the condition of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I went back for lunch yesterday to try something I havent tried yet - I really do love the atmosphere of the place and the fact that they food is fresh so I really want to like it - I ordered the Club Sandwich that comes on a croissant with a side of \"sleek\" which is warm seasoned kale with quinoa and beans - I went at 1:30 PM and there were only 2 people seated - I was greeted immediately and sat down next to the window after I ordered - I noticed over a dozen dead bugs on the windowsill right where I set my purse.. I moved it to the seat beside me. A very nice man brought my sandwich within 5 minutes and it was steaming hot (yesss) The sleek side was fantastic, I really did love it, I had to add some salt because it was a bit bland for my taste, but after that I didnt want to stop eating it, I didnt want it to end.. After I unfortunately finished all of my side, I went to bite into the sandwich and everything fell out of the other side.. so I shoved it all back in and then cut it in half to better manage it - It. was. so. messy. turkey and bacon was flying everywhere, mayonnaise all over my face, I used at least 8 napkins. It was really hard to keep together -- That being said.. I didnt even care - It was delicious - A part from the bacon needing to be more crispy (it was soft and stringy. ew) everything tasted amazing. After figuring out how to maneuver it, I didnt even care that it was so messy anymore, I was into it. I will say that this is not the sandwich to eat on a first date, or in front of someone who you care if they see you with mayonnaise dripping down your chin, then again, it tastes so good that I wouldnt even care. The portion size was perfect - Once I was finished, I felt like I needed to wash my face.. haha, but I was definitely satisfied - I literally didnt even finish piling all of my napkins on my plate before the nice guy came back and took my plate away from me, what! amazing! I'm used to walking it up myself. I walked out happy that I decided to try again - I knocked a star off for the dead bugs, the bottom of the croissant was real soggy and the bacon was very gummy/stringy - Other than that, I had a delightful experience."}
{"text":"Sadly for me - my days of Red Oak are over :(
I have been back two times and neither was even remotely as good as the first. I ordered the special of fish tacos once and couldn't even finish the tacos. The fried fish had a weird texture to it that freaked me out. 

Next time, I figured that I couldn't go wrong with my original sriracha wrap!!! It was okay, but not nearly as good as the first one I had. I can't pinpoint what happened these two occasions? But the quality was lacking. And this makes me sad."}
{"text":"Really, really mediocre. Left feeling as if I could have made a better salad AND sandwich. Not enough dressing and the sandwich was really salty (had a pick two--Caesar salad and Texas turkey sandwich). Smoothie was good though, not too sweet didn't have a sugar overload like most places"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and have never been overly impressed. After my most recent visit, I was unfortunately surprised by the poor quality, customer service and cleanliness. I got the Cobb salad. I threw over half of it away as it mainly consisted of yellow romaine. They also forgot hard boiled egg. When I asked for more iced tea from the gentleman who brought out my salad, he told me to go get in line. I asked for a to go cup for my iced tea and was told \"we don't do that\" and tried to charge me for another tea. I had also tipped the gentleman who told me this. While sitting, another patron commented \"this table is disgusting\", and I completely agreed. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in central Oakland that is both tasty and reasonably healthy.  Plus they make a big deal of using sustainably/locally grown foods whenever possible.

I have to disagree with one of the reviewers' disdain for the soup -- the spicy gumbo is pretty good (though I always end up having to add extra hot sauce).  

My personal favorite things about Red Oak include:
1) Newly expanded hours (7 AM-9 PM), so I can usually get food when I'm hungry.
2) Blue plate special is a really good deal. My favorite one is jambalaya, but the pulled pork and the fish are also good.
3) Vegetarian blue plate option (beans + veg + grain) -- usually not terribly exciting, but definitely healthy and tasty in an unassertive way.
4) You can get vegetables as a side dish instead of chips.
5) Oatmeal smoothie should be absolutely disgusting by any standard of reckoning, but it is actually really delicious and can be a meal-substitute in a pinch if you're running really late and have to drink your breakfast out of a straw while you run to class.
6) All the sandwiches and salads are really tasty, and you can get a salad made into a wrap if you want.

The things that kind of annoy me about Red Oak:
1) It gets really crowded over lunchtime, and if the short middle-aged woman who works there thinks you've taken long enough to eat your meal, she will tell you so.  Best times to go are before or after the big lunchtime rush.
2) It's a bit more expensive than the other lunch restaurants in that part of town (but totally worth it, especially when you consider that the food is fresh and good for you, unlike the other restaurants in Oakland)."}
{"text":"Their food is good, and they have plenty of healthy options including an option for a veggie as your side instead of their delicious chips.  I work in Oakland, so it's a good place to stop by and get lunch from with reasonable prices.  I definitely couldn't afford to eat here every day of the week."}
{"text":"I have been to Red Oak Cafe twice in the last two weeks. The first time was hands down great and just to make sure it wasn't a fluke I returned again for lunch. Red Oak Cafe gets insanely busy during peak lunch times and rightfully so. This gem makes home style food in a healthy and affordable way. I've gotten a turkey sandwich and the roasted pepper sandwich with the home made chips. I wish I was eating some right now! Portions are good and you won't leave hungry. Red Oak Cafe is definitely a keeper though street parking can be a pain."}
{"text":"Two words Brussel Hash, so freakin' good! Was with a group of 7 for breakfasts, not the best place for a large party, but we lucked out that the big table was open. Everyone enjoyed their food. I got two eggs overhard w/ rye toast and the aforementioned hash. I would definitely go back on my own to try some of their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food here is sometimes terrific, sometimes meh. The waits at lunch time are staggering- the staff is really wonderful and attentive. Always order the chips- their home mad chips are wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of The Red Oak for years. They consistently provide fast, fresh and delicious food. Their menu has many healthy and vegetarian options. Those with lactose intolerance & who are gluten free can find great meals there as well!

It is a must to go to in Pittsburgh, and those working in Oakland can make it in for lunch breaks. Get the roasted red pepper hummus wrap, it never fails. The sleek & brussel sprout has are also amazing. One of my favorite Pittsburgh spots."}
{"text":"I spent all of my college years at this cafe. Took my girlfriend here for our first date, ate here for breakfast for our 2 year anniversary, and we'll probably come back for our 20 year anniversary. Love the food and service. Pretty sure the owner is the guy behind the counter. He comes around and asks how everything is. Have a conversation with him, he's a cool dude. Love the salmon avocado salad and my gf loves the Mary Schenly egg/toast combo. The only suggestion I have for this place is their chili..it needs a kick of flavor and spice. The juices are also super tasty (beets anything)."}
{"text":"Sorry Pamela's and Chipotle, you ain't got nothing on Red Oak Cafe. They serve breakfast (egg sammies, omelets, pancakes etc), and lunch (sammies, wraps, salads). Every day they offer a Blue Plate Special, a balanced meal for the se price. I recommend Friday's fish tacos. They also serve tea, coffee, fresh pressed juice and smoothies. Service is friendly, food comes out quickly, and the portions are never too small. You must try the salmon avocado salad! The avocado dressing is tangy, spicy, and creamy! I swear I've never craved anything more than this salad. It also has dried cranberries, pecans and feta in it. I want to eat it every day. Although the bathroom needs serious improvement, Red Oak Cafe remains my only go-to for dining out and take out in Oakland during my work shifts."}
{"text":"Decent food. Tad overpriced. Had to write about my most recent experience here. Arrived at 10:45, ordered, waited 30-35 minutes for our food. Three of the three orders were wrong when the food came out. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes but they came out blueberry. I wasn't going to say anything but my GF and her roommate insisted I at least tell the waiter. I told him and he didn't believe me, so he picked up my plate, grabbed a pancake with his hand and tore open the pancake with his bare hand because he didn't believe me. This is not some college student, this was the manager. He saw that they were blueberry and rushed back to the kitchen. Didn't apologize or tell me he was going to make some new pancakes, which I now needed because he grabbed my pancakes with his bare hands. So I went back to the counter and asked for a refund. He did not apologize or try to offer an explanation. He grabbed $7 from the tip jar and said \"Here you are.\" Needless to say, I will not be returning or recommending this establishment to friends."}
{"text":"Unless you enjoy waiting 15 minutes for a cup of juice, don't come here.

Yes, I'm impatient, but it wasn't busy and I just ordered a juice."}
{"text":"I had a half salmon avocado salad...I could barely eat all of it! So good though, I was a little disappointed by the amount of salmon on it, but I guess quality over quantity, right! I like the atmosphere of this little place, it has good vibes! Try and grab a window seat and watch the foot traffic on Forbes Ave!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian. However, I do enjoy the selections at Red Oak. 
I'm giving three stars because while the food is good, it's not \"blow you out of the water\" amazing.
It's a campus eatery that primarily caters to students. I'm in Oakland several times a week and do swing by for a quick bite. With this restaurant I always know what I'm getting as far as quality, taste and consistency."}
{"text":"A staple of the Oakland food scene. It's a great place to get a healthy lunch that doesn't necessarily mean you have to get a salad. They have some very interesting sandwhich options that are both creative and delicious. The seating arrangements/interior decor is reminiscent of a hipster type place you might see in NYC... the plus is that they take credit card!

They have good smoothies.. I also like their mesquite turkey and oak club sandwiches! It's busy during lunch - particularly 12-1pm~"}
{"text":"had the best breakfast sandwich ever! good service, nice decor, only complaint is lack of wifi - but it doesn't matter much"}
{"text":"Awesome tasting, healthy, affordable food. Perfect for lunch in Oakland."}
{"text":"During lunch hour, this place is packed. I ordered the oak club sandwich and was hungry enough to try the highly recommended banana nutella pancakes. The oak club is a croissant sandwich, with ham, turkey, and thin cut bacon. It was a little dry, and wasn't really all that special. The potato side dish was not even seasoned  and lacked any flavor. 2/5

The redeeming quality of this restaurant is probably its breakfast. The banana nutella pancakes was a unique dish. The banana is incorporated inside the pancake itself, and there is a generous amount of nutella on the pancakes. I personally think the pancakes taste better without maple syrup, as it overpowers the nutella. 4/5"}
