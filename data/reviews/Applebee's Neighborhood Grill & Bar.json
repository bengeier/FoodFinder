{"text":"Bad time today. Dirty windows, table sticky, handy payment/menu gadget yucky. Used my fork to enter info.
Food was burned and dry.
Only dark chocolate desserts.
Adios."}
{"text":"Im here at applebees and the server was great but i order of their new special of 3 appetizers and one of them the brisket nacho looked like someone started eating of it. I spoke to the manager and he tells me that its the way they look..... Really!!!! I dont think.... I won't come back here"}
{"text":"First off, let me state that I frequent Applebees mostly with one of my best friends. I generally try to order different things, just for variation.
 My friend and I went to Applebees one night, and our favorite waiter was there, his name was Wade. At this point, we had been coming to this specific Applebees about once a week. Every time we went in, we asked to be seated in Wade's section, just because he was that awesome of a waiter. Then, when my friend and I were celebrating my birthday, Wade was extremely rude when we told him we were celebrating... my friend wanted to embarass the pants off of me, and it was my birthday, so i let her... except, there was no embarassment.
I watched my friend ask Wade to embarass me as much as possible, and we sat at the bar waiting for the embarassment to come... it never did. 
the food was okay, not the greatest. The steak that I ordered was not medium well done as I had requested, but rather well, and I was served with a baked potato instad of mashed potatos. The refills of iced tea were few and far between which just ticked me off more. 
I left that Applebees and have yet to return, and I'm not sure that I want to."}
{"text":"This place simply doesn't cut it.  The food is substandard and the service is a bunch of folks running around like they have no idea what they are doing.  Go someplace else . . any place else.  This truly is not good food."}
{"text":"Eric the GM did a great job on taking care of his people. Good leadership 
Will come back..."}
{"text":"My experience was a good one my family enjoyed it very much,the kids had a good time.the sever was very friendly"}
{"text":"We had a terrific meal and the staff was very attentive and available! Great place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"The food was what I would expect from Applebees & the service was fair, however I checked my credit card a few days later I realized I was overcharged.  I called the manager and was talked down to and shamed for complaining about being charged 1.50 more than my bill.  When I told the manager that it wasn't the dollar amount that mattered it was that my credit card was charged for something I didn't sign for, he was rude and said that he was sending me the dollar fifty what else did I want.  I was not angry when I called but furious when I hung up.  I will never give my business here again, especially when every other chain restaurant is located within 5 miles."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This Applebees doesnt know how to cook a steak. Sent it back twice. Manager did nothing."}
{"text":"Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'd give them no stars at all if I could worst service ever!  I've given this location 2 chances and was treated horribly both times! !!"}
{"text":"Second visit. First time long wait but plenty of open tables. This time I was seated with no waiting. The new drinks were good but my meal took forever to arrive. No forks no knives. Meal was cold. This experience was a $80 slap in the face."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received! I've worked in a restaurant for three years if this kind of thing happened they would've been written up or fired! Took server forever to get drink orders and just as long to get drinks. Appetizer came out cold. And server had food in their mouth while making sure they were warm enough. Food took way longer than should have to come out. Waited for server to pay she was no where to be found. Had to ask a server that was sitting up front on their phone where the host should have been to get our server still didn't come for a while and when they did they smelt of cigarettes and said they thought they showed us to pay on the device left on the table. When leaving host was coming inside from vehicle. Very disappointed used to be a favorite restaurant hadn't been in years won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It was \"ok.\" We got the two for $20 deal. The artichoke dip was good, but not great. The ribs were surprisingly good. We ordered two (SMALL) apple margaritas, and I was stunned upon getting the bill to find that they were almost nine dollars each! A bit ridiculous to me. Our waitress was really not engaging, but the service was prompt."}
{"text":"While I was expecting much because this is Applebee's...this one is definitely below average in service, cleanliness, as well as food and drink quality."}
{"text":"We love this location. They have great staff and yummy food. Very helpful when we called in our order. We arrived before the order was ready, so we went in and sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and attentive. When they brought out the order, they told us that our cheesecake was on the bottom of the bag so it didn't get heated up by the other food. What attention to detail!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at an Applebee's in years and I will never go back to this one again. The mixed drinks were awful and the wine I ordered was fine but when you went to drink it the wine glass smelled musty. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible. I'm surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"One of the place that provides bang for the buck, imo.
I order sirloin steak that includes 2 sides.
1. Food I gave 5 stars. Very tender and juicy sreak. No restaurant come close yo their roasted veggie in term of juiciness, full of flavor and big portion (see photos)
2. Service I gave 5 stars. I got refilled 3 times. Nice server and nice attitude. Note that I was there around 1pm. It was slow. But I had bad service when I was the only customer at other restaurant."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the hostess and greeter,as for the serving of brisket enchiladas,I would have been better off going to taco bell. 40$ waist."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks! The pom martini was sooo good, and everyone was nice. The bartender was super nice and it was happy hour too! Come to this applebees they have stronger pours! ;)"}
{"text":"Me and my roommate have been to this applebees a few times but this last time was pretty bad,  We ordered the green bean chrispers, chicken tenders plate and  the oriental half salad.  Green bean chrispers were very over cooked as well as the chicken tenders to were i couldn't really eat them. the waitress was nice at first and then randomly she walks by sets the check on the table like i had made her mad and walked off with  out a word. Made me feel like a \"get the hell out\" from here. We WERE going to order desert but after that we decided against it. Bad service over cooked food."}
{"text":"Wish there was a way to rate this with no stars after my last experience at this Applebee's.

My wife and I had seen the new TV ads for the 2 for $20 and specifically the cajun-ish entrees that were included in this promotion, so we decided this past weekend to go there for a late lunch (around 3:30 PM) and try them out.

It was probably a really bad omen right from the get-go because when we entered, because when the hostess was walking to seat us, noticed another employee walking in the opposite direction, handed him the menus and told him to seat us. He brought us back to the front and seated us in a different area that the original employee was going to. The booth that he put us in hadn't been cleaned since the last people sitting there had left, so we moved to a table straight across from the booth.

We were the only people in the place, with the exception of two other tables of two people that had already eaten, paid for their meals and were just kibitzing before leaving. So, even though this was in between traditional lunch and dinner services and I'd expect there to be a smaller staff wait staff on hand, no one came to take an order (drink or meal) after sitting there for 20-minutes. I'm a pretty patient person, but that's ridiculous.

So, my wife and I just got up and left. When we were walking out the door, the host said thanks for coming in and I responded, \"we didn't even have anything to eat...\" and then cut myself off and walked out in fear my verbal filter would not work.

After all that, we decided to go to Famous Dave's at San Tan and had a FANTASTIC experience. Was waited on right away and the food was great, which usually is the case there."}
{"text":"Food...good but not fantastic. Portions are adequate for the price.

Ambiance....I'm not a big fan and DONT seat me in those high chairs that only 5 year olds think are cool. Loud at times.

Staff....ummm 600 different people wait on you. Definitely not a fan of this. I never know who to ask help from and inevitably they say hold on let me get your waitress.

Verdict....average meal for an average price."}
{"text":"NO STARS!!!!  This was the worst experience I've ever had at an Applebees!  I always order the chicken won ton tacos for appetizers...and this location served a naked chicken taco with no veggies.  When I asked the server about the missing veggies, she said we ran out of coleslaw.  Instead of telling that to us in the beginning...so we could decide if we still want to order it...they serve it without any mention.  That's pathetic.  So, two of our dinners are supposed to come with slaw...again, no mention.  So, I ask for a side salad to take its place..the server says he'll have to ask the manager...pausing...hoping I would pass it up.  So, I tell him to yes, GO ask your manager.  He makes the decision to get a salad anyway...then smiles at me and said, \"No Charge\"....I told him, it better not be...it shouldn't be charged.  Another dinner was missing its garlic bread...which we had to ask twice for..by then the pasta was 2/3 eaten.  We had to bring our cups to the bar to get refilled....

Seriously, the worst service EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They should be ashamed of themselves.."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY

poor service, but i don't blame the server herself.
my boyfriend and i dined in a few months ago and SO MANY things went wrong. it was a weekday and they were terribly understaffed. it took about 15 minutes for our out-of-breath waitress to come get our drink orders. she was trying her best, however it was clear that she had way too many tables to take care of. an expo took our food out, and my salad had no dressing! nobody was to be found to ask for some dressing... or refills... i kindly asked the host to speak to a manager, and with an attitude he said the manager was too busy to come talk to us. 
mediocre food, but i wouldn't really expect more from an applebees"}
{"text":"I tried to call a order in and called  4 times and I swear phone rang 40 and  50 times each call. What the he'll. Can you not call orders in anymore."}
{"text":"Jesus . So The Waitress Takes our order 20 mins later come & tell me she don't have ribs... by this time I'm irritated so we order something else, something simple chicken fingers & fries . Way too much salt .  Dishes was dirty . I will never go back . Like ever"}
{"text":"I would rate this particular applebees a 3 only because of the good service. If it was based on my food that was placed infront of me it would definatly be rated a 1. My boyfriend and I went out to eat here last Saturday night, we got a table immediatly and our server was right there to get our drink order. He was very fast and very good. However our food was horrible. We each ordered a steak (at about $15.00 a piece) - I ordered mine medium rare and my boyfriend ordered his medium. I honestly think that those steaks were on the grill for not even five full minutes. My boyfriends steak was so so so very much rarer then mine and mine was what can you say almost raw. no where near medium or medium rare. My boyfriends mashed potatoes were eehhhh flavorless i guess you could say, and as for out mixed/seasonal vegetables- well it was just a big stalk of broccolli. I didnt really even eat and we did not dare to send our steaks back although we definatly should have, however I have worked ina restaurant and I know you do not send your steak back to be recooked. Very disappointing experience. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food is reeeeeeeally good and the service  is very fast. We couldn't figure out how to use the computer and they were so nice and helped us immediately. Great staff and manager."}
{"text":"I was just here on ciaa weekend and they had dirty tables everywhere nobody wanted to clean off anything and they said that it would be 15 to 20 minutes but as I'm stand because the place didn't look to crowded it was just dirty and there was someone was doing silverware wasn't even trying to clean off anything I will never come here again on an eventful weekend. I just ended up leaving and going somewhere to eat just straight trifling. Do better on nights like this please."}
{"text":"First time here and waitress named Sam gave terrible service and was a complete bitch, talked to me like I was stupid. Worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"My sister and I  wanted to give this Applebee's another try so for lunch we went there 
I ordered a 9 oz shrimp and steak my sister ordered Bourbon steak It was very average
meal the price for the quality of the food was very high the price for that meal should be 
$9.99 not $17.99. I didn't like it. Don't recommend this place.
Before they had better food I liked it before I will not come here anymore."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I have ever put into my body I wish I could give it 0 stars just yuck!"}
{"text":"Some friends of mine decided to go to Applebee's, we get there and was immediately greeted and was shown to our table. We waited 10 minutes before a waitress even came over to get our beverages..we just decided to put our food order in at the same time.(now that she took forever to get to us..we don't know why she was slow it was 9:30 at night and not that many people in there eating) Meanwhile, we're just sitting there and realized the table itself was not cleaned..we all put our arms and elbows in some sticky stuff! gross! we had to ask the waitress to wipe the table, instead the towel was just given to us!! We were like WHAT! So we had to wipe the table!!! Then about 25 mins later she starts to bring our meal out, I had to ask her for our appetizer...keep in mind our dinner has already arrived and on the table! We had to wait another 5 mins to get our appetizer.. Mozzarella Sticks...that tasted like freezer burn water sticks! The prime rib was over cooked and the mashed potatoes were dry and their asparagus was so thin and greasy! ick! the other dish we order was new york steak with fried shrimp...the steak was tough and the shrimp..there was no shrimp! it was just a ball of overcooked batter, we also order chicken and veggies which the chicken was not cooked and still rare and the veggies were greasy! I order the Roaster Turkey & Bacon on a Chibatta Bread with fries...the fries had so much salt on them it was unbearable to eat and the sandwich..well you get the picture how this is all going! It took her another 15 minutes to check us out!  This was an awful experience...I don't recommend going there even if you are starving and it's the closest place to eat...go somewhere where they actually care about the quality of their customer service not to mention their food! Eating microwave food is better than eating there.
This whole experience just reminded me of the movie \"Waiting\"...."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible ever since me and 11 other friends stepped in. Also did not get served with drink after being seated until 40 minutes later. In addition to that, did not ask for orders until another 30 minutes later. Not to mention, half of the restaurant was empty. It then took another hour to receive only half of our food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Well, I can't comment on the food because after being seated, nobody, I mean nobody bothered to come to my table.  I waited a bit more and then a bit more.  I finally hit the \"call server\" button and the red light started flashing. Surely someone would come over now.... Nope.  Well, I was done waiting so, without so much as a hello or anything to drink or eat, I just got up and left.  Nobody said anything, nobody did anything.

  This was on a Wednesday night at dinner time with the place not very full at all, quite empty actually.  Do yourself a favor and choose another restaurant (or even just a different location)."}
{"text":"If I could give them -50 I would!!!

So it has been a very long time since we have been to one. It was by accident we went, the place we wanted to go to was closed for some reason today.

Have been reading lots online about how they have changed and how good the food is.

Where do I start. The place was dead, first signal we ignored. The inside of the place looked awful, so boring and plain, the awnings were torn up on some of the windows, and it had a weird smell inside.
Then we are seated, the server comes up gets our drinks. Then the app shows up it wasn't bad. Then the food shows up, late. I did order a salad instead of fries with the steak, we did the 2 for $25. My salad showed up with the steak. The steaks were over done, we were hungry so we didn't send them back. 
I didn't eat much of my steak, I ate the tasteless garlic green beans and the salad. 
Then we were ready to bounce, the server disappeared. Had to get someone to find him for us for the check. He brought it, we quickly gave him the check with ccard to get out of there.

Absolutely some of the worst food, and the place was awful looking."}
{"text":"I was at this Applebee's with my fiance and 2 daughter's.  We waited patiently for a waitress or even someone to acknowledge that we were there. No one came... As we were leaving the hostess at the door was told and her only comment was \"Oh I'm sorry.\" But did nothing else. So we came to Chili's were we were seated immediately and our waitress Toni took our order and brought our drinks. I work at a casino and also handicap,  customer service to me is so important. Chili's is by far the better restaurant and just down the street from this messed up restaurant.  I would've gave them NO STARS at all. The sad thing is the manager was right across from us when I complained and she did nothing!"}
{"text":"The server Julia was HORRIBLE!!!  Our server got to us about 5-8 min after we arrived. The app came out burnt sent it back. After returning 2 apps. Finally saw the GM she was awesome and very accomidating and nice. She made it right. That is the only reason it is 2 stars."}
{"text":"Corn Chowder and Basil Tomato soup was exceptional.  Spinach and Grilled Chicken Caesar salad also very tastey.  Awesome service.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"well i am regular and i get what i want when i want all girl good and included the guy. can't be better happy hours to drink. 1.65 bottle budlite
plus thursday and saturday kareoke for free."}
{"text":"When ever I come to this Applebee's it is packed, but I always get great service, I read several of the other reviews and don't know why most are low scored posts.  I know a lot of people that come here on Thursday night for Karaoke and they have many positive things to say about this location, especially some of the staff being very attentive.  Come on those of you out there that love this place, give them there props."}
{"text":"Saw the movie \"Couples Retreat\" for our family movie night and wanted Applebee's lol. 
When we walked in, we were kindly greeted by the Hostess & she advised us that there were 2 parties ahead of us, which took less than 5 mins for us to be seated. Our waiter, Christina, came and took our drinks, which at that time the Bartender happened to walk by and advised me of their new October favorites. I ended up choosing the \"Monster Smash\", which was super yummy, I definitely recommend it. Props to the Bartender . I also ordered the \"Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp\", super delicious, props to the Chef  as well. Rest of the fambam ordered their food and stated it was also yummy. 
As we were getting our food, the place then got super busy, over heard the wait time was 25 mins, just to get their food. The manager was super friendly and even helped Christina and other waiters serve food."}
{"text":"Horrible service from rude and disrespectful employees. Don't waste your time and money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service and drinks, I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Even the manager was NOT helpful"}
{"text":"You get what you get and you don't throw a fit.... But you seriously, why are all Applebee's soooooooo bad?

You used to at least be able to count on them for a cheap happy hour booze & food wise. Not so much any more, there are barely any choices & it's mostly stuff people don't want to drink.

Service was impeccably slow, 45 minutes to get our entrees. Margarita tasted like the kind that comes in those Capri Sun like pouches.  Everything tastes as unfresh as it is. The only saving grace was the French fries were fresh, even if only one sad, lone fry came seasoned. On the upside they have great S&P shakers to fix that."}
{"text":"I go to this Applebee's for Happy Hour... I have gone for dinner, but Happy Hour is definitely my pull.  Either way, it's average... it's Applebee's.  We tend to sit at the bar, but we'll go out of our way to sit in Brandy's section if she's not bar tending!  Brandy is the reason we choose this Applebee's for Happy Hour over some of the many other choices around town."}
{"text":"Beware. Three words to describe my experience: crappy food , desorganized, dirty. Had to wait for what? Tables were empty and I should had seen this as a sign. No greeting no nothing. This girl  came took two menus and told us we had to wait for another waiter to give here the sign to ley her know were to sit us. THE WE'RE PLENTY OF EMPTY SEATS. At last seated. No water , no silverware. The waiter kept passing by and saying she was working on it. Working on what? Melting metal in the kitchen to make our forks and spoons. Very strange. All the waiters looked very sloppy like the place,  dirty and crappy. Our food came after 35 mins al together appetizer and food all cold, all the food. Our soup was frig cold. Horrible. It was a 57.00 slap on the face for the most horrible, salty,  cold and disgusting food I have ever been served. The owners of this place with the sister chain Red Lobster across the street should close both down. They are both disgusting. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"We went there to just get desert. It was delicious but our waiter was a little slow and he wasn't around when it wasn't even busy. I had to look for the waiter after 5-10 mins. Other than that, the desert was great :)"}
{"text":"I hate to do this as Applebee's was my grannies favorite place to go out on the town, granted that was like 15 years ago and the place was in general not bad ( I'm speaking of the entire organization).  Something has seriously changed in that time, I've attempted to eat twice at Applebee's in the past year, once in Florida and once at this location. Both have been inedible.  As you can see from the photo they brought me raw and I mean raw chicken. The health department would close this place if they knew how bad it really is. Once the salad (urp) was placed in front of me at the bar, the bartender disappeared.  I sat for 5 minutes looking around at the plentiful waitstaff in that \"way\" and not one even glanced up. There were 3 tables of customers at 2:30 pm with at least 5 staff huddled around by the pass.  Well except for the waiter sitting at a table eating a burger with a customer. I got up and motioned to one of the not busy servers that I couldn't eat my raw chicken and she smiled and said okay and I left. I've never in my life walked out without even leaving a few bucks for the bartender but he was a contributing factor in this fiasco."}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we walked in the door and asked seating preference. Strawberry margarita was great. Way better than the camelback and central location!"}
{"text":"We stopped here with a friend to get couple of drinks. They have happy hours when beer and cocktails are 4$.
We sat by bar and it was fun! Baristas are really nice and cool girls. We shared some stories and made fun of each other. Good luck girls!"}
{"text":"What an amazing Applebees! From the moment we sat down, everything was fantastic, from the food to the service. Treasure was an awesome server! I highly recommend stopping by, especially if you love frozen mango lemonade ;)"}
{"text":"I would rate this location negative stars! The manager/owner of this location should be very concerned! Restaurant was half empty and the service was the worst we have had in a long time. Listened to the hostess argue about where to sit us and another party. That was awkward! We were told it would be a few minutes since it was really busy. Busy? Half empty restaurant on a Saturday night? We should have walked out at that point because it was all down hill from there. While waiting for the waiter, the booth next to us became frustrated because they never could get their waiter to their table. They had to approach the hostess stand and ask for help. Nothing was done and they simply pointed and said \"oh he is over there I am sure he will come by this way\". For us, we only saw the waiter to order our drinks and food. I had to nurse my soda for fear I wouldn't have anything to drink with my meal. My daughter had no drink during her dinner- not even water. Not to mention my meal came out wrong, but the waiter would not have known since he didn't care to check to make sure we got everything we need. I will never go back to this location. There needs to be some good management involvement to get this place turned around. Half empty restaurant on a Saturday night tells me there are bigger problems or perhaps multiple experiences like mine!"}
{"text":"Gross, bad food, slow service.  I needed a quick bite to eat but didnt want fast food.  Went in for lunch at 12:15.  The place smells awful.  I ordered a BLT and a tomato soup, both of which arrived LOADED with cheese after a long 30 minute wait.  There were hardly any customers.   I took two bites and left.  Food tasted disgusting.  Sandwich was the smallest I've ever seen.  Lukewarm.   Never again.  They should lose their franchise rights."}
{"text":"Went there and was seated immediately. Waited 15 mins for the waitress to come just to take our drink order. The place was empty. Maybe 8 customers between two waitress. Food came out and part of it was cold. Would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"At one point this Applebees deserved the five stars. I came in last night to see some old familiar faces. My first impression. The poor hostess Erica being picked on by new staff members that I haven't even seen a month ago. It seemed like she was about to cry. I remember seeing Vanessa working there before she was pregnant and I remember everyone helping her out because it was the right thing to do. Yesterday we all watched an 8 months pregnant woman, the same Vanessa, cleaning up vomit for a table that left her a 5%, $6 tip... All while the general manager, Susan or what's her name, I have also not seen her there a month ago, sat in the bar talking to the new guy who also seemed to neglect his guests at one point. I hope Vanessa didn't get sick and jeopardize her child's well being after last night. 
I sat in Sabrina's section, which is weird because I haven't seen her not bartend on over a year and now they have people in there that I don't only recognize, but I watched Ted overpour liquor, it took me a long time to get my one beer. The bar looked like absolute shit and people were not enjoying their time while trying to dine. 
I know that Sabrina injured her elbow and ended up having nerve damage at work a couple of months ago. Her doctor, the workmans comp doctor, set up restrictions for her, such as not lifting over 5lbs. I saw her carrying 3 plates that weighed way more than that... She was carrying those plates to someone other servers table. The general manager was walking ahead of her carrying two circle plates that collectively weighed about one third of what Sabrina was carrying. So after Sabrina was injured at work, she was forced to finish working her shift, then she was forced to keep closing and working through pain the next week, until the doctors set the restrictions, after which now all I see is that she is not \"bartending\" but instead serving... And running everyone's food, and expenditure everyone food, and helping the new worthless bartenders ale drinks that they are either too slow to make or they don't know how to. 
Every time I come back to this Applebee's I see the environment get worse, the staff get worse, and all the really incredible servers and bartenders that I have met there through the years leave and get replaced by people who clearly should not be in the industry. I hope apple American looks at their numbers and sees who were the best check average holders and liquor sellers and who had the best guest reviews throughout the full 2014, and then look at who's still there. Hardly anyone. It's truly upsetting how much I liked the Boca Park Applebees, but the fact is there are so many employee rights, and safety violations that it's absolutely ridiculous. I've seen people work 8 hours without a drink or any food. No one helps each other out. Management makes injured and sick people work, aside from Sabrina working with this injury, I remember about 6 months ago she was working through blood poisoning and was getting yelled at and pushed around... And yes they were aware. I hope they close this restaurant down and compensate all of the employees properly. It's so horrible there that the gm was demoted and transferred, and another one who doesn't know her job that well and one who doesn't understand human needs, even less so than any other managers there in the past. I hope corporate sees this, and I hope this company starts treating its employees like human beings. I shouldn't have to frequently see health code violations, apple American standard violations, employee rights violations, employee safety violations, harassment, employees crying, and managers not giving a hand to pregnant and injured employees. You're losing all the people that made Applebee's good and replacing them with horseshit. The restaurant even brings in completely different clientele, I've seen and heard of more walk outs and unreasonable complaints there than I have ever before. Shitty service brings in shitty clientele. Shitty managers bring in shitty servers and drive good ones away, which also brings in turn also brings in shitty clientele, and makes sure that the company loses money in the end. 
I hope everyone has a good day and I hope someone fucking does something about this."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday afternoon. We were seated promptly. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad with the dressing on the side. Food was ready quickly. Everything was very fresh. I really enjoyed the salad. Will order it again when we go there. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place sucks waited 20 mins  never got any service  finally just left.im not hard to please but this place is a joke!!!"}
{"text":"I always have an awesome experience and meal every time I eat at Applebee's! The food, service, and cleanliness are excellent."}
{"text":"So I'm absolutely astounded. I ordered take out from this location last night and let the young man taking my order know that I was using a guest check that was previously issued to me. (Hint) 

He said my order will be ready in 15 minutes and that I should come inside rather than waiting outside as he won't have time to come out....well....OK. 

Upon arrival I go in and wait near the order station at the bar....several servers and other employees see me and make eye contact, smile no assistance. Another customer has now joined me as he too was in his car waiting for an order that never showed up. I have now been inside 10 mins when a server finally says \"someone will be with you in a minute\" and keeps moving. 

The other gentleman finally stops a young lady coming from the kitchen and asked if she  was a manager to which she replied \"no, what's wrong\" and never looked back? 
Well we've been waiting 20 minutes for take out that was ordered 40 minutes ago finally someone shows up and gives the other gentleman his order....ice cream and a Blondie that was surely a mess by now but he left without checking contents. 
After another 5+ minutes someone shows up with my order already bagged up and takes my payment. No apologies for the delay. Nothing. The reason I had a guest credit in the first place was that this location has the worse service I've ever experienced anywhere. UNBELIEVABLE! 

Guess I will have to find somewhere else outside my neighborhood to eat when I don't feel like cooking. I'm all done with this place."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. ....
Food not cooked right, not corrected, service poor...
Management duh !"}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this applebees you will regret every moment of it. If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. Server seemed like she was on drugs. Which whatever I don't care about that but my friends boyfriend ordered a burger and asked for guacamole and when she brought our food out she said thy ran out of it. Later did we find out they don't even have guacamole on there menu. I ordered fish and chips it was horrendous. My friend ordered the beef and potatoes the beef looked like dog food not even close to what beef should look like. Let alone when we asked for the manager just to inform her that the kitchen should put out food that is enjoyable since it is a restaurant. The manager snapped and started yelling. I've worked in a restaurant that holds over 200 people and I have never seen a manager treat a customer such as the manager we have received tonight. I am in amazement. Don't ever go to this applebees you will regret it, it every way possible."}
{"text":"I decided to order some to go from this location the other night. The young lady that took my order was very upbeat! She took my order, repeated it back for confirmation and told me it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. 

I arrived 15 minutes later, my order was ready, I asked for extra condiments which she promptly got out the back and put in my bag. She took my payment and then I was out the door....fast and quick.

No complaints!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with online curbside to go. They don't bother bringing it to you. Fifteen minutes after my order was supposed to be ready and they still hadn't come out, I called. Someone named Lacy assured me they'd be right out with my order. Fifteen minutes later I went inside. The hostess knew what I'd ordered without me saying and then explained that the online orders don't always print out so they'd missed it. Of course she couldn't have known my online order if it had been lost. Brilliant made-up excuse. Fifteen minutes later I finally received my order. It was, of course, cold and rubbery from having sat for 45 minutes after it was done. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is your average sit-down Applebee's restaurant. Nothing wrong with it at all, but nothing special either. Prices are decent and food is decent too, which is why it gets 3/5 stars.

I got the Classic Burger which to my disappointment was rather plain and very average tasting. Even after I spruced it up with lettuce, onions, tomato, ketchup and mustard it was still very bland, I think in part it was because the meat was burned. 

They do have this new lemonade which is really good. It is a strawberry lemonade with real strawberry slices in it. 

I will say that there Boneless Wings are 5/5. GREAT!!! We got an appetizer of mild boneless wings with buffalo sauce and ranch. Delicious wings. Everything else that I tried is average."}
{"text":"Will not come back. No silverware dirty tables. Every person should be fired. Bad service at bar, tables etc. Place was empty & took over an hour and a half. Every table unbussed. Never seen anything like this. I had drag the check from the waitress."}
{"text":"Pretty average trip on a Friday night.  No wait which was nice, or an indicator of just okay dining? Either way...our service was good, maybe overly friendly, but better that than searching for him and he was apologetic for us having to wait for our food longer than expected for a near empty section!  Our appetizer was the way over greasy would never get again Potato Twisters...basically deep fried chips with a greasy dip...just yuck!  I got a cheeseburger that was a little pinker than I like it but tasty overall, he got a skillet of steak, potatoes and onions that was VERY hot and sizzling everywhere...what a mess although the flavor he said was good.  

Not impressed at this visit, but based on previous trips I'd give them another chance...perhaps a different location..."}
{"text":"i went here once and the service was pretty bad, but i thought why not give it another shot... its applebees so i know the food...its a chain. cant all be bad , i thought maybe it was a bad day. NOPE!! The second time i went they left a trainee that had no clue what she was doing and we waited about 20 minutes just for service. we decided to get margaritas and just went to the bar oursleves since this girl was no where to be seen. there was a fly in our drink... ew and our silverware had crusty stuff on it.. double ew. finally she brought our chips and spinach dip. it was so cold and hard from sitting so long , i had it... i asked for a manager and they said they could get our food to go.. i said no cause i had to go to work and if our dip was that gross i could only imagine the rest of it... the manager gave us a voucher only good for that one applebees, so we took it and left. i gave it to my neighbor that im not too fond of...lol. ill go to a different applebees if i do ever go back"}
{"text":"Fourth minutes to close and the doors are locked?  It doesn't take that long to box up some boneless wings?"}

{"text":"BRIEF SUMMARY: AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS

If I could give zero starts, I think I would. I'm from Ohio, which seems to be the Chain-Food capital of America. I love me some Applebees, and can definitely appreciate a trip there every once in a while. The location happens to be about a mile away, so I wish I could say I was happy about that. The first time we went there was an absolute joke. Waited 10 minutes for a table when the restaurant was basically empty, the service was atrocious, and the food was blah. Fast forward a few months, I decided to give it another try and use up a gift card from Christmas .... wish I could say things changed, they definitely did not. Had to wait for a table again when I could see multiple tables available. Our server was very friendly, but he kept forgetting things. He'd say he'd be back with a drink refill, the he'd come back without it (that happened quite a few times). They took my favorite thing (crispy orange chicken bowl) off of the menu, so that almost ruined the trip for me to start with. We got the spinach artichoke dip appetizer (took 40 minutes to come out), I ordered a burger, and my wife got the chicken fajita rollup. The food took about an hour 15 minutes to come out. My burger was meh, too done and dry, and my wife had to ask for the sauce for hers (that was supposed to come on it) and wait 10 minutes for that. AFTER ALL THIS WAITING, you'd think the least they could do is give us a free soda or send the manager out to apologize ... nothing. STAY FAR AWAY."}
{"text":"Party of six for my daughters birthday. She requested to go to Applebee's, Concord Mills. I remember now why I have not been in years. Food was OK, but service was terrible. Had to ask for everything, drink refills, napkins, no salt, pepper, or ketsup on table. Had to wave down waitress for everything. I still tipped, but regrettably. Restaurants in this country now expect you to pay their waitress wages on tips. I am OK with that if they actually earned it and not automatically expect. Last time for Applebee's."}
{"text":"Ok where do I start... 

The table Looks clean but when you put your hands on it . It'sticky...Eww!!

We were seated right away. Offered different places to sit. Not many people in restaurant. It was about 1145 am on Sunday morning.

We placed our orders 
person #1 French onion soup  & Ice Tea
person #2 Bacon Cheese burger  ( No onions ) with Fries and Ice Tea
Person #3  The Brunch Burger ( No Onions & No ketchup ) fries  & Pepsi
Person #4 Burger  ( No Cheese ) fries and Ice Tea

20-30 minutes go bye. We watch people walk in after after us and be serve their food before us and we're still waited for our food. 

When we were finally served we were not served all together.

Person #1 had to wait for no reason
Person #3 Fries were luke warm and egg shells in burger
Person #4 Burger had cheese  ( Even though they specifically asked for no cheese) fries luke warm.
Person #2 Burger was missing they were only given fries

7 minutes later the burger was brought out with NO Bacon.

The waitress accepted responsibility in the delay in our food.  How ever between missing the  bacon on the bacon cheese burger. The waitress said she was going to send the manager over so we could speak with him.  The manager Never came over and spoke with us.... so much for Customer Service. The waitress (christine) is not sole blame for bad service or food. I felt  ignored and purposely over looked by the manager Chris. Who had no problem stopping at other tables but ignoring ours. 

Instead the waitress gave us the bill for the food. Thankfully  minus the charge for person #2 burger.  How ever I still feel slighted or over looked because the manager never made an attempt to check on us or speak to us. The waitress apologized numerous times but her apologies didn't make the food come out any quicker, or stop the missing items. By the time she was attentive to our drink refills we were already upset and they took the path of ignoring us instead of facing the problem face on.

I don't write negative reviews on a regular basis so this is probably the worst one I've ever written. I will never visit this restaurant ever again I do not recommend it to anybody else.  Unless your in to being ignored, over looked or food being served to you not the way you order it!

So rather then throw a fit or demand to be seen and heard I brought my words and opinions here. I am not the type of person to not leave a tip. for $39.00 bill I left a $5.00 tip (Begrudgingly) But followed through by sharing my experience here on Yelp and Facebook."}
{"text":"This chain has about five menu's as well, but I was here for lunch, so you just simply head to the back side of the menu and start picking your combo. Your lunch will either be $7-$9 depending on what combination of items you pick. I think I nailed it with my selection of the chicken cheese penne bake and the chipotle chicken wrap. They are lunch portion sized, but it filled me up quite nicely. The pasta had nice strips of white chicken grilled on top and wasn't overly cheesy while the wrap had enough flavor on its own, but was helped by an orange dipping sauce (chipotle). You can get out of here under $10 for lunch, but the quality all depends on what you pick. Applebee roulette, sometimes it works, many times it doesn't."}
{"text":"Applebees has never really impressed me, but I love their grilled cheese. I was really craving one so I got curbside to go and they gave me the butt of the bread. WTF? I just paid $10 for a sandwich and its half the size because it's the butt as well as being the butt - which was stiff and thick. Gross, I'll be checking my food from now on before I pay. I understand saving money but nobody would want the butt of the bread, consider your guests. They always have extremely slow service inside too. :("}
{"text":"Took a crack at the 2 for $20 menu with yet another date. The bill would have been nice, but she had to order two Long Island Iced teas that were about $9 each. I'm suggesting a 2 for $10 drink menu for this chain. I will give the place credit though as beer (large bud light drafts) are just 3 bucks. The place was pretty packed at 7pm ish when we arrived, but was full empty 90 minutes later as we left. The mozzarella sticks are always a safe bet here and her chienese chicken salad entry looked very average with salad mix and fried chicken topping. The three cheese chicken penne was good initially, but I may have left the leftovers in the car too long and the next day it might not have been a good idea to eat them. Applebees could expand the 2 for $20 with more entree choices as well. Solid waitress, but due to date's selfishnness, bill was $50, new chain record."}
{"text":"Great happy hour 5 dollar and under happy hour food menu from 3-6 & 9- midnight. good drinks as well"}
{"text":"Never asked if we wanted desert or if the food was okay.  Never instructed how to pay (we figured it out). Sat there for another 15 minutes waiting for our itemized receipts.  Only highlight of the experience was the busgirl who kept our drink full."}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar they take better care of you.  Karl and Stevie always make sure I am taken care of.  WE LOVE TO STOP IN BEFORE A MOVIE ACROSS THE STREET!!  Quick in and out with a smile!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was just as good! I had fish & chips. Fish had more flavor than I expected. Also had the spinach artichoke dip. Always good. Our server (Rishad) was professional, warm and friendly. Even the hostess that sat us tonight was friendly and smiled. We shall be returning."}
{"text":"I ate here the day before yesterday with my son and my grandmother. We were the first patrons for the day. My son had the mini cheeseburgers with french fries and my grandmother and I ordered the same dish. Sirloin steak (medium rare) with shrimp, garlic mashed potato's and a side of broccoli. I've decided that I'm going to do a celebrity style point review for this one-enjoy.

Waiter was nice and gave us a lot of attention. (+10points)
Strangely, he never once offered to refill our drinks. (- A gagillon points!!!!! Just kidding. -8points)
Our food came out very quickly. (+7points)
Our steaks came out medium well not medium rare-like we ordered. (-11points)
Everything else on the dish was delicious and flavorful especially the broccoli. (+15 points) **I'm not kidding here the side dishes were excellent I was taken aback by the balance of garlic and other spices in my food. I was bummed I didn't have one of those \"my God!\" portioned sized plates...mmm, okay, onward. 
The dishes were reasonably priced (+8points)
My entire entree was under 550 calories which I guess, is good. (+3points)

I would definitely eat here again, but from what I've read I'm not the first person to experience meat not cooked to what was specified. It would seem all the cooks at this location understand is kinda done and really done. Which, for me, means that I won't go here for steak but I will enjoy Vegetarian dishes or seafood. Also, if you do stop by try the raspberry tea it was really delicious. Oh, and one more thing I don't care to figure out how many points that came out too, so if you want to brush up on your arithmetic...no? Okay."}
{"text":"This is a nice Applebees, service was on the spot, our food was perfect.  The servers took good care of us.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went there with my daughter for lunch. Everyone was nice although our waitress was a little inconsistent in servicing our table. We took a little while to order which may have affected how we were serviced. The food was good and prepared nicely but I did not at first get what I ordered. I ordered a shrimp stir fry dish but it came with steak. Our waitress apologized for the mistake and the manager also came over to the table and apologized. I received a small bowl of grilled shrimp so I had steak and shrimp; but, I only ate the shrimp. My daughter said her food was prepared well and tasted good."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for the Unlimited Soup and Salad. My wife always gets the Santa Fe Salad and usually the Broccoli soup. If it isn't the soup of the day then she will get the French Onion Soup. On occasion she goes for the Corn Chowder Soup. Her only complaint is they serve Pepsi products instead of Coke.  

For me I always get the Oriental Chicken Salad with either the French Onion Soup, or the Corn Chowder.

If you have never been to a Applebee's for their Unlimited Soup and Salad  you should give it a try.  This particular location is clean as one would hope and the staff is attentive as expected. It is a nice place to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood

CUSTOMER SERVICE: The wait service is always friendly and quick.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but it is pretty good and reasonable priced and always a  good value. AMBIENCE: Fun with a very comfortable feel but sometimes it trends a little loud but not so much that it still wouldn't be a good place for dates and casual conversation. CONCLUSION: I can't really think of anything I don't like about the place.  This place is a clean, and trendy. We definitely leave full and happy which is why we come back often."}
{"text":"I had a one time experienced hat was not good but spoke to the Manager Chris  , he is very professional,and I will come back to visit again!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner, and I have to say our waitress was horrific! She did not check on us once, had a very nasty personality and was very rude and snippy to our entire group of 5 and a infant. As we watched all the other servers make rounds and smile and be kind, our waitress had a stone face and her personality sucked! in fact, she did not even tell us her name. I personally had a burger, and  the bun was very burnt and hard. my daughter did not like her meal at all, it was tasteless and bland. We waited 20 minutes to ask about our bill and a box for take home for the dogs. Today, I wake up throwing up with severe stomach pain. Horrible food and service."}
{"text":"The manager Ben greeted us when we walked in and at the end of our dinner he came to our table and introduced himself. Very nice guy and gave us coupons for our next visit. Good customer service"}
{"text":"I think most would agree, the reason for eating at a chain restaurant is \"consistency!\"  Unfortunately, this location doesn't get it.  With them, \"life IS like a box of chocolates...\"  The food is edible to bad, the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it, the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders, your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes, and worst of all - you are either \"Dude or Hon!\"  Stay home!  Don't go!  If you live in the area and need a late night bite, there's a Denny's about one-half mile west on Chandler Blvd.  Yes, I know Denny's isn't the best either - but breakfast for dinner is never bad!"}
{"text":"So I went hear yesterday and had a few issues. First off I ordered Jalapeno Lime Shrimp with extra corn bean salsa. Pretty simple. So when i get my dish my rice is burnt and i got a tiny little side of salsa, so i ask if i could please have more salsa and new rice. She takes my plate, which wasn't necessary and the manager comes over to say they are making a new plate. Which is fine until she asks what was wrong with my rice and i tell her it was burnt. She then says well we microwave our rice so maybe they left it in there too long. Like WHAT?  You're a manager and you're telling me you just microwaved my rice? Ummm not okay."}
{"text":"They should change their name to Crapplebees, because the service is crap and the food is crappy. I don't care for Applebee's, but I got a giftcard here so I had to use it. I think next time even if I had a gift card, I would skip this place and try to sell it to someone for food stamps. Just kidding, maybe. 

After being seated, we waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. I HATE that. Why can't someone come by and say \"Hi, I'm busy and I will be with you shortly.\" I dislike having to look around the restaurant thinking where the hell is this dude? When he finally showed up, we were ready to order.

There was a menu insert that had $10 entrees on it, so we decided to each get a meal from that and also share an appetizer plate. We ordered the crunchy boneIN buffalo wings, and the kobe meatballs for appetizers. The wings were good, but the meatballs weren't, and they were cold in the middle. Kobe my ass! We sent those back and asked for another order of the same wings. Tell me why they brought us boneless BBQ wings to the table? WTF. How hard is it, really? We didn't feel like complaining again so we just ate them. A few minutes later though, the manager brought by the boneIN buffalo wings and we told her they had already given us the bbq ones so we ate those instead. She was a real peach tho, and she told us to keep the buffalo wings anyway. Also, for the inconvenience she took one of the appetizers off the bill AND gave us a small discount on top of that. This is likely the only reason I am giving this place 2 stars.

As far as our lunches, I enjoyed my boyfriends more than mine. The brewhouse chicken was a chicken cutlet sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes with cheese and crispy fried onions. It came with stout gravy which he got on the side. My steak was ok, not very flavorful but cooked perfectly medium. It came with a roasted onion, roasted tomato, roasted potatoes and a ton of stout gravy. The gravy was a little too salty, but it made an otherwise bland dish edible. It's safe to say I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was even worse. Now I know why I don't go to Applebees. My waiter needs to be re-trained on how to do his job. He took our order and that was all he did. He never came back to clean the dirty plates from our table. The first dish I ordered was horrible upon the first bite. So I waited and waited and waited until I finally had to flag down another waitress to help me. She ordered me a new dish, only to order the wrong dish. Then I asked to speak with the manager and I watched him sit at the bar for 10 minutes doing nothing before he decided to come to my table. This was the worst restaurant experience I ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! Took forever to get food, food then came out cold, we asked the manager to fix tv 3 times and it never got fix! The place was dead and it was still slower than molasses."}
{"text":"This place is where other ( good bars) go to die.  Too dark and it always smells like a dirty dish rag.  Bathroom smells like a pig pin."}
{"text":"Applebee's...what can I say? Like all franchises similar to Chili's they serve up your classic dishes and have a variety to choose from that will tickle many their fancy. This location is located in Boca Park...Summerlin so not only is it clean on the inside of the restaurant but also clean in the parking and neighborhood surroundings. The Car side to go is amazing! Another convenient way to get your food fast! It's your typical neighborhood bar/grill, different dishes and so forth. Food is mediocre to delicious but I give it 4 stars for the great servers each time u go to this place."}
{"text":"Today was one of the worst experience I had with apple bees. Came in with my husband and 2 year old son and waited a while to be seated. The hostess was no where to be found to seat us or at least let us know how long the wait was going to be. Remind you, the place wasn't busy and all of the workers just looked at us and didn't say a word. Waited a couple more mins but didn't received any help. Left and went to chilis. Maybe I came in at a wrong time?? I hope the next time I come back I won't be treated like this!"}
{"text":"We have tried this Applebees twice and will never eat here again. The first time the service was horrible and the food was o.k. The second and last time the food was not even edible. I had the chicken tenders and the were over cooked to the point that they were dry and DARK BROWN. I got a very very small amount of fries as if thats all they had left. My girlfriend had the riblets and they were disgusting to the point that she did`nt have more than one bite. when the server came by she did`nt ask how things were. When we asked for the check she asked if we needed a box for the food and when we declined she did`nt ask if there was a problem. If we had`nt had a gift card I would have refused to pay but at that point we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Slow service, mediocre food. The only reason we went was because we had a gift card and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Today's visit was lackluster. The server was inattentive. The chips and salsa were broken pieces of nothing. The garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic whatsoever.  

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Really bad food. Only two stars because the server was nice. Had a featured spicy lime salad and chicken tortilla soup, and it winded up costing me 17$ before tip!"}
{"text":"Took my 9 year old daughter there for lunch yesterday May 20, and the food was absolute garbage, I ordered half a chicken ceaser salad for 8 bucks, it was the size of a side salad, and had 6 pieces of thin sliced chicken in it each the size of a quarter.  My daughter and I jokingly put all of the chicken on a single fork.  This place sucks, and is a total ripoff the way they scam you out of normal portions now.  Too bad the old GM Sherri isn't still working there, she was cool and didn't go for this BS.  Applebees on Chandler, you can lick my butthole."}
{"text":"The Sriracha shrimp was good, sweet potato fries also good  with BBQ bacon ranch, nachos not so good. I ordered the sampler. My guest didn't find anything appealing to order. Service was initially slow my guest was buying me a drink but I already had one and the waitress brought it out right away still. I guess I was suppose to drink it watery, once I finished my first drink."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now and always liked it due to some good service and food, but on our last visit it was a bomb.  Wife's Butcher Meat & Potato sucked and even gave her the runs.  The onion rings weren't even rings but little (I mean LITTLE) circle of miniature onions and crumbs.  The plate was full of mash potato and crumby onion rings and the beef was hard as rock.  I had the stir fry that was made up of rice, broccoli and a little bit of beef chunks that were also hard as rock, plus no stir fry sauce at all.  Don't like eating dry rice period.  Our server was fantastic even though he had tables all over the place which we thought was strange.  It took him a while to get to us after we were seated which is not unusual for this place.  You can sometimes wait up to ten-fifteen minutes to even meet your server, bad for business.  This place is going down hill pretty fast and we think we won't be back."}
{"text":"Bar tenders are very nice, good food and cheep beer. Blue moon on tap, good appitizer"}
{"text":"Waitress was very rude, never introduced herself, never brought us silverware until after we had food and had to ask. Food was ok but the waitress clearly did not want to be there, we had to call another server (a woman with short hair) to get our drinks. our waitress was on her phone in the dining area and was snarky. wouldn't go back to this location because of her. she wouldn't even refill my husbands drink when he placed it at the end of the table (the universal sign for needing another drink right?). We have both been servers, it's not hard to do your job, it's a shame that you have such an uncaring employee."}
{"text":"First time at this Applebee's and most likely, my last. I arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday for lunch and there were about 8 other guests. 

I was greeted/seated right away and Jenn took care of me with all the proper etiquette. The food was the disappointment. 

I ordered the Lunch Combo Signature Special: Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad plus French Onion Soup. It arrived in about five minutes. Hmm, a little too fast?

The soup was decent: it had all the right components such as good broth, onions, big crouton and cheese. Thankfully it wasn't too salty like many places. The salad was awful. It arrived with a stale, tasteless breadstick and the dressing was so scant I actually thought the cook forgot it and had to look under the first layer of lettuce. The chicken was boring and all around, would never recommend the salad."}
{"text":"Not going back.

I used to go here all the time... when I started going here about 2 years ago, the place was great.  Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty.  The waiters were nice and friendly.

Came here last nght with a large party of friends and I was not pleased and that opinion was shared by everybody at my table.

We were crammed in their largest booth... not a problem.  

But it is a problem when someone has to leave for a minute and so you don't want to make everybody move again, so you come back and sit on the end right?  

Waiter didn't like that and had the cojones to ask us to not move seats.

I understand that it's inconvenient for the waiter as far as the check out goes, but I'm sorry, it's not about them.  If you're paying my bill, you can call the shots on where I sit in my booth.  But since you're not, we will figure out who gets what bill especially when all of us have our own separate checks anyway.  We know who got what and we'll help the waiter figure it out because we aren't total assholes... so don't ask us to not move seats when we aren't in chairs.

I had the california shrimp salad... used to be better.  The dressing wasn't that great, a couple tomatos in it weren't as fresh as I felt they should be.

But the kicker... after nobody had had no more than 2 beers and it was clear we had DD's (I was one of them), we were told that they were cutting us off.  Yes, we are loud and have fun and laugh, but isn't that what you're supposed to do???  

Apparently that's not ok with this Applebees.

Bad enough, those of us that were drinking something other than alcoholic didn't get any refills of what we were drinking... 

I'm not going back.  It has just gotten worse and worse there and so they might as well just shut down their bar and make it a family restaurant if they want people to quietly sit and eat their food and not complain about poor service."}
{"text":"We ended up here for lunch one day because we we're tired of the usual places. Soon after we were seated, (in a booth that was too small for our party)  I realized I entered a time warp. The low ceilings and crap covering the walls felt very 90's. I really didn't feel like sharing my salad with an over sized picture of Brandy. They need to update their look just like TGI Fridays has done. Now, on to the food...........It was good enough but boring and typical. My biggest complaint was paying over $2.00 for an iced tea. One single iced tea. The refills were not flowing and the waitress visits were few and far between. So with the ice, it was $2.35 for half of a glass of iced tea. 
When you compare Applebee's prices to other chains like Chili's and Friday's they are much more expensive. Our simple lunch cost more than our last dinner at Chili's."}
{"text":"stopped by mid afternoon  for a small bite and  a glass of wine with a friend. sat in bar and was greeted right away,  ordered a drink then informed bartender of my order. oriental  chicken salad and fries on side. food came out quickly and was okay. nothing special but then again it is applebees. friend arrived ordered drink last time  we saw our server/bartender. granted did not need her but would of been nice to have her stop by and check on us. after an hour finally waved down another server for our bill and found she had not even rang in my friends drink. manager came by and I informed  her she had bartender ring in drink and we paid bill.  overall I was not happy with service nor food."}
{"text":"Slow and inaccurate service. I don't understand how you get orders wrong when there is only a few other customers. And we have gone back 2 other times and it's nearly the same way. I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"A couple years ago, my mom was a given a gift card to @applebees. We never got to use it however because there really is no nearby Applebee's where we live in California. 

Applebees seems to be abundant in Vegas however and so it seemed like the perfect thing to do to bring the gift card on a recent Vegas trip. 

I ate lunch at this Applebee's location with my mom and we got the 2 for $20 deal. This actually turned out to be quite a good deal because it's plenty of food. You get your pick of an appetizer to share an two full sized entrees. 

We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and for our entrees we got the Oriental Chicken Salad and the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. 

The appetizer came out first and was actually best eaten right away. The tortilla chips were fresh, hot and crispy and matched perfectly with the piping hot spinach and artichoke dip. I was happy to see some big chunks of artichoke in there. It was good but after awhile, I could taste that the dip was a bit on the salty side and this could probably be attributed to the cheese. 

My mom and I split our entrees. The Oriental Chicken Salad turned out to be a lot of food. It was very good. The dressing was nice and sweet. Fresh Asian greens tossed in a their Oriental vinaigrette and topped with crispy noodles, almonds and chicken, it was a great salad. You can choose to get crispy chicken or grilled and we chose grilled. 

The three cheese chicken penne turned out to be my least favorite of all the entrees. It was all pasta and barely any chicken. The chicken was just on top and there really wasn't a lot of cheese. It's supposed to have mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan, along with bruschetta, fresh basil and Alfredo sauce. I don't think the ratio of the toppings and the chicken with the pasta was too well done. The whole pasta seemed dry. 

Anyways it was an OK experience here! I'm glad we finally got to use the gift card and it was plenty of food. It lasted us for both lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Um, Applebees, we know you. We know we're getting a semi okay meal and a cold drink. You're familiar with quick service. But when none of those things are right, mama ain't happy."}
{"text":"Third and last time I come here. 
Walked in and was greeted immediately which is a first for here and I thought a good sign. 
No, I was being escorted by the host and mentioned I was going to sit by the bar. Once he heard that he'd walked away without saying a word. Very rude, he could have said something simple like thank you and sit where you want.
Every time I come here there is a funky smell in the building. I thought it was coming from the bar but last (2nd time I was here) I sat away and it smells throughout the building.
I ordered the steak with parmigiana shrimp, it was tasty but very poorly presented. It looked nowhere like the picture in the menu let alone the garlic mashed potatoes were from a box. 
Overall disappointing on many levels. Poor customer service, funky smell and ok food.
Definitely avoid this place there are many other options locally that have better reviews."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight..was told there was a 20 m wait..problem was the restaurant was half empty..literally..so I left and went to Chilis"}
{"text":"It's an Applebee's? The service here is okay, they always have a little managerial/host spat over which of them is going to hold the door open, which annoys me because it's Applebee's. Serve the food a little faster and I can open my own door, thanks.

So: you go here because you want to sit down and it's classier than a fast food joint but not that pricey. Also they serve liquor if that's a priority for your lunching - it usually isn't with me, but I like that the option is open. I think the pick-and-pair lunch menu is a bit of a rip-off because they charge extra for pasta and sandwiches, and really 5.99 for soup/salad is nothing fucking special, you know? You should get the 2 for 20 deal instead: it comes with an appetizer. They do a lot of advertising which has convinced Middle America that they are very affordable but to be honest there are a lot of sit-down luncheon type chains that are in this area that are comparatively priced.

Still if you're jonsing hard for Applebee's, like my mom, this one is a pretty decent Applebee's. It makes her happy when I take her here, even if I don't like it that much. And that's kind of what matters."}
{"text":"There are 2 stars for service. The other 3 were taken away because the value for your money is horrible.
The nice commercial about the take two entres is very misleading. The nice juicy steak in the commercial is just a steak nugget, barely bigger than my thumb! 
For that price you also get a wedge of iceberg lettuce which amounts to 1/8 of a small head of lettuce.
Strangely the \"meal\" is delicious but what exactly on the plate was worth $10.99??
By the way, if you want a real second entre, the price is $11.99.
Was the excess charge for the skillful way the cook kept the nugget from falling through the grill? Maybe it was for the extra char on the nugget? Or maybe the 4 leaves of raw spinach under the nugget?
Find some place else and save your hard earned money."}
{"text":"I am currently here, at Applebee's writing this. First off, I must say our server Yuri is fantastic. However, the chef here needs to find another job, not around food. 3 of us ordered the 2 for $11 Vidalia onion steak combo... two with linguine and one with the Margarita chicken. 1 steak rare, one medium rare, one well done. And a children's steak, well done with applesauce. 

The well done steak was cooked perfectly.
The rare steak was cook a little more than expected.
The medium rare steak was \"blue rare\"... inedible. 
The children's steak was raaaaaare... and came out 5 minutes after the rest of our food.

Sent back the children's and the medium rare.
Children's came back medium, at best.
Medium rare came out, a brand new steak, more rare than the first time. It's like they never even cooked it. Sent back a 2nd time.

Called the manager over, took my entree and my son's entree, the issue dishes, off the bill completely. Everyone was quite apologetic. Our server was OVER apologetic,  it was saccharine. 

Finally, the 3rd time that they brought out my steak, it was charred on the outside.  At least it was cooked on the inside. 

All in all, not a horrible experience, but not as pleasant as past restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this Applebee's I ordered a salad with a very specific dressing.  When my order arrived, they simply did not provide any dressing whatsoever and they at that point proceeded to tell me that my dressing was not available.  Furthermore, they also messed up my dining guest's order.  The staff's response was to act like they didn't really care.  I've been to Applebee's other locations and have never experienced as poor of service as I have from this location."}
{"text":"I work nearby and get sick of fast food for lunch so I go here a couple of times a month at least.  I am starting to wonder why.  At least 50% of the time they mess up my order.  The service is hit and miss.  Today I ordered soup and a grilled cheese to go.  When I got back to work and opened up the bowl of soup it was less than half full of soup!  I had to go back and got a half hearted \"sorry.\"  There was no offer to comp it or give me a free drink or anything.  By the time I got back to work my lunch break was up."}
{"text":"I was considerably impressed with this Applebee's, especially taking into play the fact that I usually can't stand any Applebee's. 

Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. The place is considerably small, but we were seated immediately. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad and he got the appetizer trio or something like that with buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks and pretzel sticks w/ beer cheese. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. Being on their under 500 calories menu, I figures that the Thai shrimp salad was going to be sub-par, however it came out with 14 (I counted) well-seasoned, perfectly cooked and de-veined mini shrimp on top, which in my opinion is a really good deal for $10.99. The dressing was good, and was a nice mixture of spicy and sweet. I felt that they put a little too many pieces of shredded carrots and edamame pieces in it compared to the lettuce, but it wasn't a big deal. My only complaint would be that some of the lettuce wasn't as fresh as it could be and there were a couple of wilted pieces. Overall bill came out to be around $32 which is a tad high in my opinion for an Applebee's but whatever. I can't complain. 

The service is plainly average. Our server was there when she was supposed to be, but there wasn't anything fantastic or above average about her."}
{"text":"Well, after their remodel the place no longer smells like a toilet!

And they did some other things right too.  The food - definitely stepped up at least a notch if not two. I go here for their unlimited soup/ salad combos. They have regular and premium salads(in smaller portions) which are unlimited, and you can swap and try different combos of soups and salads.($5.99 and $7.99 I believe are the prices for the regular salads vs premium salads). Premium gets your the asian salad, spinach bacon and something else. I like they added low-calorie/ more WW friendly items too which are pretty tasty. I tried their jalapeno shrimp grilled plate which was flavorful but not spicy. And I like spicy. So for all the bland people this is probably more aimed for you.  I'd put it as a 1 chilli from Arribas or the baja spicy from Macayo's... doesn't touch los dos though with a pinky though.

The beer is still ice cold, and although they changed their prices recently (they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing) they are still really good for happy hour.  There are a lot of regulars here for happy hour from what I've seen which can get loud.  Overall they've taken a step away from their old drive bar scene and brought it back to a decent place to eat and have a good time."}
{"text":"The service here is lacking. The food is below par at best. I can honestly say this place should be avoided."}
{"text":"Though the service is always cheery, they messed up my order (for the third time) and I had SERIOUS acid reflex (for the first time in my life) because of the \"Cajun Shrimp Pasta\" and I didn't even eat half of it. I am in extreme pain and writing this review at nearly 2 am because I can't sleep. 

I am from Louisiana. Southern food doesn't hurt me. This is painful."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. This is my late night go to place (addiction).
We are always greeted when we first get there. The bartender Michael sometimes has our beverages at the bar before we finish sitting down.
Everyone is friendly and the service is quick.
I am addicted to the wonton tacos, but I have tried many of their new dishes and they are all so good."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at Applebee's so we stopped in honestly because it was late and we didn't want to eat fast food. I usually only order the riblet platter but it's been so long that it's not even on the menu anymore, lol. 

Anyway we ordered the cheeseburger egg rolls and wanton tacos for an appetizer. The tacos always have good flavor but I think they put way too much coleslaw on them which made them a little soggy. The egg rolls were ok. The have new strawberry and Blackberry lemonades and they are delicious! 

For dinner I ordered the full rack of ribs, loaded mashed potatoes, and broccoli. Honestly the riblets tasted much better. The mashed potatoes were flavorless and the broccoli was overcooked but edible. Our server was really nice though and had a great personality. Not in a hurry to return to Applebee's."}
{"text":"In the past we've received good food and service at this location, but yesterday was completely the opposite. Despite not being very busy at 12:45pm, our table of five had to wait for the table to be  bussed before being seated. Our flatware all had dishwasher residue all over it, which was the first sign of things to come. We all had the soup/salad all-you-can-eat special for $6.99. Three of us asked for no bacon on our shrimp salad, but all three were incorrect. The waitress took two of them back and left us with our soup, which I didn't want to start eating because she hadn't yet brought the hot sauce (they only have Tobasco, which in Arizona is pretty stupid) I had requested 10 minutes earlier. Another 10 minutes later she brought the rest of the salads, by which time the others at our table had finished their first rounds. We all had beverages (one cold tea, 2 waters, and 2 coffees) which would have free refills but we had to keep asking for refills instead of being offered. The waitress forgot the lemon that my sister-in-law had requested. The waitress once cleared 4 of our plates but went and served another table before clearing the last of ours ten minutes later. The Santa Fe chicken salad was described in the menu as coming with pico de gallo. My husband had two tiny chopped pieces of tomato in his, I had none. We were there for a total of 65 minutes, to be served nothing but pre-made soups and salads. Strangely, my sister-in-law was served a salad after everyone had said we were ready for the check. I don't think the waitress smiled once. I couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for her, though, as she looked nine months pregnant, and sick with the flu. The food was tasty and a good value, which is the only reason I'm giving more than one star. ALL FIVE OF US had EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA within 5 minutes of finishing our food, even though two of us had ordered completely different soups/salad combinations. Absolutely the WORST experience we've ever had in an Applebee's anywhere."}
{"text":"Towards the end of our meal, the fire alarm went off. The alarm is super loud it made my head hurt. I can tell by the other guests' faces that they are also expecting the staff to do something to stop the alarm. However after 10 minutes, they don't know the code to stop the alarm. I don't think they know the procedure. I don't think I'll come back to this location when an emergency like this happens and no one seems responsible enough to handle it."}
{"text":"My second visit in the last year.  Both experiences were similar: awful.  Tonight, we arrived after my daughter's dance recital, so around 10pm.  Not too crowded, thought it would be a quick place to grab some appetizers.  NOT! Our party of 6 ordered 4 appetizers (3 of which were sample size), 2 house salads, and a kids meal.  30 minutes later, one appetizer came out, said the remainder of the food would be out in about 3 minutes.  10 minutes later, a different server brought the salads out (40 minutes after were seated, just for salads!) but we had no silverware.  Another 5 minutes later, 2 more appetizers and the kids meal came out and we asked for silverware.  Next time the server rolled around, we again asked for silverware, and were told \"I told her to get you some,\" referring to the hostess.  He called across the restaurant to the hostess, who said she didn't have any silverware.  He grumbled and went to find some.  Several minutes later, our last appetizer, and silverware finally arrived.  So almost a full hour before we had our entire meal and utensils to eat it with.  We asked about the 50% off appetizer sign on the table and the dude actually said \"you got here after 9, and that's for after 10 on the weekends.\"  He did finally honor the 50% off the regular appetizer when we basically had to tell him to look at the time on our ticket. . Not completely the server's fault, but the whole experience was horrible.  After two very sub-par visits, my family will NEVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"Service sucked. The hostesses had an argument about how to sit the three of. Waiter took our order and never came back. The ketchup was empty, never got refills on drinks... Rice was dry as hell?
Brian the waiter sucked!
Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Awful. Service was terrible. Only a fee customers yet waited forever and waiter didn't listen or wait for us to finish talking. Food was awful. Soup was luke warm to room temperature and tasted awful. We have eaten at Applebee's before. This was awful. Tomato was crumpled and soggy and shriveled. Spinach dip tasted awful. Too few chips given and they were greasy. No plates were brought to even eat the appetizer. Burger was purple on the inside. Yes, it was purple. Why? Who knows. Second burger was burnt and soggy with grease. Beer was not cold. Please dont ever go here. This applebees is the worst."}
{"text":"I would like to see faster & more accurate service at this location - otherwise I really have nothing bad to say.  Everyone is always friendly, the food is always pretty good but I've had some quality issues with the chicken.  All in all it's a decent family restaurant or place to go with friends for a cheap dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Prices are about what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  The food is always good, and the service is okay. Not spectacular.  They can be a little slow, probably die to the fact they were in the back visiting with each other instead of taking care of their customers.  They are clean, but it smells musty."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one afternoon.  I got the Cowboy burger, and my wife got her usual, the quesadilla burger. We had two servers, Leah and Madison, and both were great. The food came out hot and fresh.  It was pretty standard for an Applebee's in my experience.  The place was clean and the service was fast.  This is definitely a location I would go back to."}
{"text":"So I've eaten as this location several times over the past year and never had an issue until tonight. It appeared that our waitress was covering half of the tables by herself while the other 4 waitresses we saw shared the other half. This on top of having more than 1 table that didn't speak english, making it harder for her to take the orders, could have been alleviated with a better distribution of waitresses. It took us far to long to be served (not our waitresses fault) than it should have. Finding out that there were things on the menu that were no longer being sold was kind of a bummer but not the end of the world. We ordered an appetizer and the kitchen forgot to make it. My wife's salad looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served since the morning and was missing a few of the normal components. My meal was fine but seemed to have been tossed together compared to usual. It seems like service and quality have gone down hill very quickly at this location and it should be addressed immediately. It's Applebees so I'm not expecting what I would at Ruth's Chris, but I always knew what I was getting and was never disappointed until tonight."}
{"text":"2 for $20.00.  Caprese Mozzarella Chicken and artichoke dip.  Omg.  Delicious.  Mellow music, refreshing beverages and great company, makes a great casual night out.  My stomach is full and my heart is content.  Food was slow to come and refills on drinks had to be asked for.  Bummer."}
{"text":"I agree with Brian L. that their service was VERY SLOW and not at all what I am used to from this chain. They did not bring all of the food out at the same time either. The table next to us got three servers to bring all of their food out at the same time.  We got one who was clueless about what we ordered and if it was split up for the kids or if the order was wrong so we had to wait for a long second trip back to get the rest of the food. It was right after all.

The taste of the food did not meet my expectations.  A steak cooked to medium should be only pink in the middle, not red.  Food should be served hot, not cold.  As with any chain or franchise you expect the same level of consistency in service and food quality and when its not met then I feel it is the owner that does not care enough to hire good managers or monitor them.  When this happens, the brand name suffers overall so now I have to be wary of any Applebee's other than the one I usually go to on Ina Rd in Tucson which does serve good food and serves it pretty fast.

You would think Applebee's would be savvy enough to monitor social media reviews and investigate issues but its been three months since Brian L wrote his review so I guess the suits are \"out to lunch\" over at CrackerBarrel."}
{"text":"I had a ball at Applebee's this evening. They also were celebrating and giving honor to veterans. I've been to this location several times before and each time had a fantastic experience. Tonight's fare was Fiesta lime chicken , well-seasoned cheesy kind of dish to just melted in your mouth. Service this evening was on target for the massive amount of crowd that they had. Appreciate Applebee's salute to veterans. I will be back as they also right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I order my steak medium well and it's very \"rare\" (pardon the pun) that I get a steak cooked that way.  It's usually well done at other places.  I consistently get steaks here ordered just the way I ordered. Cooked, with a little bit of pink.  Always flavorful, always tender.  Broccoli that came with it was seasoned deliciously.  This time the mashed potatoes were a little bland, but not worth a mark against this place.  Place is always clean and bathrooms are always clean and well stocked (Tip: Always check the bathroom to see how clean the restaurant is as a whole!).  Manager is awesome.  Makes her rounds to each table when she's working.  Stops and takes the time to chat with us creating that homey feeling.  She actually sat down and spent some time with us at our table one time!  My husband and I love coming here.  We try to be careful with our money and are discouraged when our hard-earned money is spent on sub-standard food.  Always walk away with a great experience!  Thanks staff for all your hard work!"}
{"text":"It's a great thing that this location closed. The service was always horrible and the staff rude. The food was never the correct temperature and their menu options are very limited. I've tried the location MULTIPLE times and each time it was something different to make the experience unwelcoming."}
{"text":"I had a newer server, Brian and he was very attentive. I tried one of their new entrees (Bone in pork chop) with garlic green beans and a delicious pecan encrusted mashed sweet potatoes. The pork chop was great - but there wasn't enough honey apple chutney served with it. The garlic green beans were cooked well but served with too much fluid/water, and the mashed sweet potatoes we good but served Luke warm. Now enter the Manager Debbie who listened to my concerns and made my meal fantastic: she brought more chutney & another \"hot\" serving of the mashed sweet potatoes. With a manager like Debbie to back up her servers and give feedback to the kitchen this location has great potential & made me a happy & satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Not awful, ordered takeout and it was ready quick.  But they were out of the steak I wanted, I got another steak that wasn't too good.  No greeting upon entering.  Just handed me my food and walked away.  So I quietly walked over to the register, paid silently (no \"thank you\" from anyone) and left.  I got not even a smile until the greeter smiled and said thanks when I left.  Perk up people.  A thanks would have been nice.  How are you today maybe.  Silverware of any kind would have been good too."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Applebees on rare occasion.  It has never been any place I sought out.  In this case they had the advantage that they were not a McDonald's or Burger King, and they were open very late.

I had the 7oz sirloin. It was adequate. Nothing special.  A little dry, and a bit gristley.  The mashed potatoes were nice, and the garlic broccoli was fine.

The onion rings were fine.  Nothing special.  The breading was nice, but didn't have much flavor.  The others seemed to like their wings and the pasta dish they had.  I was told \"three stars\" when I asked about them.  But I just can't go to three stars on this one.  You might argue me up to 2.5 stars, but that's not an option on Yelp.

My wife did say the strawberry margarita was good (I didn't drink it).

If you have no choice, this place is OK.  Food is adequate, they have a happy hour, and they are open very late.  One of the better \"last resort\" options around midnight."}
{"text":"Waited several minutes to be greeted and sat.  Server came and took drink orders.  We had 3 shareable apps, pretzel sticks had no salt, looked like they had blisters and were dripping in oil, beer sauce was nice.  Egg rolls were nice too.  I had beef tips on garlic mash with stout gravy.  Was just warm, beef way over cooked and chewy, raw mushrooms which was odd.  Johan had a beef and brisket burger which was dry and paid extra for garlic fries, it was just fries with a plop of garlic on a few fries.
Server checked on food the second it was put down and we didn't see him again till after meal."}
{"text":"Big mistake to go.  The total number of 1 an 2 stars is staggering.  Applebee's should be ashamed of this establishment.  Absolutely the filthiest place I have ever eaten at.  The menus were stuck together with slopped food.  The wrapped silverware had hardened food on it.  The tabletop computer system had food and grease all over it (not just at our table).

The food was terrible.  I had the spicy chicken over mac&cheese.  I do not know the name, as its is not listed on any Applebee online menu.  But, it's the dish on their in-house menu.   Seriously Applebee's - three frozen chicken stips dipped in some kind of spicy sauce from a jar?   The mac&cheese should be just called mac, no cheese flavor what-so-ever.   

The server was great and service was fine.  It is a pity that this place just sucks as bad as it does.  Heed the warnings fellow Yelpaholics!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate this place so much! The smell of burnt fry oil consumes you when you arrive. Then we sat at the bar which smelled even worse and tiny fruit fly's everywhere. If you are reading this and you are the health inspector, please drop in and give this place a much needed wrist slap."}
{"text":"I am surprised to be a fan of Applebee's. My first impressions of Applebee's from many years ago were not good ones. I felt that the portions were small and the food too high priced. Fortunately, with recent visits to 3 different Applebee's locations in Las Vegas, my impressions have changed.

My wife and I have found Applebee's to be surprisingly affordable and delicious. The 2 for $20 specials are a real value! Also, we really enjoyed splitting a bourbon black and blue burger w/ bacon along with an order of chips and artichoke dip. We both have moderate appetites and were filled up after this meal. 

All three locations were very similar with good food and service and we would return to either of them.

...They also have some small but visible televisions for those of us interested in catching a few minutes of a game while we eat."}
{"text":"Greeter & server were very friendly & we were seated promptly. Server was kind while providing good menu suggestions to  help tus make a selection for dinner. Selection items were timely & delicious. I would surely recommend this restaurant to anyone that would desire a good evening out. Thanks to Glenda, our server,"}
{"text":"This place is really fun on karaoke night. Great happy hour specials. Just a all around fun place if you go on the right night."}
{"text":"The food was cold , I asked for lemonade and they gave me sprite, and I asked for a spoon and they never gave it to me."}
{"text":"Had a free lunch there for Veterans day. I forgot how good the food is and how quick the service was. Yes, even for free lunch it was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this Applebee's wondered in here one night looking for a Margarita they have what's called the perfect Margarita and it's really good. The food is great and the people are super friendly. A special shout out to Samantha!!!"}
{"text":"One star because that's the least amount you can leave. I understand they have dollar margaritas but they should have enough people on staff to make all the food and get people seated and fed quickly. We came in restaurant seemed slow. Hostess said 10 minute wait to let the kitchen catch up. Well by the time we where seated the lobby was packed. As soon as we sat down we each ordered a water and a margarita we were a party of two. we place our order for food. That's where things went south. We sat for 45 minutes. The table that sat after us, ate and left before our appetizer ever came. I left a $5 on the table to cover margaritas. Never going back again."}
{"text":"I took my family to eat here.. as soon as we sat down ,  the tables smelled like dirty towels that haven't been washed in weeks.. my son was disgusted and we walked right out.. all the tables smelled this way... this was the second time I came here.. the first time was with my wife.. the service was not good and over priced.. I tried to give them a second chance. They failed.. I will never go there again.. now I know y the place is always empty..9-28-17 up date.. they closed the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Why do I keep getting suckered into spending my hard earned money here?  Its not that its HORRIBLE... its just not worth it.  There are so many mom & pop places that are SO much better that need our business.

They're just not that good.  Always hit or miss.  

I've gotta put my foot down!"}
{"text":"Not going to beat around the bush here, the biggest problem with this place is the food.  We thought it was AWFUL.  Not good, not okay, but AWFUL.  This was our first and last time there.  We took a few bites and left.

My husband's burger tasted off, like ground beef was past its freshness date.  My riblet basket was worse.  The dish had 2 unrecognizable \"riblets\".  They were these 1/4 inch thick, flattened things...at first glance they looked like rehydrated mini sheets of beef jerky.  When you broke them apart, they seemed like real meat with flat bones, but then you taste it and it tastes like those gross artificial, frozen pork products you find in bad cafeterias or cheap buffets.  The kicker was my son's kids meal.  He ordered cheese pizza.  What arrived was a tortilla with cheap-tasting red sauce and  cheese.  A tortilla!!!   Now he's 5 yrs old and was hungry, so he actually ate a few bites, but I cringed as I watched him eat it, and vowed to never come back.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  I can only imagine they make most of their profits from liquor/beer sales.  The only decent things we ordered were my other son's chicken tenders and milkshakes for both kids.  Luckily, those are hard to screw up.

Other things to note:  After ordering, we noticed that every so often an unpleasant odor, like a sewer/dirty-bathroom smell, would waft by, though we were nowhere near the bathroom.  Also, the server, while nice and attentive, seemed to know the food was awful....we sensed it in her body language, that she knew why we were in a hurry to leave and leaving uneaten food on our plates.  The nice server was the only reason this place gets 2 stars rather than 1."}
{"text":"I only go out to eat once a month and I decided Applebees was it. 

I only gave it a star because it require me to rate it but I feel it deserves a half stare. After eating here I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. 

It started with a phone call. They said there was no wait. That should have been my first clue, for a Friday night rush. When we get there 3 mins later there is actually a 15 minuet wait. You cannot tell me that in 3 mins 4-5 tables came in all of a sudden. 

Then came the ordering. The waitress messed up my drinks, also had to ask for water 3 times before I got some. We ordered appetizers when we ordered drinks.  

Appetizers took an hour to get and 1:3 were cold and only a partial portion 3 tacos and not 4. 

At that point my table asked for a manager. The manager said it was a coaching experience for the waitress. Did not apologize and blames the computer for the issue. And rudely said (eye role heard in her voice about the partial appetizer comment) \"let me go get that last taco for you.\" 

When our food was arriving the waitress said the potato would take about her 5 min. The person who got the potato said \"I don't want a potato microwaved\". I agree with her statement. If you go out you should not be getting a potato microwaved.   The steak was hard as a brick and the grilled veggies were solid half slabs not sliced and they were raw in the middle.  The waitress said there would be 4 grilled veggies and the woman only got two labs of squash and 3 red pepper slices. 

So the \"manager\" said \"I'll go back and get you another side\" in the most Obnoxious tone I've ever heard. I have no idea how she can be a manager. I feel like our waitress was more a manager than the actual manager even though she was slow.  As soon as she realized our irritation  she became more attentive. 

In the end we got one meal taken off which is the least they could do. 

I will never be back to this one. I know a better one in central phx I will be glade to drive an extra 30 mins to go to."}
{"text":"So far so good. About to dig in to this scampi and penne. Nice atmosphere and good staff."}
{"text":"Sorry Applebee's, your formula doesn't work anymore.  With so many other options nearby, you'll do better with a meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST restaurant experience my entire family has ever had.
We waited for over 30min just for our appetizer, then 30mins later they brought out 1 plate of food to a table of 4. And the food was BURNT! So burnt they shouldn't have even brought it out. So we send it back to the kitchen. We wait ANOTHER 15min, finally decide to get up and head to the TGI's around the corner from this place. They offered to cover the appetizers and apologized but there was no excuse for such crappy service when the place was more than half empty. Will NEVER Come back! Save your time & money people, go some where else!"}
{"text":"Okay folks I was not feeling up to going here but the lil lady felt the need to enjoy happy hour.  I passed on drinks but they sure looked great and she was just a smiling. The food came out fast and service was as if we were the only folks in town.  Great food 1/2 price during the happy hour and I must say I was felling Applebee's again.  I had lost interest in them after my last encounter at another location.  and I can't leave out the doorman/greeter he was on his JOB!  I will make this location a place I come to again.  

Thanks, :)"}
{"text":"Sitting at the Mellow Mushroom right across the street, just keep asking myself why didn't we do this the first time? We wanted to get something to eat like a small app and a cold beer, and we really happened to have a gift card for this place. We entered, smelt like burnt oil, bar counter top was gross and not clean at all... onion rings were okay, but the mozzarella sticks sucked. You've done it again, Crapelbees. J
This is the second time I've been to this place in another state, and yet it disappoints. Service was okay."}
{"text":"So here we,are at Applebee's un the bar.  Our server/waitress was Amy.  Unfortunately she left much to be desired as a server.  She took our drink order at the same time I figured we ordered appetizers.  We asked for a half order of the chicken wonton tacos and a full order of the salsa verde nachos. what we got was 1/2 orders of each, which worked out better cause there's a better price.  Anyway, there weren't that many people in the bar and we had to wave her down to get a 2nd round of beers, then we had to wave her down to get small plates for our appetizers.  All in all, I don't think we'll be going back to this Applebee's.  There are other places that have better atmosphere, servers, prices, and quality."}
{"text":"Went there after CLT Vintage. Really great bartender. Didn't have what I would like to drink but offered substitutions...always nice. Bartender is Corey. Really nice!  Would absolutely go there again!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this crappy place. Food and service sucks. Will not return to this garbage trash. The waitress don't want to work for their tips. They looked pissed because it's Saturday and they Stuck working."}
{"text":"Went there a couple days ago with my mom for a late lunch. I ordered a shrimp and spinach salad and it was super awesome. I think it had a Bacon dressing, I don't know but it was amazing!  The staff was crazy friendly and accommodating. I ordered diet and gave me regular and switched it without any hesitation. I plan to go there again and order the shrimp salad again.....again. good customer service. Gottta love that."}
{"text":"Our server was AWESOME! I think his name was ken. He was a tall African American man. The kitchen was kinda slow though, but it was understood. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"Wow what a terrible meal at Applebee's. Most Applebee's locations have always been consistently good. I and my friend both ordered their new southwestern salad. Big mistake. The presentation of the salad on the plate was the worst I have ever seen.  simple iceberg lettuce with some slight additions and the lettuce was wet and no dressing.  I would've told them to take that back to the kitchen but didn't want to embarrass my friend who's plate looked just like mine.  The chef must have been hallucinating by putting that out.  Really bad !"}
{"text":"I am very upset with the service here that my family and I had tonight. The server brought the water very late after we ordered them (BEING THE ONLY TABLE). We ordered hot wings, for a table of 5. We got them with no sharing plates, and not even one napkin or silverware. While my hand in the air, making eye contact with my server, he ignored out table over and over. Finally having one of us chase him down and ask for the things, the simple things that should have been brought. He brought 3 plate for 5 people and 6 napkins. Along with the beginning being horrible service, The salads we subbed for French fries was double charged according the the receipt on the tablet. The manager had to walk by to realize we had no silverware. The manager was very helpful. I am not pleased with this service. I will not sit with him again."}
{"text":"Last visit was Saturday December 17 for dinner. Had a gift card so the family and I did dinner and a movie.  Upon entering the restaurant we were blinded by a lamp aimed directly at the door from the hostess station. Apparently the overhead lights in the lobby were out. As we were lead to our table, I noticed food and debris on the floor. We were seated next to the utensil folding station even though there were plenty of other tables available to accommodate the four of us. I had to wait for the hostess to move the broom and dust pan out of the way so I could take a seat. She dropped all four of our rolled up silver wear on the floor while trying to move the broom. She then put those on our table rather than reach over to the utensil folding table and get fresh ones. Our order took 45 minutes to finally reach our table. My vegetables were overlooked as was my steak. My daughter's steak was overlooked as well. My husband's burger was overlooked and dry. We ordered four desert shooters. My daughter's desert glass was broken almost in half. How could they NOT notice that. We will not be back there again."}
{"text":"Applebee's. That's about what I can say for the food. You get decent chain restaurant food here. The main reason I am reviewing them is they have a late night happy hour in the bar area from 10pm to close. There actually aren't a ton of choices to get some food after 9 or 10pm in Las Vegas. So if you are hungry late night, drop in, the bar staff is usually great!!"}
{"text":"Originally I called for a pickup which they got my order wrong, even after repeated back to me two times. Then this food was so disgusting,  I could of cooked it better than that yuck! Not even worth the $10 special it isn't even worth $3 it's disgusting."}
{"text":"I went to get an order to go and sat at the bar. After I ordered, the waitress/bartender gave me my receipt and I placed my credit card on top of it. I eventually noticed that this waitress was taking care of everyone else around me but me. My card was on top of the receipt for more than 10 minutes, when finally I couldn't take it anymore. I said \"Excuse me, I've been ready to pay [point to my card]\" and she responded \"Oh I'll be there in 2 seconds.\" Then she finally took care of my payment and tried to justify my wait by saying \"It should be ready in just a few minutes.\" 
Lesson learned:
Don't go to this crap-service restaurant."}
{"text":"After our sucky experience at Mellow Mushroom the staff here made it amazing!  Got our drinks immediately and ordered our food. Since they are closing they blasted awesome music. Ending this night perfectly! Thanks Applebee's"}
{"text":"The desserts are just awesome.  They have a deal  2 for $20 which is a great offer and various items to choose from. The ladies serving are very polite.  Ambience is very nice"}
{"text":"Rude waiter wouldn't seat us at an empty restaurant said it was a 15 minute wait for a table when there were 20 empty . Customer service here is terrible"}
{"text":"Okay. Boyfriend wanted to try the 2 for 25.00. Ordered the artichoke dip appetizer. Cold slimy and came with the bits and tiny pieces of tortilla chips from the bottom of the bag. Returned it for fresh dip. Came back same way. Ugh. Just pushed it aside. Next ribs. Omg.... sauce was Asian style beyond spicy and could not get spice out of my mouth. Returned that to for ribs without sauce. Green beans had no garlic sauce that was supposed to come on them. Boyfriend ordered macaroni and cheese 4 cheeses. It was dried out and greasy. Little bits of chicken tenders like from a kids plate. Don't you take pride in what you put out in product. The server Tiffany was very nice. I should have complained. 35.00 for crappy food and it was frustrating. Let's see if management cares. Be proud of your food."}
{"text":"Worst I have seen. Ordered two meals for 11.99 each. Had  water to drink each. Photo in menu showed slaw dis and fries. Plate came out with 3 fried fish and a hand full of fries. Bill came to 36.00. Then I was told they made a mistake but could not refund my card. Manager finally came back and wanted my card again. Said he was paying for the third meal they accidentally charged to my card. I don't care if he has to pay for Applebee's mistake. What bothers me is that he was ok with me paying for something I never ordered or received. I do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Usually Applebee's is one of our favorite places. We're new to the area and decided to have a date night for once. It was horrible. We had to buzz for the waitress to take our order.  There was only four other tables in the restraunt so it was not busy at all.  The waitress was nice but got our order wrong, then offered to fix it and still brought out the wrong thing. The steak was really dry and mine was not well done like i asked. I had to ask for water twice and then finally got it, but never got the a1 i asked for. Overall it was the worst date night and we don't get many of those. $40 i would have rather spent somewhere else. Im mad at myself for not getting the receipt because I'm doubting that was correct either. It's really a shame because we love Applebee's. We'll definitely not go back to this particular one anytime soon."}
{"text":"It would help if the front girl don't just sit us down and not ask us for drinks or put us with a waitress. Instead, let us just sit here for almost an hour unattended! If it's time for you to clock out then it's not our problem. But if you're gonna seat us be more professional about it at least then leave!"}
{"text":"I guess there is a difference in menus from state to state.   I love Applebee's in New York, food is great and great choices.  Not so much down here.  We tried the one off of Tryon in Charlotte and the menu didn't have the same food as NY, at least nothing appealed to me as it use to.  Anywho,  I ordered a french onion soup that I barely ate and some fried shrimp dish, the shrimp was just ok.  My daughter ordered mashed potatoes with chicken fingers,  chicken was ok as well but they brought her french fries instead of mashed but because of the service we didn't bother to correct it.   Waitress wasn't too bad, refilled the kids sodas three times even though we didn't want them drinking more than one.  I guess if we want Applebee's again it will have to be in NY."}
{"text":"I love Applebees and everything, but I will NEVER go to this location again. Last time I've been here I got five hundred dollars stolen from me and when I asked for permission to view the tapes the store manager rudely told me no. 

The service wasn't the best either. Hell, I think Mcdonalds has better customer service than this location."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, got a lot of attention. The drink was good and service was fast. Can't find anything else other than I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible service empty drinks, appetizers and food took forever no one came to ask how we were doing,  it was a slow Sat at 4pm and waiter didn't acknowledge us at all had to ask another server to refill are drinks I probably will not return to this location"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They were out ribs and wings, and it could have been from the Mayweather fight but no excuse for the service. First the margarita I ordered was extremely salty at the bottom. We ordered 3 appetizers but they didn't bring us any serving plates when I ask for them as they brought the appetizers they said they would. Waited at least 4 minutes no plates. Got up and walked to near the kitchen to get plates the person that I asked from the beginning to bring them then said my wait or will bring them. Food was not that good the menus were dirty and sticky. Took for ever to get a refill on our drinks"}
{"text":"I would be later coming home from a play Saturday afternoon and I decided to give Applebee's a call and do a Carside to Go.  I called and ordered a 2 for $20.  I ordered the mozzarella sticks for the appetizer and I got the Fiesta Lime chicken for my wife and I got the three cheese chicken penne for myself.  They told me it would be twenty minutes.  

As it turned out, traffic moved well along Charleston heading west and I was at Applebee's in about 10 minutes.  Rather than wait in the car, I went in to let them know I was there and to pay.

The young man working the carside said it would be ready soon and then went to pull the order in the computer.  He couldn't find it and needed to get his manager.  As this was happening, Josh got the order ready but the manager still couldn't retrieve it.  Rather than have me wait, she told me she'd find it later and I should just take the meals home and she wished me a Merry Christmas.  I was taken back by her kindness.

I brought the food home and we both enjoyed our dinners very much.  The chicken is a dish my wife has gotten almost every time we've gone to an Applebee's and it was a treat to have it again.  The penne was very good.  It had some red pepper that gave it a nice kick.  

The next day, I was still upset by getting free meals so I went back to pay.  The same manager came to talk to me and assure me it was OK the way things were.  I made up for it by giving Josh a good tip to share with the servers and kitchen staff.  Merry Christmas to them."}
{"text":"Bundled up against a cold night (yup, we have 'em here in Vegas too!), my family and I headed out for a night out in between holidays this past week. After driving past this Applebee's numerous times in the Boca Park shopping center, we decided to give it a try. 

A hostess (Sandy? - she may have been a server as well) held the door open as we walked in and welcomed us. She promptly brought us to a great booth and informed us that Scott would be our waiter, provided us menus and  asked us to please enjoy our evening.

The restaurant, tables and floors were all clean and holiday music was playing just loud enough that if you wanted to listen, you could, but wasn't so overpowering you weren't able to have a conversation. 

Scott came over and greeted us. He was friendly and engaging, and we were very pleased with him and our conversation throughout the evening. I highly recommend visiting and requesting this knowledgeable and engaging server.

The food came out in sequential order, fresh, hot and delicious. Our son's meal - which we ordered with the appetizer - actually beat the appetizer out. As any parent will tell you, that was a welcome surprise as know that our little one was occupied with his favorite things, the parent were able to have adult conversations and enjoy our drinks and appetizer.  

As parents of a toddler, we were in no rush to return home on one of our few nights out. We leisurely ate our appetizer and though he had  our dinner orders, Scott held entering them into the kitchen until we were ready. 

I ordered a steak-shrimp combo from the 550-calorie menu and my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. We ordered both items medium and the meats were cooked perfectly. Our son's burger was also done properly and served in a basket that was not hot to the touch (unlike some restaurants that forget that they're delivering plates to tiny tender hands).

Scott kept the table clean and neat throughout our dining experience and was always right on hand when we needed something like a refill or extra napkins. Not once did we have to look around to find him or deal with an empty glass or dirty plate. He was attentive and thoughtful in all his actions. As veterans of the restaurant biz, my husband and I were impressed and appreciative.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Applebee's and plan on making this a monthly outing for the family (at minimum). We can't wait to return and look forward to another quality dining experience with a great team of FOH and BOH there.

Thanks, Applebee's, for making family night out delicious and delightful.  Every member of our family came home happy and full.  Special thanks to Scott as well. Can't wait to see you next time!

~The Swisher Family."}
{"text":"Mom and I were just passing through and stopped for lunch. The service was terrible. The manager tried to make foolish jokes and conversation with us but caught neither of us finding him amusing. He sat us in the bar area and than disappeared for the rest of the time we were there, even when we were asking for a manager he did not come around. The bartender who never gave her name but spent a lot of time at staring at the bar dreaming- clearly seemed to have better things on her mind. We sat for about 5 minutes before drinks were offered and another 10 before our appetizers were taken. We probably waited 35+ minutes for our salad and dip to come out. 

She messed up the girls behind us order at least twice and talked them like she knew more about how they wanted their food cooked than she did. They sent there steak back twice to be recooked. 

We kept trying to get our bill to pay and leave an couldn't get her attention. And again no manager available to help. When we were leaving we asked if she was newer to this place where the hostess made sure to point out that the bartender was one of the better and long term server/bartenders. She needs a lot of training...especially with customer service! 

We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Sad sorry service. If you want to drop a few pounds this is the place to eat lunch as the soup and salad lunch deal is one time only and that is so small that my girlfriend and I laughed out loud. Never even offered a tea refill after waiting 30 min for our tiny lunch. No wonder I dislike this joint."}
{"text":"Took my family from out of town here...never again!  The food was terrible.  I felt sorry for our server because she was great, but the food was nasty.  It's not the cleanest place and the wait time is ridiculous.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The manager kicked me and my friends out because everybody had their ID except one of us but she is 21. We both had drinks she did not. She tasted my drink and said it was to strong. She did not ask for any drinks. He saw her sip mine then rudely said \"do you have your ID? We already carded you all and u didn't have your ID so I'm going to have to ask y'all to leave\" we said can we just eat our food then no drinks. He said no you gotta leave."}
{"text":"1.wait time was 30 minutes,then we get to table , 25  more minutes till food , then the order I had was not good , had to reorder , said it would take 10 minutes but it was longer , when they bought my food I asked for a to go box, people I was with had eaten their meal... next time I will come earlier and order different food"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nastiest Applebee's I have ever been to. The place was very dirty and there was more than enough staff to keep it clean. It looks like they just don't care. Food tasted reheated and old. Our overall experience was very poor. Our server was Justin and he was very polite."}
{"text":"Location is closed. Looks like a leasing issue. Note on door says property has been takin over by landlord."}
{"text":"Use to go here at least twice a month. Service and food has become so poor that we have decided we are not going back."}
{"text":"I have visited this location on multiple occasions and every time the experience has been horrible. Last night was the final straw, this place is definitely in need of new management and a visit from corporate. Yesterday the place was an igloo absolutely freezing. The crew members were supervising the store with no manager in sight. The food took 50 minutes to be served to us, and came out ice cold. Overall, avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"We always go in after 9pm so we usually get happy hr! I was on a mission to get hammered because it was a long day with my old man and he was hella being a nag... Our waiter comes up and asks if we want a \"perfect margarita\" and said it was basically just teq and the sour mix so I was like \"oh hells yea\" after the first drink I was like feelin it. That or I had gas, anyway it was yummy!

We also always get the 2 for 20 deal, so I get a 9oz steak medium well with double mashed and loaded like a mofo... the steak was so-so, I usually get medium but felt adventurous.... I shall step back from the ledge now because the m/w was nothing special. I can only handle 1 order of the loaded mashed, so I took the other home. We also had boneless wings and artichoke dip for an appetizer... I was trying not to eat because I wanted to get drunk, as I stated earlier. Not a good idea to try and do so when youre starving. The food was ok, I could've cooked something tastier but our little old waiter man was super cute. I was trying to hit on him, but my bf cack blocked me.

My bf is one of those weirdos who can eat whatever and not gain weight so of course his fat ace was still hungry and wanted desert. I sat there like a beluga whale giving him dirty looks because I wanted to leave, I hadnt wore my stretchy pants, so the button was ripping into my skin. He ordered some giant cookie with diabetes atop. I looked at it and almost vomited... no bueno! It tasted nasty, I told him to get the blondie next time because thats def the business!

By this time I'm trying to suck down whatevers left of my pom perfect margarita so we can bounce and perhaps have fun... but that bastard didnt kick in because I stuffed my belly stupid. Anyway, the food was ok, the drinks we yummy, and my lover aka old man waiter was awesome! We go there like once a week, so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"I worked at several Applebee's throughout college so I got a little burnt out on them. However, my parents love to eat there. I like to believe it reminds them of me. Yet I know the real reason is the Weight Watchers menu. I ordered the garlic steak, medium. It came with side of baked new potatoes and large mushroom cap stuffed with spinach and little bit of Parmesan cheese. Everything was bland except for the steak. The steak was tender and flavorful. Not bad for $12.49. It's barely above fast food, but I'll probably return for their Weight Watchers menu."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight - hardly anyone there so we thought it'd be fast service. We were seated promptly, but then waited 5 min for the waitress to make her way to our table to see what drinks we wanted. Then 10 min go by.... We ended up walking out before she even asked us if we were ready to order."}
{"text":"I went to this Applebee's recently with part of a medium sized group.  Even though I go up to Norterra/Happy Valley area on a quite regular basis, I had NO idea where this was when someone suggested it.  Luckily, we found it tucked right next to the Bank of America.  

We arrived around 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  There might have been a bomb scare at some point, because the place was maybe 25-30% full.  We were seated quickly and had very good service the whole time, our waitress being very patient with us while we chatted for awhile before even checking out the menus.  The food was ok, I ordered the trios (or whatever their menu is where you order three items).  It was fine, nothing special though.  

The food was closer to a 2.5 and the service was a 4, so I'm averaging and rounding down to a 3.  I don't have any reason to not go here, but I don't really have any reason to, and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ask to see Michael's smiley face tattoo  He may be quiet but you can get him talking! Best time I've had at a bar in Applebee's. He even talked about football, basketball, and taught me a thing or two! Thanks Michael!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something good to replace fast food, try the curbside pick up at Applebee's.  Service is awesome and you don't even have to get out of the car.  I ordered the Smoky lemon grilled chicken with the cranberry rice and the apple relish.  It is on the Pub diet menu so fast and delish."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago and instead of skipping over their Weight Watchers menu I actually tried something on it. They had two salads on there that sounded interesting one had fruit in it and the other one had steak and potatoes. I tried the one with steak and potatoes of course! It was different but it felt like a whole meal and it was good! The salad also had fresh spinach and finished off by a tasty vinaigrette that I wouldn't mind having again!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is Applebee's right? I don't think that it happens often enough that the people doing well in their service roles get the credit they deserve. We love going to this location because of two employees in particular. Lessa and Spencer ALWAYS go above and beyond what would be expected of a server. They seem to have an innate sense of exactly how often to check in on a table. It never seems forced or over the top. They are always genuine and proactive about making sure everything is perfect. Doesn't matter what time it is or how many tables they are handling. As long as these two are here, we'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"Very clean and good location. Been here several times, usually for happy hour, and have never had a bad experience. Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go.  They recently got Kilt lifter in which is a bonus!

Honestly its a solid place for those trying this budget thing out.  There are many specials and the food is always decent enough.  Service is friendly, but at times can be sketchy.  But since they are rotating servers all the time, I can't hold that too much against them.

Its a solid 3 star place.  But remember, its applebees, so you should know what to expect."}
{"text":"Kudos to Applebee's for opening early for breakfast to raise money for the families of the two Metro Police Officers and a citizen recently killed in Las Vegas. Breakfast was very good, the service was excellent and thank you for being a Community Partner. All funds raised will be donated."}
{"text":"Horrible service, and the food is never done right when we go there. The waitress we had the last time made us wait 45 mins for DRINKS. If that wasn't bad enough, she got ALL of our orders wrong in some way, gave major attitude when we told her they were wrong, and then she just...never came back to our table. I will say that the management did apologize, gave us a free dessert, comped our entire meal, AND gave us some free drink coupons, which is the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Plus this place stinks like burnt fries and fish."}
{"text":"Today confirmed why I never come to AppleBee's. Waitress didn't know anything about the menu. Order was mixed up and the food was just ok. I rather pay double across the street at Honey Salt."}
{"text":"I ordered online and got a confirmation email to have my order brought ou to me. No one came out to my car at the curbside pick up. I went in and 2 different people checked With me and finally after 15 minutes someone else checked with me and got me my order and told me I needed to pay at the bar but I had already paid online. Don't think I'll be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"This place is awful! I waited and waited for water and lemon.... If the wait for water was an indication of the wait I would be having for any food I'm not waiting! Sorry this location just lost our business for life!! Sorry not sorry! Not sure the servers name however you suck dude it was only water! There are much better places to give my money to around here!!!"}
{"text":"At least theyre customer service is better than the other location the new food items not the best! pretzels were good but everything else just so-so at best"}
{"text":"Came in today in search of something new and tried their Southwestern Steak Salad. This is The Best Southwestern Steak Salad I ever had. Fresh ingredients and steak cooked to perfection. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Try the Roma Pepper Steak medium rare.  It comes with a portobello mushroom covered with grated Parmesan cheese and a side of steamed potatoes.  A good weight watchers meal.  Only 13 points.  The meal was very tasty and satisfying.  Service was good.  Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Applebee's in a while but we came to try the $1 margaritas. I mean who doesn't want that?! It was the typical experience, nothing spectacular about it. there was a diverse group of patrons but one loud group at the bar. Seems as though they were regulars, because the bar tender was very friendly with them. We did the 2/20. Had the spinach dip and the bourbon chicken, food was edible.  Other than that, I would say, if you had to choose don't chose this one."}
{"text":"We tried this location again today...  wow.  It was chaos from the moment we walked in until we threw money on the table and walked out.  DAYUM people, WTF already??!??  SO IRRITATING!"}
{"text":"This Applebee's was very nice, friendly wait staff, not too crowded, and was open until midnight on a Sunday night, just for me of course.

It seems that they have done some surgery on their menu, and I like the result.  My favorite meal, blackened chicken pasta, has several options that give you some more choice."}
{"text":"Went here the other night because I was craving the Butter Pecan Blonde and they had 2 for $20. They sat us in the last booth and to the left of our table was like the \"kick it spot\" for employees. Employees were eating, I guess on break, reading, on their phones, one lady was taking an assessment on the computer (which was VERY LOUD might I add). It was very unprofessional and I really couldn't even enjoy my meal. Don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We went to this location on a slow Saturday night around 9:30. The service was slow and we were constantly flagging down anyone In a uniform to get plates, napkins, etc. I was horrified when we sat for 15 minutes with empty glasses and finally the hostess passed by our table. I asked patiently for a couple refills and she rolled her eyes and said rudely, \"I don't even know what you're drinking.\" I was pretty shocked and was done at that point. We quickly finished our meal and had to go walk around the restaurant to find the bartender/server to get out of there. 

This was our 5th time to the restaurant and had consistently below average service but this was awful. I understand a hostess's job is not to refill drinks but anyone in a uniform should know they are there for the customer. We spoke to the manager and he said they would take care of us \"next time.\" Thank you, but there will be no \"next time\" for us or anyone we know."}
{"text":"So this was a tough review to write.

About 10 years ago, I got a very bad case of food poisoning from an Applebee's. I was violently ill for about 48 hrs.  Needless to say, every time I heard the name, I would think of the Asian chicken salad I had ordered, and how something didn't seem right with it.  Then, I think of the pain I was in, and the violent vomiting and bowel movements I had for 2 days.

Again, it goes without saying, that I avoided Applebees for a very long time.

My ex finally convinced me to try it again, as their menu had changed a lot, and had some new items on it. So I gave it a try.

WOW.  I ordered the all day brunch burger.  Did I say wow?  That burger was the most flavorful, juiciest burer I have had in a long long time.  The hashbrowns on it, with the fried egg....YUM!  It comes with ketchup...but no one in their right mind puts ketchup on a burger.  Gross. I had them put their special signature grill sauce on it.   Perfect.
Even the French fries were really long, hot and crisy.

Ill be back for that burger."}
{"text":"Applebees is applebees. Lol. Its not a five star place but its cool to go there and have drinks and watch football or basketball. They have that 2 people for $20 deal, so that's always good. My waiter was nice and gave me extra patron for this sweet margarita the bartender made. Food didn't take long and it was pretty good. I was mad they were out of ribblets tho. Lol"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everything has been pretty mediocre. Decided to try again last night and service was horrendous. Server took over 15 minutes to take our drink order and told us 3 times he'd be right with us then never stopped. Our dessert was brought to the wrong table and it took over 10 minutes for our server to notice. The food was average at best and the triple chocolate meltdown tasted like a frozen and then microwaved cake with a lot of artificial chocolate syrup. Will not be coming back to this location unfortunately."}
{"text":"LUNCH REVIEW ONLY:
Busy, busy, busy. Short staffed.

I used to go at lunch for the 5.99 soup and salad deal. Started out great, but now you get a cup of soup and a tiny bowl of salad for each serving, and they tend not to stop by often to check on you. Realistically, you get 1 refill, as they are very slow getting seconds from the kitchen.

Recently, lunchtimes have been absolutely packed. I tried to go last week, but there was a 15 minute wait for a table, and I only saw 3 or 4 servers in the entire restaurant. No thanks! We went elsewhere.

Admittedly I have had good service there at lunch, but not recently,  and the few occasions I have gone for dinner have been OK too."}
{"text":"It was my first visit.
I order appetiser and pasta for Entries.
Server was ok.
Food was ok.
Overall experience ok."}
{"text":"Well first time in years my daughter asks us where we want to go for dinner and we brag about this place! It was awful! She wasted about $100 on a dinner that all five of us thought was awful. Come to find out when the newest manager, Debra Hall(wheatherly) calls me couple days later, they have changed their meat supplier! After several minutes and finding out I was the third person to call them on this just this week, I am told we would get a gift card from them for wasting our time and money on that horrible dinner!  That was 1/10/17, here we are 2/13/17 and still nothing! I guess they figure those of us who complained are small enough, no need to worry. Well I work for a big doctors office here and so does my daughter. My son in law works on the strip. WORD of Mouth folks. Not a good place to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in. Nobody warned us the air was broken when we came in. Found a bug in my beer. My pasta was bland as can be. Worst Applebee's experience."}
{"text":"Came in real late , almost closing time. We were welcomed by Sam our waitress. She had a huge smile and an amazingly friendly personality. She never mentioned the time or made us feel rushed. Sam was spot on the food and drinks. Fast! 
   We also noticed the other employees where smiling and having pleasant exchanges. 
   This team works impressively well together! 
   
  Thank you Applebees team.

   YOU MY BOY BLUE!"}
{"text":"BEST BONELESS WINGS, hands down! I will be back, over and over and over JUST FOR THOSE BONELESS WINGS! They are perfectly sized, & actually have plenty of meat unlike Buffalo Wild Wings. Service was good, no complains."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing time ever at this Applebee's today!! Great company, great food, and the most amazing server ever! Make sure you ask for Austin!"}
{"text":"Not the worst, but definitely could have been better.  I don't like having an empty glass while I'm at a restaurant, you would figure on a slow Monday night service would be a bit better.  We walked in and no greeter was there, no line of people either.  When asking for sauce it shouldn't arrive after your food has gotten cold.  Dirty silverware is always a turn off.  Not that we were planning on getting dessert it wasn't even offered before our waiter brought the check.  Actually it was never offered.  Most likely our last visit here, now I remember why we quit coming here, usually get bad service at Applebees."}
{"text":"Worst chain of restaurants in AZ. Go buy a Budget Gourmet tv dinner...heat it up and that's how Applebee's tastes. Rumor has it that they actually do use a microwave for most of their dishes. Pasta Alfredo is one of them. Just plain gross. The only reason I would go here is for their cheap happy hour for the drinks."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place!! My husband and I went here just last Saturday night. We were looking forward to it since we have two little ones and time alone is precious. We got there and I can say that I understand it's Saturday night and about 11 so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt as to the cleanliness of the floors and stuff. We thought it was cool that they have \"tablets\" on the table now so we ordered our apps with the tablet and then the server came over. \"What y'all drinking?\" Ummmm hello. How are you? Ok so two strikes by this point. Next thing I know the server, our server, is cleaning a table next to ours and she takes a broom that has probably been in the store for at least 5 years and sweeps the table top off. There was only like two straw wrappers and maybe a lemon wedge on the table. She just took that old nasty broom and swept the table top!!  CHECK PLEASE. I have worked in this business since I was 14 and even then I would have never did this. Ridiculous. Called the manager and cancelled our order. If she can do this in front of us and about 5-6 other tables there is no telling what she is doing in the back when we can't see her. NEVER going here again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I've always liked Applebee's and this location is pretty much the same as the rest. What impressed me most about this particular one was that after a LARGE group of teenage girls (I'm talkin' 15-20 girls) was seated right next to us, the manager came over to our table and offered to seat us elsewhere if we preferred. We graciously declined since we were halfway through our meal, but it was a kind gesture!

Also, this was the first time trying their Crispy Orange Chicken and I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"This location has got to be the worst I have ever been to, ever.
My husband, brother and I came in on a Wednesday night at about 10:45.
There were only a few other guests there, mostly sitting at the bar.
We were sat quickly and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back quickly to take our meal orders.
My husband got the Standard Burger, the waitress asked him \"Pink or No Pink\" to which my husband responded \"No Pink\" and even followed up with \"Well Done\".
Personally, I would think that meant he wanted the burger cooked all the way through.
We got our food out and my husband cuts his burger in half... Low and behold the burger is pink throughout. 
We call the waitress over to the table, show her the burger and remind her that he asked for well done. She responds with, \"it's only a little pink, but I can put it back on the grill.\"
My husband verifies that she plans on putting a but in half burger back on the grill, with all of the sauce and cheese already on it... 
She then says, \"oh, you want a new one... Okay.\" 
Meanwhile, my brother and I have our food and are done eating.
The manager brings his new burger out to us and explains that we will not be charged for the burger, we ask for it to go and the manager has an attitude about it and walks away while my husband is APOLOGIZING to him for the extra task! (If the food was cooked the correct way in the first place this would have been a non-issue)
We then get the food to go and tip the waitress (for what I am not sure) and are walking out, all the while the manager is glaring at us from the bar.
Never, EVER will I come to this location again."}
{"text":"If I ever go to Applebees again, I will only order drinks. Every time I go there I get really sick afterwards!! Even a salad there turns my stomach sour!! Its so weird, and I am not the only one either, my boyfriend will get really sick after as well. Drinks also take a while to get every time we go.

Now the servers at Applebees are very friendly, it sucks that they have to sell such a bad product!!

I hate seafood, and I would much rather go to red lobster next door to this place."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal."}
{"text":"The appetizers are honestly the only thing worth going for...and maybe the car side service (and easy online ordering). But if you dine-in unfortunately be prepared to be disappointed. I loved Applebee's growing up and it's a shame this is the location closest to where I live now. The quality of the food is always below par. Steak? Forget about it. I heard an older gentleman at the next table tell the server it was the worst he's ever had in his life and I don't doubt that! The chicken is often not cooked well either. Like I said appetizers and maybe drinks...go ahead. Otherwise not worth it."}
{"text":"*** THIS BUSINESS IS CLOSED **
Decided to stop by for a burger, Cowboy burger in fact.  The wait service was good, no complaints; the restaurant itself was OK, no complaints; the burger was salty, over cooked and dried out...simply terrible!!  I may go back occasionally to Applebee's but not for the Cowboy burger."}
{"text":"I've been twice now in the last couple month, and both times found the service to be good.  I know what to expect in an Applebee's and that's what I go for.  I sat at the tables around the bar one time and in a far back booth the second time.

I much enjoyed the appetizers, the meals, and desserts.  

As a comment to other low star reviews.  My experience is probably different because I go during non peak times.  Middle of the afternoon before dinner crowd or later in the evening after the rush."}
{"text":"Arrowheads Applebee's is much more enjoyable! Went to karaoke last night an it was so horrible. The dj and his crew sang most of the songs :/ there were some families after 11... I thought there had to be an age limit to be in the bar after 10? There were some annoying high school girls screaming spice girls... Help me!!!!"}
{"text":"Was traveling on business from Phoenix on Oct 13th (just doing expense report today ;-). Flight was late, late hotel, etc. Was the only place open but Sarah G. was our server. She was so nice. Got the order in right away, had a great personality and kept the drinks full. Best service I've ever had at an Applebees!"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 mins to be seated on a day where there was no line and barely any customers. Worst part is that the lady walked past my group of 3 multiple times and never apologized for the wait. Love their food but worst customer service"}
{"text":"I really don't know where to begin.. I wish I would of looked on Yelp before we stopped in. My grandparents are in town and this is one of their favorites back home so we decided to stop in tonight. We were seated fast and the waiter came taking our drink orders right away.. He came back about 2 minutes later with our drinks..we were not ready to order a yet (group of 6) so he said he would come back soon and check with us again..it took him 15 minutes to come back and take our order..lucky my kids were playing with the tablet they had on the table and lost track of time.. He came and took our order and to my surprise he didn't write down one thing anyone said .. He just kept saying \"yes sir\" \"ok\" so at that moment I was a little worried if he was going to get everyone's order in correctly. We waited another 30 minutes for an order of Spanish dip and mozzarella sticks..which he never brought us any plates for. 25 minutes later half of us received our main dish. My grandfather ordered baked potato and was given fries.. He let him keep them and went and got him a potato. He said the kids meals and my husbands chicken and shrimp were coming.. We ask for another round of drinks.. He said he would be right back.. Another women came out with my husbands meal but didn't know about the kids orders.. We waited another 20 minutes for my kids food and our drinks to come. Everybody else was almost done with their food..They had chicken tenders and fries and a cheese pizza and fries. Of course it took another 15 minutes to flag him down for our check.. 75$ check I only left a 8$ tip.. Trust me I didn't want to leave that. But I will say the food we received was good.. We all did enjoy our food...just wish we could of enjoyed it together. This experience was a real big disappointment for my family.. We just wanted a nice evening with our grandparents and it turned in to a frustrating long night. We love Applebee's and this location is close to our house but sadly we will never return to this location after tonight's experience."}
{"text":"I'll give this one star because I have to but honestly they deserve not even half a star. My boyfriend and I just sat in this restaurant for almost 25minutes and didn't even have waters yet or have an order taken. Took10 minutes for someone to even greet us and I was amazed considering how many employees were standing around (including managers) and not one was providing any help or appearing to be a team atmosphere. Especially considering there was maybe 3 tables in there and over 7 staff members standing around talking. Coming from someone in this industry I can say that I am beyond disappointed with how poor this place is ran. 90% of a restaurants reputation is the service provided and in 25minutes I can say the lack of service speaks for itself. Step it up and look into new staff."}
{"text":"Went to Applebee's at Happy Valley/I-17 on Friday night to use our \"25th Anniversary\"  gift card with hubby and son.  We all ordered the Blue Cheese Bacon Hamburger.  It was loaded!   The blue cheese was probably the best weve ever had!  
The only dissappointment we had was the low portion of french fries I received in my order and had to ask for some more.  When more arrived it was about 15 more in a rather large basket??   What's up with the french fries Applebee's??  IS there a shortage of potatoes? 
Other then that it was a good dinner and we were so fullllll."}
{"text":"So I came here for dinner tonight and I just wanna say the service here is beyond ridiculous.  We got here at 9pm and the place was dead. Ordered our drinks right away and didn't get them until 930pm ONLY because I had to wave down our waitress (who spent most of the night talking to the bartender). She apologized and said she forgot. Yeah because she was so busy in a deserted restaurant.  Are you kidding me? Our food came out and looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. The manager looked like a moron just walking around with his thumb in his ass. All in all the place needs to get it together and get formal training in customer service. So disappointed. I'll never return to this location EVER. Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience here, but we didn't really eat.  We sat at the bar, had a few drinks, and a dessert.  Service was very quick, and friendly.  The bartender even played wii with us on one of their monitors.
I don't think I would come here to eat.  I've had Applebee's a lot, and their food is always pretty mediocre.  The bar, however, isn't bad. 
Happy hour is 3-6pm and 9pm-close on weekdays, and all day on Sundays.  Don't quote me on this, but I believe the deal is  $3 domestic drafts, Long Island Iced Teas, House Margaritas, and $4 import drafts."}
{"text":"We are always greeted by Julia with such genuine care and smile, when she is working. The food is prepared the way you like.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in to this location to give it another try from my bad experience a year ago. Apparently the haven't changed much.  Waited 30 minutes for 2 lunch entrees.  Mediocre food. Not impressed. A manager had to stop by 3 tables around us with for problems. But will not be returning."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Applebee's in years. Returning reminded me why.

The food tastes as though it's frozen from the bag. Like all of it. I came with a party of 6 and all of us were disappointed. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and should've saved $3 and got one from Taco Bell. My friend got buffalo wings- they didn't even cover the wings fully in sauce. 

I swear the server was high. And he was awkward. I had some concerns because he looked like he was about to pass out at any minute. 

Wait time for the food ridiculous and multiple tables were complaining. At 6PM on a Sunday, no one want to wait 30 minutes for an Applebee's meal."}
{"text":"Came in here on a stormy summer day and was greeted by the most friendliest bar staff.  The bartender Tracie was nothing but smiles and full of joy.  She made the whole experience comforting and relaxing.   I have returned many times because of Tracie, I would recomment anyone wanting a good time during happy hour to check out this place and ask for Tracie at the bar, she will take care of you."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I go to Applebee's. We wanted to go out for a decent dinner and figured a chain like Applebee's would be good. As we first walked into this place the smell was not so good. I could not recall the smell but it was not that of a restaurant. 

We get our seat and look at the menu.  The waitress takes our order, and then goes on to explain we chose great meals. She wishes she could afford what we ordered. She also gave us a sense that she did not like her job. So I assume the pay at Applebee's is subpar, or her productivity is of the same level. As she walked away she looked to the hostess and said I need to smoke lets go. I'm sure the management does not have a clue of how bad you truly are. 

I ordered a medium steak, to my surprise I get a rare steak. My wife orders a medium well steak and gets a medium. This lets me know the chef has no idea what he is doing in the back and the training program is below par. I would have sent it back but this place looked to like one of them that you would get more than you asked for. 

As we go to pay, which now is a machine because the waitresses are so busy talking crap about everyone to take my payment. Anyway, they tried to charge me double on my drinks. The waitress went back to the manager 3 times before they finally took my credit card and manually ran it with the proper bill. 

I am completely unimpressed with this Applebee's. I also assume that this chain has fallen off the caring list. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. If you are looking for a nice dinner and good atmosphere please look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Applesbees is basically one step up from a Denny's, and in fact, I think I actually like Denny's food better. The service here was very unenthusiastic.  They don't seem excited to get your business, in fact, they seem annoyed that you came in and made them work.  Gulp."}
{"text":"I have ordered before from Applebee's curbside and always received ample service but tonight was better due to a bubbly server named Bianca! I had finished my work out and was craving the Oriental Chicken Salad so I placed an order and drove over to pick it up. 

When I arrived Bianca came out to verify my order. She knew exactly what I needed in terms of extras and promptly delivered. I noticed when she gave me the total it seemed a little cheaper than usual. I asked her again what the total was and then I asked her about the strawberry lemonade I had ordered and she informed me that she did not charge me! Wow! What a treat!

Her customer service was outstanding and I was so surprised at how personable she was! I made sure tip
her well for her great service!

Needless to say my meal was delicious and my lemonade was extra good! I will return to this location in the future and hope you give it a try too!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had at an Applebee's location. I have not visited an Applebee's for awhile. We decided to try a new theatre across the street so we just wanted a quick bite from not eating all day. We sat waited, waitress took our drinks order then another came ten minutes later and took our order. It took them 45 minutes to bring our food out and I didn't even have all the items with my meal. My husbands food was bland I felt so bad I asked him if he wanted to switch with my meal. Manager claim he was going to take the food off the bill That were missed but never did. I didn't even stay to contest I just paid and left. It was 7pm and it was wasn't crowded for the wait we had. I will not be attending this location again."}
{"text":"Me and my family came here for lunch.  Have not been to this location before.  We all had the Philly cheese steak with the beer cheese.  Very delicious.  Our waiter Spencer,  was outstanding.  Very friendly and helpful.  He is part of a dying breed of waiters that actually care about the customer.  I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Crapplebee's is right!  I joined a colleague here for a quick lunch and I'll likely not make that mistake twice.  The service was minimal, the restaurant was dirty and the food was horrible.  My salad was filled with wilted lettuce and my water tasted funny.  I could have gotten a better salad from McDonald's at half the price.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I wish it was possible to give NO stars! Service was slow; most of the items we were interested in were out of stock.. what a joke!!! I won't be back and I suggest you don't waste your time either!"}
{"text":"OK, I know! Its Applebees. Corporate America Grumble Grumble. Having said that, allow me to say this: This particular Applebee's is not so bad. Happy Hour Deals are good & all the bartenders are my age! That's a good thing. I love that I have something more in common with my bartender than Booze! I grow weary of young cocky \" I am God\" bartenders so it's quite refreshing to have a bit more to chat about. 
As I said earlier, the Happy Hour deals are good. My husband & I each had 2 Stella's & we shared an order of wings. Our bill came to only Twelve Dollars! Not To Shabby, I will Go Back Again!!!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty bad. The waitress took a really long time and she overcharged us. I usually like Applebee's but I'm gonna drive the extra 10 minutes to a different location."}
{"text":"This restaurant's staff is undertrained and there are mistakes on one out of every two orders. If you order to go, and there's any mistakes, management will not credit you. You must drive back to get it corrected. Not cool. Also, for curbside, the order hardly ever ontime and there is no urgency to take care of you. Then the food is cold. I'm done."}
{"text":"The worst meal ever - meat was rubbery and broccoli was over seasoned with garlic and ? - way over cooked.  I will never return -"}
{"text":"I came to Applebee's just to relax before going to play a game of pool.  The bartender Micheal was very helpful in tell me the local pool halls.  The atmosphere was very nonchalant and casual.  It is certainly a family resturant this time of day but enjoyable.  This Applebee's is a little smaller than I expected but they make up for it in service."}
{"text":"What happened? Went by today to get some french onion soup and it was closed. Remodel? Can someone let me know?"}
{"text":"I always get great service here. Since we have a little one, my husband and I really appreciated our waitress letting me order off the happy hour menu even though we could not sit at the bar. I think her name was Cheyenne.  I prefer this Applebee's to other locations."}
{"text":"I shouldn't say that it was the worst service. Our waitress was nice but her service was sloooooowwwwwwwwww. I mean, she took our drink orders, came back with the drinks and took off. About 10 min. later she took our appetizers. She said she would be back for our dinner orders. Appetizers came out, we finished it and now waiting on our waitress to take our dinner order. About another 15 min after completing our appetizers, our waitress comes by to refill our drinks only to say she will be back for our dinner order. After waiting longer we finally get our dinner order in and food comes out quick. Everyone loved their food except 2 of us. Waitress didn't bother to come back to check on us. The manager came by and asked how we were and I wanted to say something. But some family members don't like confrontation so they would quickly say it was fine. Our waitress was there and present when it came to the check though. We were going to split the bill as discussed and give a 10% tip. Even though she was slow, it is not nice to leave no tip. As we were packing up to leave, I told my husband I can't believe she still has a job with how slow she is at waiting tables. I didn't realize how loud I was until another server chimed in and said our waitress is the manager's daughter and she gets away with everything. So yeah, food is okay, depending on what you order. Just don't be served by the managers daughter. Unless you have around over 2 hours of your time to dine."}
{"text":"I went in for a dinner pick up for two tonight. Long story short, I dropped one of my food items in the car and thought it hadn't been placed in with the order. The manager there was outstanding in his handling of the situation, he is exemplary of how to deal with unhappy customers, despite what was in this case, an error on my part. The new burgers are delicious, the staff is courteous and this place has a great atmosphere. While I waited for my order, the manager came to update me on the progress of the preparation. Food is delicious, place is great and the service is immaculate!"}
{"text":"My wife and go here often. They are always friendly and they have never had an issue with me being in uniform. The food is prepared well and always tastes good. The manager always says hello and the servers seem generally happy to be at work."}
{"text":"Applebee's has great drinks and appetizers are great prices. When we visited on 1/7/16 we were served by Steven. After visiting here multiple times, we all agree that he is the best server/bartender we've had. He is very genuine and knows when to check on his tables. :] Great service!"}
{"text":"Order a drink... you will need it to choke down the terrible food. From horrible tasting food to poor service, you'll get it here. We were not given menus when sat, our kids plates were so hot that I got burned, and very long wait times for a very small portion. Our waitress was nice but not attentive. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in last night for half price appetizers. The food was good but what stood out most was the outstanding service we received. Lessa and Spencer were both serving us and they went out of their way to make our dining experience fantastic. I haven't received that level of excellent service at fine dining restaurants! We were both blown away. Thanks for a great and very affordable date night!"}
{"text":"Meh. Just passing through and stopped for a bite..place wasn't busy on a Friday dinner service which is a bad sign. Seemed dingy/ slightly dirty. My Skinny Margarita was yummy though."}
{"text":"Very bad service ....,  we didn't have to wait to get seated but our server took way too long to greet us. Once she greeted us we were ready to order... we ordered appetizers and they came out with our dinner. My son ordered mac and cheese and the meal was brought to us by the manager .. the mac and cheese had a huge paper in it .. as if it came with instructions ! I don't understand how the manager didn't see the piece of paper in the mac and cheese.. I informed the server as soon as I was able to get a hold of her .. and she brought another one out.. the manager came to say sorry but didn't offered to take the meal off the tab since my son had to wait another 10 min to eat with us.. the server never bought us refills or checked on us to make sure everything was ok.."}
{"text":"After work dinner with coworker.
Ordered: burger, brewhouse chicken and chocolate lava cake 
Not busy @5:15pm, 5-6 tables
Had to wait awhile for someone to seat us
Waiter was nice but seemed distracted the whole time.  Forgot my lemon and then condiments for burger.
Food was hot and fresh
Good experience overall."}
