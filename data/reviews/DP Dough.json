{"text":"This place is open very late at night and is very close to the ASU Tempe campus which is great being a student. They also deliver which is +++. All the Calzones are made to order so they are amazingly fresh. They also have a daily special here where a random calzone will be $5 for the day and every Wednesday it will be 2 for $10. 

I had the Sun Devil as well as the Cheezy Bacon Tots. The calzone was pretty good and piping hot. It came with a Marinara Sauce on the side which was absolutely delicious. I personally thought the calzone was a bit too heavy on the cheese but I am normally not a heavy cheese fan so that could be why. The Tots were very disappointing. They were soggy and the cheese sauce tasted like plastic.

Overall this place is good for a cheap quick eat. I personally am not that much of a fan so I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Reasonable drunk food at reasonable prices, plus they deliver. I would never get DP Dough sober, but some love it as late night study food."}
{"text":"The food is good the rating is for the workers they are kinda rude to customers and they do not have respect to others. Advise the management to check their employees, once i waited 55 mins for cheesy tots only !"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty! I'm defiantly ordering from here again! I love that they deliver Ben and Jerry's ice cream!"}
{"text":"It's a cheesy delight. If you love all type of cheese, you must check out their cheesy calzones...rest of the menu is nothing special.."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place since I am originally from New York and appreciate great Italian food. This place is FANTASTIC! I've been there twice to eat now and have REALLY enjoyed both visits. Ingredients are super fresh and the Calzones are made by hand while you wait. Only took about 10 minutes. I will make it a goal to try something new every time since there are many menu classics to choose from and endless combinations to create your own just the way you want it. Very friendly owner and employees. Restaurant is clean and new. The only thing that could make this place better is if it wasn't so far from where I live in far East Mesa BUT it IS well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I have had dp dough more than a hundred times during my freshman year. However, since then every single experience has been terrible.

I've given dp dough multiple chances, but sadly the quality of their food has plummeted.  My roommate and I would order together and then have stomachaches the next day. This happened literally every single time. What could they have been doing to the food?

One time, the driver didnt know how to get to isr... after giving him directions and waiting 2 hours, he finally found the place. And instead of walking to the door to give me the food, he asked me to walk over to his car. I almost lost my temper that time. 

But wasn't until I saw what was inside. I saw an exploded calzone with the sauce all over the place. Needless to say, I threw it out and just got late night instead. I swore that i would never order from dp dough ever again."}
{"text":"Good food but customer service is horrible. Placed an order with them and after waiting an hour and a half got a text from delivery driver saying he left food at a completely different address. Called in and let them know what happened and asked them to cancel order and put the credit back on my card. Thought all was resolved. Had to call back a second time to get credit back for the food I never received. Manager apologized and put me down for a free calzone. I called in today to get the free calzone, verified with the lady taking my order that she saw I was owed a free one. Delivery driver showed up asking for payment for the food because it wasn't comped."}
{"text":"I'l just leave it at this....once I graduated, I had friends delivering buffer zones to me from Champaign to Chicago on the reg."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here several times. The food is usually pretty good, but I honestly never have received my order correctly. I work in the food industry and never tried to make too much of a big deal out of it. We've called them several times about topping, and sides that we paid for not being with our food. They told us they'd give us free cheesy bread next time. So we ordered tonight, and We didn't receive the sides we paid for, and specifically asked to be sure they put in. We also didn't receive the pop we paid for. On top of all of that, the food was made poorly. Both calzones had so little toppings in them that we couldn't even bring ourselves to eat them because it was just eating cheese and dough. One half of the Falling Rock Calzone that we got, literally only had cheese in it. I don't understand why this is such a problem every single time we order. Maybe instead of throwing free cheesy bread at us, speak with your staff about their laziness. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Dp dough is always so quick, consistent and the delivery personnel are great. One of the few places in Tempe I order from often because they get the order right!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for your night time calzone cravings!

Calzones and wings are really good, arrives hot and fresh, and in a very timely manner!"}
{"text":"I had the end zone and it was solid. One calzone from here is plenty for one person. Also, the cookies are worth trying."}
{"text":"I generally like the food I order from here. My calzone this time was a little more bread than I'd like, but by the time I got to the good part I was happy. My issue is that I don't remember the last time this place didn't mess up some part of my order. This time I wanted italian crust, got regular, making it bland. Last time I didn't get any marinara, again making it bland. The time before that I got the wrong meat. The time before that my friends didn't get their salads delivered in our group order. It goes on. I don't need a perfect meal every time, but always having some part of my order messed up by them sours my experience. Their inattention to detail is more consistent than their ability to make a simple meal."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Delivery. I've never actually gotten to eat the food because each time I've tried to order the wait time for delivery was 2 hours."}
{"text":"ordered half a pound of chicken tenders for 6.00 and got 4 tenders. ridiculous. they were cold."}
{"text":"great place! great delivery, the pizza dough is crispy and soft. I love thier sausage calzone."}
{"text":"SO and I ordered again, and the calzones were much greasier this time and generally less tasty. We also tried the cheese bread sticks which neither of us liked."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Their customer service was shotty and was acting aggressive when asked to repeat an order. There call service sucks and is assholes fuck them they suck"}
{"text":"I wanted Italian, not a a micrwave Hot Pocket, if you want a Gourmet Hot Pocket, go to Cornish Pasty.  These are, in no description of the word, a Calzone.  Flaverless, overbreaded quissedia (even including the 4 add-ins of meat I never tasted) pockets.  Ordered some hot wings....no flavor and think they were boiled.  Out of business in less than a year!  No stars!!"}
{"text":"The customer service here sucks...

I went in to pick up my food. The cashier (black guy, around 20-22, buzz cut in case his manager sees this) had his back to me so I said, \"Hi, I'm here to pick up my order\". He turns around, rolls his eyes, and doesn't say a word. I tell him my name, he gets my food, and puts it on the counter. I've been here a few times and normally the cashier or any decent person says something like \"Do you need a bag?\", \"It looks like you already paid online\", \"Alright have a good one\". You know...actually OPENS their mouth to acknowledge a paying customer. But the guy just stares at me for a few seconds then shoves the boxes of food across the counter towards me, and back around. He never said a word. 

Dude, if you hate people this much, why are you working the cash register?

This is the third time I've been to DP Dough had a different employee act like they don't know how to deal with people. It's not all of the employees but it's enough that I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Waited over two hours for delivery with zero communication from the store. Called to cancel and they talked to me as though it was my fault they were too busy. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Was visiting from SF Bay Area and was told to go here by friends and so glad we did. Hands down the best calzones I've ever had! Awesome menu with tons of combos to choose from. I ordered the sun devil zone calzone with pepperoni sausage, Italian spice, and mozzarella cheese! Huge servings! Dough was amazing. Great for the next tail gate party! The owner Jardin's a really cool guy! Quick service and fun atmosphere. Loved every bite! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love how it's open until 2:30 am, so if all the other restaurants are closed when you should probably be asleep anyway, you can always come here. I used order from D.P. Dough when I was living in another state, so when I found out there was one here, I was ecstatic! The guy working there was great! He was very helpful and friendly, and I give him props for staying cool even after being the only one in the shop, aside from the delivery guy who came and left; it wasn't too busy anyway. 

I ordered the first one (and only one) I could remember off the top of my head: the Cheeseburg Zone with tomato added in. I burnt myself twice trying to eat it as soon as I had it in front of me. It was delicious! It tasted almost like I remembered it and the marinara sauce helped to cool it down. Wasn't greasy either. The only thing that irked me was that I remember it being fuller. I mean, there was definitely some spillage. Not here though."}
{"text":"Today our order took an hour and a half to get here, and once it got here the chicken wings were soggy and cold. The calzones were undercooked. And on top of it all one calzone was missing, and we were offered only a refund or a calzone (2 hours after our order was placed)."}
{"text":"I have probably been to DP Dough more than any other eating establishment in my life. This was mainly due to the fact that it was pretty cheap, close to my apartment, and satisfied every drunken desire that I had. Because I went there so often, I knew what worked for me and what did not work for me. I was a big fan of the Black & Blue (tastes like a burger with blue cheese), the mangus (pesto and pepperoni), the titan (pesto and pineapple), and the buffer zone (blue cheese, hot sauce, etc). There was only one or two times where I was not completely satisfied with any of these. My friends were all big fans of the Barbecue Chicken zone. I have eaten it twice. The first time I was less than satisfied because of all the hype, but the second time I was happy with my decision. For the most part, the calzones were delicious. There were a couple times where they may have been a little undercooked, but I preferred that over being burned to a crisp.

As for cons, there are times where the service is very slow. This is mainly because as a \"drunk food\" establishment, people normally order between the hours of 1-3 AM, when this place is bumpin'. It will generally take 30-45 minutes when you order at this time to get your food so plan accordingly otherwise you will be forced to observe the happenings at Green Street Cafe. Other issues people may have with the staff. I would not say that any interaction I have had has been particularly friendly, but I always just took that as how the environment there was.

DP Dough was a large part of my collegiate experience and I have no regrets about all the money that I spent there."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!!! I ordered from these people last night and they sent out the wrong order! And they wouldn't even send anybody out to give me my order! All they could say is \"sorry\". So pissed"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. The driver was professional. Food was right out of the oven. Nice quantity and quality. Reasonable price, and they do not overcharge for delivery fees. 

Marinara is really really good!"}
{"text":"Construction calzones are really good. Their cookies are damn tasty. Reasonable price and quick delivery."}
{"text":"DP Dough is a lifesaver.  They have a big selection of calzones, and on the off chance you don't see one you like, you can also custom design one (known as \"Construction Zone\" where you can have up to 4 ingredients).  Personally, my mouth just waters whenever I look over the menu and have to remember that these things are very filling so I can't order the 5 different calzones I'd like to try.  I'm trying to work my way through the list, but so far my favorites include the Testing Zone (breaded chicken, pesto, mozzarella) and a combination of the Veggie Zone and Parking Zone (broccoli, breaded chicken, mushrooms, mozzarella).

All the calzones are made fresh the moment you order them, are absolutely delicious, and only cost $6.  They're definitely perfect for when you need got the munchies, are studying late at night, or when you discover you're actually really hungry after a night out at the bars, and even better?  They deliver late!!!

Monday - Wednesday until 2am
Thursday - Saturday until 3am
Sunday until 1am

They do lose some points for their turnover time though.  It takes them upwards of an hour to get the food delivered to you - the reason for which is because they need to make and bake your order first before they can get it out to you.  The plus side to this though, is that your calzone arrives fresh and piping hot with the cheese in the middle still oozing out when you take a bite."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to these 'zones.  They have a huge menu of different varieties or you can make your own.  Every day of the week has a different special."}
{"text":"I ordered the pepperoni calzone with onion and spinach. There were 5 pieces of pepperoni inside. They stuff it with cheese and spinach and was very stingy on the pepperoni. Will never go here again. For $10 it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"I am crazy for a good calzone.
These aren't anything to get worked up about.

The fillings are fair (though I'd love to see green olives on the menu). The crust was very dense--too dense. Maybe not cooked well enough. All the other calzones I've ever had had a nicely browned, semi-crispy top. This one was almost the consistency of Wonder Bread. Top this with a super bland marinara sauce, and you've got a mouth full of disappointment. 

The cheese sticks were pretty tasty. If anything else about our order had been up to snuff, we would have thought of ordering these again.

The apple pie sticks are a waste of your life. Just burn some cheap, whole-wheat toast and pour some canned apple pie filling on it."}
{"text":"First time here, and it was absolutely awesome! Very friendly guy running it, and the food is top notch. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Don't understand the many negative reviews. DP Dough is fantastic and one of the only places in the area to get a good calzone. They frequently run deals ($5.50 calzones) through online ordering and you get A LOT of food. The calzones are incredibly fresh and filling. It has that \"drunk food\" reputation, and don't get me wrong it fits that bill as well, but it's fantastic in any state. Don't plan on dining in, however. They have a tiny awkward little counter that you hypothetically could eat at, but you'd be the first person I've seen doing it."}
{"text":"We ordered from DP dough last night, for the first time. The delivery took over an hour, and we only live two blocks away (yes we know we're lazy, but in our defense, we were also very intoxicated). The girl who took the order, quoted us 25 mins, so after 50 mins of waiting, we called back in, to make sure our order had actually been placed. When the calzones arrived they needed to be heated up! They were offensively cold. I would recommend Gus's Pizza delivery over this place any day! Maybe it's better when you can actually go there, instead of wasting so much time waiting for cold calzones.  The quality of the food (once re-heated) was the only part of the experience that earned it any stars at all. My advice, just stick with pizza!"}
{"text":"They're open crazy late, it was perfect because we needed a late night dinner/snack.  The calzones were good, and filled with a lot of toppings.  

Everything, even the cookies are made fresh to order, so you have to wait a second for them to cool.  It was hard to do because they smelled SO GOOD!!

I recommend the Sun Devil calzone.   Simple, lots of meat and cheese, and marinara to dip was good.

I want to try their wings!!  We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Everything's amazing. period.
The cookies are warm and delicious and the chocolate chips just melt in your mouth. The calzones are great! They have online ordering which is very convenient if you're looking for a meal while at the library or something."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, in his haze of sickness, committed to bed rest on a limited diet, suddenly sat up and said, \"Have you had DP Dough?\"  I had no idea what he was talking about.

Apparently calzones are the cure for all ills because he got up and told me to look up the menu and that we had to go - and he was right.  Oh my gosh, DP Dough's calzones are good! Namely because I haven't had many opportunities to try calzones!

We ordered three calzones that lasted for two days:

Combat 'Zone (pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, mushroom & mozzarella) which was a solid calzone but not my favorite.

End 'Zone (steak, onion, green pepper and mozzarella) that I wanted to steal from my boyfriend because it was technically his.

Maui Wow (ham, pineapple & mozzarella) my favorite! You must get this!

Each calzone was made with white flour, and came with a nice cup of tomato sauce that I wished was twice as big.

The menu is huge so I plan to go back for more 'zones, and to try them made with the garlic crust."}
{"text":"I've been trying to hit up more places that have vegan options because of my vegan gf. This place definitely hits the spot for hungry vegans looking to get a nice portion of food and save money! Most vegan joints skimp on the amount of food and charge up the ass for a simple burger and fries. This place though... So happy I found this spot and will be coming back! Service was good, the guy behind the counter was fast and polite. There's also a chalk board you can write or draw stuff on."}
{"text":"Writing this review with calzone grease on my fingers because I had to say how great they are!

I was worried about ordering because of all the bad delivery reviews, but they were here in 30mins (11:30pm on a Monday night.) The calzones are solid for the price and i would definitely order again. I had two, late night gluttony got the best of me, the Maui Wowi and a classic Italian, they were great and I would get the maui again for sure, it was over flowing with cheese and sweet pineapple SO GOOD! The classic italinan was just fine.

Only sad thing is the delivery guy didn't bring my extra marinara that they charge 75 cents for, I know it's a little petty but if you're going to charge me you better bring it! but my pettiness will not stop my 5 star review of the food."}
{"text":"I'm officially addicted. I usually get the ham and pineapple bit the roni rolls are awesome, my new favorite."}
{"text":"Never order their Buffalo chicken salad! Menu stated that it came with deviled eggs. I got a few pieces of dried up hard boiled egg. Menu does not state that the chicken is breaded--I would of never ordered it--and low quality, processed mystery chunks. They haphazardly sprinkle on some cheap cheese, and then have the nerve to charge $10 for this sad excuse of an entree salad. Shameful. This is a total bait and switch. Save your money!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and very speedy service."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for this place paid 13 bucks for 20 bucks worth of food. This place was not special and none of my family enjoyed it. Over priced with the groupon and WAY over priced with out it for what you get. I will not be back. I gave 2 stars because they were quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"Great and timely delivery. Called to inform me they had ran out of a dish but were willing to customize another one for me. Delivery person was also the happiest one I've seen for someone who is working at 2am in the morning."}
{"text":"Good food. But delivery time is awful. Waited around 2+ hours only for it to never show up at all. No phone call no notice whatsoever. 
Please I highly recommend you alter your delivery operations."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Their calzones are delicious and I never had a problem with their staff - all super helpful and friendly. I had a bad calzone a few months ago, but chalked it up it maybe just being a stomach virus or something.   I decided to give them another shot.  I ordered a calzone and a side salad.  I took a grand total of maybe 3 bites before I realized there was a HUGE moth/other kind of dead bug in my salad.  Needless to say, I threw it out and am totally grossed out.  I don't know what has happened to this place in the past few months, but....stay away!"}
{"text":"Well, let's begin.

Food in this place is good to satisfy your Italian food cravings. Definitely not a traditional \"must to go\" place, I mean, it is a fast food Italian restaurant.

Having said that, customer service is nerve racking. :D 

You will experience an amazing feeling of anxiety while you enjoy a great feeling of hunger. YUM!!
You will have the chance to appreciate an epic unorganisation. (Skip your order or get it wrong).

Time to get any order, at any time will take forever, to be fair, they are extremely busy most of the time.

Have fun and BUON APPETITO!"}
{"text":"Just had some pretty great calzones. Had the chicken parm for myself, it was wonderful no hard parts and no bones and super cheesy! My mom had the spinner zone and she was awesome. Fresh spinach and great amount of cheese and light crust. My boyfriend had the Danger Zone and he says the perfect amount of spice. We ordered the apple pie zone but we're all too full to eat it so we will save it for later. Delivery guy was also determined to find out where our apartment was unlike most delivery drivers. I am very pleased. Tequila the chihuahua also approves of the chicken parm. Will order online again!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with this place. We used to come here when it was Gus pizza but haven't been around since we don't live in this side of town. We decided after the fight to go to get pizza since everything else would be close. We were surprised to see it was closed and D.P dough had replaced we were hungry and decided to give it a try. Thank goodness we did this place is awesome very clean and very friendly. I had the Italian absolutely delicious and my boyfriend had the pepperoni very good too. We also had their homemade cookies which they make when you order them and oh my goodness sooooo good. This place is worth the drive and we will be back."}
{"text":"The calzones are decent... the cookies are phenom.
Worth a shot for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered and had an emergency so couldn't be there for delivery. So I'm out money and never got jack shit. Thanks dp"}
{"text":"I'm leading the crusade against restaurants that have a hard time including plastic utensils and napkins in orders being delivered to hotel rooms. I specifically requested in my order to include forks and napkins and I got neither. The food was fine but eating all of it with my hands is un-effing-acceptable. It's a hotel, I shockingly do not carry silverware with me when I travel. How hard is this to comprehend?"}
{"text":"Easy ordering online and quick delivery! I have tried a few of their calzones and they are all good!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out thru Grub Hub. Everything was great wish I would have added topping to calzone. The jalapeño cheese knots were my favorite. Will be curious to try the rest of the menu. Thank you DP."}
{"text":"The best calzone I've ever had.  Ranch buffer is the way to go.  I love all the dipping sauces, too! (Marinara and hot are at the top of my list).

Quick service and decent price for the size.  Lots of options."}
{"text":"You shouldn't expect too much from a corner pick-up restaurant like this. Not a lot of seats inside, so I'd suggest picking up (ordering through Eat Street seems to be most convenient) or getting delivery.

The calzones are amazing. Definitely not the place to come if you're trying to eat healthy, but a place to come in and splurge. $6 calzones through the Eat Street app as well, so they're on the cheaper side.

Customer service is what you'd expect. They like to loudly play music in there, so you either like it or you don't, but I'm usually in and out of there in a minute when I'm picking up so I've never had any issue!

In all, amazing food, especially for the price. Can't really beat it."}
{"text":"Location isn't the best but I ordered out from here many times. Very tasty calzones. I recommend the Italian! Haven't tried any others :/"}
{"text":"Asked delivery driver if he had change for a 20 said no and walked away with it wtf????? food came very cold and soggy if you're going to take a hour and a half to deliver something at least make sure the food isn't soggy cold and sad...."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! The roni zoni is my go to and they have the best cookies! The manager Kyle is also amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious- Friendly Staff-Yummy Cookies- Many options...plus my vegan fam can come"}
{"text":"I created my calzone and it was mainly just cheese even though I had a variety of other ingredients. It was pretty good but was essentially glorified cheese bread. Delivery was super fast and the delivery driver was cute heehee."}
{"text":"My Calzone was hot and made to order. The dough was very tasty and not too crunchy or too soft. I had the steak with onion and peppers calzone (I think it was called the drop zone) and I couldn't be happier. It's very filling and I almost couldn't finish it although I was very hungry. Very friendly staff and the owner himself was there and greeted me and made sure everything was OK. I would definitely recommend this place and will come back again!"}
{"text":"S'pretty good. Inexpensive food. Great calzones. The seating area is adequate. They have my favorite brand of tea there. They run all sorts of specials constantly. 

Great for the college student or person looking for hot food on the go."}
{"text":"As study-binge food goes, DP Dough is a good choice. No pizza, but their calzones are just as good and they have a huge variety of options. Their wings are baked instead of fried, which means its a slightly less guilty treat and they are actually quite delicious. 

The surprise here? Their fresh-baked cookies are actually better than the better-known Insomnia Cookies. Big and chewy, they make a great dessert after you binge on wings and calzones."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I used to like it more but then i got sick one night eating their cheese clazone. Maybe dirty hands prepared my calzone? old cheese? idk? The calzone was good just not for my stomach that night. The buffalo wings are cheap and pretty good. The tater tots are probably the best thing to eat here since you cant fuck up an order of tots."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are such nice people and they make awesome calzones! Pretty cheap in price. They make everything fresh right in front of you and have a wide variety. They're open suuuper late and deliver which is super great being a college student."}
{"text":"I have been here a so times and surprised I haven't written a review yet. If you want something cheesy filled with carbs this is the place to be. They are really good about getting all of the ingredients mixed in the calzone instead of one side has all the cheese while the other has all the meat, it's always evenly distributed. Perfect hangover food."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, their calzone is really good!
I order the spinach calzone. It's full of cheese and spinach. I might come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, the food came quickly and customer service was great. The Ronizone lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Okay so one night I was craving for some Italian food and couldn't find any restaurant open for delivery. Uber eats happened to be delivering in my area and I gave it a try. The only Italian food restaurant open was dp dough. I really wasn't interested in a calzone but they had great reviews and I had no other choice. I ordered a passing zone and my bf ordered a cheeseburger zone with a. Cookie. My calzone was surprisingly dry due to it having no sauce on the inside. I poured the \"marinara sauce\" inside and it taste like pure tomato paste which wasn't very Italian-y like I was expecting. 

Don't get me wrong my calzone was good. But maybe I ordered a bad one. I will give it another try but I wasn't extremely impressed. My bf liked his so no complaints there. 

So.... That cookie though. I can't express how incredibly good it was. Fresh baked. Soft yet crispy. OMFG. I will be back just for that. I hate you dp dough. That was so unnecessary."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was recommended to me by a friend and I could no be happier about my experience. Deliver was at a timely manner and the calzone is phenomenal. The dunkers are a little soggy, but I did get them tossed in sauce. If you want them crispy make sure you get the sauce on side. Other then that I give this place a 5 star. Hard to find someone to deliver a calzone these days. Thank you dpdough!"}
{"text":"Ben Wyatt would not approve. I ordered a firecracker calzone for delivery, paid 15% tip and my total was $10.92. It was just barely warm when I received it and the box was all soggy from the condensation. I had maybe 5 jalapenos in the whole 'zone. The sausage is super weird and leaves a terrible aftertaste. I think I've developed TMJ from the amount of effort I had to put into chewing the crust. This was my first and only time trying DP Dough. My mouth now tastes like a spicy armpit and I am not impressed."}
{"text":"This place has amazing calzones! Some of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place to grab a bite to eat. :)"}
{"text":"6 wings only? And very small not crispy. The cinna stix were a little plain. Icing was good atleast.

Tried them again. And delivery took 2 hours missing side sauce. Terrible"}
{"text":"Worst wings ever! We got both bone in and bone out. 12 dollars is highway robbery here. The bone out tasted like Tyson or Banquet microwaved wings with sauce added. The bone in was all chewy fat. So gross. The breadsticks were pretty good, so if you come here I'd suggest getting those. Thanks but no thanks!"}
{"text":"I order at least once a month. Drivers are always great. Calzones are hit or miss. Sometimes they are full of toppings & cheese, sometimes they are not. Sometimes the sauce is spicy (which is great) and sometimes it's not, which is ok too. 
Order online for their \"heart\" program for free food.
Look for specials,  I believe Wednesday is $5 calzones day."}
{"text":"Loved this place! $5 calzone of the day (Italian). $1.25 very large cookie as well. The owner Michael Ratzken was very considerate and tending to all of my needs."}
{"text":"DP was my very favorite place to get food from when I was here, drunk or sober. I probably ate there once a week almost.  Ordered it yesterday and first of all it was over priced. $30 for 2 calzones and 2 orders of tots. Whatever, I assure my boyfriend it would be worth it. Boy, was I wrong. I got the ranch buffer and it was so dry. There was hardly anything to fill it. Definitely didn't taste like there was any ranch in there at all. It was so bland and boring.  I now remember I used to tell them I wanted ranch instead of marinara (shouldn't that just be standard? Do people really eat buffalo chicken anything with marinara? Serious question.) also, it would have been cheaper just to get the hot box deal with tots and sodas. Explain to me how it's almost half the price if you ADD another item (a can of soda). Also, the customer service part of the person taking the order should have been like \"hey I see you are getting 2 calzones and tots, it's half the price if you add sodas.\"

Overall just really disappointed. And sad. DP Dough was the one place I wanted to eat at while in Champaign. And while I wouldn't have minded $30 for the DP dough that was used to, to say our experience was disappointing is an understatement."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new the other day, and ended up here. While I was impressed with the staff and the flavor of my meal, I was quite disappointed with the quality. One quarter off my calzone was empty.  The manager/owner offered me a free calzone on my next visit to make up for it. I will be returning to give them another shot."}
{"text":"I will never ever come back to this pathetic attempt at a D.P dough. I say this attempt because the DP dough in normal is simply fantastic. The food is great, the staff is amazing, and I've never ever had a bad experience. However this location is by far the armpit of the chain. 

Where do I start with this walking crap factory? How about the guy behind the counter. So if you want to blast music in your work place I'm very okay with that, especially if it's 90s alt rock. What I'm not okay with is an employee who doesn't even attempt to speak up when you ask a question. He stood there looked at me with the dumbest face and mumbled his response. What was my question? I asked, \"Do you guys still make the hot dog and Mac and cheese one\" his response, \"yeah\". Couldn't hear him but I assumed that's what he said. My girlfriend ordered the Reggie. And then he looked at me waiting for me to order and I said the hot dog and Mac and cheese one we just spoke about. He then mumbled the order total, couldn't hear him again so I just handed him my card. 

The wait. 20 minutes for 2 calzones. As we waited I watched the beautiful machine at work. 6-7 guys all of them college aged walking around some of them half asleep some of them couldn't care less what they were doing, if one of them was a manager I sure as hell couldn't tell. So we waited and waited and waited and waited. And finally the food came!!!

The food. Okay so I'm pretty sure the people that work at this dp dough have never seen a calzone before because the thing was more breading than meat. The thing was flat, burnt, had holes in it, and it was guess what, not what I ordered. Instead of the hot dog and Mac and cheese I was given the pulled Pork and Mac and cheese... So this all could have been avoided if the guy working the counter A. Cared about his job B. Spoke up in a loud room C. Wasn't apathetic about his job D. Had any sense of manners E. Wasn't hung over or possibly stoned. Or F. All of the above. 

The answer is F and that's what I give this rotten hole of an establishment. I will never return and I will do everything in my power to dissuade people from coming to this place. I guess I was spoiled in Normal with, you know a DP dough that didn't suck complete and total ass."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that it was not super greasy! It was really delicious. We did have to wait a while and we received one wrong order, but we understood they seemed to be understaffed and the wrong calzone ended up being delicious!!


I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My favorite is the speed zone. Staff is friendly and offered recommendations. Hoping their delivery area expands south of the 60 soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but I recommend putting it in the oven for about 10 min at 450 degrees when you get it because it's always only lukewarm and super soft (almost soggy) because the delivery service is soooo bad. Consistently takes 2+ hours to get to me and I live 5 min down the street. No matter how many times you call it's always \"on its way\" or \"should be there any minute\" just to get you off the phone..."}
{"text":"They have super chill employees. If you treat them like people they are very nice. The food is always on point and super fast. DP RULES!"}
{"text":"I paid for extra ranch. They charged me for extra ranch. If I pay for something I better get it! I don't care whether it's $100 or one penny, if you promised something you better deliver. I called thrice to complain and got put on hold every time. I am VERY unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I love dp so much! I always see the same two guys working late night and they're always very nice. Foods always great never had a problem in anyway. Forever greatful that they're open. Such a great spot and great concept for a restaurant. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT btw music is bomb"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. They had one back home in Colorado while I was going to CSU & it is hands down my favorite calzone place. Went there yesterday & it was just as good as I remembered. Close to my house and right by campus too. 
Gonna have to try to resist going there all the time. 
I love their options for calzones! So many & all so good!
They deliver and stay open late which is a definite plus.
I recommend trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"Cool staff, hard working and friendly. The cookies are amazing! Baked fresh on the spot, can you say heaven?"}
{"text":"Ok so I came here for the first time a few days ago, mostly because we've gotten so many coupons for them and we wanted cinnamon stix. I've always had an aversion to this place, because how good could they be if they give free stuff away all the time? I also thought it was a place that would only taste good if you're drunk and its past 2am. But I was wrong!!
The calzones are really good, and they don't have sauce inside them. I prefer them this way, but some people get upset there's no sauce inside... 
Anyways, the fresh baked cookies are also great and huge too! 
Honestly all the food was delicious, it's not fancy foodie food but it has a home-y taste that will appeal to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has the worst delivery service. Once you order online you are told your order will arrive 30-45 min later. Every single time I order I always end up waiting a minimum of an hour and a half. I'll usually call too, and they will say \"it just went out, it will be there in a few min\". I'd understand if I lived far, but I literally live 7 min away. The only reason why I continue to order is because no where else will deliver Ben and jerrys ice cream at 3 am."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hot Box Special, with a Spinner 'Zone (spinach calzone), fries, and a can of Cherry Coke. The total came to $9 with tax.

I got a lot more food than I expected, but with less flavor than I would have liked. I was stuffed after eating 2/3 of the calzone, half of the fries, and all of the sauce. There was only a smidgen of spinach (mostly cheese and dough), and since I like tomato sauce, not enough of it. The soda was a splurge since I don't drink it often, but it's really not necessary.

I would recommend saving a few dollars by not getting the combo, and instead getting just a calzone and an extra container of sauce for $0.60. That would put it on par with about 3 slices of decent pan style cheese pizza folded up. Think twice about paying more for toppings, because they were inconsequential in my order.

Bottom line: I'm not planning on ever going back, but I don't feel sick or cheated, either."}
{"text":"Awful service! Placed an order well before they even closed and here it is closing time and still no order. I don't understand why it takes over an hour to make something. Never had an issue before with DP until today. This most likely will be my last time ordering with them. Terrible."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Over an hour late, and the \"cinnamon bread\" didn't only taste like it had been left out for days, it looked like it too. Stale, no flavor, and cold. My roommate grabbed a bite and asked how long it had been sitting out, assuming it came from the same company as the old pizza box sitting in the recycle bin from days prior. Wrong. It was supposedly \"fresh.\" The calzones were at least consistent with this. (Side note, for a place that says they specialize in \"calzones\" their menu sure does consist of a lot of strombollis) The \"calzones\" tasted like they had been mass produced and set out in stacks so that delivery drivers could \"grab-and-go\" which meant chewy dough, and grease that was starting to solidify. Absolutely disgusting. Never again will I order from this place. I would recommend you stay away, and let this fad die out and leave the quick pizza business to the people who have been doing it successfully for years. Do. Not. Buy."}
{"text":"I used to love DP Dough and thought the calzones were amazing! However, the last few times I have been there my calzone has been subpar. The edges where the dough meets have become thicker, leaving big chunks of dough with no filling. The actual filling is stuffed with too much cheese so that i have to pull cheese out of my calzone to enjoy it (I have found asking for light cheese makes it more palatable). Last time I was there, I got my calzone to go and when I got home to eat it, it was filled with a strange cheese... Not the mozzarella like my usual order comes with. The cheese was a thin liquid! It was very strange and I did not enjoy my meal. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Can't believe they call themselves \"The Original Calzone Company\".  Guess that doesn't mean quality though as I got the flattest calzone I've ever had from anywhere.  Guess the joke is on me.  Name definitely doesn't dictate quality here.  If u want the best calzone & fullest/fattest then go to Babbo as theirs is phenomenal.
Don't waste your $ at DP Dough, as that's all u get."}
{"text":"Good calzones, open late at night, students like me have a good option there. The service is prompt, and I like their $5 calzone a day deal. The spinach calzone is awesome!"}
{"text":"D. P.  Dough pre doughpocalypse review: Stopped on the way home to see what it was like before the chaos of tomorrow. Ordered the calzone of the day, which happened to be the Italian, and a half dozen wings to go. Added parm garlic seasoning to the zone'. Owner was super friendly and they had calzone boxes stacked to the ceiling. Order was ready in less than 10 minutes. 

Calzone was really good, with a light, airy, slightly chewy crust, the creamy ricotta being the standout ingredient. Tomato sauce was thin and tangy, compliments the zone well. While the wing buffalo sauce was tasty, the wings were on small side and baked, decent but forgettable. Bonus points for their fleet of electric bike scooter things for delivering. 

8/10 solid"}
{"text":"Order food through postmates tonight. I order a calzone and tatertots. When I opened my order after he delivered I noticed t was the complete wrong order. I live about 15 minutes north in old town Scottsdale. I called and asked for a manager to let them know of the mistake and that the guys order I got he either got my order or is never going to receive the order. The gentleman I spoke with didn't seem to worried of this mistake and asked what he could do to fix it. I told him it wasn't like he was going to deliver it that far and he just let it go instead of trying to make it right some how. For what I was delivered it was good. Wish it was what I wanted though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the best calzone I've ever had there. Make sure to add the seasoning to the crust, it was out of this world. Also there chocolate chip cookies to finish off are amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! I had the Sun Devil Zone and it was tasty! There are lots of different options and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? I've tried ordering on their site and it no longer works. Also tried calling and there is no answer. I'd drive by but I live 40 miles away. Anyone with any info? They have the best zones in the world."}
{"text":"I like this place, they bake to order and have a really creative menu. I should have come here on Pie day!"}
{"text":"The calazones are awesome and i recommend for others to check out their deal of the day calendar (sometimes you can get a calazone for $5--- which can def. fill you up!). The only thing that can be improved is the delivery. Sometimes you have to go out and run around looking for the delivery person (its not the delivery person's fault though). DP dough is open late which is nice too. Really good staff. the name though reminds me of this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJfqxlUTeXc"}
{"text":"So this is the second time this has happened here. We place an order(through Postmates this time) and the order shows up half complete. Today it was a salad. Called DP Dough and instead of getting a chance to talk to someone about it I was relayed a message from a manager that was too occupied to handle what can be considered a small theft considering they decided it wasn't their fault. Postmates dude didn't have anything else in his bag so it never made it to the dude. It's only like 10 bucks but on the real. At least hop on the phone and let your customer hear you tell them you fucked up and there is nothing you can do about it. So yeah, this place ain't getting my money any more. Shouldn't get yours either."}
{"text":"Average calzones for an average cost. Open late, so if it's 2am and you're needing grub that isn't Denny's, this may be for you."}
{"text":"I ordered buffalo wings last night and the other lady in my party got plain wings. The wings were a complete disaster! The buffalo wings were soggy and not seasoned at all!!! I ate one and put it down. We put the wings in the oven to cook them some more and they still were awful! The breading is something I've never seen before. It's like they took them out of a package and put them in the microwave. Another person in my party got the calzone and was happy about it. But I beg of the ownership at this place; go back to square one with your wing recipe. Start all over!!!!!! Do not get package wings buy wings season and bread them yourself and then fry them. Until you do take the wings off the menu!"}
{"text":"So yeah the guy there picked up my wings with no gloves. Even though, he was using his hands with a the touch screen to process my order."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but it's just not very good.  I think they use frozen dough or something.  It just lacks good flavor. they have a lot of options and I have tried a few different options but it just doesn't help.  I enjoy a calzone at Spinato's Pizzeria much more and it's quicker even with table service.
I think DP puts a lot of care into their restaurant. The effort is there it's just the recipes they are using are not great.  With that being said they do have the best tater tots I have ever had. There isn't anything wrong with this place.  I've been there a bunch of times and I'm sure I'll go back.  I just don't love the food.  That's my personal opinion. I'm sure there are people who disagree."}
{"text":"Their delivery service was courteous and timely. I ordered some kind of meaty calzone (can't remember which.) I appreciate their whimsical menu-item names. However, my primary reason for choosing a calzone over a pizza is the crust. I like my calzones with a nice buttery garlicky shell, something that will get my fingers all greasy. This was simply bread. So while the fillings were adequate, I would say that this is a substandard calzone, and I could do much better next time."}
{"text":"Having been a regular customer my delivery was messed up. Manager refused to rectify the order and blamed his inability on the other customers he had to attend to. Ridiculously poor management and terrible customer service. It's surprising that such a big chain isn't capable of teaching their employees on how to run a store during busy hours or maybe it's just the specific Tempe branch that can't function with high volume orders."}
{"text":"The guy who took my order on the phone was a dick. Rude and he never gave me my total. it took over an hour to get my food on a Sunday night. Great food horrible service"}
{"text":"Staying in town and placed an online order at 10:55pm. Ordered some buffalo wings which were a little bland on flavor, but the bleu cheese dipping sauce was good. Made our own calzone, mozzarella and parmesan cheese with pepperoni and pineapple (my favorite). It was AMAZING. The crust was perfect and ingredients tasted great. 
BUT. I have to complain that it took just over an hour for delivery. Like.... come on. But would definitely eat here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and easy. Made custom to your likings and cooked perfectly. Great calzones!"}
{"text":"DP Dough... 

My first impression of this place was not so nice. Fist time I had their calzone, I went to their place to pick it up. The place looked bit unsanitary and I noticed that not everybody was wearing gloves or had aprons.

However, the second time a had DP Dough calzone, I ordered one. And yes, they do deliver to far destinations and work 24/7. So when you're hungry at 3am in the morning, DP Dough is what you should go for. 

I know that they have wide selection of calzones. However, I have tried only one kind, the \"Ranch Buffer\" couple of times. I remember it was pretty good (especially after several beers). I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Good clean food. Delivery is always prompt. I recommend ordering from their website. By doing so, you can earn points toward free stuff."}
{"text":"Perhaps some day, I'm going to bring my children to my alma mater, the U of I. I'm going to show them the buildings and where I lived and all the things that I experienced as an undergraduate here. And when my tour winds to a close, I will take them to the place that supplied me with countless nights of late night munchies. The place that gave me something delicious to believe in, a place that never disappointed me when I opened the box. Some day, I'm going to take my kids to DP Dough.

DP Dough itself is not really a restaurant - it is primarily for us cyber monkeys who do everything through the Internet, especially in ordering food. The restaurant itself has a small seating area that is almost always empty, and has exactly four seats.

Now to the important part - the food. Every calzone that comes out of this place is first placed at the altar of the calzone gods and given a proper blessing. Only then does it become fit for human consumption, at which point it has spontaneously morphed from an ordinary calzone into a holy image of the calzone gods themselves. The dough is baked to a perfect crisp, and all that is contained within the dough is molded from the sinews of something superhuman. These calzones have never disappointed me, and it makes me happy to know that they never will. And unless they take down their altar to the calzone gods, my children will not be disappointed either."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Biggest Calzones I've ever had. Fast delivery. Great taste. We also tried the apple pie sticks and they're so yum! They put apple pie filling inside a pizza dough and sprinkle with cinnamon. So good!"}
{"text":"The calzone was just okay. The chicken that came on it was weird. 

The delivery driver, on the other hand, no phone manners. He called, I answered. Rather than say hello, he said \"I have your food.\" He was literally standing right outside my open office door staring at me. He was rude. I won't order delivery again based off his attitude. I really don't have time to deal with someone like that."}
{"text":"I can see this place being one of those \"I'M DRUNK, GIMME SOME FOOD\" staples for UIUC students and visitors alike. Had I been drunk when I tried it, this might have been a 5-star review. But here's the lowdown from a sober perspective.
Sis & I ordered online, (there were all sorts of deals through the website and through a 3rd party... it was all a little confusing, but the 3rd party actually ended up giving us the better deal) one Safety Zone and one Spin Zone. Delivery time was right on track with what they told us (about 45 minutes). The calzones were in their own labeled boxes, and sis handed me mine (Spin). I opened the box, and then opened the calzone (which was already split in half), and yelled out in horror, \"OH DEAR GOD ITS FULL OF MUSHROOMS.\" You see, I hate mushrooms. I thought I was going to have to make an angry phone call, but it turns out they had put my calzone in the box labeled Safety, and my sister's calzone in the box labeled Spin. An easy mistake, but they really should be more careful about these kinds of things.
The food was alright. The crust was a little soggy, and I could have crisped it up in the oven, but I was just so hungry. There could have been more ricotta, but thats my personal preference. 3 stars about sums it up."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ.... I have order from them on 3 separate occasions and they have forgotten my extra ranch each time! I wouldn't care as much if they didn't charge for extra sauce. The calzones are alright but don't order extra sauce because you won't get it."}
{"text":"Good late night food, but the best part is the staff. I stopped by to do some homework late at night and the staff is very interactive and friendly. PLUS they sell Ben N Jerry's so it doesn't really get much better."}
{"text":"Calzones are delicious and rewards program is great. Would recommend doing pick up when ordering."}
{"text":"Drunk/hangover food at it's finest. It's a great value for the price and the menu is large enough to satisfy most cravings when you're in a certain state of mind. 

The calzones (I had the Titan and La-zone-ya) are not super flavorful, but absolutely good enough for the price. They also deliver until 4 am. A U of I student necessity."}
{"text":"ordered at 6:48 online and 7:54 told it was enrolled, and they don't call online orders to let them know that things were running behind....when I called the guy who answered just said \"I understand\" after ever compliant I had finally he said he would get his manger...omg really....nope never again"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience when i order from DP Dough! Their calzones are great for lunch, dinner or late night after bar drunk food bc they're open very late! And cheap! I usually order the ranch buffer with a cookie and drink for $8.50 and never had complaints! Calzone is delicious and cookie is fresh and soft. AND delivery was fast! Ordered at 2:30ish and got my food at 3pm!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Also tried 3 different calzones, one pepperoni and green peppers, another was the Hawaiian and the other was supreme. Very fast service and the owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"*Sigh*

I placed an order with DP dough, and they forgot to include a knife and fork both times.

I think at the basic level, ordering an empanada (like a Pizza Hut P-zone) requires a fork and knife. Now when I've also ordered a side salad, doesn't it REALLY make sense to include a fork at the least?

At the suggestion of a co-worker, I called the store to let them know. The guy working at the time claimed that my two-for-two experiences with no fork/knife were \"the only two times he's ever heard of a customer not getting them\". 

Yea right.

Goodbye DP Dough. You may dump loads of money into lame T.V. commercials, but your just-plain-OK food coupled with horrible logic and an apparent deficit of plastic forks and knives is unacceptable.

P.S. According to my friends, the \"DP\" stands for double penetration... and that will likely be your experience with this place."}
{"text":"They're open until 3 am and the calzones are huge so they're great for dinner then lunch the next day - also they periodically have free cookie day, no strings attached. The chicken parmazone is"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch; first time.  I looked beforehand at the menu online in preparation.  I ordered the Combat Zone calzone.  I appreciate the fact that they are all made to order and not premade so I was able to order mine without green peppers.  It was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  It DEFINATELY did not look like the picture portrayed on their website.  Mine was very plain with no seasoning on the outside and the breading itself was very course and dry.  The cheese bread was decent but I still like the cheese bread from Papa Murphy's better.  Overall I was not impressed.  I figure that their location caters primarily to college students one would assume that their standards in quality and consistency aren't a priority."}
{"text":"The hardest thing here is to decide between all these great 'Zones!   Imagine, anything you can possibly want inside a gigantic calzone crust. Look at the great photos.

Fresh, hot and bubbly cheese and your choice of additional items like chicken, beef, Italian sausages, and all kinds of vegetables.  You can also add garlic sauce and garlic-Parmesan topping.

Big enough to share for two. You won't want to though.

Been here a number of times trying out different combinations and each week they are better. This week I am trying the PassingZone!  Chicken, bacon, ranch, fresh tomatoes...yummm!

And, for those bargain shoppers, each day they have a  different special 'Zone for $5.00.

Don't forget to end with the AppleZone for desert. 

Go see Mike, tell him I sent you!"}
{"text":"*Love the crew here
Super chill place with awesome music
Every time, DP makes it right*

Look this place is great. The food is everything you could want from a quick calzone place. The Zones are huge enough for two. The menu design is tight and the cookies and ice cream are killer. Where to start? Try their rotating $5 Calzones of the Day."}
{"text":"My very pregnant, vegan self is in heaven right now. I got the vegan cheese bread and it was absolutely amazing. My Omni husband couldn't even tell. I also did a build your own calzone and I couldn't be more stuffed. 

Hubs had the Parmesan wings and his own meaty calzone and we were both questioning why there wasn't a line out the door. 

The customer service was also extremely friendly. They mentioned they'll be adding some meatless/vegan items to the menu in the coming weeks. 

They also have Ben n Jerry's pints; regular and dairy free! 

This place has something for everyone and is delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I never had a calzone before so I was actually a bit nervous on what to expect.  After biting into a hot D.P Dough Calzone, I was hooked.  The calzones are great, and the dipping sauces are even better.  

It's not too expensive, costing around $6-7 for a HUGE calzone that can easily be split up into two meals.  The calzones are packed with fresh ingredients, and you can even make your own calzone including up to 5 ingredients of your choice (more at an extra cost).  

Most people pass over it too, and while it doesn't look impressive, I definitely recommend paying the extra 60 cents for the garlic parmesean dough.  It adds a ton of flavor.  Much better than the original dough used for the calzones.    

Even more surprising, the cookies are absolutely amazing, and HUGE.  I would prefer these over the renowned Insomniac Cookies anyday.  They only cost about $1.50 each, but seriously, the cookie is huge.  Something like a 6-7 inch cookie.  Some days even bigger.  For only a $1.50, it's like 3 to 4 times the size of an insomniac cookie and tastes just as good in my opinion.  They even have a special where you can get two free cookies with two calzones.  Don't skip on the cookies!

My only complaint is that one of the workers (who seems to be there all the time) is just always disgruntled and has been rude to customers.  Cheer him up, and there's really nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Calling themselves the \"pizza alternative\" DP Dough does calzones.  (They're a franchise.) Their menu lists a bunch of quirky names and has plenty of ideas for fancy things you can put in your calzone. (eggs? eh?)  I don't know if it's the freshly made crust or the large wads of cheese but for $6.50 these calzones do take care of the hungry without off messing up your beer budget."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery late one night after returning home from the bars.

We built our zones online and they were delivered surprisingly in less than 45 minutes, which was good.

My girlfriend got a chicken, bacon and cheese zone while I built a steak, spinach and potato zone. Both were surprisingly tasty. My zone cost nearly $9, I knew steak was an upcharge but it seemed oddly expensive and the website did not have an itemized list of the upcharges for various ingredients. Both the zones were pretty good and were a big enough portion to save a little for the next day. D.P. Dough is very good drunk food.

My big qualm was with the delivery itself. I received a call from the delivery driver stating that he was outside my building. I ran all the way downstairs and met the guy practically in the street. My building does not require a keycode or buzzer to get in. I'm really not sure why he didn't come up. I thought that when I paid the delivery fee and tipped the guy, I was paying for delivery to my door, not the street in front of my building."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. I've ordered a different item every time and it's all been good. Fast delivery without ridiculous delivery charges. The apple pie zone is great!"}
{"text":"The Calzone is awesome! Sausage & Pepperoni, Pulled Pork and Meat Ball where all bad ass. Service is on point too."}
{"text":"Previously this would have been a 4-5 star review but the last two times that I have ordered during the lunch hour  my calzones have been burnt and the fries have been over done (nice word for burnt). I used to love ordering from DP Dough because the food was awesome. Once they get a new cook then I may re-evaluate their resturant but unfortunately right now they are no longer one of my favorite resturants."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always excellent service. Food is always piping hot and done correctly. Crowd pleaser for sure. Love when food is fresh and tasty. You might have to wait a while for something to be made-to-order, but it's worth the wait. Chalk wall is cute and fun. Great college spot."}
{"text":"Food is extremely bland and mediocre. Ordered for pickup. Food was supposedly \"not ready yet\" which is fine cause one would assume it would be hot and fresh. NOT. Food was soggy and cold even after being wrapped in foil. The the order was messed up even though I submitted it online so not sure how that could have gotten miscommunicated. I would never patronize this place again, I suggest you don't either. Literally have had better, fresher food at McDonald's."}
{"text":"First off, amazing food. Seriously, I drive 30 min away to get a fresh, tasty calzone. Second, their customer service is great with very friendly employees. The shop has a great appearance to it, with a very casual ambience. Would definitely recommend to a friend, and will absolutely come again! Fair warning, calzones can sometimes take a while, but way worth the wait."}
{"text":"My friend recommended for me to try this place. She's been to other locations around the country and suggested I try the one here. I purchased a groupon and visited with a friend. 

We tried the combat zone, speed zone and apple pie zone. Each were tasty and had a good amount of filling. 

The workers were friendly and it is open super late with delivery. 

We will be back again to try others. Or maybe just to get the same. It's hard to go away from things you like."}
{"text":"Extremely wide selection of calzones! The combat and Italian zones are tasty. Super friendly staff! Will definitely be back to try all the flavors"}
{"text":"First time and last time I'll ever eat here! I ordered a salad with grilled chicken (yes I know I'm at a calzone place) but I've literally never seen such a disgusting excuse for \"chicken\" from any restaurant, fast food chain, or even a frozen bag of strips in my entire life!!  I also ordered a \"burg zone\" to-go which I ate a little off to try soon as it came out and it was just ok. For a \"calzone restaurant\" they don't do a very good job either, if you want a piece of pizza with sparse toppings folded over with little cheese that's what you're going to get. Only good thing I guess is the workers were nice."}
{"text":"Good food. 

Awful service stick to delivery if you have to actually deal with anyone in the store it will certainly detract from your experience! They were very rude and made me feel guilty for asking them for service!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for calzone, cheese and bacon tater tots and some chocolate chip cookies. When I got home I had a message that part of my order wasn't given to me so I went back and they threw in some extra cookies. Everything was really good and both the gentlemen I dealt with were very nice and apologetic for the mixup. They also gave us several free cookies to make up for it. Definitely a good place to check out if you want some calzones and fresh cookies. The fact that they're open late is even better."}
{"text":"I used to order from here about once a week.  One day they told me they don't deliver where I live, and were really busy and didn't know what to tell me.  I didn't plan on calling back until they put coupons on my door advertising delivering there.  When I called and ordered they told me it would take longer to deliver since I wasn't in their delivery area.  How does that make sense?  It is good, just hope you are in the delivery area, or its a good time for them to bring you what you order.  Heaven forbid a delivery place delivers when they are busy."}
{"text":"After debating for hours about where to eat, we decided to get delivery from dp dough....  aaaaaamazing food! Awesome pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone and a 2 liter and it came 10 mins early. I got a $10 calzone that was the size of pizza hut's pizzone that didn't even have everything I ordered on it. The calzone was lukewarm as was the soda.Then to top it off the marinara they included was a small to go cup filled half way, good for maybe 2-3 dips before it was empty. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"First visit yielded a great experience. Staff was super friendly and just the fact that there is a local spot where you can get a tasty hot calzone late is always nice. I'll have to try it at least once more to give a full review but so far so good. Calzone hit the spot and the choices are varied enough to visit a handful of times and not get the same thing. Definitely on my short list of late night stops for those cravings."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times.  The food is decent but a little inconsistent in terms of how much you get inside the calzone.  The cookies are good.  The place in front of and behind the counter seems clean.

They seem to have issues having enough staff on hand but these issues seem to be common with newer places in general as they don't really know how busy they will be."}
{"text":"It's just ok. They don't deliver past mc Clintock which kind of sucks because I live 3 seconds past that. Anyways, I had the chicken bacon ranch tomato calzone. It was kind of soggy. The marinara and crust was good. I just wasn't a fan of what was inside. It's relatively cheap, 7$ for a huge calzone. Me and my boyfriend split it and still didn't finish the whole thing. I would try this again but maybe a different calzone."}
{"text":"Although I have been ordering DP Dough for over 7 years, they have really turned me off recently. Their calzones are delicious, but their customer service has been dismal the handful of times I ordered from them this summer (2014). They have been rude, or noticeably annoyed/bothered when I placed an order for delivery over the phone and chose to pay with a credit card. Their drivers delivered to the wrong address multiple times, even after I clarified where I was following the first few mistakes. One driver barely said a word to me after I greeted him with friendly words, and ended up handing me a fairly burnt Ranch Buffer. The food is spectacular, I have never had a calzone from any other business even come within range of competing, but you will have to deal with pissed off, overworked college students to experience it."}
{"text":"DP is good cheap fast food. We order from my work all the time and the guys always get there before you expect them. Our large orders are always correct and the people are friendly. What more can you ask for.  I recently put in a delivery order for my home, they delivered it without any problem even though I am out of their delivery range. I was impressed and happy."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff! The calzones were pretty tasty too..I ended up getting the ranch buffer which had a really nice Franks hot sauce kick to it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cheesy tots and the Danger Zone.
Let's start with the calzone.  Soggy.  Chewy.  and not hamburger, but meatballs.  The cheddar was not melted-not even a little bit, and the hot sauce was pooled all in one spot.
Would I order it again? 
NO.
The Cheesy Tots.  Here's a shocker, Tots are supposed to be crispy.
INstead, they were soggy, crumbling, and gross.
To add to the yuck, the tots were SUPER salty, and there was no ketchup.
MUCH too expensive for what you get.  Yucky food should be cheap.
Will I order again from them?

Super unlikely.  In fact, NO."}
{"text":"Awesome calzones!  We tried the Sun Devil Zone and BBQ chicken Zone.  They were both packed with meat and cheese, also came with a side of marinara, and ranch for dipping.  The crust was cripsy.  

One zone was just enough and very filling.  You can't go wrong for a meal under $8!

Also they make their own cookies, baked fresh right out the oven when you order.  It was good.

We'll be back, next time we are in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Restaurant update:
This continues to be a great fast food place for on-call cravings. It is great comfort food because it is essentially a pizza wrapped up into a yummy pocket. I have eaten here so much over the past 2 years that I have earned even free calzones from ordering online and earning points. Usually if you order online there is no issues with getting your order as you walk in. There is always ample cheese and other ingredients in the calazone and for the people complaining that it is dry, I have not had that experience after eating 15 calzones over the past year. There is so many to choose from!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the 1st time today and was impressed. Ordered thru uber eats and it came fast and hot. The dough wasn't crispy but my spinach, ricotta garlic calzone was great. I ordered mozzarella sticks thinking they were breaded cheese sticks and it was actually cheese bread but delicious nonetheless and came with garlic butter sauce and your  choice of dipping sauce. It was cheap, fast and pretty darn good. I'll definitely order from DP again."}
{"text":"I live right by the location, so I visit maybe a little too often. The prices are great, the food is ALWAYS hot,  and out of about 30-40 visits I've had an issue twice  (minor issues, hence the 4 stars). All in all a great place for a cheat meal."}
{"text":"thank you for 2 hour long delivery. Great job running a business. A+ 
will starve again."}
{"text":"Some great drunk food! Got the buffalo zone and it was delicious or so I thought? We did order really late and it kind of took forever and what made me mad was that some of our friends ordered after us and got it before us!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with my first visit to DP Dough! The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was spotless. I ordered two calzones (one to eat, one to take home). Two calzones, cheesy tots and a drink was a quite reasonable $18. I ordered the Cheeseburg Zone for there, the Drop Zone for home. The Cheeseburg Zone was served with marinara and had an excellent ratio of dough to filling, a key element for calzones. The cheesy tots stayed fairly crisp throughout the meal and were an excellent side. The staff checked on me during the meal and offered me additional sauce options. Overall, I highly recommend DP Dough for daytime or late nite dining!"}
{"text":"Mike and Kyle are favorite people at DP Dough. 
My favorite meal is the Mac and Pork. OMG get ready to have your taste buds blown.
Someone said the cookies were life changing! I would closely agree. 
PS. Does DP stand for Damn Perfect? I wouldn't doubt it. 
Thanks DP Dough. I'll see you all soon again."}
{"text":"The most disappointing delivery experience I've ever had since being delivered at Alexian Brothers hospital. My standards for food past 2:00am are rock bottom, but DP Dough must be ADVANCED rock bottom."}
