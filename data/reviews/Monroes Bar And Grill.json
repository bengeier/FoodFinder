{"text":"Was excited that a new restaurant came to town. Salad was old and wilted. Lettuce had dirt on it. Six items to choose from on menu. Pretty sad because they just opened this past Friday. The filet was juicy but with little flavor. Service is something to be desired. We were here on Wednesday evening around 5:30. The place was empty. Servers were hard to find. Hopefully they can turn it around. I won't be back. Spare yourself the trouble!"}
{"text":"Waited for almost 30 mins before I even saw a waiter. They said they were way too busy as the entire place had more empty tables than tables with people. The waitress was rude. The table next to us walked out so we decided also to walk out. They really need to learn how to run a restaurant"}
{"text":"Giving it a 3 as they have only been open 3 weeks.  Had it been a year it would have been a 1 star for service, 3 for food and 5 for the actual place.  The joint is done right, killer patio with awesome fireplace and great ambiance with a cool little 3 piece band that was just the right volume.  We walked in and thought we had found our new place.  Then we sat by the fire and waited for literally 35 mins before we got our drinks.   I tried to get drinks from the bar but there was no bartender, the hostess turned into the bartender finally. In my business when I make a mistake I go overboard to fix it. Our drinks should've been comped instantly.    The biggest problem here is the service, it was painful.  I wanted to tell the owner \"look man, I'm guessing you have a a lot of dough invested in this place, these servers who are the face of your business are flushing it down the drain.....\"  Like I said, a killer joint with great potential but needs some tweaks ASAP on one of the most important parts.  Get someone in there who knows how to manage and you might have something.  Not once did a manager come by and say how was your dinner or we're sorry for the wait etc.  Best of luck seriously.  We will come back, worth another chance for sure.   Go try it, they have something here just needs some polishing."}
{"text":"Awful!  It's like eating in a retirement home.  There is nothing hip, trendy or inviting!  The lobster/shrimp/crab bisque was cold and had ZERO lobster/shrimp/crab actually in it.  The chicken was still completely raw inside.  The lasagna was cold.  This was after waiting 45 minutes for our food. The owner was kind, tried to fix it, but it was just too far gone!  The whole mess made us 30 minutes late for a commitment, the service was very, very slow! 4 other restaurants have failed in this spot, I don't understand why people keep setting themselves up for failure!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner. still at table. wanted get this out ASAP. Don't go here. When ordering dinner for 6 people. We knew something was wrong when Saturday night and empty place 3 of us oredered filet Mignon and 4 the person ordered filet mignon an they were you of steak . He said he would go get one at the nearest Bashas. After eating we all agreed they weren't even filets not edible. Not happy customers. Very  over priced. Lot more wrong just don't go."}
{"text":"Lack of premium liquor choices. While we did not done there, at least the place looks upscale. Will return for taste test \"after\" I've learned the bar has updated."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner.  We had the calamari appetizer for the price of $18-.  We were expecting something really good for that price. It was just the typical fried calamari with what tasted like plain old ketchup as the dipping sauce.  We had to wait an hour for our main course. The main course was just ok. The waitress tried really hard to make up for it taking so long and is the only reason I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Wow, the PRIME RIB was melt in my mouth.  Generous portion and service was Top Notch~thanks to our server, Molly!  Can't wait to dine on the patio and enjoy the lovely view of our World Famous Fountain!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for the Sunday football play offs. We enjoyed the TVs on the patio, great hamburgers and cool beer! We will go back."}
{"text":"Had waited a few months to come to this new restaurant. The Friday special was a great deal. Glass of  wine Included! Food was very good, service was excellent.  Will be back.  Fingers crossed that this restaurant will make it here at this location.  There was entertainment tonight as well."}
{"text":"We went there last night 1/29/16 five of us, my parents ordered steaks and they were both greasily and tough and baked potatoes were also bad as if they were a day old or over baked. My Mother mentioned her disappointment to the server but nothing was done! My chicken had the asparagus inside my chicken instead of a side! Really?!?!  Service was slow, the music was very good but we won't be back, also when you walk into the restaurant the hanging light is filled with cobwebs, the mirrors inside were dirty, half of the lights were out, terrible-terrible place, don't waste your time or money!!!! :("}
{"text":"Met some friends for Brunch. Did their brunch buffet (didn't even notice if they have a menu). I saw eggs, hashbrowns, ham, vegetation lasagna, fruit, sausage/egg/cheese biscuits, blueberry bread, other bread-type things, mini muffins, pancakes, Swedish meatballs (I think), Cinnamon rolls, crab legs, bacon, sausage, and .... We'll just say other stuff that I don't remember. I choose pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, blueberry bread, cinnamon roll, strawberries, grapes.... And I think that's it (2 total trios to the buffet) The food was not warmed at a high enough temperature. Nothing was heated when I got to the point of eating it (I don't know anything about proper serving temps, but it should be high enough that when I sit down to eat it it's still warm). Pancakes - were the perfect size, Hungry Jack syrup container available beside them - they weren't very good. They were cold and just not good. A little dry and flavorless. The eggs were good - but cold. Hashbrowns - they weren't homemade, they were fine... but room temperature Fruit - the grapes and strawberries were good. My fear was that they'd taste like Mellon, because they were served with the Mellons. They didn't. So good taste and correct temperature. Cinnamon roll and blueberry bread - both good.   Their buffet price point was fine, at $12. It includes tea and coffee, I believe. My biggest complaint is the temperature if the food.   Mimosas were only $3, not a bad price because there was actually booze in it. Draft beer - tried 2 different ones, I believe they were $4 each. Neither if them was cold enough, they were cold just not that crisp cold that they should have been (using the Google, I see that it's just over freezing, 36 to 38 is prime for draught beer). Shocktop draft seemed a little bitter..... That may not have been because I didn't get an orange slice with it or maybe the beer set too long.   The folks were nice. We stayed so long that they even all stood up to say good bye to us as we left. Just so you don't make the same mistake we did, they don't stay open after the end of the buffet... They are open on Sunday for the buffet only. They had the game on, the waiter kept showing up.... We didn't know they were closed. :/  whoops. That was nice of them, though.  All in all, the buffet would have been good if the food was heated better. I'd like to give Monroe's another try. Next time order from their menu."}
{"text":"The food was poor, at best.  Keep the Schmoozing manager (?) and get RID of the chef.  Nothing tasted good, high prices and the only thing that saved the night was the nice patio, view of the lake and a good bottle of wine with good friends. Sooo disappointing!  Won't be back...Fountain Hills has better and deserves better."}
{"text":"Everyone here was rude. Waited for 30 min and couldn't even get water. Asked the waitress 3 times and she just ignored us and said how busy she was. If she stopped telling everyone how busy she was and just did it, maybe everyone wouldn't be waiting. Saw numerous people get up and leave. Everywhere else was busy and everyone was happy. This place was empty due to horrible service, rude waiters and waitresses and terrible management."}
