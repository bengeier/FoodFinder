{"text":"I love this place. Warm, cozy, perfect spot to catch up with some friends or relax and enjoy a cup of chai latte."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's nice for Scarborough, because all you see are Tim Hortons....and Tim Hortons are not nice places to relax and take a date to or hang out with a group of friends. They have comfy chairs and lots of yummy drinks. I usually get the chai latte and a panini sandwich. The soups are also okay. They have a selection of pastries that are ok. It's for sure a nice change in the area!"}
{"text":"I rem being really excited to see this place opening up but sadly abit disapointed now that it has. The coffee is good, nice and strong, you can get it fair trade, organic or just the regular stuff, and the price difference isin't to different. I really like their soups, and chille, aswell.  

It is nicer then the regular Timmys we normally go to, but thats just if you ignore the bitchy lady at the counter......she is what kills it for me. Everything about the place is nice but her!. I had complained about a burnt coffee I once had and the attitude I got from her was enough to keep me comming back for a couple months. I still dont like the one lady but if you can deal with a little bitchyness in return of not going to Timmys check it out. Its very comfy and the fireplace makes it a little bit more special. ( little bit.........shes still grumpy)"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Had the turkey, bacon wrap and it was delicious. We also had the desserts there, too.  And they were all soo tasty.  It's a good place to go when your sick of typical fast food."}
{"text":"My visit was actually last fall. Food & service was great but my favorite was the live music!! It was the first time I ventured in because to be honest, it didn't used to look like it had very nice clientele. Now the outside looks nicer, & more welcoming. I was very pleasantly surprised inside by how roomy it was. (Much bigger then it looks from the outside.) They should definitely promote the live music, it was why I chose there instead of Starbucks & so glad I did!! Desserts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Good place for hanging out with friends, has a very comforting feel. I ordered a latte; it wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible- very meh. They have a lot of options for food: cakes, muffins, cookies etc. Only if their lattes were as great as the food selection."}
{"text":"Although a franchise, I think Coffee Culture is a really cute and humble little coffee shop. The seating is really comfortable and cosy, staff are cool and non-intrusive and they even bring your food to you at your table! :\") 

The pricing is really not bad here compared to other bakeries and patisseries around here. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato ($5.99) and I usually get the tea which is ~$2.00. The sandwich was the perfect lunch portion and seriously yummy!! The mango slushie which is around $3.50 I think is very mango-ey and delicious as well :') They have interesting 'Signature' flavours of muffins such as Pistachio, Maple Pecan Crunch and Double Chocolate for a good price, around two dollars I think. 

Because of the cosiness, free wi-fi, and yummy food, Coffee Culture is my favourite hide-out in the area"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is not bad like other reviewers described. The place is actually nice when you compare it to other coffee shops in Scarborough. 

But I am never coming back here again. 

The lady at the counter is R-U-D-E and ripped me off. I ordered medium iced coffee and she asked me if I wanted sugar and I said yes. But she gave me small iced coffee and charged me for vanilla syrup... when I corrected her, she made it sound like it was my fault. Anyways, this other girl changed it to the medium sized iced coffee but all she did was add more milk.... really? Seriously disappointed at this place for doing this.

When I tasted my \"medium\" iced coffee, I realized that they did not add vanilla syrup.. I drink coffee everyday, sometimes 2-3 times a day and trust me, I KNOW what vanilla syrup tastes like in my coffee. What they added was sugar. The coffee was also not fresh. I saw the girl going into the back to make my drink... I'm going to assume that the they refrigerate their coffee...don't know how long they keep it there.  

I walked out thinking how I would rather go somewhere else and pay more to get a proper coffee.

Thanks Coffee Culture on Ellesmere, for wasting my time and money."}
{"text":"I love the Coffee Culture on Eglinton and so I thought I would have the same amazing coffee here. 

Boy was I wrong. My server was a grump, giving attitude to a little old lady sitting at the counter who asked questions regarding upcoming events across the street. The boyfriend's black coffee was weak and my cappuccino ended up being a cupful of weird taupey coloured lukewarm milk. Barely any espresso present. Blegh. 

Other than the nice, big space and location, there is no reason to come here."}
{"text":"The people here are friendly. I placed my order and they told me to have a seat. They brought me my order and came to check up on me after awhile. I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing customer service. 

The food is really good and the coffee is strong, fair trade and organic. Well worth the price if you ask me. This has now become a regular spot for me and a group of my friends."}
{"text":"Regular at this place.

Good food choices, amazing drink choices; cold or warm their coffee drinks are amazing.

Customer service is also good. The place does get noisy though and seating becomes limited because people do decide to camp there thanks to free wifi."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and love this chain. This particular location has great staff who are very friendly. The only problem is that some of the staff are ssssllllooowww. I'm typically not in any hurry so I'm not particularly affected by the speed but I know that when people are just running in to grab a coffee (i.e before or duing work) then this could  cause a bit of an issue. Their club sandwich is fantastic and their latte's are excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one quick.

I strolled in there with my sister to grab a quick coffee and treat. I ordered a small medium roast coffee, and she asked me how I like it. I didn't realize they do your coffee for you like Timmies. I also ordered the chocolate peanut butter muffin. 

The muffin is closer to a cake, it was really decadent. It was okay, but I could not finish it. The coffee was like 4/10. You can't call yourself a coffee shop if you can't deliver good coffee, sorry. My order was also wrong,  she gave me a medium coffee and charged me for it . I didn't realize it was wrong until I was leaving.

It was clean, but the service was slow. 

Also while we were there two employees got into a spat and were arguing loud enough to be noticed."}
{"text":"Nice interiors - every booth had an outlet to charge your electronics. Attentive staff - They come to you with your drinks if you dine in, not needing to wait for your drink before you grab a seat. Very welcoming and makes you feel very open to tell them how they can improve once you talk to them. 

They got a deal right now for $2.85 for a med. coffee with fritter which isn't bad for a snack in the afternoon."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I would have given this 4 or 5 stars, the food is good and the first time I came everyone was friendly and everything worked. I have been back 2 more times since and this time it is my last. If you are looking for a coffee shop to support that is not a Starbucks or Tim Hortons while getting some school work or actual work done, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. 

One of the co-owners here (the female one) has no concept of customer service if you happen to sit in a seat she this is too much space for just you or you and a friend.... Even if the place is not busy. Last time I was here she had an issue with where my friend and I were sitting and even though we spoke about it and worked it out. I literally saw her do it to someone else today. It's horrible. I have even heard 3 separate employees complaining about here. 

Now for the most important thing; if you're trying to do some work. The outlets have not worked 2 out of the 3 times I've been here and the Internet is not working currently which I found out after order $20 worth of food and cake which in all honesty if I knew the Internet wasn't working I wouldn't have ordered. Even after telling them the Internet is t working, none of us in here have been given an update as to whether or not they have even tried to get it up and running. I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill ever since management and staff has been changed around a year ago. Used to be a go-to spot for getting work done in a coffee shop that has comfortable seating, outlets, and decent food (rarity). I used to frequent this place many times a month. 

Their service has gotten much worse. Staff is rude and has been demanding that every person buys an item up front when before that wasn't a problem at all. Sometimes we'd just buy a drink to share other times 3-4 items. Definitely not being cheap here. Last visit was the last straw - we were kicked out rudely for not buying more than one item.

Their food has gotten worse as well in quality and quantity and to top it off, it's more expensive. Baked goods and cake are good and I'll give them that. For the same price or less though you can get a filling meal from Hakka Legend or Burrito Zone in the same plaza and won't get haggled for purchasing more items(Lower quality)than you actually want to consume. 

Not coming back to this place unless there is a change in management and menu.

I've never written a review before this. This experience warranted one."}
{"text":"this place was very cute, very clean but horrible rude service. my coffee was very bitter so i asked to fix it and got attitude back as if i was asking for something that was a big deal. food was not fresh and the employees were very rude. would not come again."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the end of a date to relax have a coffee (or iced frap) and talk after dinner. It's like Starbucks but cozy and more homely ."}
{"text":"Anyone notice, the prices vary depending on the person at cash, the same sandwich combo can vary from $11 to $14.....
That's something management should look into..."}
{"text":"This place has pretty bad customer service and the owners are pretty cheap. You can tell that they nickel and dimed customers and are not very customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Great place to study, a waitress didn't seem very knowledgable (she might be new) but the staff in general very accommodating."}
{"text":"Pros: late hours,  fire place, chatty staff, location. Would give 3.5 stars if that were an option. No complaints about what I've tried,  but nothing has been spectacular. I'm not a big coffee drinker,  but I have enjoyed the Morocco mint tea and a few of the different cakes. Go for the peanut butter chocolate or the carrot cheese cake if you like your desserts rich!"}
{"text":"Wow....All I can say is wow... I was literally appalled to the point of speechlessness by the absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service (please excuse the capitalization but I've never experienced anything quite like this at any of the restaurants/coffee shops I've been to in Toronto).

Here is a (close) transcription of what happened:

My friend and I went into the coffee shop, intending to eat and study. All seats near power outlets had been occupied, so we sat at a table that's an aisle away from the power outlet. Without thinking too much, my friend tried plugging her computer into the power outlet, with cords across the aisle (a tripping hazard, no doubt it's our fault), and left for the counter. We also had a cup of coffee from another store on the table.

Then a lady came to our table, and asked us to remove the power cord of the computer (which is perfectly righteous) and \"outside drinks are not allowed, so throw it out\", while frowning the entire time. I was a little bit surprised given her attitude, but as it was our fault, I agreed. As it was not my computer, I did not move immediately to unplug the cord, but instead intended to wait for my friend and let her unplug it. The lady simply stood beside me and asked me to unplug & throw out my drink again, 30 seconds after she asked us for the first time, and her attitude was even ruder.

My friend returned and learnt about the situation, she was put off by the lady's attitude and complained that the lady could have smiled and said it nicely, instead of frowning and appearing very displeased (isn't smiling and being nice the professional aspect of serving? At least this is how I treat my customers). The lady replied by saying that if we are not happy, we can leave the shop immediately, but we need to \"throw out the outside coffee NOW\". We were speechless... This is something that I've never heard from anyone anywhere (including libraries and government agencies, where I typically need something from them, not the other way around). 

On our way out, still shocked by the experience, we asked the lady for her name, and she said curtly \"I don't have to provide you with any information\". To be honest for a moment I was confused... Was I really at customer at a coffee shop?

.....

Before this day I'd really liked this place, the environment and food/drinks are nice and they have power outlet and wifi. The service I received before had been good (although that was a year ago).

Lastly, I really hope the manager could maybe do something about the shockingly bad service??"}
{"text":"Given the lack of a decent coffee shop in Scarborough, there is not much in terms of  competition for Coffee Culture, which definitely factors into my review. That being said, the atmosphere is quite nice. Free WiFi, lots of comfy seating, some nice quiet jazz in the background, and there are even plugs if you can get a booth. Their hours are convenient as well, since they are open quite late.

The coffee was fine, comparable to your average cup of Tim Horton's coffee (i.e. perfectly forgettable). The Chicken Caesar wrap was pretty good, but again, nothing to write home about.

So far, so good; except their customer service is terrible. I had to wait almost ten minutes for someone to come out from the back before my order was taken. I had to repeat my order three times before they got it right (all I wanted was a cup of coffee, it really shouldn't be that difficult). When I went to the counter for the WiFi password, the server completely ignored me for five minutes while finishing the sandwich he was making before shoving a piece of paper at me with the password. The second server I got later on in the night was much nicer, but the damage had been done.

All in all, if you don't mind the fact that the service is hit and miss, this can be a pretty good study or meet-up spot in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Wrong order! Even though it was a simple order of sandwich soup and drink. No apologies. VERY RUDE staff. I went a few times and each time I experienced very rude staff! Be warned"}
{"text":"Coffee is decent, fresh baked goods fill the atmosphere with delicious scents every few hours and that's the real plus. Comfy environment, though it is pretty loud if you need silence or a light murmur to get focused. Attitude was unappreciated however. Because of the loud noise my gf sat on my lap on the couch to talk to me and the server told us that we were not permitted to do so. That was very irksome"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Poor service/not friendly/doesn't want to be there type of employees. Coffee was soooooo bad that I figured; it can't actually all be like this, so I mentioned it and ask for a cup from a different pot. I was giving them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps it was just the pot of coffee. The next cup was just as terrible. The employee thought I was trying to pull a fast one or something because she was very reluctant to take my full cup of coffee back and give me a different one. I feel like it was just from the same pot, but who knows. Everything bagel was good. For the price... Go across the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house and it usually ends up to be the place where me and my friends would meet up to finish our papers and etc.  yeah the lady that works there is a BITCH!! i mean I could handle her attitude most of the time but the last time I was there was it.  Me and a couple of friends were meeting up to finish a presentation we had to do for school and I had my kids with me... we were there about 10 mins settling in and one of my daughters wanted an ice cream so i went up to the counter to order her ice cream and my usual coffee and so did my other 2 friends and this LADY as we were about to order said \"You guys have been here for 10 mins and you are taking space .... are you guys going to buy anything?\" i was well angry like no lady were here to look at your ugly face !! so I tried not to yell and pull all her hair out and asked nicely if I could get a scoop of ice cream and she says \" one scoop of ice cream for such a big group?\" lady didnt even let me finish what I saying.  well anyways long story short THIS COFFEE CULTURES IS HORRIBLE!!! worst ever customer service and they should really fire this old hag!!!"}
{"text":"A nice place to go for coffee and dessert and catch up with friends. There's a nice relaxed atmosphere and if you want to run into Brampton Batman this is definitely where you want to be in the evenings ;)
The only complaints that I would have is that we quite often end up moving tables because the one we sit at is sticky and just gross.. and a couple people on staff there are really awkward to interact with.."}
{"text":"I have one main reason for giving this place 4 stars. It has serveral booths and outlets all over making it an amazing cafe to work and study in! 

Their coffee is very good, their lattes are OK but that is not its forte in my opinion. 

Their salads, bagels and pastries are all made in house (unlike second cup/starbucks). Their chocolate croissants is my particular favorite. They often have unique muffin flavors (red velvet, pistachio, season/holiday specific).

They are quite clean, counter tops and washrooms alike. They have wifi, nice background music (jazz etc).

They lose one star for customer service. They have one or two very timid regular employees who come off as rude to many people. I've been coming for a while and they have gotten used to me so they are much friendlier now. 

Otherwise, great study and work dpace in scarborough!"}
{"text":"Very nice place! Good food and nice ambience, and awesome people:)) they had very healthy food, salad and good cafe, and the most best part is their business time, almost all day, would be so great for staying in such a cozy place:)"}
{"text":"I love the service here! Food always tastes good. Fav thing to drink is oreo ccino and for food is the turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"NEVER eat here in the morning. I routinely visit my boyfriend who's mother works in Brampton, and to save a bit on the train from Guelph where he lives, we drive into Brampton early (as in, 7 am early) and catch it there.
  Well, it's the only non-starbucks location near the train station, and that's probably the only reason it gets any business in the morning. The waitstaff ALWAYS takes ages even in an almost-empty restaurant and often forgets part of my order, the pastries, at least in the morning, aren't fresh at all or taste AWFUL (and I usually go to Tim's. I'm no pastry snob and I can't eat the crap they have in that case. Seriously, their red velvet muffins taste like freaking SEAWEED), my boyfriend is always complaining about the espresso (I don't drink coffee, so I've just had their smoothies and cocoa) and it's way too expensive for the lousy service and mediocre food. Their LUNCH items are a fair bit better but it's still slow and borderline rude."}
{"text":"Came into Coffee Culture with a friend at 9PM on a Saturday because our usual drink spot closed shop without our knowing (?? rip funky munky), and this was in the area. 

First impressions- the interior is gorgeous. Cozy meets chic in this little cafe where cute little booths and tables sit under nice, ambient lighting. The place was about half filled with chatting families and teenagers hunched over laptops, which is a good sign for any coffee shop at 9PM on a weekend. 

We settled in and ordered a regular matcha latte ($4.79) and a vanilla latte ($4.79). After around 20 minutes of waiting and seeing that people who came in after us already received their food/drinks, the lady who took our order came by and asked if we were still waiting for anything. Our drinks then came promptly, and she even brought us a complimentary white chocolate macadamia cookie as an apology for the long wait. tHiS iS hOW YoU rUN A BUSINESS 

It wouldn't be fair to say that service was slow here since it seemed more like the case of a \"forgotten\" order, and it was nice that they were so sweet and apologetic about it. The lattes were good and the cookie was also memorable (and not just because it was free o clock). 

I would definitely come back, since it seems like a great place to get some work done or catch up with friends while sipping on something sweet. I feel compelled to say that the Funky Munky void has already been filled- It's been a roller coaster of a night.

Also, sorry for the trash picture. I forgot to take one until we were almost finished (and my friend was serving LOOKS)"}
{"text":"ATTITUDE. ATTITUDE. ATTITUDE.

Horrible service and horrible attitude. You can have the best coffee or the best food, but if your customer service is terrible, say bye bye to thousands of dollars from willing loyal customers."}
{"text":"Nice comforting atmosphere. Good place to go on a winter night for coffee and chatting ! The service wasn't that great and coffee was a little on the cooler side, but the cheese cake was delicious."}
{"text":"This here is the newest location in Mississauga, and is quite nice with various types of seatings from couches, chairs, high chairs, to booths and plus they have a patio in the summer. 

The server was very nice and friendly and they also brought our drinks to the table. I had their Hazelnut Latte and reese's peanut butter slice of cake. The coffee was good and the cake was very good. The coffee at this place isn't bad, so its good to check it out. 

For the internet lovers, they have Wifi."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Keele & Rutherford, so it's a convenient location for me. It used to be one of my go to study places even though it does get quite busy. 

The seats are comfortable and there's a cozy atmosphere. I don't think outlets are too hard to find here, although I've only sat in the same general area every time I've been here. 

There's nothing too different in the menu compared to other coffee shops, but if you order a food item or something that takes longer to make they will bring it to your table. I had one of their cakes once and it was pretty good. A hot americano black was my go to and it did the job just right. 

Probably won't be back though, as I only have memories of studying here lol"}
{"text":"Despite the many poor reviews that have been given for this place, I have yet to have a poor experience here (at least not at the level of some reviewers). There are some downsides to this place, but not enough to make this a place not going to. The first is that there internet password changes all the time and you have to forget the network and keep putting in new passwords. It seems trivial but it does become a nuisance especially since they have had internet issues so you might have to put in more than one password in one visit. The other negative is that this place is usually packed and it's difficult to actually get a seat here. That's a pretty good problem to have though for a business. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and great for just hanging out but also to sit down and get some work done. The drinks are pretty good and I find the tea more flavourful than comparable places. Prices are reasonable too. Good food, good prices, good atmosphere and yet to have a poor customer service experience. Perhaps the management has already addressed and trained the staff accordingly to prevent these issues. I would definitely recommend this place, but would caution coming here at peak hours because of the lack of seating (not that this place is small)!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It has a very nice atmosphere.

The counter service is definitely a lot better since September 2014. I often frequent this place and it is one of my favourite places to simply hang out. Sometimes there isn't enough seating around 6pm-8pm.

For the menu, I personally enjoy having the cappuccino ice cream cone or the cheese cake here. As for the coffee... lets just say I'm not really a coffee lover."}
{"text":"This is my go to study place and its a great hangout with friends. The food can vary in prices and staff is very nice. I recommend getting their hot chocolate because its like heaven in a cup. My only concern is it getting too full one day!"}
{"text":"i totally forgot about giving Coffee Culture a review....i did their landscaping just as it was opening up.  The owner and staff are very friendly, and the menu has a good selection.  one day while we were working there i went across the street to an italian sandwich/bakery place, what a mistake......very rude and sandwiches weren't all that good (coworkers ate their too) ......the only thing i didn't like about Coffee Connection is that they didn't have French's mustard.....wtf?  we joked about that with the staff (we worked their for 4 days) .....maybe they have mustard now!  i had to go over to the italian deli and ask for mustard, she knew what i was up to and was not happy that i was taking the mustard and going back to Coffee Culture, lol, oh well maybe if they had better food we would have eaten there every day.   All in all good food and drinks, very nice staff and simply amazing landscaping!!!"}
{"text":"This place feels very cozy. I came here with a couple friends and we enjoyed our time and drinks. I had the hazelnut latte and it's definitely my fave!"}
{"text":"This place is good for finding a seat and having a nice atmosphere.

There is one middle aged women who is always working who is incrediably rude.  I have never seen worse customer service in my life.  She is cold, rude and not appreciative of the customers at all."}
{"text":"This cafe is an okay place to come if you already live in the area. Honestly that's the only reason why I come. It's usually packed with people studying or getting some sort of work done so if you plan on staying awhile and doing the same, youre gonna wanna come early in the day and secure that spot. As for the food, I'm not the biggest fan. Even the drinks are meh, and the desserts take like they're straight out of the grocery store. Service is okay, sometimes nice and sometimes not depending on the staff. Like I said, it's a good place to come and sit down and get some work done if you get a spot. If you're just coming to catch up with a friend, I would suggest a better cafe than this."}
{"text":"Environment was okay, however beware of the drinks! After having a frozen hot chocolate I spent the night extremely ill. I called in the morning to let the manager know so they could check their inventory for expired products or poorly handled milk... Instead of an apology I received attitude and the assurance that everything was fine. Really? 4 hours of being sick would indicate otherwise. Very disappointed by the service at an otherwise pleasant cafe in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Had the apple cider and it was delicious. Glad my husband and I discovered this cute café."}
{"text":"I love coming here to study. The enviroment is so nice and I'm always able to get lots done.  I love ordering the Freddichino! Great place."}
{"text":"Had a relaxing experience here with their comfy chairs and convenience. Wifi, parking, food, bathrooms, tv, less noisier than other coffee shops. Would come back here again"}
{"text":"This area definitely needed a sit down cozy coffee shop. I have been to this location few times since it had open. Good for group meetings but wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a quiet spot. This place is busy and may get loud. 

P.S raspberry cheesecake was a bit dry otherwise, everything seems to be good so far."}
{"text":"Service is a complete DISAPPOINTMENT. We ordered 2 of their combo sandwich,cheesecake and drinks and it took the staff an hour to bring our order because the staffs FORGOT about it considering that there was only few people in the restaurant that time (only 4 people and only the couple behind us was the only one waiting for order). This will be my first and last time I will ever come to this restaurant ."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for studying, just because of how close and convenient this is to where I live and because you can stay for as long as you like and won't get kicked out. Wifi is available, you just have to go to the counter and ask, and obviously have to buy something first. I've tried many of their drinks and pastries, and their prices can be compared to Starbucks. The recent time I went, i got one of their new drinks which was a matcha green tea latte, and a pumpkin muffin. The matcha tasted very rich and a little sweet, but if you're into sweet drinks like me, then it won't be a problem. Their pastries are average in my opinion, they offer muffins, cookies, scones, etc.
The only thing that bothered me was when I came up to the cash to order, there were two female workers who were cleaning and talking to one another and made eye contact several times with me, before one of them came to finally take my order. 
Overall, this is a good coffee shop to get a lot of work done and if you want to get a good seat, I would suggest coming earlier in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and polite. Recommended a fantastic organic coffee I look forward to getting again.

Lots of seating but it was a little crowded if you weren't in a booth. The tables were really close together. It has large windows with lots of natural light.

Lots of students glued to their laptops! It was nice though; able to get lots done without distractions. 

Very clean even thought it was very busy. The staff kept the tables clean and ready for the next bunch.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The worst coffee culture. Servers are very rude and slow. And give so much attitude when you ask them how long your coffee will take or where you're supposed to wait for your coffee"}
{"text":"I was downtown fashionably late like always and couldn't decide where to get quick beverage/snack with my friend. I saw a Starbucks but then right across I saw Coffee Culture and I found it cute with their mini seating outside. I ended up grabbing their Freddocino in Mocha in a regular size but if I knew it was going to be so good, I would've got a bigger size. My friend ordered a café latté and she also loved her beverage. The best part was their gourmet cake slice of caramel carrot cheesecake, it was one of the best cakes I have ever had. I wasn't too thrilled of the drizzled sauces on the plate for presentation purposes, seemed a little sloppy. They have a few more locations around the GTA, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Very warm, cozy, and a great place to study. But the service, is crap! I waited in a line that extended behind me for about 6 minutes, as there was one person behind the counter. The girl had taken my order, yet decided to make my sandwich after she took 10 other people's orders! I waited my turn, she could have made my sandwich at least after the people in the line that were behind me, but she literally kept taking orders as people came in. I waited 20 minutes before I actually got my sandwich. The girl had attitude and told me to take a seat and that it would be ready in five minutes and that she would personally bring it to me. She put my plate on the counter, took out the garbage, took more orders, and didn't even let me know. The sandwich was soaking in dressing, but was pretty decent. Was it worth $9? Not in combination with the service it wasn't."}
{"text":"will say that the ambiance is great, the coffee is not bad at all- I actually prefer it. The WiFi is fast, and some of the people that work there are friendly. The issue is really with the managers (owners?)- a middle aged gentlemen who wears glasses and the woman who I assume to be his wife. 

Last week sunday, I was there for about 4 hours or so studying. I saw the gentleman approach a young woman seated alone and took the other chair away from her that she was saving for a friend who was coming to meet her. He said that he didn't want anyone to walk in and leave because there was no where to sit. It should be noted that a large party had JUST left on the side of the cafe with the couches and the fireplaces, there was ample space for anyone who might arrive. 

A couple in the booth next to me saw this happen, and offered their booth to the young woman as they left since he can't take away the other couch from her. When her friend arrived, the manager had one of his baristas come out and tell the friend she had to purchase something right now because \"She is using their WiFi and taking up space.\" The barista seemed embarrassed and apologized for this, saying she couldn't help it and her boss had requested she relay the message. 

Previous to this experience, I had heard bad things about the service about specifically these two individuals (the owners or managers?) at this Coffee Culture. Yet, I continued to be a patron as I had not seen anything in my personal experience to support these claims. After this experience, I will not be returning there. 

I would not suggest coming here unless you're completely out of options. The customer service is awful, they come across as very cheap and it seems that students (who make up the majority of their clientele) are especially treated badly. It's really a shame, because with better management this place could be great. Do yourself a favour, avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe to get some work done. Their coffee is OKAY. I'm an addict and it did the job, I wouldn't get it on the regular. Their lattes are nice and asthetic if you need something for the gram. They have some great variety of cakes and sweets if interested. I love how theres a bunch of outlets so you're not restricted to one spot. I'll definitely keep going."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new coffee place in Markham so was there for a quick brunch with my SO but it was disappointing as the coffee was mediocre, watered down taste (Tim Hortons and Mcds coffee is way better in comparison so this says alot) food was okay and service was so-so. I guess I was hoping for the coffee to have it's own taste like alchemy coffee as the price you pay is almost the same. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"My new go-to coffee and workplace! I think their half sandwich, salad and coffee is great- at $7, it's a good snack portion. However, if you are really hungry, go for their full sized sandwiches and add $2.50 for making it to a combo. Much more affordable than ordering two $7 combos an hour after the first. I wanted to keep this gem of a coffee place to myself as it is already so busy, but I can't help but share a great experience. Must try their red velvet muffin, pistachio muffin and chocolate croissant as mentioned by other yelpers. I will try to spread that out through 3 separate visits! Definitely going backz there's really not that many coffee places that is not Tim Horton's or Starbucks uptown!"}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is decent hours and large seating area. Apart from that, I can't see why anyone would come here over Queen Gypsy or even Starbucks nearby. Coffee and Americanos are weak and the deserts are average, and the food looks so as well. Might be deserving of a 3, but could easily go to a 1 for charging $2.50 for a SINGLE SHOT OF ESSPRESSO! My bill was $8.50 for a triple shot Americano and a $2.50 coffee cake. I would've walked out, but needed to do some work and duly paid my overcharged like a complete b*tch. Will try to avoid this place on principle unless I'm stuck like the other day."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick ice coffee, and thought I would give this place a try.   

Can't speak for the desserts which look pretty tasty.

The service here is good, employees are friendly and their is a nice hussle to get things done by the staff.  The place is clean and has a nice ambiance.

My ice coffee although price was good ($2.99 for a medium) I added milk and asked to add some sweet to it.    Would have preferred if the used an agave or syrup, instead sugar was used.  When drinking my beverage you can feel the undissolved sugar grains.   I think changing this practice would go along way to make the beverage a lot more enjoyable.  The grains in the drink kind of ruined it for me

Would give the place another chance.   Next time will try the fair trade coffee."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to just lounge around with friends or a significant other. It's also an ideal place to get some work done! They have plenty of comfortable chairs and booths. My personal favourite is the chairs around the electric fireplace/tv. 
My friends and I go to this particular location 2-3 times per month to just catch up. It's great that they are open late and we usually spend numerous hours here.

You order and pay for your food/drinks at the cashier and they bring it to your table.

In terms of drinks, I've only had the hazelnut and caramel latte and i love it! I usually get the medium and it's huge! As I haven't tried the other drinks I can't comment on those. I have tried their hazelnut chocolate crunch pastry, it's pure chocolate goodness. They also have many sandwiches, soup and salad options. However, I have only tried the grilled cheese and minestrone soup, which was good. 

I do wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fair trade organic coffee is fresh and other culture's blend is acceptable
The downside is the milk and creams are not accessible with condiment area. 

The upside is that the shop is spacious and clean.  It is a great additional coffee shop in Markham. I believe coffee cultures are widely franchised in GTA and this is the very first in Markham area. We coffee lovers welcome this chain getting closer to us :)"}
{"text":"was excited to check this place out but sadly disappointed. Ordered two matcha latte with soy and it only tasted like soy. I drank more and a huge chunk of matcha powder was in my mouth...for 5 plus a drink id def rather go starbucks ):"}
{"text":"The booths are comfy and atmosphere warm but the drinks are mediocre. Their sandwiches are excellent, but the prices on their whole menu is to high for the quality. 

Advice: thus restaraunt needs to get a real barrista and espresso machine."}
{"text":"I don't know what they're serving here but it tastes like imitation coffee at best. It went straight into the garbage. Girlfriends \"latte\" was also terrible."}
{"text":"LAME. The only thing thats worth ordering here is there organic coffie and thats only if they dont screw it up. My Girlfriend got a coffie here once, it tasted burnt and all the lady behind the counter had to say was \"maybe your tastebuds are burnt!\". Serriously!?! Also stay away from there tripple chocolate muffin, it had almost no flavour and still managed to make my teeth hurt."}
{"text":"I seriously underestimated Coffee Culture. The Power Up Breakfast Bagel was the yummiest bagel..with avocado..  eggs .. cheese.. yummy! There's a work and student culture here but there's a lack of outlets and people seem to be on a constant watch for them. Please get some outlets for the island tables. They won't give you the Wi-Fi password unless you purchase something  but friendly service overall."}
{"text":"This place has always been my girlfriends and my meet up place. It's cozy, has some few good items on the menu, and close to home.

Normally I try one of their hot beverages (their hot chocolate or mocha being my favourites), but today I decided to try their breakfast menu. I had the power up breakfast bagel, which was an Asian bagel with egg, cheese, avocado, tomatoes. I thought this was a good alternative to the tims or McDonald's breakfast sandwiches.

I also had the power smoothie with Greek yogurt, strawberries and blueberries. I would also recommend this, if you're looking for a healthy alternative I the sugary hot drinks on their menu.

The only downfall of this location is its size- if you come during busy hours (lunch, afternoon or early dinner), it is almost impossible to find a seat."}
{"text":"Another coffee house that has opened up in Scarborough.  At first I was excited at the thought that Café Mirage at Kennedy & 401 is finally getting some competition, but that fantasy quickly dissolved.

I ordered a non-fat cappuccino.  The cappuccino had a watery froth, was not warm enough, and lacked coffee flavour.

The only thing that would bring me back would be the ambiance.  You can cozy up by the more comfy divans by the simulated fireplace or seek refuge at one of the many wooden chairs.  The space is bright with lots of windows."}
{"text":"5 stars for the vegetable perfecto sandwich and power-up breakfast bagel. I prefer the cafe latte and cappuccino rather than coffee. Remember to order before asking for wifi password!"}
{"text":"Wanted to feed a teenager and Mrs a good coffee so we found a CC nearby. 

Parking is a not easily available even on a weekend, but it is Brampton city centre. 

The decor is retro with hardwood floor and comfy chairs. The ordering was quick, however one of the staff wasn't as comfortable in speaking clearly or was new. A veggie wrap, a coffee and an almond pastry was ordered. 

The coffee as usual good but not as hot as we would like it. The veggie wrap filled nicely and toasted perfectly. The Almond Pastry was good. However that afternoon the selection of Desserts was quite limited. 

The visit to the bathroom was a big mistake. Mrs and me had the same complaint-was clean but did not smell clean and felt as it stinky and not enough fresh air. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Great place to study. Love the environment. The food is delicious and sold at a reasonable price. However, coconut iced coffee isn't as great as it looks. Save your summer refreshments for Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Pretty standard coffee place. Got an iced coffee with milk and shared a piece of carrot cake with a friend, both were good. The patio is quaint, but nice to sit on to enjoy a beverage and book or conversation. I would return if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Under new management! Hooray! All the past reviews are entirely understandable, as their past management and service was pretty damn bad, I was always very intimidated to even come here. But I came today for some dessert and tea after dinner with friends and it was great! Service is friendly and fast, the place is super clean and cozy with a nice fireplace seating area with a TV, and the products do not disappoint at all. 
Today I enjoyed a nice white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake and some mint tea. The cheesecake was really yummy and served nicely, very chain restaurant style on a square plate with chocolate drizzle. They also serve lunch foods such as soups and sandwiches and their dessert and snack options are not limited as well, even sporting a full ice cream bar.
Free Wi-Fi and booths with power outlets make this a go-to for many students in Vaughan.
The only downside is that it can be quite busy, since it is open late, and it may be hard finding a place to sit for 3+ people sometimes but if you're willing to wait, you might be in luck.

Definitely give this place another shot. The new management is doing a great job."}
{"text":"\"Toto.. I don't think we're in Seattle anymore...\"

That's the thing I couldn't help but think when I was in this coffee place. The decor is ok enough, though it looks like was ripped off from a Coldstones. 

Frankly, they call themselves \"Coffee Culture\" but it's clear they don't understand it. I ordered a Double Large Butter Pecan Latte\". First of all, I don't think they put in the butter pecan flavoring. Secondly, it's very clear that the roast is burnt. Third, the \"barrista\" was like \"oh, double shot, I'll put it in a large cup\". I was \"no you won't\". 

Seriously, is it that hard for the person to understand, I wanted two shots of espresso, with less milk etc? None of their Credit card machines seemed to work, and the people weren't really competent. The food didn't look appetizing, and the overall experience was very meh.

Given the choice, I would chose Tims over this place any day."}
{"text":"I had a very weird experience here.  I think I came across a very stoned barista/CSR and they were just chit chatting with friends for a few minutes.  The barista was so loud and obnoxious.  Think Rob Ford with his Jamaican accent.

After about 3 minutes, I started to walk out, but the more normal, professional gentleman noticed my frustration (and you could see he was frustrated with his co-worker too) politely asked \"how may I help you sir?\" 

So thank god the owner employs this guy with that other girl or they'd have no business.  Anyways, got a vanilla iced latte and it was very tasty. 

Overall, it's a decent coffee shop with good drinks and a tv but but they need to do some better hiring."}
{"text":"Came here 8:30 am to grab a coffee as this is the only option within the area. Upon entrance, welcomed with a warm entrance, the decor was very cozy, incredible Bossa Nova jazz playing at the perfect volume. Perfect leather couches, nice comfortable seating booths, newspaper available for free and best of all, free/fast internet.
The patrons were a mix of individuals from students working (genuinely) on laptops. The young lady working at the cash, very pleasant.

Overall, very pleased with the setting. I had a look at the menu filled with variety of panninis and sandwiches. I did not order food, so I cannot vouch on food quality despite noticing delicious food as ordered by other patrons."}
{"text":"Nice place, has cupcakes so it won over my heart. It has free wi-fi but the customer service isn't as great. Do not expect to bring any food from outside or they'll threaten to kick you out. It is a great place to meet up a friend to meet up or study for your exam, a lot of people come here to find a quiet place to study."}
{"text":"The CUTE girl sitting in the corner on her Laptop studying is going to kill me for revealing this Coffee Culture which opens until 11:00pm some days and Midnight on others.  

It's definitely a good option for the somewhat close-by UTSC(U of T Scarborough) students to study in peace at a cafe much like how Williams Coffee Pub does the same for students at U of W and McMaster.

A summer Wednesday night at 10:00pm I looked around for a cafe for a COLD drink for this humid/hot night and possibly a Dessert Cake.  This place had it's own crowd chilling as it was 75% full of people chatting, reading, wifi-ing, CP24-ing, etc...

There was a table or two on the outside too if I saw correctly.  The service was a bit awkward during my experience.  I asked for a Iced Coffee like any other Cafe I go to but here the staff SHOT back what I meant by Regular.  Do you want Cream or Milk, One Sugar or Two? ,she asked.  Maybe it was just late night fatigue setting in for her or maybe I'm just getting too sensitive?

The Cakes looked similar selection as your Demetres or Williams Coffee Pub and I wasn't feeling it.  If you were wondering I sat in front of the girl face-to-face and she even closed her laptop so I had a clear view.  Actually she was probably just annoyed by a family group of 10+ stomping into her zone and wondering if they'll settle down.

2.0  *Stars* for Service
2.5  *Stars* for Coffee
4.0  *Stars* for Facilities/Hours"}
{"text":"The drinks are mediocre but the cakes and pastries are better than timmies so it gets a three star for that and plus the place is relatively clean unlike Tim Horton's. The service is not memorable but not horrifying either. I would rather come here for coffee to have some peace and quiet"}
{"text":"Downtown Brampton is where its at!

Ok, that was a slight exaggeration. But I did have a good time here.

Came to check out the Full Monty with co-yelper Bobby. We were a bit early so headed out looking for a coffee. Coffee culture was across the street. Also happened to be the only coffee shop open at 7pm on a weekday.

It looks like a William's Coffee. Comfy booths. A small array of treats. I had a cinnamon bun...it was ok, satisfied my carb craving. Bobby ordered a cafe mocha. Turns out the cafe mocha is mostly syrup squeezed from a big tub on the counter. But the tub was stuck and our poor barista was using all her might to squeeze a little bit of syrup out. This effort did not look appetizing so we sat down to avoid the rest of the demonstration. Mocha came to the table looking fabulous with lots of whip cream :). 

Its an ok place. If I lived here, I'd try their coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"Perfect place to do some work! The place is easy to find and looks nice, rustic and vintage on the outside. You can't miss it - it's right at major mac & keele. The lot looks small, but there's more spots in the back. Unless you're dumb like me and turned into the next plaza, was overjoyed by the amount of ample parking and then realized there was nowhere to hop the fence over to the coffee culture plaza..

The place itself is pretty big for a cafe and also has a patio, which has a great street view. You order, and then you sit while they bring you your food. I had this fruity kale quinoa salad minus the cheese, and it was indeed fresh and delicious. A good portion for the price. We also had the chillers, which are great for the summertime! Mine was raspberry lemonade and I believe he had strawberry? They were both delicious, smooth without little ice chunks and amazing as it slid down your throat. (DON'T THINK THAT WAY, ACHEM.) 

The wifi refreshes every once in awhile so if nothing's loading, just give it a check. I found that it wasn't too bad though. Definitely an awesome place to do some work. I'd definitely choose this place again to work if I was in the vaughan area! Service was quick and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I am a coffee drinker and dedicated one! So I am always open to trying a new coffee shop no matter what. And this place is pretty good, it's not usually as crowded as the Timmies near by. 

They have the regular coffee both hot and cold - I am not a fan of any cold coffee because I don't get the point of it. What is nice is that they have sandwiches here, I love sandwiches. The breakfast sandwiches are not bad I like that there is fresh veggies on them. I don't always have time to have a proper full breakfast at home this coming here of a nice morning coffee and sandwich is nice."}
{"text":"Nope. Not good. Would not return.

Cashier was odd, pastry tasted very stale, coffees were so bad we left them. 

It's a shame because Coffee Culture has a nice space in downtown Brampton but the service, coffee, and food were all terrible.

Sorry to say but head across the street instead for a better overall experience.

Really a huge miss."}
{"text":"I go here once/twice a week! A really popular place for studying/dates/friends catching and even small business discussions! I highly recommend this place - really cozy and great people! The workers are really sweet and always greet me with a huge smile!"}
{"text":"I always come here to study and order a hot chocolate with a chocolate chip cookie warmed up. It's such a cute little coffee shop. My go to study spot. 

The only thing I don't like is the service, they can be rude at times and slow. 

The manager especially, she should be nicer to customers. She's told me to move out my booth because I was one person but there were a lot of other single persons taking up booths as well. On top of that it was at 4:30 which is not their peak times as specified on the table cards (11 am - 2:30 pm) and 7 pm to 9 pm. 


I'm a regular so I expected more.


UPDATE**

I stopped going here particularly after one incident with the manager. I used to come here at least 4 times a week to study (keep in mind I would buy a drink and snack every time I'd go) yet the manager straight up told my friend and I off with \"this isn't  a library\". It was insulting especially because I had become a regular - literally never going back to this place because of her. 

Went from a 5 to a 1 in less than a month. They should really should switch up management"}
{"text":"This review is based on coffee & service.

As a resident of the neighbouring homes, a lot of us were excited to see a coffee shop opening after Starbucks backed out of the site a couple of years ago. 

Walking in, you'll see that it's a very nice set up in the dining area - very cozy! 

What i didn't like was where the counter/cashier set up was. You can't tell where the line starts or finishes since there are 2 cash registers, so i wasn't sure if someone was waiting for a sandwich to the right or paying to the left. I purchased 3 coffees: 2 decaf & 1 house blend. The decaf was just \"meh\" for me. Hubby's house blend was disappointing and not robust nor did it have that roasted taste that comes with a good coffee. You know the one, where you don't have to add anything and it still tastes sooooo good! Nope, not here. Ok, so coffee was not a win. Service was disappointing too. I was asked if I wanted any cream or sugar, but wasn't told that the only place to get it was at the time of ordering. Even though they have napkins & straws along the front window, they don't leave sugar or sweeteners or chilled milk or cream for coffees. Soooo i had to wait while the 4 people behind the counter helped 2 people.

Hubby & i decided to give them another try a week ago. I walked in, there was only 1 cash being used to help customers. 4 people working and only 1 couple purchasing anything. I waited 5 minutes - nothing. I waited 10 minutes - nothing. Nobody behind the counter asked if i was ordering. The cashier busy with 2 people didn't even say \"i'll be with you in a moment, so I walked out and left with nothing.

What i got from Coffee Culture? They are trying REALLY hard to mimic Starbucks with the atmosphere, set up & menu options, but don't come even close!

I'll stick to my Nespresso at home & Starbucks when i'm out."}
{"text":"We came here Saturday night because there are not too many places in Mississauga with comfortable seating that is not crazy loud, also if you read my review of Coffee Culture on Eglington and Creditview you will know why we did not return there re. worst customer service I have ever experienced (it still infuriates me today). 
The decor is nice and we were able to get a booth, the lighting is a bit bright but people do work here so I suppose it is good for them. I got a hazelnut coffee and candy corn chai latte and a marshmallow brownie square. The brownie was okay not great, their cheesecake is a better choice. The Candy Corn chai latte was very sweet but I loved the flavour! Hazelnut latte was average, similar to starbucks. The staff took my order right away unlike the other location where they stand around and ignore you for no apparent reason. And everyone working was very friendly and brought our stuff to us at our seat. 
We did get in a bit of trouble for eating a few pretzels I had in my bag after the dessert was gone because I needed to cut the sweetness. But she was really nice about it and just explained that she could get in trouble if an inspector came in and there was outside food. 
All in all it is WAY better than their other Mississauga location but it is a chain so I can't say it is outstanding."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give this place no stars I would. The drinks are good and the vibe of the cafe is really nice for studying BUT the management is the worst I've seen. The lady that owns the place is the LEAST hospitable person/cafe owner I have ever encountered. I was kicked out of the cafe for not ordering another drink when I had been sitting there for 4 hours. This was my study spot during my school days and I would always make sure to order anywhere I visit. It's just good manners. But after being kicked out and yelled at by this lady I refused to go back...unfortunately at the time it was the only cafe that was good to study in so I ended up visiting again. 


Since my university days so many other lovely cafes and small businesses have popped up in this area that it doesn't make sense to spend my dollar somewhere I'm so put off by. Really not a good hearted establishment."}
{"text":"I always love coming here.. 
Open late, amazing coffee and lattes and the sandwiches are so tasty and different.. 
And their desserts mouth watering.."}
{"text":"Somewhat new addition to Scarborough & a supposed analogue to Cafe Mirrage. 

I ordered  cappuccino & it was OK but nothing too special.

If I do go it is for the ambiance as there is a simulated fireplace & cushy leather chairs, & nice wooden chairs if the leather chairs are taken.

Overall it was simply an alternate to the usual Tim Horton's I visit."}
{"text":"The quality of food and beverage is actually pretty outstanding. Too bad the service could be 100x better. Sometimes that awesome coffee isn't worth the time it actually takes to get my order taken."}
{"text":"Food (especially pastries and cakes) are good, lattes are okay, coffee isn't bad. Chill, relatively quiet atmosphere. Much better than dirty loud tim hortons."}
{"text":"I welcome any substitute to Starbucks with open arms. Coffee Culture is actually Starbucks: 2nd Gen., with better food, more options, outlets at every booth and a plasma screen for the bored computer-less. As strange as the location was, it's much better than the CC at College St., simply because you can actually find a decent spot. 

The service is great(I wish they had more energy, though), and if I were close-by it would be a prime location at which to do some office work. I tried the Mango Chiller and a Bran Muffin. I'd probably skip the chiller since it was too sweet and tasted mainly of concentrated mango puree, but the muffin was heavenly.

Study/Work friendly? Yes."}
{"text":"Great place to get a coffee/tea and a piece of cake and just sit back and enjoy!  The dark wood and clean lines of this place make it seem much cozier than your local Starbucks.  You can almost feel sophisticated in this joint!  The booths give it an upscale lounge type of feel and the club chairs in the back make you just want to sit and read.

If you are feeling hungry, don't worry!  They serve all day breakfast and also have some sandwiches to keep the stomach rumbles at bay.  The prices seem pretty reasonable - my organic tea was $1.90 and most of the pastries were under $3

Luckily I was there this morning so it wasn't too packed but per other reviewers it can get busy with students and their laptops.  Staff are friendly and the place is well kept.  

Parking is a little scarce but don't let that discourage you from coming here."}
{"text":"Skip the dishes fail...
Lets wait until the driver shows up and tell him we are out of items but NEVER call the customer and ask... with the number provided. Driver had to call and give them his phone so they could do their job. Just on a whole different level of wth...
Lets put small slices of cake standing up in larger foam containers and have them delivered by car... in no bag, because they won't shift around and be squished. Once more WTH...
I honestly am confused..."}
{"text":"A great alternative to Tim Horton's. Loved the atmosphere and the staff was great. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This location is underwhelming. Unfortunately, it is in a convenient area and so we frequent this place often. Customer service is not great and items are overpriced. They are very stingy with their wifi which is negative considering there are many students in the cafe. They also still have a password for their wifi which is bizarre; the internet mysteriously \"resets\" and doesn't work during busy periods. At times, they are very anal about seating as well... the customer service team have made a fuss about moving a chair or two to accommodate a party."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many people choose to do work/study here. The place is always full (a bit less so now that university exams are over) and getting by people is a hassle. It's dingy at night and the lights flicker constantly. Also, loud.

The food is alright and drinks made without much flourish, but the flickering drives me insane. 

Fix those lights!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were really good! Got a bagel with cream cheese, a breakfast sandwich for my friend, a coffee and regular latte which came out to $18. I thought it was pretty pricy for just these four things. The coffee doesn't taste great but latte was much better. Staff was nice, they brought our food to us and cleaned up our area. Nice environment to do work or catch up with friends. They have outlets on the sides of seats for certain booths. Desserts and pastries definitely looks good!!"}
{"text":"They simply don't care about customer loyalty. The atmosphere is really nice and comfortable, there's free wi-fi which is awesome and their chili and salads are delicious but their coffee is weak (even the dark roast) and one of the servers is really incompetent. 

I went there all throughout the summer and spent hundreds on food and coffee... Occasionally I would bring in my own fruits to snack on while I enjoyed a coffee (I BOUGHT) and they told me I couldn't do this. Lost a loyal customer and hundreds if dollars because of it."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here.

Brief summary explaining why:

- coffee is very weak and bland

- the portion sizes of the sandwiches are tiny and overpriced

- salad ingredients do not look that fresh

- cashier incorrectly charged me for something I did not order and refused to refund me the difference, stating that it was impossible

- wifi internet is unreliable and cuts in and out constantly


It was my second time there and needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is reallt nice. I always see lots of students studing. The food and drinks are yummy. The only thing is like any othee coffee shops..a few snacks can be a bit oricey. but they have good sandwhiches and @_@ cakes and lots of variety. Great little place in maple.  nice cozy place. Needed here in maple."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing here, it's a great place to study. I recommend the chilli here, but the waffles here were quite average. I wish the waffles were hotter, as my waffle was kind of cold and chewy."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place!
Mediocre coffee and really horrible sandwich! The most nauseating thing I've ever eaten.  It was this really fatty  prosciutto panini with greasy cheese..."}
{"text":"A few steps above Tim Hortons and more welcoming/cozy than Starbucks.
Nice interior, bright, clean, modern.
Order at the counter, find a table and your order is brought to you.
Friendly greetings when you enter, helpful, attentive staff.

White Chocolate Blueberry Cheesecake and Coffee
Asiago, Egg, Bacon Bagel
Banana Nutella Waffles

All good."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the interior and ambiance. Cozy, comfy and clean. However, the red velvet muffin is the worst thing I have ever had in my life. I told the girl at the counter while I bought a slice of cake, but she didn't seem to care. No discount given on the cake. Coffee is good and so is the mocha. Good place to work, chill and have a good cup. I'm skeptical to try the food items."}
{"text":"I gave it a chance and just as I had expected. Nothing special.
Food took forever to arrive, was brutally underwhelming. Coffee was cold. The girl behind the counter was swamped. 3 people ordered a variety of food items and she was besides herself. Seeing how frazzled she was i didn't bother asking her for fresher coffee.
Plenty of options in Woodbridge. Don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"I frequently come to Coffee Culture to study, and sometimes come by to catch up with a couple friends over coffee. Outlets can be found along the walls where the booths are, and the wifi is usually great, however you are required to buy something to use it (the password changes once or twice daily). The food is a little overpriced, however the drinks are priced about the same as a Second Cup or Starbucks. They have a decent variety of drinks - hot, iced, blended - and food items - salads, sandwiches, soups, and more. (I personally love the BLT and their chai latte.) 

The place can get a little crowded in the evenings, especially during University/college exam times and on the weekends. Sunday afternoons are particularly busy as well. If you're looking for a spot that's quiet, you can't really get that here. You'll hear the coffee grinder every couple of minutes, which can only be expected at a coffee shop, and the occasional group of people coming in for a business meeting over coffee.

The only reason why I'm giving the place 4 stars is because of the overpriced food (which I'm sure they can't control) and the overall layout of the place. When it's crowded, the line to order is all over the place, and some of the chairs are pressed up against other tables when they're occupied. But other than that, it's a good place to have a cup of tea/coffee with a book, friend(s), or laptop."}
{"text":"Service of that middle aged lady is usually very rude. Always shows an angry face and kicks CUSTOMERS out for nonsense reasons.  Only went there because its the only coffee shop in the area. But can't stand it anymore, would rather go somewhere far away."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 coffees- 2 cappuccinos and one house blend. The coffee tastes burnt in all orders and staff asked multiple times what the order was and they still forgot to put the sugar in. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's one of the very few places I can genuinely get work done. It tends to get packed around exam season since UTSC is right down the street, but if you come a bit earlier you're always able to get a seat. Great menu choices, free wifi upon purchase of something & the owners are all friendly as well :)."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Hazelnut latte large for $4.40 had great hazelnut flavour and the large was really, really large. The perfect amount of sugar was added and I didn't even have to add in any extra sugar. It was like it was perfectly made for me.

Milky Way cake for $5.25 was oh so yummy. The cake was really light and was not overly sweet and to top it off was a nice healthy layer of caramel. I would order this cake again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I like this place, a lot.

The atmosphere is cozy. Staff is helpful most of the time.

The coffee is good, lattes are delicious, red velvet muffin and chocolate croissants are yummy. They sell cakes by the slice from Rocco's bakery. They also have ice cream as well but just a hand file of flavors to choose from.

They do have 4 seater booths but 99% of the time it's taken by ONE student with his/her laptop and books sprawled out sipping on a coffee. You'll be lucky if your with a group of people and can catch a 4 seater booth."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Manager here is extremely rude and they care more about money than customer satisfaction. Highly do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Wandered into this spacious yet cozy cafe for coffee this morning. Good coffee and friendly service. They had a lot of baked goods which appeared to be commercially made. The carrot cake cheesecake and peanut butter cookies looked especially good and might be worth a repeat visit when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Food and coffee good but Starbucks service is million times better and everyone is so cheerful there. The owners wife is rude and has no patience at all. I'd rather be happy in the morning getting my coffee then seeing her cranky assssss face while placing the order.  is rather start my mornings right then wrong. Awful service ???"}

My first time at a Coffee Culture and first time going to the Markham road location.  I enjoyed the value breakfast since I needed a quick grab and go and the meal was good but lacking.  If I had to compare between Coffee Culture, McD and Tim Hortons, I would say it is a close competitor but can definitely beat out McD and Tim Hortons with a few more months of experience.  

Breakfast sandwich was filling but lacked the extra defining flavour that would make it unique.  Coffee was ok; not bland but not spectacular for a medium roast.

Would I come back? Sure.  I like to try other items on their menu especially the peppermint mocha latte and the waffles"}
{"text":"I come here regularly to do homework and it's the best! I enjoy their coffee and there yummy treats. I'm really happy they've changed owners and are under new management. When they first opened they had horrible owners that had bad manners and bad customer service.

They have wifi here which is great for study dates. Great study environment although not your usual quite libraries. 

Make sure you come earlier in the day because seats become filled and it's mostly impossible to find a chair with a plug for your computer!!"}
{"text":"I love the taste of this chain's coffee. I have mentioned this before while reviewing a different location. It stays consistent. Also, the owners always seem to be extremely pleasant! :)

The food is great and there is a lot of seating. So have a coffee and some food and hang out. It is a great place to study or do some work. 

The only downside is that sometimes it takes a while to get your stuff. Definitely not a 'fast food' environment. Which I think is a good thing."}
{"text":"I saw another review comment on the same thing 
The owners are a married South Asian couple 
The man is okay his wife ...unless your WHITE does not smile at you and ignores you ! YEs this goes for other South Asians as well ! But if your white go in she will have a smile for you  other then that  just give her your money 
Today it was practically empty ...but she has reserved seatting for special people ...practically barked at this woman to get out of the reserved seating 
Well we sat their quite awhile ....in the more then half empty place and no one came to the reserved seating she saved for he favored customers 
Other coffee  cultures are great ! This one sucks !"}
{"text":"The service was good - they brought out our coffee and our food for us!

I had the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich and the hubby got the margherita chicken grill.  I was surprised to find they used some kind of flat bread but I still can't pinpoint exactly what kind it was.

For drinks, I had a chai latte and the hubby got a regular latte.

Space is an issue, especially with individuals taking up a table for 4, parked with their laptop and their stuff strewn all over the place."}
{"text":"Nice place
But the attitude behind the counter was of the \"we dont like you\" kinda attitude.
When i brought that up with a friend since i had to question if it was me.
She said she sent me in for the coffee since she finds them the same way.
So i'm glad to know it's not me.
Coffee was good. Got it to go.
Had to ask for a cardboard thing because it was hot.
Got an evil eye and had to put them on myself.

Didn't get a reply to any of my Thank you's
Nor did i get a Thank you in return.

Other than being a pretty relaxed kinda place
If i happen to be in the neighborhood and need a place to wait or chat with someone
It certainly wont end up on any of me must go Hang out places"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for a beverage and snack. The atmosphere is very welcoming during lunchtime with lots of natural sunlight and ambient upbeat music playing in the cafe makes for a nice relaxing vibe. The staff are warm and friendly. The croissants just came out of the oven, so they were as fresh as they come. The coffee was freshly brewed. There is free WiFi here too. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Staff are nice, but the owner was extremely incompetent and unprofessional about his customers. Came in and patiently waited for a booth to sit down in. As soon as approached the booth , the owner comes out and asks me to move a bar stool because I was \"younger\"and he had \"a business to run\". Found that comment extremely rude and inconsiderate as I waited a long time for my table too. I never knew the business ran by a priority basis for their customers and not first come first serve. For a new business that just opened, I am disappointed at how I was treated and will not visit again."}
{"text":"You have to try the peanut butter cookies. They are melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this coffee place Saturday evening. there was a bleach smell when I entered  which was not pleasant. Also there was a fly in their fridge! will not go there again."}
{"text":"A nice coffee shop with friendly staff. I dropped in the evening to try out their cakes. I picked up their carrot cake cheesecake and Reese's peanut butter cup cheesecake.

Both of them wound up being too sweet by the end and I wasn't a big fan of either. 

The nice thing was they threw in a free cookie but by the time I was finished with the cake I didn't want the cookie anymore!"}
{"text":"This place is a freelancers dream in the heart of Scarborough. Booths with power, free wifi, food and of course coffee. It's clean, it's relatively quiet (smooth jazz in the background) and there are laptops a plenty.

Service was mediocre but \"fine.\" As was the coffee and yogurt parfait. A lot of what you'll find here will remind you of an airport in Chicago, but it served my needs perfectly so I'll be back again. Much less exhausting than trying to set up camp at Tim Hortons or Starbucks, that's for sure. And plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Let me tell you i spent many hours at this location and they staff were nice.   The booths were the best sets if you could get one.  Lot of popel studying....  
They have free internet just have to ask for the code.    

The prices of the food is about the same as other coffee shops."}
{"text":"I've never been a big coffee culture fan. Perhaps because there are none around me and so I never go. However, I met a friend at this location a few months ago and had a very nice experience. I rarely ordered flavored lattes since they are generally pumped full of sugar and I don't like that taste but I was craving something semi-sweet so I wanted to order the s'mores latte. The man working at the counter was very open to making adjustments to ensure the drink wasn't too sweet and he did a great job - it was amazing! 
The place itself is of course similar to all of the other locations. It had nice comfortable seats by a fireplace (very welcome since it was freezing outside), a TV with the standard CP24 playing, lots of outlets and tables for people to use and was fairly quiet (unlike Starbucks where you have to yell to be heard). While I haven't been impressed by this chain in the past, based on my experience here, I would return if I was going to have coffee in Vaughan area."}
{"text":"I like this company... the service here is not the best.
I prefer the Stoney Creek or new location on Sandlewood and Bramalea better.
However... across the street from Starbucks... this is better choice for some real properly brew java.
If you never been... a must try!"}
{"text":"Coffee and Atmosphere - good
Customer Service - poor

The lady is just annoying and disrespectful. Doesn't even give a minute to settle into the place before asking us to order. She messed up my order and got pissed at me for not speaking more clearly! Lol! Had to argue to get a measly coffee order right. First time for that. 

If they can fix that issue, it'll be a much better place..."}
{"text":"Great coffee blend -- mix it with 2 creams and a shot of vanilla ! TASTES great. Don't bother with the pistachio muffin, it tastes pretty processed and doesn't taste like pistachios at all. 

Love the feel of the place. Booths and tables for plenty of seating. Great place to just hang out and drink coffee"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on Bur Oak Ave and Markham Rd in the plaza next to Home Depot. Lots of empty parking spots in this huge lot.

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff were friendly and she even brought my order to our table even though we paid at the counter before we sat down. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Cozy, modern, and great for a coffee date/study session/catching up with friends/relaxing on your own. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
High-quality and fresh cakes. They also have fair trade coffee, so bonus points for sustainability! 

[ORDER] - 4/5
Carrot Caramel Cheesecake - $5.99: so rich and decadent! This tasted like a carrot cake and New York cheesecake had a baby, with sweet caramel sauce drizzled on top of the whole thing. A little pricey, but I still think it tasted delicious. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5 
A wonderful cafe at a good location because there aren't that many premium-quality coffee shops in the area. A tad expensive, but I'm willing to pay that price for ambiance and delectable goods."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab coffee, a bite to eat and catch up with friends.  Place wasn't too crowded when I got there and service was fast.  The price was reasonable - although my chicken Cesar salad was a bit small.  Coffee was ok, nothing special and not bad either"}
{"text":"I was REALLY looking forward to a nice coffee shop coming to this plaza. Especially since it has been over 10 years now that we've been hearing about. I was VERY disappointed when Starbucks was removed off the leasing signs a few years back. This pocket of Markham has no great places to go for coffee, sandwiches etc. Unless you're a fan of Timmies (nope!).

Very nice cozy set up inside. It was also packed! They offer breakfast sandwiches, waffles, soup, salad, sandwiches, cheesecake slices, iced coffee, coffee etc. Honestly, if not for the sign out front, you'd think you had just walked into Starbucks!

There was 5 of us, so we ordered 5 coffees and a couple of slices of their cakes. My coffee was their house blend - very bland in flavour & aroma. I am an avid coffee drinker and love me a great cup of coffee. I just wasn't feeling it at Coffee Culture.  2 of the coffees were decaf - which was the biggest disappointment. Sour almost bitter aftertaste, probably one of the worst decafs i've tried. Most annoying thing was the sleeves that kept slipping off the hot coffee cups! Dessert was just \"ok\", too many cheesecake options, but none of them appetizing. Would be nice if they had some cookies, brownies or even chocolate cheesecake.

I will stop by for another visit to try out some of their food items and/or a latte of cafe mocha.

I shall return for another review once i do.

Ciao!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. The south asian lady mainly. My friend opened her own personal water bottle from her bag and she started embarassing us saying we can't do that and we have to buy from there, freaking out going on and on like we opened up a picnic basket. Everybody was staring at us like we did something terrible. It's water!! Who does that? You can't call yourself a place of service if you treat your customers like that. We got up and left. Ruins your entire day. Never buying from your place!! Shame because the cafe itself is great. Ambience, outlets everywhere. Drama ruins all that."}
{"text":"I believe I found my new favourite coffee shop that is within a reasonable distance from where I live. Although Tim Hortons is just right outside my house and Starbucks is just 5 minutes away, they just can't deliver the same quality of coffee anymore. 

Just the place I would go to grab a cup of coffee, sit down, and relax.. or maybe even read a book. The decor and ambience feels warm and cozy. The cashier is always friendly, the place is clean, and they have those delicious looking muffins screaming at you to buy one while ordering your coffee. Nice work Coffee Culture..you sure know how to make a girl want to gain weight! Their red velvet muffin and pistachio muffins were amaaaazingly delicious. You call this a muffin? I call this heaven! On top of that, the coffee is flavourful and strong enough but not bitter. I've returned a few times and every time the coffee is consistent and fresh (unlike Tim Hortons...I ask for 2 cream 1 sugar they always always make it taste like 3 sugar). I'm so coming back whenever I need coffee. Except when I'm in a rush to work."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews before I went to this coffee culture and the reviews were pretty horrible about this place. But I always have to try out the place before I can judge it really. 

Went there on a Tuesday night with a few of my business partners and one of them suggested the peri peri chicken sandwich and lemme tell you boyyyyy this sandwich was fire. Nice closed spot great for a little business meeting or meeting up with friends. Definitely would hit up this spot when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and ordered a BLT (w/o the bacon) and the chocolate chai latte in the evening. Awesome that they serve breakfast all day. I love breakfast anytime of the day. The BLT was simplistically good and the chocolate chai latte was perfectly delightful! Their decor was scenic and almost \"lounge\" type of atmosphere. My friend and I were very comfortable. The staff were polite. The reason I gave it 4 stars was that there were some weird people around. We left around closing hours while we silently passed by a staff trying to wake up a possible drunk/stoned customer who had fallen asleep at one of the tables. That's downtown Brampton for you. Other than that, I would gladly come here again in the future! (Just not around closing hours)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. Customer service is terrible and not worth your money. I walked in with an outside coffee to grab a sandwich for takeout on my way to work. A man working there tried to grab my coffee out of my hand and proceeded to yell at me that they don't allow outside drinks. Inferring that I was stupid to think I could walk in there to purchase a sandwich for takeout while holding a coffee in my hand.

I fully understand and can respect their rules but there is a certain way you should treat people. Especially your customers.

Just go next door to Sunset Grill. They also don't allow outside drinks FYI, but on the bright side they are very friendly and treat people like human beings."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Had coffee here with a group of friends last week.  Not a lot of seating was available but they helped us get a few tables together.  Very helpful.  Had the caramel carrot cheesecake.  Reeallly good."}
{"text":"2 star for Caffe Latte
3 star for the environment
3 star for service

If you come to Coffee Culture for their coffee, you will be disappointed. Even as an unexperienced and not too demanding coffee drinker like me, I found my caffe latte not up to par. The roast is really weak, I feel like I am drinking warm milk instead. -2 star

There are not many non Starbucks coffee shop up in Scarborough or Markham. You will find Tim Hortons in every major intersections but the atmosphere and the coffee need I say more?? Coffee Culture do have this nice cozy setting with arm chairs, love seats and TV on CP24 so you will never miss the news/market index/weather forecast! Yes how can I forget the free WIFI + 1 star

The service here is quite good. The servers here are nice and friendly. I got a sense it is a family runned business with the owner working in the store. My drink was served in a mug and this is really important for me :). + 1 star

I might come for coffee if I am in the area and in need WIFI so I can write my yelp reviews. 

I wish for the day that Scarborough will able to get a few decent coffee place!!"}
{"text":"Brand New Coffee Culture location right at the corner of Keele and Major MacKenzie. 

Nicest staffs I ever encountered in a \"Franchise\" Cafe.. I was greeted so enthusiastically that I was a little taken back. The cashier was so nice and I ALMOST gave in when she asked me if I want a cookie, muffin, sweet...\"oh they are really good!\" 

Cappuccino ($3.99) 
- the roast is a little too weak for my personal preference.. more like a cafe latte 

The staff was so nice, when I ask her where are the outlets for the electricity, she even walked around the shop and show me.. (+0.5 star) 

The interior is sparkling new... and just love the little armchair area with CP24 on! There are a lot of booth seatings... feels more like a eat in restaurant. 

Wifi is reliable and fast connection... really strong signal! :) 

The music though is like elevator music.. a little tad cheesy for my taste! 

Great late hours!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe to study and/or hang out. 

I recommend their scones! As well as their lattes!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to get your study on, to chit chat with friends over coffee, or just to relax by yourself and just catch up with social media. However this place fills up in the evening. Tough to find a good spot. I always check to see if there are any open tables before bringing in all my belongings to study!"}
{"text":"I love the location and atmosphere.  Not a fan of the staff and the  coffee isn't as good as it used to be when they first opened upl"}
{"text":"This is a new coffee shop that just opened in the Markham Rd/16th area near Mt. Joy GO station. The interior is brightly lit, nicely decorated and clean and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. My husband and I were so happy that a coffee shop finally opened in the area and it's not another Starbucks! I've tried their cappuccino, latte and regular coffee. They're all good. We are definitely going to make this our regular spot for coffee :)"}
{"text":"The transition from a bank to now, this coffee shop is incredible!  It's a very comfortable, clean setting.  The interior was completely gutted and redone.  From icecream, to specialty cofees, muffins and sanwiches and cakes... there is a lot to enjoy.  Many things you can't find anywhere else.  Pistachio muffins are delicious!  It's a great place to enjoy a coffee and whatever and do my work."}
{"text":"In summary, it fits somewhere well above Tim Hortons (though to be realistic, anything can be above them) and below Starbucks in terms of coffee. The atmosphere's good too, so it's not a bad place to chill at."}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since it opened a couple of years ago. The noise level is on the quiet side, especially during the day, which makes it a good place to study alone or with groups. You also don't get a rush of kids here after 3pm as the public library or Tim Hortons gets. Free internet, just have to ask for the passcode which they change often.

I normally order drinks and the grilled cheese sandwich, no complaints there. The baked goods, cakes and ice cream? I'm not sure how fresh they are or how long they sit out in the counter. However the red velvet muffin and the cream cheese carrot cake are the best options, although extremely sweet. To cover up the stale flavour? Not sure. 

I don't find the service horrible, but they could be quicker in cleaning off tables. I also haven't experienced any attitude in the staff. 

I'll keep coming back here since it's so close to me and a decent place to grab a drink and study."}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends to catch up. I have tried a few items on the menu here, but my all time favourite would def. be the \"strawberries and creme\" shake. It's delicious!! I got the white chocolate blondie cake and it was okay, nothing great. 

The service.. uhm, let's say one lady is EXTREMELY rude. However, the other staff were pretty kind and considerate. We just walked into coffee culture, and we wanted to put our stuff down before we went and ordered. She came up to us and said \"you guys have to order then do whatever you want, then you will forget, you guys always come here and forget.\" She could have approached us in a nice way, and secondly, what do you mean we always come here? This was my second time and a few of my other friends haven't even been to this location."}
{"text":"Came here to chill.  Cozy place to get some work done and they have a wide selection of food and drinks to order from.  I just got the matcha latte which wasn't bad."}
{"text":"It was going well... great place to study and salad and tea were ok. When I asked my tea to be topped up with hot water, they said it would be considered a refill and it would be $1.88. WHAT? All I'm asking for is hot water, not another tea. Any other cafe would have gladly obliged to a little bit of hot water..."}
{"text":"I came here three times (I'm not sure why!). The first time, after ordering an entire meal, I asked the gentleman working there for a cup of tap water, which he refused. His response was \"we sell bottled water only\".

The second time, I came with my two friends to grab lunch and get a bit of work done. Two of the three of us ordered food and drinks. The manager insisted the third member had to buy something to stay. What difference did it make? I overheard her telling several customers off over the hour and a half we were there.

The third (and definitely) last time I came, my friend ordered a salad and requested that it doesn't come with cheese because she has a severe intolerance. The order arrives and obviously, the salad has cheese. Simple mistake, right? She makes them aware of the mistake and they apologize and take it back to remake it. She gets the salad back and there's cheese residue all over the salad... seems like they just tried to take the cheese off (which we could have done ourselves) instead of remaking it! My friend unfortunately couldn't eat her salad and understandably, left extremely disappointed. I assure you, this is the last time I ever step foot into this cafe."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. I have never experienced hostility from the staff but have seen it happen to others while I was there. All I've ever tried here is the chocolate ice cream (super good! But a little pricey) and I want to come here to study sometimes, but the seats are quickly taken by university students who seem to stay all day. Maybe soon I'll be able to come by for a snack and a study date :)"}
{"text":"This coffee place is just ok. I find the service and the products are a hit or miss. If I was in the area and desperate for a coffee nearby I may stop here but the few times I have eaten here the food was only so so. I would not return to purchase any food in the near future. The service is so so. Sometimes the cashier at the counter is friendly and other times they are not. Also the person making my sandwich on my most recent visit was not wearing a hair net and I thoroughly tried to inspect my food before consuming but I was a bit turned off before even eating it."}
{"text":"In love with this place. My new favourite study spot!!! Try their classic clubhouse sandwich and hot chocolate, sooooo good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, not impressed with the service or quality of the food. Ordered the breakfast specials and the eggs were soggy and English muffins burned. Coffee was okay but not great for a place called Coffee Culture!"}
{"text":"I expect Vaughan to be the next cradle of civilization, the next beacon of math and science in the world, the next lighthouse of literature and humanity, the vanguard of Canada's foray into complex mathematics and abstract physics...

Nowhere else have I see so many scholars-to-be congregated together in such close quarters tending to the sciences and liberal arts as in Coffee Culture. With this study location and 2 nearby libraries (Civic Centre and Maple Library) the future is secure and bright.

Every table was occupied by students on the internet with laptops and mobile phones.... which meant no table was available for us who wanted to order food.

So instead we decided to go for a walk and then drive home to eat. But while we were there we decided to pick up ice creams because it was such a hot day and we hadn't had ice cream in a while. The menu (sign) said something about 'dark cherry' so I picked that. Not available. The sign also said chocolate. Not available. My friend asked for something else -  cannot remember what - and... yes... not available. So we ordered vanilla.

In the meantime, the two women behind the counter were rather unfriendly and uninterested. I guarantee you they do not know how to say, 'you are welcome.' They just look at it you, after you stare them down and they begrudgingly decide to shuffle over to you and respond to your order (which is apparently unavailable so maybe that is why they are not happy to see a customer), questions and thank-you with.. grunts. Seriously. The two women were like Groot. Hey ladies, er I mean study area Wi-Fi technicians, smile a little and learn to say 'thank-you' or 'you are welcome' or 'we do not have that (this one they should recite constantly) but instead we suggest that...'

Bottom-line: I could not tell you what their sandwiches are like (or even if they have them available) because every table had laptops on it and not food and there was no table so we decided to move on.

By the way, the ice cream had actual ice in it (as in crushed ice cube or water that had iced) and their interior is quite nice and cosy. I like the dark atmosphere.
However, no tissues or napkins are available anywhere (perhaps there is toilet paper in the washroom?).


Too bad every table with two or three students connected to Wi-Fi and supposedly studying had occupants which were kidding each other, being touchy-feely with each other, checking out their school-mates at the next table or looking at Hollywood Stars' videos. Must be a relief for the parents to have their kids out of the house and cluttering up somewhere else.
Finally, in fairness to the employees maybe they are unaccustomed to a 'customer' ordering food so did not know how to react to us. I did not see any food or drink on any of the tables and they were all occupied."}
