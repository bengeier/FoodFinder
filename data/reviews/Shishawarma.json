{"text":"I was at Yonge and Dundas with my cousins on a Saturday night and we decided to find a place to smoke shisha. Since we weren't too sure where to find a place, we asked the guys who worked at Paramount, a Middle Eastern restaurant in the area, they recommended Shishawarma. 

I don't know why, I just assumed it would be a fairly decent place to smoke hookah. Boy was I wrong. There was outdoor and indoor seating, we chose to sit inside, and noticed tables that were empty and hadn't been cleaned; food and tea cups were leftover. From the name you can tell that they not only serve shisha, but shawerma too, which didn't strike me as too sanitary. 

That seemed like the reoccurring theme at this place, unsanitary, from the bathrooms, to the floor, the wait staff and the shishas. Of course, no one forced me to stay; we were already there so might as well make the best of it. There was no real mood there, the lights were turned on all the way, the old timers Arabic music would play for two minutes then cut off for half an hour.

We ordered two hookahs, one in mixed berry which was good and the second in cherry which was a huge disappointment. I asked the server if he could change the flavor for me to strawberry, I waited half an hour, reminded him, waited another 15 minutes before he brought it out, it was a tastier flavor. The staff was all Egyptian, and their culture showed in the way they served, everything seemed to be in an \"Inshallah we'll get to it\" style. We also ordered a pot of tea, which was nowhere near hot.

One thing that struck me as strange was that the shishas were taped in the middle, between the glass and the metal part. Each flavor had a different colored tape, which is understandable, but it didn't appear to me that they were replacing it every time. 
How would they change out the water? Did they even?

Overall, this is a place that must have its regulars who could care less about cleanliness. However, for me, it's an establishment that I would never return to, not even if you paid me."}
{"text":"The WORST and i mean the WORST food i have ever had on yonge street.   I ordered two large salads 1) fetoush salad which it came with no pita on it! Hello that is the whole point of that salad, and  2) a tabouli salad with no dressing on it!  I also ordered two falafel sandwiches.  It all came to $22.55.  What a WASTE of money.  When I asked the guy why there was no fried pita on the fetoush salad or dressing on the tabouli, the guy did not say sorry.  He just said,  oh right we will do that now.  So the dude proceeds to deep fry pita chips and he was trying to do me a favour by giving me a side of hummus.  The hummus was the most BLAND hummus I have ever had in my life.  No garlic.  No anything.   
We didn't finish our food because it was so BAD. Clearly this place exists because of the shishaw service."}
{"text":"Agree with the lady below that they may not be sanitary but atleast I am not there for the food only the shisha and it is always the best ! Mixed berry and mango are so delicious, the service is always great the men there are very friendly with me and get my shisha out to me right away. Its a chill atmosphere with their music they play aslong as your with the right friends enjoy and have a good time! preferably would like being there in the summer since it has the outside area aswell ! :D"}
{"text":"I don't know about anyone else, but the only problem I found with this place was the service.  A bit slow, but the proprietor seemed concerned about his patrons. Much of the seating is outside, so he was always walking around making sure everything was ok.

I was traveling alone, sat outside for about 2 or 3 hours. I got there after 9pm, and by the time I left at midnight, the place was packed.  That's about the time they cranked up the music, but it wasn't what I would consider loud, and I was sitting under the speaker.

All I had was shisha and tea....the tea was an after-thought, so it took a bit of time to get it.  Other than that, it was a great place to sit and people-watch.  I got a shawrma to go, and it was fine.  As far as the cleanliness of the place, I didn't notice anything unclean.  The shisha was also good."}
{"text":"Decent hookah, you can sit outside, they don't really do much to keep the coals going but they give you a bunch of them. Shisha ran out after about 30 mins, they have free wifi, no much else to say."}
{"text":"Shisha is good and cheap but food looked really bad and unhygienic.

I only go there for shisha.

Staff is also kinda rude unless you have girls with you.

For shisha, I always get mixed berry. I love to sit outside, its one of those few places in toronto where you cans it outside and smoke shisha on yonge street.

Would suggest to only go there for shisha."}
{"text":"Place is centrally located to everything.  Decided to have hookah and chicken shawarma.  The staff was very friendly and they went above and beyond to get us seated.  Recommended to all who love hookah and something to munch on."}
{"text":"Positives: Good price for hookah, lots of space for outdoor seating, the tea is good and cheaply priced, and when my friends got parking tickets the owner gave them free bottles of juice. Very kind of them.

Negatives: Washrooms were very dirty (my friends and I had to go to another establishment because we didn't want to use the bathroom. I actually don't want to go here anyone because of having to find an alternative bathroom), cheap tables and chairs (our table was uneven and kept wobbling), very slow service, poor decor, and the rest of the restaurant was kinda grimy."}
{"text":"This place is kind of cramped and ghetto, but the shisha (and price) was decent. And of course, I gotta award some extra points for the clever ass name."}
{"text":"This place is so chilled and good to hang out with friends .... the staff are friendly and helpful ...food is good and cheap ... shisha and atmosphere are great ..."}
{"text":"Absolute trash. I have no clue how this sad excuse of a shisha bar has 3 stars. Hoses falling apart, tables breaking apart and 0 clue how to make shisha. They fill the bowls to the point that even one coal will burn all the flavor in 2 mins and you will be coughing up a long.  I wouldn't wish this shisha bar upon my worst enemy.  AVOID."}
{"text":"Shisha is decent here, although definitely not the most sanitary (looks like they change the hookah water monthly). I usually get mixed berry when i'm in a shisha mood and it's almost always been good.  The one time it was horrible, i asked and the staff swapped it out for me. They also tend to switch between blasting arabic or club music (whatever the staff are in the mood for, i'm guessing).

The outside patio is really nice in the summer to sit down and relax.

Wouldn't recommend their food unless you're starving and in a rush.. It's certainly not bad, but if you want shawarma there are much better places."}
{"text":"Was Starving and ended up at Shishawarma.. I had the  Chicken Shawama Combo which was unexpectedly great.  The place needs better AC which is why I am giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to Shishawarma a few times over the past 2 years, it is a few blocks from the Eaton Centre, but at a walkable distance. Not the most spectacular place, and I'm unsure of the hygiene and sanitary practices here. 

I usually get the chicken shawarma, which is good and filling. Shisha is decent as well, they have a good amount of flavours to choose from. There is always someone coming around to check to make sure the hookah pipes are working and will give extra coals if asked. 

It's a good place to relax alone and with a group as well, noise level never bothered me. It seems to start getting busier around 10pm, but before that there is no problem getting a seat outside or inside. 

I will go back to Shishawarma just for the relax time."}
