{"text":"Was very impressed by Joel's service, professionalism and prices. He did an awesome job on our very old and run down fireplace. Tried to fix the old parts and when he was sure they were shot, he replaced the parts and it works perfectly. Thank you Joel for a job well done. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Called Joel today for a service call on our 7 year old gas fireplace, electric switch operated, that wouldn't work.  Two hours later Joel was knocking on my door.  Very nice humble guy that took his shoes off and had a moving pad so no mess on the carpet.  Seemed very knowledgeable about the fireplace, did a thorough cleaning, adjusted pilot and fixed an electrical issue.  One hour later is was leaving with a check for a very reasonable amount of money.  Liked his competency and was very careful not to make a mess, very easy to deal with.  If you have a problem with your fireplace give him a call, he won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great service! Would recommend any day. Was on time and very clean. Even takes his shoes off before coming in to your home. Had all 3 fireplaces up in a hour. Joel is amazing. Makes it very easy to take care of something that we all hate to deal with!"}
{"text":"I can't even give this company a review!  I made 3 appointments with them and he did show up to one of them!!  I couldn't believe that he didn't call to let us know I would call to find out where they were and i would get no answer.  They are horrible and do not care about there customers. If you can't make it to your appointment then the customer deserves a curtesy call to let them know!"}
{"text":"Joel is fantastic!  If you need any work on your fireplace, call Joel.  He rehabbed my 1995-era gas fireplace which had been non-functional since I moved into my house several years ago.  He replaced the burner which was totally corroded out, powder coated the brass doors in black, replaced the wood & brass handles with more contemporary-looking handles, replaced the gas logs with pebble glass that I picked out, and basically made my old fireplace look and work better than new!  Shortly after I moved into my house several years ago, I'd had a fireplace contractor take a look at the fireplace to get it working again.  The burner was totally corroded out, and the other contractor told me that the fireplace manufacturer was no longer in business, he couldn't get parts, and that was basically the end of it.  I figured I would eventually need to replace the entire fireplace.  Fast forward several years...Joel takes a look at it, and it's a totally different story!  He said it wouldn't be an issue to replace the burner...and then he proceeds to tell me everything else he can do to bring my fireplace back to life.  Suffice it to say, I was thrilled. He definitely followed through, and I am extremely pleased with the results and the price.  I am a Realtor, and Joel also did work on a fireplace in one of my team's listings, which was found to not be working during the buyer's inspection.  Again, Joel exceeded our expectations and didn't just fix the problem; he went above and beyond and had the fireplace looking like new again.     By the way, Joel was very neat during his work, covering the floor around the fireplace.  He was also very responsive and good at following up."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate Joel for the work he did, but like many of the other negative reviews, Joel didn't show up. We emailed date, time, and location- I waited an hour. I called and emailed, but got no response."}
{"text":"Joel came out the same day (today) and fixed my fireplace.  Everything went well.  He cleaned it as well."}
{"text":"Joel got my fireplace working quickly and cost-effectively. Most importantly, he showed a respect for my home that is unfortunately a rare quality in tradesman and contractors. He went the extra mile to clean the logs and nooks and crannies. You can tell he takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"Scheduled appointment for a quote, rushed home from work so I would not be late, but Joel was a NO CALL, NO SHOW!!"}
{"text":"Update: After 2 weeks without an email, text or call Joel finally replied and he did show up and finish the job."}
{"text":"I spoke to Joel last Sunday (12/4) and set up an appointment in my home for this morning at 9 am.  He is a no show.  Phone calls go to a full mailbox and text messages go unanswered.  Beware.  UPDATE 12/12/16- I rescheduled an appointment for this morning at 9 am.  Again he is a no show.  No phone call, no text, no nothing.  One HUGE lump of coal for Joel's Fireplace."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with this company.  Arrived on time, was knowledgeable and thorough and reasonable for the service conducted.  Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Joel came over next day after calling because I had issues with my pilot light lighting. He cleaned all the pieces and fireplace and helped me understand how to stop pilot light from going out. Both fireplaces work beautifully now. Very nice and helpful individual and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Joel did exactly what he said he could do. He transformed a 30+ year old fireplace into an ultra modern contemporary masterpiece. Very creative at a fair price. Will definately use him for my second fireplace in the master."}
{"text":"Joel is as honest as they come, and professional!  He quoted us over the phone an \"idea\" of what we could expect, to \"get it up and running\", given my description.  I actually said, \"that's the price for you to just show up and assess the problem, right\"?  Wrong!  Knowing 4 other people quoted twice his amount just to show up, I was a bit skeptical.  Much to my surprise he diagnosed the problem within minutes, climbed onto my roof to ensure the vent was working properly, wore covers over his shoes, laid out a blanket, removed and cleaned the fireplace doors, the mesh screen, the gas log and the gas supply line - what a surprise.  When he said he wanted to go on the roof, my heart sank, thinking - this is where my price doubles.  Again, this guy is as honest as they come, the price was the same as his quote.  I would recommend him 110% to anyone needing repair or reassurance that everything is functioning properly.  Our party on Friday, and home, will be a little \"warmer\" thanks to Joel!  Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst example of professionalism I have EVER encountered.  Made an appointment for fireplace repair a week out.   Stayed home on the day of repair, and the scheduled time (1:00pm) came and passed.  Called them and they literally were like \"oh..um...we overbooked, and uh, can we come at 3:30?\"   4:00 pm rolled around.   I called again, they said someone called and cancelled the work order.  They couldn't even tell me who cancelled it.   DO NOT USE these incompetent people, especially if your fireplace uses natural gas, they are likely to blow up your home."}
{"text":"Joel knows his stuff! Showed up 35 mins. late due to miscommunication of our address from the woman who scheduled our appointment, but promptly got to work. The repair was a little pricey due to 2 components needing to be replaced, but I trust he did a great job and our fireplace looks great! Thanks Joel!"}
{"text":"***Update 9/17/17: Joel has paid back $400 of the $750 deposit I made. I am hopeful he will pay back the full amount.***  Unfortunately, I can't provide a positive review of Joel's Fireplace (Joel Walker) since I was only able to get as far as paying Joel a \"50% deposit\", BUT, up to this date, he has failed to purchase the fireplace unit and he didn't provide any installation services. BUYER BEWARE! Joel still has not returned my $750.  The following description and pics are being posted here so other prospective customers in Las Vegas don't fall victim to Joel's Fireplace or Joel Walker.  I was looking to upgrade my existing fireplace so I found \"Joel's Fireplace\" on Google. On March 9, 2016, I presented Joel with a $750 check \"as a 50% down payment\" when he came to my house to haul away my original fireplace. At that initial in-person meeting, I felt Joel was very pleasant and knowledgeable about fireplaces - I even posted a \"locals\" recommendation to my fellow Las Vegans for Joel's services on my Facebook page. On March 14, 2016, Joel cashed my check. It's been eight months, and Joel has not provided the fireplace unit or installation services as written in his Proposal.  For the past eight months, Joel has played \"text and phone tag\" with me as he dodges my attempts to recover my $750 deposit. From my perspective, Joel probably knows a lot about his fireplace trade, but I do not think it would be smart (or safe) for someone to invite this type of person into your house to estimate your fireplace remodeling project.  Please see the included pics that illustrate my interaction with Joel Walker. I plan to take this person to Small Claims Court in order to recover my $750 deposit. BUYER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I called 2 days ago to find a full voice-mail box. Tried to contact him through his website but still no answer.   After reading the recent reviews, I guess  I should be lucky he didn't take my money and ran with it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an appointment scheduled for yesterday (December 18) at 12 am. No one showed up. We sent a text at 1pm and were told they were behind on schedule and would be there at 1.30 pm. Again no one, and no communication. At 4 pm we asked if we could expect anyone to come at all that day, and received a short message: yes, in 1.5 hours. At that time we were already in doubt, and of course no one showed up. There was no communication at all all from Joel's Fireplace. This company is not reliable. Apparently they are too busy and not interested in taking on more work/smaller jobs? But we would have appreciated it if they would have told us that in the first place. We lost a day waiting for them."}
{"text":"Late for arriving twice. Did not fix my problem and took my money. Did not return phone calls or texts"}
{"text":"Great customer service!!!  Joel is a professional and gets the job done, his  prices are reasonable   I am very happy with his service."}
{"text":"Don't know how this guy maintains a business. He showed for an appointment that I had rescheduled with him personally the day before which he had no recollection of and I wasn't home. He then was a no show the second time and I've heard nothing since. As someone else said, I feel fortunate that I didn't get involved with him further. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Joel was knowledgeable, professional and punctual. He was also reasonably priced, courteous and efficient. He took pictures of my chimney before and after he capped it and explained how the new part worked. I highly recommend him."}
{"text":"Joel came by today to give my fireplace a tune up.  He did a great job!  He cleaned everything, including the logs and the rocks.  He checked all of the equipment and made a few adjustments.  He did not try to sell me on anything, though he noted one of my parts might need to be changed out within the next year or two.  He showed me how to light the fireplace myself, and answered all of my questions about safety and operations.  I highly recommend Joel."}
{"text":"Very Good experience.   Requested 3 quotes from Yelp, Joel was one of 2 who got back to me.   (Other was uncertain they could fix problem) Responded on a weekend night, we coordinated a service time, had to tweak a bit in the end, but he showed up on time as promised.  Spent two hours getting my indoor gas fireplace working and charged an extremely fair price.   Will be recommending to neighbors who are having same issue."}
{"text":"Joel was great. He was able to come out the same day and fix our fireplace. We tried to call a couple of other places before Joel's and none serviced our brand of fireplace. He came out in a timely manner and cleaned and repaired our fireplace. Service was quick and professional."}
{"text":"Joel was great! He spent over two hours fixing my fireplace even putting in a new igniter for $120. He's a perfectionist and I highly recommend him."}
{"text":"I called Joel to see if I could get some help with our 19 year old gas fireplace.  It was installed by the builder, and it never had much of a flame. In fact, we thought the flame looked like one of the burners on our gas stove.  Joel was right on time for our appointment. He was very thorough and neat, and by the time he left we had a nice cozy fire in the fireplace!  I am thrilled to have it working, and I can't thank him enough. I am sure that if you need help with your fireplace, you will be very happy with Joel. He was knowledgeable, and fairly priced. I would definitely call Joel in the future for service."}
{"text":"Joel is terrific.  He took great care working on our fireplace making sure not to create a mess.  In addition to getting our gas fireplace working top notch again, he manipulated the air flow to create a more attractive flame and cleaned the logs and components.  He was on time and charged a very reasonable rate.  Joel took pride in his work and you can tell he has a wealth of experience."}
{"text":"Joel arrived on time to install my fireplace and overall, I am satisfied with the work he did.  It did take him almost 6.5 hours to install the fireplace, but a lot of that had to do with power saw malfunctions and maybe not having the right tools or help to get the job done quicker.  His price for the job was reasonable and I feel I received what was promised to me in the end."}
{"text":"Joel is awesome! He had a same day appointment available so he came out, fixed up our gas fireplace and cleaned it up so it looks brand new. Great service!"}
{"text":"************* BUYER BEWARE ******************  Nil customer service. Don't waste your time. Joel has taken 50% deposit and has done nothing - it's been 1 month now and STILL no return calls, nil contact - nothing. Each time I've called the number (702) 202-5692, a woman answers and whenever I've asked to speak to Joel, she hangs up.   BUYER BEWARE!!!   This guy is bad news. I intend to file a claim in Small Claims Court and retrieve my money as I have a receipt from him. I also intend to file a theft report with the Police as he is holding on to my fireplace parts.  ************* BUYER BEWARE ******************"}
{"text":"The Good - The Bad & The Ugly  The Good:    Cleaned one fireplace upstairs and completely renewed the big one in the family room. His work was excellent. He really know his stuff. When he is doing the work he is very professional. It looks so much better. The price he charged us was more then fair. The Bad: Like many of the negative reviews on here, he never showed up on time...not once. The Ugly: Once he just did not show up at all.....A total waste of our day. Special Note: If you can live with this....I would recommend him... As I mentioned the work he did  was perfect.....And yes I would have him back in my home. Ciao"}
{"text":"I scheduled an appointment 2 days ago for Joel to show up today at 9am. He is a no show and doesn't answer his phone and his voicemail is full. After reading the recent reviews I guess this is very common. I will now reach out to another dependable company."}
{"text":"A very pleasant experience.  He came right away and I felt that I got a good value for his time and trip."}
{"text":"Joel is the bomb! He came out same day for a estimate, answered my million questions thoroughly and patiently and even pulled the lost manual of the internet for me to.  He has proven a home inspector wrong with his opinion and saved me a ton of money on unnecessary repairs. The customer service Joel provided  is hard  if not impossible to find!"}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have used Joel to install a fireplace for us.   The first time (5 years ago), he installed the fireplace when only my husband was home.   When I got home later, the fireplace had been installed too high.   Joel came back and put it exactly where I wanted it and never charged us extra!   So when we recently bought another house, we wanted the new linear crystal fireplace installed instead of the old square kind that the house had.  We called around and could get no one to even give us a quote.   I called up the company Joel had worked for when he did our fireplace 5 years ago but he wasn't working there any longer.   I googled his name to find he has his own company now.   So we called him and he installed our new fireplace beautifully.   Very exacting workmanship.   I definitely recommend him."}
{"text":"He was great. Would recommend 10/10. Simple. Professional. Showed up and got them fixed up and looking good...one of them is still a bit questionable...but it is an old fireplace and he did show me how to get it working - with a little nudge they always come on now! Thank you Joel!"}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THIS GUY....  I specifically asked if he could should me proper fp lighting etc, because this is my first unit of this type ((BEFORE he arrived, I made sure this was part of service))  starts off with \"my logs are wrong\" not really but wrong.  Ok... WTF does that mean.   Then he pulls down the flap from overhead and then pulls apart the tube going to chimney.    Then proceeds to tell me, he can't reach to put it back together again.   WTF again.  And.....while he is \"Breaking\" my fireplace....he takes a call on speaker phone no less.....and quotes the guy 100.00 for the exact same job....    that he charges me 110.00 for.  YEP    you my friend are not smart.  I asked where pilot light was (turned out it was under two metal plates) --- he had put it back together without showing me at this point ---- and huffs and disassembles the base again.   Well n/s dude that's what the \"teach me how to light it part of the service includes\".....  I just in good conscious ---- can not recommend this guy.      Charges females different from male callers and breaks stuff I never asked to have fixed in the first place."}
