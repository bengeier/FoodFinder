{"text":"Super cute family owned shop! Delicious peanut sauce on their $2 chow mien. I've had it 3 times already now and it's so addicting! Haven't had anything else here though but the staff is warm and friendly. They genuinely make me want to support local businesses."}
{"text":"very nice owners and the food they sell prepared at the window is pretty good. unfortunately, with the sushi you get what you pay for. The salmon tasted old, the avocado wasn't  fresh, and the wasabi was so old it was spicy anymore. All in all, it kind of taste like Palmolive."}
{"text":"sago is a decent spot for a quick bite. not much ambiance and not the best sushi you'll ever eat...but it's good enough. they have your typical selection of rolls, and i liked that they have small rolls on the menu for when you just want something light and cheap. the menu has a nice selection of vegetarian sushi as well- i recommend the veggie tempura maki if you're a sweet potato fan (and who isn't...right?)  if i lived in the area, i could see this restaurant being a go-to spot for cheap take-out or delivery."}
