{"text":"Le banh mi semblait correct mais le général tao est terrible. Ça goûtait le gaz qu'ils utilisent pour faire flamber le plat.  Les nouilles en accompagnement étaient bonnes.  Rouleaux impériaux très ordinaires. Par contre les quantités sont très généreuses pour le prix."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect !  Best general Tao I've tasted !! Generous portion.  I love the fact that I don't need to pay extra to get an imperial roll. The new Gua Bao is excellent !  I've tried other places but this is the only place I can take 2 Gua Bao at a time.  Not oily, and not fatty at all.  Service is very good!  I had a very good time with my 2 friends.  I definitely will go back soon"}
{"text":"Great value and generous portions. The staff begins the counter are so friendly that I felt compelled to write this review!"}
{"text":"Friendly business ,great  food for its value , ordered general tao with pad thai ,everything tasted really fresh ."}
{"text":"I would say this is an Asian fast food joint, the food here is cheap and prepared quickly. 
The service is friendly and the portions are pretty big. Their chicken wings are pretty tasty too.
Don't expect this place to be over the top, stir fry come with too much sauce, but for the price you pay it's a good value."}
{"text":"The food was okay but honestly I've been to places that do better noodles for cheaper. The noodles were kind of tasteless and the summer roll had barely any shrimp, mostly just lettuce."}
