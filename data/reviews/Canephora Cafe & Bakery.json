{"text":"Great place! Clean and decent quantity and good quality! We tried the breakfast special and an omelet  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"No parking (parked on Lanbrook) and it is small. The BLT  breakfast special ($4.99 for 2 eggs, 2 big pieces of bacon, potato wedges and toast) are soooo good. The coffee is super awesome. Also sell a ton of Coffee and Tea accessories/machines."}
{"text":"Really love this place!  Consistently great service. The coffees are fantastic and so are the pastries and lunch items.   The seating, decor and atmosphere is cozy.  The hours are long and convenient as they open early and close late. Bonus is free parking both above and underground.  I hope this new place does well; they have a good thing going.  The only negative feedback I have is the name of the place...it's a bit awkward and not so easy to remember. Other than that, this place is a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was not disappointed! Breakfast special was $4.99, and came with two perfectly cooked over medium eggs, thick cut baked bacon, potato wedges and whole wheat or white toast!   Note that the coffee was NOT included in the breakfast special anymore. But overall still a great deal! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing, they have a vegan sandwich which is out of this world ! Recommended my co workers and they love the coffee, better than Starbucks !"}
{"text":"Very sweet place, very friendly staff. Had breakfast here 2-3 times, always a pleasant experience. Keep in mind they have parking behind the building with direct access to the cafe from there. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Customer service stinks!  Would not honour their word. If you're looking to book reservation for a group I would suggest - Stay away!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for a quick lunch, all their meat is halal. I'm not a fan of their drinks- I've had ice teas/espressos/smoothies which all were't that great. My favorite pizzas are the fig+goat cheese or chicken alfredo. Their chicken breast panini is also good, sometimes service is slow or sometimes its super fast. Most of their pastries are brought in from a wholesaler, typically dufflet or la rocca, so if you do buy one it is a little pricier than if you bought it at the grocery store.   I noticed on several occasions that the owners are always walking around and kind of staring at people. They not friendly at all, even when I smiled at them. The wait staff is super nice though. I've tried their breakfast once but I prefer to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for the breakfast special.  I'll note in advance that I am a huge stickler for following proper food safety and handling guidelines...  First impression: I noticed was that those behind the bar did NOT change their gloves from prep to plating once. Touching raw eggs and raw pork (bacon)... then using the same gloves to handle utensils and plate the bread and food does not follow basic food safety guidelines. The cashier would also touch money then grab your pastries directly.   What is the point of wearing gloves then???? When I requested that the gloves be changed after touching my raw eggs/pork, I was the one who had to advise as to why.  Now, I know that there is often far less practicing of \"food safety\" happening in restaurants behind the closed doors of the kitchen, but, out of site out of mind.  One would figure if it's on public display, proper handling techniques should be used...  Staff: Very pleasant and informative.   They did change the gloves when asked, however, this is something that could be handled in training/hiring.  Timeframe: It was not that busy, but our food took took nearly half and hour to get to us.  Food The breakfast food was average.  Nothing to rave about.  Our food was warm but some were cold. I did not try the pastries.  Coffee: Great  Final verdict: I unfortunately can't give this a pass based on what I witnessed. The food was just okay. I know this may not be a primarily a breakfast place, but if you are offering it some focus should be turned here."}
{"text":"Love the moccacino and the khalvav! The veggie omelet was good but a bit blend. Coming back again bc of the quality and the service! super nice and friendly employees!"}
{"text":"Nice and spacious cafe. Americano tasted great."}
{"text":"Leaving this review for Kaz. I parked my car in the residential parking garage behind the coffee shop (DONT DO THIS), and I couldn't get back to my car when I was trying to leave. Kaz was kind enough to help me by calling the owner of the apartment building, and ultimately helped me get inside the parking garage to retrieve my car. He really did not have to go out of his way to help me with my stupidity, but he did. Thank you Kaz... you have a heart of gold. As for the coffee shop... it's great (when Kaz is working)."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and welcoming atmosphere. I visit this place multiple times and I always order the green tea frappe, which is delicious by the way, and the food is all made in store so I know that I'm always getting the freshest food. The place is very clean and the staff are very nice. 10/10 would recommend to chill and relax."}
{"text":"Great place overall. Decent taste of Latte and cake. But poor wifi and limited parking spaces."}
{"text":"Great experience. I had a egg salad wrap and it was delicious. Service was friendly as well. Great ambiance as well. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a hot coffee on a cold night. So it served a good purpose.    I need to get out of cold and coffee was good idea . Thou it was decent cup of coffee but nothing too stellar but apparently breakfast is suppose to be good but we see."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast specials. They make their eggs in the oven, even the omelette. Greek omelette was packed with ingredients and still so fluffy."}
{"text":"We kept driving by this cafe and I've always wanted to stop by. Today finally got a chance to grab a tea.   Walking in the setting was comfortable. I've ordered a jasmine green and there was a box of two leave tea to choose from.   When asked which pastry was the best seller, the staff even came out to describe to me. I ended up ordering the almond pastry. They warmed it up and it tasted very good!  I've always liked independent cafes. I will come back to try other pastries."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try. This won't be the most enlightening experience, but it is a very nice cafe with excellent pastries. The staff is friendly and ready to serve. They smiled and were efficient. We ate outside and really enjoyed our time. Our waitress could have offered more suggestions and been a little more enthusiastic about the products, but it was nothing major.   We tried the chocolate mousse cake with raspberry which was a delight. The taste of chocolate and raspberry were distinct and refined. The croissant was good, flaky and buttery. The passion fruit and mango juice was exquisite.  I'm only giving four stars because we had an eyelash in our glass of milk. Aside from that , our experience was great and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a quiet cozy bakery, great for catching up on work and readings while sipping on speciality drinks. They have an outdoor patio, Not much of a view besides traffic. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and they unfortunately stop serving it after 2pm. I ended up getting a lunch special (tuna wrap) which comes with a regular coffee, but for 75 cents more I ended up with a cappuccino. The food was great as was the cappuccino. I'll be coming back to try their breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"Edit (Nov. 20, 2017)...well, service makes a huge difference in the costumer experience, I am downgrading since original review below. Seems to be some new staff that are not so used to working, keeping up, and being congenital at the same time.  Also having difficulty listening to their customers.  The store was noticeably less tidy this weekend and the coffee did not taste good.  Was strange to be charged for a full size drink and only served  2/3rds of it.  People make a big difference in the F&B world.  Maybe the ownership has changed?  Following is the original review, much of which is now irrelevant.  I've been coming to Canephora on average once per two weekly basis and always glad to enjoy a rich and well rounded black coffee.  I've had it both in house and take away and other than the slight difference in taste from the cup (all take away cups do have a \"taste\") the coffee is flavourful without being bitter, burnt or overly astringent.  It also has a good, ever so slightly silky texture which is a good mouth feel despite not having milk nor sugar. The coffee has also stayed stable through it's cool down from hot to warm, so there is not a rush to drink it.  This is my favourite spot around for aroma, flavour, texture, quality and consistency.  Aside from the plain black coffee, I've enjoyed their different chais and teas.  Also interesting is their pastry selection, and nice looking breakfast and lunch  a menus items, which for me is mostly off limits (celiac).    Much appreciated is their selection of base ingredients which feature organic (two leaves and a bud, zuma, doi Chang, reprocafe), natural (twisted Leaves, Blasercaf√©, Morala),  vegan (sweetbird) options.  There is also a selection of machines and accessories  Girls are nice and the occasional male working the counter has been efficient and knowledgeable.  Interior is clean and contemporary.  WiFi is available on request and it is comfortable for a chat with friends or solo chillin'.  Thinking about trying their \"redespresso\" latte next time, which is 100% roobios."}
{"text":"Nice, relaxing cafe with spacious comfy seating, modern decor with classical music in the background.  Service depends on who you get, the ladies are usually more welcoming then the guys. I like that their teas are by the front and each one has a description of the tea as well as the caffeine strength. They had samples of Fred's bread YUM!   ORDERED: - Cheese danish fresh out the oven - cheese overload and pastry was not typical: not flaky nor airy. - Chocolate Croissant - very sweet need some strong coffee to pair with this. Again pastry was not light, airy nor flaky. - Organic African Sunset Red Leaf tea from Two Leaves Tea Company - fruity tea served piping hot, not bad. - Latte - served warm (not piping hot), overloaded with stiff foam and uninspiring coffee art, see pic. It was ok.  Pain to find parking but a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"I just love this place, it's quiet and comfy, serves good food and has excellent baked goods. Everything you want in a coffee house including free wifi (ask for the password, it lasts for 3 hrs). Located on the ground floor of a small office building this place is a perfect place to stop and relax and grab a bite.  Every time I've been here the place is very clean.  The food is very fresh and the Mediterranean wrap and the tuna melt are our favourites. Everything is assembled fresh for each order and the care taken in prep, quality of the foods, vibe of the place and friendly service make this a 5."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (3.5 stars) Serious lack of parking as mentioned by previous reviews. I parked on Lanbrook as advised by another reviewer and walked over. The cafe itself is nicely decorated and clean, but lacks seating as well. There's some bar seating and then approximately 6-7 small round tables that can seat 3, but patrons are usually here alone. We had to ask a lady sitting by herself if we could share the table.   SERVICE (4 stars) Not much service to speak of. You pay at the counter and seat yourselves with your beverage. The staff will bring your food over when it's ready. Signs around the restaurant ask guests to bring their finished meals back to the counter to be cleaned. I didn't see anyone wipe down tables while we were there.   FOOD (4.5 stars) We ordered the Chicken Alfredo pizza and Western Omelette plate. Great pizza, made to order. There were big chunks of chicken, tons of cheese, and creamy white sauce. Fro 7.99, this was a great deal. Western omelette was fluffy and had lots of bacon. My only complaint is that the potatoes tasted a little stale. Coffee was good too - their mugs are huge. Small (12 oz) / Medium (16 oz)    QUALITY/VALUE (4.5 stars) Great food, nice ambiance, good value. If I lived in the area I would definitely visit more often. Parking and seating is a bit of an issue so I'd advise others to arrive early.    OVERALL 4 stars"}
{"text":"Beautiful, family-run cafe. I visited on a Sunday morning along with my family. The interior is spotless and well designed. The service was great and fast, and the food absolutely delicious. Love their tuna wrap sandwich. Cappuccino was one of the best I've ever tasted. So glad we found this little gem! Highly recommend checking out this place."}
{"text":"Lovely staff. Cute lights hung around and great coffee (flat white) and baked goods. Homey spot with everything you need: even WiFi and CP24 ;) Impressed by the specialty coffee beans for sale here: Moka Harar from Ethiopia, Too Chaang from Thailand, ReSipRocate...Lots of teas too!"}
{"text":"A stone's throw away from Yonge and Finch, Canephora offers a clean, cozy interior and above-ground/underground parking. These are huge pluses for me, considering the busyness of the surrounding area.  I arrived too late for the legendary $4.99 breakfast, but helped myself to a hefty, personal-sized chicken alfredo pizza for $6.99. It was an excellent recommendation, freshly baked and not greasy at all.  The chai latte, while fragrant, was on the watery side. Same goes for cappucino. This may not bother everyone, but I like my coffee bold (the stronger the better). I suppose you are still getting a deal by paying just under $5 for a 16-ounce cappucino - which is HUGE.   Most strikingly, wifi service is only available for an hour or so. You have to go through a bit of a process with the cashier to access this kind of service. This strikes me as being somewhat odd, because I haven't seen wifi parcelled out in such a way since, like, 2010. Most cafes nowadays either give you (unlimited) wifi or don't offer it at all - so I suppose this is a nod to older times?"}
{"text":"if youre looking for an alternative from starbucks around the yonge and finch area, this is it.  the people who work here are kind, friendly, and they know how to make a good cup of coffee! coffee jazz mixers down the street could certainly learn a thing or two - about coffee, food, and customer service.  the bf and i always come in for their $4.99 breakfast that comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, turkey bacon, and homefries. no oil or grease, all baked! so healthy! and it comes with a coffee! such a deal!  the other side of the cafe, they sell coffee items such as machines, beans, syrups, kettles, etc. and they run classes too.   highly recommend checking this cafe out. there is limited parking, and wished it was a little bigger with more seats, but it's warm and cozy! love coming here especially since its so closeby to us. ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good breakfast special and tuna. Relaxed atmosphere. Love the patio. Wifi is slow, so can't work here - but perfect for chilling. Cherry cheese Danish is great too."}
{"text":"I like these type of cafes. Nothing pretentious but a genuine commitment to coffee bakery and snacks.   Their prices are very good. Custom pizza (my favourite) or breakfast special for under  $7 each. Plenty of seating for you and your group. No pressure to rush out of there.   Only problem is the parking as sometimes it's full. If I lived in the neighbourhood this would be a frequent hang out place.   4 stars out of 5.    Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"A nice place to hang out. Warm and cosy. Breakfasts are tasty and coffee is great + good service."}
{"text":"The place felt very cozy, i ordered a amount milk mocha latte and its was served for me not burning hot and i didn't need to put any sugar~  There's free wifi for 3 hours (password for the wifi in the casher)   For the ones who dont drink regular milk they also have: amount milk, soy milk and no lactose milk~"}
{"text":"This place was my to go cafe until yesterday, but yesterday we decided not to go there anymore. Everything I tried there was fresh and tasted good but the service is awful! The cashier/server were extremely rude and both had so much attitude from the beginning. I've been there many times, other staffs were always nice but these 2 ladies were extremely rude and previous times also, i had a poor experience with the same cashier lady. Yesterday, we ordered special omelette, almond croissants, hot chocolate, and chai, and a tuna melt for the two of us. Although the shelves where filled with many many clean cups, but the cashier told me they will only give us plastic cup and plastic plates, because they were busy in the morning and won't have time to have the dishes be washed!! Like that's my problem! They even didn't give us cutleries after asking 2 times. That's not the type of costumer service you expect when you tip 15%, at a self service. She burned the croissants, the hot Chochlate barely had chocolate in it and the plastic cup was 1/3 empty (despite other times) and the toast was old and cold. The worst part was that the \"special\" omelette came with only ONE toast, cut in half!! Something you don't see anywhere in any other food establishment.... So I asked them for another one, and with so much attitude, she told me that I have to pay $4.25 and charged me $4.24 for one toast cut in half!! After I raised the issue to the owner, he told me it was a mistake. The owner was very rational and very nice and explained her that they should give us another toast at no cost. But things got even worse from then and that was when my boyfriend told me he won't ever go back there. After the owner talked to the girls. She waited until my bf finished his omelette and THEN she brought us this cold, old toast, as you see in the image, the very last piece of the bread (that you are never served in a restaurant), which we didn't even touch, as it had missed edges, maybe because she kept touching and turning it while she was behind the counter, and I was wondering why?! I'm not sure if the owner instructed her to give us that nasty piece of toast or was it her, I just know the cold, old \"toast\" was brought with with so much attitude....  something I've never ever seen anywhere else.... The two girls surely should not be in costumer service.... we were suppose to go there with 6 other friends and after this terrible experience we decided to go elsewhere, eat in peace and be treated with respect.... imagine going to a cafe and ask the server to give you one of the 20 coffee cups and she refuses saying, no, we are too busy to wash them later!!  And that's when the cafe is 1/2 full and there are only 6 people (including us) sitting there ..... That was the worse costumer service experience we had.... The owners, as nice as they are, but maybe they are not very familiar with quality service, the concept of costumer service the way it's acceptable here... obviously the girls didn't have the training in terms of customer service..... going to cafe is ones relaxing time, the time when you want to relax and chill .... not a time to be mistreated and be given so much attitude and poor service. P.s the only reason I am giving the place a 1 star is that the food quality is good, and everything is fresh, but the service was  -5"}
{"text":"The service was very slow during a saturday lunch time. I waited 45 mins for my drink and food.  Even though I ordered 2 breakfast special, only one came out and the cashier totally forgot I ordered 2 and I was glad that I kept the receipt to prove it.  I asked the eggs to be scramble for 2 times and they came out as over hard. They seemed to have enough staff working that day. I think it is just very disorganized. It has been the 2nd saturday that I had the super slow services. I'd rather go somewhere run more efficient to save my time."}
