{"text":"A big change since last year's event that was held in the west island and it rained.  This year the team brought their game up stronger situating ribfest centrally in Montreal 's old Port, next to the science centre. What a great spot! Music, games for kids, free entry- this event was bustling with people.  Rib game Introduces old and new faces like Oklahoma 's patrol Pete! Ribs on the half rack or full, pulled pork, chicken and Turkey for the non pork eaters - sides? Corn, baked beans, creamy coleslaw, corn bread, corn on the cob, deep fried onions and potatoe chips - fresh lemonade or chilled beer- you have everything you want!  Sitting areas are shaded off. You can purchase your own rub to take home too!  Great event! Great family fun!"}
{"text":"A new staple in Montreal for me!   I love ribs and if you love ribs, this is the place to be. First off, it smells amazing. You enter and it wafts over you like a warm blanket. Secondly, these rib food trucks mean business. I'm talking giant posters, trophy cases, and sauce samples galore. Everything to make you try their ribs.  And last, they have tiger paper towels to make sure that, no matter how messy you get from eating ribs, you will be able to clean up  Only bummer is most of it is cash only. They have an ATM on site but I have no time to deal with ATM fees (amirite?)   All the ribs I tried were amazing honestly. This is such a fun activity for the whole family (yeah, I'm the kind of person who says \"for the whole family\" now because I want my whole family to taste the ribs they have here)  Can't wait to come back next year :D"}
{"text":"Had to come back to this ribfest with some friends. I have to say that I preferred the ribs from Bone's daddy's. Really cool place to chill, have a beer and eat."}
{"text":"It was very good. I absolutely totally loved winning a gift card from Yelp to bring. But ultimately I'd hafta agree with Jason who once said that the Old Port would not be a good location for this fest.   Being that we came on Saturday afternoon after 2 solid days of rain: we were just like pigs on a farm, trudging through big piles of mud and hay to stuff our pie holes lol. I was covered in mud from the knees down n we only stayed about an hour n a half... Still didn't deter me from enjoying the ribs!  My other qualm with this festival is that I wanted to try stuff from every kiosk ...but that woulda been impossible even getting (say) a half rack \"only\" from each place. As it was I took a rack n a half home with me for dinner cuz the stomach wasn't guna accommodate everything there at that moment.  It shoulda been more set up like beer fest, where when u enter u exchange money for coupons and then (for example) 3 coupons would get u two ribs like a sampler from a rack. Or 6 coupons would get u 2 ribs and a sampler portion of pulled pork etc. (Still with the option to buy the half racks and full racks n chicken n pulled pork as per their prices for cash tho...that woulda kicked ass & they woulda made farrrr more money off of me).  I purchased from 3 of the 6 Rib kiosks (as well as one of the bars), and tried the sauce on a plastic fork from 5 of the 6 kiosks. The only sauce I didn't try was that from Smoking Bbq in Mtl for 2 reasons: they were entirely surrounded by mud so unaccessible and they're from Mtl anyways, so I can try 'em whenever I want.   Without intending to influence any judges of the contest (and the reason for waiting til Sunday afternoon for posting this): BONE DADDY's ribs were FANTABULOUS, they would get my vote for the ribs, perfect melt off the bone, perfect flavours, perfect sauce and oh so much love. Mariko told me to try they're pulled pork, so we did, but it was extremely dry and chewy by 3pm on Saturday sitting on the grill all day...so I wouldn't vote for their pulled pork though I still very much enjoyed.  Surprisingly the ribs from Alabama ( Camp 31) were a HUGE disappointment and I was shocked they were so the opposite of everything i thought they would be: wayyyy too salty on the meat, no love, cheap on the sauce and terribly overcooked, booooo guys, boooooooo. #1 i dont think so.   And I bought a sauce from the Texas kiosk (Bibb's Texas BBQ): they let us try the \"award winning\" house sauce first but it was their Chipotle version of it that I loved!! Guna be makin some ribs and/or grilled chicken realll soon!   Wish I coulda tried more, but so incredibly happy i got to try as much i did thanks to Yelp, I woulda bankrupted myself there without that gift card cuz as it was i still spent over! Looking forward to next year's fest: will definitely be a repeat offender!"}
{"text":"Love the setting. Amazing barbecue and high class competitor from Texas and all around the area."}
{"text":"This is meat heaven on earth! :) great ribs, chicken and even fudge :D beers, drinks & great people!! Do NOT MISS THIS!! Try as much as you can and as much as your belly can hadle! Hmmmm & the smell... ribs ribs ribs, here I come :D"}
{"text":"Long overdue for a review, no idea how I missed this.  Rib Fest is one of the BEST events found in Montreal, that is, if you're willing to deal with the crowd it generates. IT SURE GETS BUSY!!! Solution is to show up super early so you can get this amazing food with as little wait as possible. This year it was hosted in the Old Port, so the line-ups looked PAINFUL.  Other than that, this event is awesome. I love trying out BBQ from new places but I always go back to BILLY BONES BBQ, their ribs are TOP OF THE LINE and add that with some of their cornbread and that meal MADE MY WEEK."}
