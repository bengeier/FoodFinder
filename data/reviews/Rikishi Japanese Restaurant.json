{"text":"I love Rikishi.  It is a true 'hidden gem'.  I used to ride my bike by it all the time and think \"ew, I wouldn't want to go for sushi there\" - proving once again you should never judge a book by its cover, or a restaurant by its faded sign and dated decor.   MyJapanese friends recommended it as one of their favourites in the city so we tried it and were delighted.  It seems to be a small family run place with a grandfather-like figure who makes all the sushi.  My friend said it reminds him of a true Japanese neighbourhood sushi house.   The sushi is fresh and fantastic.  They have a whole vegetarian sushi menu too.     It's not fancy - but delicious, friendly, affordable, and homey."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and not just because it is in my neighborhood. I think it is one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto. It is more expensive than many of the places in the Annex, but when you feel like enjoying a great Japanese meal, this is an excellent choice.   There are also usually several vegetarian options on special."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite authentic Japanese restaurant in Toronto that will not bankrupt you - a hidden gem! Not your ordinary menu of California rolls, though they do offer them, but famous for their delectable tapas sized dishes not found in other japanese (mostly chinese-run) sushi houses in Toronto. The shio or sesame leaf tempura is devine and the mushroom butter foilyaki is amazing. I would highly recommend this place to lovers of authentic Japanese food beyond the usual fare."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Rikishi. It's a hole in the wall, and so precious.  I went there twice with three friends, and as others have mentioned it should be noted that there is a long wait time for your order. I recommend that you order first before you get settled in with tea. But I promise you that it is worth the wait. I am usually only sad that the wait would be too long for me to order a second round.  It is relatively nice and quiet in there with an old school vibe - no music to distract you from your company. Usually there is only a older man working the front counter quietly, and one or two friendly servers manning the floor.  The first time I ordered the Tonkatsu (Pork Katsu with a bed of rice), beautifully arranged and delicious.   The second time their Chirashi Bowl, which I highly recommend! You will taste no rice like this any where else in Toronto, served on a two-tiered lacquer box and the freshest of ingredients to go with the bed of rice.  English doesn't seem to be that well understood, but one of our servers kindly showed us her tiny Japanese notebook dawned with hand-drawn diagrams when we had a question she could not answer. Amazing in my books!"}
{"text":"I found this little place thanks to all of you fellow Yelpers who have come here and reviewed it before.  I have to say this is currently, for me, \"THE\" place in Toronto to have Japanese food. Made by a Japanese chef, the food quality is absolutely amazing. If you have been going to a bunch of run-of-the-mill type Japanese restaurants, I strongly advise you to visit Rikishi's, they will redefine how you see Japanese food :)  And for those who get this next line.... All my fives are belong to this :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto: not flashy, but consistently excellent food for a reasonable price. I think it walks right down the middle between a place like Sushi on Bloor (cheap, fast and a bit crap at times) and Hiro Sushi (expensive, slow and classy).  Interesting fact: I must have been here several dozen times over the last several years, but have never had the same waitress twice. Some kind of exchange program with Japanese students? That's our most popular theory."}
{"text":"I really can't figure out how Rikishi stays in business.  Located on Bloor just west of Christie Pits, it seems that every time I pass by this poorly advertised locale, it is empty. No one goes in and no one ever comes out. Contained within a relatively drab row of retailers a block away from Ossington, from the exterior, Rikishi certainly does not dazzle.  Finally, despite my fears of Hepatis A and food poisoning, I just had to try it.  What I found inside was a pleasant surprise. While the decor is simple, the place felt authentic. Waitresses dressed in traditional Japanese garb, a grey haired chef slicing up sushi in the back and  walls decorated with pictures of sumo wrestlers all around.  How apt.  Rikishi means sumo in Japanese.  The food was authentic and delicious. Dined with someone who had been in Japan and he said this was quite close to how they do it. I ordered a bento box with salmon teryaki. The fish was of excellent quality and extremely fresh. Paired with a small helping of steamed white rice and vegetable rolls, it was pretty close to perfect.  This place stands in stark contrast to the student filled dime-a-dozen sushi places down the street in the Annex, but costs double the price.  Worth the experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I, stalwart Bloorcourteans both, just finished our very first meal at Rikishi. As I type this, we are drinking the last of our big boy Sapporos following an all-around dynamite meal (which, incidentally, included a gorgeous dynamite roll).  On the speed of service, upon which other reviewers have remarked: we were seated as soon as we arrived by a friendly, attentive waitress who immediately took our drink orders. From the Sapporos, to the complementary order of edamame, to the bill, everything arrived quickly and with an appreciative smile.  On the food: we ordered a la carte -- miso soups, seaweed salads, agedashi tofu, 6 piece tuna role, and 6 piece spicy dynamite roll. I've eaten sushi at least 100,000 times prior to this meal. And Rikishi stacks up admirably against all the rest. Every bite was fresh and refreshing.  On the rest: were we the only people there? Yes. Did we have to wait in line? No. And that's a significant plus for this calibre of sushi. The decor? They have one. It's cute. The price? A bit more than average, but I can't imagine a better way to drop half a c-note."}
{"text":"Truly my favourite Japanese Restaurant in the city! Authentic food and lovely staff. The only place I can find that does REAL pork shogayaki. If you like Japanese food, skip places like Guu and go here."}
{"text":"Rikishi is a rare and unique gem.  It has been there for ages, despite seemingly to never be very busy.  Very out of date reviews from the late 80's or 90's appear on the wall suggesting that at one point, this place was actually on the world's radar.    I lived in japan and my wife is japanese.  Rikikshi is the only restaurant in Toronto that actually makes us feel like we are in Japan (given that everytime we are there it is only my wife, chef, and waitress, making me the only non-japanese person,that probably contributes to this feeling).  Its not like a fancy restaurant in Japan, but rather exactly like one of the numerous neighborhood sushi spots found near every japanese subway station outside of the downtown district.  Its a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than most (just like in Japan) but the quality and authenticity are there - and that's what we're paying for in the end.  This is a great place that should be more popular.  It's really a bit mystifying as to why it is not better known."}
{"text":"Today I was there at 7:30pm and my appetizer (Sawara shio-yaki, and an octopus dish) came at 8:30pm then my food (spicy salmon roll, chrishi don) finally arrived at 9pm.  The food was just right like any other Japanese restaurant.. Not surprising but don't get me wrong.. They taste good.  But I wouldn't recommend cuz it just took toooo long for the food and I was hangry.. That's hungry+angry.  The other table asked for the bill as soon as their food arrived... Everyone waited avg of 2hrs to get their order."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening.  Very few diners by six but the place was packed by eight.  The quality of the food was very good.  Inari sushi, agedashi tofu and veg tempura for appetizers.  Three of us had the special (sushi, ebi, salad, misoshiru soup, etc.) and one had the tonkatsu dinner.  While the quality was high, the portions left a lot to be desired.  Service was fine and the ambience was what I'd call neighborhood-comfortable."}
{"text":"A hidden gem, though not sure I want to let folks in on the secret, as I love the quiet atmosphere and simplicity of the place! Been coming here for over 15 years and won't eat Japanese anywhere else, I don't know what I will do when the owners retire! This is a good quality Japanese restaurant at not so high prices.   The menu is extensive and there is so much more to enjoy than the usual. I am in love with the Battera pressed sushi (marinated mackerel) and any of the others mackerel dishes in the menu. Saba tatsutage is fried perfection, especially with lots of lemon. Rikishi Udon is my favourite soup dish. The vegetarian bento has Agedashi Tofu which is amazing, as well as the freshest Wakame Sunomono. Sansai Temaki is a tangy hand roll.  Can't say enough good things about this place! Only drawback is that the chef is getting older and the service can be a bit slow, but well worth the wait, for sure!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday and will definitely become a regular.   The food was wonderful and the service attentive. I had the blackened cod to start and the steak teriyaki and both were wonderful. The teriyaki had thick chunks of flavourful grilled steak and the cod was perfectly cooked delicious.  The wine selection could be expanded a tiny bit (as the white selection is currently house wine or Mouton Cadet). But the food more than makes up for this."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of their dishes. Yes, the service may not be the fastest it but all explained by their carefully  perfected meals. This is not your typical trendy Izakaya but the most authentic good old day Izakaya that I appreciated back home. Despite the wait time which our server sincerely apologised for, we ended up thanking her for the best quality dinner I've ever had since I left Japan."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite Japanese/Sushi place in the neighbourhood.   I like it because the food is fresh and tasty, service is fantastic, and it's never full. I'm never quite sure how they stay in business because whenever I go, there's never more than 2 tables seated."}
{"text":"It really pains me so to see this place so empty even though I've only been there twice and both times were take out. If I were super popular, I'd invite all my friends to this place.  From the exterior, it looks pretty rundown. The interior isn't much prettier but it's cozy. The service is very polite and friendly. My Japanese isn't the greatest but I could hear the language of my distant roots being spoken in the back.  I didn't feel guilty for ordering solely vegetarian sushi (unlike a particular sushi snob chef in Newmarket, there is no shame in ordering vegetables). They have a good selection of vegetarian rolls and appetizers. I had to order the kinpira gobo since it's one of my all-time favourites! I know that it's pretty difficult to prepare (or my mom's a liar) so I appreciate when a place has this! It was sliced thinner than tiny matchsticks and tasted oh so good!  I've ordered the vegetable tempura roll, shiitake roll and probably something else but my memory is like a sieve.  All had a nice flavour to the rice though it fell apart when I tried to stuff it into my big mouth (I'm not the most graceful sushi-eater). I think maybe a tiny bit less rice would be better.  I was originally going to give this place 4 stars but I think their friendly staff, the good prices and the fact that this place seems to desperately need more customers, I'm giving it the 5-star treatment (for those who just look at stars and don't like to read my babbling review)."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was extremely slow. Waited almost an hours for the daily special."}
{"text":"Rikishi has been a family favourite for us for 20 years.  On special occasions when we are in the mood for sushi we head over there.  My mom can get quite adventurous.  It's been the same chef for 20 years.  He works meticulously at every dish.  The quality is great.  We seem to have a different server every time but they are always polite and informed.  Have some time to spare when you visit.  They have a room at the back that is great for a date to the right of the sushi bar.  Favourite:  Uni Sushi"}
{"text":"This place is a great value and has authentic Japanese food, unlike so many phony Japanese restaurants in Toronto. This place is the real thing and the staff are even Japanese!"}
{"text":"While I began to doze-off faintly over-hearing my Friend murmur of the What-zakaya opening few blocks East of Rikishi, I ponder if fate will bring the same Izayaka Trend from the Westcoast which left the more Traditional Sushi establishments in its wake.  Sympathy sets in slightly(not completely since I know one Yelper will keep all sushi-bars afloat on her own :P )...  Upon our final Attendee taking her seat, I woke from my dreams to realize my place in this setting that doesn't exactly shine with excitement but has enough Japanese feel to it.  I think of it as Old Motel feel with Japanese tidbits scattered.  Most notably it's the Japanese crew that kept it that low profile Japanese element.  While the Menu does incorporate new local tastes and diets(i.e. Vegetarian), it is still visible to see the old-school mentality, cooking methods, preparation and presentation.  The Nigiri Sushi was prepared by an experienced set of hands is held true, making it attract the limited clientele that understands and appreciates the Traditional methods.  Oshi Sushi(Pressed Sushi) was something that has always attracted me from cookbooks to television specials.  The aesthetics of a perfectly done Oshi Sushi is so appealing that it can be a form of Art.  I acknowledge that I might have over expected the same quality from Rikishi.  The Salmon version could have done better, at least to portion it to Nigiri bite-size.  Lucky 8 rather than 5 preferred.  It might not be one of the top Japanese Meals I've had but one thing I did admire was the Chef's Nigiri forming technique and the way he seasoned the Sushi Rice was flavourful.  Other than that, I didn't experience more joy than usual.  Maki's were oooookay too.  Solid 3'd.  Tempura, Tako-sumisu, Sansai-suoroshi, Yaki-nasu, Renkon-hasamiage, Sushi Deluxe, Spicy Salmon roll, Spicy Scallop roll.  Authenticity does bring memories for those that wish to remember..."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our order of the Sushi Regular. Its very pricey for a very small amount of Sushi. 14-16 bucks for 13 pieces of sushi. It is not worth it. The quality of the sushi? It was soft and tender but prepared awfully. It broke apart very easily.  The price wouldn't have been an issue but the waiting amount was crazy. The place was empty and it still took an hour. I trusted Yelp on this one and was highly disappointed."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great. That said we will not be back. When we arrived we were one of 3 tables. Our order took over an hour to finally be delivered to our table. This would be frustrating wth a table of adults but was nearly unbearable as we were with our young children. They are pretty good in restaurants but you can't ask any kid to wait that long. There was one guy making our sushi and despite the fact that we were waiting and my husband and I were taking turns with the kids outside so that they wouldn't bother everyone in the restaurant, he vanished from the bar for about 20 minutes... (and I was timing at his point, I was so angry). When I gave a poor tip for this, the waitress had the audacity to ask for a larger tip, which probably also means the staff are vastly underpaid. If you're childless and have the whole evening ahead of you, enjoy. It's the best sushi in the 'hood by far. If you have children, or somewhere to be, go somewhere else. One final note: portions are very small and pricey. We ordered what would have easily been enough at our usual restaurant but left discussing whether or not we should grab a chicken on the way home. Spent about $70 (no drinks) and we were all still hungry."}
{"text":"The food here is authentically Japanese, and it's fantastic. I feel like this restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem, as it is never busy when we go (usually around 6pm-ish). Sushi, tempura, curry...everything we've tried has been delicious. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is top notch and it's one of the more authentic Japanese places in the city.  The only downside is that the service is painfully slow and disorganized.  Last time I was there it took 15 minutes just to get water (and there were only 2 or 3 other tables at the time).  I think our meal took almost 2 hours from start to finish and there were only 2 of us.  As others have noted it's largely empty here and I'm pretty sure that's because of the poor service, not the food.  So if you have the time I would highly recommend it, otherwise hit up Ebi Sushi just west of here."}
{"text":"Cute place with nice service. The sushi was better quality than your average sushi place. An older Japanese couple own and run the restaurant and are very skilled in what they do. We got there very early on a Saturday night, so we didn't have to wait long for food but I could see how it could take long if they were busy. Feels more authentic than other places in the neighbourhood. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Please eat here so that it doesn't go out of business!! I can't understand how this gem of a Japanese restaurant has gone so long without proper recognition. Last time I went on a Saturday night, there was only one other table. This makes me sad.   I found out about this restaurant from a Japanese friend. I think part of the reason it's so quiet is because of the somewhat awkward location... West of Christie, it's just outside of Koreatown and it's East of Ossington before the Bloor strip gets busier. The area around RIkishi consists of mostly Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurants, video rentals, and convenience stores.   Anyways, the FOOD!! It's amazing and you can find a lot of authentic Japanese dishes that you won't get elsewhere -- e.g. natto (if that's your thing), pressed sushi (comes in these cool cube shapes). We opted to order a bunch of small dishes to share, like tapas. It's more expensive to order this way (instead of the sets or bentos), but great for variety. We had black cod terikyaki, mushrooms foilyaki (buttery goodness...), eggplant with ginger and bonito flakes, tempura soba, Rikishi udon, grilled saba with miso sauce, gyoza, lotus root croquettes and some maki rolls... Everything was beautifully presented, fresh, and oishii (delicious!!).  Also, there is a separate vegetarian menu with a lot of choices.   The space is pretty plain, with some posters of Japanese art. We got the private tatami room which was cozy. Service was attentive and polite. Our waitress made sure our tea cups never went empty!   We paid $95 (incl. tax but not tip, didn't order any alcohol) for 4 people, which I thought was extremely reasonable for dinner and for such great food. The portions for the appetizers/sharing dishes are very small though, so I would recommend ordering a few to start and keeping a menu at the table in case you want to add more.   Excellent, authentic Japanese dining experience!! Please see for yourself!"}
{"text":"It's a cut above most of the cheap sushi restaurants you'll find along Bloor street or in Korea town. I had the chirashi dinner which was well presented and quite good. The karaage was OK and the other guests liked their meals (sushi combo and salmon shioyaki). The decor was a bit run down but serviceable and the staff was nice and polite.   I've read a lot of complaints about the service being slow. I found it OK, and typical of the more deliberate style of Japanese restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. I personally preferred this over a place that rushes you out the door."}
{"text":"Takes forever, the Sushi Man is not getting any younger, folks.  So if you want true, authentic Japanese sushi, this is the place.  A little worn around the seams decor-wise, but I'm not eating the wallpaper.  The food has always been, without exception, consistently good.  Spouse and I have learned how to cope with the very slow service (re: sushi order).  Order a cooked vegetarian main to tide you over.  This place is great.  He is a Sushi Master, no question about it.  And I have spent a lot of time in Japan, so I have a good basis of comparison."}
{"text":"I can't get why this place is 4,5 stars rated. I checked it on yelp and had a date there. Oh, it was horrible! The smell inside, the interior, the sticky table... The food was okay, but the price imo is too high for what they offer. The service was friendly indeed and plum wine was good. But the rest I didn't like at all."}
{"text":"Indeed this place is a bit of a hole in the wall / hidden gem as it is unassuming with its faded exterior and retro interior but the sushi, sashimi, rolls and rice are outstanding - the salmon was so fresh and light tasting - very quality.  The rice is so much better than standard fast food sushi joints - sort of Melt in your mouth.  Had the chicken katsu meal which was great along with a spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll. If you're used to the crunchy, shrimp tempura stuffed dynamite roll then you may find these less savoury but you can tell the ingredients are way fresher.  A lot of people loathe about the super slow service but ours was perfect tonight - very high level very attentive and prompt.  Not pricey either $40 for katsu chicken, two rolls, salmon sashimi and dessert.     Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Cute and quiet, would be great for a date where you wanted to be completely alone in a very pretty, 1950s-built Japanese restaurant. You can even sit in a private little wooden booth that feels like a play hut.   The prices aren't very low for the quite average food - basically it's a trade of surroundings vs affordability. On an average night, I'm sticking to the joints east and west of here, where I know their fish has high turnover and I won't have to inhale that lemon-soaked velvet of interminable silence.  But on a night where you want to have slow, tense conversation and pretend everything's being shot black and white, this is definitely where to go."}
{"text":"I am having this strange feeling... I am on a MISSION to try out all the Japanese restaurants in GTA...   Which lead me to Rikishi Japanese Restaurant - a nice little restaurant... Super Friendly Smiley Waitress who kept asking me zillions of time if I ready to order... even when I told her we are a party of 3....and I sitting alone waiting....waiting.... waiting....   Love the separate Vegetarian Menu...It will make coming here with my Veggie Hot Date enjoyable as the questions of \"if any thing being harm to cook this dish?\" redundant.   The Tapas style Appetizer were quite interesting... the one I like the most is the Renkon-hasamiage (Tempura style lotus roots). I felt like I am eating some comfort food... excellent texture and with a tad of sweetness... taste much better than Tempura Yam.   Sushi Deluxe served the traditional way... the fresh fish went well with the shari rice... No funky strange rolls or sushi... solid nigiri sushi   Spicy Salmon/Spicy Scallop Roll which was the only request Roma has for the night were nicely done! We ended up making her share her rolls with us and forced her to eat everything else but the Tako-sumisu (Octopus)... (at least this Octopus is not alive!! not moving...)   Oshi Sushi with Salmon made me think of takeout food... small and compact and ready to go... all you need to do is pop it in your mouth whenever you desire... I wish the Chef would have cut that into smaller bite size pieces...   Rikishi Japanese Restaurant is definitely a neighbourhood gem! Definitely give it a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place re opened and is nicer than ever the decor is different and now they have an all you can eat menu. Major improvement. And rather busy."}
{"text":"Came here randomly to try out the \"pressed sushi\". This place is a hole-in-the-wall, and while the food was all delicious, I would not necessarily go out of my way to seek it. The place was empty when we arrived (on an early Sunday night), and so service was not an issue. The fish was fresh, but the bento box was a bit smaller than I expected. The chirashi really was a standout dish to me, especially the seasoned rice. I didn't find anything outstanding about the pressed sushi, just that the texture of the rice was a bit different than regular sushi, and I wished the tempura was crispier. If I had to wait very long as stated in previous posts, I would not be happy. But I would say altogether that it is a slightly above-average sushi place you should try out at least once."}
{"text":"Veg-friendly, good-tasting, and the service was lovely  :)  My companion and I just had supper there, and were surprised to find a completely Veg-friendly menu!  Complete with gobo/burdock root, hijiki, and inari zushi appetizers.  They also have a vegetarian Bento box - $13.95, which comes with about 5 or 6 different vegetarian items.  Loved the burdock root dish, warm and tasty.  They had plum wine, but didn't know what I meant when I told them that I wanted the carbonated version of plum wine.  I wondered if they had any family in Japan, that were affected by the quake.  Every person working there, was Japanese.  Cute Japanese mannerisms.  We had a good time, and tipped well.  It's Tuesday night, and business seemed slow.  If they were on Yonge street, their service would be bustling that much more.    Prices were good.  For 2 ppl, we spent $59 plus tip.  Only somewhat minor complaint, is that my companion wished for more of the straight sushi filler, and not as much filling gelatinous rice...  I'd go back.  Esp. w/ some veggie folk, and of course some omnivorous ones  :)  ~~~~~ btw, wikipedia explains Rikishi as: Literally, Strong man. The most common term for a professional sumo wrestler, although sum?tori is sometimes used instead. See  in Japanese."}
{"text":"Rikishi was completely empty when I visited tonight, and given the general lack of sushi in my hood I was surprised and nervous about the quality of the raw fish I was about to devour.   I was pleasantly surprised by the sushi. I didn't have anything out of the ordinary (some ebi sushi, california rolls) and it was all fresh and as it should be. I wasn't so much a fan of the things that normally aren't screw-up-able. Their miso soup was watery, their edamame needed more salt and the ginger salad had a mayo-like dressing. I really hate it when the ginger dressing is creamy. Some people like it. Not this guy.   The decor is simple and what you'd expect at a cheap sushi place. My dining companion and I sat in the cute little private dining area with curtains all around it. This was definitely a saving grace for this place. I felt like the wizard of Oz. Brilliant.   PEPPER'S PISSED: A little on the pricey side for what it is."}
