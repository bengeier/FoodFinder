{"text":"I would say the only redeeming quality about this place was the sweet waitress we had. It's very difficult to find as it's in a small inside mall and there is no sign outside. Thankfully the valet outside of Hodge's was able to point us in the right direction. We sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before we were greeted or even acknowledged. Then when our food came it was wrong, but we had to wait 10 minutes to tell someone because the girl dropped the food off at our table and walked away and no one else checked on us. I should also add that there were maybe 4 other tables, so they weren't busy at all. 

I like the idea of the place, the execution is lacking though. Their pancakes weren't good either. The pancakes are way better at the Original Pancake House on Chagrin Blvd. Unfortunately, I will never be back at Jack Flops."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast or brunch.  Unique and very very tasty food.  We had veggie frittata with smoked trout, burrito and Mexican eggs Benedict.  All delicious!!  Would definitely go again.  Next time will try the lemon curd pancakes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The Tiramisu pancakes were life changing. Cute retro decor. The root vegetables hash was also delicious. A cheery way to start the morning ."}
{"text":"I found this experience somewhat underwhelming, especially for the price.  My burger was ok, not great.  Can't really see why they asked about temperature since it was so thin.  And the fries were soggy, although nicely seasoned.

My daughter ordered eggs, sausage and potatoes.  Nice job except the potatoes were undercooked and still a bit crunchy.

For prices that exceed the typical for diner/lunch counter type of place, the food was only so-so.  Would still be so-so at a lower price point."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a tasty, unique breakfast with great service, may I recommend this place.  Price is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great choices.  Spicy good flavored Bloody Mary mix. 
Breakfast sandwiches are incredible."}
{"text":"I had the veggie frittata for Sunday brunch and it was fab! Good music at low volume, lovely staff, good coffee and refills. All great"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Interesting flavors, fresh ingredients. However, the place is small so I don't recommend coming if you're not willing to wait for your food."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place, especially for vegans.

At first, I was impressed - beautiful setting, in the Arcade, looked like a great brunch spot. Many vegan options. My party of 5 had to wait 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon - no problem. Once we got all settled and got our food, the disappointment began. 

Two of my friends ordered the signature pancakes. 4 out of 5 of us got our meals at the same time - one of those was the pancakes. The last girl had to wait an extra 10 minutes for her pancakes for some reason. The first pancake eater was halfway through when she noticed that the entire center of her pancakes was UNCOOKED. It was pure flour everywhere. She pointed this out to the waitress, who offered another pancake, but my friend didn't want one. A little later, my last friend's pancake came. Again, as she's eating it, the entire center is uncooked. She too did not want a replacement pancake, and was offered nothing else, not a discount or anything. Not sure if the waitress even told the chef as we requested.

Now, my food - I ordered the tofu hash and side of tofu bacon and was very excited for a unique vegan meal. Yet, my hash came as nothing except a huge plate of the same thing - diced potatoes, with a very pathetic amount of tofu throughout. No side of fruit, bread nothing - dish cost approx $10. It was good and pretty flavorful, but so boring - the same thing over and over, and I craved variety. The tofu bacon was a huge disappointment. For $3, I got exactly 4 TINY slices of tofu, not even crisp, just limp and flavored with some kind of bacon-y marinade. A complete waste.

Finally, it was one of my friend's birthdays, so we wanted to split her bill among the rest of the 4 of us. This was impossible, though. After being gone for 5 minutes, the waitress returned only to say that their machine doesn't do this and she would have to have her own separate bill. Ok, not a big deal, but annoying.

Coffee refills were slow. The service was very slow in general though the place wasn't completely full. The waitress took a really long time to come back with a box and the bills.

There are many other cute, vegan-friendly cafes in Cleveland to chose over this place"}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland for a conference, from Texas. Ate here on the last day of my trip, paid $15 for a burrito and $2.50 for a cup of black coffee. The food was average, at best.  If I find myself back here I know where not to eat..."}
{"text":"I spent a week in Cleveland. I was surprised and disappointed at how bad most of the restaurants I visited were. However, Jack Flaps was, by far, the worst of the worst. 

It's a small place. Maybe a dozen tables. Look promising when you walk up. Basic diner fare. I ordered something simple-two eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast. I asked for some cheese on the potatoes. 

Took a long time to come and when it did it was an unappealing pile of grey food. All of it - save the eggs - was horribly over salted. I have a high tolerance for bad food so I stomached it. I also assumed there was no point in sending it back as this was clearly a philosophy here. The\"cheese\" on the eggs was a prepackaged shredded parmesan - cold and unmelted.  The toast did not arrive with the food. The server or the kitchen forgot to prepare it.  !!!  

The service is lazy. I struggled to get our servers attention for a coffee refill. When I asked the other server, she declined as we were not her table but would get our server. 

Lousy food, lousy service."}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow, no sense of urgency.  I will come back to try the pancakes, maybe lunch."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland, \"best f'ing breakfast burrito\" did not disappoint.  also tried a bite of pancakes and they were awesome as well. Homemade sauces add to the unique feel of the place."}
{"text":"Oh my! What a find!! The BEST root vegetable hash and BEST blueberry creme pancakes. Great service,  cool vibe, go go go!!!"}
{"text":"I arrived in town with only an hour to eat before departing again. I found the luncheonette on the way to another yelp reviewed spot and the building was so quaint I couldn't resist.

I didn't realize there was a wait time for folks because by the time I walked in, my hour to eat had been cut to thirty minutes and I had hungry tunnel vision. When I approached the server about ordering something to go, they politely informed me about the wait time but also did everything possible to allow me to get a quick order.

Another staff person talked with me while I waited until orange juice, grits, eggs scrambled hard and thick cut bacon was packaged and  ready. I left on time and the food wound up being delicious. The eggs were well-seasoned, the bacon was plentiful and my bill for the whole platter and juice was only $9. Kudos to the entire staff. With so many customers, you took good care of me!"}
{"text":"Out of town trip for a wedding in Cleveland. Went for breakfast. Really delicious and different take on breakfast. Generous portions for solid price. Got the breakfast burrito which was stuffed full of flavor and meat. Home made hot sauce was just right (not too too hot, not runny). Side of wheat toast was particularly delightful - huge thick cut of grainy wheat. Loved it. Coffee was strong and full. Really found it to be a perfectly quaint little place. Seating is limited but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but was not impressed...sterile white plastic chairs in a small mall space. The servers were rude and unmotivated...there was a waiting list placed just outside of the restaurant to sign up and wait for the privilege to be seated. A waitress came out to tell a waiting couple to sign the list and didn't even bother looking at the list to see how many folks were waiting.  We waited for 10 minutes and no one came out to the \"host stand\" or deigned to speak to those waiting."}
{"text":"You HAVE to come here if you're in the area!!!  The food is amazing and the staff is funny, courteous and quick.  We had the burrito and regular pancakes and both were delicious!!  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing! We stayed downtown and were looking for a place for breakfast within walking distance. SO happy we were directed to Jack Flaps! Pancakes literally as big as a dinner plate. Had the seasonal special Blueberry Creme Jackflaps--delicious! Enough for two. My husband had the vegetarian frittata--really outstanding with a special tomato drizzle on top. He was also happy they had soy milk. I had a mimosa ($5!). Can't wait to go back to try their signature breakfast burrito! Crowded, but the 5th Street Arcade is a nice place to be hanging out waiting. Service was great."}
{"text":"We had an amazing breakfast here. The cornbread and chorizo on the Benedicto Mexicano made a wonderful combo with the eggs - chorizo was fairly spicy but great if you like a little spice and paired really well with the local beers available. My husband had the breakfast burrito which was huge! He loved it but it was so big he couldn't finish it. Even though they were getting ready to close for the day, service was very good and there was no rush to get us out of there. All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Lovee this place! Always packed on the weekends. We managed to get a seat and our server was great. We ordered pancakes, breakfast burritos, and sides of their breakfast potatoes. All the food was delicious and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the food but the kitchen staff simply can't handle a full house on the weekends.  Weekend morning wait time is typically 30-40 minutes.  Once seated and order plan to wait another 25 minutes for your food to arrive. They need a new logistical plan to handle the weekend demand."}
{"text":"Honestly with how long the wait was to be seated, I was already looking for something wrong with it.  At least half an hour wait for one person (which they warned about on the sign in sheet but the whole time there were empty seats inside which was frustrating).

Pancakes were good but kind of overpriced for what they are.  Got a side with braised beef over some kind of hash, which was tasty but the potatoes were underdone-crunchy, not deliciously-seared crunchy.

If you live downtown and are short on open brunch places walking distance, it's good. But I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I was traveling from the west coast and it was hard to find a breakfast place once I woke up. Finally I found Jack Flaps. Thank goodness for pancakes at 2pm! Angela was a prompt with service and helped me all around! I even made time for a screwdriver! I'll be back to try the Tiramisu pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"It's the breakfast place I've been looking for since moving here 10 years ago. Walkable, downtown, good coffee, great menu, and it happens to be part of the effort to restore life to the 5th street arcade. Food is great. Service is fantastic."}
{"text":"The pancakes are huge but that's about it for a positive review. The cooks busted a plate at the griddle and glass went flying. We were at the bar so had a first hand view of what was happening with the food. They removed part of the food and discarded it, but served the other side of the griddle to unsuspecting patrons. Lots of great places for breakfast around here so pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not good service overall between the host and waitress, poor excuse of a Bloody Mary, they were out of half of the menu items we tried to order, however on a very basic level the French toast and pancakes were yummy.
But you can get pancakes anywhere."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot in the Arcade district. It was little tricky to find, but everyone around will be able to guide you.  We ordered a breakfast burrito, pancakes and two coffees.  The burrito was filled with beef, potato and vegetables and it also came with homemade hot sauce on the side.  The pancakes came with cinnamon whipped butter and syrup. Everything was delicious. I would give this place 5 stars, but the coffee cups were dirty and we had to ask for to go cups because we were grossed out by that.
Overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice pancakes! Good flavor and size. Great place to have breakfast in downtown area. They have a couple of options in the menu and service was good!"}
{"text":"I order a vegan pancake and root veggie hash. It took especially a long time to make and when the pancakes came they looked like a clumps of flour dough,thick , very doughy and Very pale in color like it was uncooked..  
Tasted them and they were horrible they taste like flour and water totally not a vegan pancake. Veggie hash was salty. Waiter didn't seem to care much"}
{"text":"Super yummy! And there are plenty of options for vegetarians (and vegans!) like me! I had the tiramisu pancakes. They were gigantic and so delicious. I also ordered the vegetable hash which I would highly recommend! Our server was so friendly, and the service was so quick. It wasn't very crowded for a Monday morning."}
{"text":"Eww...I ordered the burger and it was so dry. I left angry and lunch shouldn't make you angry. Liked the waitress though."}
{"text":"Had recommendation from locals but saw recent mixed reviews. Yes, you put your name on a paper list which they work off. Worked perfectly. We waited perhaps 10 mins. The shop is small. If you want quick food perhaps IHOP works better for you. We had great and very pleasant service. Had flapjacks with berry compote and real whipped cream (no can here). Great pancakes. Fluffy texture to soak up the juicy berries. Husband had \"I'm just basic\" aka 2 eggs, choice of meat and hash with toast. Nothing basic about it. Hash was made fresh of fresh ingredients and the sausage was amazing. Perfect breakfast! Next time we're in CLE we''ll be back"}
{"text":"If you plan to go here for Sunday brunch be prepared to wait 45 min to an hour. The good news in the wintertime is you can sit inside the arcade and stay warm. I opted for the club sandwich. The super smoked pork belly and roasted turkey were delicious on crispy, toasted bread. I felt it was missing something but I don't know what.   Other folks at the table got pancakes which I thought tasted ok but I didn't think they commanded the price. Loud inside with the music playing overhead. It is a small space so if you like it cozy you will dig it.  Nice selection of seasonal eats like croque madame."}
{"text":"This is fantastic. I travel into Cleveland for work regularly and jack flaps, this one and the one in Ohio City usually make my early Monday's a little easier. 

The burritos are amazing and the cinnamon roll eggy bread (French toast) were sweet but not too aggressive especially for someone who usually goes for savory breakfast. This place is slowly becoming a breakfast tradition. It's about halfway down the mall and pretty small but worth the search"}
{"text":"A unique spin on traditional American breakfast.  The menu changes every three months.  If you want plain old bacon, eggs, toast, coffee, orange juice, this might not be the place for you.  However, if you want Korean Kimchi incorporated into what otherwise might be a traditional American breakfast - then your at the right place.  It's a neat place to go every once in a while."}
{"text":"Well all smiles here :) a friend (but more of a coworker) of mine got a coke and it came in a classic glass bottle. Maybe Pepsi should consider getting on board with this, but maybe they're not classic enough? I thoroughly enjoyed my walk into this establishment through the old arcade but I dont understand the Kilt store? But, thats for another day (preferably sometime in the morning - this is when Im the most on point because its when I consume high amounts of classic coke ;) OK back to business, it took me almost 10 minutes to get the hot sauce from its container which frustrated the left side of my brain. BUT the container and the entirety of the restaurant was HiP, so its a wash. I got a breakfast burrito and it was really good. However, the 'im just basic' item was ordered at my table and it was more intricate than I was expecting. I was thinking along the lines of a paper plate and a classic glass of water. The tunes rocked throughout the joint. Weird thing was there was a man sitting by himself at booth. None of us had the audacity to tell him to move, except me, but I didn't end up saying anything. Nice place to eat and smile."}
{"text":"I give it a three only because there's nothing spectacular or special about this place. I do pancakes but their basic pancakes. Service can be slow when they're busy. And they don't like you to use your cell phone. I wouldn't come downtown from the suburbs just for this place if you're staying downtown and want to piece of Cleveland it's good option."}
{"text":"No.  Just...no.  enough of the hipster, vegan, gluten free, vegetarian bullshit.  

Just stop."}
{"text":"Everything here seems so authentic. My breakfast Banh Mi was flavorful and fresh.my server attentive and pleasant . I will be back when in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Delicious sweet (Lemon curd Jackflaps) and savory (Breakfast burrito) breakfast items! Had to take home a bottle of the house-made hot sauce..just $2! Good coffee, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I cannot believe they only have 3 stars on here! Are people crazy?? 
Honestly I have never had a single thing that wasn't amazing here. Last week I got the breakfast Mac n cheese and I ate the whole damn thing which was like an entire box of macaroni because I couldn't stop myself I loved it so much! 
The service here is friendly and fast.
Don't buy into the 3 stars, try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love both jack flaps and the jack flaps luncheonette.   They take pride in the preparation of their food as well as the presentation.   It's a small place so come early or later to get a table."}
{"text":"Late to the party on this joint, but holy grubbin, it's MINT. 
gluten free waffles, pancakes, a veggie hash to squeal over, kimchi and mimosas and bloody Mary's, hollllaaaaa...and our service was TOP NOTCH. Shout out to Brittany!!! Love it there, definitely coming back!!  #GlutenAndDairyFreeLife #Brunchin #NirvanaInMyBouche #Bliss"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The food is amazing , however the terrible service will keep me from returning here. When we first arrived to the restaurant there were several empty tables yet we waited for 30 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we ordered quickly and waited yet again- this time for an hour. My breakfast burrito came out (delicious) but I had to share it with my boyfriend considering his waffle didn't come for another 20 minutes. Sad to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food, coffee, and service were all pretty good. 

I had the pumpkin Benedict without ham and a side of breakfast kimchi. The Benedict was well made and the pumpkin was interesting. It lacked salt in my opinion, but perhaps that's because I didn't have ham in it. Kimchi had an unusual spice and herb blend, but still spicy and tasty. My boyfriend got the barn mi and was pleased with that as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast.   Seating is limited. So expect a little wait.    The sausage, bacon, hash, pancakes were all great!   Their homemade hot sauce is really good -- definitely give this place a try.  
The cinnamon butter on the pancakes was really good too."}
{"text":"Good food. I had the f'ing burrito and it was good. Spicy and tasty. Coffee was good and service was fast. 

The menu is not very big but it seemed very diverse. Next time I'll have to try the lemon curd. The guy next to me ordered it and it looked good."}
{"text":"The luncheonette was right around the corner from our hotel and we weren't quite sure where the other location was so we decided to stop for breakfast before heading back to Youngstown on a Sunday morning.  I had read the menu for the regular location so was a little surprised when I saw how much smaller the menu was here, especially since I had already picked out the banh mi breakfast sandwich that was not on the menu here.  Instead I got the bacon and bleu omelette that was quite good with a side of root veggie hash.  The rye toast looked promising but sadly wasn't as it was somehow chewy and without much rye flavor.  My husband had the burrito that was quite good and their homemade hot sauce was a nice addition to both dishes.

Next time in Cleveland I'd like to try the other location and get that banh mi."}
{"text":"We came at 11 and every table but 1 was occupied. Staff and customers were friendly and helpful. I ordered the PB&J \"eggy bread\" which was French toast with Nutella, peanut butter, and raspberry sauce. The Hungry Man got the breakfast burrito. The cook and server had a good hustle to keep up with the crowd but she t did take us over an hour from door to door. That bring said, I'd return in a heartbeat if I lived in Cleveland this would be THE place for breakfast and brunch. Hopefully we can find them again the next time we're visiting!"}
{"text":"This place... So delicious! My boyfriend got the \"real effing burrito\" for breakfast and I got the Vietnamese sausage báhn mì ... one of the best breakfasts I've had in awhile! Also I got root veggie hash and bacon. Both yummy"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was amazing. Chilli cheese fries were out of this world.  Wish they offered all the time. Also had the Club Sammich. I understand it's is pork belly, but it was almost too salty to eat."}
{"text":"Can't even, if we would have been allowed to sit at one of the two available tables (available for 25 minutes) maybe I would be able to give you a better review... extremely rude server/hostess!"}
{"text":"As always, before leaving any city that I visit. I wanted to try their \"Brunch Scene\". I searched over the internet and found this cafe near the place that I was staying. I called them and asked if they have a reservation or waitlist, unfortunately they don't offer either option, which is okay. First come, first serve basis. We went to the place, it was so busy and packed (Maybe, because it was Sunday, I am not sure), they have paper out to be on their list. Wrote down my name and phone number, at that time we were about 10th/11th in line. I thought it would be a waste to wait so we decided to walk around to kill some time. After a couple of minutes we were wondering if they will call us over the phone since they have my number, we have no idea and we don't want to waste all the waiting, we head over the place, check the list and we were almost there 2 more parties before us. We stayed and after a couple of minutes it was our turn.

The place is pretty small and tight. Easily get crowded. They have a cute interior, especially the chalk wall where they have a hand written specials and some funny visuals (I like it). I am not a fan of the big utensil holder, it occupied the whole table, I mean the table is already small and that holder just took half of the table. After a couple of minutes they got our order, the lady who took our order was nice and friendly. 

We ordered:

Jackflaps Lemon Curd - Pancake was soft and fluffy. The lemon curd was amazing. The freshness of lemon and the creaminess were equally present that makes the whole thing so delicious. 

Cookies and Milk Waffle - Waffle is okay, nothing special. The cookies and milk syrup on top of it were new to me. I thought its gonna be sweet, but it wasn't. The milk balances everything. It was a good experience. 

Mimosa - Did not get a chance to drink it. 

Side of Two Eggs  (Sunny side up) - So far the best sunny side up that I ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. To think it was the easiest to cook, but so hard to perfect. I don't know if it was always like that, but I guess we were lucky that time it was perfect. 

Place:  Small and tight place. Small tables too. Cute interior. The only thing bugs me was the utensil holder. 

Serving Size: Average. 

Price: Reasonable. 

Staff: Friendly and nice. But we had a trouble getting our bill, it took us a while before we got their attention and asked for the bill.

Its a pretty decent place, I would give them 4 stars, but at the end of our meal, the staff seems so distracted that did not notice us when we were trying to get their attention for the bill, and seems like when you got your food, their attention just drafted away to the new customers, which is okay, but when you want to refill your drink it will take you a while to get a refill. To think at that time the place was not that busy. 

Anyway, I say give them a try, they have decent food and cute place, make sure to be early or try them on weekdays to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Everything from my fresh orange juice, to the jack flaps, to the hot sauce that came with my side of hash, was awesome. I've been to the Jack Flaps in Ohio City and the one downtown, and both are out of this world delicious. The service was quick and attentive. If you're looking for a brunch/breakfast spot definitely check out Jack Flaps! The only hard part is picking something off the menu because it all sounds so good."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Jack Flaps on a Monday morning before catching a flight back to Atlanta. The arcade was pretty dead and the restaurant was almost empty. The service was very friendly. Not feeling very adventurous, I ordered the omelette with roasted potatoes and root veggies, side of sausage and a bowl of grits. The food was delicious and the roasted potatoes with root veggies was the best part! The omelette was done right: the eggs were not over cooked and the cheese was nice and melty. Overall it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"I was searching for a brunch place while here in downtown Cleveland. Jack Flaps kept popping up, so I decided why not. It is inside the mall on Euclid. The menu selection was simple, which is a good thing. The food was awesome. I must say I was very impressed by the taste of the food. The atmosphere as nice also. The lighting in the diner area is low, but not bad."}
{"text":"It was good. First time here, big portions it's a good idea to split the for 2 people."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!! Can't go wrong with anything. We ordered breakfast burrito and I'm so basic platter. Good was absolutely delicious. Their cocktails are also good. My boyfriend ordered a cocktail and said that it was one of the best he's had. Definitely recommend for brunch. Cute and casual spot. Servers are really polite and provide suggestions about the food."}
{"text":"Life-changing flaps that are fluffy, yet crunchy, and just so incredibly balanced in taste! Not to mention the house butter and the syrup. Maple cinnamon. I mean...YES!"}
{"text":"First time here, was a bit concerned due to reviews.  We were sat quickly, order was taken, did take a bit long to get the food.  I ordered the Just Basic breakfast, I do have to say I was surprised on how well it was.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Can i post a zero? Can i post minus 100? Signed up to eat on waiting list that just sits in front of the place..nobody says a word to us and we wait.. 7 of us...including kids that needed to eat.. after 30 minutes and observing people being seated that arrived AFTER us, we inquired, and THEN were told it would be another hour... ANOTHER HOUR...really? As we left...the snarky lil waitress seemed to be amused that we still needed needed to find somewhere else to eat... if this place is representative of Cleveland, no wonder the entire country craps on you... kick rocks Jack Flaps..."}
{"text":"So confused. I love the other location so when they were opening one down the street I was excited. Only to find a Dicks Last Resort atmosphere. Open tables, yet 15-20min wait times. After seated, order taken, food came out a bit sloppy. Wasn't checked on and then the check came.

Take a deep breath, maybe hire another chef and a possible busser. Then dominate. We will be back but may stick to Lorain for a little bit."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch. Small and cozy with the ability to sit family style, if needed. Staff was nice. Food different but very good. Chose this place over our hotel breakfast. Greatly enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"this critics verdict? Despite the interesting twist with the spicy hollendaise I'd suggest the restaurant change the name of it from the \"Banh Me Benedict\" to the \"Banh This item from the menu Benedict\" jk it was really good but let's get to what matters here folks, the water. The water was refilled often and plentiful, there was no charge for the water as is tradition in the area. I am not used to the water from the watershed in this area of the country and had a surprising lack of metallic taste I would've thought for a rust belt brunch spot. the water was in other parts of the meal including the Bloody Mary and the other items I had as most food contains water at some level or another."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and ate breakfast on a Saturday morning. It's a small restaurant but very busy and popular!"}
{"text":"came here on st patricks day and had a unpleasant experience. food and service was less than mediocre and i even emailed them. its been almost 3 weeks and i haven't heard anything back. i really wanted to like this place but i probably wont be returning."}
{"text":"Questionable service and pancakes...

I want to start this review off by saying that I've frequented both the downtown and Ohio City locations of Jack Flaps and have had generally positive experiences with both the food and service. This place is slightly over-the-top with its brunch options, but most things are quite good. 

Recently, I had a very bad experience for brunch at the downtown spot after ordering the Red Velvet pancakes. It seems that this place isn't very good at handling any modifications to orders; I asked for the egg-less batter option but instead of the regular, but still wanted everything else that would have normally been part of it. Instead, I got a fairly bare-bones version, which was missing the mascarpone, etc. What surprised me was that nothing in the meal was sweet...the pancakes in general were fairly dry in some spots and uncooked in others, the berry compote was fairly acidic and the syrup was thin and also not sweet. 

I was surprised that the waitress never bothered to ask us how our meals were, and when I let the waitress know I didn't enjoy my meal, she ignored my comment and just took my plate away.

In general, I would recommend being careful when ordering the pancake options here."}
{"text":"Loved it. Although they were out of the ingredients for what I initially wanted to order the waitress made a recommendation for another entree (Breakfast Bahn Mi) and it delivered. The type of meal that you are thinking about the rest of the day good. My wife enjoyed the pancakes which are large served with a cinnamon butter and syrup. The coffee was also delicious. Would go back."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Food took at least an hour, and the staff had the nerve to get rude when we asked if the food was going to be ready.  Still waiting on the food.  I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The breakfast borrito had large chunks of fat, which at first I mis-took for mushed potatoes until I tried to chew it and realized it was definitely not potatoes! The cooks confirmed that it was fat and then proceeded to mock the fact that I did not want to eat the large chunks of fat. I would not have said anything if it was a couple little chunks, but we are talking half of my borrito was full of large chunks of the stuff. 
There were a couple other small issues but thanks to the \"fat\" burrito, I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Their check-in/wait list process is poor - leads to increased wait times, people get skipped, people are supposed to be called and are not ... a mess. We've been here twice and same thing both times - always a 30+ min disorganized weight. Creates frustration when it's not needed & takes away from the experience.

Once you get in people are nice & food is great. 

We'll be back but not soon ... hope their process is improved next time."}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes for a table, I expected to wait for our food... but not over an hour.  Seems that they were making the tickets one at a time.

The drinks were good, wish they had bloody marys - my draw was the bottomless bloodys.  But their paloma is delicious.  My rating is based mostly on the food - the vegan pancake was fine but there was a hair in it which I found at the end...

My husband's burger was raw. Like bleeding. So we sent it back. Rather than make a new one they refired the raw burger and gave it back to him. It was terrible.

The final irritant is they initially charged us full price for the burger.  Asinine. Once I complained, they removed the cost of the burger, but they should have been more proactive with the situation. There are a lot of restaurant choices in downtown Cleveland, this I would not return to."}
{"text":"They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I was walking around in downtown to find a cool spot and stumbled upon this place. 

I had gluten free \"I'm just basic\" with a side of sunny-up eggs and breakfast kimchi. Also, they usually have some dairy in their dish, but they can take that out for you which is amazing. I also asked for decaf coffee at 8:30 am (as I can't have too much caffeine ) and they kindly made some for me. The staff is smiley and friendly. The food tasted amazing and the price was good. 

If I visit Cleveland again, I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here twice last week for breakfast with the Missus and the Boy. This place is a tough one to rate. The servers and host are extremely kind, though the host I think gets a bit overwhelmed on occasion, and the wait for food can be glacial. The food itself is not great but good. Flapjack orders are large and shareable. Coffee was much better the second time than the first. Lemon curd on flapjacks was tasty. No biscuits were available for 45 minutes on our first visit. I think this place benefits from a relative lack of breakfast/brunch options in the immediate walking vicinity-particularly on Sundays. But the issues they have, in light of just recently opening this location, are definitely fixable."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts you can get in Cleveland.

If you're going to the Euclid Ave location, get there early as the good options tend to sell out.

Everything I've tried here has been amazing - but the shrimp & grits were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Everything from scratch. Angela in perpetual motion taking care of the bar in a first rate manner. She 'crafts' righteous ' mimosa with a splash of juice combined with a refreshing cava. Creative recipes. Delicious."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito and coffee are excellent. It's a strong cup that will keep you going all day. Service was great. Cool atmosphere. My daughter loved the pancakes."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going to flap jacks for YEARS!! My husband and I took my brother and his girlfriend this past December, waited 25 mins to be seated (not a big deal), waited OVER an hour for food (while the party we had to share a table with was seated after us and walked out before we even got our food), and then paid over $70 for breakfast for 4! The food was sub-par, and very underwhelming. My pancakes were so dry, and everything else was dripping in grease. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. I was hoping for better. Food was good, but a little pricey.. As everything is ala cart. The Flap Jacks were good and the two eggs easy over... Also got the burger with fried banana kiwi, fresh parsley and jalapeños sitting on a big airy bun. It tasted very good, but for the price, I expect a hand formed quality burger. Not a small frozen patty. With no sides coming with it the burger seemed lost on a giant white plate.  the place is cute, but service was slow for such few tables."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Waited 30 minutes while others seated ahead of us. When inquired why, we were told our party was too big and would be 1 hr. Didn't bother to let us know it was gonna be a wait and then had the nerve to smirk like it was funny to waste our time."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland and chose this place for brunch. It is nothing if not unique! I had the lox bagel dish--black pepper cream cheese and lox on an everything waffle--and my boyfriend had the real f-ing breakfast burrito. His dish was our favorite with super tender beef, but I've never seen anything like a lox waffle. It was really good, too!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place as it's very close to our apartment and I've always been curious about it, 'what's a jack flap'? My fiancé and I split a Cherry Cola jack flap; cola peach cherries, cobbler streusel, whipped cream; also the veggie omelet. The veggie omelet had caramelized onions, roasted red pepper, brie, and arugaua, which gave it a nice crisp bite.

I felt like the food had a pretty different, thoughtful, and uniqueness to it. The jack flaps were fluffy and delicious, with each ingredient complimenting the other. The omelet also had great ingredients, with the arugula and brie playing off one another.

It was busy but the service was still pretty decent, I felt the vegetable hash was a very nice touch and creative, more importantly delicious. The coffee was also pretty good. 

I'll definitely be back! As I finished writing this I realized I have no choice but to leave a perfect rating, as this hit every aspect I'd expect in a good breakfast spot. The prices could maybe come down just a tiny bit, but overall they're right where they should be."}
{"text":"Most stop!! Hands down best place in the area. Service was great and very attentive.  Chef was very nice and informative and the food was on point! I came in for breakfast and I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here and what a find! Hard to choose what to order because every meal is wonderfully crafted. I got their version of Spanish eggs Benedict and it was fantastic . Everyone I was with enjoyed their meals too- burrito and pancakes. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food here is ideal except in the fact of good luck going back to work after you eat pancakes the size of a small planet. It is very obvious that everyone is working hard. However, it is nearly impossible to get in and out of here in 30-45 minutes. I would like to go here more but just can't always spare the time from work. Love that there is a great breakfast place for a lunch option. They also server a few lunch options so it makes it an easy place to bring a group."}
{"text":"This was in an \"arcadic\" feeling location. And almost seemed as if it was a mall but it was a really a mall. The restaurant was small and cozy. 

What attracted us to eat breakfast at this location was the fact that we could have a variety of pancakes that were gluten free. However, wishing that we had more options for egg variety (mainly wish their was omelettes) 

They were fairly busy for a Friday morning- only one waitress was taking orders, seating and servicing. She was pretty forgetful and it seemed like overwhelmed which I cannot blame her.

Food and service were average- I cannot say that when I return to Cleveland I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!
Plain pancake was amazing 
The basic breakfast with pork belly was perfect and at a decent price 
Friendly staff and good coffee 
This would be my go to for breakfast in cle"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I got the Benedicto Mexicano and it was life changing. Don't even get me started on their home made hot sauce. If your looking for a place for a great breakfast meal look no further."}
{"text":"The coffee there is terrible. And the waitress seemed to have no personality. The food was.....different. the menu is small. I wish there was more of a variety."}
{"text":"Nice little pit stop before work. Quiet in the early morning which is perfect. I ordered a simple meal of eggs pork belly and toast. My eggs were completely on point and actually they were seasoned! I didn't have to add anything to them. The only reason they got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the past couple of times the pork belly has been really fatty but it's still good."}
{"text":"Never again. Not a bad place but they mist the target on a few things. No way to warm syrup and pancakes are to large. No one make pancakes like that ir just gets trash. No turkey sausages. Coffee not strong enough,regular coffee? taste like decaf."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews however after reading the mixed ones for the restaurant I decided to give them a shout out. Food was delicious and prompt. Server was polite and on the money with her recommendations. I ordered the PB &J French toast. Awesome. I will come back next time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Let me say that I wish I wasn't writing this review because the food was good. However, the service still makes me angry just thinking about it.

My friend ordered the egg/meat plate with corned beef hash ($2 extra charge), and I ordered pancakes (which ended up coming ten minutes later than his entree). The waitress noted that the corned beef was out and offered him the beef from the burrito instead. 

However, when the check came, my friend found that he was being still charged extra for the corned beef hash.When he brought it up to the waitress, she started arguing with him. She said that the burrito beef was the more expensive option and that it would come out of her paycheck (all of this over an extra charge of $2). It was very rude and made my friend uncomfortable. She had never mentioned any of this at the beginning of the meal, and she never went and talked to the manager about taking off the charge, claiming that she \"fought for the beef\" on his plate. I don't care what happens in the kitchen, you should never make a customer feel like its his fault for a substitution. 

I'll miss the food but I will never, EVER go back, and I suggest you don't patronize a restaurant that puts its customers in such awkward situations."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in a very convenient location. All the pancakes are excellent. Syrup is a bit odd. Can't put my finger on the flavor. Not bad, just different. Pork belly bacon is the best part. Hope to be back soon to try the other items."}
{"text":"Was in town for CLAW.  Checked this place out for breakfast.  Sat at the bar.  Waiter was amazing, friendly and helpful.  Ordered two eggs over easy, veggie hash and grits with coffee.  Food was amazing.  The hash was mildly spicy and flavorful.  The grits came with brown sugar butter.  The coffee was great and she offered a to go cup.  The guest next to me had the burrito and couldn't stop commenting on how amazing it was.  Another the Strawberry Quick pancakes she was similarly impressed large fluffy plate sized fest.   We are going to go back Sunday want to take my husband.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in with our 1yo while traveling... we were pleasantly surprised how excellent the food was. I had the frittata seasonal special and it was a standout fave. The wait time was a little long, but they even comped our pancake order when it took much longer than the rest of our food. (And btw the pancakes were worth the wait-- sooo tasty).  Definitely a fun and casual breakfast spot you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Jack Flaps is a solid breakfast/brunch place. Cleveland definitely needs more places like this!

PROS
-Comfort Food. Their menu is the definition of comfort food, at least to me. I got the mac and cheese with egg on top. Had I also not gotten a side of pancakes with whipped cream, I probably would have eaten everything, but my stomach does have its limits.

-Focused on breakfast and brunch. They are not a jack-of-all-trades, they are a jack-of-flaps. And they do it well!

-Accommodating menu. If you have food allergies/preferences, they have options for vegetarian, vegans, and gluten-free. 

CONS
-Being located in one of the spaces in the 5th St. Arcade, it is a small place. You may get to know your neighbors well - it's a little claustrophobic. 

BOTTOM LINE
-If wanted to live off of one meal for the day, feast your face off at Jack-Flaps!"}
{"text":"Took some friends from out of town here over Labor Day weekend. I've enjoyed the Lorain road location, and was excited for this one. Service was excruciatingly slow for everything. Our waitress wasn't overwhelmed, but just had a bad attitude. Food took so long it was cold. Friend ordered a biscuit sandwich with bacon on the side. She brought a biscuit on a large plate with a bowl containing everything that was supposed to be in it, including the bacon. Then made my friend feel bad for being vegetarian. Very odd person. All food was cold and undercooked. Flavor was awful. This spot definitely needs some attention. I was incredibly embarrassed. Fortunately they loved Lucky's last time they were here. Check out Lucky's or Grumpy's until these folks figure things out."}
{"text":"Had bfast today and it was so good! Had the burrito and was delicious and filling. They were super busy and the service was awesome. Would eat here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"There were several tables open but we had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated because there was only one server. We were also rudely denied seating at the bar as well because again - only one server. The server took 20 minutes just to bring me OJ and a glass of water. Never refilled the water until we asked her to. Food took forever to come out. And she took a long time even to get our checks. Food tasted good but the experience left a lot to be desired. Over all, if you don't have 3 hours to go to breakfast, this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday morning at 10:30. There were open seats at the bar and empty tables in the restaurant but there was a waiting list to be seated. The girl \"in charge\" did not seem to know what she was doing. Many families were waiting with us despite the open tables. After waiting 30 mins to be sat, (open tables the entire time) we continued to be ignored at our table. 
Ridiculous, unprofessional, poorly run is an understatement. There are only 9 tables in the entire place and the 3 people waiting tables said they were \"understaffed\" 

We had to approach them and ask them to take our order. 

Go anywhere else. Don't waste your time coming - it will only be an aggravation. 

One of the workers was asked how their seating system works and he ignored the gentleman speaking to him and finally said he didn't usually work here.

Update. Our waitress is Alyssa. She introduced herself after we sat for 20 minutes and had already ordered from someone else"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today with the family.  We all enjoyed our food.  The wife and kids said that their pancake were the best they've ever had.  My burrito was amazing! The side of sausage was salty, but was delicious in the syrup!!!  This is our new breakfast go to while staying in Cleveland.  Btw... the staff were all very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast I've had in a long time. There was a wait when we arrived at about 12:30 (Saturday) but we got seated right away. Our server was wonderful I believe her name was Robin. Everything we needed was immediately brought to us and never had to ask to refill water it was already done. Very sweet personality and friendly. I ordered the basic breakfast (2 eggs, a huge pile of bacon, toast, and root vegetable hash). The root hash was delicious! I was kind of scared to order it but I'm glad I did. Normal prices for a cafe. Had a great time and ate a delicious brunch. Definitely will come back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Get the real f-bring breakfast burrito, it will change your life! It's like eating spicy goodness that will fill you up! Their seasonal pecan pie pancakes are so good, you don't even need syrup. Definitely a great breakfast date place."}
{"text":"Worst service in the world. Absolutely atrocious. Tables open yet they won't seat people. Food was ehhh. Not worth the headache. This place should be featured on the famous Cleveland tourism video. Would fit in nicely."}
{"text":"Visited this little diner while in Cleveland on business. I was specifically looking for a breakfast that would cater to my gluten-free needs - and Jack Flaps delivered!  The food was tasty and the service was okay. My only real complaint was that the prices were wayyy over the top for such basic food. Pancakes and bacon should never cost $22 dollars. The diner was located in a little mall/galleria that is easy to find and in a safe/bright area. We visited twice while we were in town."}
{"text":"I almost have trouble putting into words just how horrible this place was. We paid $32 for two people to eat breakfast, so right off the bat the prices were extremely inflated. Now, I certainly don't mind paying for good food, but the food was horrible and the service was just as bad. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, which arrived separately. My husband was almost finished with this meal, by the time I finally asked the waitress what happened mine. She was extremely apologetic, but when we arrived they were maybe 3 other tables with diners. How long does it take to make a couple pancakes waffles and eggs? Apparently not that long, because it was obvious our food had set awhile before it was brought out, because everything was cold.  The pancakes were dry and flavorless, and the waffle was so hard it hurt my finger to cut it. The waitress could clearly see we hardly touch most of her food, but obviously didn't care.I don't even know how this places of business."}
{"text":"On my day off, we stopped by Jack Flaps at 1pm in an attempt to beat the lunch crowds. To our surprise, all the pancakes were $5. Happy hour pancakes = scorrreee! You cannot beat that deal.

Because why not, we ordered a few types of pancakes to try out the menu. The Lavender and the Lemon Curd were by far the best. Huge portions, great flavor and beautiful presentation! Its a total carb overload! I wish they would've had options for a side of fruit or just anything slightly less carby to balance it out. We also had a side of grits, and they had such a thick, textured flavor and needed no salt or butter.

The inside has a cool vibe. They were playing an Oasis station on Pandora and the luncheonette had a modern and young vibe. If you're coming to Jack Flaps, get ready to EAT! I simply adore the 5th Street Arcades and am so happy they are located amongst so much local shopping. It makes for a nice morning!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Food was delicious & service was great. We ordered there peanut butter cup gluten free waffles, the eggs, grits and pork belly and a couple more items. The grits were by far the best I've had in a while. Will be returning next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Really wanted to try this place for brunch since we were in town for the weekend. Maybe this place is good for Cleveland/Ohio standards, and while the price point is great in comparison to bigger markets, the dishes/flavor miss the mark for this Californian. 

My pancake didn't have the crispy edges. It was dense and absorb too much of the syrup. 

Burrito was just okay. 

Wouldn't come back. I guess if this is the best for downtown Cleveland..it is what it is, especially when options are limited."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and my BLT was definitely very good and will require a lot of running to burn off.  With that said the prices are more premium based and so far the food was good, the fries were just ok and for $3 for a side of fries I except them to be very good.  I will try again but for breakfast instead and see if I enjoy it more.  It also took a while to get our food which seems to be a common complaint by other patrons."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. The young woman server was friendly but the guy who was supposed to seat us seemed totally unhappy to be working (or overwhelmed even though it was only half full), and we almost left.  The pancakes (buckwheat), eggs and banh mi were nothing special.  The 2nd star was for the coffee, which is pretty good.  Wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Had their famous bahn mi breakfast sandwich.  Very vinegary with turkey like consistency parties.  They call it Vietnamese patties.  Wish the bun was more of a French roll and crispy vs a roll used for sausage but not bad nonetheless.  Not quite the Vietnamese sandwich one would find in Vietnam but acceptable."}
{"text":"I like this Jack Flaps almost as much as the one in Ohio City.  And it's much more centralized an convenient.  And also, since it's a luncheonette, it has both the breakfast options that I can get at the other Jack Flaps, and its own separate selection of lunch options.  

I had no problems with the service, though parking along Euclid is a huge pain.

I had the breakfast banh mi, which was just as good as the breakfast banh mi at their other location.  We also tried the Blueberry Port jack flaps (blueberry pancakes), and the mac and cheese.  They were both quite delicious; the mac and cheese is probably the best I've had in Cleveland.

The french fries (actually potato sticks) were fried well but a bit salty."}
{"text":"When my picky eating son says French toast is better than mine and asks me to check in and give 5 stars I must..."}
{"text":"Wow. So overrated . So overpriced . Do you like small places ? Do u like sharing tables with strangers ? Do u like a table so dirty your arms stick to it ? Do you like long waits for over priced food ? Then this is the place for you ! I got the shrimp and grits and it doesn't look the photos on this website . It was covered in some brown Mexican sauce with some bad tasting vegetable I couldn't identity . Would be nice if that was mention on the menu . Oh and true menu is dirty too . Rather gross . My 15$ break fast didn't even come with toast . Like really ? Can't give some toast for 15$ shrimp and grits ? My girlfriend got a pancake and that was decent . But it's kinda hard to mess up a pancake covered in syrup . Do not eat at his restaurant . Pay someone 40$ to put a dog turd in your mouth instead ."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Nice fresh ingredients prepared while you wait. The Bacon was the extra thick cut and the eggs and hash were cooked exactly as I ordered. Staff was friendly and service was fast. I'll return any time I visit Cleveland!"}
{"text":"\"This place is amazing\" pretty much sums up my thoughts on Jack Flaps. Going to the luncheonette is nice because it is usually way less crowded than the Ohio City location, based on the multiple times I've gone before 10:30. Also not bad around lunch time during the week.

I have only ordered the tiramisu flapjacks because they're just so good...even the 20th+ time around!! The pancakes are huge yet fluffy/light enough that it doesn't feel like you're being weighed down after eating them like. Also tasted the rice pudding, which was delicious, and the root veggie hash, which everyone raves about, as well that friends/family have ordered.

100% recommend if you're looking for the best pancakes around."}
{"text":"Cutesy, trendy. Good food but limited by their want to be different. That can be a good thing but some standards like jam or jelly instead of a berry syrup would also work."}
{"text":"The wait for food is crazy long especially for a breakfast place. Roughly 45 min. Chocolate pancakes are just pancakes with a small side cup of 3 grams of chocolate dust. Two eggs are smaller than any 1 egg I have ever seen. Total time for meal was 1 hour and 25 minutes. With zero wait time for a table because we came as soon as it opened."}
{"text":"Quaint place.  Nice atmosphere.  A different, homemade menu.  The sausage is amazing.  Loved the French Toast options."}
{"text":"Bahn mi was great - the sausage made it!  Pancakes are large and filling. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was top notch. She explained the menu well, and like a good server, had me wanting to order few different items. Worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in the arcade! Pancakes are crispy on the outside and just right in the middle. The F-n burrito is great for those with a savory side!"}
{"text":"I have not spent an extensive amount of time in Cleveland, however I have done a vast amount of trying new breakfast spots all around our great nation. With that being said I think you'd hard pressed to find a place even close to as good as here for breakfast. They had a great/interesting combination of flavors which turned the mundane such as breakfast potatoes in to an adventure for the palate. Pair that with some of the best pancakes I've ever had and you've got a great breakfast place in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Today I went to jack flaps to accompany two of my lunch Compadres. As we walk in no one was there to greet us. And when someone did she was quite rude kind of just threw the menus down and talked about what was missing from the menu as she walked away in which we could barely hear what she was saying. When she went back behind the counter she said how she was closed already  with apretty angry demeanor. it really sullied The Experience so we left. Honestly I'm not a big fan of this restaurant the food is fine but every location the workers bug the hell out of me. They act extra aloof. They act like the time of their patrons are not valuable. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Super cool place, famous for pancakes I suppose but... Bang Mi breakfast sammie + Bloody Mary! Who knew?  The everything cream cheese with the egg and Vietnamese sausage was epic. Tame Impala on the rotation too - bonus! One knock: coffee is true swill..."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here twice during the Republican National Convention.

The place was packed, but the servers did an admirable job of keeping things running on all cylinders.  Remarkably, they didn't seem to mind that they were serving Trump delegates, and apparently didn't poison any of them.  Now that's professionalism!

On day one I had an excellent sandwich of peppered gravlax and lardons served on grilled sweet white bread.  This was well-conceived and well-executed.  The sprinkling of arugula didn't add much and maybe would have been better as a small side salad.

On day two I had a prodigious breakfast burrito with adobo-braised beef and a nice snap of mild manchego.  This is the kind of thing that gets the juices going, but needs a few cups of coffee as a counterpoint.  

Cleveland now seems to have a pretty exciting food scene, a stark contrast with what I found on my last visit.  Jack Flap's is first-rate, and not just relative to Cleveland.  You should go!"}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday, and it was not crowded at all, however the place is tiny, with minuscule tables the size of a large coffee table book.  Our food took a fairly long time to make, but from what I understand they make everything from scratch.  The pancakes were large and fluffy, and tasted OK, but not too flavorful.  I was not floored as I was told I would be by some that have eaten here before.  Frankly, i've had better tasting pancakes at a local diner, or IHOP for that matter!  The southern style grits were very good.  All in all, a good place to try, but I think i'll stick with my favorite diners for the added plus of faster service, and much better value."}
{"text":"Not so good. Sauce on Madame breakfast sandwich was flavorless and gloppy. Too much bread to it and not enough protein. Trout sandwich was just ok. Not toasted as it said it would be."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I stepped in around 3:30P looking for a late lunch. The place was pretty much empty, and we weren't sure if they were even still open. Fortunately for us, they were. The waiter was super friendly and helpful, the place was clean, and the food was awesome. I got the Banh Mi, which had a really nice, balanced flavor. A little sweet, a little spicy, but nothing was overpowering. My friend got a salad and the mac and cheese and seemed pleased with his choice as well.

If you're looking for a good brunch in downtown, this is certainly a top contender. It's definitely been added to my list, and I would point any hungry friend in its direction."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito. It was amazing!  Huge! Full of great flavor. Wonderful shredded steak, potatoes, onions etc. it was so good. It was $10 though so it's kind of pricey.  
I ordered a pancake to share because it was enormous. But it tasted kind of weird. That's why I only gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"The weather outside my hotel window looks picture perfect. And the aroma of Jack Flaps floats through the air calling my name.

The menu is not extensive, there aren't a million omelet options nor are there 50 different kinds of pancakes. But for someone like myself who is more and more indecisive when it comes to ordering....well, forget that, it's no easy task here.

Everything looks mouthwatering. But it was the basic breakfast that has me dreaming of thick cut pork belly which will bring any bacon lover to their knees. And if you're a carb lover, the toast here is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Loud,crowded,  poor slow service, cold food, way overrated.  Pick another spot. 10 people on waiting lists and empty tables because the kitchen could not keep up."}
{"text":"This is inside the 5th St Arcade. Great breakfast.  Service was a little slow but everything is fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where to begin with this one. The passive aggressive hostess or the incompetence. Let's start by saying the food looked amazing and cooked right in front of the dining room which I'm a fan of all day.

Now let's get to the massive incompetence. The hostess is running around like a chicken with her head cut off. They take a list of names for the wait, again not a problem. But as people walk away in disgust, when there are open tables that sit for 15 or 20 minutes and then they still insist on calling those people on their cell phones before they will sit the next on the list. These people are long gone but they go down the whole list calling each one while everyone waiting sits like a shmuck staring at empty seats.

Then there were 2, 2 tops open and 3 single seats at the bar, so logic would say sit the 3 single people at the bar and the 2 people at the 2 top. Logic has no place here, it's like the Matrix, except without the cool side effects. So you guessed it, she sits the 2 people at the bar, leaving one lone stool that sits there for 15 minutes before she sits a single there...now the quandary. There are now just 2 singles one of them being me. Of course now they only have 2 tops left, so everyone that arrives after me with a party of 2 gets seated right away.

Once again I get that it's a small local business and the food looks awesome, hopefully I can try it one day. But they have to do something about the organization. Horrible and maybe put an extra person on when a huge event is in town.  I'm willing to give it another shot before I leave, and update the review, because I'm firm but fair...I hope they don't let me down.

UPDATE: ok so I went back this morning and the food is as ridiculous as it looked yesterday. The jalapeño flap Jacks are off the chain and the people were awesome. Sal the manager more then made up for my bad experience yesterday. I am a man of my word so I am reviewing based on my latest experience."}
{"text":"Really amazing biscuits and gravy- the homemade biscuit was perfection.  The breakfast burrito was pretty tasty- the flavor of the beef was really unique.  The service wasn't fantastic, and the bloody mary was bland, but the menu has a ton of great options- I'll be back."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast place I've been to in a long time. I knew I should've went to somewhere like IHOP or similar. The staff was beyond rude and the service was the worst! They would even let are party of 6 sit together. They claim that they only allow 5 per party!!!???? Also the menu is extremely small and they will not alter any dish they offer. I'll never come back or recommend this place. Go anywhere else except this place. The food was ok, but what does it matter if the entire service experience was extremely horrible. Denny's is a 5 star restaurant compared to this place. 
Editing this review: after are horrible experience , they told our friend who took all of us out for breakfast that they could put our whole order on one check because they split our party of 6 up??? So he had to have his card ran twice for one order. So ridiculous. I hope this place doesn't stay in business much longer. They're clearly not ready to run a restaurant"}
{"text":"Great little space for a restaurant. I ate breakfast there a couple of times when I recently visited Cleveland. It's about a 7-10 minute walk from the Westin. The pancakes are huge; I wish I'd only ordered one. I was surprised that they had Mexican Coca Cola, given that they're so far north. It's pretty common for places to carry it in Texas. I also liked that they had pure maple syrup. If/when I'm in Cleveland again, I'll make sure I stop by."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to an amazing breakfast. The staff was great and it was interesting to sit at the bar to watch them cook. I am a hash lover so I was excited for this variation. However the meat was fine but the potatoes were still raw. The shrimp and grits were ok but there was about a cup of sour cream on top which kinda ruined the dish. looked like it was busy enough they were struggling to keep up which was the issue."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in town!  This is my go-to place during the early morning hours after working the night shift.  The standard plate of Vietnamese sausage, two eggs, and hashbrown is simple yet packed full of flavors.  My favorite hashbrown is the shredded crispy griddled potatoes, but Jack Flaps hashbrown with cubed potatoes and assortment of roots is to die for!  The brunch classic is the benedict and this season's pumpkin eggs benedict is excellent.  The ham is cut to quarter inch thickness with premium grade.  I was on the fence about the pumpkin hollandaise sauce, but I ended wiping my plate clean of the pumpkin hollandaise."}
{"text":"So not good... I ordered the BLT Sammich which seemed like it was going to be awesome. Shows up to the table and... 2 slices of white toast, 2 slices of rubbery bacon and arugula. When the server came by she said the kitchen didn't bother to tell her they were out of tomatoes!!! So I got a BL.. then I said there isn't any mayo which the server replied it doesn't come with mayo... and I said I did read the menu and it clearly says mayo.. so she brought me a side of mayo for my toast and rubber bacon arugula sandwich. BAD!!!! What place serves a BLT when they are out of T? What place even allows that to go out to a customer? What place says something doesn't come with a dish when it's listed on the menu? To the servers credit she didn't charge me for it. 
Next.. the Bloody Mary is just tomato juice and cheap vodka...don't bother!
Last , for the wait time and overpriced hyped food you should NOT go here. If you want some mediocre overpriced bacon and crappy toast... it's for you!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/Decor: 5/5 

A cute brunch spot with limited seating, but homey feel and a nice chalkboard wall, so great aesthetic. 

Service: 3/5
It was pretty empty for a Saturday, at less than half capacity I thought it would be easy to flag down our server if necessary, but it was surprisingly difficult. The staff was mostly inattentive. Some of our food came out cold--how they managed to make a breakfast burrito cold on the inside and out is beyond me--and when we asked to have it heated, we were met with reluctance and a little disbelief that it was possible for our food to be cold. 

Food: 2/5
Around the table we had a couple of Breakfast Burritos, a Breakfast Banh Mi, and the Lemon Curd Pancakes. 

On the whole, everything that was served to us was lukewarm. Two of the breakfast burritos were downright cold on the inside which is really difficult to do. For whatever reason, they dont put their breakfast burritos in the oven before serving them so the cheese that is sprinkled on top is also cold and not melted. The flavoring of the meat was pretty good, but it's really hard to enjoy a cold breakfast when you were expecting a hot one. 

The Breakfast Banh Mi was probably the best out of the entrees ordered, but even then was just OK. Cleveland seems to have some obsession with Korean and Vietnamese food, but doesnt really execute it well and this was no exception. It was okay, nothing great. 

The pancakes were the biggest disappointment. For an establishment whose name is a play on \"Flap Jacks,\" I was expecting a decent pancake at the least. The pancakes were nothing special and honestly, were a little burnt. The lemon and berry topping was good, but couldnt save the pancakes themselves from having a really dry texture and burnt taste. And again, the pancakes were pretty cold. it seemed like they had been made earlier and just zapped in the microwave at low heat before being served to us. 


Definitely wouldnt come here again."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place... 

It has a lot of charm and definitely a hipster-vibe (not sure if that's a good or bad thing). However, the food just does not hit the mark and it's very expensive for what you get. Perhaps the prices reflect the fresh (and sometimes unusual) ingredients and the made-from-scratch fare. All those things sound great but the flavor is just not there. 

I've been there twice now and both times I've been very disappointed. The bright spot to most of their breakfast dishes is the root veggie hash. Sounds unusual to some (myself included) but it tastes great. But that's supposed to be the side with your breakfast entree.

In my two visits, my breakfast entree was the Biscuits & Gravy and Veggie Omelet. In defense of the restaurant, I didn't order flap jacks and Jack Flaps and, perhaps, that was my downfall. At any rate, both entrees were no bueno. 

Fool me once...blah blah blah...I won't be going back. Ironically, I overheard the people sitting next to me say the same thing on my last visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in about 10AM for breakfast as it was a short walk from our hotel.  We were seated very quickly but it took a while for the waitress to bring water and coffee though she was quite pleasant.  We ordered about 10:15 but at 11, we still did not have food.  We were growing quite anxious as we had not yet eaten and our waitress assured us that our food was on the way.  About 10 minutes later, our first breakfast arrived...our FIRST breakfast and though it was pancakes and we had 2 orders, we only got one.    About 10 minutes later, 2 more arrived but without the toast we ordered.    In 5 minutes, the last breakfast arrived, 15 minutes after the first one was served.   Quality of the food was ok though I thought with proper execution, it could have been very good.  Bacon was served nearly raw so we had to send that back.  We politely told our waitress that the meal was a disaster and she was very kind and apologized and told us that 2 people had called off that day and the kitchen was woefully understaffed.    Here is a suggestion for the next time it happens:  1.  Stop seating people/turn them away with a polite explanation.  This is breakfast, people are hungry and they don't want to wait an hour for their first meal of the day.  2.  If the meal has been a disaster, offer a discount.  If they have offered a discount, I would have felt much better about waiting for substandard food but instead, I laid out $50 for a breakfast that took way too long and was not properly made."}
{"text":"I love when I eat a vegan something and think the menu is lying to me. These vegan pancakes just changed my life. SO GOOD. The hash was pretty damn dope too. We got here right as they opened and that seems to be the way to go as it's filled up fast!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Family and I stumbled upon this place for late breakfast, it's small and popular so be flexible, but it is so worth the wait. We ordered burritos, which are huge and amazing (I'm from Texas, I have high standards) the quality of the food was great. Also ordered the Cinnamon Roll Eggy Bread, fun, clever alternative to the regular roll. Staff was great, atmosphere was perfect. You can easily come here for a solo coffee or bring a group. If you want to have a great kick off to your day, start here!!!"}
{"text":"I will title this review \"The Terrible Service That Replaced PJ's\". 
Let's make this short and sweet: after going there for our first time, excited to try something new, we have no desire to return to this wannabe-hipster establishment. Don't got me wrong, I love all things indie, but you can actually feel the strong lingering and forced desire this place is trying to sell itself as a \"hipster gourmet breakfast food-porn restaurant\". Here's a tip: you're trying too hard. 
Firstly, our food took five-ever to arrive. Not only that, why serve toast twenty minutes before our entrees arrive? I don't want no cold toast with my overpriced omelet!
And no, I don't want your tofu, soy, non-meat, organic, non-GMO, non-flavor (probably) bacon. Please for the love of god do not disgrace all that is bacon. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
I will admit, the food did look very nice, and taste fairly well, but a plate of two eggs should not cost $8.99 with a side of toast and this knock-off bacon. 
It's a shame PJ's was replaced with such terrible business. Things will never be the same. Let us take a moment of silence to remember PJ's and all of the beautiful people who made that place a wonderful and worthwhile diner experience."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for a girl's trip with my mom, and Jack Flaps was a perfect little brunch spot with delicious and interesting gluten free options!

Located in an adorable little arcade with several other shops.

I had the benedicto mexicano (gluten free) which was a delicious eggs benedict on jalapeno cornbread with chorizo gravy, crema and more - this dish was really interesting, yummy and had a great mix of flavors and textures.

My mom and I also split a yummy serving of GF buckwheat pancakes with bananas. The cinnamon butter they came with was AMAZING. Cinnamon butter for the win."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted a quick breakfast before leaving Cleveland. We were staying at the Hilton, so Jack Flaps was one of the closes restaurant near the hotel; Plus we all wanted to take a look at the Arcade Cleveland that is near the Jack Flaps. The service was pretty good. We got our food pretty quickly. I had the Tiramisu pan cakes, and they were huge!!!  You get two pieces, and they are about the size of the plate and are really thick. The pancakes were pretty good, but the cannoli pieces that was on top I can do without. I did have a major issue with the pancake (found a little piece of plastic), but the waitress did tell the kitchen staff and took the pancake off the bill. (She even took my coffee off the bill too which she didn't have to). I am hoping the kitchen staff would make some improvement to keep foreign objects from the food, and I would give this place a try again when I come to Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11am on a Saturday. The place was pretty busy. It was so busy that we had a 15 minute wait. But it was weird that there were several tables that were open. After 10 minutes we were seated at a table that was available the entire time. Person after person was told there was a 15-20 minute but tables were empty. I don't quite understand. You push people away because you can't hire a bus boy? Or your kitchen is backed up? Hire more people! You're obviously busy and making money."}
{"text":"Breakfast selection limited, but pretty decent. I really like the veggie hash browns. Nice treat."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry pancakes, pork belly bacon and scrambled eggs with cheese. I was expecting more strawberry flavor with the pancakes but it tasted like regular pancakes topped with cream and strawberries. It was still really good even though it wasn't quite what I expected. The bacon came out very overcooked but they kindly brought me a new order that was very delicious. And you can't go wrong with scrambled eggs with cheese. Even though I'm only in town a few days, I might have to come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Best food we had in Cleveland. Burrito was out of this world. Can't wait to go back to Cleveland just to go to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast joint! 

Having never been to the original I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.  I stopped in most recently on a Thursday afternoon for a weekday brunch with a work colleague. 

Service was a little slow but that's to be expected when the restaurant is so small there can really only be one waitress. 

Anyways onto the good - food was fantastic. I ordered the candied jalapeño pancakes - sweet with a subtle heat. My colleague ordered the shrimp and grits which unfortunately came with bacon in the creme-fraise, so vegetarians be ware. While the service was a little slow, our drinks were refilled quickly and our food came out piping hot. 

I will definetly be coming back for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"I have been to the original JF location before for breakfast and I enjoyed it so I figured I would try this new lunch spot in the east side of the Euclid-Prospect Arcade. 

The place is pretty small and is furnished with a good number of bar seats and two top tables. Probably not ideal for big groups if it gets busy, but it wasn't busy at all at noon on a Monday. 

I sat myself and a waitress followed me over to take my drink order. I ordered the Thai Boy which was a Po Boy sub on a massive white bun. Between the bread was lightly breaded Tumeric Thai Fish with Kimchi Slaw. The flavors were great. The dish was not spicy hot, but certainly well seasoned. When I ordered the waitress did a nice upsell and asked if I would like that with fries ($4).

I do like the fries here. They are flavorful and come with a pretty great homemade ketchup. My only negative is that they are so thin and small that picking them up is a challenge, let alone dipping them into the ketchup and managing to get them to hold a substantial amount of sauce. 

Also homemade is the hot sauce. The waitress brought this out to my friend who order the Breakfast Mac and Cheese. The Mac is served with two fried eggs on top. And bacon. Two ingredients that make anything delicious."}
{"text":"This place is perfect in every way. Came to Cleveland for the recent UFC fights and ate breakfast here both days I was in town. Wonderful food and great service."}
{"text":"The only server lady that is there is extremely rude. There were multiple tables available to sit but she kept saying there is a wait. People before us were leaving because she was so rude. I would never come here again because of her."}
{"text":"Poor little Jack Flaps is in a mall that is damn near empty. Def looks like the local frequent this place over us visitors.  Pancakes were rocking. The sausage amazing. They had an egg thing with chorizo my BFF just went to town with and cleaned her plate. Great coffee.  It was a nice stop."}
{"text":"This was a great find on a beautiful Sunday morning.  I got the big F'ing Breakfast Burrito. If it isn't spicy enough eat the fresh jalapeño garnish,  but most people don't. Lots of beef in this dish with wonderful flavor. My bride had the veggie omlette  and my son gave the thumbs up for the Vietnamese sausage.  Definitely worth a return visit to try the flaps and poti.ne."}
{"text":"It's a solid breakfast place in Cleveland, but is a bit price. I wish their drink portions were larger, but the food was so good! The oatmeal/fruit plate was absolutely delicious.  Sometimes they have a wait, but it is usually pretty easy to get a seat."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing. We came about an hour before they had to close and we still got top notch service! Our waitress was WONDERFUL - 12/10! She was so on top of it with our orders, making us laugh, and always checking on us to see if we were okay. Our party might've had a mega girl crush on her, but she seriously made our experience here that much memorable (seriously get her a raise!). 
Pancakes were amazing and happy hour was so worth it."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We happened to stumble upon this place while trying to find another, and we were happy we did. The 30 wait ended up being barely 10. I got the I'm just basic, and my boyfriend got the f'ing burrito, and we both practically licked our plates clean. Great service as well. We sat at the bar and our server was bar tending, serving tables outside the bar, and bussing, and she was still able to refill our drinks and get us our check in a timely manner. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while wandering through the 5th street arcades. I decided to stop in and eat breakfast because the place looked very popular. It took a little bit for any of the servers to notice me, so I did stand alone by the entrance for awhile as the place was very crowded. I ended up taking a seat at the bar. The menu is small but the food is delicious! I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was so yummy! The braised beef was so tender and spiced to perfection. I also ordered a single pancake and I'm so glad I did. It tasted like a fluffy snicker doodle!! If you happen to be in the downtown Cleveland area for breakfast, definitely give this place a shot. Just be aware of the slower service (servers weren't the most attentive) and a potential wait."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. We got the breakfast burrito and the Mexican Benedict. I'm giving it a 4 because it took so damn long to get service. I think we waited about 45 minutes total for our meal. But have to say it was pretty much worth it because we weren't in a hurry. It was a Saturday morning--"}
{"text":"Very HUGE pancakes lol. I decided to finally try this place this morning for breakfast (11/12/15), I keep hearing my co-workers talked about this establishment (why that word?). So at first as I was approaching it through the marketplace, I thought it was closed. The restaurant was dark...no lights? But besides that, people were inside...eating lol. I think there were only two people working, one in the kitchen and the other in the front. I don't know her name, actually I don't think she told me but nothing bad...super friendly. Hell even the cook was super friendly and came out from the back to strike up a natural conversation. Both were giving me suggestions on what's good and what I should order. I opted for the Lemon Curd Pancakes with Berries(sorry no picture). I wasn't too fond of the berries...super tart (or sour), to the point I made the ugly pucker face, but I liked the lemon curd cream with the pancakes (or flapjacks). Even though I only had two pancakes, they were some huge pancakes, maybe not worth $10 but whatever...indulge a little I guess. Actually I didn't even finish them, only could eat half. I was eyeing the burrito a customer was eating...maybe next time. Overall good customer service, dark environment...didn't agree with the pricing."}
