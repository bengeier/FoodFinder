{"text":"Don't be put off by the location (in a shopping plaza). The service has always been outstanding and the food was very good. We are repeat customers because we appreciate the way they treat their customers and have a big menu with lots for everyone. I have never been disappointed. I really can't say enough about the service- friendly and they go out of the way to make sure you are taken care of.  Everything we have ordered has been great!"}
{"text":"This diner was a disappointment.  The food was bad and it was too expensive. Not going back."}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast on a weekend, and we were seated without a wait. Our food came timely. Everything was great and our waitress was very friendly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came out of town to visit friends. The food is great and excellent service. The waitress was great and very friendly. The staff seems like they have alot of fun and very organized place to work. We will definitely come back when we are in town. Brittany was awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious make your own omelettes, strawberry French toast, and sausage gravy (we have eaten here multiple times). You definitely get your money's worth here with the size of portions and price. There's a huge selection to choose from. Has a small town diner feel once your inside - don't let the fact it's in a strip mall stop you from checking this place out. A great addition to Verona!"}
{"text":"Been there about 15 times now.never had a bad meal.i like going there for breakfast the most.prices are reasonable and staff are always nice."}
{"text":"80% full at lunch time, elderly retirees with the occasional blue collar guy in for some diner food. Place is clean and very well put together. The food is abysmal. I went with a recommendation - Cuban sandwich. No swiss cheese, wasn't griddled, quite dry and entirely flavorless. The coleslaw was among the worst I've ever had. The homemade chips, which the waitress raved over, were cold. A simple heat lamp would make them warm, even if they weren't fresh from the fryer. 

I feel a tinge of remorse for leaving a bad review -- the staff was incredibly friendly. 

But I am sympathetic to the Soup Nazi -- you can treat me like crap if your product is truly delightful. 

Definitely would not return. Rivertowne is 2 minutes away and what it lacks in cleanliness it more than makes up for in every single dish being tasty, well seasoned and very fresh."}
{"text":"Anyone in the monroville/Churchill/ Verona/ oakmont area should sooo come here for breakfast! I got the strawberry French toast and it was fabulous. It's really clean in here and the service is wonderful. We didn't wait long for our food. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not so small hole in the wall.  Great coffee.  Not enough room in this review to describe the different breakfast options: traditional & unique.  Very reasonably priced.

There are 3 locations ... worth going searching for ..."}
{"text":"Good and service were great. Like the menu choices. Would reccomend for lunch. Nice spot To go to."}
{"text":"The quality and service has really gone down hill since it opened. The bacon is soggy, the potatoes taste like they are from yesterday. When the server brought my food she told me that I cannot share with my 3 year old daughter. Then she brought the menu over to show me where it says no sharing. My daughter is 3 years old!!!!, she only eats 3 bits. WTF?"}
{"text":"I shared chicken and waffles and a pumpkin pie milkshake with a friend and both things were amazing. I've been to Freedom Square Diner several times and never had a bad experience! As with most diners, I wish their hours were less old fashioned."}
{"text":"Good home cooking with very friendly atmosphere. Seemed liked the wait staff knew everybody!"}
{"text":"Food and service were very good.  Loved the variety of pancakes and French toast.  Also liked the option to build your own omelet."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast and lunch place the waiters where very nice and the food was great"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time today when we were passing through the area. We were a little skeptical at first since it's in a shopping plaza and I was expecting a faux diner. Surprisingly, this place was really good. There were no problems with parking and no wait for a Saturday morning. Service was good and oldies were playing. My husband ordered the Steak Benedict (included home fries) and really liked it. It was definitely different and I've never seen this on any other diner menus. I got a make-your-own omelette (included home fries and toast). The omelette was delicious with bacon, American cheese, and mushrooms. We decided our 4 could be a 5 if it weren't for the prices (more pricey than most diners) and the home fries had more flavor. (They needed salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make them mediocre.) Overall, we had a good experience and would likely stop back when we pass through."}
{"text":"Don't be weary of the strip mall restaurant.  Sometimes, it is a hidden gem and that is what the Freedom Square Diner is.  The Diner is located in the same mall as the Verona Giant Eagle.  It is a way larger space than you think it is.  The decor is a little bland and boring, but that does not reflect what really matters:  The menu.  This menu offers decadent sweet, like a stack of french toast that looks like a piece of cake with fruit and some kind of frosting (if you have read my previous posts, I usually do savory for breakfast).  The menu also offers a variety of savory, like steak and eggs, country friend steak and my go to Corned beef hash and eggs.  (Which I did not get :)  I was feeling a little simple, just some scrambled eggs, some grits (another plus), and a few pieces of French toast.  This was one big meal for $8.99.  

Some pointers:  get there early, it seemed pretty busy when we left.  The place is big, but still.
Listen to all of the sides - there are a lot of choices
They have Mancini bread as an option for toast.

Just go there and make your own decision.  I am glad that we went there on my search for perfect breakfast.  We will definitely be back soon (On weekdays, they have a pick 5 for $5.  Checking that out this summer)

They are open all day, not just for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts!  If you have a sweet tooth, try the Strawberry Crunch French toast. It's delicious!  Thick french toast with strawberry cream fried in corn flakes.  The strawberry cheesecake pancakes were quite tasty too.  The omelets are made to order with your choice of ingredients, the bacon and fried potatoes are flavorful!  The space is bright and airy and the servers are very friendly.  Highly recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place!  We had a large group of 11 and they were able to accommodate all of us. Food was delicious. I had pulled pork and highly recommend it. Our total bill was $10 a person - super affordable."}
{"text":"Fantastic find!!! Our server Michelle was quick kind and super friendly! The steak Benedict was cooked perfectly! I didn't think I would have finished the whole thing but I couldn't stop once I stared! Even if you have to wait, hang in there it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast, even at lunchtime. Great food, really friendly caring staff. The perfect diner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple times for breakfast.  I have mixed feeling about this diner.  First time I stopped I found the food a little on the bland side and the second time the food was a lot better.  The staff were very nice, service was good, place was clean.  I'm giving three stars for now, but will try it out again in the future."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little diner that my husband and I frequent. The service is great, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious!! I would highly recommend this great little diner to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place. They specialize in breakfast and lunch, the meals that are often overlooked by other restaurants. The build your own omelettes are great. I don't know anyone who's had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today. Coffee was good, refills came quickly, food was soooo good. I had the peanut butter and banana French toast, my husband had the steak and eggs Benedict. We will be back. Great service, nice diner."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot besides Bob Evans. I love the Strawberry cheesecake pancakes, so good. You will not be able to eat it all. I had the French toast, scrambled eggs with cheese, turkey sauce, and bacon. All been good!"}
{"text":"Very happy they opened this location. Everything you could want from a family diner. Only open until 3, but they do carry dinner type items on the menu, like Liver with Bacon and onions."}
{"text":"I've been to Freedom Square several times for breakfast and it was better than I expected.  I'm not usually a big fan of omelettes made in omelette makers, but the one I had was better than average.  The prices are about average for what you could get at a similar location, especially good for carrying the overhead of shopping plaza rent.  The service is really good but the kitchen seems to have some timing issues.  There is always one thing about my meal that is off.  The eggs are hot but the cottage fries are cold.  The eggs are done perfectly but the hot sausage was chewy and tough.  On my last visit my eggs and hash brown were scalding hot but my waffle was so cold the butter didn't even melt at all.  That being said, I'm sure they are dealing with the challenges of a small kitchen and lack of adequate infrastructure.  So it was still better than a trip to Kings or Dennys."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast place.Our hostess, Haley, was so friendly and accomadating.Our waitress,Stacey, works so hard.Our coffee cup was never empty. She made some suggestions which met our expectations! My Eggs Benedict was so delicious.The hollandaise sauce was  very tasteful over poached egg and ham on an English muffin.This is the Best in the City.My sister's omelette was huge and and very flavor.The portions of every entree is money well spent! The place is very clean and pleasant
This is by far our favorite breakfast place.EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!@"}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend on a whim. My daughter got hungry at the dollar store nearby, and I figured we'd try this place. I am SO glad I did! 

They've got a real, small-town diner feel. As someone who recently moved here from a small southern town, that's great news for me. Everything from the leg lamp (who doesn't love a good Christmas movie reference?!) to the friendly greeter to the awesome waitress made this experience really special.

We both ordered chicken fingers. They came out quickly, and they were delicious. My mother joined us halfway through the meal and ordered pumpkin pie, warm and with \"twice the whipped cream you'd normally get.\" It was no problem at all. At the end of the meal, my daughter wanted another one of the cardboard sleighs the kids meal came in (which was a really nice touch). It was no problem. the waitress hopped off with a smile and came back with two clean ones. 

I'll definitely be going back. This was a really nice place, really nice food, and it's staffed by really nice people."}
{"text":"Good diner food, but not good for my dietary needs of gluten free vegetarian. It would be nice to have more options. The others in my group were happy with their food. Large portions"}
{"text":"Pleasant little diner with great diner food. Friendly waitstaff. Thinking about it makes me want second breakfast."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Freedom Square, which we found right here on Yelp.  There's plenty of seating, the place is nicely decorated and everything looks fresh and new, not old-diner shabby.  Even at 11 am on a Sunday, we were seated right away.  Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and helpful.  I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast on her recommendation, and my companion ordered the cinnamon French toast, so new he had to create his own combo.  Both came with delicious home fries that were obviously made fresh, not poured out of a frozen bag.  With such a nice atmosphere, good service and great food, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Nice variety of breakfast sweets and your expected breakfast items.  This place is a treat."}
{"text":"It is nice to have a diner option for breakfast in Oakmont/Verona area.  I have not tried anything beyond breakfast but the omelets are very good.  I cannot stand hash brown or frozen potatoes (they serve really decent potatoes with breakfast).  I had problem with an order and it was replaced immediately along with discount for next visit (which was nice but overkill - but appreciated)."}
{"text":"The strip mall location is deceiving; there are plenty of tables/booths to mix with the locals and get your fill o' venerable diner fare. It's not extraordinary, but you certainly will not leave hungry. With regard to breakfast basics, the omelettes are considerable and can be built to your own specs. The same can be said for their pancakes...epically enormous, especially the seasonal pumpkin 'cakes!  Typical sides, such as home fries, could use some more zest, but the \"meats\" (thanks, Arby's!) are on point.  Oh and go for the Mancini's bread when possible and thank me later.  Lunch will simply have to wait another day.  Nonetheless, the service experience has been consistent - friendly, attentive, and efficient. I believe there are two other locations around Pittsburgh, so check one out for a fair fill-in to the big chains."}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast a few weeks ago. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad. The venue and decor are typical of a diner in a small strip mall. After we were seated, our waitress came over quickly and took our orders. We both had the Hungryman Breakfast consisting of 2 eggs, breakfast meat, home fries, and 2 pancakes/waffles/French toast. I had cranberry juice and green tea and J had coffee. The service here is wonderful. Our waitress Ericka checked on us regularly, which was nice considering the restaurant was so busy. The breakfast meal that we had was very filling. The portions were large, so we ended up taking food home. Overall, everything was around $25, which made J happy."}
