{"text":"I'm surprised with all the 1-star reviews! But, you can't win over an experience when service is mediocre. Lucky for my party, our server was very attentive! We went on a Thursday, so maybe not the busiest day, but it was packed and there was a constant flow of diners for the hour and a half we were there, so they had at least 3 different servers to my knowledge which maybe sped things up a bit.  

We did have a tiny hiccup when we asked for our appetizer to come with our dinner, but it came out before.  That with our variety of bread (yes it's cold like some previous poster mentioned.... which is pretty typical.. no?) we had a bit of munching before the main course. The calamari was cooked really well. Hot, but not soggy or too oily. The batter was light and not overwhelming! I was really happy with it.

There were 3 of us and we shared the padella for 2. They were nice enough to bring out a separate bowl so we could divide things.  You get two bowls of linguine with a marinara sauce and tiny shrimp.  Then a giant bowl of seafood paella in a red soupy sauce. There was crab, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, and calamari. We finished it all, but the dish was plenty of food for 3 people!!!

Overall, really good food. We had good service. It was busy, which is a good sign in my opinion! Would go back for this dish, especially!!"}
{"text":"Only had one other table for dinner on a week night the whole time. 

We got bread at the beginning after ordering but it was cold and not toasted. 

Ordered the calamari for appetizer and the gnocchi for the main. I thought both was mediocre and the main was way too salty. I couldn't finish the whole dish in one sitting. 

Don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a nice quiet dinner at Ristorante Orsini on a Tuesday night. There were only 6 other people at 2 other tables but we didn't mind. We had a really nice dinner. We started with bruschetta and Caesar salad. We had the Linguine al Gambero and veal parmigiana for our mains. We finished with coffee and tiramisu which I really, really enjoyed. The service and ambiance were excellent. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food good people friendly service.  Worth a visit.   Pasta of course is great they are Italian."}
{"text":"First visit to Orsini and I have to say it was a disappointment. Bruschetta was decent, but at $4 per two small half slices (per person) , definitely not worth it. I ordered the gnocchi with basil gorgonzola sauce. The gnocchi was very overcooked and gummy. The sauce was pasty and tasted like flour, like they did not fully cook the flour out in the roux. Combine floury sauce and gummy gnocchi, and you paste stuck to the top of your mouth. If that wasn't enough, service is also very slow. Totally not worth the money they charge here."}
{"text":"On vacation visiting family we visited twice in 10 days. Our experience was very good. They seem to have a goon number of regulars, always a good indicator. Service was efficient, food got and well presented with everyone happy with the quality & quantity. Friendly and responsive to younger diners who are a little fussy - rapid \"no problem \" to each request. Love the minimalist but effective decor. Spotless washrooms. 
Overall a solid value nice place to dine."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, and the atmosphere felt like a cruise ship dining hall. Not to mention the prices are not good for what you get."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for dinner and we had the mussels, salad, different pasta dishes. Everything that was ordered was delicious. I would recommend and would definitely be returning. Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Four of us went for Lunch and we spent most of our time waiting for the waitress to acknowledge us! (They definitely needed more than one server)! 
During this time we experienced a very bad odour coming through the vents which made our eating experience not very enjoyable!
The food was adequate, unfortunately one of the plates was returned as we found a hair in the middle of the salad.   We did not complain but only mentioned it to waitress .., Sadly, the waitress only apologized, returned it, nobody bothered to compensate us. No brainer! Poor customer service -  We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Decor is nice inside and the restaurant was busy so I was hopeful for a great dinner. Unfortunately, there was only 2 waiters and 1 bus person so service was very slow. We waited over an hour for our appetizer and it only came after we enquired about it. The fried calamari was over fried, a little on the burnt side. Our seafood pasta came 20 mins later and was over cooked - tough and chewy. The mussels didn't taste very fresh and I ended up paying for it throughout the night."}
