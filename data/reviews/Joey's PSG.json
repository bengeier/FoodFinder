{"text":"Our office of 5 people went to Joeys for lunch today. Everything looked so good, we had a hard time choosing. We decided to order the house made chips and 3 orders of homemade meatballs as an appetizer. Both were delicious ! 
We decided to order the large pizza with cheese, pepperoni and sausage. The dough is fresh made daily, pizza sauce was just right, toppings were well proportioned to the size of large pizza. The pizza crust verged on being a little to done for my liking, but no one else mentioned it. 
Joey came over and personally thanked us for coming in. Please patronize this new establishment and support local business! The construction on Main St &  Stapley is hurting people finding this great place!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the pizza here! Just as good as what we got in Italy. Joey came out to talk to us today. Super nice guy from a big Italian family just like me. We could have talked for hours about his amazing ingredients and how he puts it all together. No Americanized version of pizza or cannoli here. Liquor license just approved. Don't let the light rail construction discourage you, easy to get in and out if. This will become our go-to place."}
{"text":"I had Joeys pizza and is was delicious .  I also shared a Hot Momma sandwich which was very good"}
{"text":"There's a new pizza (and soup and grilled cheese!) joint in town!  Everything we've had here is so delicious! The pizza dough is hand-tossed, and the crust is the perfect thickness, a great blend of chewy and crispy. I highly recommend the VP sandwich, the minestrone soup, the cheese balls (OMG!). I love that it's a family friendly restaurant, and that kids' meals come with carrots and celery. Try it! You won't be disappointed!  We didn't save room for their excellent desserts, so we'll just have to go again!"}
{"text":"Definitely among the very best mom & pop pizzerias in the Vallley.  The crust, in particular, is true Italian quality.

Has a decent kids meal as well - its obvious a good bit of of time, and likely a lot of cash, went into the design & decor, as well as the menu.

Hopefully they weather the light-rail storm, would like this to be around for awhile."}
{"text":"This is just really good pizza. The crust especially is fantastic. It is crispy but chewy. The service is also fantastic. The girl who took our order gave us great service and was very welcoming and upbeat. I love that you can see into the kitchen, which is very clean. The interior is really clean and makes good use of the space. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. Everything tasted fresh. Lots of toppings. Love the dough. Only hiccup in the order was the ingredients. Ordered half Joey special / half pepperoni sausage. Looks like it was an error of the hostess, the receipt showed onions instead of mushrooms. Refusing to dock any stars though because the food was so good. Would love to come back and try the joey special as is."}
{"text":"Great Service. Real good Pizza. I place them in my top 3 in AZ with venzia's, and s'barros. Very NY style, My Wife's from PA, and we have had NY pizza and this place was definitely on point. Don't let the light rail construction de-rail your visit. Nice interior and the people running the place are very nice.  We finished off a pizza and were Happy and full. We will come again! bout time AZ started getting some great places for Pizza. Want to go back and try a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Wow!! This was amazing. Walked in and planned on getting a pizza but was amazed by the Grilled Cheese menu. My son and I both got the Hot Mama grilled cheese  and the Tomato Basil Soup!  Best tomato basil soup I have ever had!! Joey's mom taught him how to make that soup when he was 9 years old."}
{"text":"started with a side salad.  Fresh greens, heirloom tomatoes, fresh made croutons and house dressing. So fresh.  Next was cheese balls omg. My husband described them as \"a cheese stick that went to heaven and came back as an angel\".  Fresh made marinara to dip in.  We then shared the Hawaii pizza and the vp sandwich.  The pizza was write good but that sandwich was a gift from the sandwich gods. So very amazing!!! No room for dessert this time around but we will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, outstanding grilled cheese sandwich, tasty pizza - we'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch after seeing an advertisement on my work intranet. Enjoyed it very much! I had the The JW which was Italian sausage, mozzarella, and marinara on an Italian roll that was pressed like a grilled cheese. Making it grilled cheese style gave the bread a welcome crunch. It came with a pickle and homemade potato chips that are like a thin style waffle cut. A restaurant I used to work at used to call them gaufrette.  Had a cannoli for desert. All was great! Definitely will go back regardless of the light rail construction."}
{"text":"Once we got past the street construction, we ordered the cheese balls and the Italian sandwich. Everything was very flavorful and delicious! The chips are fantastic. It was plenty for my mom and I to share for lunch. We'll definitely be back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time eating there and both times I've had a great experience!  The chef and the server were both friendly and helpful.  The pizza was great and the grilled cheese with prosciutto and fig preserves and a side of house made potato chips was even better!  Don't let the construction keep you away.  And, take N. Matlock St. between University and Main to avoid the construction all together."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends and decided to drive and try it out. Glad I did! Had some great pizza, although that was all I tried on the menu. From the comments from the other diners around me, all the other food was great as well!"}
{"text":"Hey errrrbody,

It is hard to find a new and REALLY Good place in Mesa to eat. I went to this establishment this evening and was sincerely impressed with 3 things that I consider to make up a good dining experience:
Quality Food: This establishment homemade 95% of its menu and everything I ate was delicious. I sincerely did not eat an item on the menu that disappointed. It was fresh and was high quality ingredients. No processed foods that came from a bag or a can.
Customer Service: Prompt, attentive and sincere. And they always kept my water glass full.... kind of a biggy to me. They were also very knowledgeable about their menu and ingredients. 
Making it a Memory: The glass casing allows you to view the making of all the food, it allows the experience to be a bit more personable when you get to actually watch your meal being made. The owner(Joey) came to the table to ask about the meal but also to express his gratitude for us coming. He also told the history of him and his dream to open the restaurant. He ultimately made it, not just another date night.... it now will be a memory. Not a night that gets lost in the same old dining experience that is lack luster service, half hearted prepared meals and a nonchalant hostess or owner that only cares for the quickest sit down and then get out mentality. 

I highly recommend this spot to all. It's hard to locate because of all the construction on Main but, to say it's a diamond in the rough does it a disservice. Find it, go in and enjoy. Your welcome."}
{"text":"The Gobbler sandwich is excellent. I will come here again.

Chef Joey specializes in a true New York Style Pizza in Mesa. He makes the dough as well as the pizza sauce using fresh tomatoes and imported Mozzarella cheese.

His artisan Grilled cheese sandwiches, many with meat, are all grilled on the flattop and served with house made potato chips that have our own special seasoning blend. 

Joey's soups are always made from scratch and the bowls are served with a hot soft pretzel stick.

I want to try all their Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great pizza & sandwiches and the service was the BOMB!!! Everything is made from scratch!!! Cheesecake is AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good meal, the server was super friendly and the owner and Chef came out and introduced himself. That is one of the reasons I am happy I stopped by, I love supporting mom and pop businesses, the food takes a little longer than most places to cook, but it's not a bad thing because they're actually preparing it, it's not coming off an assembly line like fast food chains. The chips that came with my sandwich, were  softer than I thought they would be in a good way, and they didn't hurt my teeth to chew them. The chips were delicious. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with macaroni cheese inside, it was good, yet next time I will stick to a regular grilled cheese sandwich. I got a cup of the Tomato soup, which was good too. Nice staff, nice place, you can see directly into the cook/chef area as you walk inside."}
{"text":"Don't let the construction on the street deter you!

Love this place! My husband and I have been here twice now and both the service and food have been excellent. Try the cheeseballs!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere. The tomato basil soup was very good. The cheese balls were excellent. Pizza was great with a very tasty homemade dough. The potato chips, which are also homemade, were excellent. The JW sandwich was really great. Tasty Italian sausage with loads of provolone and mozzarella cheese on grilled Italian bread. Great decor in the restaurant. Was definitely worth the drive from the west side to enjoy a great lunch. Will make that trip again soon."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. I had the VP and it was delicious. Everyone I was with loved there food. Pizza was on point. The grilled cheese was amazing."}
{"text":"Super great pizza here, some of the best In the Mesa area, Joey is super. cool and very much a food lover and creator of great foods, go here and eat, they have a bar now too, yeah the current road construction out front is a drag, but it is worth it to go here and eat!!"}
{"text":"Excellant!  Yelp wants more info- Ditto to the other positive reviews.  And the Men bathroom was clean :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza, too bad the light rail construction forced the closure but I'm sure they'll pop up again somewhere here in the valley"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had, and the chips were better than average too. This is a great little shop that's going into the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere.  The only bad thing is the light rail construction.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is just the find of place Mesa needs more of.   Good Fresh food made on the premises with  quality ingredients.  I want to go back and try some more items on the menu but I couldn't resist the pizza.  Both  the pizza and salad were very good.  The place is very clean and for now it's very uncrowned.  The light rail construction is really hammering these poor people trying to make a go of a nice place.   Go support them now while hardly anyone is there.  Once the light rail is done and more people discover it you may need to wait in line to get in."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite pizza places in Mesa! Always good service and a reasonable price. Ivy was our server tonight. She was friendly and helpful for our entire visit. The kitchen is visible so you can watch the pizza dough get tossed and your pizza get made. We tried a pepperoni and pulled Italian sausage tonight. Super yummy! Husband says they have the best crust ever."}
{"text":"Italian grilled cheese was awesome! And the house made chips were delicious.  Went on a Thursday during lunch and it was pretty quiet, but I'm willing to bet that is because of light rail construction. Don't let that fool you... access to the restaurant is still very easy regardless of whether you are traveling east or west on main st. plenty of parking in the parking lot too.  Service was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great owner and staff. Had the grilled cheese, fried cheese balls,and carrot cake. Next time will try the pizza.the whole menu looks great"}
{"text":"Best pizza since I left NY! I am a regular and love their sandwiches as well! Joe always comes and asks how you liked it and this place is a hidden gem in our community! Prices are fair and parking is never a problem .... let's hope the city finishes the messy lite rail construction SOON!"}
{"text":"A lot of construction in the area is affecting business. Highly encourage you to come and support this business as the pizza is worth the trip. Menu has some items I want to come back for like the grilled cheese and mozzarella deep fried balls. I ordered Joey's Special which comes with pepperoni, Italian sausage, black olives, mushroom and red sauce. Pizza was fresh and piping hot, just the way I like my pizza. I also tried the carrot cake. It was awesome. Service was great. Hostess seated me right away and waitress took my order as soon as I was seated. Will come back to try the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place closed down so we're on the hunt for a new favorite. This was a huge disappointment. It was mid-afternoon. We had called in for a pickup order. No one was there but employees. The girl helping us admitted that it was an unusually slow day. Got home with it pizza & it was burnt. Black on the bottom. It had real potential, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review I got my usual Mainland Hawaiian consistently excellent and I tried the JL and it's really good full of flavor everything tastes fresh and I got another Meathead and it tasted just as good as the one before only with more meat and what made it even taste better it was comped, thanks Joey, I will definitely be back, honestly I still would have come back even if nothing happened with the sandwich because I really like the pizza. One more thing I haven't tried it but that mushroom soup on the menu looks good I hope that you bring it back or serve it on a more regular basis so I can give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We love pizza, but we're usually disappointed when we try a new place. This was an exception to that for sure!  My wife got the baked mac & cheese. Awesome!  The pizza was great. It's got a great crust with a little crunch and chew to it. The location is a little out of our way, but to totally worth going to."}
{"text":"Love this place! Must try the Hot Mamma grilled cheese, and the potato chips are to die for."}
