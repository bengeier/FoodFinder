{"text":"Great food and Incredibly friendly service! Wonderful small town feel. I would eat here everyday if I lived around here. It is \"cash only\" but there is an ATM right next door. I would give this place 6 stars if I could! :) Oh and I forgot I mention.... The prices were great!"}
{"text":"Good hot food and good low prices! Chicken samiches are goooood! You get soup, entr√©e AND RICE PUDDING! Yum, wait! Maybe I shouldn't be telling anyone about this place."}
{"text":"Have eaten there under both names at least once a month for a meeting. Nothing to write home about. Simply okay food if you don't want anything other than breakfast  I have ran the menu and nothing to brag about. Service is fair to good.  Atmosphere is typical diner style.  I would compare to Denny's or maybe a little better."}
{"text":"Just wanted a light dinner and was very pleased. They have a 1/2 sandwich special with two sides for $4.99. Besides the 1/2 Rueben and the potato salad that is pictured, I also had a cup of creamy rice chicken soup that was nice and hot and good!
This is one of the BEST light meals I have ever had! The service was also very good and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The old Farmer Boy Restaurant is now Amherst Diner. At first glance it's the same place but with a few differences. The portions are really good sized, especially the home fries. They have specials during the week and even a Saturday kids eat for $0.99. The staff is really friendly and attentive to needs like condiments and beverage refills. The price is pretty topical for a family restaurant. Make a day of it on a Wednesday or Saturday and head over to Jamie's Flea Market after your meal like us."}
{"text":"Amherst Diner is a pretty nice place to stop in for a meal. The food is good and the prices are not that bad. The wait staff is also pretty good.

I recently took a coworker who lives on the far side of Cleveland here for lunch and he said he wished he lived out here so he could go to the Amherst Diner more often."}
{"text":"Stopped here after going to Jamie's flea market. Got the  Ruben plater.  And the river chicken sandwich . Omg it was so good. The sampled basket was really good and more then enough for everyone .  The soups are really good"}
{"text":"It will always be Farmer Boy (previous name) to our family.  However nothing has really changed.  Excellent portion sizes at a very reasonable price.  Food quality is always great."}
{"text":"We were trying to go to \"Farmer Boy's\" for breakfast, but this restaurant showed up in its location. I'm guessing they are one and the same. 

Solid diner pretty much in the middle of nowhere. You're probably stopping by here because it is one of the few restaurants surrounding the apple picking orchard. Cheap food, good portions, and quality is fine. Standard fare. Nothing special about the place, but it was clean and service was good."}
{"text":"Nice place, been eating  here for decades because I live nearby. Food is always good and the waitresses are great! Always feel at home."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much from the outside or inside.  Now let's talk about food.  All our food was great based on taste, amount and price!  I had a 10 oz stake, baked potato, salad and desert for $8.79!  There were three ladies with me and two of them took half there meal home because the portions were so large.  The staff was super friendly, fast and professional.  Don't judge a book by its cover and go try their food!"}
