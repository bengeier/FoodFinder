{"text":"We went there twice: once for all you can eat, and once for a la carte menu.  The salmon and shrimp teriyaki from the a la carte menu was delicous but pricey.  
The all you can eat experience was more like 'you get to eat all they are willing to bring you'.  50% of our food did not arrive, even after ordering twice.  The salmon belly, saba, etc. never arrived. I guess they prefer not delivering the more expensive dishes? We also found the portions to be way too big for all you can eat.  The chicken karrage was bland and chewy.  We were not sure what we were eating.  The spring roll was mostly pastry batter with little shreds of filling inside.  The chicken udon had lots of fatty chicken in it.  At $26-28 per person, we will not be going back for the all you can eat."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch twice in the last two months. 

The location is convenient but the place was exactly food court style ..please don't think you could do \" business connection\" here because unless you have the ability to scream above the crowd, 

Service was average to non attentive depending on which server you evade down. The male server seems yo have a bit of \"this is lunch hour and I am busy\" type attitude. Try the younger servers who tried to help but looked overwhelmed with the busy Bay Street customers. 

We ordered two sushi dishes and they were average, because of the demand of the lunch hours they literally gave us the bill without asking whether we wanted dessert. They wanted their table back. 

So I would rather have sushi in the TD centre food court for 1/2 the price and have a similar experience. Someone better think about opening a decent sushi place with better service (Ki has great service but ridiculous prices )"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early sushi dinner. Was $23. I thought the all you can eat price was great, especially for what you can get, including sashimi. I had some tempura that was very good (especially the shrimp, the squid was fair); and then had an assortment of nigiri and rolls. I think for the price, this is a good value compared to other sushi I have eaten at restaurants in Toronto. The service was very fast and everything was good. Ask for the regular menu so you can figure out what the rolls actually are!"}
{"text":"The place may be nice, however the food isn't that great; adequate at best. The sushi feels like it is something you would buy from Walmart.

Instead of the paper orders, or iPad orders, they take your orders like they would at a regular restaurant, which would be fine, if it wasn't an AYCE.

There's also fruit flies flying everywhere, which makes me question a bit as to how sanitary the place may really be. 

This restaurant, I find, does not really offer much variety and is not something I would be returning to."}
{"text":"Today I joined the Bay St. rat race for lunch at Ninki. I had the Bento Box A with salmon, and I left full, as did my wallet. Everything was fresh and tasty, so I have no complaints. Service was a bit rushed (the waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything else before plonking the bill down on our table) - but I guess the Bay St. crowd doesn't usually dawdle over lunch.

I'd prefer to dine at Ninki rather than battle the crowd in the food court - you get better quality food at pretty much the same price. It was easy to make a reservation for 12pm the day before, and within minutes of noon, the place was crammed with diners, so I'd say make a reservation if you want to be ensured a seat (though I did see quite a few walk-ins get seated relatively quickly)."}
{"text":"The food is always good. I've been there twice now. and both times the regular menu and the special menu items from the lunch menu were good. The bento box was good too."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with co-workers for all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Japanese food and this place was empty! Not surprised since the financial district resembles a donut once it hits 5PM. A different story at lunch though, since most of the suits come here for lunch. It's good that it's empty during dinner time, the service is attentive and your order will not get screwed up. 

The sashimi quality is really good. Better than most AYCE Japanese restaurants I've been to. The salmon really stood out, you get hunks of fresh tasting salmon meat. The sushi/maki rolls may not out number other places but they have the usual suspects, like the spider roll, rainbow roll, red dragon roll and california roll. They have some unusual ones like the beef and cheese roll, chicken pineapple maki and the pine nut roll. But we were not adventurous enough to try it. Their seafood miso soup was good. You actually get real seafood in there, a clam, shrimp and squid. Tempura was good as well. Actually everything we ordered was good.

They only offer all you can eat at dinner time. For it's quality and attentive service it's worth the visit here."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service - I went to the take out counter, the guy was super rude to me because I wanted to place a order for 2 rolls he didn't have already made then waited 20 minutes and then he charged me extra for miso soup.  Bullshit.  Food is cheaply made, fast food Japanese, and overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm happy to read the AYCE reviews because I've only been here for a quick lunch.  The bento boxes are a decent value for being on the PATH when you consider you will spend $10 for a greasy food court meal.

Quality is very good and service is quick although perhaps rushed.  I would recommend this location and the sister location on Adelaide for those looking for sushi pre-ACC events or enjoying 45 minutes with those stuck in the Bay St rat race.  Great quality but yes you will pay a bit more than Queen or Bloor West."}
{"text":"The environment is nice and cozy.  We have a seat inside the restaurant and at the same time enjoy seeing the crowd through the glossy glass wall.  I always like to try this restaurant as I pass by so many times.  The restaurant is definitely for the office workers.  At night there aren't that many people.  It offers free parking at night.

We order assorted tempura, green dragon and a bento box.  The sushi is fresh and colorful.  The Tempura is not too oily. It has the right portion for lunch. The waitress is very attentive.

This restaurant is one of those that can be chosen to meet friends at lunch."}
{"text":"Ok. You have to realize something about this place. It's in the PATH and you need to keep your expectations down. If you are looking for a decent/sub-decent Japanese food for a sit down in the PATH, this place is not bad. But if you are looking for really good sushi restaurant, try not to stay in the PATH. Lunch it's crowded and loud, but what do you expect? For dinner, it's actually quiet and they have all you can eat buffet, which isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Lunch is soooo crowded and noisy. If you arrive after 12pm there will be a long lane!! I ordered pork ramen but it seems that they forgot to add salt@@ anyway, the serving is fine!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Loud. 

My colleague and I shouted at each other for the whole lunch. The food was average but it seems that many of the folks who work here are real Japanese people.

If you have a reservation, there is a nice, quieter section on the 'patio' which is really a see through wooden lattice separating some tables from the madding crowd.

What I did like was the fast, friendly service and the Yama Moto Yama tea. Something that was slightly annoying was that my colleague had to go up to pay because their other machines were in use. A mild inconvenience to an otherwise standard Toronto lunch. 

I won't miss this place if it goes away but it is a fixture for now in Scotia Plaza."}
{"text":"I am always suspicious of so-called Japanese cuisine restaurants that offer all you can eat sushi. But on this Thursday evening in the financial district we decided to go there for dinner. It was around 8:30 p.m. and the restaurant was ready to close. However, the staff agreed to serve us.

The wait staf was very polite and our's was Japanese in Canada on working holiday. She made our otherwise lackluster experience enjoyable.

We chose both a la carte dishes and all-you-can-eat. The truth is neither was too good. Maybe they were ready to close and should have not accepted us in but the food was as basic as it gets. I am used to sushi places that wow me and this was not one of them. The fish cuts were very small, rice too cold and not seasoned very well. The rolls were better than the sushi pieces. 

The decor and embience of this restaurant is pretty good. It is also superbly convenient if you are in the financial district. Overall this would be a 2-star rating if it were not for the supre-friendly waitress we had. She was a joy to talk to."}
{"text":"It's located inside the PATH underground system and underneath the Scotia Plaza(Financial District), no it's not a high end sushi place by any means.

It's an all you can eat quality restaurant and I believe they serve all you can eat dinners. This place can very busy during lunch as its underneath the downtown core with all the office towers nearby.

We always get the bento boxes which are big in portions.  Sashimi pieces look and taste fresh.  Miso soup needs a little more flavour.  I have also tried their chirashi which is pretty decent as well.

The one thing I don't like is that they charge $2.75 for tea which should be free.

Overall decent quality, reasonable price for a downtown core restaurant.  Will satisfy most sushi cravers.

Note: this place gets loud during lunch, not a place to do any kind of business or conversation."}
{"text":"We were served by about 5 different people.  They were unable to tell us what the rolls were once they were on the plate, did not bring many of the items we wanted, and ignored requests.

The food was nothing special, it wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  I found it expensive for what we got, and only one server in the whole restaurant was helpful.

When we asked about a menu item another table had ordered off the regular menu we were told \"you can't have that it's regular menu\"...either they won't let you order off the regular menu as well, or they are really dense.

We won't be back."}

Ninki is hidden away in the PATH under King Street West. I happened to find this place while trying to desperately find an exit from the underground world of Toronto. It first caught my eye because it was very roomy, bright and clean inside. It is a little pricy for a AYCE place, but if you take a look at the menu there are lots of sashimi options so I personally feel like it's kind of worth it. Plus Ninki is more so known as a regular Japanese restaurant than AYCE so that might be a reason why it's more expensive (better quality).

Odered: SALMON/TAI/SABA/HOKKIGAI & SALMON NIGIRI/SPICY SALMON/ UNAGI SUSHI & SEAWEED SALAD 

All the food did take a little longer than usual AYCE places but I took it as a good thing because that means they are made fresh. Given the price, there are more choices of sashimi than usual on the menu. You order them by individual pieces and they were all decent size. If you like Tai, Saba or Hokkigai sashimi they are worth trying but it was nothing special. Salmon sashimi was def the best choice, they were fresh and butterly in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend Spicy salmon nigiri because it didn't have much flavor but Unagi sushi was delicious. 

Ordered: SPICY CHOPPED SCALLOP & DYNAMITE RAINBOW & SPICY SALMON & GIANT SHRIMP CRUNCH ROLL 

There are 28 different types of rolls avail on the menu plus I went on a friday so there were extra 3 special rolls on the list. Spicy chopped scallop was actually very good- I wasn't expecting very much because spicy salmon nigiri wasn't that good but this one had more flavor and they didn't skimp out on chopped scallops so that was def worth getting it. Dynamite rainbow roll sounded good but it was kind of dry, could have used some more mayo. Spicy salmon roll tasted exactly like the spicy salmon nigiri I didn't enjoy them that much. Because I was paying 2 dollars more due to the fact that it was Friday- I decided to try one of the special rolls, giant shrimp crunch roll. This was basically a giant shrimp roll with tempura bits and mayo on top. It had no flavor but the only reason I sort of enjoyed it was because I just love shrimp.

Ordered: YAKI UDON

I didn't actually order this, my sister did. I had one bite and it was ok- lots of veggies in this dish and its teriyaki sauce so I think anyone can enjoy it.

Ordered: TONKATSU, CHICKEN KARRAGE, SHRIMP TEMPURA

All the hot food comes as soon as you order them, I am assuming these are premade. Tonkatsu was crispy and it was warm, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was hot. Shrimp tempura was big in size, but it had too much batter and I couldn't really taste the shrimp. Chicken karrage was the worst, it was just warm and had no flavor whatsoever. It would have been better served with japanese mayo or some kind of sauce.

Ordered: BANANA TEMPURA WITH VANILLA ICECREAM

This was so good! I love banana tempura with vanilla icecream and my sister and I got so excited when we saw this on the menu. It was so much better than I expected it to be. They pre-cut banana into small pieces before deep frying them so they were all nicely battered. I enjoyed every bite of this dessert and just thinking about it right now makes me drool!

SUMMARY: So far it's the best sushi place I've been to in Toronto (but then again I've only been to 3 so far so that's not saying much). The only thing I didn't like about this place is that they automatically charge you 15% gratuity but then I always just pay 15% anyways (but I just don't want to be forced by the restaurant). I would go back to Ninki again even if I just wanted Sushi."}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi on Tuesday night is terrible. The sashimi tastes frozen, the sushi is supremely average. I've been here a bunch of times because it's conveniently located in the PATH system near the Scotia Bank, but I wouldn't go here except for the convenience. You can get better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"avoid ordering the Ramen noodles here...totally disappointed and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Can't quite figure out if I just spent fifteen bucks for a bowl of best instant noodles or worst ramen..."}
{"text":"Hovered between giving this place one or two stars, but given quality of food, value, service, environment... yup. One star. 

Reserved a couple of days ago and came here for lunch with 5 others. Wow - it's loud. So noisy it was impossible to have a conversation at a table for 6. I think my ears are still ringing upon my return to the cube farm. It was very busy, with line-ups waiting for a seat. Given what I experienced, I am convinced this is more about the location than the food. 

I had the salmon set - meh. Salmon was watery and lacked any sort of flavour. Mayo was slopped onto the ?spicy? salmon maki as if it was a weak afterthought. No hint of spice at all. Sushi rice was wetter than it should have been, leading to chewy seaweed at the end of the meal. 

My co-workers received a bento box with missing California rolls. Wait staff was not attentive, and it took a while to flag them down for the missing items. We would have liked another pot of tea but it would have been too much of a pain to try to flag them down again. I really felt their goal was just to get as many people in as possible, screw the service. 

I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"I've worked within the PATH for about a year now. It was only recently that I finally decided to try Ninki. I was hesitant before because I'm quite picky when it comes to Japanese food. 

I came here with a bunch of coworkers and I was definitely surprised. I thought the prices for one we're going to be out of the roof because of the location but surprisingly they are reasonable. 

The first time I ordered the chirashi don, there was a lot of sashimi but the cut was a little too thick for my liking. 

I also went today, and because I'm watching what I'm eating lately I decided to try a cooked item. I had the teriyaki tuna. I was definitely not blow away, I really want sure if my cooked tuna was chicken or tuna. I had also asked the server to sub my white rice for brown and I still go white rice. 

So to sum it up. 

What I like:
Location
Fast service
Not too heavy
Moderate prices 
Taste of food is good 

What could be improved: 
The location is too cramped and noisy 
They don't allow seperate bills forage groups
The staff doesn't speak or understand English well
The washroom is not located in the restaurant but outside in the path


So, overall it's a decent sit down Japanese restaurant in the path but I would only go here during business days and business hours. It definitely caters to those individuals who are less sushi snobs than I am :)"}
{"text":"I think the only thing this place has going for them is that they are in the path. 

So I have come here a few times just because it's right there but my coworkers have gotten sick from the cooked food here before. Luckily if I am going to a sushi joint I'm having raw fish. We came here for a farewell, and made reservations. We still had to wait which isn't that outlandish considering it was prime time and in the core but we were asked multiple times by a really rude waitress to move to the side and we were all but becoming one with the wall. 

When we were finally seated I ordered a pint of the Sapporo Black and chirashi don. This place does it with some mayo which is kind of weird for me. The sushi rice was not soft enough, not sure if they put enough rice vinegar in their sushi rice but something was lacking. The fish was nothing superb similar in quality as a fast food sushi joint. Surprised I got two pieces of Tuna as it is a pricier fish. Paid $17 for the chirashi. The service was slow and even with a lot of arm flailing I couldn't flag down the waitresses. 

Would not come here again. You're better off grabbing sushi from the food court."}
{"text":"Worst.. WORST sushi restaurant in all of Toronto, hands down, and that's saying something because I not only eat at a lot of them, I have eaten some pretty questionable food from them.

The place is run by Chinese folk, trying to do Japanese food. Now you're going to think I'm a stereotypical racist for saying that, but I've found in my experience dining out that Chinese people don't know how to do Japanese food because they're always trying to mix mayonnaise and all this other disgusting crap into something that is supposed to be clean eating, raw, healthy and delicious just as-is.

Chinese food is full of oil (most of the time), deep-fried, covered in sauces, and masking the flavour of the ingredients. Japanese cuisine is the opposite to me, with a few exceptions of having tempura and so on.

Chinese people who run Japanese restaurants are also always trying to find way to use up all the waste (salmon bits) and cut corners, which I half admire as someone who doesn't like to let things go to waste, but am not willing to pay $15 for, considering it is not what I wanted.

I ordered the Chirashi Don and got this disgusting mess of leftover salmon bits mixed with salmon roe, into a big vat of MAYONNAISE, dumped on top of my plate like I am in the middle of some Cultural Revolutionary mix between American-Chinese-and-Japanese cuisine upheaval.

YUCK. DISGUSTING.

To top it off, I asked for NO FAKE CRAB (yuck), and I got half of it as fake crab, and the fish was thin, few, and far between.

Never coming back here. What a waste of my money. I feel sick that I paid that price for such disgusting food.

If you want real Japanese food, go to Japango by Dundas and Bay. Run by Japanese folk, you get Japanese service and the food is just.. beyond excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service!

I passed by this place on a daily basis when commuting to work, so today I decided to walk in and ask for a ramen menu since the big banner outside looked extremely delicious.

The waitresses seemed friendly when they handed me the menu but I heard her say \"Mendokusai\" under her breath after I returned the menu. 

?????? \"Mendokusai\" means something that requires effort but you don't feel like doing or dislike doing for whatever reason; bothersome.

Are you kidding me?! Just because I spoke English to you, it does not mean you can say sh*t in front of my face hoping I don't f**king understand?!"}
{"text":"Very typical Japanese restaurant runs by Chinese. Don't wanna mention about the food because it is not worth to pay. Server has to be retrained. She gave us attitude when we asked for separate bill. She gave us another attitude when she found out she brought us wrong bill. Definately no reason to go back. Improve your service and food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Their food is tolerable but not that tasty if I have other choices I would never go here.  Service is soooo bad.  The staff were not trained properly and was extremely rude.  DO NOT go here!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience on my last trip here so am downgrading this place. 
The non sushi items were OK like before but the sushi was inedible due to the rice being incredibly mushy.
We had to send it back (a first time for me at a sushi place) 
The Manager tried to convince us that that's how sushi rice is supposed to be! After a few minutes of going back and forth he caved and we got a fresh order of our items. A bit of an improvement but still left a lot to be desired. Not a very good experience. I think I will have to find another spot downtown to get my AYCE fix.
2 Star mainly due to the reasonable no sushi items."}
{"text":"Was in Scotia Plaza for meeting and decided to go for lunch. The food was beyond disappointing.  Miso soup was water, tempura batter was horrendous,  spicy tuna rolls were mediocre and all at relatively high prices.  Service was good but that's about it."}
{"text":"This place may have the most poorly executed sushi in the core.  Only come if you're absolutely craving it or aren't paying for it out of your own pocket.

I haven't been here in years, but had a craving and decided to give it another chance since my office is near by.  They've recently expanded their menu to include ramen, which is equally as bad.  I'm constantly amazed how it is able to stay open and occupy the real estate in Scotia Plaza.  Not only that, it's fairly busy at lunch...  surely by people who like cucumber rolls.

The spicy tuna was not spicy tuna.  It was a roll with a dollop of spicy mayo on top.  The roll was 90% rice.  

I also tried their \"aburi\".  I am not using the quotes liberally here.  Aburi is supposed to be blow torched sushi, but they sent what looks otherwise like salmon sushi with the top overcooked, then poured a mountain of tempura bits all over it to disguise how badly they screwed it up.  

Lastly,I was feeling udon.  I ordered the \"spicy beef udon\".  What I got was regular udon, tasteless sliced beef, and tons of chili oil in it.  Immediate stomach ache after.

This is a legit 1.5 stars, but there's no 1.5 so I'm rounding DOWN.  It's not even like the service was poor.  The only redeeming point here is the fact they sell hi-chews and pocky at the front.  I should have known, never again."}
{"text":"I have been to this store many times and I can pretty much call myself a regular. However, the frequent visit to this restaurant is not because of its quality, but because of its convenience. 

The positive element about this store that it is pretty much one of the few restaurants in the path that closes late. When all restaurants and food courts are closed, you can always rely on Ninki to provide you with the cure to hunger. This is especially important when working late and overtime at the financial district. Moreover, if you order the food over a certain dollar amount (can be $50+), then Ninki actually delivers to you. 

As for the quality of the food, I would say it is mainly average, with some of the food made well, and some made bad. For example: they have great value with their bento boxes. Both Bento A and B provide you with salad, miso soup, rice, tempura, sushi and the specialty dish (which is either chicken or beef). Their salmon set is also pretty good. However, that is not on the pricey end of the menu. For $16, you can get salmon sashimi roll, sashimi handroll and maki 

As for the bad quality food, their miso soup isn't the greatest. It is always too salty for me and I always need to drink lots of water after. Their oyako don is also made poorly. The MSG content is overdose and causes my taste buds to numb."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has received such poor reviews - Ninki is A-OK. Perhaps not the best sushi in the city, but conveniently located in the financial district and not overly expensive. I ordered Bento Box A ($14) and the yam tempura roll ($7) for dinner. I thought the bento price was very reasonable given the generous portions of rice, beef (or chicken or salmon etc), veggie and shrimp tempura, miso, salad, dumplings and california rolls provided. My friend ordered a don and also thought it was a fair price. Service is pretty decent, menu is extensive, and the food is just fine! :) I suspect I may return because it's so close by!"}
{"text":"If you walk by this place around 3 in the afternoon, you would be able to tell how much effort this place put into it's food.  Note that raw fish are required to be stored at a refrigerated temperature to keep bacteria and worms from growing.  But if you pass by at around three, their discount boxes are stacked on a table right beside the PATH.   There is no way a place run by professional who cares about their products would have this oversight.  I cannot imagine how they prepare the foods or process them behind the scene."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times for meetings with the bay street crowd and I have to say that I always kind of hate it.
I find the prices more than a tad high; the quality not that fabulous; and the service, while polite, incredibly slow and inattentive.
It's one of the FEW sushi restaurants in the financial district.  There are about five and none of it is good.  If you want sushi I highly reccommend leaving the neighbourhood or just going to one of those quick takeout places.

This place is not worth it and even though they do their best to make it nice inside the PATH it kind of kills the soul to be sitting in here eating without a window to the outside."}
{"text":"Convenient lunch in the financial district. Typically the wait time is short, service is prompt and food is served quickly. Unfortunately, there isn't much else going for this place.

Today I ordered a bento box. The lowlights were the California rolls that were falling apart, the miso soup that tasted funny, and the rice which was crunchy. The salmon sashimi, beef teriyaki and tempura were fine. For $18 I polished off my entire meal and was hungry 2 hours later... needless to say the portions are small.

Overall, If this place wasn't a hop, skip, and a jump away from my office I wouldn't be back. Unfortunately this place is just too darn convenient. I will continue to eat here and be unhappy with my meal."}
{"text":"Yuck. This used to be decent, inexpensive sushi--nothing fancy, but good, basic sushi on the PATH. My last two experiences have been less than pleasant. The service is fine, but the quality of the fish has become subpar and I left half of my most recent lunch uneaten. In all honesty, I've had better supermarket sushi than what I've had at Ninki lately. It's a shame, because this used to be a regular lunch spot of mine. If you must eat here, avoid the tuna at all costs. I hope things improve here."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch. I was craving for sashimi, so I ordered the salmon combo. It came with a free miso soup. The salmon sashimi was okay. 

The salmon skin roll was flavourful. I really enjoyed the sake clams soup. It was quite tasty, the soup base can use more flavours, but they were quite generous on the clams. Pretty convenient spot located in the path to grab sushi!"}
{"text":"Overpriced bad quality food. Finally tried this place after walking past it while walking through the underground path. Worst ramen I have had in Toronto yet and SO overpriced ( $16/ bowl of spicy pork ramen). The pork was so dried up and the soup tasted like pure MSG. Service was terrible considering we were the only customers in the restaurant. I think this place only stays open and gets away with it because its
located in the PATH and all the people on lunch break go there."}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 2013-02-14
Bill Total (after taxes): $74.58

It is very hard to swallow the acceptance that my girlfriend and I had our Valentine's Day dinner here.

We were debating where to go since virtually every fine dining restaurant is packed. We walked through the PATH since it was raining, and along the way was Ninki. After walking for a bit, we decided eat here.

The Valentine's Day menu captivated me; dinner for two, prix fixe at $78.00, there were two choices to choose from, A and B (I wished I took a picture). Both featured miso soup, a salad, a starter, an entrée, dessert, and a drink. As my girlfriend wanted me to surprise what we would get, I reluctantly choose the first option, 'A'.

Here we go...

Two drinks were included with the dinner; we both ordered hot Hakutsuru sake (5oz).

1. Soup - The miso soup is nothing to rave about, and it was hard to accept it as a course. Edamame would have been a great complement to the miso soup

2. Salad - The avocado salad with chef's homemade dressing top with three types of fish/seafood was although fresh, there was more imitation? crab meat, than salmon. The iceberg lettuce underneath the sliced avocados were not separated properly, shoving lumps of lettuce into my mouth. There was also no dressing in the salad. The sliced cucumbers lining the rim looked like a desperate move to cover most of the plate's white space.

3. Appetizer - The seared salmon sashimi and seared salmon nigiri with mayonnaise, red and green onions, and tempura crumbs were delicious. It was lukewarm, assuming it was left sitting in the kitchen before it was served to us. My girlfriend, who is not fond of salmon at all, loved this dish.

4. Entrée - The beef teriyaki over a bed of vegetables with skewered grilled shrimps eventually brought the overall experience to our downfall. The whole dish was cold except the meat itself. I really hate when parts of a completed dish were not plated at the same time, which really turns me off. The vegetables were cut too small, and were drenched in teriyaki sauce. The shrimps were over-grilled, tasting only the char. Even the rice, separated into their own bowls were cold.

This is where I asked the server for a manager, as I find the server is at no fault for this entrée to be so bad. She asked what is wrong with the dish, so she can forward the information to the manager. My girlfriend saw the server forward the information to the manager, who was built, and simply wearing a golf shirt--the sushi chefs even dressed better than him. By to the issue, I assumed he cannot speak English, as the server told me to tell her first about the problems. She came back and told us the manager applied a $20.00 discount to the bill. Though I accepted the discount, I can't accept the fact that the biggest part of the meal is left on the plate. The final course came afterwards.

5. Dessert - The crème brûlée, coffee-flavoured? gelatin, and green tea gelatin was to be a great finish to the dinner. But because of what happened in the previous course, we simply munched only the crème brûlée.

The bill came, and the server showed the $20.00 discount was applied. Right before we left, I gave Eriko (the server, once I saw the bill with her name on it) a $20.00 tip.

Me: \"Dozo\"
Eriko: \"EHHHHH!?!?\"
Me: \"Arigato gozaimasu.\" *bows to Eriko*
Eriko: *surprised* *bows many, many times*"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the service was slooooow.  We waited what seemed like forever (hungry!!) to get our food.  It was a late lunch and there weren't even that many people dining in.  The food, although delicious, was on the pricey side.

DEEP FRIED HAMACHI ROLL $9 - I thought the deep fried part was insinuating that the outside is going to be crispy while the fish would still be raw, but they deep fried the entire roll until the fish is cooked.  Is that still considered sushi?  It's like, cooked sushi.  It was good, but I was in the mood for raw.

My coworker ordered a bento box - $15.  It was a lot of food (soup, salad, shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, 2 pieces salmon sashimi, rice and cooked salmon (other options include chicken, beef or pork).

Location: Scotia Plaza building.  The decor and ambiance is very nice and it was a treat to dine outside the office for lunch.  The glass window to the PATH foot traffic makes for interesting people watching ."}
{"text":"At first glance this place might be mistaken for a half hearted McSushi joint in the underground path, but it actually offers fantastic variety and quality of Japanese food. I find it funny that besides their internal seating,  they also boast a \"patio\" (although you are still in the underground path when sitting there). 

I have heard that going at lunch time is always too packed which leads to bad service. Also, I suspect that their quality of food is much worse during their rush time, but whenever I go in the evening the food is fantastic. 

Best dish for me is the unagi pizza as well as their cuttlefish. 

Ninki is surprisingly affordable, considering that it's location is in the heart of the financial district."}
{"text":"So loud you can't hear the person from across the table from you. So busy the tables are packed so close together you feel like you are eating with your neighbours.  Overpriced, vanilla sushi (zero flare or pride, just manufactured in vast quantities for a lot of people). Decent quality ingredients. Decent sized portions. Slightly overpriced, but expected because it is in the ScotiaPlaza office tower."}
{"text":"4 stars? 5 stars? Whaaaaaa ?!

Came here on a Friday night with a few peeps from Yelp for a UYE (thanks to Karl for organizing it).

Situated in the basement of the Scotia Plaza in the PATH, it was relatively easy to find. They have another location on street level right across the street so don't get confused. The service was okay; it would have been nice if they were a tad bit more attentive. I liked the banana tempura with ice cream, but all the maki sushi were mediocre imo. My $32 meal was probably to pay for the location more than anything else.

Eek, me thinks not, indeed."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my trip to this restaurant. We reserved ahead of time for a work lunch. The menu is varied and the presentation was great. The staff served us promptly knowing we had to return to work after lunch. It's in a busy location so beware of crowds and if you don't reserve ahead of time you might not get a seat."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend during a weekday after work. We went with their all you can eat menu. It was $25.95 per person before tax and tips. I really enjoyed my dinning experience here. The location is very convenient, they are located in the PATH at Social Plaza. The servers were all friendly and welcoming. The environment is nice and quiet. The seating was comfortable. I didn't feel cramp in as some other sushi places because they are small they try to pack in as much seating as they can. This place the seating is nicely spaced out so you don't feel like you are cramp in as you are enjoying your meal. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was some of the cooked dishes were a bit on the salty side. But otherwise, thought this place was great. I will definitely come back and would recommend others to come here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated in the PATH at the concourse level of the Scotia Plaza building. From the outside, it looks really clean and modern...and always very packed! My sister and I had lunch here one day and although it was busy we were seated immediately and our orders were taken right away. It seemed as though the staff was trying to take orders and get food out as quickly as possible which kind of dampened our experience since we felt rushed the whole time but I guess from a business perspective this tactic would make sense considering they are in the heart of the financial district and are trying to accommodate as many customers as they can during the lunch hour rush.

The food was pretty good but very pricey. I wouldn't say it is the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto but certainly one of the better ones in the financial district. I ordered the soft crab shell, toza tofu, and spicy scallop rolls. The soft shell crab was breaded and deep fried and tasted very fresh and juicy. It was served with a ponzu sauce which was very salty and tart and a good complement to the sweetness of the crab meat. The soft shell crab has a subtle texture and hardly even noticeable when biting into it. I would recommend this as an appetizer for my fellow crab lovers out there. The toza tofu was also very tasty and served with the same ponzo sauce. It was crispy on the outside with a soft middle. The tofu and ponzo sauce are a great combination together which I thoroughly enjoyed. Finally, the spicy scallop rolls were not too spicy but had just the right amount of heat so one can enjoy all of its encompassing flavors. There was a good amount of scallops in each roll and they did not have an overpowering seafood flavor. This is something I would order again.

In terms of atmosphere, I felt like I was in a food court the whole time I was there. There were several people bustling around (either leaving or being seated) and the noise level was very loud and amplified. It was really difficult to have a conversation with my sister over the clanging of cutlery and chatter of other people. I don't think we could really fault the business on this however it is something to consider if you are looking for a restaurant with an intimate ambiance. 

Overall, the food (taste & quality) was decent but the service could have been better. Like I said, the atmosphere isn't exactly cozy and intimate and I didn't really enjoy being rushed in and out of the place but I guess that is what happens when you choose to have lunch in one of the busiest areas of the financial district. 3 stars aint bad, maybe better another time."}
{"text":"Ok food, price is average for lunch. Portion size is bigger than what I expected, which was a good surprise. Flavour is average, nothing you can't get at a AYCE joint."}
{"text":"After passing by this place so many times, I finally tried it. Even though it is situated within a busy section of the path, the soundproof walls and tinted windows make it a comfortable experience. The place is very sophisticated, polished.

AYCE is ~$26/person. If you want tea it is $1.25 extra/person

The sashimi here is actually not bad. The slices of salmon are thick and smooth. The aburi salmon sushi, topped with dynamite roll crumbs and tobiko, is super tasty. I also like their sukiyaki soup udon. 

Service isn't the quickest (for a slightly  empty restaurant)  but that's probably because they have only a few sushi/cooking chefs that are carefully putting everything together, which is fine! For dessert, there is only mango and vanilla icecream that is included in the meal."}
{"text":"Went over during lunch time on a weekday. Got seated right away. Place was pretty full but had a extra section on the outside. (Patio, but indoor) food came pretty quickly. I ordered the Garlic Ramen to try. Nice and hot but just a little salty for my taste bud.

Overall : 4*
Service : 4.5*
Food : 3.5*
Cleanliness : 5*"}
{"text":"This is a swanky Japanese restaurant located near where I work. I've come here on numerous occasions for lunch, both work and personal. While I have enjoyed the sushi, I once ordered the oyako don, not once but twice, and it was regrettable the 2nd time around. I may not be the expert in donburi, but I don't like it when it's too soupy.

I recently returned for take-out. It's stupendous they have ready make sushi trays. I am sorry I am too ignorant and absent-minded to take notice of the kind they keep. But if it makes it easy, they only have 2 types of sushi trays."}
{"text":"Good place for a business lunch getaway. You need Resos mon-fri from 12-2 as the Bay Street lunch crowd swarms into the place. Service is average for a sushi joint, it's an average sushi fix."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the atmosphere. There are quite a couple of things that were undelightful about our lunch meal.

The meals are costly and over the price for the proportion. 

My friend and I got the ramen. The ramen was basically water. It tasted like nothing. The ramen came after 35 minutes of a wait which was understandable considering it was a hefty lunch rush. 

The service was sub par; we had two waitresses. Their service was quite ying - yang from one another. One of the waitress could not be bothered with us. When asked for hot sauce, we were served with an EMPTY container. It took us multiple attempts to get her attention to order. Finally we had to order from the management. Our other waitress was lovely and provided us with water consistently throughout the meal. 

Bottom line:

Do not order the ramen and this place is too expensive."}
{"text":"I gave Ninki another try. I met CUTE! Chinese Girl in the Financial District. \"Where do you want to eat?\" \"All you can eat sushi?\" The way her face lights up when you say \"all you can eat sushi\" never gets old.

It's on the pricey side for AYCE sushi although it does have sashimi. $23 isn't, I guess, out of line when sashimi is an option. 15% gratuity is added automatically, even for a party of 2. I might have tipped more based on nice service (you seem to have 3 people working your table). You do need to inspect the bill closely to even see the 15% was added. 

The food itself. Meh."}
{"text":"Horrible service & food. It is not worth to pay for the food...I have ordered the soba with sashimi ..when the waiter delivered the soba and the dipping sauce together .....I was so surprised .....the dipping sauce with the real ICE...r u kidding me? oh..my god... I don't even taste anything.....just like I am dipping the water.......at the end, I ate my 6 piece of sashimi and gave up my soba :("}
{"text":"Ninki is my guilty pleasure. I'm very picky about my sashimi - I'd rather pay a little more for fresh quality and variety, but somehow I still like Ninki's chirashi. The standard salmon, tuna, egg, crab and red snapper, and the most special thing that I come here for - the salmon chunks mixed in mayo-salad dressing. It just works when you want a little chirashi within the convenience of the PATH!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 during lunch on a Friday. I expected it to be quite busy, but the restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating. Even so, service was slow, so I think there's a lot of room for improvement organizationally.

I ordered the cold soba with salmon sashimi. Presentation was fabulous, though I wasn't completely sure how to use the quail egg and sauce. Sashimi is just about my favourite thing, and the slices here were thick and fresh. Most items are on the pricier side, so I would recommend a noodle dish or bento box combo. 

A decent meal, but there are plenty other options downtown that would probably offer a better experience."}
{"text":"The Spring Rolls were not crispy in the inside (like with grated carrots/ cabbage), the Avocado in the salad was over-ripe. The food was very tasty otherwise."}
{"text":"We came here because of convenience. Despite the less than stellar reviews, and because of the frigid temperatures outside, a colleague and I came here for lunch because it was a convenient option accessible via the underground PATH and we didn't want to walk outside (not in the snow, anyway!) It's located right beside the Scotia Plaza Winners, and across from Mio Ristobar and Cafe. 

We arrived for our 12:00 PM reservation and were seated right away. Note that they only have 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM reservations during lunchtime (on the hour, every hour). 

On the whole, the experience was average. I feel like people use this place as a venue for business lunches out of convenience, and not because the food is great (because it's not). We ordered two bento boxes (A and B), and the chicken fried karaage appetizer. The karaage was really chewy and felt undercooked. The bento boxes were fine but nothing spectacular - the only highlight was probably the beef in Bento Box B, as I was surprised at how flavourful the beef actually was. Not a bad option.

Overall, it isn't my top choice in the area, but if you're looking for convenience in the Financial District, specifically within the PATH system, this is a reliable, reasonably priced option. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid almost and approximately $50.00."}
{"text":"A hive of activity at lunchtime, I would have expected these worker bees to have given us a higher level of service seeing as we were in the financial district where efficient, well paced lunches are a norm.  My dining companion got there early and snagged a table, no reservations between 12 and 1, and waited without being attended to at all until we had both been sitting there for 5 minutes looking around hungry and serverless.  

Our order was simple, \"2 Bento Box Bs, we'll both have water and green tea please\".  Only my companion got her water. They brought our soup and salad first, quickly followed... WAY TOO QUICKLY followed by the rest of our meal.  We were overwhelmed by our cramped table for two, not really sure what to do with all the food in front of us.  I guess we should eat the warm dishes first? The food was just ok.  Not that I was expecting a crazy sushi experience, but I think it being presented to us all at once didn't let us really enjoy any it the way I would have liked.

We sat with our piles of used dishes for what I considered to be too long and had to ask a random server passing by for our bill since our server was nowhere in sight.  

I'd walked by this place countless times in the underground thinking it looked kind of neat, it's pseudo-patio jutting out into the underground and it's modern Japanese décor... unfortunately it didn't deliver they way I had hoped at all."}
{"text":"Apart from the convenient/accessible location, there really isn't much else going for this place. The food is average at best when compared to any other GTA AYCE Japanaese restaurants. The AYCE is overpriced given the quality of food (but to be fair, it is the PATH after all). If I'm in the mood for sushi, any of the Sushi Shop locations would produce much higher quality sushi than this place (despite being food court-style stands). Honestly, I would not come here if it weren't for my coworkers who occasionally like to drop by for a visit."}
{"text":"The food came out quickly and the quality taste were surprisingly good for AYCE sushi!  We got all of the items we requested (at least I think we did-  I was there with a group of 15 and we ordered an insane amount of food). I would definitley recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I just had my first time at Ninki last night. I am not going to lie, but the table setting outside of the restaurant threw me off. I thought I would have to sit in the middle of THE PATH, open to everyone. Luckily, there was seating inside. 

The waiters were friendly and always came around to refill our waters which is always a major plus for me! 

I ordered the bento box B - salmon. There was a choice for the meat: chicken, beef and salmon. The price was fair, $16, since it came with a lot of food and rice.

- Salad and miso soup: Nothing out of the ordinary 
- 6 piece California roll: Decent and again, very typical
- Teriyaki salmon: The sauce was good, and the portion of the salmon was big. I enjoyed Ninki's salmon since some of the other Japanese restaurants I've tried tend to overcook the fish. (Side note: My friend had ordered the chicken instead, and she said it was very salty...)
- 2 piece shrimp tempura and 4 piece vegetable tempura: Loved it! I liked how they gave a variety of vegetable tempura: pumpkin, broccoli, eggplant and taro. I'm a sucker for taro and pumpkin tempura.
- 3 piece salmon sashimi: I was shocked when I saw the portion of their sashimi. Each piece was at least 2 fingers wide and very very thick. I have never seen such large sashimi in my whole life...

I was disappointed that the bento combo did not come with ice-cream. :(

I also noticed that this restaurant offered AYCE. The price is $23.95/person on weekdays and there is a wide selection. 

Would I go back? ...Probably not. It just missed the wow and captivating factor for me (nothing out of the ordinary)."}
{"text":"This is a convenient place in the PATH. Food is pretty subpar, especially the take out sushi. The sushi for the AYCE is slightly better (i.e. rice is not refrigerator cold), but still not great. Would only come here out of convenience rather than quality/taste."}
{"text":"I am very surprised to read the comments about this restaurant, particularly when I visit often and receive incredible food & service. The place is ALWAYS bustling with people. Prices are high for two reasons; located in Financial District & quality of fish is excellent. Orders consist of miso soup, sake (salmon) sashimi, salmon pizza, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and unagi maki."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Wednesday and I ordered the sashimi combo for 20. I had constant diarrhea for the last 3 days.  Not recommended"}
{"text":"Ninki is always packed during the weekday lunch.  You can see all the bankers pile into here for AYCE or bento boxes that fly out of the kitchen really quickly.  Service is conundrum as it's nonexistent when it comes to ordering but it's like lightning when it comes to placing it on your table.  This Japanese restaurant is in the basement of the Scotia plaza and it has an 'interior' that is quite nice.  Blonde wood is everywhere and it's fairly clean.  There's an 'exterior' seating that's not enclosed.  Oddly enough, I find the exterior seating quieter and better than inside.  The noise level is something out of a Chinese dim sum restaurant.

For food quality, this restaurant is probably the worst of the bunch in the Bay St area.  I found the shari rice wet, damp, and warm ... quite gross when combined with luke warm tuna.  Sushi pieces are ragged and looked like were cut with a chain saw.  Maki rolls are equally mashed together and looks like rolled under a car first.  The california roll avocado was brown...ew.  The bento boxes come with the typical tempura.  I say pass on them.  They're overly battered and not fried well.  They're heavy with oil and tempura batter that is slightly undercooked... it makes for a gross combination on vegetables.  

I'm not sure why this place is popular but the price point may have something to do with it.  It's the cheapest of the sit down sushi available in the area.  Delivery of the items are fast so if you only have a short amount of time, then this won't kill your lunch hour.  It's pretty decent for groups as I've seen them sit 12+ at a time.  If I'm super desperate for sushi during the lunch hour and I'm at King and Bay, I rather head to the underground path in Commerce Court.  There's a little Japanese sushi take out place that is right beside Four.  It is slightly cheaper and the quality of food is better."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this one a 5 star, because this has turned into my favourite place for AYCE sushi. The main reason is because for dinner time, this place is pretty empty and you will have no problem getting a table (unlike Sushi Island). The place is clean and has a nice feel to it.

The selection of sushi rolls and special rolls are really good. This place has all the usual suspects on the menu that most AYCE places have, but I found the quality to be a bit better than the other places I have been to.

Couple of could do better things;
1) How I long for some beef sashimi to be on the menu
2) Their AYCE menu just has names listed of things with no description, so you have to cross reference it with their full menu to see what the names mean

All in all this is a must try place in the circuit of AYCE sushi in the downtown core."}
{"text":"At first, I thought the end of the day 2 for $10 was a good deal for your choice from an assortment of fried rice, yakisoba noodles, and sushi rolls.  However, as I am having my chicken fried rice now, I notice that it is all rice and hardly any pieces of chicken! It seems like only the leftover bits of chicken were used, as there are no pieces of chicken bigger than my fingernail, not joking.  Also, the salmon tempura rolls I picked up had lots of rice around it that it you can't even eat the sushi in one bite. Only half of the rolls were salmon, and the rest were imitation crab meat.  Like other reviewers said, the only thing this place has going for it is the underground location in the PATH.  Glad that I never had the chance to eat inside this overpriced restaurant as I can only imagine what that would be like!"}
{"text":"I always grab the take-out dinners here around 5pm because it's 50% off and it's super convenient for me. The sushi itself is decent - but it's not great. It's better than standard pre-packaged sushi, but I would never pay regular price, let alone dine in for AYCE."}
{"text":"$18 damn dollars for take-out ramen, and they didn't bother to tell me when it was ready, either. Given that there are like three million lunch places in the Finance District, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh, Ninki's Japanese Cuisine.

I decided to try out the \"All You Can Eat\" ($23 per person) menu. My boyfriend and I ordered two miso soups, edamame, some dumplings, shrimp tempura, Salmon Crunch Roll, White Tuna Crunch Roll, Rainbow Roll, Beef Teriyaki Roll, and the Deep Fried Salmon roll. 

For some reason, we got our sushi before the miso soup. The waiter must have forgotten about it because we had to re-order it a few minutes later. When we finally got it, we had eaten about half of our meal.  The miso was nothing special. The dumplings were, by far, the best part of my meal.So delicious! I would have ordered more but our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Ninki's crappy service defeats the whole purpose of an \"All You Can Eat\" restaurant.  How can you order \"All You Can Eat\" when your waiter is missing in action?

As for the sushi, I'm allergic to cucumber so I didn't try the Rainbow Roll, but my boyfriend mentioned it was tasty. The Beef Teriyaki roll was a little bit bland, the Crunch rolls were okay, but not crunchy enough for my taste. The deep fried salmon roll was good, but not very memorable.

There was something very unsatisfying about the meal and the service, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Ninki's Japanase Cuisine serves average Japanese food. There are better places out there."}
{"text":"Disappointed with their $15 Ramen. Deep fried chicken was ok. Beef in lunch box was quite salty."}
{"text":"Trash sushi for two: $40.
We popped by Ninki on the PATH after work. This place gets busy during lunch and occasionally for early dinners. We tried a fair sampling of the menu: sushi, makimono, and donburi. My how we were disappointed!

The fish was old; most of it had lost its taste. The fish that did have a strong taste was very fishy. The slices were thin and long, piled on a giant heap of rice, served with gray-green wasabi, which is just as well, because you don't want to really taste that fish. 

You won't find any sweet and succulent salmon or beautifully marbled tuna here! 

The donburi was a culinary abortion, some vague semblance of what it should be. The onions were semi raw and not properly cooked, the real flavor of the dish hid behind a lackluster sauce, the breading on the pork was a soggy mass, and the pork itself was a hideous amalgam of fat and chewy grizzle. 

So sad! Worst meal I've had in awhile.

I've lived in Tokyo. I know good sushi. Ninki serves the opposite."}
{"text":"All thou can eat sushi in the base of the Scotia Plaza. Usually when you tell someone that a restaurant is in the PATH, they are usually dissuaded by the fear of getting forever lost in its subterranean retail labyrinths, doomed to spend an eternity subsisting on Jugo Juice and Druxy's, and shivering in a loincloth made from scraps of Danier leather.

So take heed: the easiest way to get get here is to enter from the North doors, on Adelaide, right across from South of Temperance. One escalator ride down and there you are, Ninki. In spite of not really being \"inside\" a restaurant (a fancy trellis separated us from the PATH), the atmosphere is fine, and quite un-PATH like.

But that's only if you want to come here. At $24 this AYCE is steep. I thought the rolls were tasty, but nothing eye-popping. There are better options in the city.

Obligatory Title Pun: Nin-KEY to PATH survival.

Menu Readability: Charming.

Need to mention: I didn't get mercury poisoning.

What this place teaches me about myself: I should write a PATH survival guide."}
{"text":"This is a very popular place for lunch - it is crowded during the weekdays with people working in the financial district. I came here on a Friday evening and it provided for an intimate setting. There were a few tables and it was quite casual and relaxed. 

I think the benchmark of a good sushi/sashimi restaurant is how they make their chirashi don (or an inside out sushi burrito\". Ninki truly meets that test as their salmon and salmon chunks (covered with a delicious mayo sauce) is really fresh and tender. The tuna actually does melt in your mouth and is complemented by sesame on a bed of rice. Ninki knows how to get it done. 

I will be sure to be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm often told that my opinion matters to a lot of people because I'm usually right. So you can take my review with varying grains of salt, depending on which way you slice it.

With that being said, this restaurant is definitely a Nin-NO for me... My coworker foolishly thought that this would be a good place to have lunch because it's an aesthetically pleasing restaurant to look at. However, the food and the service are equally as unappetizing.

Our dining experience started with an appetizer, a nice 45-minute wait for our waiter to tell us that the food is coming soon. Following this was the main course; a table next to us being served spoiled fish and having management not giving one sliver of concern over the fact that she may have had rotten fish (good job). Last but not least was dessert, our ramen was watery and tasted as if Gordon Ramsay's mute half-brother made it while he was in a coma (probably from the food poising from this place). My friend's beef udon tasted like an abusive childhood with not even a semblance of a brighter future.

All in all, this place is trash and should be treated as trash. Ninki is only still in business because the owner luckbox'd the prime location that has given it this halo of invincibility which has allowed it to get away with such shitty food and service."}
{"text":"I go after 5pm on my way to the train after work to get their 50% off sushi boxes.  There's an assortment of boxes on a table for you to choose from. A great snack for your train ride home or an easy and cheap dinner. Quality is not bad give it's discounted. Plus it's convenient.  Would like to come back to try their ramen."}
