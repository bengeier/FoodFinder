{"text":"Played this past weekend and the course was in great shape.  Greens were about as good as they can get for November golf."}
{"text":"Horrid conditions. Poorly maintained and I hear they are in serious financial trouble.  The Carolina Trail seems to be a last resort for these courses to get some play.  However, from what I can see they go downhill fast."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time playing this course. Looks like they gave up on maintance. Horrible conditions, bunkers don't have sand, greens are bumpy. Flag stick are broken. Spend your money elsewhere !!"}
{"text":"I was told that the course was taken over by new management and they refused to fix issues such as a broken irrigation system this past summer which explains the poor grass condition.  But this course shows a complete lack of care for even the beginner golfer regardless of the irrigation system.  The greens are covered in weeds, divots and dead spots.  The sand traps look like ponds days after the last rains in the area and they mulched the grass when mowing the holes which is left as huge clumps of dead grass all over the fairways.  There were also fire ant hills all over the fairways and greens which you have the look out for.  One false step while swinging or dropping a club in the wrong spot could result is an ant problem.  I am not sure how maintenance misses dozens of 3 foot by 3 foot fire ant hills on greens and fairways per hole, but they did.

If you need a cheap, last minute tee time with no push from other foursomes, this is the place.  Otherwise drive an extra 10 minutes to much better public courses for the same price."}
{"text":"Great course. Play was a little slow but overall great place to play. The best course in the university/concord area."}
{"text":"Highland Creek Golf Club is a great place to Relax, Enjoy some scenery, and participate in some good old fashioned golf. 
Although the course is roughly messy and ragged.
I loved my experience and the drive across Highland Creek.
But I wouldn't give this 5 stars simply because of a staff member by the of Mark.
He was very obnoxious, and highly rude.

Mark's high level of complacent behavior was simply the reason I will never attend another day at the Highland Creek Golf Club.

Another issue I had is on these so called \"Family Nights\" I attended there were only golfers and all the advertised things were apparently just for them."}
{"text":"Played on 5.9.15 in the pm. A nice, modern facility and staff. The course has great potential, but still needs some time for the fairways and greens to be great. The fairways were very firm and fast, the greens were in ok shape with some issues on the back nine and unfixed ball marks were rampant. This course is set in a nice part of greater Charlotte and I would recommend it. I would like to see if it improves by fall."}
{"text":"Played 18 today and the tee boxes, fairways, and bunkers were in good shape. The greens were another story. Very bumpy, pocked, and had other grass tufts throughout. Some putts were over dry browned out sections. 

Decent value with a ClickIt coupon for 4. 

Overall we had a good time and hope the greens recover in the fall."}
{"text":"Played here on Father's Day and right out of the gate, I was told the rough lawnmower broke. As a result the course looked like it had not been mowed in 2 weeks. Even the greens had weeds growing out of them. As if that wasn't bad enough, on a day when it was 90 degrees and the humidity was high, there were no water coolers on the course. The beer girl made a couple of rounds and she was nice but there was nowhere to refill the water bottles. I can understand the lawnmower breaking and being unable to cut the grass but not having water coolers on the course on a hot day in mid-June is unacceptable. Not sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"If you want a lesson on how to DESTROY what was once a PREMIER Golf Course, look no further than Highland Creek Golf Course. I've been a resident of Highland Creek for the past 25 years and recently played the course. It was and is an embarrassment. I could say much more about the condition, but it is very obvious they barely doing what they have to do just to keep it open. It is SICKENING what has happened to this course."}
{"text":"Played Highland Creek last week and for the amount of play it gets, I was pleasantly surprised at the condition the course was in. Fairways were in good shape, traps were all raked and edged and the greens were pretty fast. Outside of a few dry patches on the greens and some unmowed tee boxes, I was very happy with the course. Very wooded in some areas and there are some places where a driver just won't work off the tee. Very rarely will you find wide open shots if you miss the fairway. 

Normally priced at $60 for a Saturday round, I found a coupon, as usual, on clickitgolf.com that had $10 off. There was a tournament /outing there late morning, so with our 8:30am tee time we were able to get out and back in less than 4 hours."}
{"text":"We played 18 holes today and was my first and probably last visit.  The course was in BAD shape, bunkers we rock hard, several had sand bags in the sand, lots of erosion, and you could walk in the bunkers, step out and they were so hard you couldn't see your footprints....they were that hard.  

The greens were weed infested with goose grass, looked like someone forgot to make preemergent applications this year....greens were mowed good but very bumpy from all the weeds. (photo below).

Several fairways were covered with sticks and pineneedles, and markers were almost impossible to find.  Looks like it was a nice course back in the day, but it's not being taken care of very well today.

{"text":"I would give this zero stars if possible. Horrible conditions. Carts, course is deplorable and it is a shame! Obviously the owners do not care about the Carolina trail anymore. This course will be dumped off to some group who will have to spend a fortune to get the course up to par. No pun intended."}
{"text":"This course is awful. Greens have weeds all over them. Sand traps are nonexistent, they have more weeds, leaves, and pine comes more than they do sand.

On the 15th green there was a huge skid and didn't even bother to play the last 3 holes."}
{"text":"For the first round of the year, I wish I picked another course. This was a little messy and just looked rough in most spots. The staff is friendly inside the shop, have to agree with the previous review, there was only one water cooler out. Overall wasn't extremely pleased with their course. I may return."}
{"text":"I have played Highland Creek Golf Course several times this year. The course is in great condition. The layout makes the course a challenge but is also the reason the course is fun and exciting to play. I would encourage you try out this course."}
{"text":"My dad played here today and I asked why he returned early. He said that this course is in the worst shape of any that he's ever played. He was infuriated! He recommended to the staff that they shut the place down for maintenance until minimum October. He said that recommendation was being nice. He reported it to some golfers association and would highly recommend anyone steer clear away from this place if they are looking for even remotely cared for greens. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful course with a great layout. Not sure where the other yelpers are coming from with their reviews?

The course is set up for faster play but there are some tricky holes. Fairways seem to stay in very good condition as do the greens. 

Perfectly priced for a great day out pegging it!"}
{"text":"Hi!  I live in the neighborhood and I was looking for somewhere local to watch the Panthers Game.  The bar had a drink special.  There were lots of other locals and they all brought food.  It was like a party.  I plan to visit again to support the neighborhood golf course and the community."}
{"text":"Nice course, beer & food specials everyday. I live in Highland Creek and it's very convenient."}
{"text":"Course is a wonderful layout. Overall conditions were the worst I have ever seen. It honestly felt like the course has been closed all season and it just reopened today...Tee boxes, tired in most respects. Fairways...horrible. Weeds everywhere and honestly it's probably been 3 weeks since they were last cut. Besides the grass type difference there was basically no difference to the rough. In all areas of the primary rough it was 5+ inches high and probably hasn't been mowed all season. Greens were punched 11 days ago and they were horrible. Bumpy as all can be, haven't been mowed in probably 2 days and if you didn't play a max 2 putt you'd probably quit after the first hole. Greens were slower than most fairways are on a normal 4 star course. Sand traps, nothing manicured and needs tons of work on every hole. I paid $40 for a \"aeration rate\" but I wouldn't go back for $5. There needs to be someone on every lawnmower, trimmer and roller they have for the next two weeks straight just to get the grass on the course back in decent playing conditions. Totally disappointed and wouldn't recommend this to anyone to play right now."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this course is in the worst shape of any course I've played since I started playing in 1996!  I am in town from Los Angeles for a family reunion and was really unaware of the shape of the course.  After playing 18 holes, I'm highly disappointed and likely will never play here again.  If you're wanting a recommendation from me, you won't get a favorable one.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been playing this course for years and right now it's in the best shape. I've seen some local courses take a beating from this past winter, but Highland Creek survived. It has a few bad spots, we're not talking about Augusta here. It's a great track to play during the week after work or on the weekend. The rough is a little long, but I like that. It challenges you to keep it in the fairway. Plus if they cut it short in this weather, it'd all die. Great track, great people, and fun. Plus it won't cost you an arm/leg like the rest of the courses."}
{"text":"This course has a great layout, however it is in very poor condition. I won't be back until they put some money into keeping the course up. The greens were atrocious. I've never seen such poor greens."}
