{"text":"One of my favorites. Personally, it's much better than Wild Thaiger downtown. I also like it a little more than Sala Thai on 32nd St & Shea, although I also like Sala Thai.  The staff is super friendly (they know me by name). I used to eat there almost weekly, but now I work / spend most of my time too far away.  As with all Thai food, when in doubt choose chicken as the meat. They've got great Pad Thai. I love their curry. (Thai curry is SO much better than Chinese curry. It's got coconut milk, so it's smooth, rich, and slightly sweet.) A lot of girls tend to order the Crispy Chicken with Spicy Cream Sauce. Don't order the calamari unless you absolutely love calamari (it's not breaded nor fried, BTW). The combo dessert is to die for (mango sticky rice, coconut ice cream, fried banana rolls).  They're usually super fast at bringing out food."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my passions. I long ago stopped eating Chinese food entirely--bland piles of flavorless noodles and weird sticky-sweet sauces, no thank you. And I don't have any use for cloying, syrupy Pad Thai dishes that roll around begging for your attention like some filthy two-dollar noodley whore. I like my Thai food spicy. Thai spicy. Pink Pepper delivers, and for that I dub thee the Best Thai in Phoenix.   My personal favorite dish is called \"Spicy Green Bean with Tofu\", aka Prik King. I'm a vegetarian, and they have a ton of veg options, but not to worry, carnivores, they've got your back. Unbelievably flavorful, with fresh vegetables--not fresh-frozen, really fresh. And spicy? They ask you to order your spiciness based on a 1-to-10 scale, 10 being the surface of the sun. Not coincidentally, very much like the \"pain scale\" you may find at hospitals. I order a 10, and they always ask me \"are you sure?\"--possibly for insurance purposes. So so good. If your tastes are milder, they'll take care of you. You'll get less heat but no less flavor.   I've only had the lunch buffet once--and it is a bit milder, as one would expect when feeding a crowd of suburbanites. It's a great opportunity to try dishes you've never had before, and if you want something stronger they're more than happy to let you order off the menu.   The service? Well, I live in California and I don't get into town that often. I've only eaten at the Pepper maybe 10-15 times over the last few years. But every time I walk in, the wait staff greets me by name and remembers what I ordered on my last visit.  Incredibly nice folks.   Atmosphere? Well, it's 1985 in there. I like 1985. Kind of a teal green/gray combo. It's a high end Miami Vice video type thing, sans neon. It's very unique, it has character and I sincerely hope they leave it the way it is. It's clean, well-kept, nice low-level lighting, great for a first date.   To recap: stop reading this and get down there post-haste."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! Everything at the table had us in Thai Heaven!! Our waitress was so nice and friendly and always made sure we had enough to drink! All that great food at such a great price! Can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"Mediocre Thai food. I had the Pad kee Mao, a dish that was supposed to be wok fried in a chili and garlic sauce, but I tasted no garlic and little chili - it was asi, asi. My lunch companion thoroughly enjoyed his panang curry and was sweating up a storm from the spice.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.  Oh well, it doesn't matter, with so many delicious options for Thai food in the valley, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. It is not too often you find a Thai Buffet yet alone one that serves fairly decent tasting food. This place does both and a really good job of the later. The selection is good here... My favorite is the dish with the fried fish fillet. It always hits the spot. I really like the 2 soups they have. I usually have 1 small bowl of each. The chicken with basil is good also. None of the dishes in the lunch buffet are bad but aside from the ones I mentioned earlier it's just decent. Hence the 4 stars versus 5.  For desert they have mini donuts... they taste like malisadas if your familiar with that.   Wait-staff is nice but I always need to tell them I need extra napkins."}
{"text":"This is a great, unassuming Thai restaurant - everytime we go, we ask ourselves why we don't eat here more.  The food is great - I routinely get Crispy Chicken in plum sauce and Ryan has Chicken or Beef Panang.  The flavors are just wonderful and it is consistent.  We've never done the buffet, but I am not a big fan of buffets in the first place.  (As many others have commented, it is hard to keep food fresh, warm and tasty in a steam tray.)  The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but it doesn't offend - kinda like an old kitchen that needs some updating (way too much laminate).    On our last visit, our waiter remembered our drink orders from memory.  I almost fell over backwards.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped here today for lunch after Pei Wei put me on hold. I was starving and needed food fast- plus I had a taste for something asian.  It seems they have changed their name to Tara Thai? At least thats what the sign seemed to say(?)   I opted for the buffet to go and was impressed by all the different selections- especially of noodles. I have a thing for noodles and tried three different kinds- one of which, called simply Chicken Noodles was AH-mazing! Big thick flat noodles with hunks of chicken and bean sprouts and onions. The Pad Thai noodles were also pretty scrumptious.   The onlly thing I didn't enjoy were the eggrolls. They looked like they were straight from a La Choy freezer box. Instead of homemade and all big and bumpy they were finger sized with that weird dough that is flaky on the outside but retains all the grease inside and tastes like hot dirt. Anyway, not a big deal but I'd figured I'd mention it. Must go back for the noodles."}
{"text":"Pink Pepper is terrific.  The only thing that would make it more terrific is faster service and updated decor.  But if you want authentic, tasty, spicy Thai food, you won't be disappointed.  It's probably the best Thai I've ever had.    I've only been for dinner twice and both times we were thrilled with our choices.  I am always blown away by the coconut/chicken/mushroom soup - it's ridiculously good and I could eat 4 servings. We've had various other items and they were all terrific, but I was NOT a fan of the Thai BBQ Chicken (basically a really bland, whole-BBQ'd chicken, cut up with a basic sauce.)    If you're a fan of spice, you will be pleased with their 10-point scale. I thought I could handle my own, but even a 6 was intolerable for me.    Reminds me of the great food in the Bay Area - definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best thai buffet in, at least, the north Phoenix area.  The food is awesome for the lunch rush and by no means healthy.  They'll even have some singapore rice noodles and a couple other southern chinese favorites for those who aren't into thai.  All of the common thai staples are here and frequently stocked.  They have the buffet game down.  What isn't so great is dinner service.  We'll leave it at that.  Coming for lunch is your best bet for quality and value."}
{"text":"I had the boofay yesterday with Ryan C. It was good. I liked being able to try it all and figure out what I do not like.   There was nothing that was really bad, and nothing that was really great. It was all good.   The coconut chicken soup thing was a little odd, but the chicken in it was really good quality and tasted good while added to other types of sauce.   OH YEAH... They painted and re decorated. It looks really good in there."}
{"text":"My BF and I went a couple days ago for dinner. Even though it was Saturday night, the restaurant wasn't that full and we were seated fairly quickly. The decor is definitely nothing to speak of, but it was clean. The color scheme, particularly the pink and lilac napkins, was a little strange, but I guess it's supposed to go with the name.  Unfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant. I guess I would describe it as a corner banquette where we were sitting at a 90 degree angle instead of across from each other. There was an older couple in their 60s or so sitting at the other end of the banquette, and no one in the booths across from us. Throughout dinner the older couple were discussing breast implants, recreational drugs, and menopause the musical. Because the area we were seated in was so empty we couldn't help but overhear their conversation which made for a very unpleasant dining experience.  Our server was a younger lady, I'd say late 20s/early 30s. From the moment she first came to our table things started off on the wrong foot. I was looking at the drinks menu and she made some comment about how I'm too young for that. Now I know that I look young and I don't have any problem with people saying that, but it was her tone that almost sounded like she was scolding me.  Anyway, we went on to order and started off with an appetizer. I don't remember the name, but I jokingly called it a Thai quesadilla. It was chicken, peas, potatoes, and maybe some other stuff wrapped inside a flour tortilla and served with peanut dipping sauce. The tortilla was folded in half and then cut into four pieces. We both liked the taste and flavors a lot but found it very difficult to eat the middle two pieces without making a mess.  For entrees, I ordered pad see ew and my BF ordered pad thai. Both dishes were okay, but we've had better. For the pad thai, I'm used to seeing the crushed peanuts and bean sprouts come on the side for you to mix into the noodles yourself. But it wasn't served like that. For the pad see ew, this is the second Thai place I've tried in the valley and neither has done it right. First of all, I wish they'd use real Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, but I can overlook that. What I don't understand though is why I keep getting asked what degree of spicyness I want. In my experience, pad see ew isn't supposed to be spicy. It's supposed to be cooked with a sweet soy sauce. The noodles were good and had a nice soft texture, but the flavor that I want just wasn't there. Also I ordered it with pork and there was something off about the pork. I think it was either old or just a very poor cut of meat.  Now here's why I ended up giving only two stars. By now the older couple had left and a new couple had been seated in one of the nearby boothes. Both tables had different servers who were very friendly and attentive. After we finished as much of our meals as we could, we sat with our plates untouched for 15-20 minutes and our server basically ignored us. I don't know if she forgot we were there or what. Also neither of the other two servers who kept passing by took notice that we were waiting to be boxed up and go. Finally I had to flag a server down and he went to get our server. She came and made some comment about how it looked like we were falling asleep (duh, we're tired of waiting) and then took our food to boxed up and brought back the check. Then she disappeared again for another 10 minutes before finally returning to pick up our credit card and ring us up.  I'm disappointed because Pink Pepper is pretty close to our house and I was really hoping that this would become a place we could visit frequently. While I'm not outright ruling the possibility of returning, I think we'll have to try some other Thai places first.  However, I do have to comment that I disagree with JBH J.'s review that the prices are high. I thought they were very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food... and Pink Pepper has some very good Thai food. They are the best place in town to get traditional Thai dishes.  Everything I have ever eaten there was well prepared, fresh and consistent.  Their prices push the high end of moderate, and the service is occasionally slow depending on how well staffed they are. That said, you will always have a good meal and never any bad surprises.  It is not the place to go for new imaginative food.  When you want good Thai and are not up to trying anything new, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Buffet's bring back bad memories. You wouldn't expect this, but growing up in rural Maine, the \"big city\" consisted of 30,000 yet somehow we managed to have more then a handful of glutton inducing Asian inspired buffet's. I am talking mega buffets, and I use the word \"inspired\" loosely.   Luckily Pink Pepper's lunch buffet is nothing like that. I am still somewhat skeptical about multiple parties digging into the same troughs full of food sitting out but whatever; live life dangerously.  I hit Pink Pepper every once in awhile with coworkers for their lunch buffet. The service is always prompt and friendly, that atmosphere is not tops but its not bad and always comfortable.   The lunch buffet is about $8.50 and they always have a handful of vegetarian/vegan items. Spicy eggplant, spicy tofu, spicy noodles, crispy tofu and vegetables, are just a few of the great dishes that are usually at the buffet. I don't get the feeling that this is the most healthy fare, but it's not overly oily either. It's also maybe not all authentic but it's close, and it's all very tasty and consistent.  We just went in this week and they have stepped up the buffet a bit more for 2010. They had fresh bowls of chopped scallions, cilantro, etc to top dishes. They also had a plate of veggie spring rolls and two different kinds of new peanut sauces to try with them and/or other dishes. These simple additions really show they are trying to enhance the buffet experience as much as they can and that's refreshing.  I can't comment on dinner but if you don't feel comfortable with the lunch buffet at least give them a shot with dinner."}
{"text":"Pink Pepper Thai Cuisine technically hasn't closed.  It's been replaced by Tara Thai.  Same menu, same atmosphere, same friendly wait staff and same delicious food!"}
{"text":"Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!"}
