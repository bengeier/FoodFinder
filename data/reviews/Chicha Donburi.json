{"text":"It's fine but won't try second time.
The pork donburi I ordered wasn't hot it's cold .... and the green tea mini cheese cake is really very miniiiiiiiiii"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from a friend, and we decide to give it a try. The decoration is not fancy but cozy. We ordered yaki don(BBQ pork), and the curry fried chicken. The portion was not too much, but enough to feed us. The seasoning was in my style. Overall, I think it is a restaurant that worth to try."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places when we visited Montreal. We are from NYC and have lots of Japanese and we highly recommend this place. We were a group of 14 and they were able to accommodate us. Super friendly too as half the group were kids."}
{"text":"You can't miss it. Highly recommended the fried chicken, Beef Donburi, and hamburger Donburi."}
{"text":"Ordered curry chicken katsudon, burger steak don, and fried chicken. The bowl and the amount of food is large. Not recommended if you don't eat much. The burger steak don and fried chicken are great but curry chicken katsu does not met my expectations. Both fried chicken and curry taste like Asian fusion instead of Japanese flavour. The food and service is generally good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the experience was very ordinary.

As soon as I entered the establishment, I was greeted by a cheerful waitress who ushered me to a table and handed me menus. There were only two other patrons at the time, so service was swift and attentive. I ordered the chicken curry katsu dish and a hot sugar/ginger/osmanthus tea; the total came to about 20$ after taxes and tips. 

The tea was interesting because we had to infuse it ourselves: we were served with a cup of hot water and, on the side, a mixture of the concentrated tea \"dough\" that looked like a piece of gingerbread cookie that we had to break apart and mix with the hot water. My appetite did open after taking a few sips. It was not bad, but not out of this world either.

The katsu arrived at a reasonable delay, and looked appropriately delectable. I was somewhat disappointed because the katsu was concurrently crispy and mushy because some the meat was overly drenched and saturated in the curry. I would have preferred more substantive ingredients such as meat or vegetables, and less rice. To be fair, the food was not bad. Nonetheless, it's nothing to write home about.

Overall, it was a positive experience, and I do not regret trying this restaurant. However, I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This is THE BOMB.COM BRUHH. Very nice atmosphere and nice staff. Super Saiyan equivalent of food. Loved it"}
{"text":"It was ok, but the place wasn't really Japanese, this is more of a Taiwanese eatery. I went there thinking I was gonna get Japanese food, that's probably why I was disappointed."}
{"text":"As a donburi lover?I was very excited to see this restaurant . However the dishes here did not reach my criteria...
I ordered Curry Katsu ?Yam fries?Genmai Tea and Matcha mini cheesecake
Katsu was small and dry?with too much rice and too little curry sauce.( And their curry was not homemade)

Yam fries was crispy and sweet?good to try.

Matcha mini cheesecake had right sweetness but it tasted ...neither like matcha nor like average level cheesecake.

Anyway, I think it's a good place to go if you're passing by but don't expect too much on it."}
{"text":"Small cute little restaurant located on bishop. The service was pretty nice as the girl was helpful and welcoming.

The food looks good. Taste is fairly simple with some veggies and meats. I ordered the taiwanese pop corn chicken for starter. Descent.

For The main dish i took the beef patties don.There was only 2 tiny pieces of meat and had some corn.cabbage.carrots. 

Whole meal with tax and tip cost me 26 bux.
1 hr after leavin the restaurant,i m feelin thirsty as hell n dizzy,maybe msg or something?

Food looks good but Not worth it and won't return"}
{"text":"Great food, I had the torikatsu which was amazing only complaint was the amount of chicken used in the dish wasn't as much as I expected. However, it was a great dish the service was excellent, the restaurant itself was very cozy, creative, and cool. I would highly recommend if you're looking for an affordable, lowkey, quiet, and nice dinner."}
