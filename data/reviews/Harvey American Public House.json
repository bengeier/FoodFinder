{"text":"New to the area and have been trying some different places each weekend. We had one of their yummy burgers and a flat bread and they were both delicious.  Brought left over flat bread home and enjoyed again the next day. Loved the different choices on the menu, had a fun waiter and waiter in training and it was an enjoyable experience. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing  food, just found my new lunch spot. It is a hidden gem. Chicken sandwich is my favorite made from scratch potato chips an a cookie!  Yummy"}
{"text":"Great afternoon at Harvey American public house"}
{"text":"I love this place! The music is great and the employees are awesome. They have a nice selection of beer to choose from and the food is great. The Harvey's seasoning on their fries is outstanding. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is cooled by misters and is rather nice even on the hottest of nights. During the winter they have some gas flames that heat up the outdoors. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great American food."}
{"text":"The first time we went it was just for drinks and we didn't have any food. Went this past Saturday night as we were looking for somewhere new for food. Uh....not good. I had the Pinapple Pico Burger (priced at $12), I'm not really sure why they call it this, because I tasted none of the so called Pinapple Pico, as a matter of fact there was not much flavor at all! The meat was not seasoned at all and was very dry. I ordered the house homemade chips instead of fries and although they were okay, they also needed more seasoning and I got wayyyyy to many of them...covered half the plate! My husband had their wings and they looked really good and he liked them. For 5.99 you get 8 wings or 1 lb. My kids ordered off the childrens menue and each had a cheeseburger. It was the right size for kids, but a little skimpy on the fries. I was however disappointed with the price of the kids menu...$5 and the drink was NOT included...that was $2 more, so basically $7 for a slider and a few fries and drink. Our waitress was nice enough, although I have to say she was pretty unknowledgeable about the bar drinks, when asked what flavors of vodka they had she gave a blank stare...all she had to do was turn around as they were all right behind the bar. There was another couple with us and we all had the same burger...cooked differently and they gave me my friends burger and me his. Need to be more observant I guess. I don't think we will be returning for meals, expensive and just not worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bars in the Gilbert area. They have a great beer selection and very inviting interior. The patio is hands down the best in the area. 

There is regularly live music which can be a positive or a negative depending on the music an how much talking you want to be able to do. 

The staff that I have interacted with have always been courteous and helpful. I have not tried the food so I can not comment on its quality. 

It's the only bar in the area that stays open until 2 a.m."}
{"text":"So welcome neighborhood bar!!!  Let me precede myself by being a bit bratty and telling you I know my shit...I also tend to give a new place the benefit of the doubt because we are in Gilbert of course (no offense people, I live here too).  I love walking in to see a cool indoor/outdoor bar but... no seats to be had, only not because it was that busy with local patronage, but that of the Harvey's staff, clearly enjoying their time off.  I only figured this out because as we began to order happy hour about 2-4 members of the staff, occupying the best seats in the house, talked obnoxiously.  Boooo!

The chicken wings were very good, Reuben just okay.  Beer:  good selection and good price alone and even better for Happy Hour.  Bartender:  lackluster and lack of everything else.  Maybe he was annoyed at his coworkers barking at him for the fried pickles...again, benefit of the doubt.

Overall, I want to give this place another go because it's one of the only open until 1 AM. out here when I come home from the real restaurants that would be crucified for doing shit like this!!!  Owell, benefit of the doubt..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good, especially the patio. Food was ok, came out cold. Not sure if it was the kitchens fault or the waitress. Service was deplorable. I usually go to Blue 32 which is next door, but the wait was too long that night so I thought I would try Harvey American. Next time I will wait it out at Blue 32."}
{"text":"Harvey American is a great addition to Gilbert.  I love that we have a nice bar that is open until 2am.  My friends and I have come here a few times and have never been disappointed.  The staff is very friendly and the food is very tasty.  The patio is great and they keep it cool for the July evenings."}
{"text":"The first time my wife and I came here was during their grand opening week and we were not impressed, food was not very good and had to wait forever after we ordered it, but management made things right so we decided to give them time to get established and try them again. I'm glad we did, went back last Friday and although they still have room for improvement in the food department, the overall experience was terrific, in part due to the awesome live band (Resonation) that started to play about the time we were getting ready to leave. The music, service and atmosphere was so good we ended up staying over 3 hours longer than we originally intended. We will definitely be returning, especially on the nights they have Resonation playing. If you like classic rock I highly recommend searching out the various bars they play and go listen to them."}
{"text":"I always like to support the local eateries in my area and wanted to give this place a try. I went into the deli side for lunch. The two guys making my sandwich were nice and friendly. The cashier not so friendly. He seemed put out for having to ring me up -being the only one person in there. I ordered the turkey pastrami. For the  pricey combo meal, I thought it was pretty skimpy/cheap to offer pickle or cookie.... Really?  My sandwich came and the lettuce was not only wilted to a lifeless state but it was also brown. Overall taste was bland and nothing special.
The best part was the nice patio and clean restrooms! 
I hope they improve because Gilbert needs more \"good\" places to eat!"}
{"text":"Harvey American has a cool wood pub theme going on. Everything is wood, even the walls are designed to make it look like an old wooden building. The furniture gives the place a cool smell as well. All in all, I loved the atmosphere. 

Our server was very nice, and their beer selection is great. They have a vanilla stout on tap which you should definitely try. 

The food was pretty good. Probably a bit better than next door, at least for lunch. I hope they get more popular so they fill up a bit more; whenever I've been by it's been pretty empty. For a pub in Gilbert, they're great, probably better than Rula Bula in Tempe."}
{"text":"The fries were great! The cheeseburger was also good.  The nachos were terrible. I think the cheese is what makes nachos good, but I think this came out of a can if that's even possible! Also the nachos came out with the entrée's when they were ordered as appetizers!"}
{"text":"Our first visit, sat on the patio. First and foremost I wish it was non smoking, having to smell cigarette smoke while eating is not pleasant. Anyway, we went on a Tuesday and liked that they have a Tuesday burger and beer special for $8.99. After looking over the menu the prices seems reasonable. The server was kind and timely and food was good. We loved the onion rings. I had the southwest burger and it was good. My husband had the pub burger and he liked it. We will return, perhaps for drinks and live music. It's nice to see a place that offers live music in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not appreciated at night. We just received horrible service from a rude man on the patio with many earrings.... I've never had a server roll his eyes at me before and I am a server! We came in around 10pm just for a bottle of wine and some cocktails. I'm sorry that's not good enough for you sir. We will not be returning. We went next door to Blue 32! Great service and a late night menu! They couldn't even find us a menu..."}
{"text":"Well, I can only comment on the service.  My husband and I have been wanting to try this out ever since it opened. We finally decided to go tonight - a Tuesday night. When we walked in, there was a sign instructing us to seat ourselves.   There were plenty of open tables, so we chose one.  We sat, and sat. 10 minutes later, no one had welcomed us, or said 'be right there' in fact, no one acknowledged our existence. So we left and had dinner elsewhere. Like I said, this was a Tuesday night and there were plenty of open tables - it's not like they were busy."}
{"text":"So disappointed!
We started with the wings, which came out with no seasoning! Just chicken, with ranch and blue cheese which we could not tell the difference between. No good :(

I ordered the chop salad. The salad was completely tasteless! $12 and it tasted like wet lettuce. I think there were a couple pieces of chicken at the bottom, but I had to dig.  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he said he had never tried it, but hopefully I would like it better next time. I informed him there will never be a next time and he ignored it and handed us the bill. 

We also had a manager stop over and ask us about our meal, but even with our honest reply, she didn't seem too concerned that we weren't happy.

It is now obvious to me that with this food and service, the only reason they are still in business is because they get overflow from patrons who don't want to wait at blue32. I will never be back there myself!"}
{"text":"Good food, good Muzak wait staff is a little off tonight but they are so nice I just won't complain KDS"}
{"text":"Lets put it this way.  I created a yelp account to review this place.  Arrived n told to sit wherever.  Place was dead.  Waitress didnt offer high chair for daughter so had to search for one..on both high chairs available the straps were broken.  Next waited 10 mins for waitress to get waters and take orders.  ok no biggie.  food took 30+ mins to come out.  Seriously...what are they doing, its just us and one other table in the place.  During that time didnt see waitress once.  I actually found the pitcher of water to refill both my wifes and my water.  Food finally arrives and meh.  Not awful but not that good.  Overall it was the worst service I have received in a long time."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the happy hour is fun, with great chicken strips! They are hand breaded instead of poured out of a bag.  The draft selection is good, so I can usually find a tasty brew as well.  They also have a great patio, I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have a mug here. We love this place and have been back to it multiple times. The environment is awesome have a fire outside on the patio. Live music sometimes. Food is real good drinks are awesome. We will continue to come back here. We love this place."}
{"text":"If I could give  no stars I would! Horrible service and I had a gift card for $40 which could not even been redeemed! Don't go there..."}
{"text":"My first visit with great service and dueling pianos made me suggest this venue for a friend's birthday party. 

After reading some of the reviews about the mediocre service I questioned whether or not I made the best decision. 

I arrived approximately 2 hours after the remainder of the party and waited for what seemed to be 20 minutes after our server 'Mary\" arrived to take my iced tea order.    We experienced medicore service throughout the night and encountered members of the wait staff venting about how bad of the night they were going to have while hanging out on the patio. 

When \"Mary\" was asked about whether or not they still had dueling pianos she mentioned that they did and that she saw them out earlier that night.   When we advised her that there were no pianos on stage she mentioned that they only had dueling pianos on the weekends.   When we kindly informed her that it was Saturday she told us that she meant to say that she meant the weekend as in Thursday and Friday's before rushing off to \"go check\".

We never received an answer on the piano and never received more than subpar service.    Definately would probably look for a different bar next time I'm having a late night iced tea in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star.

Wife, son, and I go to Harvey House for a lite dinner and were seated outside.  We ordered drinks... iced tea was horrible... didn't taste like fresh brewed.  Beer was beer- that was probably the only good thing that happened at this establishment.  

Ordered food... pizza for my son, chicken wings and a salad for wife and I.  Guess how long it took to deliver these items to our table?  Nearly 1 hour later after seated, no food.  I asked the waitress a couple of times about the food, and she assured me it was busy, etc. etc., etc.

Chicken wings delivered over 1 hour later and were average at best.  Nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes, the salad was delivered and was average. Still NO children's pizza for my 5 year old.  Upon pestering the waitress multiple times, my child's pizza still not there. Two Hours into the experience, still no children's pizza.... after my son began to cry, we decided to solicit the waitress for our check... and to my astonishment the waitress decided to us a favor by not including my son's pizza on the check.  My wife and I left this establishment after nearly 2 1/2 hours upon seated.  My son still never received his crappy pizza.... After leaving Harvey House, I ordered a pizza at Geno's to get to my son... it took Geno's less than 15 minutes to cook that pizza.  My wife and I will never eat at Harvey House... Horrible service and average food.  Buyer Beware!"}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere and the food is delicious!! You can tell the chef and kitchen staff really care about what they're serving!"}
{"text":"My second visit tonight. While the beer is good it's all tap - so nothing original there. The appetizers are, well, gross. The sandwiches - highly overrated. 

The \"stage\" must be passed to get to the bathroom. Awkward - since the band is usually one to two people playing bad cover tunes. Plus - does the \"bands'\" children really need to sit at the table in front of the band? Band members - get a babysitter! 

By all means skip the hummus - chunks of stale bread in a basket with accompanied by babyfood. Ick. And Risotto Balls? Blech. 

Met an owner - Frank - total douchebag. Please, if you own the bar simple manners are in order. Maybe in NY people are treated poorly - but here in Gilbert we expect more. Skip this suck hole and go to Blue 32 next store.

Allow me to add more.... the \"owner\" had a \"party\" complete with balloons. When we congratulated them we were insulted - after spending nearly $100. In addition, someone in the \"owners\" party threw up all over the patio - near my table - with not so much as an acknowledgement. Rude, and unacceptable. So yes, douchebag and suck hole are appropriate. Plus - I don't care if you own the place - common courtesy to guest whether you are the owner or another patron should be common place."}
{"text":"I have been here four times. Great atmosphere. Great greeters who make you feel welcome right away. The chef is very inventive and seems to have a really great palate for food combinations. 

My husband is a hamburger fanatic and rates them all over phoenix. Their black and blue rates right up their with the best. Tasty, great seasoning and super juicy. He ventured  out and tried  a special burger  with  turkey and Applewood smoked bacon. Unbelievable! Should be on the regular menu. Hint, Hint! They have a special for a beer,  excellent fries and burger on Tuesdays,  for I think,  $8.99! 

Surprisingly,  the shrimp fettuccini was right up their with the best Italian restaurants. Their pesto pasta dish was just as good  heated up the next day. 

Don't listen to the others. The food here is really, really good. The servers are friendly, though  not pretentious and get the job done The prices are great. 

The patio is great! Even when it is hot. They are great at misting for the best effect. 
Also, I love the music though my hubby is their strictly to eat! Hah!

We are so glad this place is only 2 miles away! Lucky us!"}
{"text":"The place smelled like smoke right as we walked in the door. Ok beer list. Glass wine prices are high. Standard bar food."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here on a whim with friends, and am glad I did! Saturday evening, busy but not packed. Got a nice seat on the patio and had a great time. The noise level was just right, the drinks were strong and the food was terrific. Spencer (and all of the other waitstaff) were friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

My only real complaint was that the non-smoking area of the patio was not really enforced, and we had people standing five feet away who were smoking. It wasn't too bothersome because we were outside, but none of the staff seemed aware of it.

 I didn't see any signs of the problems reported in the lesser rated reviews, but I have only be there once so far. It's a good bet that I will be back, and if it is as good the second time, I could see this place becoming a regular happy hour spot for me."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was great!!!! Since then it has gone downhill. The food is decent, but my most recent visit, they were out of every draft beer we asked for. How does a bar run out of draft Coors Light as well as draft Miller Light and several others?????
Service was okay and my husband said the bathrooms were gross. I didn't bother to go in. My last visit was on a Sunday, it was dead and the service was still slow. Not to mention there was a girl at the bar  who was so drunk she ended up falling down in front of the bar and was slobbering all over customers. I can't believe they kept serving her.
Won't be going back. The $55 I spent on a couple of beers and some burgers would be better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Harvey. Between recommendations from a friend and the recent awesome Groupon deal, we've been there 3 or 4 times in the past few months and plan to continue. Thus far, the food has been fantastic, they have a nice, rotating craft beer selection, and always have interesting live entertainment. 

The service, while maybe slightly inconsistent during busy weekend times, is good overall. Our food has always been timed perfectly and never \"stacks up\" like chains are notorious for (entree arriving two minutes after the appetizer, etc), but it's sometimes been a bit of a wait for a fresh drink.

Probably my only real wish for the place would be the use of an electronic paging system. There isn't really a defined waiting area, so if you are waiting for a table and the bar is full (typical during peak times), you have to somewhat awkwardly linger in the small lobby or out front and hope that someone will come looking for you."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with a group.  The food was outstanding.  Best Ruben sandwich I have ever had.  The ham sandwich was equally delicious.  Everyone raved about the food they got.  We also had dessert, the tiramisu.  Loved it!  I will go back."}
{"text":"We've been to Harvey American a couple of times. I enjoy the outside patio but inside is nothing special. The food was fair and service too. When you go make sure you are prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here in April and it was great!

We had ribs, chicken with a cherry sauce, homemade fococia bread, salad - and it was all wonderful. We were able to reserve the patio which was the perfect size for us. Everyone was easy to work with and the chef did a tasting with us prior to the event so we could pick exactly what we wanted. The service the night of was great as well.

All our guests had only good things to say about this place too. It's a far drive for us from where we live, but if we're in the area, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The hubs and I have a weekly lunch date every Friday, and we try to find places we've never been, preferably locally owned joints instead of chains. It was my turn to pick, so we gave Harvey American a shot. What a pleasant surprise! It takes a lot for my husband to give high praise, and he said, \"My sandwich [the French dip] is excellent.\" Excellent in hubs' terms = the bomb! I had the chicken pesto flatbread and it was also excellent. The edges were crispy, the cheese was melty and flavorful, the chicken tender. Can't complain! But the crowning glory was the onion rings. Best I've EVER had. They are clearly hand-made, and it shows. The onions were sweet, and the coating was crisp and not greasy. When you take a bite, it doesn't fall apart. You get the bite, and the rest of the onion is left in the coating for the next bite. Imagine!

 Love the decor--all wood, very cozy, and next time I want to sit in one of the little hidden away booths. 

The only reason it gets 4 stars is because the food took quite a while to come out, even though the restaurant only had like 5 tables occupied, and because the country music was blaring. It was distracting. 

Overall, we'll be back. Definitely."}
{"text":"The drinks were okay. But service was absolutely awful... the bartender made us separate our own checks. We only had 4 people. He CLEARLY did not want to serve us. Refused to make a drink because it was \"too complicated\"... it was a mojito. Easy. we were his only table and we only got drinks. We had to stop him talking to his friends to make sure our tickets got taken care of. I was a server and my husband is a sous chef. I got a yelp to write this review because it was so terrible. It was our friend's birthday and treated him like crap... I couldn't believe it... it was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"The service here has been consistent and the food is great! If you like fish and chips they have an all you can eat special on Thursday! It's a fun atmosphere and they have plenty of room for large groups.  We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection which they rotate regularly.  The food is decent, burgers and risotto balls are excellent as well as the grilled chicken wings.  They often have good live music and the patio is a pleasant place to be when the weather is nice.  All in all a good local pub, especially for Gilbert."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A real bar in Gilbert that is open until 2am. I don't drink, but I have plenty of friends that like to chill out at night and socialize. There is live music, and a great happy hour almost every night here. Bartenders are good at what they do. Typical run of the mill bar for drinks. I haven't been able to try their food during earlier hours, but I had a decent time sitting on the patio. Just watch out for the typical gilbert douchebag guys who scream out \"no homo\" and get wasted while they fist pump to the live music... Create your own reality. Right?"}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing. They won't do beer samples, the beers I received were flat and their alcohol policy was way to strict and took my water bottle very rudely. The waitress was so rude. I will never return."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say. The food has ALWAYS been amazing but the service is night and day. The service we received today and the past 2 times has been excellent. Amazing servers, great beer and food. don't forget to try their onions rings, they are fantastic! ."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's so close to my house but the service is HORRIBLE! We are here on St. Paddys day, it's not busy and we wait 10 minutes for beer. Not to mention, the waitress seems clueless."}
{"text":"Harveys is a great place to meet up with family and friends, the food,the beer selection is phenominal, and the service is top notch! If you are lucky enough to get Mike as your server expect next level service!"}
{"text":"You know, I really want to like this place. The decor is nice, the patio very comfortable, even on hot evenings, it's in my neighborhood, and the food, when you finally get it, is good. 

The big problem I have is the terrible service. I've eaten here about 3 times and each time the service was terrible (very slow) and someone always had a problem with getting what they ordered. This past Tuesday we decided to give the $8.99 beer & a burger Tuesday special a try. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and at least 45 minutes for our food.  Our burgers were ordered rare & medium rare, one with no tomatoes. They both came out so cooked that we couldn't tell them apart (neither close to rare) and neither had tomatoes. We had to ask for silverware, napkins, S&P (that has been the case on every visit). There have been empty tables every time I've been there, so I can't chalk up the bad service to being super busy.

This could be one of my favorite restaurants if they would just get their act together with the service and stop messing up the orders. If you can finally get them to bring what you ordered, the food is good. Awesome onion rings, and the Reuben is delicious, great beer selection."}
{"text":"Went here with a group.  Service was spotty, we were all there at the same time but orders were taken individually, about 20 minutes apart.  Can they only make one dish at a time?  
Great selection of drinks.  Sandwiches were good but really fatty, some of them.  I can't remember what I had, but it was large and I needed to take half of it home afterward.  Looking around the table, some dishes looked fantastic, some ehhh.  
The appetizers are the best.  Mozzarella balls are pricey, get them at happy hour price, they taste great!
Bread plate with fig and hummus dipping bowls would be a close second.  
My recommendation is to go at happy hour for drinks and appetizers.  Expect to be there at least 2 hours and don't be hungry when you arrive."}
{"text":"Went here because friend of ours wanted to go here.
Our friend is leaving state & this is last time we will see him. Again, such a disappointment.   Our waiter was awesome, but the beer was not cold. After this I will absolutely  never go there again. - stars given if I could. This place needs to close!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! The service was awesome, Vern was the best - thank you for a great evening! Jalepeño marmalade rocks :-)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good beer selection and the food is great! I do wish the beer selection would rotate a bit faster, but I can always find something I love on tap so not a big deal.

The only issue I have is that, unless I'm sitting at the bar, there has been a couple instances of slow service. It's not as bad as others have said but it can happen. The food and beer selection definitely make up for any of that though.

Oh and check out the Prime Rib on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I Enjoy going to harvey's. They keep some of my fave beers always on tap and their rotating handles always have something new and fresh to try out. Service has always been good for me, I always sit at the bar. I see a rotation of three different bartenders and all have been very nice and accommodating. 

Try the three meat flat bread it is so good! Also they do \"taco wednesday\" Full order of tacos only 5 dollars. I got the carnitas and the meat was very good. I didnt like the salsa all that much but I am not a big salsa guy to begin with so my opinion might not be valid =p"}
{"text":"UPDATE: This past time was the second visit and the worst out of the two. The first time was pleasant enough. The patio has a great atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice. The beer selection is decent and the food is alright...depending on what you get. Last nights visit was with a sub par waiter that seemed to be across the board with the whole crew that was on. Everyone just seemed blah to be there. The live music was really, really good but unfortunately we sat in the bar and didn't get the nice patio/live music experience. I got the green chili chicken sandwich and he got the fish and chips. Both were just OK. *Tip: DO NOT order the meat/cheese board. It's $15 and just looks like someone ran out to Safeway and bought some packaged salami and pepperoni and cut it into quarters. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. After seeing all of the positive reviews on Yelp, I had high hopes and was anticipating the greatness of the food. Unfortunately, I was terribly wrong. 

After reading about the Risotto balls, I knew that's what I had to order for my appetizer. However, when I had ordered it, I was informed that they no longer make it- even though it was still listed on the menu; that was strike one! 

Next, I saw everyone raving about their nachos. That said, I ordered the nachos. Upon its arrival, I was shocked to find that the cheese appeared to had come from a bottle of Cheese Whiz and the sliced chicken came from a package you would find at a grocery store. Honestly, these nachos would be something that you would purchase from a movie theater- and those may actually be better. So, are these the BEST nachos I have had?? Absolutely NOT! Strike two!

We also ordered the chicken pot pie. Surprise, surprise...  it had great reviews on Yelp as well as from the server who raved about it. This entree was not TOO bad minus the fact that it had more breading than filling. With that said, I think that if they were to have more filling than crust, it would have been worth the price. Strike three!

Last but not least, we ordered a chicken tender plate off of the kids menu for my son. Disclosure- my son is not a picky eater at all! He struggled to eat these chicken tenders. Complaining that they were too salty and the breading was \"gross\". I was surprised to hear this from him because he is not one to complain about his food. So, I tasted it. I definitely would have to agree with him- it was awful! He picked off the breading and ate the chicken. I'm sorry but if my son won't eat the chicken tenders, that has to tell you something. Not to mention that a kids plate is $8.00- that is absurd! 

I never write reviews about anything but my level of disappointment with their food is too high to not let everyone know. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!"}
{"text":"I have tried Harvey's a couple of times because it is so close to my house but I am always disappointed by the service.

I went in late on a Friday to have some drinks with my girlfriends and our server was so incredibly rude. I was actually in shock. The food and drinks are average, but not worth sitting through the terrible service. You will be ignored, and when someone finally comes over, you will be treated terribly.

I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"What happened Harvey?? This place used to be a favorite of ours. We would take out of town guests here, and they would rave about the food, beer selections, and great prices. The last time we visited (October) the food was HORRIBLE. We always order the fish tacos, and normally they are the BEST. This time, every single ingredient was changed and it the quality was terrible. We also always order the onion rings as an appetizer, and this time they gave Ranch dressing as the dipping sauce instead of the homemade dipping sauce. All 6 of us who ate here that time thought the food was horrible. I'm giving this place 3 stars because I still love the atmosphere, the servers are always great, and the beer selection rocks. Something has gone horribly wrong in the kitchen, however."}
{"text":"I've never been here to eat just drink but the food was amazing! Strawberry salad and  burgers are awesome! Michael was fantastic loved the energy! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I try to be objective in any review I give...as well as open minded with any review I read. I have to say some reviews just make no sense at all unless of course they were for a totally different place than where I was at the time of this review. We had a great time at the Harvey American Public House this past Saturday....The Patio was full even after the rains have come through. The only thing I could say was that the crowd was not as a whole appreciating the band called the Mods...Not that they were bad mind you, they were actually really good. It seemed that the music is just a background for socializing conversations. Now about the food...I had the prime rib which was fantastic....this is the second time I visited this place and the hamburger I had then was tasty as well. Our bartender was knowledgeable on most things we asked but made sure he found out from someone else if he didn't know. This place is open until 2am 7 days a week. Where else can you go in Gilbert for a pint and a burger at 1am? This restaurant is owned by the people who own Fibber Magees Irish Pub in Chandler....good food, good staff....and good atmosphere. Im not sure what others consider to be a good experience....Everyone has their own agenda when writing a review. I consider the people factor as well, not everyone is going to be at their best 100% of the time. I am looking forward to many visits there as well as around the valley...Im out to support our local economy, one beer, one meal,....one day at a time! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had a wdge salad and Turkey club that was to die for.  Great patio seating for a mid day lunch.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The new menu is so great! Pork carnits tacos and beef pot pie.  They have also greatly improved their wine selection. Have added on tap wines.  This is one Very happy girl! I bought hubby a Mug club membership. 40$ for the year. Weekly discounts and food specials for mug club members. First fill free then all refills 20 oz for 16 oz price."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food (signature Reuben is my favorite) and they always have a great selection of beer on tap. The outdoor patio is a really nice space. Also, really enjoy the live music  and trivia night!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere, good times...awsome patio. new place still working out some kinks but overall best place in the area for a few drinks good food and some laughs"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome food and great staff. The patio is amazing to eat and relax. Love the live music on Saturdays and great service! Go to Harveys!"}
{"text":"Food is great, good beer selection, with knowledgeable bartender, . But skip if you think your going watch the game.  Usually have live music  on the nights I've stopped in.  I personally have liked their choice in entertainment in that it they have had quality talent in a setting that allows you to enjoy the music as well as the people you are with"}
{"text":"This place has the best outdoor patio in the East  Valley.  Inside was full so our choices were patio or wait.  I was a bit apprehensive because it was still well over 90 degrees.  Great misting system, so it was very comfortable to sit and hang out.  Were very pleased with the food--we had wings and the southwestern burger.  They have a good rotating selection of beer but they don't have it printed out, so, while the staff is very helpful in directing you to the type of beer you may like, I'm afraid they may lose some beer sales because people don't know everything they have available.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best nachos I've had. I liked them so much I bought a second order!

Nice atmosphere, especially for Gilbert."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8:30 on Wednesday night. They have a nice patio. There was live music and a pretty decent draft beer selection. Our waiter was really eager to please...maybe a little too eager, but overall nice. The food is unimaginative, bland, and overpriced. If you don't want to eat then Fox Cigar Bar a few doors down is better."}
{"text":"It's a 4.5 - I just feel guilty giving such a high rating when the first visit was not as great customer service-wise as it could have been. So I've been twice thanks to Groupon. Each time we have left stunned how much we enjoyed the food. Maybe because we are in Gilbert and you tend to lower your expectations when you dine in Gilbert? I'm not sure. Maybe it's just good. 

So my first visit I ordered the Cuban sandwich - AMAZING - pickle, pork yumminess. I loved it. My husband got the Rueben, typical except on a PRETZEL roll, pretzel people, it was incredible. My youngest got the chicken tenders and older got a flatbread pizza. My older was specific on what he wanted and not wanted on the flatbread it came out wrong so we had to send it back. Then my youngest got the chicken tender appetizer and not the kids meal which comes with fries. So they sent out a huge plate of fries which was really nice. The fixed the older kid's pizza and all was good.  We sat outside which was wonderful until people started smoking. Sigh, when will they learn that smoking is gross? 

So the second visit we sat inside. The decor is amazing, they must have spent a fortune just designing the place, wood, iron, stained glass. The wood benches became really uncomfortable after awhile but I forgot after the food came out. We ordered Stella Artois to start and they served them in Stella chalices nice touch! This visit I ordered the Reuben - it was great. The only issue was they used a lot of purple cabbage in the sauerkraut which was a bit bitter. I worked through it and enjoyed it completely. I also ordered the side salad instead of fries with ranch on the side. The ranch, holy moly the ranch. Thick, rich, garlicky heaven. The salad was so big, nice baby romaine and spinach, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and carrots. Enough about me. 

My husband got the Black n Bleu burger, he completely enjoyed it - ordered it medium rare and it came out almost perfect. The onion rings looked gorgeous, huge and lightly fried. The little one got the chicken again, the right one this time. Lightly fried chicken and good looking fries. The older one got the Three Little Pigs flatbread pizza. I guess he enjoyed it - it was gone in about 5 minutes. It's not small and neither is he. 

The service tonight was perfect. She was super attentive, gave us updates on the food, brought us water when needed, gave us background on the restaurant. The manager came by and asked how things were going. Exactly as it should be. 

All in all, I think this may be my new favorite place to eat in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Wonderful from scratch food and great atmosphere.  Live music weekly.  Amazing breakfast during football season and the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I actually accidentally walked in here on Tuesday. I was on the phone and was heading to Blue 32 and walked into this place not even realizing it was there!

I called my husband who was meeting me and told him to come here instead. It's only been open a few weeks so there is room for improvement but overall, a great start and lots of potential to work with!

The inside is really nice, lots of wood and gives a pub feeling. The patio is awesome. Big and well-appointed. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Good beer list (Left Hand and Moosedrool were present). The menu is.....odd...I think it's because they're trying to figure out what will sell and do well but pasta with burgers with pork sandwiches with hummus? The Italian thing sort of doesn't jive with the public house thing and it confused me.

Husband had the jalepeno burger and it was both well-cooked and tasted great. Fries were good, as well. I had the pork sandwich with the mashed potatoes. Both were good but weren't hot. They were warm....I heated them up the next day for lunch and it was better when hot. Also, PJ, the bartender was super friendly and came out and talked to people.....except for us......he was chatting here and there but apparently, we didn't warrant a visit. Not a huge deal if it was busy but we were one of three tables on the patio....so to be overlooked was pretty damn obvious. Guess we're not part of the \"regular\" crew for a place open two weeks. My guess? Those people obviously know the owners or something but still, rude. So much so, we opted not to sit at the bar after our meal and get a drink. 

I will come back because I want a place like this to do well and I hate the freaking douchebag sports-wannabe parents over at Blue 32 but right now, I'd say Blue 32 is winning in the food department.....But I think this place can and will do better as it works out the kinks. And hopefully, PJ will come say hi to everyone and not just his personal favourites.

As for parking, we didn't have a problem. Just parked around the corner near the vacant office space."}
{"text":"After reading reviews about Harvey's American Public House we were hesitant to give it a try....but we went for dinner this evening and were not disappointed at all! We were seated immediately and after placing our order our beverages were served quickly and our glasses were never half-empty! Colton provided excellent service and recommended the onion rings....they were not greasy and were really good. We also ordered the French dip sandwich, the Cuban sandwich and the margarita flatbread pizza. Portions were good size and we took 3 boxes home. They offer a lot of different brews and have sports playing on several flat screen TV's. we really enjoyed the atmosphere, their delicious food and excellent service......definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and it was just OK. Bought a Groupon and tried it again. Mediocre at best. Great looking place, awesome patio but it all ends there. There is no passion here. Service is not attentive and the food is just not very good. Onion rings were good. This place needs to take a look around and see why their neighbors are always busy and they are not. It became evident to us tonight."}
{"text":"I will give the food 4 stars and the service about a 1-2 star. I will go back often because I love the food. I have only been at  late lunch time and there is usually 1 server there. Its not usually busy at that time. It usually takes a while for food to arrive, even on a slow day. Not sure why.. The Salads are good, Burgers are great and yummy grilled chk wings.
If this place would step up there service standards I think theyd do better. Theyre open late night so thats a plus for some. Great patio set up with misters..

Will suffer bad service for the good food, but most people wont."}
{"text":"By far one of our favorite places to meet friends for drinks. Staff is friendly, attentive and they have a great Happy Hour! My favorite is their extensive list of brews on draft: Over 30!!! Almost impossible not to find something new that you will love! Heck, I discovered a Lost Coast Watermelon Wheat!! Freaking delicious for a fruit infused wheat beer!

Our favorite dish was the chicken pot pie. A huge bowl covered with flaky delicate crust of deliciousness! Way yummy! We've become regulars for the Wednesday Bingo Trivia and keep coming back for the great service and food. 

Alas, perfection has an ending. After years of fine food and drinks, Harvey's has closed down. Very honored to have retired as Harvey's Yelp Duke.."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. Food, beer and band always an A+  New waitress, Sarah is very good too!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Harvey's last night!  \"Cheers\" type experience thanks to \"Frank\" and the clean, cozy atmosphere. He remembered our names and preferences even though we hadn't been in for a while!  Ask for the fries extra crispy, no seasoning salt, yummy! DBacks were on TV, and ZERO smoking at the bar! Thank you, \"Harvey\" and the folks who took their smoking to the misted outside patio. It made a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is bad.  Have been here twice...both times our order was screwed up.  The second time we received no apology.  Wait staff is reactive instead of proactive.  Food is decent but expect more for the money.  I really wanted to like this place but I have been given too many reasons to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't had one bad thing on the menu! The risotto balls and grilled chicken wings are our favorites!"}
{"text":"Very nice Ruben and Cuban sandwiches.  Beer selection is good.  Real chicken fingers.  The patio is awesome.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We go here for dinner with a large group and they are so welcoming. The servers are on point, the beer selection is large and the food is really good!

If you have a crowd request their back room to accommodate and try one of their apricot beers!"}
{"text":"I drive out of my way to get eat here on the weekend...I like to start here with some beer... (they have a fantastic selection of IPA's etc...).  The Patty Melt is top notch and so is the menu... which is a notch and a half above what you would expect.  This is really good food.  Service is very professional.  Prices are what you would expect, this isn't a dive bar by any means.  (not that there is anything wrong with that!)"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to hang out weekdays. 3-7pm happy hour. Great service warm fireplace."}
{"text":"This review only pertains to the restaurant side of Harvey American, I did not visit the bar.  

I've eaten places high class to home cooking, good food and bad food; Harvey American is the only place I've ever felt insulted.  

The evening started off well, the decor is a neat little mix between English public house and American saloon, it really gives the place a unique feel.  The wait staff were friendly and the wait time wasn't too long.  At first glance this place looked like the fabled Friendly Neighborhood Local Eatery that makes you happy you live near by.  

This fantasy came to an abrupt conclusion when the food arrived.  The first hurdle was ordering something off the menu that did not have their signature rub (which tastes like K.C. Masterpiece).  Its on the fries, on the bun, and mixed into the burger, I ordered a burger exclusively because it was the only one that didn't call out the rub.   My fiancee ordered the baby back ribs, and to round out the order at a new place we ordered the risotto ball appetizer and a cup of soup as well.  

The risotto balls came out and were interesting, they had that signature spice but were a refreshing change from the usual fair.  When the meal arrived the first thing i noticed was that the rub was, infact, on everything I ordered, fries, bun, in the burger, on the ribs, and the food was shockingly bland (yes even the ribs), the end result was that everything from appetizer to burger to ribs tasted exactly the same, in addition everything had almost the same consistency.  I was left with the distinct feeling they were trying to hide the food behind the rub.  

The final straw was the soup, it didn't make it to our table when the rest of the food arrived, but when it did it made quite the entrance, I've never had soup that at a glance could be confused with instant flaked mashed potatoes before, but being a fan of flavor first and foremost, I dug in anyway.  The soup was solid.  The soup was so solid I stuck my spoon in it and it remained upright.  I brought up my soup concerns to the server, who informed me it was supposed to be like that.  I then turned the bowl upside down and neither the soup nor the spoon moved, the server took the bowel and left, some time later she returned, apologized, and said that this had never happened before.  

Harvey, I wanted to like you, but I couldn't help but notice you were hiding things from me."}
{"text":"I put off writing this review for awhile.  You know how go you somewhere for the first time and get great service, great food or whatever and your not sure if it was just a good day for that business or if that's how it always is?  That's why I put it off.  The first time my wife and I went we had great service and the food we had was awesome.  We started with the pretzel bites.  They were awesome.  They reminded me of one of our favorite hot pretzel places that we use to go to.  Unfortunately it has since gone out of business, year and years ago, but I still miss the way those pretzels were cooked and how they tasted.  These took me back to that time, they were awesome.  The cheese dip was good but nothing special, then again it wasn't back then either.  I highly recommend them.  I had the grilled wings with the hot sauce and blue cheese.  They don't toss the wings in the sauce (they will if you want), which I normally really like, but I ordered them just how they serve them.  They are advertised as grilled on the menu but I believe that they are probably grilled then deep fried or vise versa.  They were crisp and juicy and the house seasoning that they use was great.  My wife had the chicken strips and house cut fries.  These are not your normal strips.  You can tell they are made from a real chicken breast, hand breaded and deep fried.  They are also delicious.  The fries are hand cut and seasoned with their house seasoning, they are very good. The second time we went we both had the wings but sub fried pickles for pretzel bites.  This was one reason I gave 4 stars and not 5.  I love fried pickles but some places really over-bread them where other places barely use any.  There is a fine line between good and failure.  These I feel were a failure.  The breading was way to thick and unfortunately soaked up a lot of the grease.  Several pieces that were in the basket were nothing more than pieces of breading with no pickle - just not a fan.  This last time we went my wife had the strips again and I had the Rueben.  Not your traditional Rueben but at least they used corned beef and not pastrami.  This Rueben used house made coleslaw instead of sauerkraut and a pretzel bun, not rye.  It was different but also delicious.  The sandwich came with house made potato chips dusted with the house seasoning.  They were good, crisp and flavorful.  This time the strips were slightly over cooked and a couple of them had a burnt taste that was very off-putting.  My wife said the 3 she ate were delicious, it was just that the last two were burnt - the other reason for 4 and not 5 stars. We will definitely go back, we want to try the fish fry.  The service has been on point all 3 times.  The beer selection is also extensive, if trying different things is your forte."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate two of my friends birthdays and watch the basketball game. Got a nice table with a perfect view of the tvs. Unfortunately the service was poor. The gentleman who served us was nice and seemed to be trying but was forgetting our ordered constantly. I asked for water twice and never received it. 

Do not eat the happy hour nachos or tacos. First off they're $5.99 and taste like a child put them together. The nachos had something similar to cheese whiz on them with raw whole chunk tomatoes dropped on top sprinkled with pepper. Okay? Tacos were tiny with almost no flavor. 

Next time I'll just go next door and receive better food and service."}
{"text":"Too expensive!!!  We had the Risotto balls and Harvey chips. Chips were great but overpriced...same with risotto!  Laura was awesome though!!"}
{"text":"I meet a group here every other Sunday night and we love it so much we just keep coming back. The patio is really great with a big fire pit and live music. The music is stopping for the next month or so since it is soooo cold but should be back in the spring. Happy hour specials even on the weekend with discounted apps and drinks. They have a really great craft beer selection including nitro beers. The service for the large party is always great which is a bonus! They have trivia on Wednesday nights and I haven't been yet but will by trying it out in January. 

My favorites so far here are the garlic fries, fried pickles, Murphys draft, and nachos. The risotto balls are also good and the fish tacos are good. I really haven't had anything bad! But the garlic fries I actually crave during the week! They are that good. They have 3 different varieties of seasoning for the fries as well but I can't get past trying the garlic ones! Great spot in Gilber and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have to agree with those giving this place One Star.  I have no idea who is giving the five star ratings-- friends of the owners? 

  Our service was horrific.  We ordered a chicken salad sandwich with no mayo on the bread.  What was made was a chicken breast on bread.  The kitchen remade the sandwich and it was awful.  The chicken was not seasoned and swimming in mayo.  Remember, we ordered it with no mayo on the bread for a reason.  We know that there will be some mayonaise in the sandwich for a binder, but did they need to use the entire jar (bottle?) in the sandwich?  We also received the wrong side-coleslaw which was also swimming in mayo.   They did bring the requested fries.  They were not hot and lacked salt.

  We also saw who appeared to be the owner(s) chatting away.  Again, no greeting of guests, welcoming to the new place.    

  My husband ordered a Grey Goose Martini--- $12?!?!?!??!   This is Gilbert for goodness sakes.    I think that he told me that next door at Blue 32, they sell for $8 or even Brio at Santan has good martinis for less. 

  We have been watching and waiting for this place to open for a while.  We were really hoping that it would be a nice alternative in the East Valley for a place to go for a relaxing drink and maybe grab a bite to eat.      We were told that the grand opening is in two weeks.  We will give it another chance in a month or so hoping that the issues noted have been ironed out, understanding that a new place is going to have problems.  Maybe waiting until the kitchen staff was completely trained or at least knew where the seasonings were kept would have been a good idea before opening."}
{"text":"Food was good, big beer selection, and the patio was nice.  Unfortunately the atmosphere was brought down by the presence of smokers. This should probably be a 3.5 or 4 but the smokers really bring it down to a 3."}
{"text":"Just sat down outsude. Ordered a cosmo and margarita. Took a bit. Waitstaff is friendly as is the host staff. Took our order immediately, chicken wings, Caesar salad and fish n chips. Food came quickly and very hot, chicken wings for well seasoned well cooked and the sauces served were delicious fish chips were also delicious came with a mountain of fries coleslaw and tartar sauce, we will return. Drinks were well made and delicious ,well priced too."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. Had some issues with service in the past, but they seem to have weeded out the struggling servers. Live music on Saturdays, sometimes on the patio, sometimes inside. Our own local Carvin Jones even plays there frequently! I used to hate the place, but my friends and i have come back here often over the past few months. TONS of craft beers and the food has always been phenomenal. (tried to review a short time ago, but it disappeared)"}

{"text":"Okay this is going to be a bifurcated review.

For dining - a 3.
For drinking - a 4.

Start with the dining experience.  I had heard good things about this place so when that Groupon appeared, I jumped on it.  So the DH, DS, and I headed down on a Wednesday for dinner.

The place was busy and it was 113 out so let's just say we were  taking that inside table, even though it was at the front door.  Note to hostess:  if you are going to have front doors that stick open, then don't seat people at that front table - or rather than stand there with nothing to do, shut the freaking door yourself.  The blasts of hot air probably are some of the most memorable moments of that night.

My DH had not even gotten butt in chair before the server asked for drink orders (seriously, he was still standing!).  Uh, can we have a minute please.

Big mistake. We watched the server hop past us no less than 12 times (I started counting out of boredom) before he returned to take our order or even acknowledge our existence.  But finally he returned.

The beer selection is admirable.  The DH enjoyed an Alaskan Amber and started his bucket list of some other beers there on tap he wants to return and enjoy.

I however found it disappointing that in an establishment that boasts about its décor and ambiance and great food, that they only have fountain iced tea, nothing brewed.  Really?  Quite sad. I expect that from a cheap joint, not a nicer one. Oh wait - that's right - even McD's and Wendy's have fresh brew....

Being ravenous and having a big Groupon, we ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, and an entrée salad.

And bets were taken - would the appetizer appear before the entrees.....

The server brought the guys their salads - it was a cute moment as he asked which one got the balsamic then gave him the  Caesar anyway. yeah, I know, hard to tell them apart.

The dinner salads were served with 1/2 a pretzel roll.  The salads were large but nothing special. The house salad came with few \"extras\".  The Caesar was just a Caesar, nothing special like thinly sliced Parm.

Okay, now the curiosity is getting more intense - salads before appetizer.....would the appetizer make it before the entrees?It did - but just barely.  We had not even eaten a single wing before the entrees were served.

The wings had a nice rub on them and the sauces were not bad although it was hard to tell the difference between the BBQ and the Chipotle BBQ.  But grilling those wings can really dry them out - that was rather disappointing.  The other thing that was so odd - most wing places will split the wing between the joint, nice and clean.  Here, we found ourselves with bones cut off - which I found odd and a little messy but so be it.

DH ordered the grilled chicken with the cherry demi-glace.  Again, it sort of missed the spot - the chicken had an opportunity for a nice rub but really just didn't stand up on its own for taste.  he had subbed out the 3 sisters ragout for the potatoes.  We were surprised that the ragout was comprised of white beans and corn - usually when you think of a veggie ragout, it is more along the lines of squash and carrots and tomatoes.  next time, ask before subbing.

DS ordered the crispy skin salmon.  It was not served medium rare as it should be. but he said it was tasty.  he had subbed out the broccolini for the grilled asparagus.  of course, he received both.

interestingly enough, they brought DS the asparagus as a side dish so he received about 3x as many spears as did DH did as part of his dinner.  oops.

Now to my entrée salad.  I ordered the Strawberry Salad and added grilled shrimp.  I asked for the salad without the bleu crumbles and dressing on the side as I don't like much dressing.  My salad came - imagine this - dressed with some cheese in it but it was so tiny and almost hidden - almost as though the greens had belonged to another's salad and just was used for mine instead. now I hate to think that - but the onion flavors in the salad which would not have had onion in it to begin with made me wonder more.  The salad had what appeared to be frozen berries, not fresh berries - or maybe they were marinated but not fresh. and, to be honest, my salad was no bigger than the side salad that the guys received.  but that cheese bugged me - if I had a lactose issue or allergy rather than a dislike of bleu, that salad might had ruined my evening.  The shrimp added on were nice in size but a tad overgrilled as they were somewhat tough, but grilling shrimp when you are busy - I can forgive that.

Not once during the meal did water get refilled - again, not a biggie but since that was my only beverage, well, it was a biggie for me.

All in all, I think I would go back for happy hour and drinks. But I don't see myself returning for dinner anytime soon.  Too many other places do it better."}
{"text":"A place that serves lots of beers and looks like more of a bar, you would think it would have just bar food.  Its the opposite.  Their food is just freaking fantastic.  Have been in many times, and every dish ordered has been amazing.  Love the ribeye sandwich. No complaints for me."}
{"text":"Can I just tell you how sorely Harvey American is needed in Gilbert? A good bar with yummy food that's open until ***2 AM*** SEVEN DAYS A WEEK! Sorry to shout, but I've lived in Gilbert a long time.

We came with our family (a party of 9) early Saturday night, and we got seated right away.  I liked the high booth seating, mostly because I'm pretty short. There's also regular seating around barrels closer to the bar. 

Our server Audra really took care of our group. She had a friendly, upbeat attitude, and she sincerely apologized for a couple minor snafus (missing water, late entree). She did an excellent job. 

We got pretzel rolls to the table right away and tore right through them. The second batch came out even hotter-- you could see steam when you cut into them. I loved them, but my husband though they could use a bit more salt. Can't argue with that. 

I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband is. He was really pleased to see Moose Drool and Guinness on tap. I like that they have happy hour until 7pm all week.

I was hoping to try the black bean burger that my sister had at their soft opening, but sadly, it wasn't on the menu. I instead got the strawberry salad that came with romaine, candied pecans, dried cherries and gorgonzola. It was delicious, and the raspberry dressing was just the right amount of sweet. The side salads were also pretty impressive considering the sad examples I've seen at other places. My sister-in-laws loved the house-made ranch because it reminded them of their mom's dip.

The meat eaters were all pretty happy. My father-in-law thought his pot roast sandwich was just ok, but my brother-in-law was a big fan of his stuffed jalapeno burger. My husband, who normally only likes steaks cooked by himself or my dad, loved his ribeye. He also went on and on about how flavorful the side veggies were. I guess living with a vegetarian is finally starting to rub off on him.

My husband said we are definitely coming back. I hope they add a few more vegetarian options in the mean time."}
{"text":"The food came, they just forgot the flavor!  Manager asked if everything was okay, we said no, since one of our guests didn't get her food....well the manager barely cared 
 
BEWARE!!!! They charge you 50 cents for every sauce!  That sounds like a business that is struggling financially....and I can see why, they won't be getting me as a repeat customer. 

We are normal nice people and all four in our party were actually mad at the customer service, not to mention the quality of their food, especially their portions. 

If you don't want to wait at blue 32 next door, don't make our mistake and go here. I can only assume that this is the reason for half their customer base."}
{"text":"I went with a friend last night. We had not yet been to this newish restaurant in Gilbert and were hoping for another nice place we could go to to escape the plethora of chain restaurants out here. 
The parking lot was packed as was the large patio. This was a good sign, right? Unfortunately, we couldn't tell you. There was a minor wait so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar while waiting.  Upon sitting at our table, our waitress comes over and notices our drinks. We ask for waters and I ask if they had a gluten free menu. She said no. No big deal, I've been to countless restaurants and have always found something on the menu. So, I asked if she knew what was prepared gluten free. She stated someone else had asked her that before and she recalled the pork chop probably was. She said she would go back and double check with the kitchen. Great!  She came back a minute later to tell us, it turns out that the only thing on the menu that was gluten free was their salads.  Anyone who does not eat gluten knows that one of the biggest culprits for hiding it is salad dressing which I'm guessing was probably not made in house, so the likelihood of the chef knowing for sure was making me skeptical. I looked down at my menu and pointed out they had lots of meat dishes. I asked if I could just get a plain steak or the aforementioned pork-chop or  something with veggies. She said no, everything has sauces. What!?! So, you put gravy on all of your meat??? At this point we are certainly questioning the quality of the food but also the knowledge of the staff. Since we were starving I decided to give it one more go and asked if the chef could work with me on something. She responds with a sarcastic and condescending tone, \"well, what do you want, just a big piece of meat?\" This is not rocket science folks!  I have never experienced this type of rude condescending attitude regarding my dietary needs. We, obviously, did not stay and left to go to one of their competitors who happily accommodated us and will continue receiving our business."}
{"text":"So the bartender was busting her butt trying to get to everyone.  The owner is too cheap to staff accordingly for a football Sunday.  1 cook & 2 servers, one that didn't show up, and 1 bartender to take care of a full house.  I've had to send my food back because it was cold and super greasy.  I've seen now 10 people get up and walk out without being served,  and the bar needs a good cleaning with bleach, it's sour from lack of maintenance. Overall probably will be a cold day in hell before I come back. The manager was very apologetic and was doing her best to work with what she had. Bartender/manager A for effort. Harvey's owner fail."}
{"text":"We came here to get away from Downtown Gilbert on a Friday night, and were pleasantly surprised. It was more crowded than we expected and parking was pretty tough, but we got two seats at the bar right away, and enjoyed our BBQ chicken flatbread and french dip. Our food took a while to come out but I can tell it was a fluke because everyone was VERY apologetic when they realized and rushed to get our food. We'll definitely be back (almost went this Sunday but I decided it would be a madhouse on a football day)!"}
{"text":"Staff is always pleasant and food is delicious!!  Love that the express lunch is served with kettle chips and French onion dip.. Nice touch!! Great selection of beers on draft as well!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was great.  But more importantly, as a fellow business owner, there are many ways we can pay back the community that supports us. Charities are great, hosting fundraisers, sponsoring Little League teams, whatever floats your boat. But one of the little things Harvey American does is \"Paul's Corner.\" Paul is a veteran of WWII and Korea who frequents Harvey's, and they thank him for his service the right way every time he comes in.

If you get a chance, say hi to Paul and listen to his stories. You won't regret it.

Thanks to the owners and staff. That's how you do it."}
{"text":"Went here early on a sunday. Not many people there and we sat down right away. You seat yourself prior to 5pm. The waitress was nice and our drinks were good. 

Got steak nachos that came up $10 but menu said $6. They were good. The fried egg burger was ordered medium well and it arrived well done. Just eating the burger meat tasted very bland and dry. Terrible patty, the toppings made the burger to where i could eat some of it.

Avoid the seasoned fries! They smell weird and taste way too strong. Just has poor flavor.

Turkey club was stated to be decent, but after getting the bill, we did not feel it was worth it.

This is a great place for drinks and appetizers, but is not somewhere I would go for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Good:  The drinks.  Bad:  The service, the staff and, ultimately, the food.  

What a shame!!!  Such a disappointment!!!

If you want to be ignored by the servers, insulted by the management, disappointed by the food, harrassed by drunk/high kitchen staff and have all the friends and acquaintances you invited to dinner leave upset, then this is the place for you!

I won't go into detail like I typically do with my other reviews, but let me say that the owners of Harvey American Public House need to take a LOOOOOONNNNGGGG, hard look at the inner workings of this establishment.  Gathering the staff for a \"respect the clientelle\" pep talk and mandatory drug screening wouldn't be a bad start!  

No one from my party will venture here again.  I recommend anyone else considering a visit to the Harvey American Public House to stay away, as well."}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere at night. Nice patio too. The food is great. They took away the live music at one time but now it appears to be back. Lots of tvs too to watch sports. This is a nice bar to go too if you want to go somewhere not packed with wall to wall people. If Blue 32 is packed next door then come here."}
{"text":"The food here is EXCELLENT!!  The place is new, so it's still a little disorganized, but everyone here is very friendly and goes out of their way to accommodate you and your party.  It was nice to see one of the owners (Jim) running around and making sure everyone was getting taken care of."}
{"text":"I don't know... We went in there one night and we waited a really long time for drinks.  The food was just ok.  Didn't really feel wowed. I tried the wings because that's what the chef was known for.  Not to be insulting, they just weren't anything to write home about.  They were salty and dried out.  Salty was not a great leading characteristic.  It was a little disappointing.  Everyone was nice enough, but I just wasn't that impressed.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday night. Food was decent but I was expecting better based on reviews.  They could kick it up a notch. Beer selection is decent but there is better very near here. The patio is the best thing this place has going for it.  They're trying I guess."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Multiple bad experiences.  Manager is a jerk, staff is incompetent, and the food is downright awful."}
{"text":"Overall I give this place 2 stars because the furniture we sat in was rickety so we requested to move. The table and bench seat rocked severely and I thought I was going to collapse it just by sitting. I ordered the Three little pigs flatbread, the flatbread was like a cracker, the marinara had no flavor and the sausage was dry. My husband ordered the fish and chips and the fries were overcooked. This was our second time here , the first time was on a Sunday for lunch and it wasn't great, but being a pubhouse we thought we'd try it on a Saturday night instead. No improvement, so I will not return ."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great service!  Love this place. The first time I visited there was an incredible singer performing. I plan to visit a lot!"}
{"text":"The Pub is THE place!  It has become our new go to for dining out.  Everyone we take, just loves this place.  The patio is nice and breezy during hot days, but warm and cozy during cold ones.  They have happy hour 7 days a week and daily specials.  The have a HUGE draft selection from all over the world. Their beer menu is easy to read with accurate descriptions of each craft beer and scores.  They beer selections changes, so there is always something new and exciting to try. Other cocktails, I don't personally order that often (I prefer to try their beer selection), but all their drinks are made from scratch with fresh fruits, juices and ingredients.
They also have a different feature menu every week, which the only times I am disappointed is when they run out and I can't try it.  Their wings are also worth trying, they are grilled! All sauces are on the side (my 9 year old loves them and orders them as a meal -comes with carrots and celery so you get your veggies).  If you don't know what to order, you can't go wrong with their fish n' chips, even if you are not a fish person.  (our kids always make a face when we order them, but can't stop eating it once we get them).  I don't know why people complain about service.  Staff is always friendly and patient.  Food arrives hot and delicious every time.  Cool music in the background but not too loud so talking and hanging out with friends is always fun and relaxing.  Key Word: RELAXING!!! This is the type of place you come to sit down, watch a game, listen to music, sip on some good beer and munch on some good food while catching up with friends."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. We didn't like it the first time, but like to support local restaurants instead of the big chains, so we decided to go back. We didn't like it the second time either. The service is fine, atmosphere is fun, food is lacking big time! I want to like this place but I just can't give it more than 2 stars...."}
{"text":"So unique! Daily specials. Great beer & wine list but the best is the service! Old pub, old American and the patio is great! Inside \ outside bar."}
{"text":"So, we were having dinner at Blue 32 and noticed the cool patio and fire pit next door so we came over for drinks. The service was terrible, not once did anyone come take our order and we had to go to the bar every time. Since we were ordering at the bar we closed out every bill. The only time anyone came to our table was to tell us that we left an open tab, which we did not. The nice patio can't make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon hoping to have found a new regular place, left sure in my knowledge that I had not.  I had the ahi salad.  It sounds good in print - arugula, pickled grapes, orange slices, topped with panko crusted ahi...  The truth is that arugula is a pain to eat on its own - long skinny leaves that are mostly stem.  I like the taste, but a whole plate of it is a bit messy.  Besides that, the ahi was a little tired - tasted fishy.  I powered through, knowing I needed to get some vitamins for the day. My wife had the turkey club on pretzel bun.  Again, another winner on paper.  We both tried it and could never put a finger on what was wrong with this sandwich.  Individually, the ingredients tasted fine, but together they added up to a poor ingredient combination.  I wish I could be more specific.  It's one of those cases of just taking a bite of something and saying, \"Nope, not that.\"  As far as the setting goes, I thought the TVs were a little loud.  At least the joint next door has the decency to keep the games at a reasonable volume.  On the bright side, the service was acceptable."}
{"text":"This is a great hang out spot...live music, a real nice tap selection for beer, friendly wait staff, and the food has been very consistent."}
{"text":"Wednesday night, trivia.  Had a good time.  Food was good.  Had mushroom bisque that was delish and a wedge salad.  Husband had a reuban but didn't come with kraut???  What the??  Sat inside but could still smell all the smokers at the outside seating. Turn off!!"}
{"text":"have been looking forward to this place for quite a while now and finally made it.   sat outside with my wife on the patio and enjoyed some great beers.  our service was really good but our entree was not.  we ordered the jalapeno and cheese stuffed burger and ordered it well done.  took about thirty minutes to get it but they were pretty busy.  anyways,,,,,here is my complaint.  the burger was not stuffed with anything.  it was simply a VERY SMALL patty with lettuce and mayo.  we split the burger so when it arrived it was already cut in half.  you would think that when the cook cut this WELL DONE burger in half he/she would have noticed it was still bleeding!  it was beyond medium rare! our server had informed us that there has been quite a few mistakes due to just opening doors recently.  he handled the situation very well.
we will go here again but are most likely going to wait a couple months for them to work out the problems.  i hope that is enough time.
pros:  awesome fries....beer selection......service
cons:  the food and parking"}
{"text":"Breakfast News! If you go in to the Deli for breakfast, I recommend asking for Eugene who cooks up a fantastic Bacon Cheddar Omelet Breakfast Sandwich. Ask for is \"Mr Stew\" Style. It'll rock your world!"}
{"text":"We arrived a couple minutes before 6pm to the happy surprise that Happy Hour went until 7pm. I enjoyed very tasty carne asada tacos for the HH price of $5. My friend had a turkey club sandwich. It was huge and served on a pretzel bun. While tasty, it was so big it was hard to eat. The cocktails were good (margarita, blood orange margarita and...something we no longer remember the name of). Our service was very good. Christian was wonderful plus two others would stop by to check on us. We enjoyed the pub ambiance and were pleasantly surprised to learn everything (including pasta) is made in the kitchen. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's hard to read bad reviews on this place, especially when people state they had slow service. I always feel like they have too many people working. I haven't had a bad experience!  The Deli has great sandwiches during the day. And yes the fries has a seasoning on it and I personally love it. And of course their beer options are awesome.  Live music random nights, can get loud but that's why they have an awesome patio! It's a fun place to be at!"}
{"text":"Great service always friendly and welcoming! The patio is always pleasant! It would be a lot better if they made it all non smoking. Who wants to eat a burger well the table next to you is smoking up a storm and your stuck breathing it in! The wings are good but the burgers are great!"}
{"text":"After previewing the reviews prior to our trip, I was a bit skeptical to give this place a try. We arrived on a Sunday around noon with a group of twelve to a fairly empty restaurant. Our server, Zoe, promptly adjusted seating to accommodate our group. We were very pleased with Zoe throughout the entire meal. No order mistakes, she kept with the drink refills, and even remember the condiment requests without any having to re-ask. I had the Ruben sandwich, which is a bit non-traditional but still very tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. I originally want to try the chicken pot pie but discovered those are not served until after 3pm. Again, Zoe was very polite in describing the reasoning behind that decision. Bottom line is that I would definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Stopped in to hear a friend musician performing on a Friday night. With the lack if venues with music, finding one that is not a dive is a pleasure. The facility is in a very nice strip mall in a good area of town. This a local business and not a franchise or national chain. The bar and dining area is well done and they also have an outdoor patio with heaters. The staff was very attentive and friendly, making us feel right at home. They have a small but nice selection of craft beers and wine selections. We ordered some food from the night menu which is a downsized version of their regular offerings. I ordered the chicken tenders. The price was 8.99 for a pound of food. I have had this staple at many other establishments. What you expect are the breaded planks of chicken. When the waitress delivered my order not only was it enough food for 3 people, but, they were some if the best pieces of chicken I have ever had in a bar. They were moist, tender and the breading they used was excellent. I am waiting for my next visit to sample some of the other menu items to determine if this was a fluke or a normal occurrence.  If other items are as well prepared as the tenders, this will turned into 5 star rating, which for me is rare.  They have a Thursday night all u can eat fish fry for 9.99. Will give that one a try."}
{"text":"Decided to try someplace new last night. The reviews looked fair except one that talked about the terrible service. We thought we would try anyway. We were told there was a wait for a tables, which was fine. Sooner than expected, we were told our table was ready. We sat 5 minutes and were never greeted, offered anything to drink or acknowledged by a server. My husband stopped a server and asked if we had one assigned to our table. The guy looked frazzled and said yes he would be right there. We waited another few minutes and nothing. We got up and walked out and went next door to Blue 32 Grill and had great service and a very nice meal. 
My husband worked in the restaurant business for many years, so he understands the expectations of management and how to provide good service. So, when we go out to eat, initial acknowledgement by a server is pretty much on a timer with him. When we are going to spend money someplace decent service is huge and this place lost."}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever tasted. I didn't think I liked wings much, but I tasted these and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Decided to have a family night out.  We really enjoyed the high tables.  The food was great, loved the fried pickles and pretzel buns.  They even had a free little holiday treat for the kids."}
{"text":"Drove by dozens of times and finally stopped in.  Walked in the front door and first impression was \"Oh Ya\" nothing fancy, light woods and inviting.  Sat outside in the patio next to the fountain. the patio, on the east side of the building so the sun was not ontop of us, lots of trees and plants, soothing confortable place and we can smoke.  We had the meat and cheese board, very good.  Large selection of beer and also a orange blood margarita, very good.  We will for sure be going back.  Would like to try the burgers."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outdoor patio and the inside is very authentic and cozy. Service is great and the chicken pot pie is amazing!"}
{"text":"My friends and i stopped in to have some
lunch and we were quite impressed!  From the service to the amazing food! Best nachos I've ever had (they use nacho cheese, not shredded cheese). My French dip was tasty, and the portions are huge!! Prices are fair. Wish they had one of these in Vegas! I'm still craving those nachos and I want to go back!!"}
{"text":"Tried the fried egg burger. Delicious!  My wife and I are really starting to like this place. I would recommend giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is about right...

I really wanted to like this place.... When we walked in there was sign that said \"please seat your self\", so we bellied up to the bar. We sat there for just few mins waiting for the bartender to come out of the kitchen.... Whatever. It wasn't busy by any means. I do like the beers on tab, however a little out of season for most of them. I can't drink heavy beer during the summer. The menu was small and not really what I was expecting. I ordered the Cajun burger... \"Meh\" is a good word this too. It came with the 2 tinniest onion rings I have seen, and they immediately fell off. The flavor was kinda strange... not gonna lie. I was starving and I couldn't even finish it, because the flavor was so unappetizing! The french fires I ordered on the side were cold and had way too much seasoning. My boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich. It was better then mine, but that ain't saying much. I think my real annoyance comes from the fact that the bartender offered us things like onion rings and additional cheese with out mentioning that they were an extra charge. I knew they were extra, but I don't like it when my \"server\" tries to jack-up my tab. 

They have live music... which I don't think I would have enjoyed... From the posters, the musicians all looked kind of aggressive and loud... Not typical dining music. They also have \"Carver Jones\" playing there... He plays everywhere in Chandler. He's also kind of douchey. 

All-in-all, I really cant see my self returning... Their are several other places with more menu options.

PASS...."}
{"text":"Went to Harvey's when it first opened, and you could tell they had some work to do to iron out the kinks of a new restaurant.  Wasn't initially impressed, except that the team was friendly and open to feedback.  

Just left there tonight, and man is that the place to be in the San Tan area.  The open air bar area was packed with people and the drinks were flowing.  The team was on their A game with refills of drinks before you could ask.  I think they added a few TVs as you could watch the Cardinals game all over the place.

Wife and I ordered the Strawberry Salad, and it's often hard to find a place that uses dark greens as generous as Harvey's does.  No wilted greens here, it was if they had picked it fresh out of the garden out back. Fresh bleu cheese and candied walnuts with other dried fruits all added to the richness of the salad.  

I gotta say tonight's experience has me looking at the calendar slotting the next visit.  Bravo team Harvey, bravo."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great from the outside and has a good ambiance and this is all a cover up for bad food and bad service.
We sat at the bar and waited for a drink. The bartenders looked us straight in the eye and never acknowledged we were there. We had to ask for a drink.  That was a long agonizing process.
We told the hostess we would like a table. She said she would let us know when one came available. We waited and watched her seat others. She forgot.
Then when we finally got seated we waited again for almost 20 more minutes and once again we had to ask for a waitress to take out order.
Mind you..the waitresses walked past us at least a dozen times and didnt even acknowledge us. 
Then we ordered out food (two burgers)..that was another wait an we had to ask the waitress to check on our order. Food finally came and the burgers were similar to something I could have gotten at the Burger King drive thru! We asked for medium rare and we were presented with these well done hockey pucks! 
Really...nothing good to say about the experience."}
{"text":"Had the Cajun Burger with Garlic Fries. Just a note that the Burger was overcooked and dry as I ordered it Med/Well not well done but the small spread of Cajun dressing was flavorful and had a good kick to it. next time I will order a burger Medium. and the garlic fries just had some chopped garlic on them when I think they should have added some olive oil and parmesan-reggiano cheese on it.  Overall. I enjoyed the atmosphere and will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some live music on Saturday, great crowd until the band started and 75% of the people left with in the first 3 songs.....and it was a mellow band!!!  Ordered my IPA and Jameson shot, and I know my whiskey, they had it watered down. DAMN IT!!!!  Bar staff was good, didn't try any food. Harvey's did nothing to excite me, doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I always drive by but never go in. Well, we changed that... We walked in and it was easy to find a seat as it wasn't busy yet. We were created properly and promptly. We were given menus, our server answered questions, made suggestions... The fried pickles were good and made in house! My wife had the Fried Egg Burger, loved it! I had the Southwest Burger, loved it! The beers on tap were some of the best! I'm surprised they had many good ones for a \"Mom and Pop\" place. The one thing I didn't like was watching many of the staff members including a female cook, interact with an older gentleman by the name Paul. They gave him a plate with chicken and tomatoes. However, they replaced the tomatoes multiple time with their bare hands. At first they were full sized regular tomatoes. They laughed as he ordered a chicken breast with sliced tomatoes. He clearly was given whole ones as a joke. However, they took the tomatoes with their bare hands and replaced them with grape tomatoes. Again, laughing at the joke of giving him the wrong tomatoes. Finally, the tomatoes were once again removed with bare hands from an employee and replaced with sliced ones. As a chef, many sanitation issues come to mind! Not to mention, the cook had her dirty apron on outside of the kitchen. Which is against the health code. I like the food, unfortunately, after seeing how the cook and employees handle food... I'm not sure I'd trust this place again."}
{"text":"Sat down at a table and waited for 10 min. Not a single server or employee noticed us. Went to tell the hostess and no one was around. How are they still in business? We left and won't come back."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely fantastic.  We started with nachos which were some of the best I've ever had.  Make sure to get chicken and carne Asada. Burger was cooked to perfection and girlfriends enchiladas were great too.  Had a good experience with the service as well.  

The only complaint I had was the cleanliness of the tables.  We were going to sit outside but tables were dirty and sticky.  The table we chose inside wasn't the best but they took care of it upon request.  Definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. We shared a hot Italian sandwich and chop salad. The western chop salad with chicken on the lunch menu was huge. Kudos to the waitress who made us feel special. We had a bit of a wait as the patio was full, but she made us feel like honored guests. Next time we will try the beers, but on our motorcycle so no booze. 
Wish there was a Harvey's in Tucson. Made our Saturday Harley ride and late lunch great."}
{"text":"Could have some potential but needs to tweak a couple things...

The patio is terrific and so is the ambiance inside the restaurant.  Two good points.

The food was okay.  We ordered the pork sandwich.  Nothing to write home about, but it wasn't bad and wasn't overpriced.  The fries had potential as well, but the batch we had was a little on the luke warm side.

Now on to the beer.  I was a little put off that it was 6 dollars for a pint.  There are numerous places close by that one can go and get a cheaper beer with better selection.  I hope they fix this...

The band that plays at night...meh...

All in all, there are some growing pains, but it may get better.  I am hopeful"}
{"text":"Not much has changed at Harvey's APH over the past year ... but I'll kick it up one star for still being in business. 

The big plus, there's nothing else like it in the 'far' East Valley and they're open till 2am. (That's 5 stars in my book)

While I've yet to meet the same bartender or waitress twice, I really hope they figure it out as the Public House thing is a really cool concept."}
{"text":"Not good at all!   Food is horrible.  I've had in the past the burger which was ok.  but not impressed.  So I order out this time and they got it wrong.   I order the tuna sandwich that had one scoop of tuna on it and some chips, which I didn't order.  I order the salad.   I wouldn't recommend this place.  Blu 32 is way better next door!"}
{"text":"Glad web had a groupon... won't be back. Good location, cute place, bad food and service. I asked the server how the ahi salad was and she said \"I'm scared of it\". Awesome."}
{"text":"what a disappointment.  A beautiful patio full of cigarette smoke.  Even the menus smell bad.  According to our waitress she re sat us in the \"non smoking section of the patio\" on the fake green grass.  This area is right next to the smokers and the bar is directly adjacent where patrons were smoking there, as well.  We then moved to the inside where unfortunately the onion rings we ordered were way over cooked and too greasy.  We just went for appetizers and wine.  Service was good but nothing else was.  What a poor business decision considering the area it is located in has far more non smokers than smokers.  I didn't even think it was legal in gilbert to allow smoking where food was being served but I must be wrong.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few months ago and both the service and food was incredible. Going there again this week sometime. Can't wait."}
{"text":"The bad: Self seating left a small wait till we were noticed. Burgers were overdone.
The good: Interesting decor, casual fun atmosphere. Great iced tea. The house made potato chips and dip were fabulous. Lots of beer on tap.
Overall a good experience we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! My husband and I go all the time. Service is very good and the prices are great especially during happy hour. My favorites are the nachos and the strawberry salad. My husband has tried all the sandwiches and his favorite is the turkey club but they are all fantastic. Be sure to ask about the rewards card, they don't seem to advertise it, but it is free and you earn money every time you go. They also have the best beer choices. Definitely a place you need to check out."}
{"text":"Started outside at first and had great service, but with people smoking on the patio, it ruins it for those who don't smoke and are forced inside, or leave all together.  We chose to go inside.

Our new server was just as accommodating and we had a great time.  Nice beer selection and food was just as good.  Very clean atmosphere and the young man singing and playing guitar was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has a few kinks to work out.  That being said, the food was good.  Staff could use more training.  The patio is fantastic and large.  The indoor seating is adequate and fairly uncomfortable.  I understand the old american theming but the seats could use a little more padding.  Lots of beers on tap and sometime there is live music which definitely adds to the draw.  Will try again."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times prior to tonight, and have really enjoyed the food, patio, and overall experience. Tonight was absolutely horrible!! 

It was not that crowded, and we had a party of 7 plus an 11 month old, so getting to choose where to sit was great and we thought service would be good. Our server, James, seemed very low key, but with it at first. After ordering a round of drinks and an appetizer, we placed food orders at a reasonable time frame. The food was brought out about 30 minutes after ordering,  but only two plates were delivered by another server. She then brought three more, then asked what else we needed - well duh, the other two. 10 minutes goes by - no other plates delivered and no one has stopped by so we could ask. Another 5-7 minutes tick by, and we see the lady who delivered the food. We tell her we are still missing 2 dinner plates, and she says,\"No one brought them yet?\"  

Mind you our server, James, has not been seen in 20 minutes. All water glasses are empty, some wanted another round of drinks, and three people finished their meals before two people have even been served!! A woman, maybe an assistant manager, asked how things were when finally the other plates were brought. She half assed apologized- said they were backed up. (There were maybe 5 other parties in there!) A bit later, James comes and says they are short staffed- I'd hate to see them on a busy night!!! 

We never assume or would ask for a meal taken off our bill, but at least an offer to remove the appetizer (chips and salsa) would have been nice. No one there seemed to care that the service was abysmal. 

Plus, it took our server about 15 minutes to split the check- then had to come re-ask what everyone had! 

All in all, the food was good- minus the moderately warm late 2 plates. That is the only reason a star was even given. Sad, because we really used to like this place. 

Side note- it says kid friendly, but there is no changing station in the restroom."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and good service! The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed...definitely locked down the nostalgia vibe they were going for. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered and I'm excited to try more on a future visit!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Fsh and chips over here and it was pretty good but I was really here for the few places that have some music after dinner and really enjoy the music"}
{"text":"I have not tried the food, but the bartenders are great and the service on the patio is good. They have great beer selection for a restaurant.

They also had a chalk board displaying what beers would be on tap next, which was a great way to lure me back!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice atmosphere but I was really disappointed when evening. There's about 8 o'clock at night and the weather was beautiful. The back patio an open bar area is a really great place. Unfortunately the food was not. The food was very plain and you could definitely tell that the homemade chips had way too much salt on them to cover up that they had been sitting out for too long or the oil had not been changed. The same for the fish and chips. You can definitely tell that the oil had not been changed sitting out for too long or the oil had not been changed. The same for the fish and chips. You can definitely tell that the oil had not been changed. The drinks were OK, the martinis well flavored. I was just really looking forward to the homemade chips and dip. You could tell that the dip was really good probably at the beginning of the day and that the chips when they are fresh, are probably amazing. But this was a Friday night at 8 o'clock and everything tasted like it had been fried in the same oil and oversalted. We gone there for drinks in the atmosphere but not the food lately."}
{"text":"First impression today. Ice tea not fresh, but from the fountain. Yuk..  Chicken on a salad with strawberries $12.95! Too much money. Burgers start at $9.99!  I don't think this place will survive. Blue 32 has the sports, and the better menu. For me, I'm not returning.  For many, I think that they will go if Blue 32 is too busy.  The food turned out to be just OK.  The presentation average.  I would say it is worth a try if you like basic bar food, but overall, there are too many better places to go to continue to frequent here.  Time will tell."}
{"text":"Well, even though I said I would not be back, I do believe in second chances and decided to give Harvey's another try.  Completely different experience as we received great service from Kelli, dressed as a giraffe for halloween.  The food was awesome, both of us had burgers that are more than worthy of a return visit.  

We we're also checked on twice by a manager and the owner Frank who we shared our first experience with.  He made no excuses, just extremely grateful that we gave him another chance to prove they have come a long way.  They have a great patio area with a fire pit which we are now excited to frequent this winter."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had such a great lunch there we went back the very next day. Our server on the first trip, Andrea was incredible. Super attentive, made great recommendations  and our drinks were always full. They have an expansive craft beer list that they rotate. The burgers are huge 1/2 pounders with excellent fries or kettle chips. The chips come with a creamy onion sauce. The second trip the food was just as good but the service was a bit slower. We tried the turkey club and the roast beef sandwich.We will add this to our list of favorites."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and I was very impressed! Had one of their burgers and it really hit the spot... my waitress was very attentive to our every need and the manager, I believe she said her name was Dawn, came by to make sure everything was perfect and even refilled our drinks for us! I have never had that before. Definitely worth the price and drive! This is definitely my new favorite place :)"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant because they have a great patio and we have never had a bad meal. We have had burgers, chicken tenders, stroganoff, chicken caesar salad among other things. I am looking forward to trying this huge pot pie that I saw someone order the last time I was there.  I will say that we tried sitting at the bar one time and the service was horribly slow as 3 bartenders/waiters continually walked by with us without refilling drinks, bringing the check or picking up the payment. Service at the normal tables is exceptional and we were told that everything from the salad dressing to the noodles are made in house."}
{"text":"Food way to salty my cevechi was :( I mentioned it and expected it to be taken off the bill but  wasn't! Pretzel roll doughy on the ruben as well:("}
{"text":"Beer list has massively improved over the years.  Food has too.  Nice misted patio and live music in the evenings makes this a fun place to relax and enjoy time with friends."}
{"text":"Never understand the poor reviews here.  The French Dip is seriously the best I've ever had - don't pass up on the french fries either (go on your cheat day if you must).  

Great draft beer selection, great food ... what more are you looking for in a local eatery.  Yes - it can be slow at times but that's what the great beer selection is for. 

Quit reading and go eat already!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Gilbert.  I came in on a Wednesday night and there was live music, the patio was packed - large crowd for a Wednesday night.  I can tell this place is going to be a hit.  As soon as I walked in, I could smell freshly stained wood, it gave me the feeling that someone put a lot of hard work into building this place - unique and not prefabricated like most restaurants in Gilbert.

Good selection of beers on Tap, I had a Stella.  For apps, we split some ricotta balls.  They were delicious - breaded and fried to perfection and topped with a little marinara.  For dinner, I ordered the chicken caprese with fresh veggies and mashed potatoes.  I was a little disappointed.  I love caprese and make it at home often -  slices of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella - it's a great combo.  I expected the dish to have more caprese but it was basically chicken topped with a slice of mozzarella, two slices of tomato and a little basil.  Both the chicken and veggies were lacking in flavor.  The mashed potatoes however, were the best I've ever had in my life.  I want more!  I can't wait to go back and try some more items on the menu.... or maybe just get a big bowl of mashed potatoes.  

The service was good.  Ambiance was very nice.  Restrooms were clean.  Although, they had a sign that said \"Let us know if the restrooms need attention\"  and I didn't like it, I'm not an employee, if you want me to keep you posted on stuff going on in your restaurant, give me a free beer or something.  Otherwise, make sure the staff knows to scan the restroom once an hour.

Also, this is a great place for a large party of people.  There was a separate room off to the back that would make for a great rehearsal dinner or retirement party."}
{"text":"I have nothing special to report about my visit to this place.  The sandwich was ok, the appetizers were ok, the service was ok - but nothing impressed me other than the pretty bartender who looked a lot like Olivia Wilde.  I guess if you live near this place, and want to try it out, there's really no reason not to - but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Use their party room! They just did a wedding reception for close friends and it was outstanding! They had a dedicated server for the room- which is not always the case at other places but makes a huge difference! Brittany was attentive, friendly, and fast. The party size  was about 35 and the guests all have glowing reviews of the food and service. Since I helped with setting up the room (to decorate) I can attest to knowledgable staff, even the cooks could answer questions about party details! And they were extremely flexible with music, offered a screen and projector, and had a dedicated bathroom. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"No stars because I did not get to try anything. Quick run down

11 am-we sit down
11:17 - someone finally came over to serve us
11:30 - drinks finally come to our table
11:35 - table next to us walks out because they waited 20 minutes for drinks
11:48- server realized the food had not come to the table yet
11:55 - food comes out
11:56 - send food back
11:59 - walking over to Burger King 

My burger was burnt and my wife received the wrong food. Will Never Try This Place Again!!!!"}
{"text":"So much I was not happy with this place. Came here for lunch with my wife for the first time.  She had a ruben on a pretzel bun, big mistake! You mostly taste pretzel then you do the meat. I had the chicken salad and it was ok. Had a seasoning we both couldn't  pick out, a little odd tasting. The \"Iced tea\" sits in a pitcher out in the open, warm, so it melts any ice in your glass instantly leaving you a warm iced tea. Seats we had is a long wooden bench and was not very comfortable. We both had a side salad. She had a Cesear and I had a garden with Blue cheese. My Blue cheese was runny and not very favorable. The salad plates are to small and flat, very hard to mix your salad dressing in , without your salad falling onto the table. There was just too much wrong with this visit to give them a second chance.......DOH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go on Sunday afternoon. Carne Asada Nachos and very fresh and tasty. Fantastic bartenders and Happy Hour on Sunday is great!!! Fantastic beer selection from AZ Mudshark, Four Peaks, San Tan, Phoenix Ale, and many more!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewer's were complaining about. Great service at the bar. You must try really hard to pour a bad beer. Food was good but I could not eat enough of it. Everything is made from scratch! We totally enjoyed everything we ordered. And I love that there is a patio for day drinking on nice days."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars i would.  The service was horrendous and please beware of  the WAITRESS BRITTANY!  We were extremely rushed from the minute we sat down. Even though we were rushed they still took their time bringing out our drinks and food. While ordering we specifically asked for our appetizers to come out before our entrees but instead, everything came out at the same time. I ordered the Fried Egg burger and the plate was covered in ketchup (yes, you read that right).  The botom of the plate was dripping in kethcup and after I was handed the plate it splattered all over my clothes and legs. (We were sitting on the patio)  The server, BRITTANY, was extremenly unaplogetic and didnt seem to care for the inconveniences.  She was extremely rude, impolite, and should not be in the restaruant industry.  After the horrible service we still left her a more than generous tip that was not deserved.  We spoke to the manager, Frank, and he was very courteous and apologetic for what had happened. As far as recommending this place to anyone? The food is great and definetely above average but the service is horrendous. It's worth a try but beware of Brittany."}
{"text":"Even with special diet requests they hit the mark.  The service and food was average at the beginning when they opened, but they are getting better at each visit."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio and a good selection of beers on tap. Its a great casual place to come out get some food and a couple of cold ones. The live music on Friday and Saturday nights is also very cool. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because they also have a rewards club card which you earn points on every visit, but out of the 12+ times that I've been here, they are always out of the cards. By this point I would have already had a hefty amount of points on the card. Also, the bathroom doesn't have a mirror which is a bit strange.

Food recommended: Reuben, Chicken tenders, Onion Rings"}
{"text":"We eat at Harvey's a lot. They have great homemade food and fresh cut frys and chips with great seasoning. Great burgers and sandwiches. The prices are good and you get a lot of food. They also have a lot of different things going on that will keep you entertained.   It's more of a bar type atmosphere but its a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a usual spot for my friends and I for the past few years. Service is known to be pretty slow, but we are patient people and still continue to return. Our server last night was great though, probably one of the best ones we have had there. Now I am not easily bothered, but what I saw occur last night did not sit right with me, especially being in management of a restaurant chain myself. We wanted to order some food, but we were told the kitchen was closed...no big deal. A group sat next to us about 20-30 mins after we noticed them ordering food(with a different server). We brushed it off thinking maybe they were going to be told the same thing. Then all of a sudden food is being delivered to them after we had been told otherwise. It was just incredibly rude and a huge slap in the face. I had asked our server what was going on and she told me that they \"bribed\" the kitchen and paid them to cook their food. What?! That's just unheard of and so unprofessional."}
{"text":"Back again. We've been seeing good adjustments. The service and food quality are back to good levels. The nanager is walking the floor. Beer is in stock."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with a pretty big group. They were very nice to let us use their party room since our group grew beyond the number of our original reservation (26).  

Service was great. There was only one guy serving our whole crew. He did awesome at keeping drinks full and checking in on us for other needs. It felt like he had a whole staff helping him when it was just himself working our section. 

Food was pretty good too. The fish and chips looked great! I will try that next time. 
I got the fried egg burger. Cook was nice (mid rare) and fries were great. My only complaint is that the egg is cooked over medium and there was not much yoke.  In my opinion, it should have been over easy so that the yoke pours out when cut into. 

I also tried the chips and dip. Great home cooked chips with onion dip. Great flavors and textures. 

The carne asada nachos were very tasty. Not Mexican in any way, but very good. There was a sweetness to the nachos and they were also a little spicy. 

Just as we were getting leave, a band showed up. Turns out that they have live music on Friday nights. 

Parking is scarce, so get here early to get a spot."}
{"text":"The parking lot was full on an early Friday night. We were impressed on the volume of people to the area.  Asked the hostesses to be seated, she asked my preference inside or outside. She gave us our seating time for outside and were seated as promised. 
After being seated 2 waitresses asked if were ready to order.  Which is a good think they want to serve their customers.  After a bit Ellie came by to check on us. Ellie was very helpful pointing out some favorite beers. She was very patient and attentive taking our orders.  I tried the flight beer tasting which was a great recommendation from Ellie. Found some great beers thank to Ellie. Our food was a little slow in coming surprisingly we were served a side of chips while we waited. Which was greatly appreciated.  Our food was worth waiting for we had French dip and the Cuban sandwich.  The whole experience was great!   The beers we tried are Guinness Blonde, Vanilla Porter, Wasatch Apricot, Pumpkin Ale, Iron Fist Stout  I highly recommend this place if you want to have good beer great food and wonderful experience with friends!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had mixed impressions. A pleasant environment with a nice outdoors seating with a well crafted fireplace. They have mugs you can keep there and the staff are friendly enough. Not always there on the service but hey it's more of bar anyways. They have live music sometimes which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the beer selection is good too. I had the dry rubbed pork ribs. Stone IPA was really good too."}
{"text":"I just came back from opening night at Harvey American. It was their first night so I tried to give them some slack, but it was just too horrible and I quickly ran out of slack. Their \"garlic fries\" consisted of a plate full of greasy soggy fries with a clump of ground garlic thrown on top. Had to ask the waitress for napkins, utinsels, condiments, and remind her that I ordered a beer. The place is right next to Blue 32 which ALWAYS has excellent food and service. So I was a little surprised that they'd open with such a poorly trained wait staff and such sub-par food.  I may give it another shot in about 6 months to see if they got their act together...we'll see. 
For now though, they better go back to the drawing board."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, and I really like it. The beer selection is amazing, and their food is good. After their kitchen closes they have a solid cheese and meat board, just ask for more toasted bread!"}
{"text":"Egg burger is outstanding!!!! Came here with the family and couldn't be more impressed!!! Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great place. Took them a bit to get going, but they are serious about creating an awesome local friendly watering hole."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Fantastic atmosphere and great food.  I was very impressed with the service my husband and I received from our server, Tricia.  She was quick, courteous, knowledgable and just overall very pleasant.  I would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Average at best... Empty @ 12:30 on a weekday for lunch.... Fries may be cut fresh but limp & soggy"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT atmosphere, service, and food!

My boyfriend and I weren't sure about this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews, which turned out to be totally misleading. Do not judge this restaurant by the false and misleading reviews. Check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed!

Our first impression was the atmosphere, which was very inviting. Personally, I love all the natural wood. They could work on the decor though, as it seemed a little disjointed.

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly, attentive bartender. Not only did the bartender ask if we wanted something to drink - He asked what our preferences were, and suggested drinks based on that. He was spot-on with the suggestions, and even made a 'blend' of tap beers that suited my taste perfectly.

We then ordered food. I chose the Ruben Sandwich, which was made with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut, on a pretzel bun. I hesitated at first, never having a Ruben made with coleslaw, but was told that the Ruben was delicious, and the pretzel bun made it even better - so I decided to give it a try. 

I substituted fries for a side salad, but was hesitant on which dressing to choose. Not even knowing I preferred lighter dressings, the bartender suggested the vinaigrette. The salad came quickly and was fresh and delicious - with all veggies cut into small pieces, making it easy to eat and enjoy. Not only was the vinaigrette delicious, it was put in a separate small dish, giving me the option as to how much I wanted to add to my salad.  

The Ruben sandwich was delicious. The thinly cut corned beef was piled high, and the coleslaw and thousand island dressing complimented it perfectly. The pretzel bun was warm and soft, a perfect of 'bread' for the Ruben. My boyfriend ordered the American Cheddar Burger with fries, and he was not disappointed, saying it was one of the best burgers he's had, and he enjoyed the fries too - which were tasty and not greasy.

Our overall experience and first impression of Harvey American Public House: Inviting atmosphere; Friendly staff  - the bartender AND two friendly wait persons who just got off work and sat next to us; Quick service; Delicious food! I would only suggest they work on the decor to make it less barren and disjointed - something that will compliment their style.

We were very impressed and will definitely be going back, and may very well become regulars!"}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous service. Wonderful atmosphere. Servers and bartenders were off the hook with service. Tricia is the best! A must try!"}
{"text":"Neat setting, very rustic and original.  Lots of great beers on tap, their blood orange margarita seemed to be very popular as well.  They have a pretty decent menu too.  I usually have the French dip and have never been disappointed.  The only thing semi-negative is the attentiveness of their servers.  They all too often seem  to congregate and chat around the bar well."}
{"text":"After two trips to Harvey American Public House, I think three starts is a fair rating. The first time I went there was with a larger party. Our service was not terrible, but was still lacking some personable traits. Personally, when my server is nice and friendly and doesn't mind chatting about the small things, I think it makes the experience a little better. Now, this place is busy, I get it (I used to wait tables too). Server's don't have all of the time in the world to chit chat, but at least asking how I am doing or something small like that would have made a difference. The food during the first visit was good. I don't recall having any complaints. My boyfriend's mom, who was one of the guests there with me, really enjoys this place because of the rotating tap and seasonal beers that they have on draft. This visit, I would say was pretty successful. 

The second visit was just a few nights ago. Our server was not attentive and when I ordered a beer it took 10+ minutes for her to bring it out to me. There were two bartenders behind the bar. Now, again, they were busy, however I know that the beer had been poured much sooner than she had brought it to me, because by the time I received it, it had NO head and was starting to get warm. I don't know if any of you have had a vanilla caramel porter before (VERY DARK BEER) but when it starts to get warm, it starts to get nasty. I ended up not even drinking the whole thing because it was so gross and basically unbearable to drink. We ordered some of the nachos that they serve. I understand that this is not a Mexican restaurant, so I didn't expect them to be insanely delicious, however, I ended up thinking that they just plain bad. The chicken on the nachos was dry, the chips were stale, and they were so spicy I could barely choke them down. Luckily, one of my friends who was there with me really liked the spiciness of them and ate the nachos. I decided to get the risotto balls because I was still starving. These were delicious. If there is one thing that HAPH is doing PERFECTLY, it's those risotto balls. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is good. They constantly have live entertainment which is pretty cool, but a lot of country music. SO if you aren't a fan of country (just like I'm not) then you may want to steer clear of the times when live entertainment is there."}
{"text":"The food was simply amazing. I had the fried fish and the batter was light and crispy. My husband had the grilled wings and loved that they came with the sauce on the side.

The service was quite a bit different. We waited 10 minutes to get seated by the host, there was plenty of seating available, but maybe no one wanted to wait on us I'm not sure. It's like the host was trying to find a waiter that would take us. We considered leaving it took so long.

Our waitress was attentive at first, then not so much. The food came out hot and in a decent amount of time.  We were checked on maybe one other time by her. A manager or someone else stopped by and we ordered a beer, it finally came 10 minutes later. Then the manager stopped by again and cleaned our table, and then we sat there for another 15 before the waitress would bring us our bill.

Hopefully the service issues will be resolved soon... from the other reviews I can see it's been an issue for awhile."}
{"text":"We had to wait over 30 minutes to be served a couple of burgers. No wait at the door. Then when we received order things were not cooked as requested. 
Had to send back . So all told from time we sat down it rock about 50 minutes to get our order complete. Lots of choices in the area !! I think I'd look to one of them next time."}
{"text":"We visited this place when Blue 32 was too busy. The place was packed and hard to find a seat. We each got some burgers and absolutely loved them. The biggest disappointment was the service. The place seems to be understaffed. There was a point where it seemed like I waited close to 30 minutes to get another beer after I ordered it. Seems like the place could be managed much better. They are throwing away money by not providing more service and turning tables faster. We will be back, but if the poor service continues, there are just too many options in that area to go to."}
{"text":"We have now been to Harvey American Public House Twice. I only give it  2 stars for the beer selection, would have been a 1 without the selection. The food for the most part has been good. But only being here twice we have not been able to try a wide range of the food. The service has been subpar at best. Both times we have waited at least 15min to get  someone to take a drink order, then another 15min to place a meal order and then 20-30min for the food to come out. We had to find our waitress each time to get a water refill, only 1 refill each time we were there as the 1 refill was difficult enough. Both times we were there it was not crowded(at least 6-10 open tables), so no excuse for them there. In my opinion from what I observed, is that they are very focused on the regulars. We observed many times throughout both visits a group of waiters/waitresses at the bar talking for long periods to the bartender and folks setting at the bar. They were doing this in 10-15 min periods and people were waiting to be waited on. My last and finally breaking point was the smoking allowed on the patio and at the outside part of the bar. The first time we sat on the patio not realizing that smoking was allowed. So the next time we sat inside at the bar but it really did not matter as it was just as strong a smell and feel of smoke as the outside. The reason for this is the outside part of the bar is just a big window opening to the outside from the inside bar. I had thought that in Gilbert this type of smoking was not allowed, but guess I was wrong. Will not even try again due to the smoking situation."}
{"text":"Can only comment on the (non) attentive service.  Came in on a whim while holiday shopping in the area and were greeted and told to sit anywhere we liked.  That was the last we saw of any service person.  We waited about 20 minutes until a table of guys near us hailed a passing waitress and pretty much demanded their already ordered beers!  The place wasn't busy and there appeared to be 2 service personnel (hostess or waitress) chatting up the bartender.  Interesting concept with their yearly Mug Club but unfortunately for the owner, we won't be back to try it out."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome--I'd give five stars for that. I got the chopped southwest salad and it was great. The fries, burgers, and sandwiches that my family got were also good.

I had two issues here though. The first was the smoking. Seriously, at least the patio area is like sitting in a cigarette and it was disgusting. I'm not sure if it is non-smoking indoors.. at this point I thought non-smoking was a law so I didn't even think to be ask to be seated in a non-smoking section. They should probably mention that the seating area is smoking since that is not the norm anywhere else anymore.

Second issue was the service initially. We waited about five minutes to have our drink order taken and then waited for ten minutes, drink-less, until the manager arrived and apologized. After that the service was fine. Our new waiter seemed super rushed and brisk, but the place was crowded so I guess it was okay. It just was kind of stressful the way he was rushing around. The manager was super nice though and checked in a few times to make sure everything was okay. So I feel like they were aware of the service issue and did their best.

So yea overall, awesome food.. gross smoke.. maybe I'll see if they offer to-go? Otherwise I think I'd spare my lungs."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful for this place... and still am, but the have some work to do. This area is in need of more options like this, things to do later at night. Went with a group of friends a few weeks after their opening. (Maybe a month?) Maybe they need a little more time...

The Good: great atmosphere, lots of drink options, lots of beers on draft. Live music. Jalapeno burger got two thumbs up from our group.

The Bad: our server did okay, but wasn't very knowledgeable and was incredibly SLOW. The place wasn't even busy. Drinks are a little spendy.

The Ugly: All of the food, minus the jalapeno burger. The Italian Beef sandwich is tough, dry and almost inedible. Fries were very cold, but don't worry they are overly seasoned and you can get a thimble of cole slaw instead. Then there's the chef's favorite sandwich, which is described as ham and cheese with chopped apple compote and noted as being served on a pretzel bun, WRONG. It was basically ham and cheese with apple pie filling on a unidentified dry bun. It came out with a hole on top as if someone had taken a bite out of it. Our group was laughing about this when a manager, who must have been nearby and overheard, came out with a bun top and handed it to me. REALLY? What was that?

Again I have hopes for this place, they just need to work out the food situation and maybe get a few better servers. (Take a note from Oregano's, they do service right over there. ) Maybe would go back for drinks and music..."}
{"text":"No one acknowledged us.   It was dead. Red wine came in a freezing glass????   Could not find our waitress to pay the bill   When she did come, she seemed annoyed .   Ugh.   Would never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, I had the rueben on a pretzel bun. My date had fish tacos that she raved about. Lots of great beer and wine options with an awesome outdoor bar and patio seating. Happy hour 7 days a week till 7pm with specials daily, yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited on Sunday for the prime rib special,and we were seated right away.Was greeted by our server(Eddie)who took our drink order.Took a few minutes to get our beers as he was waiting tables on the patio as well.ordered the grilled wings for an app,and were great.We didn't see our server for a while after apps arrivedThe prime rib was good,but it seems that our server forgot to bring us our salads,and any bread during our meal.Food is good,but they need to straighten out the service,as once people start filling the dining room,it is to difficult to wait tables inside and out."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday evening, was seated promptly but then waited over 10 minutes to even get acknowledged by a server. Place was not to busy but the service was BAD. Food was OK but the prices steep even during happy hour.   Won't be back when there are so many options in the area."}
{"text":"After our first visit last night, I'm going to give Harvey's the benefit of the doubt and go four stars but that may change with future visits. 

We started splitting a wedge salad, then had the Club and the Cuban. All very good. Then the place got a little busier and the service went a little south. Only two desert choices this night, the pizza cookie or the bread pudding. Kind of in the mood for something, and seeing nothing special about the cookie, we went with the bread pudding. We waited at least 20 minutes for it and it was ok at best, to us. Bread pudding can be very different at different places. I appreciated that it was over the top sickly sweet or drenched in sauce but it was too far the other side, dry, chewy and bland. It's a tough niche, the upscale pub where some are just drinking but families are welcome. We had fun and will try again but go elsewhere for desert after."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to start with this place. Worst service EVER & the sad part is it was 1130pm on a Saturday night & there was no one actually sitting inside the restaurant  or bartop, only a few people outside. Sat at the bartop inside & there was three bartenders (two stocking the bar and one serving  peeps outside) 15 minutes go by & not one staff member says anything to even aknowledge us. So we start to get up & walk out then all of a sudden the bartender says, oh hey guys can i help you. REALLY? He was just shootin the shit with the other staff members goofing around & i literally couldn't  believe it. Crappy staff (esp bartenders) & food was crappy as well. Dont waste your  time!"}
{"text":"The service has declined significantly. Last night was awful.  We never saw our server, even when we asked for water he wouldn't bring it. I had to give them my license for a Moscow mule, the copper mugs keep walking away. He forgot to bring it back when I cashed out. We didn't get plates for the appetizers. The first Moscow mule didn't have ginger beer. Not as good as it used to be..."}
{"text":"went there with my son and my fiance for the first time.  I will say that it is a true Irish pub house and probably not the best place for a kid but since we went in the middle of the day my son enjoyed it.  My son did get entertained by looking at the pictures, posters and antique items they have in cases and books as well. The food was delicious and honestly great sizes as we all had leftovers.  I got the salad (delicious) my fiance got the pizza and my son got chicken tenders.  They make all of the sauces home made 

downfall - took a while to get fed in the middle of the day with only 6 people in the restaurant 

Will definitely return as they have Guiness on TAP!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the wait staff. The last few times we have gone in we are met with an attitude of indifference at the door that seems to permeate the wait staff. Waited a long time to for our first contact with the waitress, though she was pleasant. Seems she had customers on the patio as well as inside and was spread thin, so it was a long time between visits. First beer came timely,  but could not get the attention of anyone for a refill when our food came. A different waitress dropped off our food (and that was literally what she did) and quickly turned away and did not ask if we needed anything else. Furthermore, she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to get her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and, apparently, waitress #2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food, because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her attention, even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was \"Trivia night\" (for the life of me I don't understand what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks), the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third bad experience we have had with service. There have been others, interspersed with satisfactory experiences. 
We both have many years in the restaurant business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First, choose people that are committed to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to take your place if you stumble. Second, management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers, including the technique of scanning the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually additional sales involved in doing this competently. Third, management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent things are not going well, they can do what they are paid to do, i.e. make it right. You only get so many bites at this apple HAPH, so you better get it right or Gilbert ends up with yet another vacant building with a \"For Lease\" sign in the window."}
{"text":"I really do try to go into a new restaurant with an open mind but with the service and so-so burger we received on August 11th, I can't help but give a not-so-good review. I have had several friends try this place out and they had favorable experiences so I thought I would give this place a shot. I consider myself a \"localvore\" and I only dine at local businesses. When I saw that we were getting a new public house in Gilbert we were excited to try something new. The atmosphere of the restaurant seemed nice even though it was dead quiet when we went. Loved the wood furnishings and the open floor plan. I figured that since this was a public house, the draft beer selection was pitiful. They have the Left Hand Stout and the Alaskan Amber Ale on draft and thats about all thats worth talking about  i cannot believe that they are not featuring any of our local breweries. 

The hubby and I ordered the mozzarella risotto balls for an appetizer but never got to try them as the server never entered the order in. When we received our burger and sandwich we asked the server about the appetizer and she just said that she forgot to enter it in.  Not sure how that happened considering we ordered our daughter's grilled cheese at the very same time. I don't know if she just wasn't focused or what, it was disappointing because I really wanted to try them. We elected to just forgo the appetizer so we could enjoy or main dishes. I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger which very much lacked the blue cheese. It was essentially a dry bacon burger. The hubby ordered the Reuben sandwich which was amazing. If I ever HAVE to go back, I will order the Reuben. The server also neglected to bring us ketchup with our fries and at that point I was done. Just wanted to finish the sandwiches and get out of there. 

It makes me sad to write a 2-star review but after the experience we had this weekend, I felt I really had to. Management needs to address the customer service issues and more craft brews need to be featured, otherwise I think of this place as another Applebee's."}
{"text":"Wings are grilled!  Lots of beers to choose from!  Nachos and wedge salad were amazing. Great casual atmosphere. Came two nights in a row was so good."}
{"text":"Gosh this place has amazing potential! First of all, the restaurant itself has appeal. The patio is great and the interior is open and welcoming. Customer service was great. Our waiter was knowledgable and attentive and really seemed to care about our lunch (and beer), which may I add that their beer list was great. Now for the food. The fried pickles were the best we've had. Instead of the typical cornmeal breading, these were thick pickles with a crisp batter that was not too heavy. The chipotle sauce on the side was a perfect accompaniment too. 

For entrees,my husband ordered the fried egg burger which he enjoyed. The bun was nice and the bacon was thick and crisp. No complaints there. My ribeye sandwich, however left something to be desired. I guess I was picturing chopped steak, but the sandwich was a chewy slab of steak, which though perfectly cooked medium, was so difficult to eat because it was sandwiched between huge pieces of focaccia. I appreciate that they make their own focaccia but this sandwich just didnt make any sense and could've been better. We both had the fries for our side, and they were covered with a seasoning that we couldn't place (thyme? rosemary?). Just some salt would've been nice! 

Like I said, this place has great potential. Customer service was excellent, the restaurant itself is very nice, beers were cold and the food was decent. Just a few tweaks and it will be success. We will return :)"}
{"text":"I've gone once. Decor is strange with a lot of wood accents and walls everywhere. I get that public houses are making a surge now but the menu is pretty plain and service was sub par, even on a Saturday afternoon when there must have been less than 8 people in the entire establishment.

I ordered the classic cheddar burger. It was cooked right, but had minimal flavor. The cheese sauce was thick, tasteless and made the entire sandwich messy. The fries were okay. Diet coke was from a bar tap and was flat. 

My 18 month old daughter got the kids menu chicken fingers and they were super greasy. Almost too greasy to even eat. 

Overall I understand why the slow start. There are lots of opportunities two improve the diner's experience with this place. For what I paid I would expected a much better experience. There's a sandwich shop next door-- same ownership and masthead  it we have yet to try that. Maybe another time."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night it was not busy. Ordered a local beer and was told by the bartender with the accent that we need to get away with that trend. He served me another beer. Unfortunately I did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic. Bottom line service sucked! I mean big time! I will not go back to the bar! Positive note I ordered the fried pickles and they were so good! I would come back for them. But will not sit at the bar if the arrogant little man is there!"}
{"text":"Sometimes little long to wait but overall worth it! Large selection on tap and the food is amazing!! Great place! Would recommend to anyone to try out!! Also have  live music on some nights!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with some coworkers. It was a slow afternoon and we decided to sit outside (nobody out there). The patio is spacious and well maintained, with an bar open to the inside of the restaurant. Service was a bit slow, especially bringing the food out. Some of the dishes were clearly sitting out for a while (read cold food). I had an apple salad with goat cheese, figs, and a delicious dressing. It was really good, but too small even for a lunch portion. I might give it one more try, but my first go around was a fail."}
{"text":"Not the worse experience but right up there. Several empty tables but we were told it would be 25 min wait. Got some beers from the bar (that is why I gave them one star) and sat at a reserved table waiting to be called. Finally ask the hostess why we could not have one of the empty tables and she finally got is seated. Ordered an  appetizer and it was delivered by a kid who placed it on the table and split the sauce and then walked away. Had to ask for plates and napkins and to please clean up the mess he made. We got plates and he took the napkins to clean up the mess and never came back with napkins. Appetizers and dinner were flavorless (ordered the Cuban and fish and chips). I will say that the pumpkin bread pudding was awesome (that was the second star). We have not been to Harvey's in a while and now I know why. So unless you just want a cold beer and desert I would not suggest this place. Go to blue 32 next door."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Great setting and atmosphere, ok food, horrible service.  Its a shame sine this place has a lot of potential. Four of use came in at 10:30 on Saturday night. Place wasn't busy. We wanted to sit near the fireplace on the patio. Only table was one that hadn't been cleared though there was only about a dozen folks outside. We sat down and were there for almost 15 mins with servers walking around and no one stopped at the table. One of our party finally got up and grabbed a menu from inside the bar. Finally, we flagged down a server and he picked up half the bottles on the table and left the rest. Another long wait and a second server shows up for our drink order. That takes another 10 minutes before they come and the rest of the table is cleaned. A third server shows up and tells us we are his table and he'll be taking care of us. We get the obligatory \"I'm the only one working\" apology. He is the only reason this place gets a star. We order two plates of wings and fries. Again another 15 minute wait. Other servers were complaining about work conditions in earshot of our table. Bartender was another bright spot. Oh, and did I mention the water all over the floor in the men's room? Fall lawsuit waiting to happen. This place was a mess. It's too bad because they have a lot of potential. Owner needs to clean house and get a staff that actually has some experience, desire, and positive attitude."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with the latest reviews. Unless you enjoy being ignored, stay away from this place. We live right behind It and used to go often when they first opened. Now it is like being invisible when you walk in. I hear that the lunch service is ok,, but we were ignored for 20 minutes last week on a Tuesday night. The place was over 1/2 empty, and when the \"hostess\" finally acknowledged us, she said it would be 1/2 hour before she could seat is because they only had one server.  I guess that meant they were only allowing 4 tables to be open.  Sheez.  
Ok so they do have a very nice outdoor patio area, and if you don't mind getting your own drinks, it's a nice place for good conversations. The only problem there is getting the bartenders attention, which, unless your blonde, female, and nearly topless, is going to take some time.  

Sorry Harvey American, you've nose dived and I don't see y'all being able to pull out of it."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service makes me never want to go again. It was so slow first of all and our waitress was visibly not busy. We had a group of 8 and it took WAY too long to get our (cold) food, get our empty cups refilled and get out checks. The server looked kind of annoyed the whole time (we're not a loud or rude group), and she never once smiled. I understand people can have a bad day, but the icing on the cake is when we FINALLY got the checks they had 20% gratuity added on! I know with groups most places add gratuity and that's fine, but there is no way I would have voluntarily tipped more than 15% for that service. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Story time... 

I live right across the street from Harvey's and have always contemplated going inside. Finally one summer night after coming home from a D-backs game my gf, puppy and I decided to roll on over for a late night beer. Here is where the disappointment begins

At the front door there is a sign that says please seat yourself. No biggie, we sit down in a corner area so as not to disrupt other patrons considering we have our adorable english bulldog who loves public attention. We wait 5-10 minutes and no one comes to acknowledge we are even there. There goes a star. 

Still thirsty, I go to the bar and wait another 4-5 minutes until the bartender finally meanders over and does not even say hello, how are ya, what's going on. nothing.. She just LOOKS AT ME. Boom we're down to 3 stars. 

Next she get gets me the drinks and when I ask for a few waters on a 105 degree phoenix night I am given attitude. 2 stars it is. ....

Well, they tell us our puppy is not allowed and we are down to the final Star.

I will not be back. The service blows and so does the no puppy on the patio policy (alliteration intended)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting for this place to open.  The area is seriously lacking in decent late night entertainment choices we were happy to hear they were going to be open late and offer live entertainment.

It is still a relatively short time since they opened so we expected some service issues, especially with what I had read on here prior to dropping by.  That being said ,yes, there are areas for improvement, however we had a decent visit and I will definitely return again.

We arrived about 10:30 on a Thursday night so the \"late night\" menu was the only option for food.  We were disappointed to learn later that the kitchen stops serving at midnight.  I would have been nice for the kitchen to be open later. We sat at the outdoor portion of the bar.  The ambiance was great and with the misters it was very comfortable.  They had a two man guitar duo playing and it was a nice background on a chill Thursday night.  But, again, we were disappointed when the band packed up at 11.  Maybe it was because it was Thursday but the patio was packed and I guarantee if they kept the music going until at least midnight people would have stuck around longer.

Beer selection is good.  They offer some decent craft selections and had OK happy hour prices - not the best but we didn't break the bank either.  The bartender was friendly but a little slow.  The crowd wasn't super huge so maybe he's still adjusting to the next bar set up. He was attentive for the most part and service wasn't unbearable. He made it a point to ask our names so i would guess he quickly gets to know the regulars.

Slow is the norm though it seems as it took about 30 minutes to get our food we ordered.  BUT, the food we tried was excellent.  I was very surprised actually.  We opted for the appetizer sampler platter which had a couple risotto balls, chicken tenders, onion rings and grilled wings.  All the food was excellent.  The chicken tenders were obviously freshly battered and cooked perfectly.  I'm not usually a huge fan of these as they remind me of a cheap kids meal but it had us wanting to order more which is why we were disappointed the kitchen closed so early.  The onion rings - black and tan - were also very flavorful and done perfectly - not too crispy and not greasy.  The risotto ball were OK.  I liked them but didn't care for the marinara being already on them.  Would have liked having it on the side better.  The star in my mind however were the grilled wings.  The grilled flavor tasted just like they came off a backyard BBQ.  We ordered the jerk sauce however they came out plain by mistake (the bartender comped us for this error without us even having to mention it) but I think that was a good mistake because the flavor shined through so well without the sauce.  I'll try them with the sauce next time but given the grilled flavor I can see order them plain and then dipping in the sauce to my liking. 

We will definitely be back again and hopefully the next time will be even better.  I do urge them to think \"later\" though - keep the music going later and serve the food later - even on weeknights."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch.  He had the Pot Roast Sandwich that could have been ordered at any fast food sandwich shop.  The side of fries that were ordered were seasoned.  I had the Ham with the pretzel bun.  The sandwich was good, but again, any fast food place would've been just as good.  The side I chose was coleslaw.  Again, this was typical and nothing special.  Our total for lunch $35.00.  My suggestion, go to Blue 32 next door or in the same plaza, check out Gino's.  You'll get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great bar food and drinks. I love to go on Wednesdays to play trivia with friends where you can win prizes! Also tacos are half off that night which is what I would recommend. Also great dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  

I've been a few times and can't believe I've never written a review.  Harvey's is Gilbert's own Gastropub.  They have great food with great beer choices.  They usually rotate their taps so to always nice to try a different beer than you otherwise wouldn't get a chance to and a normal bar.  

They have live music on weekends which is usually a full band.  It can get a little loud in there but save the conversations for the park and just enjoy the atmosphere.  

I've had the joy of coming here during St Pattys day and usually the chandler/Gilbert Irish band will stop by and play their bag pipes for about 30+ min.  Trust me if you've never had this opportunity to hear them you MUST.  It's indescribably amazing.  

P.S.  The Fried Egg Burger will put you in a oh so worth it food coma."}
{"text":"10:30am - 2:30pm. The deli side is open!  They have the best sandwiches!  I recommend the ham and cheese on pretzel bread or the turkey and avocado.  As soon as you step in Eugene makes you feel welcome, is helpful and genuinely glad to serve you!"}
{"text":"Came with several friends to see Chuck E Baby and his band perform - Chuck is an amazing talent and always entertaining. Check him out if you have the opportunity.  Started off with drinks (my friend had a Bloody Mary that was off hook!).  Went on to appetizers of risotto balls and nacho's.  Both were excellent, but those risotto ball are outrageous! Entrees were, southwest chopped salad, strawberry salad, salmon salad and a turkey club sandwich.  Everyone was happy with their choices which came out quickly and well-prepared.  Only thing that stopped me from rating at 5 stars was that there seemed to be a lot of confusion on the part of the \"runners\" with what food went to which table.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hate writing this review since we've been coming here from the time they opened. We used to love Harvey's, but now the new management and staff have really turned this place into a dump. The happy hour isn't that great anymore, but the worst part is the staff. We came in last night for dinner and drinks. While we were finishing our last beer the waiter asked for us to pay, took our signed bills, and then 5 minutes later asked if we would either leave or go outside since they have a current wait for tables (while they had 4 opens tables!). Not to mention, the waiter never refilled out waters, never checked on us until the end, and he grabbed fruit for our drinks with bare hands. I spoke to the manager and he said he would follow up back up with me, which never happened. I wouldn't waste my time or money at this place. There's plenty of other good restaurants around that area."}
{"text":"This is definitely first on the list when we discuss where we would like to go for some food and a drink, plus is walking distance to Fox's Cigar bar.  We have always had great service and the food is always yummy."}
{"text":"My daughter comes here often for trivia so I wanted to give the fries she always brags about a try! Great pub atmosphere, great fish tacos with pineapple salsa, hit or miss service, hit or miss fries! The first visit the fries were 6 starts! Garlic, gooey goodness. The second time, the garlic was no where to be found and they were just eh. The prices for happy hour are great and ok for other times. Great selection of beers but for a pub they are frequently out of several selections and don't update the \"this is the beer list for today menu.\" My daughter went through three on the list before finding one they were not out of. The patio is a great spot with a fire pit etc and will be fantastic in the fall."}
{"text":"Been here for happy hour a few times, but haven't tried the food. Drink service is usually pretty quick and I've never run into the common annoyances like asking for water or the check multiple times waiting for it to show up.

Nice patio space, but it can get a little warm if you're not near a mister"}
{"text":"I stopped in Harvey's American House on Saturday while my wife was shopping across the street at Koles.  As soon as I sat down a very energetic young lady sticks out her hand and asked my name.  Her name is Fianna, enthusiasm and great outgoing personality is a great asset to the owner of this place a lot of beers on hand, no Guiness to my surprise had Murphy's Stout.  Food looked appetizing and can't wait to go back for a meal. I hope Fianna will be working, she lights the place up."}
{"text":"We love this place !  Service is always good, friendly and professional.  The food is amazing. It is very obvious that quality product is used as we have never had a bad meal here.  The live music is good, always a different group so you never know what to expect, but that's a plus if you ask me. 
Now here is the funny thing..... I drink Moscow Mules.... a month or so ago I was at the bar and ordered one, the bartender told me he would need to hold my ID as some of their copper mugs were getting stolen, and they are very expensive.  I gave it up thinking that it was odd, but  whatever.  Then as I was getting into my car I realized I forgot to ask for it back and had to go back in and ask for it.  The more I thought about it I started to feel insulted and offended.  The only message this act sends to your guests is that your mug is more important than your customer.  So, this past weekend when we went in.... I ordered.... and was asked to hold my ID, I just said put it in a normal glass.  Problem solved.  It's obvious that it is awkward for the server to have to ask to hold the ID. We love this place so I've decided not to let it bother me, but I can only imagine how many guests will be so offended they won't return."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight great time. Fun trivia night. Food was good as always. Wait staff very nice. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this new place, food was great, service was quick! They need a little time  to get settled in but this place is going to be special. We will be going back! They had this ham sandwich was pretty killer, the wife said the salad was good too."}
{"text":"The special -Cajon pasta great! Add chicken  
Chicken enchilada also really good. 
Fun time good service. Have not been here but a few times before - it will be a first choice next time we go out. Keep it up! Good food and beverage options."}
{"text":"I went here once and they had a deal for a burger and fries.  They burger was average to me but it is a good deal for the amount of food you get.  I really like the brews this place had on tap when I was there and look forward to trying other items here in the future."}
{"text":"I was there last night may 8th around 9pm to listen to a band I like to follow.  Short story I'll never go back. 

The place was no busy I was just the 4th person at the bar yet two bartenders on duty... Should have had excellent customer service right?   Nope. 

I had one beer and asked for a menu,  given one but was never asked if I wanted anything.   I was obviously an interpretation to this lady bartender social hour.   I had to ask her to take my order in passing but still had to wait.   I would have left sooner but was the to hear some accistic music.   I ordered a salad that was rushedly thrown on front of me.   

I finished my one beer and placed it out to signal I wanted another but instead she took my almost finished salad and my empty beer and went back to socializing with her friends. 

I couldn't handle such poor customer service,  and had the second guy get my tab.   I would never go there again. 

On top of that the $5 salad was about a half a Palm full of greens,  a rip off. 

That bartender though shouldn't be working,  she's doing harm to your business."}
{"text":"Absolutely gourmet delicious.  We both had the thick pork chop with a delicate honey/mustard sauce and tasty broccolini and au gratin potatoes.  Lots of changes have been made and the service was perfect.  The owner introduced himself and we enjoyed the conversation with him.  
We will definitely go back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"The only good part of this place was the live music. You don't get much of that in Gilbert and the patio is really nice. But other than that...not much of a food selection and it's very overpriced. As well as the drinks! The Risoto Balls were terrible. The chicken tacos were not bad, as well as the fried pickles. But very pricy drinks after happy hour ends and the wait staff is very young and very unfriendly. Nobody smiles and you feel really uncomfortable. The owner came to talk to us and he seems very nice and hopeful the place will do well. It's very crowded on weekend nights, but I don't really understand why, due to the prices. I hate to say it cause I really wanted this place to do well, but Blue 32 next door is MUCH better. Very large menu and great customer service."}
{"text":"The food was really yummy but the low rating is because of the service. They are lucky we are extremely patient while dining cause many other people would be extremely irritated. 

Our server was very friendly, along with all the staff, but he was very forgetful. I ordered a water, my boyfriend ordered a beer. He received a sample of his beer and then his beer before my water. Then we ordered our food, still no water. Wait another 2 mins and finally get my water. We ordered two burgers, the Egg Burger and Southwest Burger, and fried pickles. 30+ mins later we received our burgers, no pickles. The server who brought our food out asked if we needed anything else, I said we are still waiting on fried pickles and I asked for a ranch. 10 mins later, I am assuming a manager, walked by and asked how everything was, I told him we were waiting on fried pickles and a ranch. He apologized and ran off quick to get out food. Comes back to the table to let us know my ranch will be out in a min and the pickles will be out in 5 mins. Why couldn't he bring me my ranch? Anyways, our original server appears and apologizes and give us our pickles, he said he forgot to put them in. At this point we are basically finished with our meals."}
{"text":"Had a lovely evening sampling craft beers with friends. Harvey American has a laid back environment making it easy to relax and enjoy yourself. While the selection of beers is world class, the bar food is also worth trying. I recommend the tacos!
Swing by for trivia and you won't regret it. The bar makes a mean dirty martini if you're not feeling beer!"}
{"text":"The food is always great!  Love the beer selection. The menu was just refreshed with some awesome choices! Was able to sneak a peek at the kitchen, and it was cleaner than my kitchen and I spend time every day to make sure it is very clean. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. My favorite food item is the black & bleu burger. It is so delicious. The second time I ate here, I tried the Jinglehopper cocktail. It's bright green and a bit overwhelming when you see it, but it was so delicious. They have great happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers, and the servers are friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been there a handful of times. Service and food are less than average. Just sat at the bar for over 5 minutes and not only did we not receive service, but the bartender literally looked past/through us to the people sitting in either side of us. She didn't even say she'd be right with us or acknowledge us in any way. We walked out out and went straight to Blue 32, which, not surprisingly, is packed for happy hour... they clearly don't have any real competition. Harvey American needs to step up their service and menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and we were very happy!  The bartender Frank was very knowledgable about beers, offered menu ideas and very attentive!  Can't wait to visit again!  If we lived closer it would be our \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nice staff, ok food, but the service is always unbelievably slow! Especially if you're ordering drinks at a table. I'm assuming this is because the bar is slow getting the drinks out and not the fault of the staff? Idk. The servers never stop back even to apologize for the wait or check if you want a refill. Sure is frustrating, and unfortunate for the servers because we would most likely order many more drinks under other circumstances."}
{"text":"When I rate a restaurant, I consider the food, service and ambience.  

Those 3 things were great at Harvey's, however I am stingy with my 5 star reviews.

Some may find these critiques as minor, but the men's only bathroom-stall wouldn't close.  Also, the water they served tasted like unfiltered nasty tap water."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar unless you have a ton of time to kill...  mediocre food saved by good beer. This place is getting lazy."}
{"text":"OMG! Their food is so freaking good! The two I recommend is the flat bread or their burgers! Which they make the burger bun fresh each day! It is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Warning!!  Me and a friend of mine went here for lunch on a recommendation from a coworker.  We both ordered sandwiches in the bar area.  The sandwiches were large but bland and after taking my second bite of the sandwiches realized there were small bugs crawling around in my sandwich!  I called the waiter over and he immediately took it away and offered me something else.  NO THANK YOU!  We were not charged for the meal but I will not EVER go there again.  Check your food people!"}
{"text":"This pub had a really cool look and feel right when you walked in. They had a band that was very good and at a reasonable volume. The beer selection was great! The server was very polite and was trying very hard, but seemed a little out of it. Most of the food was decent, but left something to be desired, particularly the chicken in my salad. I couldn't eat it. The French fries and skillet cookie were delicious, though. It is conveniently located so I will probably be back, but probably only for drinks, apps, or dessert. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Nice patio, great tasting drink (Orange Bliss), quickly seated

Cons:
Slow service, glass full of ice with very little liquid, long wait for food, rude bartender/bad waitstaff

Stick to Blue 32 even if there's a wait. There are way too many options near this place to waste your time & money."}
{"text":"Def not as impressive as I thought it would be. Food was bland and our waiter was horrible."}
{"text":"K and I stopped by Blue 32 but since there was a huge line with a wait of 40 min+, we opted to walk down the way to Harvey's. We've been here before a couple of times and thought we would check it out again.

Unfortunately, my feelings about this place have not changed. The bottom line is it is a HUGE waste of what is a potentially amazing and awesome place. The first thing is, why does Blue 32 have such a long wait and yet Harvey's doesn't? The patio is nice and one side of the bar faces the patio. Inside or out there is just an uber cool feeling that this space exudes. But that's the building.

Our server this time was Alex. He could have cared less if we were there or not. He reminded me a lot of people I've trained in this business. You might recognize the type. They're the ones that are told they need to get a job and a friend is a server and tells them how much money they make and so off they go and apply at every restaurant in town and take the first job they get offered but hate every minute they're at work because they would rather be anywhere else because they hate the fact they have to work in the first place. Whew. That was Alex.

So the positive is that the happy hour goes until 7pm and it's 7 days a week. Awesome. Now if they would just have a happy hour worthy of having 7 days a week until 7pm. 
We each had a Summer Shandy ($4.99hh). Seriously, 5 bones for that and at happy hour to boot. 

Then we ordered the Nachos ($6.99) with Beef ($3.99). $11 bucks for crappy nachos. Here's what I said about them last time. Nothing has changed, they're still not very good. \"I liked the chips as they appeared to be made on site but the Nachos as a whole, kinda sucked. There wasn't much cheese melted on the chips and they squirted some sort of spicy aioli all over the chips. There were sliced cherry tomatoes and green onions sprinkled on top. The chips themselves were burned in a few spots. All in all, poor attempt.\" Yep. Nothing has changed. 

Great Happy Hour days and hours. Crappy Happy Hour Prices and Offering. Crappy Service. Crappy Nachos. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"WE have been to Harvey three times now and would categorize it as OK.

The beer selection is great with over 20 beers on tap. mostly microbrews.  The food is ok, nothing great.

The bartenders have been good."}
{"text":"Came here a few times already with my girlfriend. We like to sit on the patio and have a drink. It's a beautiful patio! Beautiful lights and I've always received commendable service. The servers are well acquainted with their beer menu, which is a plus. After certain hours, they don't serve food anymore FYI. Great ambiance to have a drink with friends! I'll try their food next time I'm visiting."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Place was packed for dinner and our meals came out timely and delicious! Can't wait to try again."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Food/ bar was the only good thing about this place. Bar service was prompt and appetizers were tasty. As for my salad.. Not so much. It tasted too sweet. I believe it was the strawberry salad. The waitress also liked to disappear for 30 minutes to an hour, even though it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Save your time and money! We waited to be sat even though there were many open tables. The service was awful! We were there an hour before we got our food. And the food is mediocre. If I could give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"The food is great and the drinks are usually good( but inconsistently made). The the that bothers me is the service: it is SO slow. The severs rarely check in, the bar takes forever to make drinks. If you want the check, you better ask when your order. The first time we were here, I swear our server was high or drunk because she asked us the same question over and over again. They are nice, but it really isn't impressive and they are honestly screwing themselves over. I would have ordered so much more if she had actually returned to the table! The servers eating in the party room really turns me off too, considering they should be working or out of sight... I think they may have sections that are just too large. Either way something should change because it's so frustrating I don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite place to go out to. We go here probably once a week. Everyone is always extremely nice, great service, and the food tops it all off. We have tried multiple things on the menu and have never been dissipointed. Right now we love the fish and chips, fresh and crispy, we also enjoy their carnitas tacos, and any of their sandwiches. The bartender is always really great and is bringing my husband beer tasters through out our meal. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not Very Good and overpriced for what you get . We got the nachos and fried pickles . Pickles were good but the carne asada  nachos were made with  bland nacho cheese, cherry tomatoes,
with some kind of spicy sauce sprinkled over the top. I got the chicken pot pie, very bland and runny. Kids got burgers and fries. Fries were overcooked, and over seasoned...  Burgers were just OK. The service was fine, if only he had better food to serve!"}
{"text":"Visited this local pub last night for the first time and had a wonderful experience.  My raspberry lemonade was delicious and potent.  My wings were big, juicy and flavorful.  Our waiter (I came with a large group), gave us pleasant and quick service.  I also had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Jim.

The outdoor patio with the fire and water display was comfortable.

All in all, a great time was had by everyone in my group.  We are returning next month and I plan on bringing more friends back to this locally-owned, non-chain restaurant in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Risotto balls? Yeah. That's what we thought but we ordered them anyway.  Don't know if I would order them again. 

We wanted to go to Blue 32 but they were too crowded and we were on our way to the airport.  Sigh.

The place is always empty and for good reason - the food really does suck."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into Harvey American a few weeks ago before going to a movie. We tried to go to a place around San Tan village but found it to be too busy. We walked into the bar and were greeted by the bartenders. We sat down and a bartender explained to us the mug club and let us know what was on tap. They did well in checking in with us frequently enough but not too often. We came back last weekend and sat out on the patio. The decor was nice; I liked the fire pit and the seating arrangement. It really had a great ambiance. Again our Service was great. Both times we had drinks only, but I would love to try out the food. There is a good selection of beers on tap, which was nice! 

Overall- great beer choices, good location, nice patio and friendly bartenders!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I ate here for the third time this week. The first time we left because of the mundane boring monotonous voice of the game DJ. But the food was good so we came back. So last night we enjoyed some fresh vegetables and some iced tea service was lacking but the tea and vegetables were good so we came back tonight to try some martinis. Our bartender was Joshua. I ordered a strong not too sweet lemon drop which came back tasting like lemon sugar water. After Joshua ignored us for approximately 14 minutes I finally had to get another server to remake the drink which was acceptable. After eating carrots and celery at 1 vodka and soda water and an order of wings they charged us $36. When discussing the bill they told us they charged us for the extra sauce, even though we had to send back three rancid blue cheese sauces which they replaced with 2 small Ranches charging us a total of $6 for ranch and $7.50 for a side of carrots and celery. They ended up taking off the first martini which we only took a sip out of. Joshua's response in a very snide and rude way was that the American Harvey doesn't give food away for free and what did we expect. So I will never go back to this place again and I am NOT shocked that their clientele is declining as per the word on the street in Gilbert. What a disappointment there are so many places to go in Gilbert why would anybody choose to return to a place where you are greeted by the snide rude dismissive behavior of bartender Joshua."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was terrible. I had a party of three and we went on a Thursday evening. Walked in, not busy at all. It took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come up to us and ask us what we wanted to drink. By this time we were ready to order as well. We just ordered water, a soda, and a Bloody Mary. Maybe another 10 minutes later she finally brought the water and soda but we were still waiting on the Bloody Mary. We could see it sitting at the bar so almost another 10 min later my sister walks up to the waitress/bartender and asks if she can just grab it herself. The bartender says, \"oh, I'm sorry! I made it but forgot to bring it to you!\"
Finally the food comes out. We weren't given any silverware so we had to get up and grab it ourselves. I heard they have the best chicken tenders and had high hopes for them. These had to have been the most dull chicken tenders I've ever had. They lacked flavor and were very plain. 
We had to waive down any waitress that walked past us because ours was so inattentive! Terrible service and boring food. Will not go back."}
{"text":"If next door wasnt so busy we would have never given this resturant a try. The food is acceptable, the service is par for the course. I know it recently opened which allows for a little forgivness. I feel like this place is trying to rob for the Irish and give to America, the decor is confusing and the menu left me hungry for more, this place is confused at best. . Seems like a BAR that i would have a great time enjoying, however i will make sure to only drink there or get good and drunk and get McDonalds on the way home. ."}
{"text":"Ok so I too went on opening night and one has to expect some bumps in the road.  I call my experience tonight, the good, the bad and the UGLY.

First the good.  The place is really nice, cool looking great bar, and an excellent outside seating area.  Our server (Audra) I believe her name was we spot on.  Ran around tending to our needs and felt bad about what is about to come (the bad and ugly).  Also great beer selection, and a very good menu which will get me back there to give them one more try in a month or so.  We also had the app sampler which came with Onion Rings (Black and Tan), Grilled Wings, Risotto Balls and Chicken Tenders.  All the items were very tasty but not hot, I am sure due to the pressures in the kitchen.

The Bad:  OK, again opening night, but it took the kitchen 1 hour and 45 minutes to get my wife, my daughter and myself out three salads for dinner. Once our salads came,  my wife ordered a Cobb Salad and what came out was a Wedge.  I got my steak salad and my 9 year old daughter sat there with nothing.  Not good!  After sending back my wives salad it took another 20 minutes to come out and hers came with my daughters.  I also saw other patrons waiting a long time for food, food was slow slow slow coming out of the kitchen, but again it had to be due to opening night (I HOPE).

Now the UGLY.  Look Owner (or possibly Owners who I saw there that night), its OPENING NIGHT.  Your joint is packed and you made NO and I mean NO attempt to walk around the place greeting guests (except for the tables of your pals).  I saw one owner sitting in a chair near the patio, and seemed focused on walking tables inside and out.  The other thing they seemed mesmerized in was this fire pit by the patio.  Its nice but if you have 100 people in your place on opening night all looking for food, shouldn't you stop looking at that and showing it to your friends and HELP?  Or better yet why not walk around the place  WELCOMING your new and potential future customers saying  thank you and at least showing some concern for the issues of the night.

Not to mention Hey Mr. or Ms. Manager, people WE SENT food back, why are you not out apologizing for the error in the kitchen?  Customer service is the #2 reason why I go to a place or not.  I would always prefer to go to a 4 star place with great service than a 5 star with no service.  

I have to assume that kitchen issues will be resolved and I will give the place a second try based on the menu and selection of beer.  But if this place DOES NOT get better customer service orientated with its management especially with Blue 32 next door (a great food and service joint) it will just be another place on the restaurant trash heap."}
{"text":"Where to start...

New place, so I still expect they're working out kinks.  

First the decor.  Nice...I guess??  Not sure what look they were after or how it ties to any theme (like that's really necessary) but I'm still trying to figure out the plan.  What I can say is that the seating is wildly uncomfortable.  This is something they need to work on.  On the other hand, once your ass starts to hurt I'm guessing you'll turn the table a little quicker.

Service.  Good.  Went at lunch so there was no crowd so they didn't get a full test.

Food.  Good...more on that.  

We had the Ruben and Italian Sausage sandwich.  Ruben was pretty good.  Not a traditional Ruben by any since but still good.  Italian Sausage was merely ok...not bad...just ok.  It had marinara sauce on it that frankly could use some work.  Had fries and cole slaw as sides.  Cole slaw was serviceable.  Fries were good.  But here's the thing...they put some sort of house seasoning on them which is not bad.  But, and there is a but here...there's a fine line between the right amount of this stuff and way too much.  I'm afraid if you ever got too much it could be a horrible experience.  Having said that my fries were good. 

Now I rated the good, and it was.  But, our waitress said they had hired a new chef (already?  they just opened) and were in the process of redoing the menu.  So maybe they know their marinara is so-so and that the stuff they put on the fries strides a fine line between good and yuck.  Or maybe not.

Regardless of the  above, I try again and see what happens."}
{"text":"We use to really enjoy this place.  They use to have great food and good music but the last few times we experienced bad service, they changed the menu and their choice of music put me to sleep.   I'm not sure what happened but I won't be coming here again.  Service was especially terrible Friday night!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow--had to get up and look for our server three times. Fries were cold. They forgot to put all the ingredients into the salad! The bathroom stall was broken. The windows were filthy. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went there this Saturday for lunch with the family. We ordered the bloody Marys which took about 20 minutes for them to make and tasted like tomato juice.. we had to add our own salt, pepper and it still was bland. I ordered the Italian sandwich in ciabatta bread. The sandwich was so dry and the bread was old and crumbling to the point where I just took the meat out of the bread.. The burgers were just \"okay\" and the rueben was served on a rye bun which added too much bread to the sandwich to enjoy it. The service was very slow and we had to continue to ask our server where our food was and for the bill after our table was cleaned off and we were done we were left waiting. There was about 6 other people in the whole place.. so it wasnt busy. At one point we even asked the server for our appetizer and he said that theres a lot of plates in the window.. uhm okay thats when youre supposed to bring it out. Originally heard this place was great which is why we wanted to try it, but the 6 of us were all very disappointed."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place b/c of the Groupon they offered, and we live right across the street.

I had the Fried Egg Burger.  It was okay, but the flavors didn't go well together, so it tasted kinda weird.

The real problem with the food was the fries.  They put rosemary on the fries.  That rosemary aroma ruined my whole meal.  What a strange seasoning for fries.

The one really positive thing about the place is that they have O'Dell's IPA on tap.  Awesome.

The service was good.

Three of us dined, and none liked it.  We won't be going back.  The fact that the place was nearly empty didn't help, either."}
