{"text":"Been living in Whitby just around the corner from this place for years. Finally decided to pop in for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Not a lot of spots when it comes to German food in the area so I'm happy to know this is a solid option going forward. I was pleased with everything we ordered, from the beer to the mains. I'll be back to try the well reviewed breakfast."}
{"text":"Now only serving breakfast.  Went in on Saturday for lunch at 12:45 p.m. and sat ourselves.  Waitress dropped off menus and came back a few minutes later.  We tried to order lunch items but informed they were only serving breakfast.  Guess it is just a breakfast joint now."}
{"text":"Found this little gem last night while driving back from camping.  I had the Rind Goulash which was very flavourful and quite delicious.  My wife had the Jager Schnitzel which was excellent and our little one had Kase Spatzle.  The Spatzle was devoured and the Schnitzel didn't stand much of a chance either.  Extremely well done, excellent portions for the money and the proprietor was very personable.  Very authentic and easily rivals any german food i have had here or back  Europe.  This is likely to become one of our new favorites."}
{"text":"WOW!!! What a great dinner!!! We ate here for the first time tonight with a German Meet-up Group. Service was great. Food was FANTASTIC. Chef Wolfgang came and chatted with us after....very personable and a true German master in the kitchen!! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was recommended by a neibours work mate, which is a good sign as word of mouth is the best advertising.   We were not disappointed, three of us each had a different Schnitzel and my wife had the goulash. I have had Schnitzel in other restaurants but they were nothing compared to this, I can honestly say it's the best I've ever had. Mine was off the specials menu and was filled with cheese and ham with a very tasty gravy on top. My wife's goulash was to die for.  You know this food is made fresh when you can hear them  pounding the pork in the kitchen.  We all had dessert which also didn't disappoint as they were all home made.  The owner Wolfgang came over to the table to talk to us, such a pleasant man, the waitress Terri I think her name was, she was very efficient and polite and out of the corner of my eye I saw her inspecting the cutlery and glasses on the other laid out tables to make sure they were all perfectly clean.  Our reservation was for 6-30pm and by 7-30 we were the only people in the restaurant, can't understand why this place isn't packed unless it attracts an earlier crowd.  Will I be back, you bet I will, lots of choice on the menu means I can have something different everytime. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant today with family for dinner. The restaurant has a simple decor, but clean and welcoming.  The service was friendly.  The food was remarkably good. I had to say much better then expected. I ordered a schnitzel with mushrooms and spaetzl, highly recommended. My youngest daughter, a picky eater, had chicken fingers and fries, probably the best she had in a long time. Portions are very generous; my schnitzel was overflowing the large serving plate. In true honesty, as most of the Durham restaurants favors large portions to quality of food, this restaurant, due to its great serving quality, could very much spare in size (maybe selling for a little less), so the the guests could enjoy additional items or the dessert. Truly not a complaint. I would suggest to add more vegetarian items in the menu and some great German breads. I will definitely go back and try their breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my family but our experience was disappointing. There were 2 waitresses on site but we were not so fortunate. Service was strangely slower for us. From the moment we arrived, we didn't get a warm and welcoming feeling. Our first and last visit. Thanks anyway."}
{"text":"Whitby has so much to offer, was there something I've missed? Yes, I did! Wolfgang's on Brock serves up German fare and I was excited to go. It's located north of Rossland on Brock in a small plaza. It is a large, inviting space with lots of windows and natural light.    The menu is even more inviting. They offer many German dishes as well as Canadian eats. I was there twice; for breakfast and dinner. I really couldn't tell you much about German food before this!    At breakfast, I had to ignore my affinity for Eggs Benny and get something else. It wasn't easy, but I went with the Bauernomlett. It was hearty! It was 4 eggs, onions, potatoes, sausage, peppers and bacon served with rye toast. Woah! Talk about a food coma! My friend got the Breakfast Rosti.  It was a mound of shredded potatoes topped with bacon. Tasty!    If you're going for dinner, be prepared: it's big. There's 200% chance the schnitzel will be bigger than your face. The looks of shock and amusement will entertain you when you see other tables being served their giant schnitzels that sometimes hang over the side of the plate.  They offer many different toppings, but I went with the Jager Schnitzel, because I love me some creamy mushroom sauce. I don't mean the sauce was just creamy, I meant it's MADE with cream. Thick and rick, it's a nice compliment to the crispy, light batter of the meat. I wish they had put it all of the spatzle. Not sure what spatzle is? It's mini noodle dumplings, not a lot of taste, but they are carb-tastic. My stepdad got the Rouladen. It's thinly sliced beef, caramelized onions, diced pickles and bacon rolled and braised. He liked it, but not the pickles. It's an unexpected addition!    Service on both visits was good. The place is clean and decorated with local artists' paintings that you can buy. A great place for comfort food!"}
{"text":"A gem of a breakfast place in Whitby. German style food. I had the Breakfast Casserole with cheese, poached eggs and holandise sauce. When the eggs broke in to baked casserole.......omg. Heaven !!  All my friends that went there also really enjoyed the food. Every kept complementing how much flavour was in each plate."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service. Wolfgang's has some awesome and probably some of the only schnitzel and gulasch in durham. If you're tired of all the pub food and chain restaurants Whitby has to offer, this gem will not let you down! Traditional German comfort food that will always hit the spot. The spetzle is always tasty and the portions will fill you up. It's located just a little north of Rossland Road off of Brock Street. Despite being on a main street, you could easily overlook this restaurant, but I definitely recommend you to try it for yourself  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"From a friend: \"Went today for the first time and really enjoyed the authentic German food and good chat with Wolfgang and some other German guests. :-) Will definitely go again! Highly recommend the Schnitzel and hand made Apfelstrudel with vanilla ice cream.\""}
{"text":"After hanging out at a mall in Oshawa, we decided to come here for lunch. Hubs wanted to give this place a try after reading the reviews. Are we glad we did! We got seated immediately after arriving. The restaurant is medium in size, meaning it's not too small and not too large. Most of the walls are yellow, but one is made of bricks. One long booth seat lines up against the brick wall, so that seat is good for large groups. There are also three blackboard menus that decorate the brick wall, so you can see what the specials are. You can also see the kitchen as soon as you walk in.  We were seated as soon as we arrived. There was a big group seated already. Their kids were a bit annoying. They were interacting with the chef for candies and dropped some on the floor. One of them dropped some candy on the floor and was told by someone in that group to leave it on the floor because the waitress will clean it up. I felt bad for the waitress because she was the only one working. It's amazing to hear and witness how customers treat the waitresses working in restaurants! I wonder if they do that in their home. \"Don't pick it up, son. A fairy will fly by and pick it up!\"  I ordered the Eir Mit Speck, which is 3 fried sunny side up eggs on top of ham in a skillet on a mound of potatoes and it comes along with rye toast. Delicious! I love the sunny side up eggs because it was nicely fried as well and gooey. Daughter ordered the Lunch Schnitzel with Fries because they were out of spaetzle. Even though she was disappointed that she didn't get spaetzle, she enjoyed the schnitzel and the fries. The fries were nicely fried and crispy as well. Hubs had the Breakfast Rosti with 2 eggs. He loved it as well. Everything is great with eggs for him!   Service was a bit slow because there was only one waitress coddling them and picking up their garbage for them. But, other than that, we enjoyed our experience and will definitely return. Maybe we'll try dinner next time!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Food has a German flair to it with Bavarian inspired sausage dishes and shnitzel, and my personal fave - Rosti potatoes with sour cream!  Had eggs Benedict, pancakes, and English muffin sandwich.  Usually get take out and even when the place is packed they are so quick that I don't have time to finish my coffee and newspaper."}
{"text":"Been there once and pleasantly surprised. Reasonable prices for good food compared with other restaurants in the area.  Finally found some great hash browns, not the potato chucks served for breakfast at other places.  Actual shredded potatoes and they'll mix in diced onion and peppers if requested. Looking forward to check out their dinners as well."}
{"text":"It seems like no one has left a review on the pancakes, which leads me to believe they aren't popular. Let me tell you... You people are missing out. I've been here twice and the pancakes are simply on point, some of the best I've had. Soft, fluffy and delicious. Served with butter and maple syrup, and lightly dusted with icing sugar. They come 4 small pancakes to an order, but they're surprisingly filling. I seriously recommend them."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The chicken schnitzel was definitely the best I've had in a long time. My family have only recently found Wolfgang's and are glad that we have. The waitress remembers my son already, and has developed a good rapport with him. The one down side to the business is the unusual opening hours. They're not the \"traditional\" Canadian restaurant's hours, so you need to check if they're open before going."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday for brunch. I had the casserole; Rosti with sausage and bacon, and two eggs on top. Except for the car count its great. The Rosti is shaved potato,  soft and crunchy at the same time. It soaked up my sunny side up egg yolks.  M had an omelette with spinach and other stuff, and polished the whole thing off. She said it was too big all the while that she was eating. Watching her munch away I was almost expecting to hear a satisfied belch as she finished, instead I got a \"oh my god, I ate too much, I couldn't help it but it was SO good.    This is the third or fourth time I've been, it's good for lunch, brunch or dinner"}
