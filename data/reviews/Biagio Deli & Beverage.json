{"text":"Stopped in around 1:30 to grab late lunch takeout on a Friday.  Despite being a bit passed the normal lunch hour, there were still plenty of hot entrees to choose from including chicken Parmesan, eggplant Parmesan, lasagna, sausage, meatballs.  I went with a chicken parm sandwich and a chef salad with chicken.  The owner and the two women preparing the food were very nice as we made small talk while the food was being put together.

The chicken parm sandwich was good.  The bread was delicious (a little crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside) and the filling was a decent piece of chicken, cheese and sauce.  My wife also liked the salad.  There were tons of topping to choose from (both veggie and protein).  

Glad I found Biagio's in the wake of Alesci's (south Euclid) closing.  I will definitely be back for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"You can't sit and eat at Biagio's deli, but they have some of the best, friendly service I have ever experienced.  They're an Italian mom and pop deli and beverage place.  There is a nice but small selection of wines in the front, and their foods are superb. The Biagio's are some of the friendliest and warmest small business owners you'll ever find, and the prices are very reasonable. Definitely grab a sandwich there sometime."}
{"text":"Chicken Parmesan is often considered overrated due to it's deceptively simple construction, but it is precisely that simplicity that makes it my go to pasta when attempting to get the measure of a place I plan on going regularly. With such a simple idea - chicken and pasta - any flaws in the dish or cooking shine right through because there isn't a lot of flashy ingredients or fancy sides to distract from it. 

The Chicken Parmesan dish BIagio's served me was top notch! 

The chicken was thick and juicy, slathered in just the right amount of sauce and cheese to make it gooey without being overly stringy. The pasta was delicious, and the garlic bread provided on the side was perfectly crunchy on the outside while maintaining a soft bed in the middle. 

Aside from the great food, Biagio's also offers a cozy atmosphere that, while not great for dining in, definitely makes you feel at home. They have a pretty large wine selection, desserts (order ahead for a cannoli), and an extensive deli where they can make pretty much any sandwich. Getting the food is quick and easy, and employees will offer you samples if you are unsure (they gave me a sample of some wonderful macaroni made with prosciutto that I will definitely be ordering in the future). 

Above all, the service is excellent - everyone says hello as they encounter you, asks about your day (and they genuinely mean it - you can tell!), and converses with you like old friends. From the outside, Biagio's might not look like much, but don't let that fool you because this place is a true gem. This was my first time going there for lunch, and I will certainly be going back much more often now!"}
{"text":"I've written a lot below, but this deli is a great place to grab lunch in an atmosphere where you feel like you stepped back in time.  If you live in Cleveland or are visiting, stop in and grab a sub or a hot entree, you'll be glad you did.

I first experienced Biagio Deli back in 2003.  My office was down the road on Lander in Mayfield and there weren't many other good places to get lunch.  The place is named after the former owner, and yes his name is Biagio.  Great person who sold and retired to the South.  

The new owners are carrying on most of the traditions that made the place great.  However, there are two things they need to remember; first, offer a small sample of sausage or veal, or whatever hot dish is going on for the day on a toothpick to every customer that comes into the deli.  Biagio did this for everyone that came in, and it was a really great way to expose people to new things and or promote something that was profitable.  Next, bring back the Italian Beef.  He had one of the best outside of Chicago.

Not to take the spotlight off this business, but Ferrara's on Mayfield is a more full service deli.  I love them too.

Biagio for great prepared food.

Ferrara's for the same, and for spices, homemade bread, oil, wine, etc.  

Update:

Visited today and found that the sub just isn't what it used to be. The bread was nowhere near the quality of the past and the cuts of meat were different than when Biagio owned the place. Based on today's experience, Biagio's isn't even in my top ten sub places in the area. Too bad because they had a really wonderful product with that sanguich (yep, sanguich).

I'll try again in a couple of months just to confirm, but the sliced ham had no flavor and used to be cappacuolo. Seemed more like straight up ham to me. Sub bun was grainy, soft all the way through, and just not a good bread product."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian deli in all of the Cleveland area. The subs, antipasta,and sausage sandwiches are spot on. The bread is made fresh every day.The family that runs the place is super friendly. If you are in the area, this place has to be on your to-do list!"}
{"text":"It all started with a cookie.
A hidden gem! I was in Cleveland for three weeks for work and didn't know my way around well, so lunch time presented horror after horror. Finally a local co-worker recommended Biagio's for a great sandwich. How great was it? We went there every single day for lunch (well, they are closed Sunday, so we had to suffer)
Not only is the food great, the owners and staff are  some of the nicest, most genuine people I've met. Our first day here we mentioned how poor the service was everywhere else we had been. The owner said he was sorry we had that experience elsewhere then said \"here, take a cookie\" What a delicious  cookie it was!. This is just like the old school deli's of my youth. Sandwiches are out of this world and while we sat there every day they engaged us in conversation and often gave us samples of dishes they were making. Each one was wonderful. Usually, I would grab something for dinner as well, like the best antipasti I've had in decades. I love, love, LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood shop with good cookies and cured meats. I've visited this place pretty steady for the last year. The pizza is solid too. The Wine selection is not so hot . They could step that up alot"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim on my way home from work. A simple little italian deli where everything looked delicious. The service was super friendly. I ordered a veal parm sandwich...which was very good and a large portion and was only $5.99. A large veal parm for $5.99?!?! Youve gotta be kidding me, awesome deal! I'll definitely be back to try some more of their takeout."}
