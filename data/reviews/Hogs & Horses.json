{"text":"I took my 3 yo son there last night. First we order the hot dog n his water and my 1 beer tap. The waitress came back and told us that they were all out of hotdogs so we went with the fried chicken tenders. No less than two mins later our food comes. The portion of fries were very sad. I split the chicken open to make sure that it was cook all the way and it was NOT. I ask the waitress nicely if they can make me a another one cause it's pink. (Told her that it was for little guy hopefully she would understand). Btw there was no sorry!!! She came back 10 min later to tell me that she put them in for well done.  I got them 30 min later and thy were well done too well done to enjoy. He fries that came with it were not even cook all the way it needed about another min. For the beer I received it warm glass was not even cold. To too it all off the bull riding started 30 min late. I never got a sorry and the food was not taken off.  I just know for the next time that my son wants to watch bull riding I jut might take him next store. Where I know that I will get cooked food,and COLD BEER."}
{"text":"dont order food here, takes way to long to get food. drinks are over priced and it seems all they are trying to do is copy surrounding bars. they do have an awesome band that plays."}
{"text":"Ok the drunken Mussels were to die for .. for a country bar these were fabulous.. Bonless wings were pretty darn good also.. the bar itself was pretty cool lay out plenty room to roam..The bartender Jen spot on.. Thank you TC.."}
{"text":"I  decieded to visit the new place in Cave Creek.  I noticed the reviews were either good or bad.  I did not go on a weekend because I wanted to miss the crowds as they have some entertainment during the week.  The menu was limited but what they served was very good and plenty to eat. The Wednesday night entertaiment was great . Kept me there for a couple hours"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy this bar and go there quite often. I wish the rooftop bar was open more and food easier to order up there but the employees work hard to make it a good experience. I highly suggest this place. Food is good also."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time while visiting family in Carefree.  Wonderful staff including the General Manager, Mark.  Got to meet the owner, TC.  He is a famous buffalo trainer."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the critical reviews in the past.  With emphasis on past. They are improving staff with  an experienced bar manager.  So give it another try when you visit town  i never had a complaint really but it was not my first choice   Now it is because Dawn is an awesome bartender. If for some reason i am being a Pollyanna i will report back  oh the mens room is clean  they have an experienced award winning chef bbq expert"}
{"text":"This is what I sent to Hogs and Horses, but never got a response.  First off I would like to say I have never ever given a bad review on a restaurant before, which I was about to do on Yelp.  I decided to contact your restaurant first.   My Family went to Hogs and Horses on a Friday night for some food and entertainment...We liked the atmosphere and everything was great until we ordered dinner.  The food took over 45 minutes to start arriving.   I can understand that since we had seperate checks that everyone's food came out at different times, but my family's dinner got served to a whole other table.  It took them about 10 minutes to figure out and then they grabbed the food and brought to our table saying they can remake, but would take a while.  We were starving so ended up eating the cold burgers except for my wife, because her burger was already eaten by the other table.  Who knows what else they ate off our plates.  At this time a manager should have been by our table and addressed the issue.  No manager came by at this time and the server instead of rushing my wifes food they just rang in another one, which was pushed back behind all the other orders.  It wasn't until there was another problem at our table that my sister in law insisted the server get a manager.  The manger came out and about 30 minutes after we all ate my wife got her burger.  He offered to take 25% off our bill, which we were happy with.  We were very understanding and just let everything slide.  Now the next day when I looked over my bill I noticed I was charged for not only the food we ate, but the burger the next table over ate as well.   This place is very unorganized and unprofessional.  Don't know how a restaurant can drop off a families entire order to the wrong table and it go unnoticed for so long, especially when burgers are taking over 45 minutes to come out.  I still can't get over how they just went over to the table and took the food out of there hands and then gave to us.  We will NEVER go here again.  I attached a copy of our bill showing we were charged for 2 hamburgers with sweet potato fries.  I would at least like to be refunded for the burger we didn't even eat."}
{"text":"Took our 13 year old and 10 year old grandsons to this fun place to see the bull riders. Great atmosphere with food about what you would expect at a venue of this type. We had a ball. The crowd was enthusiastic and well behaved. It was a cold crisp evening outside but it only added to the ambiance. The bull riding was entertaining and exciting. My boys had a great time. Come to think of it, so did we!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely lit. The service was very quick and the waitress was very friendly. The bull riding was pretty mediocre and amateur and I was about to go out there and show them how it's done. The best part of the bull riding was the dog that chased the bull back into the hold that dog was a savage. The food is pretty good but my friend booted it there so I don't know about that. All in all it was a solid establishment."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited over an hour for a hamburger.  Not one employee wanted to help and they kept telling us it is not their fault."}
{"text":"Super nice indoor/outdoor venue. Very casual & is family friendly. Go watch the bull riding Friday nights. Probably better to eat before coming here. Food is middle of the road. Pretty sure the brisket was left over from the previous night or is flash frozen, as there was a pool of water from the brisket on my plate. Waitress's were friendly, but are entirely overworked due to crowds. There were only two outdoor waitress's for probably 100+ customers. Place is very patriotic & laid back. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came back again and this time had a lot better service. Maybe we caught them on an off nite?"}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends, especially if anyone is from out of town and you want to show them a great Cave Creek experience. All of the staff is very friendly and the band always plays great music. Food is what you would expect from a bar but still pretty decent."}
{"text":"It was a great place to go and have some fun. Watched some bull riding and barrel racing in the arena out back as well, that was nice. When you walk in there is a full bar with tables to eat as well and a stage for a live band. When you walk out back there's a decent patio with heaters at night and there's an upper deck with a bar where you can watch the bull riding and barrel racing. I recommend ordering your food from the top deck bar if you eat, it's much quicker.   The food was what you would expect at a bar, nothing special but it was good. I ordered a hamburger.   The band the played was good with a good house sound system, they typically play country. A lot of cowboys there!"}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor setting with mountain views and events to watch going on in the arena. Great people, and with the gorgeous weather and a cocktail make it one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is more of a place to go for cheap beer and a biker/cowboy vibe and assorted shenanigans. The food was typical greasy diner burger fare, not bad but not good. Our waitress was friendly and generally good and helpful.  Four-stars for people-watching, fo sho (just don't say \"fo sho\" while there)."}
{"text":"These people are complete jerks. The bartender actually threw an empty pitcher at my mother-in-law when she asked \"how do I get served around here\"?  There was only about 10 people in the bar, including the band.  I cannot believe the bartender actually threw an empty pitcher at her!  When we asked to see manager, he said he was the manager.  When we asked to see an owner, he said we would have to come back tomorrow.  Then a crusty old drunk at the bar said he was the owner and it \"was an accident\".  When we went to leave, he said \"take your Scottsdale asses out of here\" (though we are not from Scottsdale).  So, if you hate your mother- in - law, take her here!!!  Otherwise the buffalo chip and harolds are cool."}
{"text":"I am afraid waiting for an hour and a half just doesn't cut it.  Cancelled order and we were walking out when the waitress brought our order and offered us a discount! No thanks. So really have no idea what the food is like and am likely never to find out."}
{"text":"Went to Grand Opening, nice staff, good food. The outside patios take it up a notch from the other Cave Creek venues. Looks like they are trying hard with lots of entertainment scheduled. Best of luck to Hogs and Horses!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. 1.5 hour wait. Yes it was biker week. But really?  Chicken not thoroughly cooked. However the chili was fantastic. Atmosphere is the only why I gave three stars.  Tons of potential. Poorly managed."}
{"text":"I just wanted to let everyone know that yes, Hogs & Horses did close down. But the bar is now open under another name - Outlaws - and under new management."}
{"text":"Great place for food, drinks and FOOTBALL! Come here to watch Broncos play!!! Go Denver!"}
{"text":"I like this place!  I love the live bull riding.  The workers were friendly and willing to help.  The patio is awesome.  We enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon:  Burger fries and a captain and coke.   The burger was good, just over cooked for what I like. It still had flavor and juicy but more med well.   The fries, the toppings etc it was all good.  The drink was good not too much and not too little.   Prices were good and the picnic tables outside was a perfect place to eat."}
{"text":"it was just simple food with a bar tender that was as funny as they get, it was just a nice time - no pretentiions."}
{"text":"The bartender, ASHLEY, talked with us, made us feel welcome and she was so sweet! A bunch of Cowboys hang out there which was very entertaining and very fun haha. Pool table, people were dancing, full bar, good food and live bull ridin'! Thank you Ashley for making our experience a great one :) Totally coming back!"}
{"text":"Jon Taffer really needs to pay this place a visit. One of the worst meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Margarita and was disappointed. The bartender was busy so I guess he didn't have time to be friendly. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service. We waited over 10 minutes to different bars at the place to get service. They would look at us. Acknowledge  we were there. But never came to get our order. Went to the Buffalo Chip instead. So much happier."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We made a reservation for 12 of us at 7:00pm on a Friday night. The atmosphere and bull riding is the highlight of this place. Our waitress tried very hard, but after 2 hours we still did not have our food? We ordered chicken fingers and onion rings, really 2 hours. After the first hour they put the order back through and said it should come right out, after another hour we finally asked the manager what was going on and his response was \"sorry\" these things happen. No comp on anything. We then went over to Buffalo Chip and had our food in 15 minutes. Will not be back and will let all of our local friends know."}
{"text":"Nice Old patrons to chat with. Security is less than to be desired. New year's eve came in to check out the piece. ID at door. No problem. Drink week. Listening to decent live music. Grumpy security guard asked I I was 21. Haha quite flattering for a divorced 44 year old woman. Giggle joke but man was actually mean. Insistent to see id. Showed id. He didn't smile or laugh.  He was seemingly upset. Not sure why. Ironically he did not ask for my friends id who is younger than me. Band broke and very few people came to liven the party. Left with no goodbye or gratitude from staff. Won't be going back here any time soon. The other bars in Cave Creek are much more friendly. I suggest you skip Hogs and Horses all together and visit the Hideaway. Roadhouse. And Harolds!"}
{"text":"Was there last night for a political event for Bernie Sanders, had not been there before. There was a pretty good crowd. There were free appetizers so that may have accounted for the crowd size, no offense to the next POTUS. The appetizers were breaded so I refrained (being gluten free), but had a couple of drinks, which were good. The service was good. After the Bernie stream was over, much of the crowd dissipated. The manager (owner?) went around to everyone and said to please help ourselves to all the food they had leftover from the event. I sat outside in the back mostly and there is a bar area out there. Also there were two bull steers behind the bar, it was a kinda cool place, westerny. Might go back sometime and see what they have to eat and maybe more drinkies. Love Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Strolled in on a Friday afternoon because the animals out back caught my eye. Bartender acknowledged me immediately even though she was busy serving other customers for a short time. After getting a perfectly cold beer and checking out the beasts, the owner strolled through handing out free donuts to each and every guest.   Love the atmosphere, love the good customer service, love the cold beer n steers :)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time to support a neighbor's band. Sat there for 30 minutes and never got service or a drink. People were having to go order their food up at the bar. The owner was pointed out to us & was standing around with a drink oblivious to the lack of service!  Really???  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last weekend. Although drink service is fine, forget about the food. The menu has very limited choices, but it doesn't really matter because only a few actually get food served to them. We waited for appetizers for a couple of hours while watching the entertainment and NEVER got our order. No apologies, just attitude. On our way out we encountered more people that had the same experience. Too many other options to bother returning here."}
