{"text":"I could have reviewed this place 4 years ago, while I was  still \"playing the falafel field\", however... I wasn't sure if I was ready to commit.  It's complicated. But I know now, you and me go together... ....  ......   ...!  I really like this place.  The owner is really nice and a good guy. Also he reminds me of Larry David, which for me is a plus. :)  It was slow at times, with new people training.  But, one of the few places I routinely walk to and don't feel cheated.  It's far better than the vast majority of places I found for middle eastern take-out.   Great portion size. I always get the plate.  PS: Old place on King and Bathurst was very good too.  Changed mgmt and became worse and is now gone.   There can only be one true shwarmera champion!!!!!!  PPS: I like/dislike all the weirdos outside."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is always tasty. Fresh ingredients. Great service. Good prices. And they're always open super late which clearly makes them a killer late night spot! Only knock is the decor, but who the heck cares at 4am!"}
{"text":"BEST SHAWARMA IN THE CITY HANDS DOWN!  Quality is there 100%.  Friendly staff.  Amazing portions and fresh!"}
{"text":"Since I often work late and need to eat something with my nightly medicine, finding a place that's open late, not too crowded, and is yummy, and cheap was becoming a bit of a chore in this area. Pita Way has been been my little guardian-falafel-angel lately!  The employees here are all very good at what they do. There seems to be an older gentleman or a younger man working whenever I come. The younger man is a little intimidating but he works extremely quick and is pleasant enough. The older man is a complete sweetheart who is happy to answer any questions you have. They also tend to remember repeat customers, which always does make you feel a bit more comfortable in a restaurant. Both of them make some of the biggest sandwich-wraps I've ever seen! They're absolutely packed! I was not expecting to be so completely stuffed from them.  The kofta, shawarma, and falafels here are all fantastic. Some of the best I've ever had, surprisingly enough for a little fast food place. The greens and potatos I've gotten haven't been very good, but since I tend to come late, I imagine that's just from being the end-of-the-day leftovers that have sat too long, I bet they're much fresher around lunch and dinner times. The prices are cheap, especially for how big the servings are!   The place is bigger than it looks from the outside, but there's rarely anyone in there when I go. Ambience is nice, it's a lot cleaner and better designed than most fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"Two stars for clean and friedly but they'll have to step it up at least a notch. Cold rice (and not lentils & rice either), Iceberg lettuce salad and altogether pretty mediocre. Friendly, cheap & clean but also bland and boring.  I hope they get it together"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is dirt cheap! I have tried the falafel, shwarma, and samosas. The couple that runs the place are friendly and helpful, and there is a wide variety of sauces and toppings for pitas.  For under $5 you can leave pita way satisfied and full, and you are supporting a local business!  EDIT: I know that this post is 4 years ago ;it is currently April 2014 but I have no memory of writing this post! Weird!  Also, this place is now \"Habibi\" and I don't like it! Go to Alexandria at Queen and Gwynne if you're in the Dufferin area."}
{"text":"First, I should mention that I am only reviewing the falafel pita, as it's the only thing I've had and will probably ever have from here. I say that because this falafel pita was a life changing experience, because prior to eating it I have only experienced dry and overly spiced falafels. It was crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, with all of the vegetables and tahini/hot sauce melding together to delight my taste buds with a multitude of flavours that were warm and cool, spicy and not. Being strapped for cash and in a rush that day, the \"falafel pita $3.99\" beckoned me to come in, and I was glad I did. Also, the place was really clean and pleasant, and the owner/cashier was great."}
{"text":"Good value, so-so shawarma.  There are better shawarma places 5 minutes further south on Yonge street."}
{"text":"Great price for a falafel wrap but not delicious :( The restaurant also smells like a grease pit and very smoky. It felt like I was looking through dirty sunglasses! It seems like there is no exhaust fan so the air was greasy and hazy.....disappointing...."}
{"text":"Downtown Toronto. It was raining out, I had no rental car, and I was hungry. The Hotel resto had high prices and no promise. I had noticed the Pita way when I arrived. At its worst, a place called \"Pita Way\" is going to have Gyros and/or Souvlaki. Even crappy Gyros/Souvlaki can be not too bad, so it became my dining choice for the evening.  The place is a shithole. In most cases, that would be a minus, but for a place called \"Pita Way\", it's a mark in the \"up\" column. There was one guy behind the counter doing everything. A steam table had a bunch of good looking stuff on it. There were a few fellas in front of me, who each ordered something different.  The counter guy took a white foam large clamshell and put some of the ordered meat in it, then proceeded to ask the orderee if he wanted this and that. By the end of it, he had put a little of just about everything  on the steam table into the box, completely covering the meat. On top of that came a few squirts of stuff from a few squeeze bottles, and a shake of herbs. I think he may even have thrown the guy's change on top of the huge mass of food that was groaning the clamshell.  Wow. I ordered the souvlaki, and then was waltzed through all the selections, and when it was done, I had a clamshell filled to the brim with rice, meat, hummus, tabbouleh, potatoes, veggies, and Allah knows what else. There was a hot sauce, and something that was like an aioli. It was all mushed together, and it was glorious! And cheap! I sat in a corner and wolfed it down, while an Arabic language station played on a tube teevee above my head. I had never had anything like it. I want to think this was an exotic foreign experience in a place I had to show my Passport to travel to, but I'm sure there's a parallel shithole in the Windy city that does the same thing. We tend to seek out shitholes when we're out of town in the name of \"local charm\" especially when we're in another country.  But home-grown shitholes are...shitholes. What spins the cognitive dissonance is: there are foreigners who patronize the places we would never go in, and they take those memories home as treasured. Go Figure."}
{"text":"This shawarma place isn't eyecatching but I was surprised to get a decent chicken shawarma (with meat cut from the spit) at Saturday midnight. The chicken Shawarma ($5~) was cooked to a crispy outer layer that's golden and tastes savory. The Wrap is pretty solid and well composed. Not much leakage while I was eating it, and not deformed like a folded omelette.There was also a TV in there playing top 40 vevo music videos."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a review about shawarma places because all of them are usually the same in terms of taste and environment. However, I'm happy to write a review about this place because this is the first shawarma place I've been to that is actually clean and the taste being above average! The store is well maintained; it's clean and organized. The menu includes beef & chicken pitas for $5.73+tax or beef & chicken plates for $9.73+tax. The plates come with salad and a choice of either rice or french fries.   I like this place and it's probably my go-to place for shawarma whenever I'm in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Most inexpensive meal I've had visiting Toronto and very tasty, too!  Ordered the special chicken schwarma pita with the works, owner made it fresh to order, was very friendly and made it very quickly."}
{"text":"Looking for cheap eats around King and Dufferin most people end up at one of the mega fast food chains, I on the other hand like to try and support small locally owned business. So when Pita Way opened up in the area I thought I'd give it a try. $1.99 for a falafel and $2.99 chicken shawarma, the prices here can't be beat and I'm happy to say the food quality is more than you'll pay for it.   This is a family owned business and the people there are super friendly. It's primarily a take out establishment though there is some seating in the back. You don't really come here for the decor, it's all about the food. You might be able to find a better falafel elsewhere but for $1.99 Pita Way's falafel is pretty darn good. Their chicken shawarma is awesome! People I've recommended the Pita Way to come back to me raving about the shawarma. Ingredients are fresh and the chicken is crispy and moist. For $2.99 forgetaboutit! Their dinner plates are basically an extension on their yummy sandwiches and quite affordable.   Knowing they're a family business with kids I almost wished they'd be able to raise their prices and still keep the customers flowing in. But they face a lot of local competition and most people in Parkdale seem all to happy to hit the $1.39 menu items at McD. At any rate, for now if your looking for some decent food on the go at an affordable price try Pita Way."}
{"text":"best pita place in town. the owners are incredibly humble and kind. great taste and high quality ingredients. the prices are quite low. tip them well, my friends!"}
{"text":"It was raining really hard and my boyfriend and I happened to pass by this place, so we decided to give this place a try and wait for rain to die down a bit. We ordered two shawarma. I have to say the meat was flavored but the sauces that you normally get in the shawarma wasn't there. I would say I definately had better."}
{"text":"I like this place because its affordable. But also yummy. And fast service.  I get the tuna pita for 3.99. They toast it it. I like the addition of chick peas and pickled beets (are they beets? I'm not even sure).  I'm getting hungry just writing this. Note to self, do not write yelp reviews late at night when hungry..."}
{"text":"cheapest falafel and shawarma around (starting at 2.99) and they have different sizes as well. I eaten here many times as well, the food taste good,l and the place is usually very quiet. However, I feel like at times the amount of food they put into the wraps depends on who is serving you."}
{"text":"The price is right. These brothers are excellent guys. The portions are huge. I always get the beef plate or chicken plate and I don't even need to eat dinner after. It's just good food.  Excellent place to grab a bite, I've probably gone here 30+ times. Run here, don't walk."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I ordered a falafel sandwich and was served these potato-looking nuggets that turned out to be tasteless, mystery-matter nuggets. The guy working there didn't seem to know why we were there dining...seemed not to be a real restaurant."}
{"text":"You know that expression \"if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is\"?  That's definitely the case with Pita Way.  I was walking along Carlton when I spotted a sign advertising a $3.99 Chicken Shawarma. $3.99!  I popped inside and placed my order, and waited while the sole clerk filled the other orders ahead of me. Honestly, if I'd known this was going to take almost 20 minutes, I wouldn't have even bothered.  I digress. I finally received my shawarma and took it to a nearby table. It's...not great.  For one thing, it's mostly cold inside. I watched as the clerk placed the finished wrap in a press for about 30 seconds, which did absolutely nothing to either crisp up the pita or warm up the cold ingredients.  And although four separate sauces were added to the shawarma, it was completely lacking in any of the bold flavors one associates with this dish. The other ingredients were fine, I guess, and the chicken itself did contain a few crispy pieces, but the experience of eating this concoction was far from enjoyable.  I did finish it, but that's 'cause I'm a pig."}
{"text":"Very good food at a very reasonable price. Perfect for students on a budget.  Tried the chicken shawarma wrap for only $3.99 + tax, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street and as such, after getting mighty sick of Japanese and Subway, I decided to check out Pita Way. The first time I went over, my pita was pretty good. Well put together, no sauce leaking out the bottom, good price and grilled to make it nice and hot.  I went again last night and was blown away. One of the best shwarma I've ever had!  I'll start off by saying that this place is owned by what looks to be a wife and husband team; more often than not, the wife is there on her own. She's super nice, quiet but friendly and she makes a mean pita. The first time I watched her put it together, I mentally thought \"there's not enough STUFF inside that pita\" and i thought I would be hungry afterwards. No way - packed to the brim and perfectly filling (a few times, I haven't been able to finish it).  The menu here is pretty basic, they have chicken shwarma wrap, beef shwarma wrap, chicken shwarma plate, beef shwarma plate and of course falafel. But quite frankly, if they had more than that, they probably would have products that weren't that good. Stick to what you know :)  I get just about everything in my pita except the hot peppers and this time no onions. The hot sauce has some good bite but wasn't overly spicy (good for me!) and the mix of tahini and whatever other sauces there were was perfect. They cooked the shwarma again on a hot cooktop and put it all together - YUM. Can't get any better, just the right amount of everything in my pita.   You can pay debit or cash (credit is probably accepted to as they have the interac machine) and there's seating in the restaurant with a big tv too."}
{"text":"Often empty... for a reason.... Waiters do not care about customers here. I went there at 11pm, there were only 2 customers waiting for their order and the waiter did not even acknowledge me, while preparing the order of my two fellow customers. After 5 minute of gentle wait and being invisible, I left.   Time to notice that at 11pm, they were out of several items, includign tabouli. Lebanese Express is around the corner on Yonge, with nicer waiters and constantly fresh and full racks of food. Bye Pita Way or improve your customer service (and install a/c)."}
{"text":"When you are working 13 consecutive 12 hour shifts and you work in Parkdale, you have to change it up a bit!  The falafel I tried was good but maybe next time I will as for a lot less parsley. For under $5, the price was right and the guy at the cash was nice."}
{"text":"Solid 3.  Beef shawarma was tasty and well dressed.  Good value at $5.50 (tax included) and a worthwhile option in this area."}
{"text":"After several run-ins with bad shawarma joints, I'm glad to have finally found a decent, fresh, clean, yummy place."}
{"text":"I was stumbling down Carleton St. late one night looking for a falafel fix.  Not literally stumbling, more like shuffling.  Whatever.  I found what I was looking for, in the form of Pita Way, their monstrous mustachioed signage beckoning me in.  Even at 10pm, the falafel tasted fresh and delicious.  The location boasts a lot of seating and is open late. Service was solid and friendly. I can't wait to go back and try their other options.  Obligatory Title Pun: Where there's a PITA there's a WAY.  Menu Readability: I don't remember. I came in (shuffled, really) and said \"falafel.\" I only assume they have other options.  Need to mention: Cash only.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll admit it. I shuffle."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a couple times and finally went in a tried it. As a start I went with the Chicken Shawarma.  I don't remember Carrots being added to a Shawarma and a lettuce toss salad was added as well. Why not it is the 1st time. While mine was being prepared a guy walked up to the counter and told the the guy at the cash \"I need a fork, my shawarma broke\".  A sign of things to come.  So I went outside and had a couple bites. Was I ever LET DOWN. No flavor at all. I've never had such a bland shawarma before and i'm not picky. The chicken tasted like pieces were cut up and thrown in a pan (actually that is what happened, I thought it was being heated up). The hot sauce wasn't hot, the lettuce toss salad didn't work and yes my shawarma ended up falling a part, a 1st for me. So no need to try anything else there.   The plus side, the place was clean so you get 1 star.  No way to Pita Way"}
