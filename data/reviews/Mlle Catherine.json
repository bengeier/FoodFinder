{"text":"Best gelato in Montreal.  Bilboquet and Kem Coba are fantastic but this tops them.  Great location in old Montreal.  Almond and chocolate/hazelnut are both tops!"}
{"text":"Nutella soft serve, dark chocolate \"dip cone\" shell... Fantastic! Long line but it moved quickly enough. Great spot for a late desert!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream in old Montreal with tons of different hard shell dips. I tried both the dark chocolate and milk sea salt - both delicious! Of the many ice cream shops to choose from in Montreal I'd highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves sweets and especially liked this place. She chose a sugar cone with salted caramel ice cream dipped in dark chocolate. She said it was one of the best she'd had...and she's had a few in her 13 years. They serve coffees and pastries and shakes too. The place is quite cute with comfortable outdoor seating. Not to be missed if your sweet tooth is calling."}
{"text":"Small but cute shop with seating both inside and out. I ordered the Mini soft serve with vanilla and caramel flavored soft serve. The soft serve was not too sweet and definitely tasted of caramel. I enjoyed it very much. Staff are friendly and helpful. Would love to visit again."}
{"text":"Loved this spot!  For those NYers, I'd say this spot is better than Big Gay's soft serve.  While BG has more clever creations, the ice cream here is better.  A bit on the pricier side, which is why I took off a star.  Cute decor."}
{"text":"Sooo incredibly simple and delicious and you can dip your cone in sea salt caramel or Ferrero Rochero chocolate. Everything is made fresh. It bums me out that people would choose boring Ben and Jerrys next door over this place. We visited from Chicago and stopped here twice."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting more than just Carvel-style soft serve. The salted caramel dip was very good but the peanut butter dip was kind of tasteless. The sugar cones were stale tasting too. I would have been happier next door at B&J's."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my family after the fireworks one night. This place is in the middle of everything, on the square in Old Montreal, right next to Ben & Jerry's. Great seating options inside and outside. Super cute shop, innovative flavors and really friendly staff. We went to all the gelato/ice cream places in Montreal that are much ballyhoo-ed, and we thought this one was the best!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny, but it has the cutest window overlooking the cutest outdoor patio overlooking a plaza!  The gelato was delicious, the coffee was well-caffeinated, and there was WiFi! Great place for a pick me up on a very touristy day of exploring Montreal."}
{"text":"Had their raspberry and mango hard ice cream. Was amazing! The raspberry had small seeds in it (im guessing it was from the raspberries themselves) which gave it a unique texture. This place doesn't really have seating inside, but maybe 5 tables outside. The line gets pretty long when it's nice out!"}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise!  I was looking for somewhere to enjoy gelato.  There are a lot of places near Place Jacques-Cartier for ice cream and desserts.  But I decided to visit this place.  When they told me they made their own softserve and I get a choice of dip for my cone, I was sold.  They had a choice of vanilla and pistachio or a swirl of the two.  I chose the swirl the salted caramel dip.  It was great, in the sitting area near the window was an excellent place to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Ice cream was good. Really good for not to sweet type of ice cream. Half dipped ice cream rather than full dipped due to it  over powering the ice cream. Overall really great place to try out if youre from out of town."}
{"text":"Small, cute and cheap - I'm in love! I stumbled upon this small cafe while touring Montreal.  The decor is very IG-worthy with its palette of pastel colours, framed pictures of dolled up ice cream and the oh so selfie-worthy front display.  This front display consists of a pink road bike and a multicoloured platform for people to take photos with their desserts in front of the store.  Unfortunately, it was raining, so I didn't take a shot at the front display, but it's on my bucket list for the future. 

The prices here are very fair for being in a tourist area. You get soft serve dipped in chocolate for 3-5 dollars depending on the size you get. The sizes are very generous as well since I felt that my medium sized cone was almost akin to a large. Their ice cream flavours are limited, but they have a whole plethora of chocolate dips, including Ferrero Rocher chocolate, caramel chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, Oreo chocolate, dark chocolate, etc.  Even though the ice cream choices are limited their dips add a kick to the flavour.  This is because the chocolate dip hardens almost instantly, leaving you with a nice chocolate shell to bite into to get to the soft serve core.  

I got the hazelnut soft serve in medium with a peanut butter chocolate dip and my bf got the hazelnut soft serve in the smallest size with the Ferrero Rocher dip. Both were seriously bomb and were one of the best soft serves we've ever had. If I didn't have a lunch to go to, I would have grabbed a second cone! 

My bf also had a mochaccino and it had a deep coffee flavour that melded well with the  chocolate undertones.  He admits this was the best mochaccino he's ever had as it didn't feel artificial at all and had a good balance between the chocolate and coffee notes. 

We were thoroughly impressed with the coffee and iced desserts at this cafe. When we are back in this niche of Montreal, we'll be hitting it up again!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best dessert spot on Jacques Cartier' place! This cute and tiny place offers very little choice but they're the real deal: their ice creams are not too sweet with a real taste (specially chocolate!). Try their dark chocolate soft ice cream, and their Ferrero rocher dipping sauce, simply delicious! Also a plus: they have a little patio right outside with probably the most comfortable seating in the area!"}
{"text":"This cute dessert shop is located right in the middle of bustling Old Montreal. After hours of touring the city, this ice cream shop seemed like the perfect stop. We ordered a few soft served dipped in chocolate; however, the shop offered crepes and lemonades that looked equally as appealing.

If the weather is nice, this shop has a lovely patio area with a direct view of the square center. On the day we visited, there were acrobats performing in the middle which made for the perfect entertainment to enjoy with our ice cream."}
{"text":"SO glad we stopped and looked here before going to the ice cream shop next door. 
If you're a fan of anything dipped ice cream cones- this is the place you want to try!
Service was fast and easy to look at the menu, price was around $6 for the dipped cone. 
Will come back next time we do a trip there!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is too cute!!! I went here before bike riding near the canal and it was the perfect pit stop for ice cream. The girl that was working was so lovely and worked so hard she was alone and it was busy but man she's the bees knees, she really did a great job and was super patient when talking to American customers who don't understand french. I could sit here all day and eat ice cream and people watch. This is a must see place!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed! I was biking in the old port, when I arrived at Place Jacques-Cartier, I was tempted by the cute setting and the dipped ice cream. I ordered a small vanilla ice cream dipped in salted caramel milk chocolate. It looked much better than what it tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Cutest decor and sweetest creamery! Tried their soft serve swirl of dark chocolate and vanilla- tasty but slightly pricy. The mango sorbet was refreshing choice too."}
{"text":"Just remembering how creamy and satisfying the mango gelato here was makes me want to go back! This place is pretty small and doesn't have a lot of options, but the choices they DO offer you do not disappoint. The interior is also very cute and trendy. Servers were very friendly and I also thought the logo on their cup was really cute."}
{"text":"The soft serve pistachio ice cream was amazing!!

It's at a very convenient location and easy to find.  Limited seating but there's really no need to sit down.  You can definitely get your ice cream and walk around rather than stay seated.  

The staff there were nice and service was fast.  Note that there was a handwritten  sign that said \"cash only\", while a credit card machine was right next to the sign.  So bring cash with you just in case.  

I haven't had the pleasure to try any other flavors or their sorbets, but if given the opportunity I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some sorbet or ice cream, and went here since it's close to where I work. I had their mango sorbet and thought that it was a bit expensive for a small cup of sorbet... but I guess it's in a very touristy area so that justifies the price.

I also thought that the sorbets were too sweet for my taste, to the point where I didn't want the rest. Maybe I'll try their other ice cream later."}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest stores I've seen in Old Port!! The location is perfect, right at the front of Old Port, and the decor of the store is very artsy and adorable (perfect for a photo haha). I had the vanilla soft serve dipped in their Ferrero Rocher chocolate dip and it was delicious! I highly recommend it for a dessert stop during a visit to Old Port."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!  Stopped by here for gelato...or was it ice cream???  Well, it was cold and delicious!  The girl that was working was very sweet! I think she gave us a little more cause the cups were pretty full!  There was a Ben & Jerry's a couple doors down...but why go somewhere like that since you can do that in the U.S."}
{"text":"Stopped in here twice over the course of one weekend while exploring Old Montreal. It's a tiny little shop but full of cuteness and deliciousness. They're primarily known as an ice cream shop but they also have a lovely little espresso drink selection, which I took advantage of the first time I went in. It was a cold day so I wasn't in the mood for ice cream, but a hot latte sounded divine. The coffee was tasty and the perfect pick-me-up as I wandered around the neighborhood.

The next day I was in the area and couldn't get those beautiful dipped soft serve cones out of my head so, since it was a bit warmer, I knew I had to get one. I treated myself to a swirled vanilla/salted caramel cone dipped in dark chocolate. OH YESSSS. The bittersweet chocolate was a nice contrast against the rich vanilla ice cream and the caramel swirl added a nice saltiness that helped ground the whole cone. So simple but so good. There's a DQ across the square but skip it. This is the only dipped cone you need! 

Attn: vegans and the lactose intolerant, you can enjoy this too as they do have a few dairy free sorbet flavors to choose from. 

FYI: No credit. Debit or cash only!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I loved this soft serve!! It was soooo good! I wanted to try other places throughout the day, but I wouldn't have had a shred of shame in me to go here two or three times in a day! I got the mixed vanilla and maple soft serve dipped in ferrero rocher and it was pure heavenly deliciousness!!! I'm dying to have another. I will definitely be back and this will be one of the first places I visit! Sorry about the quality of the picture, I had to zoom in."}
{"text":"Cute place. Good gelato. Good variety. Good location. Nice seating. Fair prices. Stopped in while walking in Old Montreal, and had a very good experience. They let you do multiple flavor a for multi-scoop dishes, which, although fairly standard, is also appreciated."}
{"text":"A super cute little store for ice creams and gelato. I got a mini soft serve which serves you the right amount of ice cream just to taste.

They have unique collection of cones with cute little decor. Hello kitty, fruit loops n stuffs like that... 

The ice cream was creamy and had right hints of sweetness. The berry gelato was too good and my little one finished the whole cup...

They also have milkshakes!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little ice cream spot in old Montreal. They have a really ig worthy patio with pastel colours. You can sit on the patio though it's more of a grab and go store. Overall a really nice storefront. 

You're greeted by the friendly staff upon entering. I believe the soft serve flavours are changed on a weekly/monthly basis as when I went they had coffee soft serve - but other reviews have different flavours. 

I opted for the twist version and got mine dipped in peanut butter chocolate while my friend got a milk chocolate dip. 

The ice cream was refreshing and creamy. The coffee flavour was spot on and tasted so good! Not to mention that peanut butter chocolate coating...it was unbelievable! 

I'll definitely be back to try other flavours though I wish I could know in advance what they have. 

The price point is a bit high, but nothing unreasonable for what ice cream costs now. 

Oh and btw make sure you bring debit or cash as they don't accept credit cards! 

In all a solid spot for some ice cream on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Though not very famous nor very advertised, Mlle Catherine is actually an amazing crémerie located at Jacques-Cartier Square. Their dark chocolate dip is REALLY rich and impressive, and they offer vanilla, caramel, mango, etc. soft serve as the inside ice-cream of the dip, my two visits there were more than satisfying :)"}
{"text":"Cute ice cream shop tucked into Old Montreal! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my, our mini dip was AMAZING!!
Thank you yelp for directing me to this delicious ice cream place. We had a mini dip - coffee and vanilla ice cream dipped into dark chocolate. It was so rich and creamy. I don't even like sweets anymore, but I wish I could get an ice cream here whenever I wanted! This place is CASH ONLY. We had to go to the ATM in the middle of the purchase!"}
{"text":"Mango gelato was very refreshing recommend it! The soft serve you can taste the great quality and effort they put in making their ice cream. 
Very nice lady at the cash, service was great."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have several dip flavors, multiple cone types & they're quick and delicious! I would definitely be a regular if I lived here! I love that they have pistachio soft serve! And they have several dip choices and cone choices! The rochero dip and the maple white chocolate dip were my two favorites!"}
{"text":"Ouvert tard ce qui est apprecié, qq choix classiques de creme glacé, qq tables à l'interieur, du sucre partout."}
