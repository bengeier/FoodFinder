{"text":"The food is good, the service is even better. When I sent 80% of my dinner (green curry) in to be boxed up to take home, one of the women (owner?) came out to check if my meal was okay, and why I had not devoured it. I reassured her that it was good, I was just truly full from a late lunch. She then proceeded to bring out two free drinks (milky green tea- delish!). That kind of concern and service isn't seen all the time and was appreciated!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, location, prices, flavors, are all fantastic here!  Portion sizes are also adequate.  It's cash only but that doesn't bother me as we just come prepared.  I'm giving it three stars because it would be nice to have a choice of something besides spring roll with the lunch and although the flavors are good there seems to be a lack of variety when it comes to the veggies.  There are a lot of peas, carrots, broccoli, etc. and non of the often desired veggies that often show up in Thai cuisine such as napa cabbage, bok choy, etc.  If they spiced up the veggie options the food would be superb!  It's really refreshing to have a BYOB option in the North Hills and I love the little patio they have outside.  I know they haven't been there that long but I imagine once they take some time to really get that set up, maybe add some ivy etc. to block out road and noise it could be quite nice.  I know Pusadees Garden in Lawrenceville does just that with their small outdoor space and they are always packed.  People love a nice outside atmosphere and this place certainly has potential for that!"}
{"text":"A delicious northern Thai restaurant with fabulous atmosphere tucked up right in my 'hood.
Intimate and outdoor seating with BYOB and cash only (ATM located in the entrance)."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food. I think one of my favorite things about this place is when I do takeout orders of pad Thai, they separate the carrots and the bean sprouts! This is so convenient for me because I'm not big on carrots in my pad Thai so I can just shove those aside and add the bean sprouts as I like! (I'm fine with bean sprouts but some places add way too much in, so it's really nice that I can just add them in as I go).  Their pad kee Mao is fab too!"}
{"text":"I am so happy we decided to try this place. We ordered the crab rangoon for an appetizer. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly. I ordered chicken pineapple stir fry with cashews. It was definitely worth going back. Everything was cooked fast and tasted delicious! Service was great too, very friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed the wonderful dumplings and Pad Thai! Excellent, well prepared and presented. While it is quite a drive to their location, this is our now go to Thai restaurant. Willing to say it is the best in Pittsburgh!! Just a note to the owners: hours of operation need to be corrected on website, Yelp and any other locations. Drove to restaurant on Sunday afternoon and was closed."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Thai place in the north hills. Service is very fast and friendly.
Food is always delicious! How can I complain about a place that has your food ready in less then 15 minutes of your call?! Prices are more than descent for the amount of food you get, I always have left over food for the following day! I highly recommend. However , be prepared it's cash only but they do have a atm located in the restaurant.
Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. See ew is the best we've had in a while. Quick and easy take out service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly efficient service rendered in a spacious dining area. I've had Thai many places and this is one of the best.  Really enjoyed the steamed pork dumplings which had layers of flavors beautifully enhanced with the sauce. Massman curry with chicken was plentiful and thick sauced. 5 spice is a bit hotter than other places but not unbearable. 
The owners are really working hard to please and delivering on those efforts. We will make the 18 mile trip and visit again this winter."}
{"text":"Very disappointing since the first time we ate here we loved it.  Since then we've ordered take out twice and it has been awful both times. Both the pad Thai and pad see ew are basically flavorless and the noodles are way over cooked. The food is also priced a little high. We won't be going back, which is really unfortunate because we were really looking forward to having a good Thai restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best Tom Kha Noodle Soup! Friendly staff, food is full of flavor, and clean environment. BYOB establishment."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch, ordered the Le Thai Noodles with shrimp from the \"specialty\" menu section and it was delicious! Husband had green curry chicken and he was pleased as well. I think we have been here three times and each time has been a very positive experience. They do take credit cards now which is also nice. Great relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, great food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise to find this gem in a nearby neighborhood. The food, service and atmosphere will bring me back again. The 3 of us ordered a variety of menu items and all were fantastic. BYOB."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food! Great Staff! Nice atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating. Cash Only! BYOB. Love it"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Pittsburgh. In addition to amazing food, the restaurant is beautifully and tastefully decorated and everyone who works there is gracious and polite.We always feels so welcome at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  The food was great. The ambiance was great.  The help was warm and friendly.  We plan to return on a regular basis.

The details:  For appetizers, we tried the Crispy Spring Rolls on our first visit and the Chicken Satay on our second.  Both were delicious and the ingredients were 100% fresh.  So far we've tried the Pad Thai (with chicken), the Pumpkin Curry (with grilled chicken), and the Pad Kraw Paw.   Once again, the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were distinct and pleasing.  Tried one of their homemade chocolate french pastrries and it went down well.   

VERY reasonably priced.   BYOB is an additional savings.

Has gotten popular quickly.  I suggest you make reservations."}
{"text":"Visited seven months after our original trip and I am happy to report that we were pleasantly surprised! Hooray!  The  menu has been updated and increased with everyone's favorites. We got take-out and found the portions to be enormous. Everything was totally delicious! We will certainly be back. FYI - cash only."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's different for the location, the people are really nice, and the food is really good.  Took a star off for cash payment only, for very limited English understanding which makes for wrong orders quite often, and the prices can be sort of steep.  Otherwise, I really like the spot.  We have ordered takeout as well.  Recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE it here!  Very cute and cozy.  It is BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee. We've been here once a week since we found it! We hate to give up our little secret but we want people to experience it too. The decor is charming!  Very good food, and friendly service. They do accept credit cards now too."}
{"text":"Finally a great Thai restaurant in Shaler.  I've had takeout and also dined on site and was very satisfied every time.  Pineapple and pumpkin curry are awesome!  I would definitely recommend.  Service was excellent and takeout orders are available on a timely basis.  I love that it is also a BYOB."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service was so slow that my passport expired while I was waiting for my meal."}
{"text":"Really good Pad Thai.  We have only done take out but it is always ready in 5 minutes.  Definitely a go to takeout place."}
{"text":"We had a green curry at 5 of 10, and the pumpkin curry at 1.  Both were flavorful, and all fresh vegetables.
The servings were enough for leftovers.  
We also sat on the patio which was lovely this time of year.  There was a bit of traffic in spurts, though.
The owners are super sweet and friendly.
It's in a neighborhood, too, a nice drive and setting.
The to-go bins are recycle-able plastic,too, not styrofoam."}
{"text":"Very delicious. I had the pumpkin curry and I couldn't be more satisfied. 
The staff if very nice as well!
Cash only but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"Been here a few times during a weekday lunch. Comfortable even with a 2 year old - she liked the pad thai noodles. Great service. Also got the dessert plate once - I was thinking it would be a muffin from the bakery on a plate. Instead it was beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"First, it's 2015 and they don't take cards? Seriously? So you have to get cash from their handy ATM, adding about $5 to the cost of your meal. Service Was very slow, made all the worse by the fact that the place was unbearably hot. When the food finally came...to be kind, I will call it mediocre. There is MUCH better Thai to be had, even in the north hills."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I get food from here about 3-4x a month (eat-in and take out) and Le Thai Cafe has yet to disappoint. I have tried a good portion of the menu and everything has been delicious!! The service is very quick and friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I highly recommend as it is a hidden gem and a nice change in the North Hills!"}
{"text":"It was good but not great. The atmosphere was very unique and comfortable. We happened to be the only ones there that evening which was a little awkward but that's not a problem. I hoped for a bit more variety on the menu but everything was tasty. Bear in mind that it is cash only. I'd go back but honestly I prefer K Asian Bistro which is a few miles north. I'd go back and wouldn't discourage anyone from going for a more romantic environment than other Asian restaurants (rice shaped like a heart!)"}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin chicken curry. Very good. Very fast service quite a large place.
Remember Cash Only"}
{"text":"We live nearby and we order from this place frequently.  We love the Pad Thai, pineapple curry, and Le Thai Noodles. You can specify spice level.  Excellent and fresh!"}
{"text":"I am currently in Chiang Mai, Thailand and I can honestly say that Le Thai Cafe is just as good, if not better than anything that you can get in the Thai homeland.  Sure, you don't get the amazing experience of walking out onto Mount Royal Blvd and almost getting a limb removed by a dozen crazy motorbikes coming at you like a swarm of angry bees, but you certainly get a wonderful, authentic cultural experience while you are dining in the restaurant...and you most definitely will not get diarrhea, which I can't say for the homeland. 

I highly recommend the green curry.  I've asked for green curry at 3 different places while in Thailand and have not yet found a single one better than Le Thai Cafe.   Thailand is a beautiful country that you should visit if you want to hang out with elephants, go on a jungle hike, or buy a fake Rolex, but if all you want is an amazing Thai dinner...I say go to Pittsburgh.

PS: I haven't seen a single Crab Rangoon on any menu over here but who gives a damn, they're delicious.  Add it to the order."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the North Hills.  I had the Pad Thai w/ chicken and it's AWESOME.  Honestly, I'd say it's about as good as Nicky's Pad Thai. Only thing is that it's not as spicy. I ordered a 10 and that probably converts to a 7 at Nicky's. It's clean, quiet, BYOB. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in Pittsburgh, every flavor was bright, balanced and fresh. We had crab rangoons, dumplings, chicken Pad Thai, and beef Tom Yum. Everything was extremely good. Our server was so sweet and attentive. They had cute Halloween decorations our 4 year old son loved. We sat on the patio which had many live plants and a water fountain. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yeah! Nice little restaurant in an area that needs more restaurants!! And a Thai restaurant that DELIVERS?? No way!  Yup!
Wicked cold out and nothing in the house to eat... whats this, Yelp? Order for delivery - le Thai cafe??
For sure!!
Delicious broths, curries and I am addicted to the steamed dumplings which are sui mai dim sum style but with a sweet dipping sauce - delectable.
Thank you le Thai Cafe for being there and for being quite yummy."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time here.  What a shame that not more come to check it out.  I loved the Sunrise Tofu with the peanut curry sauce.  I specified a spiciness level of 7 and it was just right.  My husband wasn't crazy about the ginger-flavored shrimp (can't remember what it was called) but it was more of a personal preference.  He said it was actually pretty good and definitely a hit with somebody who likes that flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious,  clean, inviting, and peaceful spot to stop to just relax and take in some tea. Each Room is decorated differently and you'll find visual surprises around every corner. Outside patios and special tables for two for that one of a kind romantic dinner.  Staff was over the top kind, and helpful! The food is fresh and absolutely delicious!  It's about time we had a great thai place near here! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife and thought it was excellent. You could really tell they use quality ingredients. The other thing is the portions are huge - so we both ended up taking a good amount of food home. Overall a nice place to eat with a lot going for it, great food, good prices, big portions."}
{"text":"First time visiting-everything was delicious. Started with spring rolls and fresh rolls. Entrees of pineapple fried rice, green curry and sunrise tofu. Ended with an extra special mango and sticky rice. Everything was very well made. Would re-order everything! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Let's start at the top. This place has the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. It is flavorful, expertly cooked and always delicious. In fact, everything i've ever gotten from there has been delicious. So why not 5 stars? 

Well, the service leave a bit to be desired. In the past I've had to get my own silverware, to go boxes and sauces. No one seems able to get spice levels correct and sometimes, once in a great while, I will be brought the complete wrong dish. What I'm brought is still, without fail, delicious, but still, come on. 

I highly recommend this place, but only if you're patient and willing to go along for the ride."}
{"text":"I was really pleased to recently discover a non-dive bar takeout place near my family's home in the north hills. It's slim pickings there for dining out! I was staying with my youngest siblings for a week while my mother was out of town, and one day I ordered us all some takeout from Le Thai Café  so they could get a taste of Thai food.

We chose some Thai fried rice as well as Pad Thai, both with chicken. I ordered over the phone and had everything picked up within ten minutes. The interior was clean and cute, and the service was friendly. I would definitely come back and eat-in if I was ever in the neighborhood for an extended period of time again. The fried rice had a higher spice level than expected, but it was delicious nonetheless. The Pad Thai was incredible honestly! The sauce had a savory undertone that was addicting...I haven't tasted any other version of the dish quite like it in a while. Usually Pad Thai is way too sweet. Both portions were generous and lasted for at least two meals. I will get takeout again from here at any rate, even if I'm just stopping by for a quick visit to my family."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here on a Friday. My fiance has eaten here a few times since opening (5 minutes away from our house!) and has been raving about it. Since I am usually a Nicky's fan for Thai food in the city, I was skeptical. I had the basic chicken Pad Thai with a 5 on the spice scale. It was VERY good and they gave us SO much food it took two days for us to eat it! While it is a bit pricy for some items on the menu, I was impressed with how good the pad thai was, so for me it was worth the $20+ dollars we spent for 2 take out entrees. The 5 was spicy for me, and just on the verge of being a little too spicy, but it was really delicious and not an overwhelming heat at all. Will definitely be visiting again and Im so glad its right down the street!"}
{"text":"What a cool, quirky little place with a very friendly hostess/waitress!  It is nothing special to look at outside, but inside, there are many interesting and attractive pieces of art/junque everywhere, bright colors, plants, and huge windows.  The entire restaurant is very clean.  There is ample, free parking to the side and back of Le Thai Cafe.  BTW, while the location may initially seem as if it is in the middle of nowhere, it is fairly close to Ross Park Mall and McCandless Crossing.
We came for lunch and were not disappointed.  We are Pad Thai junkies, so, of course, that was what we ordered - he had the Beef Pad Thai and I ordered the Shrimp (both were $2 upcharges).  Despite the menu stating that lunch came with an egg roll, a small salad arrived at our table, composed of greens (no iceberg lettuce - YEA!), shredded carrot, red onion and a tasty dressing.  Our Pad Thai dishes were delivered hot and attractively plated.  The sauce on the rice noodles was a pinkish color and pleasant tasting, although a little sweeter than we are accustomed.  Just a note: you might want to dial back your typical spice level.  We always request a 7 for me and he likes a 5; we both thought that our meals were very, very spicy - although not too spicy to still be enjoyable.  We will go with #5 and #3 levels on our next visit - which will be soon!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while searching for another restaurant. It was not very busy and was a very warm evening. We were seated in a through way next to a broken down aquarium in very uncomfortable chairs; the table was 'sticky'.  It felt like the a/c must've been broken as the air was stuffy. Our service was below average to say the least. We were brought glasses of water and our ordered meals. Period. That's it. No, \"how is your meal?, would you like anything else?\"
I ordered the chicken Pad Thai (which was oddly sweet) and my wife ordered the red curry. She loved her curry and mine was just okay. The spring rolls were fairly good, but there are definitely places around town that serve better. This place is not bad, but again. There are better Thai restaurants around town."}
{"text":"As I write this I feel like I'm telling you a secret. I'm mostly afraid that it will get so popular that I won't be able to even get in. If the rest of Pittsburgh only knew about this adorable little restaurant. It is the epitome of a \"hidden gem\" in the North Hills. I frequently find myself wishing for the Pad See Ew, which was amazing. I'm looking forward to trying everything on the menu, but the memory of the Pad See Ew will probably drive me to order it every time. It's that good. My husband got a vegetable curry, and I was impressed by it, but I was so busy scarfing down the Pad See Ew that I didn't even care how good his was."}
{"text":"Like eating Thai food in houses converted to restaurants*?  Then Le Thai Cafe could be the place for you! This is a charming place tucked into the northern suburbs, and its food go toe to toe with [insert name of another popular Pittsburgh Thai restaurant here] any day.  I had samosas (at a Thai place? what??), spring rolls, pad thai, and the spicy green beans.  Funny enough, the pad thai was ordered at a fairly low spice level and the spicy green beans weren't given any extra consideration, and the pad thai was spicier!  But all was good.  The service was fine, although I've heard from a regular that even though they are always cordial, they sometimes bring you a completely different dish than you ordered, haha. Also, it's BYOB, so feel free to bring a nice bottle of Riesling like my date did.

*My statement isn't based in factual knowledge.  I just get the strong vibe from the location and layout of this place that it wasn't originally built as a restaurant, but hey, I could be wrong."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night and brought our wine ($3 per). It was a nice night and we sat outside in a very nice outdoor setting surrounded by flowers and plants. Also a small pool with gold fish and trickling water. Jules was our waiter who did a nice service and was very informative. Food is very good Thai food. I ordered my very hot and it was very hot. The steamed dumplings were excellent as well as my cashew nut. My wife had le Thai noodles chef special which was also very good. Large servings. Tom yum soup very authentic and good. The inside is a very pretty and stylish setting. Casual elegant with different tables and seating areas. Really impressed with this restaurants food and decor. Will return and is recommended."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! A real-life non-bar, non-diner, non-fast food restaurant in Glenshaw. If only this were a more regular occurrence in our little piece of suburbia. Le Thai Cafe has been open less than a month. It was the former Cafe Venice. The new owners completely transformed the space from tacky italian to rustic chic! The prices are fair with stir fried noodle dishes starting at $9 with no protein and $13 if you'd like chicken, tofu, beef or shrimp. They also have a selection of Thai salads, fried rice, noodle soups, as well as appetizers. 

We ordered each of the 4 appetizers on the menu and enjoyed them all. The appetizers are Crispy Spring Rolls, Fresh Rolls, Chicken Satay, and Moo Yang (Thai bbq pork skewers). Portions were reasonable and each app cost $5-$7.

Another perk of this place. Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee! These are go-to beverages when we visit our other thai-favorite Pusadee's, so we were excited to see them on the menu here as well. Better yet, they were only $2 a glass! The restaurant is also BYOB for those who'd like to have some wine.

For dinner, I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken, a stir fried noodle dish with wide noodles, eggs, broccoli and carrots. The portion was large enough that I took about half of it home for lunch the next day. It was full of flavor and the vegetables weren't overdone and still had great crunch. I found that getting the spice at a #3 was just enough for me. 

There were 7 of us dining that night and our bill was only $160, which is a super reasonable, especially since that includes multiple appetizers and a few thai iced teas and coffees. 

The only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, was that since they are newly opened, they are still trying to figure out the system that works best for them. Service was a little slow, but the owner of the restaurant recognized this and apologized twice throughout our dinner, telling us that it will get better as they get their bearings. 

We can't wait to come back again and hope to become regulars here. Three cheers to Le Thai Cafe!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch for the first time on Thursday around 1130am. We were greeted by a very friendly Thai greeter/waitress. The place seemed small at first until we were led into the main dining rooms. The place was clean, open, decorated great, and ambiance was peaceful and chill (the music was relaxing and positive). The waitress was very kind and prompt. She recommended some items from the menu; the lunch specials had some great deals! 

I got the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with tofu and my wife got Steamed Dumplings for our appetizers. We also got complimentary Spring Rolls with the lunch specials! For the main dish, I got Basil Chicken, which was recommended by the waitress and Yelp reviewers, and my wife got Pad Thai with vegetables and tofu. 

The soup was so fresh, tasty, and flavorful. Not too salty and just the right amount of heat. The dumplings tasted homemade (not pre-frozen) and were delectable and flavorful. The Spring Rolls with the sauce were good as well. However, the rolls and dumplings could have been a little larger - the taste made up for this. 

Lastly, the main courses were amazing. My Basil Chicken used such fresh ingredients and was cooked perfectly. The flavors could all be tasted and were perfectly combined; the lunch portion size was decent too. My wife's Pad Thai was cooked perfectly as well. The noodles weren't too greasy and the flavors were great. The only con of the Pad Thai was there wasn't really any vegetables in it, only small slivers or carrots and green onions.

All in all, our experience was very enjoyable and the food was bomb. We will definitely be revisiting this place, especially if our plans to buy a house 5 minutes away go through! Keep up the good work Le Thai Cafe!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin curry chicken is our main dish here, but the pineapple curry, any fried rice, and chicken satay are also favorites. We pick up from here pretty often and always appreciate how fast they are..10 minutes tops. This really is a very pleasant place, and I hope they continue to do well. Also, the decor a beautiful."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Thai. Always good, the restaurant has a nice ambience and the food is excellent. I am partial the the Pumpkin Red Curry and always start with their yummy fresh rolls. You can't beat the lunch prices."}
{"text":"Such a great place for being so close to home!  The service was spot on and the curry was delicious.  The portions are just right for the price as well.  I would like to have seen a few more crab Rangoon in the appetizer, but overall everything was fantastic!  Make sure you bring cash as it is cash only."}
{"text":"Pretty great Thai food. Cash only, BYOB. Friendly service with a great atmosphere. There was a bit of confusion with the reservation and slightly slow service, but it was also pretty busy, so that's understandable. We got the fresh rolls appetizer, which was a good portion and very fresh. Followed it with curries and a couple other entree dishes. All were very good in taste and portion.

While it wasn't the best Thai I've ever had, it was in my top ten. Maybe slightly overpriced, but the BYOB helps and corking fee was only $3.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place, can't get there as often as we like, the services good the atmosphere is good the food is great, they also let you bring your own bottle, excellent food excellent service I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The Le Thai noodles...why I even questioned them, I have no clue.  They were EXCELLENT.  A must try!  Tom Kha was tasty and full of yummy things and I mean FULL - no skimping here.  Delicious.  Pad Thai was perfection.  Great wait staff and charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered pickup shrimp pad Thai, which is I suppose my weed-out meal for Thai places.  It was good.  But...different.  I've never had sweet (almost like honey had been added) pad Thai before.  And it wasn't SWEET...but there was a sweetness too it.  No lime.  No cilantro.  I was surprised.  It was still good, but not really something I'd order again.  That said...it's like 5 minutes from my house!!  

So I have to go back and try it again.  Pad Thai is just one thing.  Maybe their curry is out of this world?  Maybe sweet pad Thai is like the most authentic pad Thai there is, and all these other haters have been making theirs wrong.  I don't know.  I'm not Thai.  It was good, but not...what I expected (wanted).

They put together some fun decor on the inside, but it's pretty small.  As I looked through the other reviews I saw pictures that looked completely different than what I saw...is there a back room or something?

The outside was a little messy.  A couple was outside dining when I picked up my food.  It was pretty much the first nice day of the spring, and maybe they just haven't cleaned up the front of the place...unless green plastic \"Little Tikes\" turtle sandboxes leaning against the side of the building are some sort of Thai decor about which I'm ignorant.  Cleaning up a bit when the warmer weather is more consistent will make this a decent outdoor dinner experience.  

BYOB.  

I'll be back for the curry and the convenience, and I'll add a star if the next thing I order is better than the first thing."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've had in years.  The woman working was more than a delight and was extremely busy.  So I was impressed.  The food is seriously top of the line. :) thanks!"}
{"text":"We went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance, delicious food with amazing flavors, and good service. We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Order from this place regularly.  Always good, always consistent, always amazing service."}
{"text":"Definitely good. Can't complain about my experience or the food. I feel bad that this restaurant is so tucked away in the middle of seemingly nothing. I was kind of worried when my friend suggested we try a thai place in Shaler area. There are so many better and closer reataurants (or so I thought). When I walked in, I was really impressed with the decor. I was not planning on eating very much, I was in the sun a lot earlier in the day, but I got really good vibes in there. It was calming, with huge windows and borderline quirky decor. Things like elephant statues, giant paintings of every fruit imaginable and an enormous Krishna covered the walls. There were also many, many plants. I liked it! I felt comfortable. I looked at the menu, and they had all my usual favorites. I love noodles, so I ordered the See Yew noodles with tofu. I was impressed. I am spoiled by Noodlehead, but this place was truly comparable. The portions were large and the prices were not terrible. I especially loved the pieces of egg in my dish, they were extra flavorful for some reason. Mus have really soaked up the brown sauce! The only thing I didn't completely love in the dish were the weird little pieces of carrot. I would return if I was ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Everything is extremely fresh and flavorful, and the staff is great. I have had 4 different appetizers and 6 entrees, and was thrilled with them all. If you like Thai food, then you will want to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewer, we were so pumped to see a new restaurant opening in Glenshaw. We've been saying for years that we were in need of some good, local choices. Then to find out it was going to be Thai...we were just super thrilled! The restaurant opened 2 weeks ago and we've already been there twice. The décor is really nice. I should say FAR better than the previous owners, and the service is OK. I'm sure once they work out the kinks, they'll be just fine. But the food is pretty darn great! We haven't disliked anything we've tried so far. Don't hesitate to try as much of the Curry dishes as possible. The green curry (or Keaw Wan) and the Pumpkin Curry were SUPER and we're looking forward to trying the Yellow Curry next. We also had the Kanom Jeen Nam Ngiao, which is a curry with pork, tomatoes and rice noodles, pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts and fresh lime, the Spring Rolls and the Pork Moo Yang appetizers, and finally, the Beef Pad Kra Prow, with green beans and peppers sauteed in a dark basil sauce, topped with a fried egg, served with jasmine rice. The flavors have so much depth and we're very excited to see how they are going to expand the menu offerings. Go try this place!!! Note: They currently only take cash, but there's an ATM, so you're safe!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant in the region. The food is amazing - especially their pineapple fried rice and Thai iced tea. But beyond that, the atmosphere itself is enough to keep you coming back: Repurposed interior with a rustic but elegant feel, and a bohemian style that is cool with mix-and-match chairs, tables, light fixtures, etc. I love their workers as well: One time, I was a few bucks short on cash for some take-out and had left my wallet at home...they gave me a discount and told me not to worry about it, and I've paid them back with loyal and much-repeated business."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is by far some of the best I can find throughout Pittsburgh. The Spring rolls however are good but prices for the amount of spring roll your actually getting.

The service is usually on point with a positive atmosphere around them then other places you would find on the south side."}
{"text":"My wife and I live 5 mins from this place. We like it a lot. I always get the Thai fried rice and my wife gets the pad thai. The best part is that they now accept card where for the longest time the only accepted cash. Their website wasn't renewed so I posted a picture of the menu."}
{"text":"I am a pizza and burger kind of girl, but I was brought here on a girl's night on, as my buddies have much more adventurous palates than I do. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my meal. The service was also wonderful! I will certainly not complain if we return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the North Hills.  Excellent Tom Kha Noodle Soup."}
{"text":"I was super excited for Le Thai Cafe to open(since I work next door). I tried the beef pad see ew for dinner last night, and ordered the spicy green beans with chicken for lunch today. The food is delicious! I will normally drive all over town to go to the various good Thai spots, but now I don't have to! They also have in house made French pastries that look amazing, can't wait to try those! I definitely recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Have been there a few times and have absolutely loved it.  It's BYOB, so you are able to have exactly the beer you want with your Thai food.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We moved within walking distance to this Café, June 2016  so thought why not try the food, The food was TERRIBLE, chicken was rubbery, cold, veggies hard, I had to ask our server to take back and reheat , The food is extremely pricey , We should have known better , you never see cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THAI PLACE IN PITTSBURGH. This was my first taste of Thai food, and I fell in love. So much so that I have gone to other Thai restaurants and get my typical Pad See Ew and am not happy with the dish elsewhere! Their spice scale is pretty consistent each time, I usually get a 7. Please give this place a try, I'm a local that will continue supporting this business for years to come!"}
{"text":"They started out not so bad when they opened. We assumed they would eventually take cards instead of only cash, but after all this time they STILL only take cash! You can't eat inside because they have no air conditioning and we used to get take out quite often from them, but then stopped because every single time the whole order would be very wrong. The food is way too over priced for my order to be completely wrong every single time. After many many times of this we just couldn't take it any more and stopped ordering. Their food is good when it is correct, but the whole execution of the business is done poorly."}
{"text":"Eh food was not that great. Not sure if I went on a off day but ordered Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, and Chicken Satay. The Chicken was okay, can't say the same about anything else. Place does not take credit cards...not that it's out of the ordinary for a place like this but still let's get with the ages. Ordered online, got dumplings instead of Chicken Satay so I had to wait while they fixed that."}
{"text":"Great find for thai food in Pittsburgh area.   We thought for sure we would not find a good thai place here after living in Hawaii for four years"}
{"text":"Place has such a unique decor, just loved it. Our service was excellent, very attentive and helpful. Food is probably some of the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh, very authentic. Next time I'm there, I'll order it a little spicier."}
{"text":"Update:  we kove(d) is place but the last two visits have been less than expected. In April we had spring rolls that were still frozen inside ( but they replaced and gave us free dessert so we figured an off night, that happens). A month later we went for dinner ( memorial weekend Sunday). Food was much spicier than usual no almost inedible.  I have always ordered an 8 and loved the complex flavor so.    We will try again and hope it was an off month or two."}
{"text":"The pad thai was fantastic and really reasonably priced. I will definitely be getting takeout from here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best green & red curry dishes I've ever had. I now can't enjoy curry at other Thai restaurants because it simply doesn't compare. My boyfriend & I have to control ourselves in order to not be getting takeout from this place every night. So instead we basically indulge once a week. Keep up the good curry work bc if this place ever ceases to exist a part of me will die."}
{"text":"I've been twice and have been impressed both times. Pumpkin Curry was about the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Laab were all solid as well. The French pastry dessert I had was fab with an over-the-top presentation.  

This place is a gem in an otherwise culinary desert."}
{"text":"NOTE: they now accept credit cards. It is no longer a cash only place. A lot of reviews say it's cash only which almost detoured me.

The food was good. I do not eat Thai food often. The yellow curry was pretty good. 1-10 spice level like normal. I do not see why people rave about the spring rolls. Very average but not bad. The pad Thai has a sweet flavor that I enjoyed but I could see some people who would not like it. Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Great food! Best Thai I've ever had! Been there multiple times and I've never been disappointed. I recommend getting vegetables instead of paying extra to add meat, they don't put a lot of meat in for the extra cost. But overall, love this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken noodle dish I had was good!  The service was also good, they were very friendly.  I love the new decor in the restaurant ,I love how they uncovered all the windows to let the light in, the previous place had them covered with curtains.  It is BYOB  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Close to home, reasonable, great food, and now they even deliver. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"YUM some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Bonus of BYOB! Staff was friendly and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"As I eat my left over Ginger Chicken (no mushrooms/extra carrots, spice level 4) I am reminded that Le Thai Cafe has THE BEST THAI FOOD in the Pittsburgh area. Totally worth the drive into the suburbs. We normally do take out, but if you want to sit and eat, it's a very quaint restaurant with great service too. The Crab Rangoon is top notch as well!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Location is right on Mount Royal Blvd but it feels quiet and neighborhoody. The server was very nice and the portions were large. They have outdoor seating and it's BYOB. The dishes are spicy so be careful what spicy level you order! I like spicy and ordered a 5 for my Panang Curry and it had some heat! Note that Panang Curry is not on the menu but it's my favorite Thai dish so I asked the waitress and she immediately obliged and said they could make it."}
{"text":"Decided to meet my boyfriend here for dinner after work on a Monday at 6:30. There were only two other occupied tables which was probably a red flag. There was no air conditioning and it was stuffy and very uncomfortable. Our server brought us water right away and that's where the decent service ended. We ordered our meals but our server did not write down anything. I ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai with a spice level of 1 and my boyfriend ordered a broccoli and shrimp thing with a spice level of 7. (I was planning to order soup but it was so damn warm in the restaurant that soup seemed like a ridiculous idea.) When the food arrived, my boyfriend's order was completely wrong. He was given chicken with ZERO spice. I mean, it was bland. Because the server hadn't written down our orders, she obviously couldn't reference anything when my boyfriend told her that his order was wrong. The chicken was weirdly flattened and VERY dry, to the point of being inedible. The handful of shrimp on my pad thai was rubbery and overly fishy tasting. My pad thai was weird and sticky. No cilantro. No lime. The server did not charge us for my boyfriend's meal, which we appreciated. Even though this place is literally five minutes from my house, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and both times were unremarkable. It doesn't seem to matter if it's summer or not, they never have mango sticky rice. Although I'm sure they could drive down the hill to Giant Eagle and pick up some mangos. 

This time we ordered the Pad See Ew with pork. The noodles were mushy and overcooked, the pork was tough and dry, it was devoid of vegetables, and the flavor was so lackluster that I had to doctor it up with Sriracha. 

We ordered spring rolls, too. Incredibly bland. Don't bother. 

This is likely the most expensive Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. We spent $30 on two entrees and spring rolls. Portions were just too small to justify the prices."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Thai restaurant.  The Curries are delicious, lemongrass soup was delightful and along with all the dishes you can order spice level on a scale of 1-10, making every entree accessible to people sensitive to spice and people who prefer more spice.  The appetizers are all excellent and when we brought it to our server's attention that the spring rolls were cold inside, they went above and beyond to fix it.  First they brought hot spring rolls, then a complimentary order of dumplings as well as Thai iced tea.  We would've been happy with just hot spring rolls but they truly were apologetic and more than redeemed themselves for serving spring rolls that had cool pockets inside.  The pad Thai noodles were PERFECT, Which I have not really ever experienced so I highly recommend anyone finding themselves in The vicinity of this restaurant to give it a try."}
{"text":"Super cute place. We've only gotten take out but it has always been delicious. A little pricey but the food is good and decent portions. Only downside is they don't take cards so bring cash!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, super cool vibe inside and outside. Tons of seating and very comfy . Started off with spring rolls which were very crispy and tasty. Then tried the Penang curry with chicken and the pad Thai. The curry and rice were very tasty and balanced with the right heat at a level of 6. The pad Thai was even better with the perfect noodle and chicken ratio. Would definitely eat both dishes again. The standout of the meal was the home made coconut ice cream . It blew us away. I would make the trip just to get that again. Fried bananas were just bananas in the spring roll wrapper and fried. Not my favorite choice as a desert but it was ok."}
