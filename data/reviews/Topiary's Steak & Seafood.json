{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.
We had prime rib sandwich and it was delicious, done to perfection.
You can tell that it is a premium quality beef.
Will be back again to sample more of the new menu items.
Absolute must for steak lovers."}
{"text":"I was that Topiary's on Saturday night and it was just a wonderful experience it's truly a five-star restaurant the food was excellent the staff were friendly and excellent and I don't know what more to say this is the most wonderful restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. The waiters were rude and dismissive, and every dish we ordered was incorrect (i.e. I ordered a steak medium and it came to the table blue rare). The \"tableside\" caesar salad was pre-mixed in the kitchen using a bottled dressing from the grocery store, and it was smaller than the side salad served with the steak. 

Before we could ask to see a dessert menu, the waiter asked us to leave the table and go to the bar so that they could use the table to serve another couple. He apologized for the inconvenience and said that dessert would be on the house. We were seated at a table in the bar and waited 45 minutes without service, at which point we asked for the bill and left. 

IMHO, this is the WORST steakhouse in the GTA. You're far better off going to The Keg. Needless to say, we will not be returning..."}
{"text":"Topiary's is probably Malton's best-kept restaurant secret!

My husband and I have dined at Topiary's twice so far and it is truly amazing! From the outside you would never guess that once you step inside it's as if you've entered a French chateaux! This is definitely a place to come to for a special occasion like an anniversary or birthday.

The food is simply INCREDIBLE and the steak is so tender, it's as if you're cutting through butter! On our first visit, we had the filet-neptune which was TO DIE FOR and the second time we had the bacon-wrapped filet (less the neptune) ($42). I can't say enough about the food here and it's probably the best steak I've ever eaten! This restaurant is a MUST TRY for anyone that enjoys a top-quality steak, first class service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Attended for a business lunch pasta with grilled chicken was delicious
Service as always very attentive and friendly
Fellow diner had a greek salad and fresh oysters and he enjoyed his meal."}
{"text":"Celebrated our wedding anniversary at Topiary on July 6th. rather than a high end establishment usually visited.  Found the prices about the same but that is where the matching stopped.
Food - absolutely perfect 
Service - excellent, polished and professional waitstaff 
Atmosphere  - exactly what was promised (nice quiet table) great ambiance 

My wife mentioned her dessert was not as good as expected and they not only offered another dessert but removed the cost from the bill

Bottom line, LaCastile has lost a customer, Topiary has won our loyalty and we will return."}
{"text":"We've dined here twice for two special anniversary occasions.  You'd never know it from the exterior but it's literally a misplaced gem on Derry Road!  Lovely ambiance and decor inside, like dining in a French castle, very fitting for fancy and romantic occasions when you want to impress your company.  Service has always been very professional and attentive.  We've never been here on a 'busy' day so that may not be saying much although it does not take away from then.  Always delectable entrees.  You sure pay for what you get but have never left unhappy.  Recommended for special occasions!"}
{"text":"We got gift certificates for this restaurant last Christmas and forgot about them.. when I went to the website I learned that they were under new management.  Fortunately they had it right on the website that they would honor the previous managements gift certificates, which is nice. It's a huge restaurant, and it is very ornate.  Typical old school steak house in the same vein as La Castile. Lots of wood, stained glass and floral wallpaper. The waiters are in tuxes, and are very good at their jobs, service is excellent. My husband and I both opted for the filet mignon.  It started with greens in a vinaigrette.  My husband asked if he could get a caesar salad instead.  Most places will allow it, with an upcharge. No, he was told.. he would have to order the appetizer salad ($10). I got my greens.. mediocre. Nothing special. Decent basalmic vinaigrette. He got the caesar salad. It was ok. Maybe slightly better than most. Our steaks came, mine with garlic mashed potatoes and his with french fries. Being a steak house, the potatoes come in a seperate bowl. A small amount of possibly the worst fries we have ever tasted in a bowl.  The garlic mashed were bland - barely tasted any garlic, I stole the butter from the bread basket that was put on our table on arrival to try and liven them up a bit, added way more salt than I am usually comfortable with. The side  vegetables (carrots, an asparagus spear and bok choy) were not al dente, but full on crunchy.  The steak, while cooked perfectly was a bit on the bland side, and would have been better with a bit of bernaise on the side.  We opted out of dessert.  Overall, it is a pricey restaurant that has mediocre food for the price.  If you are a seafood lover, maybe you would enjoy it more than we did, the shrimps we saw on one ladies plate as we passed by looked enormous.  It's a very old crowd in there, which explains the bland menu. Might be nice for a family occasion, but I can think of many other places that are a lot more delicious and fun."}
{"text":"It is what it is. The place is extremely ornate and on the verge of kitsch. Yes, the service was very good and the food was good. All-in-all for that are, it's a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my cousin & wife for a mid-evening dinner. I use to be a regular at this Resto but decided to expand where I would have dinner. This is a old fashion sit down white table cloth dining location. The location itself is straight out of the mid 19th century with intricately carved wood paneling, high ceilings & classic architecture a great restaurant. Although it's loss a step the food was still solid. I had a 6oz Fillet with side baked & veggies. Pretty decent dinner. I also had for an apie the shrimp cocktail. They were a big as a babies arm & delicious!! I'd go again."}
{"text":"We took grandma out as part of her Christmas gift. We enjoyed ourselves. Two of us had steak andthe third person full rack of  ribs. The food was excellent and the service was even better."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've dined here, but it was memorable enough to write about.  I know that had some kind of amazing steak (probably Neptune), but the service sticks out in my mind the most.  Impeccable waiter service would never let my drink get below the ice and I never worried about an empty, dirty plate sitting in front of me either (both pet peeves of mine, especially when paying these prices).  We dined for a couple of hours and the entire experience was great.  If you can lay down the \"dough\", give them a shot next time you are in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"I attended a business lunch here recently.  It was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. The decor is classic and comfortable. The food was very good and the service was attentive and friendly. Will certainly come back here for personal dining occassions in the future.
Great dessert menu too!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me as a great place in the Malton area.  I tried the Breaded Calamari served with their taziki dipping sauce and lemon wedge.  It was very good... fresh and portion was fair.

Also, their service was good.  I went online but they are updating their website.  Offered to email their menu to me.  I got it right away.

I would try this place again!"}
{"text":"Very fancy place that my family has been coming to for years.  The owner is a nice guy who comes over to our table to chat with us (we've known him from his previous restaurant).  The type of place you'd go for an anniversary or birthday dinner, we've never had a bad experience here. Very nice atmosphere on the inside that reminds me of a decorated castle of some sort, complete with the large doors and ridiculously high ceilings to match.

Their steaks and seafood are their speciality (as the name suggests).  The waitstaff are extremely good at their job (water glass never got empty, they sneakily removed all empty dishes, etc), so if they're forgetful or rude you can probably bet it was on purpose. 

My personal favourite is their ribs, which can get a bit messy but they bring you a small water-dish to wash your fingers.  Lobster and filet mignon is also a family favourite."}
{"text":"Today my son took me to Topiary's for Father's Day lunch. This is not the first time we were here but every time we go I feel compelled to write a review somewhere. This place is just plain awesome. Attention to detail in every facet of the meal; the food, the ambiance and the service ALL top notch. Today we had Shrimp Cocktail, Caesar Salad and Filet Mignon. Perfect is about all I can say. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. It is not a cheap place but what you get is worth every penny. We will be going here again."}
