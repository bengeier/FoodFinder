{"text":"We discovered City Bistro when looking for a central location for a business lunch. This location was perfect for an informal meeting with clients. It has several areas that are perfect for us to sit and catch up with with our clients, and made it easy to go through a quick presentation on our laptops. Food was fantastic, with a menu that had a different spin on some lunch favorites. We will be back! This will be our go-to Central location for meetings! Great service, and management was very on-top of how we were doing. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best food I've had since moving to Arizona! The service was great! The staff the super friendly and the owners were so nice! The fries  and sandwiches  are so good I can't pick a favorite . I have loved everyone I have chose!"}
{"text":"First time to City Bistro for lunch and the service was fantastic. Ordered a little after lunch and enjoyed that they had an area to relax and catch up with some emails during my lunch hour, the special sauce with the fries was so tasty!! Even as a new restaurant in the complex, they cater to the lunch crowd and handled issues exceptionally. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss.  I've had good burgers and bad burgers.  Good sandwiches and bad sandwiches.  Even had bad fries( soggy and undercooked).  Today had the southwest salad with chicken.  Salad was good.  Dressing was good.  Chicken wan cold and rubbery and was thrown in the trash, waste of $3.  They also forgot to put the avocado on the salad.  Not sure I will be back.  Can go across the street to Lenny's for a better burger and fries.  Can go to Panara for a salad or sandwich."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in. Heard about this place from some fellow co-workers and decided to walk over and give it a try for lunch. First impression: clean, open and spacious. Nice furniture, open kitchen, and even an area to chill... they have reading materials for your pleasure! Menu was easy to read but it was a little pricey, though. They have options to dine in, order to go and delivery. No online ordering yet... hoping they get this set up cause I find it to be really convenient.  I'd come back cause the staff was friendly and the food was good. They were prompt which is good especially since it was lunchtime! They're open for breakfast (need to try!) and close at 4pm. I would have never known they existed cause their location is pretty hidden (unless you work in that building) so I'm glad I stepped out to try this new place!"}
{"text":"Only getting 1 star because zero or negative is not an option.  Two times (yes I gave them a second chance) I ordered a chopped salad with grilled chicken, and both times the supposedly \"pre-cooked\" grilled chicken on my salad was best case severely undercooked, realistically raw.  I even asked them to cook the chicken extra well done the second time.  When I returned my salad, all I got was an argument and was more or less accused of not knowing the difference between cooked and uncooked chicken and/or lying to them.  Ultimately my money was refunded, but not without a fight.  Don't bother eating here.  There are better places with better service, better food and lower prices in the area that know how to fully cook chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and home made chips. Ridiculous good. Cold or pannini style. Staff are awesome and accommodating. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place! I was really impressed with City Bistro..  I found a great menu with affordable prices. Talking to folks in line they all had a favorite and all were something different. My lunch (buffalo chicken sandwich - chips made in house and a drink) hit - the - spot! Well done!  The layout and open atmosphere makes it really comfortable.. Too many places these days are so cramped.. Great outside patio in addition.  This place obviously focus is good food and good service! I was on a time crunch and was in and out in great time and satisfied as can be!  I recommend this place for all! My next visit gotta try some SOUP! :).  A job well done.."}
{"text":"City Bistro Rocks! Food and service were excellent! Great place to meet and have a quick bite, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"When the City Bistro was moving into our building I was very excited. The look and design of the place created such anticipation for delicious bistro-style food. As I am a foodie and love to cook, I couldn't wait. I'm only writing this in hopes of serious change. I really want this place to succeed.  This is meant to be helpful.  PRICE - The prices are TOO HIGH. In some cases, more expensive than listed on their website (Why? I have no idea). If the food was better i would almost see spending the extra money. But, quite frankly, the food isn't all that good.  FOOD -  It's almost there, but I think the people in the back cooking need to take a little more pride in their work. I've ordered a few things so far and other than the sweet potato fries, which I love (How can you screw up deep fried potatoes right?), the other items just missed the mark.   EXAMPLE #1 - This morning I looked on their menu (online) and thought the 'Farmers Scramble' looked pretty good. $6.99...not too bad. So, I went to the Bistro and...well...no 'Farmers Scramble'. But the person taking my order (I think was the manager), told me that here, it's called the 'Breakfast Bowl'...OK, cool, $1 more in cost? Why? So, it's not bad. It's OK. The scrambled eggs were WAY over cooked (Totally brown on the bottom) and the toast wasn't toast as much as warm bread. Good bread, but not toast. The rest tasted pretty good. Nice veg, great hash browns (again...hard to screw up a potato).  Close, but just missed it for the price.  EXAMPLE #2 - Ordered the AZ Chicken sandwich. Not bad. It was ok. Although for some weird reason, there was a small chip of bone on the side of my boneless chicken. A little off-putting, but the chicken was tender and delicious. $7.99 for just a sandwich seems a bit pricey. Especially with the bone chip. On the upside, if you order a side (I got the sweet tater fries) you get a free drink. Total cost for the lunch: $11.94.   $11.94 for a sandwich, fries and a drink...not bad. I just could have done without the bone chip.  Word travels fast in a building like this. I've heard some pretty bad reviews.  STAFF - This poor staff looks SO under trained in customer service. They are so nice, very friendly, but so under trained. I want to jump over the counter and show them so bad.   TIP #1 - 'Good morning and welcome to City Bistro. What can we get for you today?'  TIP #2 - 'Would you like to add a side to your order? It comes with a free refillable drink.  THE SMELL - There is absolutely no ventilation in the lobby where the Bistro is housed. The whole lobby smells like a grease pit.  Please, please, please City Bistro...up your game. I have a feeling we will be working side-by-side for a while.  I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Daily specials can be a bit hit or miss, thier burger is outclassed by surrounding places. Overall just not worth the expense when there is so much above average food within walking distance. Fries are over seasoned and chips are homemade, but the quality is spotty."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. I absolutely love the Mexican street corn and their chicken and waffles are delicious! Highly recommend this place and the staff is ALWAYS smiling :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS,  GREAT PRICES AND FRIENDLY STAFF ! I've eaten here a few times and I've loved every thing I've tried so far . Nice open layout so even during the lunch rush you don't feel crowded. Definitely recommending this to my friends and co-workers."}
{"text":"The food is dry as heelll i went to go eat out side there damn employees were smoking weed outside while i was trying to eat they didn't even care i should of call the police but i just fucking threw my dru food away and left worst customer service  and they boss dont even care"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is out of this world!!! My favorite is the Mac and cheese and the flat breads! And the service is great!"}
{"text":"Convenient if in or near the Phoenix Plaza Towers.  Food is great but a touch pricy.  I highly recommend the Cubano or the grilled cheese.  The seasoned fries are tasty even without ketchup.  Would be 5* if combos came in under $10."}
{"text":"Great spot quick/fast, tasty food, and decent price. You can park in the parking garage but it is credit card only to pay and City Bistro and it's not a system for validation."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, home-made chips = yum and burgers = double yummy. Outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great, friendly service, best Mexican street corn ever! Reasonable pricing. They got amazing food here"}
{"text":"Uh, YUM!  Been going there for a few months now and everything I have had is amazing.  Staff is friendly and courteous, which is 1/2 the battle in any restaurant.  The Mushroom & Brie burger is a MUST HAVE!  Then, when you've eaten one of those every day for a week, switch to the Kale and Quinoa Salad with dried cranberries, blueberries, shaved almonds and honey lime dressing - Double YUM!  Flatbreads are off the charts delicious with an ample amount of toppings.  Nothing to write but good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Service was great.  Food was marvelous.  Our party of four all had different menu items and we all raved.  The only negative is that it is hard to find.  It is in the office tower next to the Hilton."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on this review for a while now. I have tried City Bistro twice due to its location. People are great, interior is nice, however both times I have been in the food has been less than stellar. During my first visit I tried the buffalo chicken wrap. As another reviewer mentioned, I don't know what I was given, but it definitely was not a grilled chicken breast. It tasted like lukewarm rubber and was complete with artificial grill marks. Today I tried their southwest salad. Nothing about the salad worked. It was 90% cabbage with 3 avocado slices, a few beans, and a couple of corn kernels all for the lovely price of $7.00. I get it, eating in downtown Phoenix is expensive, but I honestly can't believe I just paid $7 for a salad with zero protein and a terrible flavor. After 3 bites of the salad I was done. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you go here it's more than likely because you work in a surrounding office and you forgot to pack your own lunch or are too lazy to walk to Ocotillo and put something descent/healthy/un-processed in your body...  I have tried the bistro 7x... Each time disappointed in the quality, taste and price for nothing more than edible garbage.   Avoid entrees with the rubbery chicken at all costs. The chicken comes with grill marks without ever touching a grill. Magic?! NO... Just google 'fake char marks' for the full story behind that fast food trick.No local produce, dairy, meats or grains. The soups are loaded with salt and the salads are too pricey for the leafy brown let down that has been sitting in the walk-in fridge a good week past its sell by date.   Will the food kill you, no. Will you feel sick and bloated processing all the fillers and a artificial additives, probably.    Try the place, just don't go in with high hopes..."}
{"text":"i love city bistro, and am so happy they moved into the building.  my new go-to for lunch.  the street corn is amazing.  the mac and cheese, spicy cuban sandwich, and burgers are amazing.  breakfast is good too - the quesadilla and eggs benedict."}
{"text":"I only want to talk about the Phoenix Philly, it is in a class by itself.  Everyone of my co-worker that I suggested it to, loves it.  I am sure there are other good things on the menu, but today is just about the Phoenix Philly.  If you work in the area, you have to give it a taste, if you don't enjoy, hunt me down, and give me a hard time about it.  I am in IT, i can take it - lol.  Hope you enjoy.  4 Thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a bite at. Killer food, great service and a great atmosphere. If I worked downtown I'd be here everyday."}
{"text":"I work in one of the local towers and find it very convenient to call-in my order then just pick it up a few minutes later.  Food isn't inexpensive, but the quality is worth the extra $1-2 dollars.  I've tried several items from their menu.  I especially like the Bistro Burger, Cuban sandwich and Philly.    There are many other options nearby (i.e. Cranberries, Panara, Subway, Lenny's) but for me, this is much faster and I don't have to sacrifice on quality.  Also, I don't have to cross the street and deal with a long traffic light, long restaurant lines or homeless people."}
{"text":"Food is okay. They must be smoking crack if they think $8.65 ($7.99 + tax) is an acceptable price for a grilled cheese sandwich though. And no, there was no drink or side with that. About 3 months ago I had a burger (patty only, with slices of onion and tomato and lettuce) and a side of sweet potato fries and it came to something like $13. Prices are best described as insulting.  I work in the tower next door and although it's convenient, most of us skip this place because of the prices. I was reminded of that today as my Visa was charged $8.65 for a basic grilled cheese sandwich. Next time I'll walk across the street.  Also - adding to what a previous poster said, the 5* reviews dated 11/12 are bogus, one of them looks like the cashier who rung me up today. Each poster has only written a single review and it just happens to be a glowing, if vague (delicious! open layout!), review of this place which is basically impossible to find unless you work in one of the towers at Phoenix Plaza."}
{"text":"I have not been in for a few days . I came back today due to I was so happy to know that Tuna Melt was not on the menu. This is one of my most fav sandwiches. I was so surprised today how soo tasty it was . I made it a combo with fruit . It was a PERFECT lunch . The staff are amazing and the owner is so wonderful , you really feel welcome here. The food prices are very good and the food is just as wonderful."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. But lately the food seems gross. And do the employees ever change gloves? I see them walking around with gloves on touching random stuff like phones and headphones. The staff is nice, but it seems like everyone is just going through the motions to kick out the mediocre food."}
