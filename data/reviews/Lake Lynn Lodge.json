{"text":"It has been some time since I have eaten at Lake Lynn, but I have nothing but best remarks concerning their steaks, good quality of beef, taste excellent! Portion sizes are very adequate! My daughter and I have in the past shared many memorable experiences there, it was our favorite Friday night outing when she was in high school! We still talk about those days and plan to visit the restaurant again soon.No the service is not that friendly but they are mostly young kids making below minimum wage so tip them well! And have the courage to speak up if you do not like something. Yes this is more of a locals hang out, but give it a chance! It is one of Cabarrus Counties hidden secrets to a great dinning experience if you love steak! So all you people that pretend to be high class ,go to uptown Charlotte for your 4 star dinning.And keep your comments to yourself, Thank you !
Keep up the good work Lake Lynn, we love you guys!

P.S. And if you show yourself polite when you enter the door you will get a polite response!"}
{"text":"My review is not based on \"today\". I haven't been there in a long time but when I was there last, it was just \"OK\". That's why it gets three stars. if it was 1967, it would be five stars all the way. What you need to know is that LLL has been around for 60 years. It epitomized the super club.

When I was a kid it was THE place to go on Friday and Saturday night. People drove just to go to this place in the middle of no where. It was brown bagging only in a dry county. Everyone's dad had a portable bar case in the trunk. They would bring trays of mixers and veggies etc. to the tables and you made your own cocktails. There was always some blue haired old lady playing a Wurlitzer organ in the main dining room and us kids would stand around beside her and watch her play or go down to the lake and skip stones. Summer time meant for a long night for us kids when we went to LLL.

 It is a throwback to an earlier time where easy, gracious, Southern living ruled. Most of us that went to LLL on Friday nights were eating Sunday lunch at the country club. It's just the way it was. 

Today LLL hangs on. People want it to be great like it used to be and the old folk that remember it when, don't know the difference. They're at least in their 80s. The original folks that started it are done. The people running it now are just running a restaurant. But for those of us that grew up in it's hay day, just seeing the old sign brings back memories."}
{"text":"Rustic and camp-like, down to that camp-lodge smell.
The last time I went they had a cigarette machine in the lobby and the bar was full of people smoking despite local smoking laws.
I wouldn't call it a clean restaurant.
That said, we've been there a few times.  The steaks are always tasty.  The potatoes come out just right.  The nachos were homemade and a real treat.
Service is slow and generally awful.
Do not use the bathrooms here unless you absolutely cannot wait.   There are no doors - just shower curtains.  
I wish someone would buy it, rennovate it and generally fix it.  The location is quaint and there is a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here on a Friday night a few weeks ago.  Upon entering we were welcomed with an overwhelming mildew smell, but we did have a restaurant coupon to use.  Started with room temperature and spongey shrimp cocktail.  We both ate one shrimp (more about that later).  The salads contained wilted lettuce and the dressings were obviously for a bottle and possibly a cheap brand.  We hid the remaining 4 shrimp under the remains of the uneaten salads.  

Wife had stuffed flounder that she said was okay.  I had the strip steak, which was also okay.  Restaurants can't always help the amount of fat in the steaks.  The tea was cloudy and tasted a little \"soured.\"  When we left, we had to wait about five minutes at the register for someone to come and take our money.  Wife and I both knew that would be our first and last visit to this restaurant. The only thing outstanding about the meals were the baked potatoes which were delicious.

After the fact I found out the local health department report showed the restaurant has an \"unapproved well.\"  Maybe that explains the cloudy and off-taste of the tea."}
{"text":"So often a dining experience can be detracted from by unpleasant or inattentive wait staff. Definitely not the case at Lake Lynn. Christina was our server and she brought a charming sense of humor as well as food to our table. We did experience a problem with our order, but I believe the mark of a good restaurant is not whether problems occur, but rather how the management responds. While we waited for the correction, we took the opportunity to enjoy a short walk down by the lake; relaxing, sipping a glass of wine. The salad was fresh, crisp and I was happy to discover the blue cheese dressing homemade. The porterhouse steak was huge and well seasoned. Dessert was complimentary from the manager and although I was too full to eat it, it looked good. Word of advice, the large room immediately to the left stays cooler than the regular dining area closer to the kitchen. Better view of the lake too! Hope you enjoy your experience as much as I did."}
{"text":"Dinner was average to disappointing.  The salads were simple and dressings were tasty.  It took a long time for our food to come out which is odd because there were only three tables with customers. My seafood platter was mostly frozen not fresh. The fish was thin. The oysters were tiny.  My husbands porterhouse was huge, tender in some spots and gristle in others. My sons onion rings were very good!  We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I should have turned around immediately when I realized that on a Saturday night at 6:30 there were only 4 other cars in the parking lot. But we were meeting other family members there so I went on in. And then the odor hit me. At that point I should have ran. Wish I had. It was extremely hot and uncomfortable in the main dining room and although it was a warm day it was obvious the air conditioning was as outdated as the dusty, gaudy decor. Our waitress was kind but clearly out of her league. She had one other table besides ours and still had to be asked several times for things. Pretty important things too, like drinks and even my nephews entree! The steaks were decent quality but not cooked to the temperature like most of us had ordered. The sweet tea was simply awful.  I assume in the 50's this was probably a decent place to eat. But 65 years and the lack of many sorely needed improvements means I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Despite some of the less than stellar reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Lake Lynn Lodge. We were glad we did.
1. The musty smell inside the entrance is bothersome but not overwhelming. Unsure why the owners don't put out something to absorb the smell.The smell doesn't extend into the restaurant and we forgot about it as soon as we were inside.
2. The interior is rustic/vintage. There is no paneling but actual wood. With lots of wood-burning fireplaces, wood tables and comfortable chairs. It's quaint, appropriate for the setting and allows for open views to the lake. Trying to find the bar was difficult - a bit of a maze to get to the back. 
3. The food was excellent. We both ordered streaks - one medium-well and one medium rare - and they were both done excellently. Also had appetizers. The homemade Italian dressing was especially good. Did not try anything with water - per earlier reviews.
4. Service - our waitress was good. She was attentive and friendly. Everyone in the restaurant appeared to be enjoying their dinners.
Overall we had a good meal and will go back."}
{"text":"Now we're talking old school.  As in 1951 - the year that the lodge was founded.  At least, that's what the sign says (as I wasn't there).  It doesn't look like the place has changed in the intervening years.  Walls are still paneled, and there is a decent amount of grit built up.  Not dirt so much, just dank and grime.

That and it's not exactly hi-brow dining.  Almost like a summer camp really.  They say that they have musical entertainment on the weekends in the large dining room, but I have a tough time seeing it, since all the tables have chairs on them.  That and on a Thursday there are a total of two tables occupied (we are one).  But who knows?

Lots of menus on the table - most of the food is steak and \"seafood\".  I don't know if it comes from the lake, but I probably wouldn't eat it.  The grilled shrimp was actually quite good.  The sirloin special also was pretty tasty.  The hot wing appetizer?  Decent, but I think next time I may go the non-breaded (\"naked\") route.  Beware of the hot sauce though, it's a little spicy.  Salads are served with a good amount of dressing.

Pictures to come when everything is up and running.

Sweet Tea Report: The first thing that strikes me is the amazing amount of cloudiness.  I thought at first it was the glasses, which may be there from the opening of the lodge.  But it's actually from the liquid.  And it wasn't just one glass.  Every glass, every refill was very cloudy.  Maybe it was lake water.  It doesn't seem to affect the taste, but it's not terribly sweet.  Not a strong taste of tea either.  Definitely average, and more than a little strange.  Other (soft) drinks come in a can.  Might be a better choice here."}
{"text":"I can only review this place as a bar, and only from the position of an outsider, but that being said - there are few places I'd rather be if for some reason I ever again found myself looking for a drink with the locals somewhere in the sticks east of Concord, NC.  Accurately described elsewhere as having a kind of summer camp vibe, the place is a pretty amazing, almost labyrinthine lodge full of good folk, cheap beer, and solid bar food.  I can vouch for the fact that a city boy can be quite welcome so long as you're there for the right reasons and just want to have a good time.

But PRO TIP: Only order the bartender's \"special\" lemon drops if you've checked your inner germaphobe at the door.  She seems to have an *unorthodox* method for rimming the glasses. ;)"}
{"text":"We had a coupon to use and after reading the reviews,  we were very apprehensive about how our experience would be.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  We had steaks that were prepared properly the first time which is a surprise for me as I prefer mine medium well.  When I eat at Mortons or Flemings,  it takes them two or three times to get it right.
The service was friendly and our app, salad & entrée arrived at proper intervals.  The real wood interior gives a great lodge feel.
The only negatives were the slight musty smell in the foyer and that it took about five minutes for the hostess to come to the register to take our money as a few other employees who weren't doing anything told us she would come out of the back soon."}
{"text":"Certain social obligations cannot be avoided. One such event for me was held at Lake Lynn Lodge. 

I recalled rumors from the past that gave me cause for avoidance. I read the reviews here. I read reviews other places.  I developed some concerns. 

What does a person with concerns about a restaurant do to alleve  their fears?  Well, I have no idea... because what *I* did was consult the Cabarrus Health Alliance Restaurant Inspection Report. 

You can do the same here: http://cabarrus.nc.gegov.com/reports.cfm

I've worked in restaurants... I know what food attracts. I realize every place can have an off day where they got caught without something at the right temp. But there are some pretty bizarre violations that if you look back, are constantly repeated. 

The most concerning to me was that the water source is an unapproved well. Really, who cares that fish are thawing in the hand washing sink if the hands are being washed in \"unapproved\" well water?

So the event arrived and we were told to wait in line to place our order (it was a party so there were preselected menu items). Steak cooked to a crisp and a baked potato... hopefully no water involved here. 

We entered the party area and there were cheese cubes and a veggie tray. I asked our ball-capped and tube socked host/bartender where I might place my handbag and wrap and he said, \"Over there\" and pointed at the corner of the room. So I put them on the floor as directed. 

I've seen several comments about the cloudy tea. As it was a large group, there was a glass urn of tea for self service. There were particles floating in that urn so large, I think they could have worn water wings. It really made me wonder what can be found in unapproved well water. 

We were seated for dinner. I passed on the salad because of the water thing and some other sketchy salad bowl problem and instead opted to down about 32 pre-wrapped packages of Lance Cap-n Wafers. 

My plate arrived and I will say that my steak, while very fatty, was actually quite tasty. My baked potato was also good. 

Upon completion of dinner, I excused myself and went to the ladies room. I opened the door from the hallway, entered, and laughed out loud when I saw that there was no stall door... but rather an old, ugly shower curtain in front of the stall. It really seemed fitting."}
{"text":"Very good steaks! Good service! We gave them the benefit of a doubt and we were surprised !"}
