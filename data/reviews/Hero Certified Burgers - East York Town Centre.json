{"text":"Well I must have been right about this crappy place because as of the spring of 2016 it is now closed.  I guess you just can't overcharge people for horrible, uncooked food and expect them to recommend it or keep coming back.  I hope the owners and staff take this failure as a chance to learn from their mistakes and make sure that any future venture is done with quality and customer service in mind."}
{"text":"Best burger I had in a while! Great staff as well. They take their time with your order which shows in the taste which is worth it. This is a new location located at East York Town Centre right next to pizza pizza. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain drinks with so many options. I was overwhelmed. I tried the Coke Zero Lime & then refilled for a Fanta Zero Peach which both tasted great. I ordered hero burger with sweet potato fries combo and ancho chipotle sauce on side which came to ~ 13$. The order took 10 mins and staff brought my food to my table. Burger was juicy and tasted delicious. The chipotle sauce for the fries was an awesome addition which I highly recommend. The only minor negative is their sweet potato fries tasted OK nothing special. Overall i had a great tasting burger and a memorable fountain drink.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Greatest hamburger you can get in the GTA, the toppings are little bit expensive but the add a lot of flavor. The drink machine have a lot off choices. The only bad thing is that u need to wait like 15 min which is a lot for fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The whopping three reviews of this place are all over the map...I'll give my assessment based on my recent visit (and as an out-of-towner).    I was visiting a nearby establishment and so happened to find my way into East York Centre...which was quite interesting and had a vastly diverse crowd.  Hero is located just outside the main mall, you have to go outside and was a pleasant find.  You walk in and I immediately noticed the Coke Freestyle unit, you can get one of dozens Coke products!    It kind of reminded me of Chipotle mixed with Five Guys...hormone free, Halal certified burgers, with free rein on what you want on your burger.  If you're one of those that take FOREVER to make up your mind, do your homework before going in...I managed to figure out they had a a couple \"pre-made\" options, which kept scrolling by on the LCD menus (annoying!).    I got myself the Signature Combo, which include fries and bottomless soda (thanks to the Freestyle machine!).  From what I could gather (when my burger arrived), Signature meant cheddar cheese, Hero sauce, onion and tomatoes (appeared legit).  What i thought was creative is the wrapping, unique in a way that allows you to eat your sammich without getting it all over yourself...love it!    Now...the burger was good, but nothing I thought was ultra unique.  The cooking was spot on, flavors were good (again, nothing cray cray) and served quickly with friendly service.    If you need a burger, don't want to spend a ton of change...hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Gotta agree with Dave on this one.  I decided to give this place a try against my better judgement having tried their burgers at another location a few years earlier.  Definitely was unimpressed. I got the Blue cheese burger. It took about 3 bites into what seemed like a spongy frozen patty before i could actually taste the cheese. Overall it was just about the blandest thing i ever tasted. Luckily i ordered the onion rings. Gotta give them credit for that and probably why i gave them 2 stars they were well cooked and crunchy.  The best part...for this tasteless burger and rings = $16.35 for that price i expect fresh fluffy burger meat not frozen  Guess it will be my last try at this overpriced burger chain. Still can't figure out how they popped up all over the place and manage to survive. Guess it won't be on my wallet!"}
