{"text":"2013 08 21 We decided not to have tea at Fung Lam Court 722 Kennedy Road this morning. Instead we had a glass of water each. We were charged $1.20 for each glass of Markham tap water+HST for a total of $2.71. We won't be going back to Fung Lam Court any more."}
{"text":"Fung Lam Court is a well lit, family style, authentic chinese restaurant.  This was the first time that I had ever tried authentic chinese food and it was definitley a unique experience.  The lamb chops they made were out of this world and to die for, same with the scambled egg with shrimp.

Dessert for me wasn't as much of a hit as I found it a bit to rich for my stomach, but then again I'm not used to that style of food.  All in all, it was a nice evening out with friends and I would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"My family tried this place out for dinner and were all disappointed with the meal. We got there at 5:30pm on a soon to be busy Saturday night, and they were nice enough to let us order some of the speciality items that were written on the front door board (as it was father's day weekend, once it got busy they would only do set menu dishes). So we ordered the following:

Free soup - peanuts and chicken feet. A bit watery.

Shrimp toast - While the toast part was nice and crispy and well deep fried, the shrimp wasn't overly fresh.

Large steamed scallops - at $9 a piece, we had it cooked 2 ways. The problem was that it was not fresh at all and was almost inedible due to the rancid smell (not to mention some sandy grit). We did complain to the owner and he was nice enough to give us 10% off the entire meal.

Stir fried pea shoots veggies - way to sweet. Someone must've switched the chef's salt with a sugar bowl. The chef's gotta learn to taste his own dish before sending it out!

Crunchy pork belly - meat was a bit on the dry side, sweet dipping sauce was watery. Nothing better than what you could buy at any chinese BBQ meat shop.

Specialty fish tail w/ mushrooms, pork and spinach - just a sloppy mess, fish was way overcooked and again not fresh.

Free range chicken w/ splash of alcohol seared. Sauce was way too salty, otherwise a very mediocre dish.

Desserts we had the sesame pudding, almond pudding, and the grass jelly (was too medicinal). I usually love chinese desserts, but I couldn't bring myself to have more than a spoon full of each.

The head chef was certainly there that night, since he did come out to greet this one other large table that was busy sampling various wines that they brought. Maybe the chef was too busy cooking up their dishes and got his apprentice to cook our table's dishes.

Despite many decent sized water tanks at the front of the resturant, our seafood choices were all of the unfresh variety.

Final bill came to $112 w/ the discount, no booze.  After this meal, we won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"A solid Chinese restaurant with good value. My mom dines at Fung Lam Court regularly with her friends and now I know why. The food is good, inexpensive and well-portioned. The service is also surprisingly attentive.

We ordered a variety dishes ranging from Peking duck to lobster and everything was good. Our table particularly enjoyed the shrimp toast, a throwback dish that reminded my mom of childhood dinners in Hong Kong. It consists of deep fried morsels of bread with prawns. It was not too greasy surprisingly!

The lobster was cooked nicely. As an added bonus, they used the lobster tomalley to make one of the tastiest fried riced dishes i've ever had. It might be a little strong for some, but it's definitely flavorful. The Peking duck, hand pulled chicken and lettuce wraps were also good. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another nice intimate evening with great friends, but totally new and exciting introduction to authentic Chinese food as well as the atmosphere! The restaurant itself is brightly lit, not blinding and nicely decorated with numerous large tables that easily accomodate 11 people plus adorned with the biggest Lazy Susan in the center of the table that I've ever seen. There was crab(w.garlic butter white wine sauce) OMG, curried beef, salt fish with tofu, sticky rice with ham/veggies, reg. rice, rice noodles and the others just kept coming. Oh! And yes, complimentary desserts of cashew and almond puree, sesame puree and a jellied cubed \"turtle essance\" served with a suryp to go with it. It's sure to get a RISE out of you later on! Tea is also served throughout the entire meal, always fresh! My favourite was definitely the crab! Restrooms were very clean and pleasent. Prices were more than reasonable. We recommend Fung Lam Court who wish a true taste of what a Chinese meal should be, come hungry! Well be back."}
{"text":"This is the most ridiculous experience ever... We ordered rum crab and they showed us a 3 pound crab with both clamps in place.  When the crab is served, both clamps are gone.  The funniest is the manager said we ate it but all shells are still on the table and no evidence of the clamps at all.  There is no point to argue but they keep insisting we ate it.  

Well. Still arguing now and guess what, I would rather recommend a bad tasting restaurant over any restaurant that is dishonest!"}
{"text":"I came here as part of a UYE arranged by the legendary duo of Jennifer K and Wayne C. I would say a comparison to the dynamic duo is not fair as there is no Robin to the Batman here, rather both are Batman when it comes to resourcefulness and planning. 5 Stars before the end credits roll through and through (where else does one get the ratio of almost a bottle of wine per person and I have been to French weddings!) 
This was a prearranged menu as the aforementioned duo had already carefully thought out the dishes. So here is the blow by blow
1) Soup with Pork heart and duck neck (I didn't try this dish) 
2) BC Crab in Rum Cream Sauce. This was the main attraction and didn't disappoint. It was served with bread rolls and/or rice. An interesting take on cooking this crustaceans as both ingredients are not associated with that region. The broth was served in a bowl for us to dunk the bread or rice and enjoy it. I tried it on its own first. Nice clean taste, not quite as creamy as clam chowder but a lot more intense IMO. Did feel the hint of rum in the broth which is quite nice. Crab itself benefited from this prep method as it was nicely balanced. Highlight of the menu.
3) Beef Ho Fun. A nice way to judge a kitchen's (some people would say  Gai-Lan is a better yardstick but this is a close enough) . Not the best prep I have had. A bti greasy IMO.
4) Chicken and Tofu. This one was a miss. Just an intense salt kick turned me off and I didn't indulge much afterwards.
5) Steamed Chicken with the whole bird on display (even the head). Average.
6) Braised Duck with Taro. The duck meat was moist and had a clean finish. Decent.
7) Sticky rice with sausage. I skipped this one.
8) Rice vermicelli with shredded duck and cabbage. Very good prep here. Clean finish not even a hint of grease. I would say it was a good palate cleanser as the next course needed it.
9) Pan roasted lamb chops. I had skipped a few courses earlier so I got two of these chops :D (thanks dynamic duo!) A surprise dish as I don't expect it from this region. I would say if you have tried dishes in Maggi sauce this one comes close in taste. Perfectly pink in the middle nice sweet honey finish. I would say it was tied to the top item on the menu. I would order it again. 
10) Curry beef brisket. Mild curry with potatoes and beef tendon (I think it was tendon) More of a filler. 
11) Sliced pork with lotus roots. Skipped.
12) Omelette with shrimp. Decent. 
Desserts - Almond, Cashew, Black Sesame soups and Herbal Jelly. Cashew soup was good. Black sesame and almond were what one expects I suppose. Herbal Jelly is more for the after party :D as I had to drown it in syrup just to finish my serving. 
Over all I would say two dishes really stood out but for all this goodness at a reasonable amount more of nit picking here. 
3 Stars for the food with half star bump given for value and service."}
{"text":"Fung Lam has become my new dim sum hotspot for those mornings when I'm craving their great variety of Chinese food staples. Ive been here on multiple occasions and the staff has been consistently friendly each visit. The food is always great and all the traditional items are right on point. Compared to other Chinese restaurants their service here is always pleasant and courteous no matter how busy it gets.

Edit: after multiple visits (4 approx) during peak dim sum hours it's clear that there are issues with consistency.  It doesn't detract greatly from the overall quality but would be a nice issue to fix."}
{"text":"This restaurant's menu, compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area that I have been to was rather small and the food was on the more salty side. Also, the menu was not really reader friendly at all. The menu was written all in Chinese so for people that don't know how to read Chinese, I wonder how they would order. In addition, unlike other Chinese restaurants that I have tried in the area, this restaurant doesn't offer set dinners for a group less then 6 people. 
The servers at the restaurant was nice but I have to say the service level was a bit  unpolished."}
{"text":"Went here for a Saturday morning dim sum.  

Atmosphere is no frills and nothing fancy. It's your typical tables with white plastic for easy changeover, beige wallpaper, bar area used mainly for lineups of food bills and a big aquarium with sea life that will become someone's meal.

The food is quite good as far as doing dim sum items right and the service is quite attentive. Items that were supposed to be chewy were, items supposed to be crispy were and items that supposed to keep together and not fall apart easily did just that."}
{"text":"We went to Fung Lam Court Chinese 7220 Kennedy Road Unit 6 Markham Ontario L3R 0N4 +1-905-947-8988 for Dim Sum twice in the last week. Once with our good friend @luxual and once on our own.
They are open 7 days a week 9 a.m. to 11 pm. They serve Dim Sum for $2.40 Monday to Friday, and for $2.70 Saturday, Sunday and Holidays.
The kitchen is run by a father and son duo. The father oversees the enormous kitchen while the son, George Brown trained, is the chef and is responsible for the menu. We met Margaret, the chef's sister who, when we were there, was playing the roll of secret shopper in the open, checking on the front of the house and how things were working. After all the restaurant has only been open for six weeks.
On our first visit we tried many traditional Dim Sum dishes, which we enjoyed, as well as Shrimp Toast ($5.50) and all three Sweet Soups: Sesame, Almond and Cashew Nut ($4.75 each). The Shrimp toast was served hot and was quite tasty. The Sweet Soups, served as a dessert item, were quite identifiable as Sesame Almond and Cashew Nut.
There are two menus during the day one for Dim Sum, the other for specialty items. Of the close to 50 items only 9 cost more than $10.00. There is also a four page dinner menu.
Margaret insisted that we should return for dinner and highly recommended the Crab baked with rum and bread, the Crab pan fried with Soya sauce and Beef Rib with Honey Pepper.
We will most certainly return in the new year."}
{"text":"It has been a long winding road for me to discover the true colour of Fung Lam.  Firstly, I only discovered that this location had changed ownership, when I visited a bakery in the same mall last month.  I then had dim sum brunch here once, and the limited selection did not impress me.  The food tasted average, and the restaurant was half empty at prime brunch hours.  After the dim sum experience, I was not sure I would even try its dinner, even though some menu items seemed unique.

Fast forwarded to last Sunday, the Mother's Day.  Silly us thought that we did not need a reservation for an early dinner, like 5:30pm.  Of course, after being turned away by three restaurants, I remembered this half-emptied restaurant.  We were lucky that, among a full house, one table was leaving when we arrived.  We were so happy when we sat down.

It was with this bad attitude that I discovered the true colour of Fung Lam.  We ordered a set menu for four ($68) that included a 1.5lb lobster, a steamed bass, half a chicken and a vegetable stir fry.  All the food was cooked perfectly.  The ingredients were fresh, especially the fish.  Nothing was over-seasoned or under-seasoned; they hit the right balance of taste that I liked.  The fish was cooked with skills, meaning the flesh was barely lingering on the bones but there was no blood color on the meat.  What was most impressive was that I knew they were mass producing the food.  This meal was a testimony of a well-run and competent kitchen led by a strong chef.  My kudo!

I also have had the best free dessert experience at a Chinese restaurant to date.  There were 4 choices!  Almond tea, tortoise jelly, black sesame pudding and cashew pudding.  Not the common red/green bean pudding.  I didn't know I could get tortoise jelly for free!

I took 1 star off because the complimentary starter soup was late, like after 2 main dishes had arrived. In addition, the dim sum experience was indeed average."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The standard dim sum fare is very good, excellent taste and price. Try the seafood soup special (more like a chowder), it's lovely, definitely something you'll never find at another Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"After hearing about Fung Lam Court for the better part of six to eight months I dined there last night with some friends -- and it delivered, big time!  The first thing that must be said is that Chef/owner Wing Lai presides over a friendly, welcoming establishment filled with regulars, and that he takes enormous pride in the quality Cantonese food produced (we had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with his daughter Margaret as well).  The second point to underscore is the freshness of the cuisine and the ingredients, particularly the seafood (tanks of eel, crab, and lobster line the entry way).  The menu is large and we had done some homework, scouring reviews and then chatting with Betty, our waitress, before ordering. We opened with a delightful retro item done impeccably, shrimp toast, and then moved on to a very delicate soup of fish maw and crab before hunkering down to some spectacular platters.  The restaurant is known for its BC crab with rum sauce, a dish that steps outside a strictly Cantonese tradition but does not disappoint!  Legend has it that Wing Lai, when teaching culinary arts at George Brown, traded a Peking duck recipe for the basic outline of this dish and then modified to make it his own. It's very rich, with plenty of butter and top shelf rum, and is almost french in sensibility (the baguettes that come for dipping accentuate this Gallic touch).  If you here with a large party, definitely order this item (which, we were told, on request could be prepared with lobster) but if your table is a deuce, best to pass as it will fill you up.  A braised duck with preserved plum sauce and taro was top notch, the tartness of the plum playing off the sweet duck in beautiful fashion, the starchy taro lending substance. For our table the highlight may have been a crispy fresh eel served with onions and honey pepper sauce, a dish that appears on the menu with several other options.  This was crispy on the outside, moist and delicate inside, with nice robust flavour thanks to the balanced sauce.  We also had a very rustic pork belly with preserved vegetable, a dish that isn't often found (at least not done well) outside of home kitchens. We finished with special dessert:  four sweet soups, black sesame, cashew, almond, and green bean.  Quite an experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Took the recommendation of Allison Y's review and got the $68 combo for our party of 5. Just like Allison mentions it comes with lobster, steamed bass, plate of veggies and half a chicken. Not a bad price for what you get. The lobster and steamed bass was a bit small. Also ordered for an additional $22 fried eel which was cooked just the way I like. Crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Not a big fan of the sauce they used on the eel or the lobster. Tasted like soy sauce to me. Meal ended with a selection of sweet soup. Overall a good recommendation by Allison. Will definitely be back for eel as I'm obsessed with finding the best place for eel."}
{"text":"Fung Lam Court sounds familiar? It used to be located at East Beaver Creek and Hwy 7 before it closed down for business years ago...

This newly opened Fung Lam Court does have the same name and logo and similar menu..

A mixture of Cantonese and Chiu Chow items in the menu for one to choose from. We decided on 

Braised Duck with Sour Plum and Taro ($12) and Fresh bean curd with mushrooms and vegetables ($10.50). The duck meat was soft and tender but I found the sauce a little too sour and the vegetable dish was a little too salty for my taste.

The winner though was the complimentary dessert!! 3 Choices of house made dessert to choose from includes Cashew based sweet soup which is quite a special offerings which hardly available in other Chinese restaurants I been to!

Services are a little too attentive. But since Fung Lam Court just opened so hopefully that will improve over time!

There are some unique items on the menu like the stir fried Chinese doughnut stuffed with shrimp paste?!"}
{"text":"I genuinely hope that we had a miscommunication at the end of our meal. I asked whether they take reservations for dim sum. The woman replied that yesterday was the last day that they would be offering dim sum. Perhaps she misunderstood the question or I misunderstood the answer.

Onto the meal. We had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated, which matched the estimate that we were given when we arrived. We were seated at a large table with two ladies who turned out to be very nice. They even offered us some of their food! Tables and chairs are the only seating options. As to the demographic distribution, I haven't felt that out of place since my brilliant in-laws hosted a detailed algebra discussion. I'm not a purist, and I don't care about authenticity but if you do, then this is the place for you. We saw two other non-Asians. Two.

It's kind of a mixed carts/menu system. You order from the dim sum menu, but they also have servers walking around with treats on trays.

All dishes were quite tasty. Slight problem when one of the dishes didn't conform to my allergies, but that may have been a linguistic glitch. The bill for two including beer came to $49 and we had leftovers to feed the multitudes.

I'd go back, unless they really did stop serving dim sum. Seems hard to believe since the place was packed. There's a parking lot, but finding a spot is a challenge."}
