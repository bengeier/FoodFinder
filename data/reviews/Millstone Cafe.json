{"text":"This cute, well decorated and clean establishment in the middle of \"downtown\" Buckeye, AZ shines like a beacon in a storm. Recently it was named as the ONLY restaurant in Buckeye by the Maricopa Co. Health Dept. to get an excellent rating, which means no violations at all. I only mention this because if you've been in any other establishments in this tiny, historic, albeit run down town, this means a lot. Heck, it means a lot in any town! 

Millstone Cafe serves espresso drinks (my life's blood), breakfast and lunch items. I've eaten both breakfast and lunch here and have been delighted with the quality, preparation, and value of the food I've ordered. My spinach, strawberry and feta with grilled chicken salad the other day was great and so big I had to take about half of it home. The owners are cordial and take customer service seriously (another element lacking in this little corner of the planet).  I'd like Millstone even better if they would start using a more premium espresso bean, like Illy or Stumptown, but then look where I am. I should be grateful for my latte and enjoy it, eh? The next espresso cafe is a long way down the road!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Millstone today.  Cute place! The chicken cashew salad was great. Love the taste of the chicken salad as well as the herbed flatbread. For dessert I had a huge cinnamon roll...warm and gooey just the way I like it.  Coffee was geeat too. Seems like everyone knows each other...very friendly atmosphere.  Great place to visit if you're in Buckeye!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners and staff. The food was excellent and my latte was good. A very nice sursprise for downtown Buckeye. Will be going back with friends and family members."}
{"text":"Another great gem in downtown Buckeye. The set up is cute in a little house with nice the tables where you can play board games. Had the Philly and it was a nice big portion and pretty tasty. Has a whole coffee shop menu but didn't try any beverages. Will be coming back to give other things on the menu a shot and enjoy a drink to support a small business instead of driving through the main chain coffee spots"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch as we were traveling on the 10.  The place was clean and the service was fast and pleasant.  I had a Chicken Salad Sandwich which was wonderful with a mixture of flavors.  I also ordered the Potato Salad which I almost never do because I am usually disappointed but not this time it was delicious with lots of egg and some mustard.  Gave us large to go cups of Ice Tea with lemon which were refilled as we left.  A great place to visit."}
{"text":"I have written a review for this place before. I stopped in there today and I tried something new. The coleslaw was absolutely awesome.  The owner told me that he makes fresh as you order it. The vegetables are nice and crunchy.  So many restaurants having soggy coleslaw but this really good. I must confess that I  had a philly cheese steak again. I should order something different sometime, but why mess with perfection. I have never been to Philadelphia, but it is hard to imagine that they make one better. My wife really enjoyed her Ruben sandwich. She said it was one of the best she has ever had. 
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their breakfast bagel with ham & eggs hit the spot, white mocha was delicious! Owners are extremely friendly. Extremely clean and cute shop!"}
{"text":"For me, atmosphere is equal to taste when it comes to coffeeshops, and Millstone does a good job on both fronts.

The cafe's front has a few easy chairs and the counter, while the back room provides more seating for folks who are interested in hanging around for awhile.

Their espresso is a bit weak for my taste, but it was still tasty.  I am also a fan of their chocolate chip cookies, which I think are homemade.

The menu definitely provides a wider range of options than you'll find in most Buckeye establishments, but I don't know that I'd call it adventurous - mostly sandwiches and breakfast plates."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Buckeye. We come every Saturday for breakfast and Hortencia,the owner, takes great care of us and takes great pride in her restaurant. You can taste the live in the food. Biscuits and gravy are amazing!! Omelets are amazing! The chorizo burrito is just like gramma used to make. The portions are also just perfect, not too little and not so much food you can't finish it all. My husband and I highly recommend everyone coming here at least once if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  I love the fact that they are adventurous in their menu ingredients.  The only small problem is the service.  They get pretty busy at times and I've been given the wrong drink at least 2 times.  I continue going there for the food quality and price.  They really are very friendly but need to hire more people!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute a real mom and poo feeling which I absolutely love. I got the peanut butter latte... BOMB! so so so, is go back just for that... I have a peanut butter obsession so this caught me right in the feels. I also ate their homemade. Biscuits and gravy. SUPER delicious also. They make the sausage gravy from scratch and that's what I LOVE. I recommend this place. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The owners are great. I love the coffee and blended drinks and their patty melt. They do get busy but they're still quick. I believe it's only two people that work there but they're still quicker than Sonics."}
{"text":"Cute, clean and good food! The owner is a scary woman who always looks mean, but she's nice enough.  The inside temperature is always on the warm side,  especially in the summer months.  They have board games to play while waiting for food.  It's a cozy place to have lunch.  They could extend their hours."}
{"text":"They have a vast variety of coffees that are absolutely amazing! We tried their breakfast today and was just as pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This is my first bad review. This morning I went to get a couple of cups of coffee. Perhaps the lady wasn't having the greatest of days. I'll try it again sometime and hopefully catch her in a better mood. The coffee wasn't the greatest either."}
{"text":"Great place for a tasty simple sandwich at an affordable price.  Staff is friendly but not intrusive.  Food is good but nothing fancy.  It's my go to on \"Main Street\"."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a very long time,  and I've always wanted to try it.  Be careful what you wish for.  Yuck.  Very limited breakfast menu, and I should have went with my instincts and left when she told me you can't Cook an omelette without Browning the eggs unless you Cook it I
In a microwave.  Can you say cooking School? I was Leary so I ordered a country burrito (eggs,  green pepper,  onion and potatoes - listed on the menu in that order) for $4.99. If you want a potato burrito with one egg and a sprinkle of veggies,  then this is the place to go! I complained and she still charged me for it.  Lots of signage about how it's the best breakfast in Buckeye. Huh???"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. I will be coming back to eat here weekly. Amazing breakfast and sandwiches. Thank you for great service and food!!"}
{"text":"Never been in a restaurant with ambiance like the Millstone, it's quite relaxed and the owners are always friendly. Definitely going there again, seeing as it was voted the best breakfast in buckeye it definitely lives up to its name."}
{"text":"I find the staff to be extremely rude and dismissive. Everything I order is always so dry it chokes me (bagel sandwich, chicken salad for 2 examples). They do have delicious coffee though. I'd go way more frequently for the coffee if I didn't feel so uncomfortable due to their attitudes. 

Update: The owner contacted me via Yelp and was somewhat apologetic, thought I couldn't quite take it seriously when he's bringing up their finances and health in the same message. As a consumer, I should never be brought into a business owner's financial \"struggles\" (for lack of a better word). I shouldn't have to feel cornered due to MY opinion on a site made for just that."}
{"text":"Love this place.   It's my go to lunch spot in Buckeye.  The food is consistent and light.  The owners are friendly and welcoming.   The Chicken salad sandwich and strawberry spinach salad are my favorites.

{"text":"This is like our home away from home...The owners prepare the most scrumptious food with LOVE..amazing ingredients..I'm addicted to the salsa on the SO reasonable breakfast platter...The cinnamon rolls are divine and the coffee superb...Best place by farIn the west valley...bar none...Family owned...Not a chain...They care10'a"}
{"text":"First and last time visitor to Millstone. Admittedly, I'm not a coffee drinker, so as far as that goes I can't say. But nearly $10.00 for a soda, a bag of chips (no fries) and an unremarkable cheeseburger is a bit steep in my opinion. The staff was neither friendly or rude, indifferent is a good way to describe the vibe there. It wasn't horrible, but down the street at Sonic I can get a better cheeseburger, fries and a soda for $3.00 less."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the Buckeye Area.  I had the tuna salad pizza...sounds weird, but it was actually pretty tasty!  Service was attentive and friendly.  Seems like there were quite a few regulars so that was cool to see."}
{"text":"I work in Buckeye and am getting sick of having Subway every single day, so I thought I'd try something new. Millstone Cafe is an adorable little establishment. It's clean (unlike other places in downtown Buckeye) and the staff is very friendly. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with coleslaw. The coleslaw is homemade and very good. The sandwich was yummy too. The ONLY complaint I have is that I felt 8.00 for lunch was a little pricey, but I will definitley return occasionally for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment going in expecting to buy coffee and get out. I'm from California visiting, and walking in I said I've never been here may I see a menu? Since there is no menu in front of me. And the cashier gives it to me and tells me to sit in a different room and they'll take my order. I stated I'll just stand thank you I just want coffee and repeats herself sit in the room we'll take your order. Not understanding why I need to sit? For coffee? When I walked And there was nobody in the store at all. Me and my brother wait after 10 minutes doesn't come to us. So I walk up to her and stated I need to order a coffee and I'm leaving after. And says that's all you want?! Wow okay I'll make it. What do you want... asking for the coffee and says well I need to know a size?! I tell her medium and charges me. Put the change on the counter when I had my hand out and the receipt and walks away without a goodbye to a different room with her coworker. Worst thing she say is by the bathroom! When there was seats open in the front! I give this two stars because of her horrible service but the coffee wasn't to bad"}
{"text":"Super cute little cozy place. Came in for breakfast super excited. Ordered coffee, had to go to the Counter to get refills. Waited over 45 minutes for our food and it was horrible. Got biscuits and gravy, the biscuits weren't fully cooked and the sausage inside of the gravy had the texture of pure fat. Also ordered a side of potatoes and those were under cooked on the inside and burnt on the outside. And on top of it the cinnamon roll was cold! Not impressed at all. Although my friend ordered the chorizo wrap and he said it was good. Maybe stick with that"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here! It's my go to coffee place and the food is really good for a good price! The owners are super nice and always remember when I come in. So glad I found an awesome little joint like this."}
{"text":"I have probably passed this place a million times and not even noticed it. I saw someone walking out with an iced coffee the other day and turned around. I am a coffee snob and will drive from by millstone to Litchfield for Dutch almost daily. I was pleased with how awesome the espresso is!"}
