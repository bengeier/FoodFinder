{"text":"Was excited to try this place with the reviews. Ordered delivery, but the pizza doesn't come until an hour and 20 minutes later, 35 minutes after they said they would. It came, and of course, it was cold. I had to put it in the microwave. Called her and told her she said she would give me $2 off the next order which was ridiculous.  Pizza was okay otherwise, usual greasy cheesy pizza. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Love at first bite also has a second menu with all Thai food! I visited with Laura T and wasn't in a pizza mood, so I ordered off their vegetarian Thai menu. I had the tofu stirfy with steamed rice. It was a nice simple dish with lots of tofu and plenty of large pieces of broccoli and bok choy. It was only $6.95! Very great service as always - love the owners. Other  options include pad Thai, spicy curries, cashew  nut dishes, spicy beef, and egg or rice noodle dishes."}
{"text":"The owners of this establishment are so friendly and welcoming! I go there frequently whenever I'm in the area. Their food is DELICIOUS and all reasonably priced for the quality and portions of the dish. I would highly recommend their chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"Love this place. Live in the area and I have their number on my phone. I usually order pad thai or pizza, cheap and delicious.   A cute couple runs this restaurant and they always have the food ready in 15 min."}
{"text":"Love at first bite didn't do for us. We wanted to grab something good and vegetarian and it happened to be pad thai with tofu what we chose. There were, seemed two regular customers eating close to us in a clean and simple little room. Food came within 10 minutes and didn't look very appetizing. We have had pad thai in other places, but it didn't resemble to our loved Danforth's Family Thai's  pad thai. The thing is that it didn't have that red look and flavor that is usual, it was pretty plain and a bit oily in our opinion. It was cheap though, only $6.95 + tax. Service was nice. Got to refill our water bottle after we asked, from their tap.   Maybe we would give better reviews if we would have tasted their pizza, as the slices there looked very yummy, but we just weren't in mood for that or we should try the other stuff."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place when I'm at Ryerson! The pizza is good, made with fresh ingredients and affordable for a student budget.  A mini pizza is plenty for one girl at lunch time, a small was good for two and it came served on a stand (nice touch!).   Also on offer is Thai food which I haven't tried... yet."}
{"text":"As a Ryerson student, this charming hole-in-the-wall pizzeria has satisfied me many a time.   Love at First Bite is a great place to grab fresh, delicious pizza at a good price. You're able to order slices that are ready right away, or wait for a pizza (personal to large) hot from the oven that's brought to your table quickly and with a smile.  There are plenty of tables to sit at as well as a take out counter separate from the eat-in section of the restaurant. Although the decorations aren't fancy, the food is great and reasonably priced. The staff has never been anything but pleasant and accommodating. Their delivery man is also quite a hoot..  Love at First Bite also offers other food items such as Thai food! Very clever, and much better than any Ryerson campus alternatives."}
{"text":"Good cheap pizza.   Get a slice and a pop for under $5."}
{"text":"Love at First Bite, in addition to having one of the best Pizza Place names, is located in a great spot.  It's across the street from Ryerson, and on the first floor of Neil Wycik.  They have a sit down restaurant section which is an increasingly rare thing among pizza places.  They also have a take out counter which is probably how they do most of their business, what with university students grabbing a slice and running to class.  Their slice on demand pizza has never been something I've yearned for.  It's good, but not amazing.  Part of this is because it never really feels fresh that way.  Maybe if you go at the right time and grab one of the freshly made slices, it'd be a different experience, but I've never had such luck.  That said, I see lots of potential here, and have no trouble imagining a great pizza from them.  Unfortunately, I've never ordered a whole pizza from here, but that's something that I think would be a real treat.  That way, you get the freshest possible pizza.  But until I actually do that, only 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Slice amongst Toronto Universities period, then they changed ownership :(.     It's just ok now, but amazing sauce, crust too light now and cheese is average. Wah!"}
{"text":"Food was good and cheap. I liked the variety of pizza and Asian fare.   At that price, it's great that there's seating room and they serve alcohol!  Only complaint is that the cashier/server/owner? kept forgetting orders."}
{"text":"I think the place is under new ownership. No more Thai food, sushi or pasta. Pizza tasted totally different, was a little watery and under cooked. Really disappointed...can the old couple who used to own it come back?!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint! I'm from the States and try to always stick to local, non-chain eateries wherever I travel. (Thanks, Yelp!)  Love At First Bite isn't overly warm and friendly if you're not a regular -- but hey, that's true \"New York\" style. You can't beat a made-to-order personal pie and beer for just 10 bucks. Plentiful, greasy cheese and all the fixings (Parmesan, red pepper, garlic, etc.) to shake on top of it. Fast, no frills, no negatives!"}
