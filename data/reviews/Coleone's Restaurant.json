{"text":"Fantastic pizza. We went for lunch and ate until there was nothing left to take home. (Guess who is skipping dinner)  We ordered the Hawaiian which came late, because the wrong size was made. The owner came out and apologized. He found out our son has a peanut allergy and spent several minutes with us discussing how his son has the same allergy. They are peanut free, other than Becker's deserts that are brought in. They made special mint shakes made for the kids.. we would definitely recommend getting a shake.  Great experience and our new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"We have become \"regulars\" here!  Good food and nice bar. The Cuban pizza is our favorite, and the bartender is the most creative Mixologist we have ever seen. Slightly upscale pizza and bar, but casual and not pretentious, sounds like Avon Lake!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Went online to see the menu, place an order for pick up but the website is down. So I called and the woman informed me the website isn't working, said \"sorry\" and hung up! She offered zero assistance, I'm sure she was near a stack of menus and still could have taken an order. I have had the pizza in the past and its decent, but we wanted to try something new as they have a huge menu.  Oh well, guess not!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my daughter.Service was good but the food and my ice cold cup of coffee was not.The waitress wanted to heat it up in a microwave instead of brewing a fresh pot of decaf. Go figure......"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in for a quick meal, that turned into a great date night! We started with the fried cheese appetizer and then I had the Chicken Piccata. It was delicious! The chicken was so tender, it practically melted in my mouth! My husband had a custom mac & cheese, where you get to choose up to three toppings.  He chose steak, basil & tomato and it was rich and creamy. We finished our meal with Fonseca Bin 27 port and a decadent triple chocolate cake! Our server, Kevin, took great care of us and made excellent suggestions! From start to finish, an exceptional meal! Definitely on our list of favorite places!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family to eat lunch today and we had a really great experience. After a small misunderstanding regarding my order, the staff went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction and I really appreciated it. I had the bruschetta and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend for a tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"A great pizza. Look forward to returning. The service was great and the pizza was better than we expected"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! Early morning breakfasts seven days a week and amazing food! Clean clean clean and reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to have breakfast and a hot cup of coffee. Good food and nice atmosphere. Only minor complaint is breakfast stops at 10:30am, 11am would be more ideal for me. I have had their pizza in the past, and it is a really good pie."}
{"text":"This is a brunch review:  Arrived on a Sunday morning to find Fox News blaring and more than a couple flies making it difficult to sit still.  Their signature breakfast sandwich was pretty good, with thick and airy Italian bread, but it was over-sauced. Scrambled eggs were below average, and french toast was not as good as you might make at home. It was simply white bread with no real flavor whatsoever. The syrup had an odd taste, as if maybe it had been around a bit too long. Orange juice from concentrate and very watered down. The coffee was nothing special.  There seemed to be just one woman working the floor, and she was also being trained on how to use the cash register, so things were slow. She was nice though.  One of those \"I wish we'd gone somewhere else\" kind of experiences."}
{"text":"Guinness on tap is a bonus. Service has been good. Every pizza we've had has been great. This is our pizza go to spot now. Extra star for the tater tots! Order them plain with the cheese sauce on the side. When they come to your table they are hot! You might burn your lip if you get in a hurry to eat them. (I did) Add a little bit of grated Parmesan to them when they get to the table. Yum yum. We will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but it is going down hill. Not sure if when the original owners sold the business if the new owner changed the ingredients or what but I used to really like this place before and now I don't. Not sure if they changed ingredients from the prior owner or what but the last two times I went here ( last time was yesterday) the pizza dough was either flat in the middle or had air pockets near the crust(I used to work at a pizza place in highschool so I know that's just not rolling the dough properly or making the dough right). It had no flavor and tasted like one of those cheap dominos or little Caesars pizzas. The buffalo wings had no favor or sauce and the cheesy garlic bread was dry and flavorless. I did not write a review the last time as I figured sometimes you just have a bad day but now it seems consistently mediocre or below but the price of a high end pizza place. I therefore think I will take them out of my line up of go to places."}
{"text":"Been there for dinner and breakfast.  The owner is very nice the staff is very friendly they have a nice breakfast good pizza try to Sweet and sassy.  We even take carry out nice local restaurant very reasonable"}
{"text":"I like this place b/c it feels like home! Everyone is very friendly and the service is great. Getting a pie and numerous dortmunder golds!"}
{"text":"Food here is great. Staff is very friendly when dining in. One of the best pizza places around."}
{"text":"I go into this restaurant every weekday and I ask them to turn off that jazz music they play... Yes I said jazz. The last thing you want to hear is music that puts you back to sleep... So until they change the station I'm eating elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of our go to spots. From the outside, you would never guess that inside is a cutely decorated and truly nice little Italian restaurant. My fiancé and I have been here several times for dinner and once for breakfast. My fiancé always gets their calzones, which he is a big fan of. I have tried several of their pizzas. My favorite is the New York style pepperoni. It is thin crust. It's up there as some of the best pizza I've had in Cleveland. The prices are reasonable and the service is great. The bartender, I believe his name is Sean, is really nice, and makes great drinks. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any menu items other than pizza. I was confused by the other reviews, because I think of Coleone's as a nice pizza/beer restaurant, and everyone else is talking about breakfast??? Being from Columbus, I LOVE ohio-style pizza. Unfortunately, that doesn't exist here in Cleveland. Coleone's is one of the few places that doesn't fit into the mega-chain pizza places that seems to dominate this area. Their specialty pizzas are all great. Also, they offer \"breakfast sausage\" if you prefer small, crumbled pieces instaed of the standard large hunks."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a change... Ugh!  More of the same.  I'm sad the moved closer to me!"}
