{"text":"Was introduced to Organic Burger by the crew at the office one day after work and was impressed by the quality of their meats; although their fries are a bit on the soggy side and the seating leaves something to be desired (a minor qualm, and not something easily remedied) it was more than made up for the burgerfied buffalo I had that day. It IS reminiscent of Five Guys, but is more akin to 4.25 Guys. Still a great value for burgers in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto for business and after a week of eating mostly vegetables, I was ready for cow. Saw this place a couple of times, and decided to stop in today. Family owned, by a couple who apparently met there many years ago (bonus points for me, a sentimential italian kid). 

Great Burgers, reminiscent of Five Guys. If you dont know five guys, think fresh organic beef, buffalo and chicken, even some other seasonal meat burgers. They use fresh ground brisket, for an incredibly beefy taste, and a decent spice mix.

 Good Quality ingredients all around, and a friendly staff. No credit cards, so bring a functioning canadian debit card or some of thier funny money."}
{"text":"Go big or go home, When a Canadian is craving beef they want it slapped between two buns. 

I came here for lunch as I was tired of eating the same old burger over and over again."}
