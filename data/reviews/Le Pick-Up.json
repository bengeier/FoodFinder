{"text":"Are you a vegetarian? Do you like delicious sandwiches? Of course you do.  Go here. Eat all the sandwiches.  Veggie pulled pork. Grilled Halloum. Breakfast sandwich with veggie ham. I'm sure it's delicious if you're a meat eater too, but I don't care about that.  Bonuses - cute atmosphere. lovely staff. also a dep, for all your snack/beer/minor household needs."}
{"text":"Amazing faux pulled pork. Sweet and tucked away and cheap but high quality food and don't tell but they totally have $1.25 bottomless drip coffee. If they only had more seating I'd bring 10 friends at once! But you're right in the dep, which is equal parts of charming and annoying."}
{"text":"Un peu déçue par mon sub steak qui était assez petit, pas spécialement bon ou mauvais et assez caoutchouteux. Bref ça ne valait sûrement pas 9$. À 5$ je n'aurais rien dit. Sinon le service était courtois, et la place possède un certain cachet (hipster alert!)"}
{"text":"This is Le Pick Up's claim to fame. Slow roasted pulled pork sandwich in barbecue sauce, served with grilled peppers, coleslaw on a Portuguese style bun. REALLY tasty. Straight up. There was a certain zing to the barbecue sauce and it was complimented perfectly with the crunchy slaw directly in the sandwich. All it was missing was fries and they could have called it a \"Po'Garçon\"."}
{"text":"There is nothing like the pick up. Nothing. Go there. Now. Eat everything.   Best drip coffee ever. I live nearby specifically to eat here more. I bring all my friends and out of town guests here. I always make a bet \"if you don't love it, I'll pay\" -- I've never lost."}
{"text":"one of the best casual brunches out there. delicious, cheap, friendly and fun. they're happy to turn anything veggie or vegan if you ask, but the pulled pork is famous.  love the sunny terrace!"}
{"text":"Came on suggestion from a veggie friend who used to live in the area. The veggie pulled pork was incredible. It is  made of  seitan and it is absolutely delicious. One of the best veggie sandwiches I have ever had. Also had the halloumi which was also perfect. Wish I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Le Pick Up (a very artsy deps in Montreal) is my target for lunch today! Well-received Faux (veggie \"porc\") pulled pork is a must-eat here! Awesome! I have never eaten a vegetarian pull pork, replacing pork with chinese vegetarian bean-curd to allow for the shredding pulled pork texture! Then topped with tangy and spicy sauce, caraway seeds, pepper, preserved pickle, sweet chili, jalapeño, caramelized onions, vinegary slaw stuffed high between 2 slices of chewy bun! It's a mammoth, my $6.75 was well spent!   Service is prompt but expect to wait for 15 minutes to get your items whipped up on a weekend. They even send us a bottle of ice water with clean cups while waiting at the empty communal table, so thoughtful! I guess the heat wave is driving me crazy these days in Montreal but nothing beats this crazier yummy creation by Le Pick-up.  The inner space is a little cramped but the patio has a couple of dining tables and seats as well as in the \"secret garden\" at the backyard. I saw a stairway leading to a second level which I do not know if another dining hall exist? The place is just full of artsy vibes!!!!    If you are looking to get some cookies, condiments, canned items, they have a few on the shelve, I am seeing my fave maple cookies that I almost sweep it into my bag! I now figured why they are called dépanneur, because they started out as a convenient store! Cool!!"}
{"text":"Nice joint! Take the best-selling pulled pork sandwich and you will be satisfied! It's nice, juicy, fresh and has an amazing taste! I would recommend to take home potatoes as side dish. After taking this lunch you will be thinking  about a nap :-)"}
{"text":"\"It sometimes happens and will sometimes happen again that I forget who I am and strut before my eyes, like a stranger.\"  i was short for superlatives when the waitress asked me how my pulled pork was.. 'really really good' was all i could muster.   as a measure, the most \"really's\" in a row i've given before proclaiming something was good was 3, her name was jezebel.   i want to assure you that two really's are seldom uttered in rapid succession, i don't throw them around lightly.    the pulled pork was really really good.   note - the prices on their website are currently out of date, in most cases the sandwiches were $0.50 - 1 dollar more than what's indicated."}
{"text":"Unique spot with a big patio and friendly staff. I've been here twice for the daily sandwich specials during the busy lunch rush and will definitely come back. I'd add a star if the sandwiches were $1-2 less, or if you got a side with them."}
{"text":"Yum, stop by this place to pick up some delicious pulled pork sandwiches on your way to/from the market.  So good."}
{"text":"This little unassuming neighbourhood spot serves some great sandwiches! They are a small little grocery shop with limited indoor seating and a patio. The sandwiches areade to order and they're busy. The orders kept coming in while I was waiting for mine and it wasn't even during peak hours. The halloumi was good; loved the squeaky cheese and the flavors. Hubby had the steak and said it was great."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch after hearing very good reviews from friends. It did not disappoint. I had the special which was a lemongrass beef sandwich with Kim-chi. It was so good! my friend had the pulled pork that looked really awesome. Although, I've REALLY thirsty ever since.   The atmosphere is very laid-back casual but clean. Waiters were great. Very friendly and checking up with us often to make sure everything was good.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Good music for a Saturday morning.Cool neighbourhood joint. They were there from the very beginning."}
{"text":"after 2 subsequent visits in the company of my mom, we received terrible service followed by the rush to push us out. Evidently, they are doing such good business they've too many customers & have to get rid of some. Me, for example."}
{"text":"i live for places like this and if there was one in my neighborhood I would go there every day. It's an eatery hidden inside a convenience store with a fresh, delicious, and inexpensive menu. Try the 'pulled porc' and you will not be disappointed. Downsides: seating is limited, wait times are long, and it's best to bring cash but the food is worth it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork in the city, hands down - including the vegetarian version, which is delicious! They also make a fantastic iced coffee and have a super charming little patio in the back, which is the perfect place to spend a sunny Saturday morning. The kind of amazing in-between place that makes me adore Montreal. Just don't all go swarming the place, because this is my favourite neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"A breakfast and lunch place that's closed on Sundays? I get the reasoning but it still sucks."}
{"text":"This gem has now become widely known in Montreal. But despite being more mainstream, they have definitely kept their hipster roots. This is a perfect place to grab a sandwich to go or enjoy it on their terrace on a summers day. I highly recommend the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich as well as the vege pulled pork. Both are unique and spectacular. Also notable are their baked goods and homemade lemonade."}
{"text":"Dépanneur le Pick-Up is one of my favorite places in Montreal of all times for so many reasons, part of those reasons being that there's no other place like it in the city. It's located on a quiet residential street and attracts literally every single type of person from hipster to gangster and everything in between.   It's a cross between a good old dep and a diner, with a zine rack and an array of weird knick-knacks.  The coffee is really good and so is the food. Also, le Pick-Up takes the cake for best pulled-pork sandwich I've ever tasted. Worldwide. Yep.  **It's always packed so be prepared to wait for your food. Lots of outdoor seating in the summer time so you can enjoy a coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Lunchtime might be busy here but I enjoy the hustle and bustle of sitting at the counter and chatting with the chef while watching my food being made. Once you're a regular here, you'll get treated like family. Try the powermade in the summer: a delicious homemade hibicus iced tea, or try one of the best iced coffees in town (add your own sugar and milk! tasty espresso! ) During the week, if Michael made the soup of the day, always order it, he's amazing at it. Best breakfast sandwich ever: your choice of ham, bacon, cheddar or veggie ham, a fried egg, your choice of bread (including corn tortillas) lettuce, tomato, mayo- but they'll always let you add things for a few extra cents (i say do bacon AND cheddar, make the mayo chipotle and add hot peppers). This place is loud but friendly- if you're in town and you don't know anybody, here are some very sweet and funny people who will make you feel like you're among friends."}
{"text":"You know how heroin addicts always need their next fix? Well, I kind of feel that way about Le Pick-Up's faux pulled \"porc\". It is seriously the most glorious thing sandwiched between two buns. I am actually salivating as I write this and cannot wait until the next time I sink my teeth into it's edible deliciousness. The best part is that it's not tofu that they use but jack fruit for their \"porc\". Where they find jackfruit, I'm not sure. One day I will take the time out of my day to find out but for now I depend on Le Pick-Up for my fixture.   The staff is always friendly and they have fridges full of cool drinks like Curiosity Cola and what not. I like Boylan's Ginger Ale which they keep in stock. I could shower in it.  There are other sandwiches as well, but unfortunately I know nothing about them so its for you to find out. One of my friends swears by their tuna sandwiches and it runs out fast so best go early if you wanna dig into this fish sandwich.  Side note: A lot of people think the faux pulled \"porc\" is vegan but there is mayo in this sandwich so its best to skip the sauce if you wanna keep it \"ethical\" for all you vegans out there."}
{"text":"C'est un endroit que je fréquente sur une base régulière! Je m'y suis donc rendu pour le brunch samedi dernier! La bouffe était excellente comme d'habitude. C'est plutôt l'ambiance qui m'a surpris... charmé même! Du Jacques Brel à fond, rien de surprenant pour quelqu'un qui a connu les cafés du Plateau dans les années 90. Mais le choix des pièces étaient surprenantes, sans parler du staff toujours aussi coloré! Je me suis retrouvé dans cette ambiance anachronique dans un environnement, plus que Montréalais! Le Dépanneur Pick-Up est définitivement un incontournable!"}
{"text":"A classic of the Mile-end, let us hope that they continue to serve pulled pork in unpretentious surroundings well into the future."}
{"text":"Ce petit dépanneur, au milieu de nul part dans Little Italie, ne paye pas de mine mais le concept est vraiment chouette ! On peut y acheter un paquet de chips et même y casser la croute. C'est bon, très convivial et le staff est plutôt accueillant.   Une place atypique pour prendre un petit déjeuner / brunch à Montréal, que je recommande fortement !   Note : pour les lève-tard, le petit déjeuner n'est servi que jusqu'à 11:30AM"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have eaten here many times and have tried almost all of their menu items (it is not extensive). I fell in love with the ambiance and the food. The restaurant is in a corner store just off of Jean Talon - it's kind of like walking into a mum & pop Depanneur from the 70s. The pulled pork is fantastic but my favourite is their Grilled Haloum sandwich."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood joint. We keep going back and back. I've had many things on the menu, and it's always good. Great service, great atmosphere and great food.  The veggie pulled pork sandwich is a dream. My favourite sandwich in the world. I get cravings for it, I go, and am never disappointed. Please note that I'm not a vegetarian, and still prefer the veggie option. It's just so good. Oh, and they'll serve it on corn tortillas if you want to switch it up sometime."}
{"text":"Very cute/cool place.  I was at Stade Uniprix for tennis (Rogers Cup) and instead of eating there, we decided to take a short walk to find some REAL food.  So glad we did!  We would've never come here otherwise!    Delicious sandwiches for under ten bucks.  We tried the special of the day (Cuban), the pulled pork, and the steak sub.  Yummy!!!  Lots of seating outside so hang out for awhile.  Do expect to wait a bit for your food as it is being prepared to order."}
{"text":"Un endroit qui réunit à la fois mon côté végétalien et carnivore.  Le sandwich halloumi/salade de chou/menthe,/mayonnaise au chipotle/miel m'a fait craquer. J'ai aussi craqué pour. l'VPP (végétarien pulled pork) sandwich. J'aime bien le café ici est incroyable L'été, il faut absolument goûter au \"Powermade\" une bière maison de thé glacé composée approximativement d'hibiscus, de cannelle et de citron"}
{"text":"If your friends haven't brought you here already are they really friends at all? This secret little sandwich shop is hardly a secret anymore and not entirely a sandwich shop. Come for the amazing veggie pulled pork sandwich, stay because you realize there are lots of other delicious foods available here!"}
{"text":"A fantastic local spot in Montreal. Whether you're vegetarian or not, the faux BBQ sandwich is outstanding, and the \"tunathon\" is the best tuna sandwich I've ever eaten. The cookies are also fantastic. Cool setup, great people, great food. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Great rad diner with vegan and vegetarian options. The fake pulled pork sandwich is my favorite. Awesome old school diner breakfasts with some zines on the side. Nice patio during summer. A real Mile Ex staple."}
{"text":"Awesome food from a converted retro dep hidden away in a quiet side street near Little Italy. Vegetarian pulled pork sandwich is sublime. Staff are super friendly and interesting."}
{"text":"On my first day in Montreal, having done my research, I dragged my resident friend to Le Pick Up.  Oh. My. Goodness. Admittedly, I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and as such have never eaten pulled pork before. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to taste like, but if it tastes anything like the incredible faux pulled porc I had here, then I certainly understand the hype. It was so sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. Amazing flavours and perfect crusty bread at a good price. Not to mention, babely eye candy behind the counter taking your order and serving up the goods. The tables outside are a lovely addition to this kitschy neighbourhood deps.  I will definitely be back here before my trip to Montreal is over."}
{"text":"Love it. This is a depanneur in the mile ex area that doubles up as a restaurant but I think most people come for the food. I've ordered from both their breakfast and lunch menus. Never been disappointed. Service is always excellent and unassuming. As for the food, I love their beef burgers, chipotle club, potatoes and quinoa salad. There is a daily menu that varies from day to day. They also have amazing lattes and desserts. This place tends to get busy during meal times so be prepared to wait or to order for takeout."}
{"text":"Go with a friend. Split the veggie pulled pork sandwich (VPP) and the halloumi sandwich, so you can try both and throw in a side of potatoes.   All their baked goods on display at the counter are delicious. I wouldn't know - I've never eaten them. Just saw \"someone else\" eat a lemon square one time and then a chocolate chip cookie another time, and look super happy with life. I am pretty sure it was \"someone else\".  Consistently delicious. Casual vibe (it's part of a dep) and off the beaten path - full of local Montrealers. It has a small seating area (maybe 3 tables) and the bar inside, and in the summer there are picnic benches outside. Close to the Jean Talon market if you're in the hood.  This is one of those places I hope never changes."}
{"text":"Excellent petit endroit qu'il faut absolument connaître! C'est le genre de place qu'on découvre par bouche à oreille, car il est dans un bout de quartier un peu moins fréquenté (Mile Ex).   Leurs sandwichs au pulled pork font leur réputation, mais les autres sortes sont également excellentes. Le sandwich au poisson (pas toujours au menu) est fantastique!  Si vous y aller en semaine le midi, surtout le jeudi et le vendredi, attendez-vous à patienter un petit bout en ligne. Le Pick-Up est vraiment populaire, surtout auprès des bureaux d'architectes et de web voisins!   Si vous habitez le quartier, le Pick-Up est un excellent endroit où aller déjeuner rapidos, assis au \" bar \" à regarder le cook travailler. Leurs déjeuners sont simples mais bons.   Il ne faut pas oublier non plus que c'est un dépanneur, donc ils vendent bières, cigarettes et un peu de bouffe pour dépanner. Et ils ont une excellente sélection de zines!  Seul hic... Il ne prenne pas la carte, ce qui est vraiment dommage!"}
{"text":"Un petit endroit qui n'a pas d'allure, mais qui est super bon, les gens sont accueillants. Rien à redire"}
{"text":"Vegan bf came here to try out the faux pulled pork sandwich. He had to ask them to remake it to vegan without the mayo sauce since it had eggs.   Looked amazing and huge portion but the cabbage was overpowering in vinegar. The faux pork was very good in flavour and had a lot of bbq sauce. There was nothing else to it though.. not worth the $9 to it.   Overall, cute shop, hippie ambiance, good flavour of the meat but not the other ingredients and no sides considering how much you pay."}
{"text":"Overall I'd say this place is a-ok, but its atmosphere and non-food offerings make it quirky and definitely enjoyable! It seems to be a local lunchtime favorite as nearly all of the tables were full. Luckily, I managed to grab a window seat while waiting for my food to come out.  I ordered a cappuccino and the pulled pork sandwich. The cappuccino was perfect and came in this beautiful red cup that I really wanted to steal and take back to put in my own apartment. The flavors were bold and strong but not too overpowering or acidic, and it went down so smoothly. I thought the pulled pork sandwich was just okay and nothing too special. Maybe it was a bit too sweet for my taste, as I like my pulled pork to be focused more on the natural flavors of the meat.  After eating, I browsed their shelves which held some relics related to all things arts and culture, and I picked up a zine for $2.50 which detailed why you should start a band. I thought it was lovely that the authors decided to address specifically queer and POC female participation in a typically sexist band culture and why it's important to have them represented. It was also funny and carried a sense of honesty that can't be forced. I'll come back to explore their selection of SXSW and other music festival-related goodies next time!"}
{"text":"Franchement délicieux et le service est génial."}
{"text":"Tried the burger, steak sous marine & pulled pork!!! All very delicious. Cookies are to die for"}
{"text":"OMG, heaven in earth !  Quelle bonne idée d'être venu ici avant d'aller voir du tennis au parc Jarry. La bouffe est trop bonne et je me suis fait péter le bide pour passer tranquillement l'après midi :) Mon club sandwich était tellement bon avec le poulet mariné, la sauce relevée, etc ... Les patates commandées en plus étaient bien cuites et fondantes, assaisonnées parfaitement. J'ai goûté le burger végé et c'était vraiment bon, au top des burgers végé que j'ai pu goûter ! Concernant les desserts nous avons pris les pâtisseries vendus et c'était vraiment bon. Les biscuits et le carré au citron étaient parfaits pour finir le repas ! Au final on s'en est tiré pour 35$ à 2 (tx et tips) et on a très bien mangé, que cela soit d'un point de vue qualitatif ou quantitatif.  Une expérience à renouveler très rapidement pour tester les autres plats dont le sous marin au boeuf qui me faisait sérieusement de l'oeil !"}
{"text":"Normally I write a lot but there is nothing to say about this one! Simply delicious, top 10 spots in my neiberhood! The club chipotle is my thing over there! so good!"}
{"text":"Heureuse d'avoir découvert Le Pick-Up... Enfin!! Un mardi après midi où il faisait vraiment beau nous avons entrepris une belle marche au soleil et, mon amie qui connaissait la place nous a recommandé le burger végétarien de \"pull pork\" fait avec de la peau de tofu: Yuba. Bonus, celui-ci peut aussi être commandé vegan!  Étant toujours un peu sceptique sur certains mets avec du tofu (j'aime généralement pas ça) j'ai opté pour un cheeseburger standard, mais vraiment délicieux, juteux et dans un bon petit pain! Très satisfaite de ma commande, j'ai quand même pu goûter au fameux sandwich de faux pull pork et ... wow!!! C'est réellement bon! Même si je n'habite pas près de la place, je me suis promis d'y retourner très bientôt pour en manger un au complet d'ici la fin de l'été pour en plus profiter de la charmante terrasse!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say thank you for having a booth set up at Osheaga. A place where apparently not eating meat is the hugest imposition ever.  I couldnt do another pizza cone or overpiced dagwood sandwich by the third day and you guys saved me. The vegetarian pulled pork was my first time trying fake pulled pork but it was great. I dug the extra stringy/chewy texture since most fake meat isn't as \"hearty.\" The bun and dressings also added a nice presentation to it. It felt like I was eating a super manly and substantial sandwich, which is not often something you get when ordering vegetarian sandwiches. (see: every place that has a \"vegetarian\" option which means scattered un-seasoned roasted vegetables on a piece of bread.)"}
{"text":"Best place in the world. The food is ridiculous. Unique and delicious.  If you like sweets get the lemon square There's a super cute terrasse out back Although tables are a little hard to come by as it gets pretty busy Staff is great, food is great, definitely one of my favourite spots to eat"}
{"text":"Years later and still one of my favourite spots in the city. This is our neighbourhood love. It's chill and delicious. It's like a crusty old dep with a heart of gold - sweet young punk servers and chefs selling some of my favourite food plus good beers and organic groceries and other corner store things, plus local art and good zines.   We can't walk nearby without going cross-eyed craving the veggie pulled pork like it's Pavlovian. Also love the classic breakfast sandwich, the grilled halloumi and pretty much whatever is on special.   The owners are badass humans who have gone on to partner with their friends and employees in bringing more dreamspaces into being in Montreal, like Alexandraplatz and Cafe dei Campi.   I am, in every way, a fan."}
{"text":"I randomly bixied by Dépanneur le Pick-Up when I was cruising around the area but for some reason didn't stop to check it out. Lucky, I was back in the Mile Ex area a few days later and stopped this time to check it out. It's location is somewhat hidden in a quiet residential area.  Hours are decent. Weekdays are 7:00am - 7:00pm and Saturday 9:00am - 6:00pm.  Nothing like grafitti on your sign to give it a cool grunge look. Candice wuz hee.  Love the old school diner menu. It's almost a throwback to back in the day diner prices. Couple drink options. Cool that there's also a little grocery market inside.Their pastries looked pretty decadent, especially that lemon square.  Matching diner booths and decor to solidify the old school look. Ventured outside while I waited for my grilled sandwich to be made. Love how there's two-seaters to sit at right along the sidewalk. Only in Montreal.  - Haloum grillé ($8.00) - grilled haloumi with mint coleslaw. Everything is made to order here and you can tell. The sandwich was bomb. Best vegetarian sandwich I've had. Bread was grilled perfect; crispy, golden, buttery goodness.  A huge slab of haloumi cheese awaits inside. The texture of haloumi is satisfying and grilling it made it even more so. The inside is packed with ingredients; red and white cabbage, carrots, onion but the game changer here was the mint. Gave it such a refreshingly cool after taste.  This is the spot if you want a cheap, delicious made to order grilled sandwich. A depanneur and diner all in one combo."}
{"text":"Super petite place de quartier. La bouffe est bonne et très conviviale. J'ai pris le sandwich au pulled pork végé ( oui, oui!) et c'était vraiment délicieux! On y trouve de charmants produits locaux comme les conserves de Preservation Society et d'autres produits plus funky comme de la boisson au Kombucha ou de la sauce piquante! J'aime leurs tables à pique-nique extérieurs où l'on peut relaxer sans soucis au soleil! Chouette Dép!"}
{"text":"Ici chaque plat à une saveur bien à lui. Ne pas oublier de goûter au sandwich de porc effiloché. C'est également le point de rencontre de tous les hipsters de la ville semble-t-il. Les prix sont raisonnables le décor est nul mais on peut y manger à l'extérieur"}
{"text":"Les sandwichs sont vraiment bons. On ne s'attend pas a manger de telles choses dans un dépanneur sans prétention du Mile-End.  L'attente a été très longue malheureusement. Cela ne m'a pas donné envie d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Delish delish delish! Have tried just about everything from sandwichs, salad and potatoes to desserts! Fresh and never boring! Friendly staff and due to popularity be patient as worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My mechanic suggests I wait the hour at \"a cool dep/café down the street\". Dubious about what \"cool\" means to him....  Well Hello Dolly!!!  Hello Twilight Zone Pit-stop Heaven!  Vintage dépanneur with diner counter & sweet terrace. Understated, wholesome neighbourhood secret sweet spot. Good people, doing good things, in a great way."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of the \"cool\" of Montreal this famous sandwich joint is a absolutely must try. I'm not into trying things for name sake, but this place really does thing right. The vibe they own, it's not fake and the food really is amazing and fits perfectly. This is real Montreal. I have had a few diffrent things from drinks to sanwiches and dessert and everytime I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Le Pick-Up un dépanneur? Oui, on peut dire ça. Un snack-bar? On peut dire ça aussi. Quoi d'autre? Un repère à hipster? Un endroit atypique? Un restaurant inclassable? Une cuisine surprenante? Oui.. on peut dire tout ça aussi du dépanneur le Pick-Up.   Il s'agit donc d'un comptoir restaurant situé à l'intérieur d'un bon vieux dépanneur de quartier. Si le concept peut surprendre, on oublie souvent que ce drôle de mélange était très courant dans les quartiers ouvriers des grandes villes du Québec. On y venait pour casser la croute à midi, et pour y faire ses courses à fin du \"shift\" de travail. C'est donc ce concept rétro qui est conservé ici dans toute sa simplicité.   En gros, je dirais que la cuisine du Pick-up est surprenante et inventive. J'ai mangé un sandwich au fromage haloum grillé avec salade de choux. Très bon. On dit de l'endroit que la spécialité est le sandwich Pulled-Pork, alors je me promets d'y revenir pour y gouter. Un dernier mot sur l'ambiance atypique. Lors de mon passage ici, un groupe électro-underground jouait en sourdine, ce qui ajoutait à l'atmosphère très hipster de l'endroit. J'adore.   À visiter absolument."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a warm place to sit and have a nice link here, they serve brunch also. I always take the pulled pork sandwich. They serve up some pretty decent burgers and subs also.  I have this a high grade because of the people that work there.. Very friendly. They strive to make you feel welcome.  I actually can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian, this place is a good choice -- cheap but excellent veggie burgers with all the same toppings as the meat ones! It's like a tiny diner, with music & decor to match."}
{"text":"This place is a neighbourhood staple. Do yourself a favour and eat the veggie pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"J'adore cette place !  Un peu planqué mais il vaut le détour. Le Pick-Up est placé dangereusement sur mon chemin pour aller au marché Jean Talon. Les sandwichs sont bons et l'ambiance est bonne.  C'est simple et efficace."}
{"text":"Il faut sortir des sentiers battus pour se rendre au Pick-Up... et, puis, attention : on cligne des yeux et hop!, on passe devant ; ni vu, ni connu.   Alors ma recommandation : gardez les yeux ouverts !    Le Pick-Up est un charmant petit resto, café ET dépanneur... un genre d'enfant illégitime (mais ô combien adorable !) résultant d'un ménage à trois entre un diner, un truck-stop et une quincaillerie de quartier.  On y trouve de tout ; du petit paquet de serviettes hygiéniques, aux lettres et numéros adhésifs à apposer sur sa porte d'entrée, en passant par le carton de jus d'orange, et sans oublier le sandwich au fromage haloum grillé !  Génial petit endroit sans prétention, bien sympa et chaleureux.  On y va pour se dépanner, pour emporter, pour y luncher ou pour y prendre un café avec sa p'tite gang... ou on opte pour la livraison à la maison.  J'ai découvert cet endroit - un premier étage de duplex dans le Mile-Ex, au coin de Waverly et Beaumont - grâce à des amis il y a presque un an maintenant et j'y retourne régulièrement pour manger un bon sandwich au comptoir ou assise à une des deux tables à l'intérieur.    Certains raffolent de leurs petits déjeuners et de leurs petits gâteaux...  Je ne les ai encore jamais essayés."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is awesome. I've tried a couple of pulled pork sandwiches all over the US and surprisingly, this place takes the cake. Well balanced with pickles, mayo, pickled banana peppers and cole slaw...crunchy yet airy bread...It was great. The Pick-Up also sells a small variety of ginger beers, which was a big plus for me / a wonderful surprise. If you're in this neighborhood, you MUST try it out. Plus this place is a stone's throw from Jean Talon market, I recommend visiting both in a single outing.  Price: $7.50"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious... Really delicious! Beware, the crowds are very eclectic... Beyond your usual hipster. Nice vibe and super friendly service. Parking is a little difficult. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As long as you don't mind feeling like the hipster you know you are, dear Yelp reader, this place is awesome.   We were staying in the old town and Ubered out to this place for lunch because we had heard good things. It was well worth it. Awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome hallumi sandwich, awesome lemonade and pleasant seats outside.   Lots of talk at the table next to us about getting some \"studio time\" to \"lay down some tracks\", so in addition to having really good sandwiches, Le Pickup must also be really cool.  PS, there's a bike station right next to the shop."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. I got the veggie pulled 'porc' and my friend got the sous-marin steak sub. Both of the sandwiches were super delicious. The pulled porc sandwich was sweet, tangy, spicy and oh so good! The steak sub looked really good too. Liked the ambiance and enjoyed watching the chef serve up sandwiches as we ate"}
{"text":"It's rare, but every once in a while, I encounter an edible that puts me into what I like to call a food fugue. Yesterday, Le Pick-Up allowed for this altered state of reality with its life-changing vegan pulled pork sandwich. I believe I held conversations while eating, but I don't remember a single word of them. I can't even tell you where I was at any point while devouring this masterful ensemble of yuba bits slathered in BBQ, topped with slaw, hot pickled peppers and pickles. Hot sauce. Hot sauce was involved and made a wondrous thing even more wondrous.   That's really all I can write about in this review because the deliciousness eclipses just about every other detail... well, except for the fact that the staff is the sweetest and the deceptively humble environs is endearing to regulars and new customers alike. You'd never expect to encounter a life changing sandwich here so that makes me love Le Pick-Up even more!  I'm, as we speak, making plans to return to Montreal in a couple months so that I can have daily access to this sandwich. My days will revolve around eating this sandwich. I cannot imagine ever being the same again if I can't have this sandwich."}

{"text":"Hells yes to the faux pulled pork sandwich! The only real issue with being a vegetarian is that I always feel left out while my friends have a big meaty paw of a sandwich and I am stuck with what looks like cat food from a tin can smooshed between two lame pieces of bread. Thanks to Le Pick-Up, I too can now have a huge 'meaty' sandwich in my paw! The chipotle mayo and banana peppers provided a nice kick and the bread was perfection: toasted and delicious. My meat-eating lunch mate couldn't get over the texture of the tofu, said it was exactly like real porc. The staff here are friendly and fun, the tunes were cranked and we scored a picnic table right by the door. I love this place! Bonus: the cookies and lemon bars are divine and they have a huge range of condoms available...why? Who knows, but hey, you can never be too careful!"}

{"text":"Wonderful.  I was enchanted at once the first time I walked in here upon sight of the inexplicable gigantic toothbrush.  This is in fact a depanneur, but they have a sweet little kitchen to pump out delicious meaty (or not) savory meals.  Upon sampling every sandwich on the menu (not in the first visit) I'd have to say that the winner is a tie between the Club Chipotle (club sandwich with chipotle sauce) and the Post-Reveillon (turkey and cranberry!).  Of the two times I had the pulled pork, it unfortunately varied.  My first was not nearly moist and flavorful as it should have been, yet the second time (when Beaver was in the kitchen) it was deeeelicious and perfect.  My plate was a mess and I licked it clean.  In public.  I have as of yet to try the soups nor the salads, but I surely will sometime soon.  A solid place for cheap and filling eats to show your out of town friends a little slice of Trouvé-seulement-à-Montréal\" dining or just to meet up with local friends for a delightful bite.  Nice and hidden so the dummies from McGill can't find it as it's located outside of the McGill \"Ghetto.\""}
{"text":"FAUX PULLED PORK SANDWICH: The bun/bread is good, as are the slaw and pickles. I actually haven't had a pulled pork sandwich since becoming vegan or vegetarian and I'm not sure when the last time I had one when I did eat meat, so although it's been years, I honestly was so surprised by the quality of the faux meat! It's definitely a personal choice, but I'd rather eat just veggies than spongey/tasteless meat alternatives.  Note: Order without mayo if vegan. I'm vegan and it's still Very good. Well, I didn't think it was missing the mayo because the BBQ sauce is good. Can't remember the price exactly but it was about $8CAD. And the sandwich was pretty big, I saved half for my next meal!  COFFEE/ESPRESSO: I've gotten coffee and espresso here on many separate occasions, and they were always really good. I heard that a couple of the people there work at those high end, chemist-style coffee places, which I know doesn't necessarily mean it's good here but it's a fun fact anyway.  Again, don't remember the price but it's like normal not over priced, about $2CAD per drink.   THE PLACE: It's still a depanneur, so definitely expect that sort of place. There's seating at the counter right where you pay but there's also a bunch of tables out back. It's super casual but don't let that trick you into thinking all depanneur's have as good as food - they don't. This is quite literally a diamond in the rough (well, not literally obviously).  Sidenote: The desserts look amazing (different cookies and pastries, etc.). I haven't tried any because they probably all contain eggs or dairy, but I've seen many a people gush over the chocolate chip cookies and this vanilla pastry that they have. Try one for me."}
