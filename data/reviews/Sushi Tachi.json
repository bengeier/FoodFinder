{"text":"The sushi was awesome we tried the Philadelphia, Rainbow, flying Jason, and black jack roll. All were great. The only reason they got a three is halfway through all of the waiters in the entire restaurant disappeared for 15 minutes. The sushi chef finally called them after we looked around several times. Also the waitress was very rushed and pushy when taking/waiting for your order but then never comes back. Go for good sushi, not service."}
{"text":"This has been my #1 pick sushi spot since I moved to vegas from LA!! Hard to compare to the sushi places back home, but this one is great! Staff is great n the food is just amaze-balls!! The atmosphere is family friendly and fun! My favorite is the volcano roll & baked mussels! The only thing I wish they would add to their menu is green tea tempura ice cream!! Every sushi bar I've been to serves it except this one!! Hopefully they will add it soon.. Other than that no question about it.. If you're a local n love sushi this place is for you!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi offers an All You Can Eat menu at a reasonable price.  I was there on 3/16/12. The food was great, the service was superior and the staff was friendly and prompt.  I plan on dining there again very soon"}
{"text":"I don't know that much about sushi but the group I was with does.  Remarks from the crowd, \"top notch\", \"the waiter knows whats up\", \"great presentation\", \"best value in town\".  That says it all.  The only thing missing for me was more atmosphere.  It felt a little like I may as well have been sitting in a doctor's office.  Overall it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"10-4-2013 1700 (5pm) Friday 8 people in the restaurant. Was placed at a table and immediately noticed the table was filthy, look around and others in the same shape. Not dishes, food residue on the table. Ask busboy to clean uses a very wet cloth a couple of swipes and leaves the table wet. Mad because he had to do his job. Ordered Calamari fish was not cooked. Ordered sashimi dinner salmon was very old tried to cover it up with lemon slices. While I was eating the chef started some fish in the salamander about two minutes, then was told wrong order so he pulled out laid it on the back counter. A little later chef put it back in salamander and served it to someone else. There is food on walls, food on chairs, fish not stored at proper temperatures. Pre made starters wrapped in Saran Wrap about ten out in the open on the back of counter. I was up half the night with bowl problems.  The worst thing about this experience, I have been going there since it opened. This OWNER takes, but doesn't put anything back into the business. It is very popular, but someone is going to get very sick. City and county FOOD inspectors  need to come inspect now."}
{"text":"On point customer service the food is good ! Nice environment.  Highly recommend if you don't feel like going to the strip and spending stupid amounts of money.  Plus side is all you can drink sake n bud light"}
{"text":"The head chef left.  Sushi & service suffers terribly."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The staff is friendly and their food is very good. I choose not to do AYCE sushi because of the short time limit and I'd have to eat waaay too much to get my monies worth (possibly a good thing for some)."}
{"text":"I thought I would never find better AYCE sushi than in Reno, NV, but after making the move back to Las Vegas (okay NLV) I was stoked to discover Sushi Tachi. For being desert style sushi, it is delicious and the service their could not be better. I can expect to find a friendly smile and some seriously good sushi. My friends will even venture from their west side to join us here!"}
{"text":"Customer Service: Great! Young lady was very courteous and attentive.  Atmosphere and decor: Staff should wipe the menu down. Just because they're laminated does not mean it's disinfected. Decor was modern and clean. There was a funny egg smell when we first walked in.   Food: -Shoyu Ramen was salty and took 20 mins -Fried calamari tasted like old crunchy grease -Curry bowl was great -Veggie roll was decent  Will not be coming back. Go to sushi house Goyemon instead."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The atmosphere is very welcoming and servers are super friendly! The fish was very fresh, loved the seared salmon. You can order half rolls too, so you're able to try more. Definitely recommend the all you can eat because they have a variety of different rolls that are a must try like the Moon River Roll :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi is a great place, they are my favorite place not only for sushi, but my favorite restaurant in general. They are also a great value $26 for all you can eat for dinner plus $2 for a drink including refills, I always eat a ton, their sushi is delicious.  I've been to other sushi places that have similar offers around Las Vegas, but their sushi isn't as good as the sushi you get at Sushi Tachi. Something else I would add is that when you're in a group you can share only if you all order all you can eat.   When I arrived at the parking lot I heard Katy Perry playing, they have speakers that play music outside of their restaurant, I found this welcoming. At the front I was greeted and quickly seated with a party I was meeting, a waiter asked me for my drink and brought it to me very quickly. A waitress then took my order, I started off with Uni, I found it pleasing, it tastes a bit like oyster, but pasty instead of slimy in case you've never had it before. After I ate my Uni, I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll, it has hot tempura shrimp next to cream cheese on the inside which warms it up, which is then complimented with the cold, sticky, sweet sushi rice on the outside, dip it in soy sauce to add that extra salty element that dances on your taste buds. I also tried something new, I didn't know what it was at first, a friend of mine ordered it. It turns out it was the New York Girl in Vegas, it was amazing. As I chewed into it, I felt the sticky, the firm salmon, the creamy avocado and the creamy and spicy mayo. I swallowed and something hit me, something citrusy, I was caught off guard, it adds a lot of bright notes to the roll, I loved it and will order it next time I go.  I love this place overall, one complaint would be that I wish the waitress would walk by more often so that we could order more food, the food can also take a while to all come out, but it's worth the wait. I strongly recommend checking this place out if you haven't. Try the Lisa Lisa roll, the Tachi #2, a lot of my friends favorite, and the New York Girl you'll love them."}
{"text":"Well, several months ago my rating would have been much higher, but the last time we went, the service was much slower and the sushi not as good.  We do like the AYCE days, and we take advantage of it.  Even with slow service, it is worth it, because we EAT SUSHI - a lot of it, and everything on their menu, even the $15 special rolls are included with the AYCE.  We usually go on the days when it includes wine or beer, and it is definitely worth the price.  We are traditionalists and therefore don't usually eat the Americanized cream cheese and avocado stuffed rolls, and it's harder to ruin the standard fish and rice sushi.  But some of the rolls being served are gorgeous.  All the cooked things I have had, yakitori, hamachi kama, etc. have been very good!  I have to say that every time we have been there, the fish has been fresh, but the care going into it and the little touches (like making it pretty) just haven't been there.  They don't use wasabi in their sushi either, which is strange.  I guess I could ask them to do, but we just put it into our soy sauce and dip the sushi in it.  Needless to say, we will be going back."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at sushi tachi    The customer service here is wonderful! I didn't catch our servers name, but my receipt says her name is 0001? Lol She makes funny little jokes, which makes me want to come back. The service was fast even though the entire place was packed. Only one table open.  All in all this place was great! It's the third time I've been here and its still good. Oh and don't forget your frequent buyer card!"}
{"text":"I will have a spicy tuna roll with a side of racism. My family and I went to Sushi Tachi a few months ago and it has taken me this long to calm the rage from the experience to write my review.  One evening my husband,  daughter and I went out to AYCE at Sushi Tachi. We walked in, sat down and began ordering. My daughter had brought in a Disney Princess doll to keep her occupied. Dinner went on and we were getting odd service from one of the waitresses. My husband and I simply thought she was just a naturally unhappy person and that is simply \"how her face always looked.\"  The odd unhappy waitress came over at one point and asked my daughter to see her doll. The waitress said, \"that is a pretty doll, is it Cinderella? .\" My daughter corrected her and said, \"no it is Sophia the First.\" The waitresses response, \"oh, well she is white just like every Disney Princess.\" She then walked away from the table. My husband and I looked at each other in shock. We finally arrived at dessert. I ordered green tea ice cream and my husband ordered a tempura vanilla ice cream. When the waitress brought our order she gave me my green tea ice cream and as she placed my husband's order down she said and I quote, \"here is your vanilla, vanilla.\" My husband a little confused asked her what she said. The odd, unhappy, smug waitress repeated, \"here is your vanilla, VANILLA!\"  Well, as you can imagine we will never be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever. Staff is great & food is fresh & exceptional. I would highly recommend this place to everyone that loves good sushi!!!!!  Yummy, yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, teriyaki and chicken bowl were greasy but the worst part was the service. We only saw our servers when they brought our food. We repeatedly had to try and flag them down for refills or napkins. It eventually got to the point where we had to get up and find them everytime we needed something. After we ate, we waited at least twenty minutes for them to bring our check.  I'd give this place one star if it weren't for the sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go the staff is always the best and it never takes long to get our sushi... the HAWAIIAN ROLL & STACY ROLL are the best"}
{"text":"This place was great, sushi was top notch, service was even better. For being from out of town, I had no idea what to expect but was very happy."}
{"text":"Love it best Sushi in Vegas sexy girl my favorite roll Sukura followed right behind baked green muscles 5 star great costumer service. Top 5 places to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for your little around the corner neighborhood sushi spot. Been here more than a few times. Good for something quick, but I've had better. Great service though. Can get pretty slammed with families and babies... it is a neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, service,  and atmosphere! Love their tuna lovers roll and the monthly special roll."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in North Las Vegas. It's a God-send. I have always received top-notch service and it never ceases to satisfy my sushi cravings.   My only critique is they don't seem to have spent as much attention on the decor as they have their wonderful service and tasty food. It's just not much to look at, that's all.  \"All you can eat\" prices are fair--$26 for lunch and $29 for dinner and that includes all the Bud Light and sake you can drink. I've run up on the time limit and the staff was very polite by letting me know I'm getting close and they would take any additional orders I had cause they didn't want to charge me extra.  I've had the AYCE at least a dozen times here and I've never had anything I didn't like. Easily worth driving even 15 minutes for!"}
{"text":"Great, really. Good service, even better prices--great sushi. Try the rock and roll, and fried Philadelphia roll. Awesome."}
{"text":"When I was out in the Las Vegas area I used to go to this sushi bar quite often. One of the benefits of eating here was the made-to-order, all you can eat sushi specials during lunch time. I wonder if they still have this going but if you were looking for a cheap sushi meal, then go no further. However, I've definitely had better sushi in my life before (I've been to Japan twice, and there is a great sushi bar in Kansas City, MO which is excellent.)"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood sushi place. Nothing special; it's gets the job done.  Warning: the 911 roll is CRAZY hot. Seriously spicy."}
{"text":"This is probably the best value sushi you will find.  It's definitely not Nobu but the quality is good and the price is great.  The all-you-can-eat special is fantastic.  I don't know how they make money off of it."}
{"text":"The continuous quest for decent sushi in the desert brought me here.  Located on the SE corner of Simmons and Centennial, the location is convenient for me, so I just had to try it.  Sushi Tachi has the standard tonkatsu, teriyaki, tempura, sushi, and udon.  They also have an AYCE menu, for $25.95 for 1 hour.  I am very skeptical of AYCE sushi, but surprisingly this place is a solid 3.5 stars!  The sumeshi was on the mushy side, maybe they put a little too much water in the rice cooker today.  But, the portions were surprisingly generous, especially for AYCE!  (I was expecting monsterous-sized nigiri, topped with a wafer-thin slice of fish.)  Our waitress was Thai and a little slow, but one of the Japanese waitresses took our second round order, when I jokingly said I wanted uni and amaebi (the limited sushi menu did not list these items), she asked the Japanese sushi chef if they had uni and amaebi, and he responded with a, \"Hai! Motteru!\" Wow. I asked if they had otoro, and the sushi chef said, \"mottenai\".  Too bad, I guess you can't win them all!  She then asked if we wanted the amaebi heads fried...I jokingly looked at her like, \"duh!\" and she laughed and wrote my order down LOL. Yay!  Now I knew I was going to get my money's worth!  This place is actually not bad for the price, much better than Sushi Wow on Simmons and Ann.  They do, however limit the uni, amaebi, sake shooter, and fried oyster to one order per customer.  (I guess that's fair, because people like me will just place an order for 20 Uni sushis LOL)  They also have a stamper card, so when you buy 10 AYCE meals, the 11th one is free!  I will definitely be coming back when I feel like pigging out!  Update 5/15: I have been going to Sushi Tachi pretty regularly, and this place still is a solid 3.5 stars in my book!  They didn't have Uni the last time I was there, but they had toro and kobe beef!  Yum!  Don't mind the cheezy 80's rock music they play there LOL!"}
{"text":"Service: Horrible.   Ordered our dishes. We saw our dishes ready. Waiteress left her shift,  out the door she went without saying anything to us. Maybe they speak no English?!?  and didn't even give us our sushi.   Waited around. Called another worker over and we asked him to give us our sushi that's 2 feet away. I guess he became our waiter. The hubby asked for ice cream. It never came. Had to ask again. Note-there was barely anybody there.   FOOD: Meh. Not as flavorful sushi as the ones I've had in San Diego. The 'finish-every-grain-of-rice-else-you're-buying-the-whole-roll' is quite intimidating. They try to get you full off their rice so you want to order more cause your full of rice!  The mussels and seared fish were good.   Mochi for dessert is awesome except you only get ONE even though it's an AYCE. Lame.     They lag and suck at customer service(waiters that is). Quality mediocre.  No thanks for $60 between us."}
{"text":"Friendly service. nice little sushi place. Maybe some more tvs, & some good music to liven up the atmosphere a little. Need a little more all you can eat options, I went through them all already."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch off times now. Consistently provided good food and great service. Even when they are very busy."}
{"text":"I like the rolls it's super yummy! I think the coolest part is I came down on a Tuesday and they were doing all-you-can-drink beer and sake in addition to their AYCE sushi. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The go-to all you can sushi place in Vegas.  After my husband introduced me to this place, I've been a fan ever since.    For a while we would double date with another couple and the sushi chef started recognizing us and would send over off the menu creations that were delish!  Everyone who works here is really nice.    If you go on certain days of the week it's all you can eat sushi and also all you can drink beer or sake."}
{"text":"We usually go to Sushi Tachi on Wednesdays to enjoy the all you can eat and all you can drink. Our favorites are Gone with the Wind and Haru!"}
{"text":"i didnt like it at all.. i read some of the reviews and they were all saying its good but when i went it was so expensive and the food wasnt all that great. ive been to a better all you can eat sushi place before and they were way cheaper and had more variety. the lunch was 25 and the other place i went to lunch was 15 and had oysters and raw food. this place doesnt give u oysters till dinner. the other place is sushi kaya try there is better and worth the drive. its off spring mountain and arville."}
{"text":"I have to say that this AYCE sushi restaurant is sublime! I literally stuffed myself until I could not continue to eat. This is something that I don't get to do often so it is a very satisfying feeling knowing that I can fill my belly!  It's always a treat being able to go to a place that is all you can eat; however, when you think of it...quality doesn't come to mind. I usually go to all you can eat sushi restaurants with lower expectations but this place is definitely an exception! Delicious! The sushi is fresh and the quality is definitely not what I expected!   I don't really enjoy Vegas but I will definitely be stopping by here again  if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot tucked away in the south east corner, next to EOS gym. Have a carb load after leg day :) Staff are kind and the sushi chefs are fast. I've had their All You Can Eat, which is a great selection. Wish they had a steak sushi though. I've also ordered out and they were fast with my order. Definitely my go to sushi spot on the north side of town."}
{"text":"Great service, very nice employees and the Sushi Rocks! You don't have to order from the menu only they will customize your rolls the way you like without attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place! it's only 5 min. away from my house. My husband and I always go here we have been going here for about 4 years now lol. I love the sushi ALL YOU CAN EAT they say it's 60 min. but I know I've been there longer.They do half rolls if you are too full to eat a whole one. We usually bring my daughter and she's allergic to fish so it is a good think they have things other than fish on their menu. The staff is super nice and very helpful. Our cups are never empty when ever we come here.me and my family are usually there like 3 times a month.Plus they added my favorite dessert TEMPURA ICE cream they only have one flavor Vanilla."}
{"text":"I love this  place!! Come here every time we crave sushi. I can never complain!!  fresh good quality food"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't bad (though I didn't think there was variety like I've seen other places), better than expected but the service was lacking. No one offered to fill my water until after we got our bill. We had to sit at the bar cause they were so busy and the sushi chef wasn't personable. He made no eye contact whatsoever and we ordered a roll he mumbled a response and we weren't sure he even got it right. I probably won't go again but if you need a quick fix and don't want to drive far give it a shot."}
{"text":"Hole in a wall place I found near my house.  Brought my family here that was visiting from Alaska and they loved it!  Everyone is nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. So, of course, I'm going to go for my last week in Vegas. My advice is not to sit at the bar on a weekend. It was hard to order food as they were constantly busy. The food was great as always. My favorite us the super white."}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi in this area. We love their cajun tuna. My family has always had good luck with the freshest fish."}
{"text":"I'm came back what's up  Hungry eat 4roll I'm full so good Thanks guys see you soon"}
{"text":"Harold is gone.  We won't be back.  He did all the ordering and now I am no longer confident that the fish will be the same quality.  You have all been warned.  I was told someone got sick off the salmon this week after Chef Haru was gone.  It also would not be the same without him serving my sushi."}
{"text":"We used to eat here a lot over the course of 4 years. But slowly the quality of food and service had deteriorated. We waited too long to get our food, come to find out our sever forgot our order. Since we had ordered AYCE we have plates piling up. We have stacked our plates on one side of the table so it will be easier for the server to clear it. But, they didn't even bother to pick it up. The only thing that we got fast was when we asked for the check. Definitely...you guys lost our business. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Our party of seven went for the all-you-can-eat lunch on a recent Saturday.  For some reason, we weren't feeling much love from the staff, even though we were the only ones seated at the theretofore empty counter/bar and the tables were only half filled.  Believe me, we're definitely not a bunch of jerks that might elicit such a reception, which maybe means we tend to be a bit too sensitive about such things as attentive, friendly service.  But it's also a bit ironic that the all-Japanese staff should also know that they wouldn't be forgiven for such shabby service, say, in Tokyo.  The young sushi chef who was serving us for some reason seemed to be in an especially unpleasant mood--almost as if he was doing us a big favor by taking our orders (Itamaesan no taido wa mazukatta!).  Nonetheless, the sushi itself was not half bad.  Perhaps for many people food quality mitigates poor service but I have to question whether it was worth driving up to the edge of nowhere for such a chilly reception, especially when you've already traveled 2,800 miles to Vegas from Honolulu!  A bit disappointing as this was our second visit with more or less the same group and we had been looking forward to dining there based on our initial, more positive experience at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. For a sushi restaurant, rice will make or break your business and the rice here is impeccable. Just the right amount of bite without being soggy. Great food."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend after reading all the nice reviews here on Yelp. I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect some level of tasty sushi expectation. Wanting to satisfy our sushi cravings and for a close to home spot to eat it, we ventured out to this little place on a Friday night around 7pm. Unfortunately, yelpers totally missed the mark this time. Don't worry I still rely on and like you fellow yelpers.   Service was good. They were attentive for when my glass was  empty and refilled it quickly. Clean and spacious place. Even had a TV mounted on the wall. Normally I'm used to the loud, crowded, sometimes chaotic sushi joints where the bar is filled up and everyone's having a good time. Chopsticks clacking, glasses hitting the table lightly. It was really quiet for a spacious place with no real energy or atmosphere. Not too big a deal.  When I went, there were sports jerseys on the walls. The walls were largely empty save for the jersey decor, there wasn't exactly any charm to the place. A little silly, but again definitely not a big deal, after all, we were here for the food.   We were the only ones at the bar despite the fact that it did have other groups there at the tables. It was a little awkward sitting there with people staring at us and with murmurs of conversation.   The sushi didn't taste fresh. Exactly as how another reviewer said, this might be the \"fast food\" of sushi. It was okay. Dry. Bland taste. Not all that delicious. Had most of the rolls. Salmon, yellowtail, eel, California roll etc. In no way am I picky eater at all. Far from it! I'm not one of those sushi-purists that are finicky eaters who crave fine dining. Lol I'm not a sushi snob. Just a sushi lover and not too hard to please. But really, this place was mediocre even for an AYCE choice. Nothing to rave about, much less recommend.   I'm happy this place seems to  have a good following. I'm all for a  local business thriving especially for a sushi place you don't have to drive miles and miles for. Unfortunately, Sushi Tachi won't be my sushi paradise."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi restaurant. Eat here at least twice a month. Have tried numerous other sushi places that offer ayce and this is the best. The service is great, everything looks and tastes amazing, and they offer all you can drink bud light and house sake. My recommendation is the orion roll and the sexy girl."}
{"text":"I love sushi and have tried many different sushi places but decided to give this place a shot, WORST mistake. I was really disappointed with not only the quality but the plating. I do believe people overhype this place a little too much or have just never tried GOOD sushi before. I usually don't post how bad the food is I just don't bother to go again, but not only was I upset at the food but the fact that I tried to beat it on time for lunch which still costs more than some better sushi spots on the strip which is 24.95 for lunch. First of all, the rolls had too much rice! The fish was unevenly cut, the rolls had no sauce nor garnishes that made it taste bland and look boring. The nigiri was the worst! The fish was too thick and chewy and had no flavor. I ordered the calamari and definitely was not what I expected. It was like three shrimp tempura looking things with terrible batter mix they used, they were not even crunchy but soggy. It made me not want to try any fried rolls since I'd probably lose my appetite even more. They didn't offer a variety of sushi bar sides but they did have a good variety of appetizers which my friend did enjoy since he doesn't like fish. Lastly, the dessert was only a choice of green tea ice cream or cookies and cream. For the price and quality I was paying I was definitely expecting something better like their special desserts which is only for dinner but should be offered all the time since better sushi spots like yama, gorilla, or goyeman have a better variety and quality for better or same price. Moral of the story, if it's gonna be your first time trying sushi, pick a different spot so you're not disappointed and never want to eat sushi again"}
{"text":"First time at a sushi restaurant in years and was a can't miss experience.  Exemplary service, excellent cuisine, extraordinary sushi joint. I don't post to Yelp hardly ever and this place was worth talking about. Enjoy the experience Yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi place for me by far in the northside. Hope you guys get to try this place out."}
{"text":"Man, I used to love this place because of Haru, the mad genius sushi chef extraordinaire from Spain.. But now it's just ok.  I give it 3.25 stars"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had that wasn't right next to the ocean with fresh catch. Nice clean taste.  Curry was amazing.  Staff was helpful, service could have been a bit better, had a stack of plates that never got cleared.  We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is also OK. The location is what makes it great. Not a lot of Japanese restaurants in this neck of the woods. The service has always been consistently good; I would rate it 8/10. The chefs are nice and friendly. The lunch specials here are affordable. The sushi quality is good compared to the cost. I hate it when people complain about quality if it is cheap. People have to run a business and make money. I am always aware of that fact. Overall, this place is a great little sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and I will never go back. We arrived at 6 PM and immediately ordered 2 rolls and a side of chicken teriyaki. The AYCE has a 60 minute limit. Our rolls were not brought out until 6:30. The server brought the chicken teriyaki and then realized he brought the meal size portion so took it away. Taste was very bland. We ordered more rolls and 2 orders of shrimp tempura. At 6:45 we saw a man who just sat down being served 2 orders of shrimp tempura. We asked our server about it (since clearly they were ours) and he claimed to remember us ordering them and offered to put in an order then. We decided to leave. We spent $66 and left hungry. The service was absolutely horrible. The female server we had did not know if they served wine. all of the employees seemed to have an attitude and acted like it was a hassle to take orders or serve food."}
{"text":"The worst AYCE place I ever been to, this place is \"all you can WAIT\", first they forced us to order their hot food. Which we didn't. And then When we Ordered their sushi it took more than half an hour. Plus their service is awful. I will Never Ever go to this place again. Try it if u wanna waste your money."}
{"text":"love this place with all my heart. always have a wonderful experience when i am here! the servers always do their best to check on you and they're all pretty young. have had some bad experiences with older servers in sushi restaurants but the ones here will not disappoint! try the 911 roll, most places are just drenched in some hot sauce but the 911 here actually has flavor which I love. tried salmon roe for the first time here as well and it was delish! :) took off one star because I was left unattended one day when it was busy but I am forgiving. :)"}
{"text":"Huge selection, great deals, ayce lives up to its name.  Add free bud light and sake!! (Sunday thru wed with ayce)  I'll be back and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"sushi yeaaa!! i love theyre lunch specials! they also have green tea ice cream! The food is amazing and the service is relatively good. The food def keeps me coming back. The atmosphere is very nice and intimate, great for girls night out or date night with the hubby :)"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my son. We were craving sushi for quite some time now. At first I thought it was a bit pricy. We ordered the all you can eat dinner. It wasn't very busy at the time so we got excellent service from the chefs and wait staff. The food was excellent and we left stuffed.  The staff mentioned specials that we will definitely take advantage of in the future. As a Hawaiian I know good sushi and this was exceptional!"}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because of the service. It took a while for the waitress to bring around my drinks and no one checked on me while eating. The sushi however was very good. Came alone on Saturday night and there was plenty of room at the bar for me."}
{"text":"Dined in here 3 times nice little hole in the wall, service was good and sushi just decent , will go back if in the area."}
{"text":"A great deal. Best All You Can Eat Sushi in the Northwest part of Las Vegas. I love the New Year's Eve Roll!! crunchy. Sushi chefs are nice and personable. AYCE and drink is also awesome!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent. The only reason I don't give five stars is because, in peak hours, the service can be rather slow. This is still my preferred sushi on the north side of town. Very tasty. Very good value. I do wish they would hire one more chef and one more server."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I have ever eaten at. The New York Girl in Vegas is amazing, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  We always get the AYCE and then a separate dinner for our youngest son.  One night he was feeling a little \"sad\" that he was not eating a roll, and they took some chicken katsu, carrot, cucumber and rice and rolled it up in soy paper for him.  Now, that is service! Unless we are in a larger group than 4, we always sit at the bar. Don't forget when you are there, to ask your chef what HIS specialty is!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here! My only complaint would be that when it's busy I feel like they get overwhelmed and everything kind of goes wrong with the order or it never comes out. I always come when it's slow, then they're great!"}
{"text":"Great jewel off the strip. Really fresh and friendly chefs. Def coming back."}
{"text":"Left my wallet here, came back 15m later. Table cleared and our waitress was gone no where to be found. Asked the front and waited for her for 20m he said her shift is over and she isn't here. I really liked this place too. Will speak with manager on Monday. Waitress was kind of annoyed with sudden rush hour, but wouldn't think she would take my wallet."}
{"text":"I came here because the comments were pretty convincing. The sushi rolls were bland. The only roll I can remember and liked was the Tachi roll #2. Not to mention, they charged my 9 year old as an adult because she is tall. She clearly has not hit puberty yet. Her father is 6'3 and I am 5'8. I've been to multiple sushi restaurants with better prices for children and flavors all around. I'd rather Kaya Sushi or Kaizen on deer springs. First and last visit for me. The servers were pretty nice."}
{"text":"I used to come to this sushi place very often, and it used to have pretty good sushi, but over the past 2 years sushi tachi has gotten progressively worse. They do have an AYCE and its in line with most AYCE sushi. The sushi here is really honestly bad. I had the all you can eat here (for the last time) the other day. Every roll that they brought was warm (and not on purpose) the fish was disgusting. Even the edamame was gross! The service was also bad it literally took the server 20 minutes to come over and ask what we wanted to drink and then another 10 minutes to get our drinks and put our sushi orders in we waited over an hour to get any food at all! And when they brought our first couple of rolls half of them were not what we ordered! Then the lady argued that we did order it. Finally she took the food back and brought us what we wanted, which still tasted bad.  I think they've had a change of staff or something but regardless your employees should be properly trained. The two tables next to us also had issues with their food. I wish I could say anything good about this place but if I were you I'd stay away."}
{"text":"Good food with good quality, great service! If you looking for some sushi with budget, this restaurant would work for you for sure!! One of my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and my wife and I stood there for 15 minutes and were not acknowledged. This place has been our go to since 2010. But tonight we were force to try Kaizen up the road and we were impressed with the variety of the rolls and the options that surpassed Sushi Tachi. We will miss our \"Picket Bitch\" and \"Chi-Chi\" rolls but we are impressed with Kaizen."}
{"text":"Been eating at Sushi Tach since the last review in 2012 and recently they have replace the menu's that I notice some reviewers were complaining about well used dirty menu's. Me I never had a problem with the menu being dirty but to put your mind at ease I noticed they have replaced them with new ones. As always AYCE was wonderful. clean facility and friendly staff. I tried the Sake Shooter and OMG I had 2 of them. Ahe Poke is out of this world. Oh and if there is something you don't want, like light on the sauce just ask. When trying a Roll, order a half roll and if you like it order a whole one. Ask and Ye Shall receive, stay silent and get average menu items. everything is as advertised but communication as with anything will make your meal much better. If you want a 911 and tell the chef you want it hotter he will make your toes curl up, be careful what you ask for you might get it :)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Sushi Tachi.  The service is good and the food is even better. My daughter is 6 & we both do the all you can eat sushi which includes shu mai, chicken terriyaki, edamame and many other dishes my daughter loves. The sushi is fresh and made to order and the staff are great!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time as always here!! One of my favorite all you can eat sushi a bars in town! If you haven't tried it you must! Super friendly staff and shorter then normal wait times on everything! Always have the freshest fish and mouth watering dishes. Try the yellowtail collar one of my favorites"}
{"text":"The service was awful. Everything looked rushed and plating was not par. The servers were stressed because there were only two of them on the weekend dinner rush. And 60 mins all you can  eat time limit with 15 minute wait times between plates? What a joke. Kaizen runs laps around this place."}
{"text":"We really love this place!  We have been going here for a few years now and the food is always on point and the service is impeccable.  Even when we can't make the all you can eat sushi, we love to place to go orders for dinner and once again, our orders are always 100% fresh and correct with zero issues at all. Furthermore, it has always been ready by the time they have promised, even on the busiest of nights and weekends.  My only gripe is that we usually bring our kids.  Last summer we brought our 3 year old who can obviously barely finish two pieces of sushi if he's really hungry.  We told our server that he was 3 and usually just grazes off of our plate.  She said they had a rule where he had to be a certain height against one of their counters.  I cringed because my son is in size 5 clothes and is always mistaken for being much older, but you can tell by his language that he is definitely not that age.  Well, he of course measured higher than the counter.  I offered to show his birth certificate that I had coincidentally had on hand after registering him for school and they said it didn't matter, they had to do a height test.  So bizarre lol!  So we paid for him to eat a two piece of the sashimi.  Didn't seem right at all, but we have still continued to order."}
{"text":"Got the all you can eat,  and they over rice everything.  Rice,  rice,  and more rice.  Ordered the super white tuna (ono),  seared salmon, octopus,  garlic tuna and yellow tail nigiri sushi,   they all came out warm with a thick ball of rice each and incredibly unseasoned,  no flavor what so ever. The ocean roll,  sunset roll,  and the yellowtail mambo all are exactly the same,  yet the descriptions are all different.  The garlic ponzu tastes like soy sauce.  The deep fried Shrimp heads tasted of old frying oil.   This place is crowded, we waited for a spot at the bar.  I thought crowded restaurant meant that people really like it.  Maybe they like the all you can drink Bud Light.  I looked around the restaurant, and  everyone was Caucasian.    Anyway I noticed that all the rolls coming out looked exactly the same.   Why would anyone give this place anything higher than  2 stars?  Have they not had proper sushi before?  Does this place not know what sashimi is?  Has the world gone mad?"}
{"text":"I do love this restraunt its currently the \"close to home favorite\" but the last time I went I was kinda turned off. The man who was preparing my rolls was touching and playing with his cellphone bare handed then proceeded to make my roll without washing his hands or wearing gloves. Phones carry so much bacteria on them I was actually grossed out. I know people like messing with their phones but dont be playing with ur dirty phone while ur making my food bro.!"}
{"text":"If you're in the North side, looking for AYCE sushi, then this is your spot. But if you have the chance to travel somewhere else, then I suggest you do so. Sushi is delicious here but service is a big deal if you're going to interact with them every 10 minutes or so. Ate here twice already, once with just my boyfriend & I then the second time with his whole family. Both occasions were different servers & both were not attentive, nice or friendly.  You need better servers for AYCE, just saying. But food was yummy. Will only try it again if I'm craving AYCE sushi & I'm in the North side."}
{"text":"Every time my sister comes to visit, we hit up a AYCE sushi joint. Last monday, this was the spot. It was $26.95 which comes w/bud light and the house sake for 60 mins.   Here is what we had:  3 buds and 2 large sakes spicy tuna hand roll w/masago and a quail egg (me only) 2 orders of ahi poke 1 order of raw tofu 2 orders of salmon and 2 orders hamachi 2 orders of amaebi w/deep fried heads 1/2 of a roll that i forget the name 1 sake shooter (me only) 2 baked scallops 1 salmon collar 1 order of the cajun albacore and 1 order of tako 1/2 roll of new york girl in vegas 1 green tea ice cream 1 pink colored ice cream which i forget the flavor  The food was very good. The fish was fresh. Our sushi chef was the older japanese man. He was great. The waitresses were nice. The place was clean. I'll probably come by myself next time I'm craving sushi when my sister isn't in town. We came here for an early dinner so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to eat more. Great AYCE spot hidden in North Las Vegas.  My sister's one complaint was that the bar stools were too low. Yeah they were a little low."}
{"text":"I went there with my kids, teenagers, we were seated right away, the hostess was friendly and courteous. We ordered 3 Bento Box, two chicken and the other steak. It came with rice, the meat, California roll, one had pot stickers, salad and miso soup, all good. We also got a couple of sushi on the side, salmon skin roll and a crunchy roll, both were really good. The all-you-can-eat sushi would have been ideal but we weren't as hungry. The price for both were reasonable compared to the other sushi restaurants in Vegas. We have gone back several times and the food still taste very good."}
{"text":"The service and food is nearly perfect! I have never had a bad meal here and it continues to be one of my favorite places to go. The prices are great and the food is so fresh. It is also a very clean restuarant. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score was because the bathroom is in a odd area of the resturant. You have to actually walk into the kitchen to reach the restroom. Other than that, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Sushi Tachi and love coming here (I'm sitting in a booth right now). The AYCE menu is a big one and a fair price and the staff is a really nice group of people:-)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years... Love the all you can eat menu! A decent price for awesome sushi!"}
{"text":"Very small place, but well worth a stop. Great all you can eat sushi.  Very friendly service.  Try the Chi Chi Rolls. Our favorite sushi on the North side."}
{"text":"Good sushi places are very limited in the area, so after trying other places, we always end up back here.  They're not always consistent, but they satisfy the last minute cravings."}
{"text":"Love that Bud Light and house sake are included in AYCE Sun-Wed. That, and pretty decent AYCE sushi for NLV makes it awesome!!! Yes, I do have a AYCE sushi in Vegas that I like better, but I live soooo much closer to this place..... An easy 4 stars in my book!  Fresh raw fish is my main criteria!"}
{"text":"Solid sushi place if you're looking for your sushi fix. Not the best sushi i've had by any means, but the Rock'NRoll and the Cristina Roll are good with a little bit of eel sauce drizzled on top. If you've never tried sushi before, know that this place is only average in terms of taste and if you don't like it, don't give up on sushi. Have also had other items on the menu besides the sushi and it's also good food. Great wait staff. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ventured here at the reccomendation of a family member and its close to home. We usually stick to one sushi spot and wanted to try something new.   After sitting down we noticed the other sushi rolls that were being served, they didnt look all that delicious, so we decided to play it safe and order two half rolls to see if we even would like it. We ordered the 911 roll, which made us both want to call 911. Was SPICY as advertised but presentation was horrible, the roll looked more like a square and was squished at the ends. WTH? The only thing that stood out about that roll was that it set our mouth on fire. Nothing else signficant about it, was not \"tasty\" at all. I should have just took a shot of Siracha hot sauce instead. We also ordered one of the Tachi rolls. It was okay. Better than the 911 roll, it had some taste. Lastly we ordered garlic tuna sushi...which was missing the key ingredient...the GARLIC sauce! It had just a minute drizzle on each piece. FAIL. We ended up leaving and going to our regular sushi spot.   That staff however was very polite, quick service, and all smiles.   Lesson learned, the grass was not greener on the other side for us.  BLAH!"}
{"text":"I came here on a giant sushi craving. It was okay. I wouldn't come back because there really wasn't anything special.   We had the boat sushi and it was okay. The fish was good it did satisfy my sushi craving, but I'd rather go some place else to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"Randomly went here while hungry and in the area!  Had the all you can eat, which is a good value for almost anyone who can eat a decent amount.  We went on a Saturday and therefore they didn't have their all you can drink, which if you drink seems like an excellent value.  Now the sushi is very mediocre in my opinion.  Would probably go back one more time to try the all you can eat and drink special.  Hopefully the sushi is better.  I think that you don't get the same portion for an all u can eat vs a regular a la carte portion?  I don't think this place merits 4.5 stars though for sure!!  3 seems right, 4 is pushing it....."}
{"text":"I go here ONLY for the chicken Cutlet curry, which is 99% on point with coco ichibanya in japan. It is the closest thing we can find as military members to treat us like we are in Japan still. Even though I can drive 4-5 hours to california for the actual coco ichibanya, this is the next best thing. Sushi is also delicious there!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Vegas! Where should I begin...  I don't eat sushi much. And if I do eat sushi its only the cooked/deep fried selections I'll eat. But on this visit, I was the sushi master!! Everything from tuna to soft shell crab, salmon to eel, and even a bit of yellowtail. I swear the menu had about 100 different sushi items to choose from and I've probably made it through 20 so I'll be back to claim my crown and throne from this sushi warrior challooonge (challenge)!  To get the bang for ya buck, you have to go for the All You Can Eat sushi deal for $24.99. That includes unlimited sushi and bud light or sake. Let's just say we indulged ourselves into pure bliss. Baked salmon hand wraps, spicy tuna tempura rolls, and deep fried eel rolls are bomb.com! The only downer about this place is that its small. The sushi bar area can sit maybe 10 people and the dinning area is decent. The tv's stay on ESPN but no.volume just closed caption.  The only way to enjoy this review to its perfect extent is to put on those lose jeans/gym shorts, prepare your appetite, and get your fanny down to Sushi Tachi and get your grub on! Lol."}
{"text":"All i have to say is the food there is exceptional my wife and i always get the all you can eat sushi from sunday-thursday because not only is it all you can eat sushi and some kitchen items its all you can drink bud light and house saki but friday and saturday this offer for the beer and saki is not available. the sushi itself is very fresh and the staff are very friendly and get you your food quickly for kitchen items. And if you plan on going back be sure to get a stamp card for the all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Our go to sushi spot!!! We are regulars and love the food and service! If you love sushi this is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to this place because it's his absolute favorite! He's been going for years and I recently started joining. The sushi chefs know him the moment he walks through the door and remember his order every time for all you can eat. They have amazing service and so personalized.   I don't like sushi because I don't like raw fish. However, their menu has a lot of options for cooked rolls and you even have the option to order a half a roll. This is great for me! I order the rock n roll, jj roll, and lisa lisa and I love them! Each filled with different things like tempura shrimp, crab, cream cheese, asparagus, etc. The cooked mussels are my favorite so flavorful and fresh! They also have plenty of options from the kitchen such as edamame, calamari, teriyaki chicken, etc.   The pricing is reasonable, $26 for lunch or $29 for dinner. The restaurant is tiny and is somewhat hidden next to an EOS Gym but it is very popular. There is one large table you can fit up to about 20 but the remaining tables seat about 4 people. I highly suggest stopping in for AYCE!"}
{"text":"I have to say I love this sushi restaurant. It's $26.95 for all you can eat at dinner time, but the food is very good.  You also get free all you can drink bud light on Sundays and Mondays (I have never had it, but its nice to have the offer).  I really have no complaints about this place.  I usually eat here about once a month and every time it has been an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Always great food and service!   Come here regularly and will continue.  There are many sushi restaurants in the area, and I've tried most of them.  This place is the best."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places for all-you-can-eat! They even have all-you-can-drink sake on certain nights. The chefs are always nice and friendly. We always recommend Sushi Tachi and try to take friends here when sushi is what we are craving!"}
{"text":"I love his place! Employees and chefs are always nice and on top of it. I go here often and haven't had a bad experience yet. The all you can eat says 1 hour but we always stay longer and haven't been rushed out ever. It also says  on certain days but we've gone in on everyday of the week and got the all you can eat deal. It included all items on the menu even from the kitchen and bud light and saki. You couldn't ask for more from a sushi bar!"}
{"text":"We normally go to another place in the Aliante area. Thought we'd try Sushi Tachi for something new.  It was so so.  The service was horrible. It took 20 minutes for someone to come to our table. We all ordered AYCE.  It took 30 minutes for our first roll to come.  And that was just one persons roll. We only had one roll each by the time the hour was up. The server tried telling us that she was going to have to charge us for the extra rolls that we had ordered since our time was up.  What?!?!?!  Not our fault they were as slow as molasses. Needless to say we won't be back. We'll stick with our go to place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  They're very friendly and polite, they recognized us the second time we went (and every time since). The All-You-Can-Eat is a great deal, it even throws in some extras like saki shooters. The half-orders on rolls is a great option. There's non-fishy options for those dragged along for the sushi experience. They even offer a frequent-eater punch card! (Buy 10, get 1 free?)   The ONLY bad thing about this place? It's hard to find! The map shows it completely wrong! It's the SE corner of Centennial and Simmons."}
{"text":"I'm back with a super disappointed review.  I've been in now 3 times with no tables.  There is literally no room to wait and They have been kinda rude about the wait so I've left all 3 times.  Tonight they had 3 tables open but I was told they were reserved.  Are you serious?  Haven't eaten here in months and we used to come pretty regularly.  Guess I'm looking for a new Japanese restaurant.  Not cool sushi tachi."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best finds in NLV! Fish is fresh!!! I am very picky I have done sushi wow and sushi loco a lot of places around Vegas! My husband and I have been coming here since it openned. Staff changes but Haro has been here quite a while and is worth getting to know! This is a must for true sushi lovers!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times now and it has been great each time.   They have an All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu available for lunch and dinner that is pretty great for the price.  The quality of the Nigiri is very good, with the fish large enough to cover both ends of the rice, which is something you don't expect with AYCE.  The menu also has a very large and elaborate selection of hand and specialty rolls.  The AYCE menu also has things like miso soup, chicken teriyaki, tempura, desert, etc...  all for $20 per person for lunch and ~$26 for dinner.  As others have mentioned there is a time limit listed for the AYCE menu, we actually asked the owner about this the first time we visited and he said it's just there to prevent abuse. I'd recommend the AYCE menu for groups who like sushi and want to try all the different nigiri and specialty rolls.  As others have mentioned they have some great lunch specials.  This place is definitely worth a visit if you want some quality sushi for a price that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Service and the quality of food is awesome.   Everytime I come I get the AYCE/AYCD (Sun-Thur) deal ! Start off with there baked mussels and scallops then off with the rolls. I'm a big fan of baked rolls and their baked rolls are tasty !  Don't forget to try the specials on the board behind the sushi bar !"}
{"text":"I use to go here a lot, having lived in the area before, it was a favorite. Today it just happened to be halfway between a friend and I, perfect for a lunch date but we were both disappointed. Service was rude- 2 girls took turns both taking care of us and more often then not when we asked for something we were told to \"hold a minute\" & when they came back they'd forget about what we did ask.  Quality of sushi was not up to par either, unequal in size and sloppy-did not hold its shape. Hopefully just a bad day and not always like this, I use to really enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Really good sushi, great service and nice atmosphere. First time in here and we'll go back. We've lived all over the country and really enjoy finding a good sushi restaurant. This is our new place in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"expected a good date night atmosphere, but I was wrong. It was a bit cafeteria atmosphere. Ordered sushi the most expensive one and oh no, it was bad. Not fresh, just old maguros on top must be frozen several times.   This place might be the place for only Americanized Californian rolls, but not for the sushi-sushi. Drink served in cheap plastic cups and food and dirts on the floor, plain cafeteria look.   I don't recommend this place if someone picks here for date night"}
{"text":"No way these guys get 4 stars.  Somebody needs to tell these people that they're not on the strip. LOWER UR PRICES!!!!! You're sushi isn't that good and service was ehhhh at best. You're better off going to smiths and getting their pre-made sushi.  They need to close this place down and scrub the grease smell out of it and do some dusting also."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it's our date night spot!!!"}
{"text":"Awful! Why does this place have more than 2 stars?? Is it because of the beer specials? It's certainly not for the food or service!! This place offers AYCE at strip prices but not at strip quality. I came with friends on a Friday night, my second visit only because a friend likes their half orders. I was leary because of the slooooooooow service before but decided it could deserve another chance. BAD IDEA!!!  It was very busy and the wait was long. Once seated the waiter was attentive and suggested we place an order straight away, after looking at the full restaurant we decided it was a good suggestion. We should have researched and placed our entire order for the night because it took over an hour to get half an order in and received!! They had very few staff which makes no sense on a busy Friday night! Half our table was already eating dessert by the time the other half of the table had received their main sushi course! Our party had to leave and I had to leave with them even though I didn't get my order at all. AYCE here not worth another visit and the food quality is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Good food, good sushi and reasonable prices for AYCE. Dinnertime in the weekends can get pretty busy so sushi may take longer than usual. Sushi rolls can also get sloppy when they're busy. They have a large selection but beware of the 911 roll. We always get the salmon collar and their ice cream is excellent. Most of their food is average but we always get great service. 4/5"}
{"text":"I've been going her for a few years now and it was good before but now their EXCELLENT!!! They have recently hired a new chef Harold (Haru)  he was fast and attentive.  He cut some gloriously thick slices for the Nigiri, Maguro, Salmon & Yellow tail! The food that comes out of the kitchen is all well prepared, and I recommend the tasty green mussels but I go for the sushi For an all-you-can-eat-in-under-an-hour kind of place, the fish is always fresh.  Chatting w/ Harold he asked me what I liked and how spicy I like my food & after 2 of the menu rolls he asked if he could make me something off the menu I told him cool do your thing. it was AMAZING!!!! He calls it a mother w/ child (salmon on the outside w/ salmon roe a delicately sliced lil piece of lemon) after that he was free to make me what he wanted and after that decision I have never had so many total melt-in-my-mouth moments. Considering the quality of Harold's work, the A.Y.C.E. hour is the way to go.   But be careful.  By the time I was ready to leave, I thought I was going to burst because i could not stop eating and when i finally did I remembered that rice expands in your stomach.......SO AGAIN BEWARE!!!  The only thing bad I can say about Sushi Tachi is don't go on Wed or Thurs (Harold's nights off)"}
{"text":"Really good sushi and one of my favorites!!! This place gets busy because its that good. Just check out the reviews and try them out. Its a real gem!!! :)"}
{"text":"I was a US Marine stationed in mainland Japan for 3 years. I swore if i ever went to a Japanese restaurant i'd either REALLY want it or it'd better be some of the best stuff ever.  This place...WOW  The size of the place is just perfect it's not too big but it's big enough to hold a good crowd, it's small enough to look crowded or semi crowded when it's not up to full capacity.   The pricing is very unique, you can either go by the cost of individual pieces or go for the 45min all u can eat set price for lunch or the 60min all u can eat set price for dinner. The price is okay considering that's how much a high end buffet costs anyway.  The thing that changed my opinion about this place is that the menu is very creative you can get standard stuff like every place has, i made the mistake of getting a California roll for a start before my buddy told me i can get anything i want because it's already paid for. HIGHLY recommend the Mahi Mahi...thingie...it's on the specialties part of the menu bottom left corner. The leaf they put on the roll makes biting into it so refreshing and the tartness of the sauce they drizzle over just ties everything together. Simply amazing  I give this place 5 stars because of the creativity of some of the things on the menu. There are things i didn't like and some faults i noticed  MAYONNAISE oh god i hate how the Japanese love squirting the stuff on everything. The baked muscle and scallop shell are just covered and baked in mayonnaise, completely killed the sweet natural seafood flavors of the muscle and scallop.   In conclusion i will be returning to this restaurant when ever I'm in the rare mood for sushi"}
{"text":"I always get the dinner special here! Service here is super friendly and helpful. Parking is free and its not hard to find. Havnt tried the all you can eat sushi yet but one of these nights i will. There hamachi kama is also super ono over here. Prices are pretty cheap too for what you get. I bring friends here and they all surprised at what we get and the quality of the food. If your looking for good quality japanese styled food this is a good stop if your up here on the north side of town."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar in vegas. Sushi chefs are great n very helpful. They also have tepanyaki tables.. great place"}
{"text":"The sushi is really good but the past two times I have gone, the service was VERY slow. It should not take 30 minutes to take our order."}
{"text":"Brought the entire FAM bam for supper tonight and we all had the AYCE. Our two youngest ones were measured against a mark on the wall and got a lower price for being shorter... So sweet! Service was fast, there was no rushing us, we enjoyed every roll that was brought out. Definitely be coming back. I just wish they had better seating. 5 people in one booth was a bit crowded, the tablespace was limited too.   It was a good first time sushi experience for the kids. They all want to come back again already!"}
{"text":"Was able to enjoy a great meal during my Birthday weekend! Very nice ambience, attentive wait staff, fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The servers were all very nice. Good energy from everyone. We got the all you can eat lunch. The rules are the same as every where else as far as no left overs unless you would like to be charged no sharing unless the other person has AYCE as well. The time limit of 1 hour isn't the longest I've seen but it was enough for us. On to the food. There were rolls that were very delicious and then some that were not. I personally did not like their garlic ponzu sauce however their spicy mayo was the opposite. I overall enjoyed the visit and unlike a few places I have been I was happy to taste their fresh ingredients. Some places give you old shrimp tempura in the roll and it is obvious and decreases the taste value of the roll by a lot. Well 4 stars from me which is as good as you can get unless i loved every flavor and taste from my favorite rolls."}
{"text":"In the outskirts of North Las Vegas, there lies a gem. Not just any gem, but a gem lost in the neighborhoods of Aliante. A gem that has strayed from the inner city and traveled along to make it's own way into our hearts... err, stomachs that is! ;) I can speak for many sushi lovers out there that love and enjoy the comforts and different tastes that a lot of sushi bars and restaurants offer to their patrons.  A comfortable and home-like setting provides the city and part of Aliante a place to make their own and enjoy great eats without the rage and rush of middle aged adults. Sometimes, a quiet place is in order to enjoy great company and conversation. And upon reading that semi-theatre-esque introduction, Sushi Tachi is that hidden gem in Aliante.  The menu is pretty similar to the Sushimon chain, but what really makes this place stick out is their outstanding service and polite manners. 3 stars for the similar menus to Sushimon but location and service give Sishi Tachi a generous!  Baked green mussels and cajun albacore nigiri FTW! Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh fish, quaint spot that obviously have so many frequent returning local customers (hence the offered punch card). AYCE and all you can drink house beer and sake for 25? Get out of here!!! I also love the fact that you can do half rolls to try a little bit of everything. It's not just sushi but an extensive menu of hot items too which is something you don't see too often. My favorite is probably the Cristina roll.  Go here, love it. Best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi....was my favorite Sushi bar i would make the 30 min trip from spring valley up to 3 times a week. However Haru (the head sushi chef) no longer works here thus this place is just another sushi bar :/ i will no longer be driving there any more. i resign the crown of duchess to Tachi"}
{"text":"Pretty good and close for AYCE Sushi.  AAYCD Bud Lights and sake too."}
{"text":"We love sushi tachi, waiters are very nice and attentive. Food is great quality and fresh. All you can eat included free beer and saki sun-thurs unlimited. I have been there dozens of times in the past few years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"What? I'm so confused why this place has a high rating. Decided to hit up this place in NLV cause I was chillin' with a fried.  We were starving. We wanted fish. We wanted some place close.  Had AYCE for lunch, it was about $26.  Nigiris are okay. Fresh but the rice ratio. Uh-uh, too much rice.  Rolls, you can order half. Make sure you eat your rolls right away cause if you leave it out, it gets gross.  I'd come back but I really don't see the point of driving all the way to North town."}
{"text":"I liked this place alot! The food and service was great! And I really like the ALL you can eat Sushi idea! The only thing is that its kinda expensive. Most dishes were more then $12 for 8 pieces. All the chefs were really cool though. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Dined here after reading all of the rave reviews of this place.  Had pretty high expectations and wanted to love it.  Unfortunately, will never eat here again.   If I were the kind of person who'd consider panda express to have the best Chinese food or olive garden to have the best Italian food then I'd prolly consider this place to have the best sushi.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's like the panda express of sushi.   We didn't get the AYCE cuz, well, we don't do AYCE sushi.  Tried to order some nigiri but they didn't have any really good types of fish.  Just the standards: tuna, salmon, yellowtail.  So ordered a couple of rolls with various fish selections.   Nothing was remarkable and the salmon was slimy.  the service was all but non-existent. we sat at the sushi bar and were ignored by all 4 sushi chefs which would be forgivable if the bar was full but there was only 1 other customer there. 4 chefs to 3 people. hm.  it seems as though they have quite a loyal following which is fantastic for them and i hope that those patrons continue to be just that, loyal."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi packed with flavor in a small restaurant.  The bar is huge and takes up tons of space but dining is still ample.   They serve AYCE and all you can drink beer and Sake but the alcohol is only Sunday- Thursday.   The Poke is delicious and very fresh.   The service was good but a bit slow as we had a party of 16. The servers were very patient and friendly.  Food came out and everyone was happy.   The location is a bit of a drive from the strip bit well worth the visit.   Fortunately my friends were staying at the Santa Fe so it wasn't even a ten minute drive.   Parking is easy to find so I'd probably return here again if back in Vegas.   Next time ill drop in on a Sunday to enjoy the beer and sake.   If you really want to enjoy this place, be sure to come with a small party.   That way you can order what you want and get it quickly as there is a time limit on the AYCE."}
{"text":"I love this small all you can eat Japanese restaurant, all the staff are friendly, their food are fresh. Chef is very nice, they don't put a huge rice underneath the sashimi, they don't monitor while you are eating.  This place is good for family also, they have big table for 6-10 ppl. Their sashimi is fresh cut everyday. Nothing left over from the previous day. Sunday to Wed also have all you can drink....... :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi is my go to sushi spot . All you can eat is 23-26. There are so many other items that you can order besides sushi in the all you can eat menu ( teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, Michu ice cram etc. sushi tachi is pretty small so the ambiance is always really comfy and chill. Prices are good and sushi is good too."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi spot.  We always do the all you can eat because we have so many favorites!  The Santa Roll and Tuna Roll are a couple of our favorites....  Staff is always awesome."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with a few friends who had talked the place up.  I won't say that I'm a sushi connoisseur, but I've eaten my fair share.  To be honest, the fish didn't taste as fresh as it should.  I was underwhelmed by the quality, and the speed of service definitely left something to be desired.  We were seated at 5pm, decided on AYCE, and we weren't served our first roll until 530!  On top of that, we had to pester the waitress to even get our place settings.  Because we didn't get the wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce until after the first roll was brought out, we didn't actually start eating until 545.  Luckily, they were lax on their 60 minute time limit, otherwise, we may have only eaten two rolls between all four of us.  Unless the service and quality see a marked change, I most likely won't be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"I ventured all the way up here from Henderson to meet a friend for dinner. The restaurant is on the small side (but about average for a sushi place) and doesn't have the best decor. The booths are ripped and worn and there isn't really any unifying decor theme to speak of.   They offer both a la carte and AYCE options (AYCE is $27 per person for 60 minutes). We ate glutton-style. The menu is huge and the waitstaff definitely doesn't give you enough time to look over the whole thing before they're standing over you, ready for your order. You are able to order more than one item at a time, which is nice. The sushi bar is quick, while the kitchen is a bit on the slow side.   The sushi was fine. The fish was good-quality, but none of the rolls I sampled really wowed me. They are a bit rice-heavy and every single roll has sauce, which can be dangerous. None of the flavors really melded or set each other off in a delicious way. This restaurant seems to be an excellent example of doing a lot not that well, rather than doing a little bit extremely well. I think if they pared the menu down by half (seriously, it's that huge) and created a handful of well thought-out, complementary rolls, the experience would be much more enjoyable.  Food to dollars ratio: unimpressive, might be worth it if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always get the Dragon roll and I think the name of the other roll I get is called the moon roll. The fact that they have half orders available on the menu really tickles my fancy. It's very affordable and the quality is good for the price.  I would say the only downsides are that I'm too short whenever I sit at the sushi bar, and the servers make me feel like I'm being smothered. Never fails."}
{"text":"Where do i begin....We decided to drive out of our way to check out this spot based on the reviews and the AYCE with AYCD (all you can drink) included. So it turns out the address on yelp is incorrect because it took us at least 6 miles out of the way. We get there just to find out that they only do the AYCE with AYCD on certain days. I understand that i shouldn't rely completely on internet information to determine menu and address, but doesn't the business itself heavily rely on the information online to generate business?? We got there disappointed and explained our situation and that the information on yelp was incorrect. They showed no sympathy at all to make an exception and honor the deal. It is also sad that I, the customer, has to inform the people that the address is incorrect. If you decide for whatever dumb reason to go to this retched place, the correct address is 2805 W Centennial Pkwy"}
{"text":"I did the AYCE and they have a wide selection of sushi rolls to choose from.  The good thing about this place is you can order half rolls so you don't fill up too fast on just one.  Went on a Friday night around 7, wasn't too packed, they also have bar seating."}
{"text":"sushi wasn't too bad, specially for an ayca sushi. But the lady had the audacity to demand  tips after not only they ignored our table but the big dude gave us attitude."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi, good service and good value at price. Really happy to have a quality sushi joint nearby to where I live."}
{"text":"There's no place in Aliante like Sushi Tachi, and no host quite like Jimmy, who treats everyone as a long lost, most treasured uncle! We eat take-out several times a week, and have also dined-in. The food is consistently superb, and even vegetarians will find the menu accomodates them nicely. Greatly appreciated: Sushi Tachi gives you the choice of soy paper wrappers instead of seaweed for sushi. Fast, attentive service at a very reasonable price, while retaining reputation for excellent cuisine. I couldn't make it a week without eating at Sushi Tachi--even though there are several other sushi restaurants in the area. This is the BEST, and the best value for the $$."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times - I have filled up 3 of those all you can eat cards. The food is pretty good, sushi is pretty good. bathroom could use a good scrub down. the whole menu is part of the all you can eat. Including beer / sake on the right nights."}
{"text":"What an experience! Dined here while visiting friends in the area. It was decided before we arrived we'd be having the $26 pp all you can eat option. I was a little skeptical that all the items we'd try would've tasty or that the portion size for an all you can eat option would be very big. I was wrong on both accounts though! Very tasty sushi, miso soup, cucumber salad & beer!! Couldn't believe the number if items available on the all you can eat menu nor the number of items we constantly had rotating from the sushi bar to our table. This place would be a very dangerous option for this sushi loving couple if we lived it the area. Would love to come back again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Once again, Tachi is so convenient! I enjoy the sushi. Keep in mind it is AYCE, not Yellowtail at the Bellagio. Price is fair and the all you can drink Bud Lights are a blessing in disguise.   I recommend the Christina Roll, the ahi poki, and Cajun albacore.   Stop by and ask for Yuka!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Tachi! The Tachi #2 has been a long time guilty pleasure of mine, basically for the avocado, cream cheese, and deep fried elements. I tried the sashimi combo for 2 and it was the best meal value I've ever had! $25 to stuff two people with yummy fish, shrimp/vegetable tempura, chicken, rice, miso soup, and ice cream to finish it all off... it doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant and I'm a big fan. I tried a 1/2 roll that had shrimp tempura, avocado, and cream cheese on the inside and then crunch and eel sauce on the outside. It was really good and perfect for me since I'm pregnant and can't/won't eat real sushi. I then ordered the dinner special which is like a bento box. This is my review of the items in that dinner special:  miso soup - pretty good but a little saltier than I'm used to salad w/ house dressing - it was ok  teriyaki chicken - I did not like this white rice - average shrimp/vegetable tempura - pretty good california roll - delicious and it comes with 8 huge pieces  My husband and I also ordered the tempura fried chocolate ice cream which was delicious. I also have to rave about the price. My dinner special was only $10 and my 1/2 roll was around $4. These are great prices and I was beyond stuffed when we left!! I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sushi can be hit or miss... This place was a grand slam! The all you can eat menu is extensive, and the service is great. I have never had sushi prepared as quickly as they do it at Sushi Tachi... And so tasty too! I was very pleased to have found this place."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Tachi with a friend for dinner. He had the all-you-can-eat, which came with free bud light or saki and I ordered ala carte. The sushi was good but not the best I have ever had. I was satisfied with my meal and my friend liked everything he ordered. They said there was a 60 minute limit on the all-you-can-eat but we were their about 90 minutes and he kept eating. I would go back as it was close to my friends house. Restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly... Could have been a little faster bringing our sushi but overall had a good experience."}
{"text":"Sushi tachi in short words is just amazing, this place has all you can eat with fresh ingredients and the best by far customer service! So friendly and catering that perhaps they just became my favorite sushi joint in town, try the uni(sea urchin) nigiri sushi and just wait to be delighted by the delicious flavors!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi roll is the NY girl in Vegas. Order it now, thank me later. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the staff isn't always the greatest."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi... I used to picture week old fish and slimy seaweed, until I found this place.  Sushi Tachi has great sushi, good service, and all you can eat of it.   I don't know of any other place where you can get all the sushi your heart desires for ~$20 (outside of eclectic buffets) and still have it taste good.  Come hungry and get the all you can eat sushi, then go for half portions so you can sample their delicious menu."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is pretty awesome for all you can eat sushi. The sushi isn't the best that I have had in town, but its pretty good.  I went with three friends from work, and we all ordered the AYCE lunch at $24.95 (dinner is $26.95, with only a few items available only at dinner).    The sushi itself was pretty good, despite the non-Asians behind the bar.  Its just sushi after all.  The fish seemed fresh, although the octopus was a little rubbery compared to a couple of other spots I've been to.  The rolls were rushed through and falling apart a little, but that wasn't a big deal at all.  A few of the specialty rolls were really good, including the Valentines roll.  Since we all bought the lunch special, we could all share, and good times were had.  The ginger was particularly good here too.  It was light yellow in color, and sweeter with a less pickled flavor.  I am not a big fan of ginger in general, but this ginger was really tasty.  The one thing that was offsetting was the abundance of signs explaining the rules of the all you can eat... rules like eating all of the rice or paying full price.  I didn't feel like the place was very hospitable when we sat down at first.  Even my friend said jokingly, \"Feels like a dictatorship in here.\"  That feeling changed though because the service was really nice.        Overall, while I would say there is better sushi in Vegas, the AYCE aspect scores this spot an easy 4 stars.  I would love to go back when I am in the mood for a quick, yet thorough stuffing of sushi!"}
{"text":"Place is bomb dot com fresh fish and saki was good , great service my friends loved it at killed it so manny rolls and poki ahi"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place by accident. After eating here the first time and finding out that they have all you can drink included with their ayce menu, I was hooked. The food is good. The service has always been great. Everyone is very friendly. They have a good variety of things on their ayce menu. A variety of appetizers and kitchen items on the menu is what I look for with ayce. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's wanting to try it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my friends we did all you can eat sushi and it included all you can drink beer and sake. This is the first place I go that has that, it was pretty exciting! The rolls overall are great. I would definitely go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for lunch one day. We wanted to try a new sushi place and this place had good reviews. It was not crowded but it was a Monday afternoon. The service was good for a lunch meal. The menu is pretty big and I love hat they include pics as well. The big issue I have is that the rolls don't look anything like the pictures. It's really not that big of a deal but it was a little issue. Other than that the food was OK. Nothing spectacular but just a little better than average. With Kaizen being around the corner (my favorite spot) I don't know if I'll be back but I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"It has the prices of the AYCE places closer to the strip but the quality just isn't there. The freshness was just a little less than I'd hope for on some of the Nigiri pieces. The rolls were good and their sauces are tasty. The service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I'd give it zero stars if I could. I came here Saturday night with my boyfriend for date night. First off the restaurant itself just seemed dirty and outdated. I was craving sushi so I got the ayce and really wish I hadn't. The sushi wasn't fresh at all. The pieces were fairly small and tasteless. The rolls were really rice heavy with barely any fish in them. My boyfriend got a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was awful. He didn't even eat half of it. The service was not so great either. My cup sat empty for most my meal as the waitress just walked back and forth. On top of that they brought me out an extra plate stacked on top of dirty ones. So not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Vegas. The prices are very reasonable and the food is outstanding. Their all you can eat menu is huge and offers a large variety of sushi and kitchen items. They offer ramen, bento boxes, iron, soba, teriyaki and tons of rolls. They use cream cheese a lot in their rolls which offers a ton of flavor! I would highly recommend sushi tachi!"}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite AYCE sushi bar (probably because it's really close to her house), but I've never been disappointed after eating here.   The AYCE menu has plenty of options and you can order things not on the menus for the chefs (like yellowtail belly) & if they have it on hand, they'll give it to you too. The AYCE dinner price also includes hot sake and budlignt on certain nights which is an awesome deal!   The service is always good and the sushi fresh (although I received some questionable uni once, but they took it back without issue). They provide AYCE stamp cards so you can work your way up to a free meal which is always nice too."}
{"text":"We lived in Japan for almost 5 years and know good sushi versus bad sushi.  We had tried several local sushi places without finding The One.  A friend of ours told us to try Sushi Tachi and we've been going ever since.  We do the all you can eat and start off by ordering tuna, salmon, and yellow tail nigiri to see which fish is the best that day.  Typically two of the three are fresh and mouth watering.  We then continue ordering those and a few rolls which vary depending on our mood.  We always order the veggie tempura (which are amazing), gyoza, and calamari from the kitchen.  Put those orders in right away because they sometimes take awhile especially if they are busy.   If you are looking for authentic sushi, this is the place to go!  It's our go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Before going we read mixed reviews, some raved about how it is the best sushi in Vegas, others said it isnt as good as it used to be.  We decided to order al la carte instead of all you can eat. IF we ever go again I will definitely be getting all you can eat, we ended up spending just as much, if not more on al la carte. For the quality of sushi and the price we paid, not worth it. The cruch roll tasted like it was sitting in the fridge for days. I expexted so much more based off the reviews. The environment, quality and service was not worth the $120 bill for four people. However I will say the servers were nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here when I'm in the mood for a nice balanced assortment of all you can eat sushi but feel like I want to be wholly ignored by a seemingly nice but frazzled wait staff. The trick is to order everything you want from the all you can eat menu as soon as you sit down. Heck, write a list down on your paper doily and just hand it to them. Make sure you order everything you want, as they're not likely to approach you again until it's time to pay."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place in NW area. AYCE is great, good selection of Nigiri, friendly servers, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very poor service give you 60 minutes for all you can eat. Your luck if you get 2 orders in 60 minutes portions are very small."}
{"text":"No matter how many times I try new sushi places based on others' recommnedations, I always come back to Sushi Tachi.  Nothing really compares to Sushi Tachi in quality, presentation, and value.  As a sushi lover for 25 years, in addition to freshness and cleanliness, I look for simplicity.  Many sushi restaurants now mask their sushi (especially rolls) by using too much sauce on top or bottom of the rolls.    If you want simple, good nigiri sushi, this is still the best sushi place in the north/northwest part of Las Vegas.  All you can eat deal, which includes pretty much everything they make in the restaurant, is hard to beat."}
{"text":"It's Friday night, and I was craving some sushi but I didn't feel like driving all the way to Yama for some nommy sushi.  I then decided that I was going to try something new since it's been awhile I tried a new sushi joint. I did some research on here nearest to the house and this place came up first. (for all you stalkers, yes I live in North Las Vegas).  Gives you an idea how much I love YAMA.. 20 miles away and been there over 30 times!!! I think I got Duchess status on there =P Anywho, back to my point..   So this place is located on the corner of Centennial parkway and Simmons, right across from Fresh and Easy, Southeast corner of simmons where the Starbucks is at.  The AYCE sushi is $26.95pp. Which I thought a bit pricey for something I am trying new. I was thinking of going down the street to Sage Sushi for couple bucks less, but i went here for the adventure with my daughter. So we get there at about 1010pm. The YELP ad says, they close at 1130 so I thought, \"Cool, we got time\".. Soon as we sat down, server asked us for our drinks and the sushi bar chef asked for my order. 19 minutes later, tells me that I have 1 more minute to order,mind you I only have ordered the following: Spicy Tuna roll, and rainbow roll, edamame. I asked why he's giving me \"last call\" he said that he has to close his section by 1030. I told him I just got there! So he told me order more, so I just picked random ones I dont normally order, a lasagna roll, cream cheese based baked roll with scallops and ahi poke.. tuna salad..   How was it? None of the fishes (tuna) used in my rolls smelled or tasted fresh.. It was \"fishy\" and fish isn't supposed to smell and taste \"fishy\" if it's FRESH.. so yeah, it was gross... I had to wash down my food with red bean ice cream and diet coke!!! And i never drink soda at an AYCE joint, I usually drink water with lemon.. but that was too harsh, the lemon brought out the staleness of the fish even more when I went ahead and chased my stale sushi fish with water..YUK  Verdict.. $62 later, plus 20% tip (because i just do 20% as rule of thumb) I was out of there by merely 11pm.. total of 45mins, $75 less in my pocket, and not very happy... since It  had left a funny taste in my mouth.. LITERALLY! I Aint never gonna come back!! psshhhhh!!  This is what I get for cheating on YAMA.. (I love you YAMA)"}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday night with my boyfriend and roommate and had AYCE. The restaurant looked clean and for a sushi joint it had really bright lighting. They have all you can drink Bud Light and House Sake Sunday through Wednesday which is nice. The rolls were pretty basic nothing really stood out, the sauces on the rolls were placed on the rolls kind of on the sloppy side. My Philadelphia Roll came with cucumber instead of avocado like they usually do. But the fish is extremely fresh!  Our waitress was nice but unfortunately never refilled my water. Everytime she would drop an order off at our table she would run off so fast that it was extremely difficult to continue ordering or ask for refills. Although it says that they have frequent buyer cards we were not offered one. I gave them 3 stars because their ingredients are good quality and maybe we came in on an off night. I would consider going back but I'm definitely going to scope out other sushi joints in the area."}
{"text":"Decent desert sushi and passable service, but Yelp has the map wrong related to the address.  Eat the sushi, don't bother trying to \"check-in,\" and be sure to ask for Mochi."}
{"text":"I really like Sushi Tachi for a few different reasons, but I don't think it's the best sushi I've ever had. They have a really good selection of rolls, and all you can eat as well. I've never ventured into the ayce realm so I can't speak about that.  The special roll listed at the bar is always good and interesting. My favorite part is that this place let's you order half rolls, which is awesome for me. I get a bigger variety with less waste! The miso soup is nothing special, vegetable tempura is good. I love their steamed shrimp shumai. Delicious.  The service here is hit or miss. Some of the servers seem confused most of the time. I've had many items forgotten and wrong items brought. It's never a catastrophe, but hopefully they'll step up their game!"}
{"text":"What happened Sushi Tachi? Used to be good but after last night's visit, I don't even know if we're going back to your place! The nigiri sushi are packed with lots of rice! Felt cheated on the AYCE! It seems like there was some slime on the mackerel and the salmon skin hand roll is mushy inside. Sorry Yuka we are gonna miss you! Very Sad:("}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place. Went there for lunch, i paid for lunch price and my husband the dinner price. Waitress will not let me order my husbands choices that was only available for dinner price. Why does iit matter? Theres a limit 1on their special sushi anyway. Even the dessert i wanted mochi and she said it was only available for the dinner price. And her point was? So my husband had to actually order it since he paid for the dinner price.nbad bad service"}
{"text":"I've been to this place over a dozen times, great service and excellent fresh sushi, they have football jerseys hanging on the walls and always have some kind of sport playing on the tube, their ahi poke bowl is delicious! from handrolls to uni they have sushi that's first timer friendly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The food is a delicacy.  The presentation is simplistic for Japanese food but the flavor of the food with each bite is an explosion of culture and desire."}
{"text":"This place is the best all you can eat sushi on the north side! I only like Haru sushi chef because he is the only one that knows how to make sushi... I ordered a poke salad from one of the other guys and it had literally 5 dinky pieces of sushi and a handful of seaweed! I ordered it from Haruand my god it was the best poke salad I ever had... Haru is ironchef of sushi tachi!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while on a business trip. Ordered one of their combination box lunches. The food was just average. Nothing outstanding nor bad at the same time. Portion size was just right. The chicken teriyaki wasn't dry but the flavor was somewhat bland. The miso soup was somewhat bland as well.  One thing that I was taken aback on was the rips and tears in the seat cushion at the booth I was seated in. It didn't help with the presentation of the restaurant. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant due to the worn furniture made this restaurant a borderline causal/divey place to me. This is not a place I would take a date to. Pricing for their entrees were reasonable. So if you are hungry and you don't care about the looks of a restaurant, this place would be suitable for a quick lunch.   Service was fine and they were able to serve the combination box to me in a timely manner. So the wait time to serve you food was quick. If you are short on time, you may want to try this place.    Parking at this restaurant is very easy. It is in a strip mall with ample parking. If I were short on time, and just wanted to eat something that was average, then you should give this place a try. But if you want to impress a date, you should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. I have recommended it to everyone of my friends. Who all have enjoyed going there. They have a great staff as well as great chefs. They are extemely friendly, and have great speed of service. The sushi is awesome, my favorite is the garlic tuna. I'm an addict, and would eat it everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Wife and I love sushi. Been to quite a few in vegas. This is our favorite so far, place is well lit and the food is great. Their live atmosphere is nice, open lay out, not too dim. Behind the sushi chefs there's a TV, usually playing sports not loud, so it's easy to have conversation without the tv drowning out ur conversation.  Down to the food, food is great all the rolls I've tried are good. Tiger roll is bomb. My fav. Tried the lisa lisa, and black jack plus like 10 others at the different times. AYCE is great plus ALL u can drink which is definitely a bonus. Overall this is fun laid back and I would highly recommend to anyone who likes sushi."}
{"text":"Service is awesome. The sushi is just OK. For AYCE, this place is on the high side of the price range. They really skimp on the portion size of the fish in the nigiri."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi and one of the better ones in northwest Las Vegas. Definitely regulars here and go during off hours like Monday and Tuesday for lunch because you will definitely get all the attention from the sushi chef."}
{"text":"Bad sushi, bad service. Uneven, and unflavorful rolls. All you can eat does not mean all you can eat, beware you will walk away with extra charges."}
{"text":"Never again. Just go to Smiths and get your own sushi. It took 30 minutes to get 8 pieces of sushi.  Felt uncomfortable and felt like we were bothering them.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had not been here for a while (about a month or so) and was anxious to get back and see Haru again.  Unfortunately, he was let go recently.  I loved Sushi Tachi in the past because Haru made everyone feel like you were a valued customer.  And while the wait staff is still very friendly, it is obvious that there is now something missing.  I am sure we will return, but with lowered expectations.  I certainly hope they hang on as we have enough empty strip mall properties in North Las Vegas...but I fear that what made this place EXCEPTIONAL is gone and we will now be looking to where Haru lands next.  In the mean time, I sugggest that they continue making Haru's exceptional roll creations..."}
{"text":"Glad we decided to eat here. Was craving sushi AYCE. This place is kind of small, but luckily it wasn't that busy. Good service, tasty sushi. Didn't care for the special rolls, but wasn't a problem. Our waitress took it away and didn't seem to mind. Would definitely go there to eat again!"}
{"text":"This was at one time a great ayce sushi place. Quality has gone away. Rolls are small and mainly overly wet rice. So sad."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, I introduced a bunch of my friends to this place but lately it's not been the Sushi Tachi I remember loving so much.  The last time I came, the rolls were kinda loose  and sloppy looking. It's like they didn't care how the food looked. To me food is visual, especially sushi so in my mind, it didn't taste as great as it once did when they payed attention to details.   I still love all their little small plates that come with the AYCE menu; especially the poke salad, seaweed salad, gyoza, shumai, fried oysters, shrimp tempura.   I really hope that it was just a bad day the last time I was here and not the standard of what this place has come to these days. It'll take me a while to make it back there to find out."}
{"text":"I love the quality of sushi here. They have a good selection, and the best baked rolls of anywhere I've been. The service is fast and just friendly enough. It is small in there, so the staff can easily keep an eye on you for when you need something, but they also seem to know when to leave you alone. Also, the restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The sushi was not fresh and not tasty at all. They also put something really spicy in a roll that was not described as spicy. I left 90% of my food on the plate. I would honestly rather have thrown $39 out of my window. Oh, and I didn't get every thing I ordered but was still charged for it. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Fast and fresh.  I've been coming here since the first week it opened years ago. My kids grew up eating here too. Its like a family go to spot even if they don't each sushi itself.   Specialty rolls change every week.  Quite a variety to eat, even though they don't carry a couple of items some other places carry.  You are always guaranteed a good meal from the nice size cuts of fish served.  Tasty desserts too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now since it's relatively close. My last experience was okay. The service was great, but the sushi was a bit underwhelming. In addition, it smelt like bleach when I walked in."}
{"text":"This our favorite sushi restaurant. Great lunch special and all you can eat sushi. The prices are very reasonable. Family friendly"}
{"text":"This is our usual spot for sushi. And is usually great. This time however , I was a bit disappointed. Different sushi guys make it different. Lately the sushi presentation was messy, falling apart and I actually had the rainbow roll that tasted fishy!!! And the rolls were messy and totally fell apart. I love comin here and it's close to home. But I'm gonna give it a break for  a minute so they can get their shit together. They are great and nice people.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch when it wasn't too busy. Service was quick and they were very friendly. The sushi was fresh and tasted amazing. My favorite sushi place by far. The green mussels are on of my favorites and so far no other place has come close to the mussels they serve."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for those of us who live in North Las Vegas.  We normally go to a place on the other side of town, but decided to try something closer to home.  We came in and were sat in a comfortable booth.  The ambience isn't awesome.  It definitely doesn't give you a cool vibe, but is a standard restaurant feel.  We had the AYCE option on the dinner menu that is $26.95 per person.  The appetizers are all really good and come in super small portions so that you are able to order several.  All of the rolls that we tried were great.  I recommend the Volcano #2 roll and the Black Jack roll.  We also saw that you could order sake shooters.  BEWARE--these are actually a shot with sake, quail eggs and orange fish eggs.  I was not able to eat it.  I guess I should have asked what this was, but it doesn't specify on the  menu.  Overall a pretty good place.  You only have a 60 minute time limit at dinner with AYCE and I was worried the whole time about being rushed.  The waiters didn't seem to push us, but I did see that they noted our arrival time on our receipt.  I think it is a decent place to grab some sushi."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I used to go to Yama Sushi on flamingo but this place is so much faster to seat you and friendlier staff! Plus you have to sit 10 inches from a person you don't know cause Yama sushi is small and crowded. Sushi tachi is my favorite place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"???????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Okay so I came.  I saw.  I Tachi'd and ummmmmm yah what are those four stars about?"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine a few years ago, I absolutely recommended to anyone. The food is good and the staff  is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is either going to be great or it's going to be quite an irritating experience depending what time you go. i have been there a few times in the duration of a few months usually on sat. around dinner. last night i went an hour and a half before last call it was great no one as pushing me to hurry up, service was great, and the food is adequate. I won't give up on this place it has so much potential i'll give it another go. Also if it's convenient i recommend sitting at the bar there is this sushi chef there who is simply just delightful to talk with if you are by yourself and he will take care of you, because of him this place gets 4 stars instead of 3"}
{"text":"Kaizen is great! Rolls are tasty and staff is very attentive :) the creme brûlée and green tea ice cream were my favorite"}
{"text":"Came back again to celebrate V-Day because we had such a good experience the first time we came. This time was a total disappointment. First off was the service they have signs all over putting a 60 minute time limit on the all you can eat. We waited 20 minutes just to order apperizers. Finally were served because the busser asked how we were. In all honesty she (the busser) had the best service in the place. Several things we ordered were forgotten and we had to ask where they were and were told they were still being cooked. (sure they were) As if the service wasn't a bad enough experience the sushi itself was nothing special.  I really wanted to tell management because this experience was not worth the $100 we are about to spend, but my husband does not like to cause any problems. We will just never be back. Please save yourself an expensive poor experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Japanese food.. Def. Gotta come to this place. I'm from  Japan  and I enjoy their food :)"}
{"text":"So the lady dropped of my tab and just by looking at it, I knew the items on my tab didn't add up to the total bill amount, by looking at the prices it was obvious that something didn't add up, so I pulled out my calculator, just to find out that I was over charged 8 bucks.... it was just me and my boyfriend therefore gratuity wouldn't be added to my bill nor was it noted on the bill that it was being added on, this was just someone not paying attention or rounding I'm not too sure but it's very frustrating to come across."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Never a long wait. Servers are easy to het a hold of."}
{"text":"If you're here to eat sushi with your friends and have a good time I wouldn't recommend you eat here because it's kinda dark and sad. I would recommend Tokyo Sushi for a fun up best place to eat with all you can eat. But over all the Service was decent at the beginning and slow at the end. Quick tip if you order something be sure to be exact on what you're ordering. Over all four stars."}
{"text":"Soo, my review for this shouldnt count toward whether or not you are debating to try the sushi. Why? I hate sushi! All I can tolerate eating is the su udon and cucumber salad. Soo yummy! Also the service is fantastic. Always greeted, seated right away and taken care of easily. One of the staff members reminds me of an asian patrick swayze. That has no significance to anything. Just thought id throw it out there!  Ps. The plum ice cream is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love Tachi! The AYCE with all you can drink Sake and Bud Light is def the way to go! Service is always excellent and the fish is fresh and delish! Love the Blackjack, Christina and Rainbow roll! If you are daring enough, try the spicy tuna 911 roll! I usually only get a half roll! It is pure fire! To bad Chef Paul doesn't work there anymore tho. He was always my favorite. Not quite sure what's up with the football jerseys as decoration but that's whatever! Lol"}
{"text":"Here you can get all the sushi you can eat for $24.99 and this includes your drink. They have a regular menu for people who are with those who love sushi but you might not. The sushi is actually pretty good. The service is excellent. Hey why not."}
{"text":"All you can drink sake with the AYCE? Yes, please.  So, I am a fan of another sushi place in town, but their appetizers aren't good.  Sushi Tachi has amazing appetizers, and decent rolls, but none stood out as spectacular.  The food was fresh, the service was good, but the rolls were very similar to the ones at various other places, and many were loaded with shrimp tempura or cream cheese or both--and I'm a fan of neither.  However, a solid buy for the money!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed! It wasn't fresh and the bar is high, the chairs are short. I've had better sushi this was not good. They didn't have a variety of great sushi, I've had better."}
{"text":"Cozy fast service even though the place was busy . We were attended on is if we were the only ones there .  Waitstaff   always very courteous and know when to strike up a conversation , perfect date night . Best  rainbow rolls"}
{"text":"I've tried food from this restaurant twice and I am just not impressed. The water tastes disgusting and I cannot figure out why because surrounding restaurants do not have this problem. Maybe they need a filter? Other than that I was not impressed with the sushi and would not eat it again. I also had a bento box that I would not get again. Everything lacked flavor and was more on the bland side."}
{"text":"Best place to get sushi! The staff is so friendly and prices are adorable. Rolls are fresh and not full of cream cheese filling or anything like at some places. The menu is large and prices are great. A must try if you're looking for sushi in NLV!"}
{"text":"So I just went here tonight with a friend and it was ok.   When we first walked in the place seemed to have decor that belonged in a sports bar. It was busy so we put our names down on the list. Sadly there were two chairs to be considered the waiting area and there was already a group of people so we had to wait outside in order not to get in the way of the entrance. The hostess barely looked us in the eye. I understand being busy but she could've taken a minute to compose herself.  We were seated after 20 minutes and the service was fairly quick. They took our drink orders and check in after 10 minutes to see if we were ready to order. I got the salmon dinner. It had Salmon filet with teriyaki sauce, 8 pieces of California roll, vegetable tempura, shrimp tempura, salad, and rice. The portions were big but there are some critiques I could give. The salmon was a bit dry, the seaweed on the California roll made it more chewy than one would want and the salad barely had any dressing. But other than those critiques the service was good and the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Seriously?! 4 stars? This place is disgusting with terrible service. First of all, I'm on a time limit of 1 hour.... TOO BAD IT TOOK 45 min to get my first order.... Secondly, the food was disgusting! Skimpy rolls with nothing in them. My sushi was literally room temperature because it had been sitting on the counter for 25 minutes!!! I saw our server twice the entire meal, and both times, get this!!! BROUGHT US SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD! I never saw half of the food that I ordered. I would have paid 62$ to take this whole experience back. Overall the worst experience for sushi I've ever had. I eat sushi 3-5 times a week and I doubt I will eat sushi again for a month. I'm completely disgusted. On my way out, excited to finally get my check, I noticed a HUGE chunk of hair covered in dust on the top of my booth... PUKE . Save yourselves from the worst experience of your life and avoid this place AT ALL COSTS!!!!! ( I wish yelp had negative stars ) PS yelp makes me give a star to post my review, like I said.... NEGATIVE"}
{"text":"Love the Sexy Girl roll!! It's so addicting. The sushi is fresh and the service is great. It's starting to become my favorite sushi spot on the North side of town."}
{"text":"Great food, cute environment. I love the all you can eat menu & the dessert.  The price is decent and is a great sushi location in the north Las Vegas area. I highly recommend if you're in the area"}
{"text":"So bomb! I ordered a-la-carte instead of AYCE because otherwise you can't take home leftovers! Lame. Anyway, dank sushi, sweet servers/chefs, cool vibes. Hella glad my friend showed me this spot! I wish I had known about it when I lived in vegas!!! Also, the menu items have hilarious names. Always a bonus. And the AYCE is also AYCD sake/beer!"}
{"text":"I'm stoked that a sushi place is near my house, fairly priced, and has a few of my favorite rolls. I used to frequent Sushi Tachi more during 2013. Things have changed for sure. Flavor, service, etc. but it's decent for this side of town. If this isn't your first pick for sushi, I'm not mad at ya, I agree! But if you find yourself on the north side of town and want some quick rolls without a long wait, stop by! They have tv on sometimes, variety of rolls, some waiters are really nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You can do AYCE & try allot of different roles! Came here in a group of 4 & tried 26 different half roles, nigiri & some tempura shrimp. So worth the food & the price!"}
{"text":"North Las Vegas is sushi challenged to say the least.  We have a sprinkling of establishments but none to write home about.  Sushi Tachi is our go to spot because it's close to home.  It's friendly, clean and the food is good.  We truly enjoy it!"}
{"text":"One of my managers recommended this place and ever since I've been coming back. It's pretty cool that on certain days not only it's ayce but it's aycd bud light and sake. Compared to the other ayce sushi places here in Vegas, this is the best one so far. My favorite is the volcano roll because it reminds me of my favorite sushi back in California that I would always get called, \"lion king\". It's not the same but it's close enough. They don't have any sort of roll like that here in Vegas and when I describe them what it is they just tell me to get a baked salmon roll but it's really not it. But anyways, they also have ramen here but I wouldn't really recommend it. I mean it's alright nothing special. I honestly feel like the only good thing here is just in their ayce sushi. However, you don't need to just get an ayce you can just do individual rolls. Oh and another thing I like about this place imo is that they have half rolls you can order so you don't get overwhelmed with getting a bigger/normal rolls. Service here is really friendly.. Or at least most of the time. I would have to say my favorite one is the girl with really short hair in sort of a pixie cut or boyish cut (sorry I didn't catch your name). I enjoy her the most just because she's really nice and I don't know I just get good vibes from her and I also like the way she talks lol. But one time I came there's this other girl who took our orders and I felt like she was being rude and so monotoned and just straight up giving me attitude as if she hated her job or something. Such bad vibes she was giving me to the point it kinda got me irritated lol. Well I'm going off on a tangent.. Anyways I would still come here regardless every time I'm in the mood for sushi or need to get my sushi fix on (which is probably once every week or two)."}
{"text":"Great place to dine. Hugh rolls... Everything was so DAM...Great   The all u can  eat includes beer Sunday through Thursday... Really to awesome."}
{"text":"Dinner is much better than lunch fish is fresher.  Service was great on both good place."}
{"text":"Had to add an update. Been there a ton of times, even had my birthday party with 8 ppl and it was great. Food is consistently amazing :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat, Yummm! The rolls were delicious and I love me some tempura ice cream. The service was a little slow but over all it was good. Definitely gonna make this my new go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about this place. The service is excellent and they're all so friendly. You can see that they all help each other out. Location is in a nice neighborhood (just outside of Aliante). The restaurant is modern and clean. The food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in North Las Vegas.  They have great reasonably priced lunch specials and the all you can eat deal.  We go here to celebrate occasions whenever possible.  The sushi is always great and the staff is super friendly.  The service is excellent.  Their rolls are excellent and they give you a good portion on the Nigiri sushi.  If you do the all you can eat meal be sure to order some of the hot items from the kitchen - my favorites are tempura, shumai, calamari, fired oyster, edamame, and gyoza.  The lunch specials are filling an all under $10.  Update:  Service has gone downhill.  Fish is not as fresh as it once was.  I don't know what changed, but I don't recognize anyone working there any more."}
{"text":"Ok. Time to write an update. Finally broke the spell and went back there. Tried to shut off my brain about the hair in my sushi last time and think about all the good stuff they have. I must say I'm very happy I did so. Staff there always makes you feel welcome, and service is consistently very good. They have fresh nigiris and the all you can drink bud light and saki from Sun - We. I'm glad we decided to give this place another chance, they will see us more often in there now.  We were just so done with sushi WOW and how they sometimes treated us. Would rather spend my money somewhere where they appreciate us."}
{"text":"Absolutely fell in LOVE with this place!  It's directly behind a Gold's gym and one day after working out I decided to finally GO IN here! It's all you can eat daily AND Drink beer/sake (Sun-Wed). WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!  They have a very nice and large menu, delicious selections, and a staff that is very friendly! I enjoyed my visit and plan to return on a weekly basis.   Note: the lunch buffet is limited to 45 mins and dinner to 60 mins, you must eat/drink all your food/beverages or risk being charged full price (per their signage and menu notations). BUT they do make half-rolls (4 pcs)!!!! Works out great for me!!!!!   I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good selection, good service at a reasonable price (was about 29.00 pp incl. tax; tip additional)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years, as it is close to Aliante! I can't speak for the AYCE sushi since we always have the dinner combo.  Personally, I like the salmon special and hubby always get their dinner special.  Glad to see that they have also expanded their menu to include curry and ramen.  Have to say that the food is definitely more 3 stars range but considering the price and quantity of food, I give it a solid 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Yep... sushi is damn good here! Waitresses are on point and make sure youre well fed if you do All You Can Eat!"}
{"text":"STILL the bomb. Loved it on 2014 and still do. Order the special! Every visit! I'm serious! How long do these reviews have to be? Okay, so, great service, great sushi, AYCE is a great deal. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure exactly but this place has disappointed me. My last actual Ayce visit before yesterday has been A while and things have changed alright. The friendly staff were still there and they had different chefs but i felt like they were going slow on purpose. I ordered side dishes and two of them were forgotten and the other arrived 20 minutes later. I used to love this place but it was just blahh. The quality of the fish is still one of the freshest i just dont feel its the same experience anymore and im saddened. Maybe it was just a slow lazy dayyyy."}
{"text":"Super Good.   Sushi Chef were super nice.   If you want something super spicy! get the 9-1-1 Roll!!! like OMG HOT HOT HOT HOT!  It says you can only eat for 60 minutes for all you can eat dinner, but we stayed there for like 2 hours and they didnt say anything. I think it just depends on how busy they are.  DONT FOLLOW  the map directions! it takes you to the wrong place. But the Address is Correct!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in an unexpected area of North Las Vegas. Best AYCE sushi for $26.95 (dinner) \"in North Las Vegas\" we've ever had. Their tuna, salmon, and yellow tail were all very fresh. We tried the 911 spicy tuna roll and it literally made us cry. Keep in mind, we're no whimps when it comes to spice. FYI, free all you can drink beer and sake on Mondays and Tuesdays with an AYCE purchase.  Make sure the waitress gets the order right, or else they bring you more food than you can eat ... which they will charge you for (they have a sign for that)."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Sushi Tachi for many years now and still believe it is one of the best all you can eat sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I've been more adventurous with my diet lately. Trying new foods and places to eat. Boyfriend and I made a deal to try at least two new places a month. So far, everything has been working out amazingly. Including Sushi Tachi.   Walking up, the word \"sushi \" in the sign looks worn out and I was worried that they were out of business. That wasn't the case.  We walked in and we're immediately greeted pleasantly. The girl had us seated quickly, it was quiet and slow with baseball on the TV behind the bar. She took our drinks and we signed up for AYCE. While waiting for our food, glancing around, the decorations are nice, it's pretty casual, seats aren't uncomfortable, and it's got a nice set up. Cosy but not cramped.   Boyfriend has devoured so much food. Nothing was bad. Although, I should have been more careful with my dairy intake. =P silly me.   The other waitress girl was super pleasant and very chatty with us. Boyfriend likes to chat, so that was a plus.   They weren't too pressuring about a time limit, possibly because it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Cheap but not great food. I like the all you can drink beer though. The waitress was a weirdo."}
{"text":"I Love Love This place. I have been coming here for almost 10 years. I love the family oriented environment. The attention to detail..and the servers are amazing and super friendly. I would recommend this place to everyone I know"}
{"text":"Still love coming here after all these years. Service and food are still great. I, for the life of me still don't get why people are complaining about the amount of rice (Bam S.). Seriously dude, if you wanted less rice and  sashimi, then eat at a place that specializes in sashimi. Octavio S. is pretty funny too. If you're going to bash a sushi restaurant over their dessert menu, then take your a** over to Baskin-Robbins. You act like you're paying a lot for an all-you-can-eat joint, bud. I wonder if you know you'd be paying more if you ate a la carte at any other restaurant. You're lucky they serve dessert at all. Green tea ice cream is enough for me considering the amount of sushi I'm eating.   In any case, this place is still one of my go-to sushi spots and I'm glad every time I come in that the staff always remains so friendly. Keep up the good work and don't let these fake food critics on yelp get to you."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Me and my best friend decided to give this place a try since our usual sushi place had a 30 minute wait time. Big mistake next time I will wait the 30 minutes.  First the host/waiter had horrible customer service. He was not friendly at all. We still decided to stay and put our first order in off the all you can eat menu. We ordered 6 things. The first 3 arrived and we started to eat. We ordered a roll called the chubby boy. It was not supposed to be spicy or have spicy tuna in it, but it did. When we asked the waiter about it he was unsure so called 2 other gentlemen to the table to stand and stare at it. After about 5 minutes they came to the conclusion that it wasn't spicy tuna and said it was crab meat mixed in yum yum sauce (still doesn't explain the spice and that roll wasn't supposed to have crab meat either)  Next our original waiter pretty much abandoned us so now we had a new waiter. He asked us if we wanted to order more and we told him we were still waiting for our other 3 items, but also ordered 2 more rolls. He said okay left and was back with the 2 new rolls. At this point we had already waited 40 minutes. We again asked him where our other items were and this time he asked us what the items were. We told him and he says \"Oh we gave those to another table because I wasn't sure who they belonged to. Do you want me to put the order in again?\" We told him no we just wanted the check. 15 minutes pass and no check. Then our original waiter comes back and ask if we wanted to order more. We told him no we just want our check then he says \"do you want some ice cream\" so we tell him no again.  This was the worst service I have ever had not to mention they did nothing to rectify their acknowledged mistakes. I understand things happen but at least try to correct them."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi spot. Decor could use some work; the football jerseys don't really fit, and the tv is small. All-you-can-eat is worth it. (non-budlight/saki drinks aren't included though) Great selection of sushi rolls, product is fresh too. Chef's are friendly and make great rolls. Been here several times, service can be slow at tables when they are busy."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food and kind people. This is better then Kaya in Chinatown. Cleaner, cooler, no wait, polite. I really enjoyed and will be back for the all you can eat again."}
{"text":"Going straight to it:)  My lunch AYCE for 24.95;Dragon Roll(8). September's Spicy Mango Roll(7). Puffy Roll(7). Spider Roll(9). American Dream Roll(10). Lisa Lisa Roll(10). Sushi Monster Roll(6). Mt Fuji Roll(7). Tootsie Roll(8) Tako app(9). Shrimp Tempura app(9). Baked Mussel app(6).  Their Red Bean, Green Tea, and Plum ice cream are unlimited with AYCE, but Mochi is one per customer and only available for dinner price. I guess what made up for the fourth star was the all you can drink Bud and Sake(warm).  Real clean atmosphere with jerseys on the wall for decor. Staff is friendly and pretty consistent on checking up on you."}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi is our usual go-to sushi place in town, even though it is 30 minutes away from us. The food is good, the service is pretty good, and they have free Bud Lights and sake Sunday through Wednesday with AYCE. Sometimes it can feel like the staff is judging you for how much you eat/order, but just power through it and get down with your bad self!"}
{"text":"Quick place to go to if you're craving for sushi. I got the tempura platter and it was really delish. It came with 5 tempura shrimp and several veggie tempura. I give them a five -star on their food. Place is decked with sport jerseys from famous athletes. What bothered me was the walls were filthy.  It looked like something was splattered on the walls and no one bothered to clean it or wiped it off.  And the booth chair was torn.  No matter how great the food is, if the place is trashed, it's not worth going to."}
{"text":"Came here around 7pm, there was a 30-45 min wait so we decided to go to the bar! this place was packed!! Was a lil annoyed w the wait time to place an order but giving that it was very busy I understood. As far as the sushi, they had a variety of rolls but not a lot in terms of cooked rolls ( or at least ones I was interested in). The rolls were decent, the staff was slow but nice. However, nothing wowed me  about this place to be completely honest.."}
{"text":"Super yummy, good service.  AYCE had a nice extensive menu--well worth the price in my opinion.  And beer/saki is included for their AYCE menu Sun-Wed!  I used to live in this area and never realized how much I loved this place until it was farther for me to get to and I had to start trying other places.  Let's just say they don't compare :-) Will definitely be taking the time to drive out here and start hitting it up more often."}
{"text":"Forget the negative reviews you have seen.  This place is great!!  Great food, great service and their \"all you can eat\" menu is awesome.  No frills or fancy decor, just a great place to dine.  Was there on Valentines day and all the servers had smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"Super easy to order takeout and the food is always ready on time!!.. i ordered the flying Jason roll recently and it was sooo delicious."}
{"text":"The sushi was great! The cucumber salad, however, was not great. It tasted as it looked - like shredded cucumber, without any marination or vinaigrette. The servers were polite and attentive. However, when I asked that a roll be changed to a hand roll - I was told they could not do it, despite my willingness to pay extra for what I wanted. I was also unimpressed that they only offer frequent buyers club stamps to customers purchasing their all-you-can-eat option. I paid twice as much, and they wouldn't even offer one stamp. Four stars for food. Two stars for pleasing the customer. Sadly, that makes it a 3."}
{"text":"At a glance, the menu is creative & the all you can eat looks enticing. But we came in in a relatively large group & my fiancé did not receive her first roll until an hour after she ordered it. Most of our party also had large waits as well. The taste was fair to average, nothing to complain about, but there are better tasting sushi restaurants in the valley. A manager was extremely nice & tried to help out, but an auto-gratuity on the check was definitely in bad form after the very poor service."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. Went in there on a Friday night at 5 and was seated right away. Glad we came in when we did because it got packed shortly after. The restaurant is fairly small. Seats maybe 50 people plus the sushi bar. But that wasnt an issue. The service was SPOT ON and the sushi was GREAT. Completely pleased with the service, staff, and food. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Damn I love Las Vegas and your all-you-can-eat sushi joints!  Why can't we do this in San Diego?  My cousin took me here during my recent visit to Vegas, and it was great.  They give you 60 minutes to order whatever you want on their AYCE sushi menu, which is almost everything.  They don't really time you though.  My cousin and I were there for over an hour and no one said a word  He even told me that he and his family were there once for over three hours and they kept on serving them.  Sunday-Thursday are also all-you-can-drink Bud Light and sake nights included in the $26.95 price.  The fish is very good quality and they don't skimp on the amount of fish in the nigiri or the rolls, which is awesome.  The sushi chefs and waiters are friendly although a little slow.  It's a good thing that they're not sticklers on the 60-minute time limit.  I'm definitely hitting this place up again during my next visit.  The more money I spend on sushi, the less I have to lose at the blackjack table."}
{"text":"First time I came here for dinner I loved it. Service was great, the rolls were fantastic. Fast forward one year later, visited again from Seattle for lunch and brought our friends. So disappointing. Horrible service from the moment we walked in. The rolls were not as memorable or unique as before, the execution of the rolls was not as beautiful or out of the ordinary. Was embarrassed we brought our friends to this place because the service was so bad... and we drove up from the strip. The shadiest part of our experience was the server adding her 18% gratuity on the post tax total. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi and great service. A bit pricey but will return because of the quality sushi and service"}
{"text":"I'm an avid sushi eater and this place is a hole in the wall that you DO NOT want to spend your money on. Got the all you can eat for an hour. The waitress was an older Filipino lady who seemed really bothered to take our order. She came around twice and we never saw her again. We couldn't even utilize the all you can eat because no one was around and we weren't the only ones complaining that night.We said f-it and left. Went to complain and the guy that took our money couldn't speak English. There are way better sushi spots in Vegas. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Can't beat the all you can eat all you can drink Sunday - Wednesday for only $25! Very clean and can get busy on the all you can drink nights. The service is good, but the food is what keeps me as a customer. We go there about 4 or more times a month. Definitely recommended it to friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The staff really stay on top of things. As soon as we arrive and are seated there is no hesitation to get to our drinks and order. The sushi  selection is always good! Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"This place is \"okay\" not bad!!   Dinning area: ugly  Hygiene: Poor  Service: Good  Food: Great   Platting: Awesome   And that's all I have to say about that:)!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was really good but the sushi was god awful. The mackerel was barely edible (old). I ordered albacore (bincho maguro) and they soaked it in ponzu - nigiri. What? The salmon was fine. The hamachi was good. The eel tasted old. The snow crab (did you mean no crab?) was mostly Panko (Bread crumbs) and WAS NOT nigiri, it was a poorly wrapped Gunkan roll. It was just so off in execution I was really put off. The fish was not fresh. I did get a couple rolls and they were okay. They didn't overdo it on the rice ratio which is a common tactic but I just really was disappointed in general and frankly if I get sick I'm not going to be all that shocked."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Umiya sushi this place doesn't compare. At first I thought maybe we just ordered a few bad rolls but as we kept ordering from the all you can eat menu it wasn't getting any better. Was really flavorless and I'm pretty sure that batch of albacore they had was bad. The price is about the same as Umiya on Flamingo but their stuff is worth the money if you don't mind the drive. As with any restaurant there will be good and bad staff. Our initial waitress was impatient but I think her shift was up anyway. Our second waitress was much better."}
{"text":"Found hair - white animal-type not human hair in my food and when I told the server/cashier he was like \"oh sorry about that\"...Really. I have NO PETS for that reason so I didn't bring it in with me. Gross! Only gave one star cuz I had to. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place ! Nice atmosphere small business ! Customer service was excellent , every employee was knowledgable ! The mussels && green tea ice cream are AMAZING . The pricing isn't bad at all ! Especially the all you can eat menu with sake && beer . Nd it doesn't hurt that I love sushi nd everything is fresh && tasty"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here more than a handful of times. Whenever family and friends are in town, we bring them here too and they love it. We always opt to do AYCE, so I can't really say much about the a la carte menu, except that you, obviously, probably get more bang for your buck with AYCE. We like to get the usual favs, seaweed salad, miso soup, green mussels, and shrimp tempura (always hot, fresh, and crispy). They have a monthly special roll as well, which is nice if you're wanting to venture off the usual fare. If you're not sure about a particular roll, you can order half a roll to lessen any waste. Service is nice and friendly and is always ready to take orders. If it's a busy night and you have a large group, do expect to wait because this restaurant isn't that huge. If you become a fan of this place, they have a stamp card for every time you do AYCE. If you happen to come in for AYCE lunch, there are a few selections on the AYCE dinner menu that aren't available during lunchtime, but you can do the AYCE dinner menu for a few dollars more. Like to have beer or sake with your sushi? Well, Bud Light and sake are included with AYCE from Sunday through Wednesday. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I went to sushi tachi on monday for my birthday. I had never been there before. Well to my surprise not only did they have all you can eat but that same price also included all you can drink hot sake and bud light. The sushi was good and the service was great. The only downfall was that my bf couldn't find a sushi roll spicy enough. But since I don't care for spice ;) I'm giving them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people hate on this place! This is the best sushi place ever. Service is fast and all the servers are nice and beautiful! My favorite roll there is the tuna lover's ! I highly recommend eat here!!"}
{"text":"It's not the best sushi place, but for North Las Vegas, it's pretty good. You can't check in using your iphone yelp, because the address it maps is way off base. It's actually located on the corner of Centennial and Simmons/Aliante. If we didn't live in Aliante, we probably wouldn't make a special trip to come here. There was a sign that they will have all you can eat and drink (bud light and sake) starting in May, which is a big draw for my husband.  The menu has a good variety and I'm able to get udon for my daughter while my husband and I enjoy the all you can eat sushi. The hamachi collar and amaebi are really good. I loved the Salmon Skin hand roll too. The uni was gross, but that's what's expected from all you can eat places I guess. The service was fine and they seemed to keep a good pace even though it was pretty busy. We went about 6:30pm and it was packed, but at 7:30pm, it was dead."}
{"text":"Always love this place!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever!! Only reason I still come here is because the sushi is so good. But the service pisses me off every time. They forget to bring out wasabi every time. Slow to check up on us. I'd give it a single star but the sushi is the only thing saving it."}
{"text":"This has become my standard sushi restaurant here in North Las Vegas. The people who run it are friendly, the service is solid, and the sushi is pretty good and reasonably priced.  They have nice lunch specials, and the All You Can Eat is a good time too for when you really feel like stuffing your face hard. :)  I wish they had a little more variety with their rolls, though. It feels like half the menu involved spicy tuna and there's only so much spicy tuna this girl can take."}
{"text":"This is far and away my favorite sushi place. After my favorite sushi Chef left a couple of years ago but they did not miss a step. My only regular restaurant in Las Vegas. The owner is amazing. The staff is on point. Love it all!"}
{"text":"Great place, I saw it while passing by. Wonderful place to bring a date or to sit down for lunch at the bar. Large menu selection for that WI keep you coming back for more. We'll priced so you won't break the bank. They also have an all you can menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Unwound have not give this place any star.... I was hair here and about to get lunch, the door was open.   3 mins before the \"actually\" open the waitress ask me if I can wait outside the restaurant..... Are you kidding me!!!!!? I'll take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love love love! My favorite sushi place up in North Vegas. Fast service and friendly staff. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Sushi Mon, same owner, same great sushi, my all time favorite for all you can eat sushi, which was introduced to me by a japanese family. It is the real deal. Fresh sushi lots of protein, good service and if you are a  all-you-can-eat regular don't forget to ask for the stamp card for your free dinner. I am so happy they opened in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good service and quality sushi, only issue is that it is a little bit more expensive than other AYCE places ($25 for lunch).  Also, the location on the Yelp map is waaayyy off, use Google Maps if you want to find the correct location."}
{"text":"Very good sushi! Lots of options. I enjoyed it with my husband! The salad sauce is really good and my husband doesn't like salad that's much and he ate it! Service was a little slow we kept waiting for someone to come or pass by but none the less it was good and the waiters very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I have never seen lemon on top of the salmon, but it was refreshing and tasty. I usually order tiger roll at Japanese sushi restaurant I can't believe this is all you can eat quality sushi roll because it was delicious -!!;) I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just not really impressed. Nothing really seemed fresh. Received a really poor cut of mackerel, mostly the skin. Edamame didn't come out very hot. Seaweed salad and cucumber salad were incredibly plain.   The server was very friendly and attentive, which is the only positive thing I have to say. Right down the street but won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of the Tachi for years now.  We use their frequent diner card and have gotten several all-you-can-eats for free.  Some rolls that are our favorites: New York Girl in Vegas Salmon Delight American Dream Tiger Moon River Spider  LOVE this place!!!  Highly recommend it!  Fresh every time."}
{"text":"The sushi here is GREAT!!!  I can't even recommend ONE roll because I've had SO many good ones. If you're a light eater, but you want to try 2 different rolls and pay for one.. they have half rolls for half the price!!  The sushi chefs are always very friendly, and I always have good service when I come here.  Their all you can eat menu seems like an awesome deal, unfortunately I haven't done it yet, but I am looking forward to trying it out one evening!!  Definitely TRY THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and wife for all u can eat. Although the sushi is good, you wait FOREVER!! Ordered 4 different types of nigiri and it took multiple reminders and an 1 hr later to get just 2 of them. It wasnt until we spoke to a manager, that our order was completed."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp. Decided to do the All you can eat sushi bar for 26$ and some change. Sunday - Thursday it includes all you can drink budlight or house sake. Plus they take your order and make it for you fresh . The only catch is you have one hour to eat everything you ordered .. Anything left over they will charge you for. Since we went in a group of two females that was a bit intimidating and the only reason I didn't give five stars. I understand the desire to not waste food but without a actual timer you're on the edge of your table the whole meal. It seems to me they may be a bit relaxed about it.  Our service was Awesome.. Our server was helpful and friendly but everyone working was really nice . A server named David really stood out. He was engaging and friendly and very happy to help!! He even gave me the kiddie chopstick helpers since I'm fail.   For the money spent we got tons of food from Tempura, Gyoza to Sushi rolls and even delicious green tea ice cream at the end. It was a really good time !"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I think the quality has gone down a bit in the past few years. If you like okay sushi at a great price this is your place. If you want great sushi, maybe try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Sushi masters know how to prepare stuff on and off the menu.  I suggest sitting at the sushi bar so you can ask them to make you something special.. they usually do and it's good. I will be coming here again soon"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great as I come here often. Everytime I get the AYCE. The service is always nice and friendly! I love their seared salmon. I would definitely recommend all sushi lovers to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 in my opinion. Just got home from this restaurant. Ate during lunch time.  The two waiters i had were very nice and helpful when i asked questions. It was my first time eating there. I decided to go with my brother since the place is near my house. We got AYCE sushi. The inside looked really nice and clean.  The lunch was $24.95 (45 mins) Dinner is $26.95 (60 mins)  I really didn't like their price for the lunch and their time limit. There are so many other places that have their AYCE lunch cheaper and with 60 mins, not 45 mins :P  The sushi was good though. Fish tasted fresh enough for my taste. Their baked sushi's tasted really good also. Since i'm a HUGE baked muscle fanatic, i tried their's and it was only \"bleh, ok.\" I was realy disappointed at that.  My brother ordered his last roll and he had to wait for a long time because the chief's didn't make it for some reason. So he asked our waiter what happened and she went to go make sure that he got it as soon as possible. So we were glad at how nice and apologentic they were.   For dessert, they only offer the normal ice cream for lunch. Therefore, the mochi and tempura ice cream is only for dinner. I was disappointed about that as well :P  ~Overall: the place was \"ok.\" Great service.  Good food, but definitely had better with a cheaper price. Horibble price for lunch, considering the time limit all the things that are not available."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!  The chef, once figuring out our group's tastes, surprised us with one delicious roll after another.  My personal favorite was the rolls topped with thin lemon slices."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in town. The all you can eat and drink is a great value."}
{"text":"This is always a great go to place for me and my family, especially it being so close to where they live.  AYCE (and drink sake or budlight sun-wed) with competetive pricing  great selection of rolls food sides and more, the service used to be amazing here, a go to place I would always bring friends and family to...however the last few times I've gone.. it's been over crowded with slow service, or we were given attitude from start to end of the dining experience from our waitress. Used to be regulars, at least dine every month.. but how I'm treated when giving a place business means a lot, time for another place."}
{"text":"Pretty good for all you can eat. DO NOT order the Lasagna Roll! Fuuuuuuuuuh!!!"}
{"text":"I heard this was a great place so I Tried it. The all you can eat menu was great but I give this place gets 2 stars because customer service sucked. Most all you can eat places ensure to keep coming back knowing you want to keep ordering as you go. But I waited forever to get refills and order! I was more annoyed than anything. Our server kept going to the hostess stand to talk to the employees... While I'm waiting! Too bad this place has great food but not worth the customer service."}
{"text":"Really good nigiri. Cold, fresh, and topped with just the right amount of sauce. Crunch roll is delicious."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the service is horrible!  Sushi is good but nothing too great.    Look around the workers look like they \"love\" (facetious) their job! It seemed like it was all the workers that night...  Just few things that happened with customer service during our last visit that I don't think we'll go back.   It's too bad cause they are close to our home but if we're going to drop close to a Bill at this place they need to be a little more excited & on top of their game with their service to their guests.    Sushi gave the extra star or I would have kept this at a 1 star.   Oh on side note: our son is 3.5yrs but he's big for his age. Looks like he can be 5. They use height to determine if they charge kids.  Needless to say he was slightly above height so they charged us. He barely eats... maybe few pieces of a roll & eats edamames. I tried to plea with them about that issue but they didn't bug.  Too bad. So many sushi places in town. Little more of a drive but worth us driving to feel comfortable & happy customers.   Show your guests you care & we'd consider coming back."}
{"text":"I would actually give it 3.5 stars but I rounded up for a couple of reasons.  The service was very friendly and efficient, and I really like the half-roll options.  I think another reviewer said that this place was kind of the Panda Express of sushi.  I would agree with that.  It is good, but not originally great."}
{"text":"So this may sound a little exaggerated however it is not. We went out to eat at Sushi Tachi tonight and my husband went against his better judgement. We (daughter and I) love this restaurant and hubby just doesn't care for Sushi like we do so he planned to have something different. We were all happy.  When we arrive, the restaurant is full and there are several people waiting for tables. We decided we would sit at the bar because we have never sat at the bar before. Everything is going well and my daughter and I ordered our second roll and my hubby is eating his teriyaki chicken bowl. The Chef hands me my 2nd roll and my husband taps me on the arm and shows me a screw he had in his mouth after a bite of his food. It looked like a screw from the wok handle. So we call the waitress over and she takes the food away and gets her manager. Now my stomach is upset and I delayed starting on my roll. My daughter asked the chef for something else and he looked up at us and snot dripped from his nose down to the Sushi prep board where he was making rolls. I about died right there. My daughter and I looked at each other in shock and I said \"aw hell nah\" and stood up walked to the front and told the cashier we are not eating the sushi or paying for the food my husband didn't get to eat. Then I told him about the snotty chef. He apologized profusely and still charged me $35. I will never eat there again and it will be a loooooong time before I have sushi or food that others prepare for that matter."}
{"text":"Great local spot for all you can eat sushi. We've been going here for over 10 years & the place hasn't changed one bit which is great. The service & employees have always been excellent. They also offer sake & bud light w/the all you can eat. I also enjoy the miso soup esp during a cold winter night."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Wife and I shared the sushi dinner for two -$25 Cooper helped us eat ours and (and he ate his) we could hardly finish ours.  Price is awesome."}
{"text":"Sunday-Wednesday for $26.95 you get AYCE along w/ AYCD Hot Sake & Bud Light.  Do I REALLY need to say more???  Ok - you twisted my arm.  The meal was fabulous - the appetizers (I love green oysters), the rolls, the sake - everything was worth every penny.  My new \"go to\" rolls - Ay chi chi (this roll has habanero sauce on it!) and any of the rolls w/ sliced lemon on them.  They do an incredibly thin slice of lemon - the slight hint of citrus really add something special that I haven't experienced at other sushi restaurants.  This is a bit out of the way for us, but again, we enjoyed the food so much we will definitely be back again...I'm not sure you can beat the value anywhere else in Vegas.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service could have been a little more attentive.  All of the servers seem to share all of the tables - which I guess in theory is great, but in practice I think they lose track of what tables they've attended to and which ones they haven't.  We did have to flag them down a few times to fill waters, sakes, and order more rolls."}
{"text":"I don't know if my expectations where just too high, but I wasn't really blown away by this place, but I liked it.  It was a decent meal (had the salmon special) and the food was all good and we definitely were satisfied with our meal. The one thing that I didn't love was that I found the service kind of sloppy... although we did arrive just after a dinner rush on a Friday night, so I'll give them that.  Just to note, I'm not a local N. Las Vegas-er, I'm originally for Toronto and now live in NYC, so I'm also a bit spoiled when it comes to Japanese.  We were on vacation, staying in the area, so we decided to check it out based on Yelp reviews.  I would 100% go back and recommend it others looking for decent Japanese in N. Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tachi is a delightful all-you-can-eat sushi bar & restaurant.  The Kassandra roll is a particular highlight if you enjoy yellowtail, and if you like a nice seafood medley I recommend the Sunrise roll. The all-you-can-drink hot sake or Bud Light (Sunday - Wednesday) is a perfect counterpoint to the fish.   Service is generally quick, though if the house is full you may experience a brief wait for your first set of rolls. Our server Jamie was attentive, polite, and pleasant. We strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone in town who wants lots of good sushi without the hassle of dealing with the Strip."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town, plus they have all you can eat. So you get all you can eat of the best sushi in town for a great price. I will not go to another sushi place. Just saying."}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi...what happened??  You used to be one of my favorite AYCE spots in town...and definitely the best place in the North to get my fix!  Most of the nigiri was good, but there were some cuts that were boring and slightly stale, and others that were completely falling apart! Some of the cuts were so thin that they were literally ripping apart off the rice without me touching it! Maybe it is a newer chef, or maybe they need to sharpen their knives....Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tachi-north-las-vegas?select=oMnMM29bSkwcsK7hv_PCPQ#oMnMM29bSkwcsK7hv_PCPQ  I didn't even take a pic of the Unagi because I was embarrassed for them...presentation wise, and the flavor and consistency was not there. I would say it was the worst Unagi I've had, and I am fairly easy to please.  Not all of it was bad though.  The salmon rolls and sake nigiri tasted good, as well as a few other cuts of fish.  But nothing really stood out or made a statement.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tachi-north-las-vegas?select=nKhIP82ww3Gp16U6uBgYXg#nKhIP82ww3Gp16U6uBgYXg  Service was also slow on parts...we ordered the Amaebi with fried shrimp heads, but we never received the heads. Since we were getting full, we never brought it up to them. We all ordered dessert, ate dessert, got the bill...and paid. Then the shrimp heads came out LOL.  Amaebi : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tachi-north-las-vegas?select=esR6TXBJwPtJXmlispBj7Q#esR6TXBJwPtJXmlispBj7Q  Finished off with some tempura ice cream : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-tachi-north-las-vegas?select=c7IPzJpOtnUa2JqQ-LlnWw#c7IPzJpOtnUa2JqQ-LlnWw  I won't try to steer you away from Tachi, but I can't recommend it to anyone anymore! Drive farther in town to get something better!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years now and with good reason. The fish is always fresh and of high quality, as are all of the other ingredients. Even the sushi rice is on point in terms of taste and texture. My favorite rolls are the vegetarian roll, the New York Girl in Vegas sans cream cheese and light mayo and the Gone With the Wind has crispy salmon skin (which I love). Hand rolls and nigiri are also fantastic- I love the tuna, salmon, red snapper and uni... Although you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. Sunday through Wednesday is also all you can drink Bud Light and House sake with regular AYCE sushi. It's been 5+ years since my first trip here. I've tried other places around the valley, but this is it for me on the Northside!   PRO TIP: The 911 roll is actually extremely hot; they are not over-exaggerating!   PRO TIP 2: ALWAYS TRY THE EVER-CHANGING MONTHLY SPECIAL!   PRO TIP 3: Don't forget to grab a stamp card if you're a first timer- I promise, you will be back. And if you forget yours, they will start you a new one and combine it with the other.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bunk sushi spot. Mushy rice and taste like it's been sitting long. All served on a chipped plate. This place needs to lose a few stars."}
{"text":"This is my #1 go to sushi restaurant so far in Vegas. AYCE is the golden path. Recommended rolls Spider, Lisa Lisa, Monster, and various others 2 many 2 list! Might have a wait time, restaurant isn't that big, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place in vegas. The service is always great, and our server is always so nice . Christy ann , and joy are always so helpful and patient when we order. They always recommend new and different things from our regular , \"dinner special\". I recommend the dragon roll, tiger roll, shrimp tempura roll and most definiteley the tempura ice cream...(deep-fried ice-cream). Overall its a great place to come dine with friends or family! I absoluteley love it!"}
{"text":"This place is going down hill! My wife and I used to frequent it as one of the better all you can eat sushi places in vegas.  The waitress took my wife's order wrong and then got mad and tried to force her to eat it anyway! She has been ignoring us for the past 20 min as we have been trying to order more, so much for all you can eat!  Do your self a favor and try yama sushi or sushi kaya!  They have better sushi and way better service even on their busiest night! For 70$ a couple, spend the extra gas and drive to yama sushi or sushi kaya!  Best two places to eat in vegas!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because I was in the area. Way too much rice on my rolls and nigiri. Everything tasted bland.  I'll stick to Sushi Neko or Yama Sushi in China Town for my go to spots."}
{"text":"This is the bast sushi restaurant in town. I came here very regularly. Staff and chef are all.friendly. their sushi rice is small but fish is big. Which I.love it so.much. I don't want to be filled by the rice.  Food are very fresh. Chef told us their fish are freah cut everyday. I never has problem foe eating there. Price is very good. Espeiclaly whenbyou came in Sunday to Wed. They also have all you can.drink. beer sake. All free @@"}
{"text":"I don't think I'd return to this venue.  Although it's one of a few sushi restaurants in the area, I'd rather travel a little further for decent sushi.  Everything, from the nigiri to the hand rolls to the long rolls, were served with way too much rice.  And they specifically state on the menu that you'll be charged for any food leftover on your plate.  The Cajun albacore was so not edible that I hid the other nigiri piece in a napkin for fear of being charged for it.  The spicy scallop yum yum hand roll was not yummy at all and only had a few pieces of scallop tucked inside.  When I saw it, I thought they had mistakenly given me a California hand roll.  My dad really liked his tempura udon so we may go back for the non-sushi food items."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the service. Slow when busy, slow when I was one of 5 other diners. Maybe disorganized is a better word. The food is really excellent though, very fresh and reasonably priced. Worth the wait if you plan accordingly. If you like plum wine, theirs is excellent."}
{"text":"All you can eat is mediocre to poor at best, but the service is good and the all you can drink bud light is awesome."}
{"text":"friendly neighborhood sushi place. great lil spot. well priced. try the baked 702 and the white tuna. sun-Wed. includes bud light and sake! my new sushi place"}
{"text":"Not sure why they have 5 stars. Not sure why they have 2 business listings with 2 different addresses when there's only 1 Tachi.   I've been coming to Tachi for years since this place is close to home. The quality has declined over the years. We would normally do AYCE but they also have a regular menu to order from.  Miso Soup: This is not the version that's made with love.  The soup is pre-made and the tofu pieces are so tiny. 1/5  Sushi/Sashimi: Sashimi isn't included in AYCE. AYCE is about $24-26/person. Or you can get sushi/sashimi combo starting at $10. The quality of fish is inconsistent. Sometimes the fish looks like it was cut using a butter knife. Sometimes the fish is ice-cold. 2.5/5  Shumai: You can get these balls fried or steamed. Shumai is meant to be dipped in soy/ponzu sauce but they don't give you sauce here. 3/5  Donburi: Katsudon, raw egg on top of rice with hot broth. The hot broth cooks the raw egg so mix it all up as soon as the bowl touches your table. This is a good dish, however, when my sister ordered this the last time, it lacked flavor. They were not busy at all the last time we went so there's no excuse. Another inconsistency? 3/5  Since the location is convenient and sometimes we just don't want to drive 10 miles to get good AYCE, I guess we will continue to come here and keep hoping we catch them on a good day."}
{"text":"I first started coming here 5 years ago and have watched them gain in popularity. They have a wonderful selection of rolls, nigiri, and appetizers included on the all you can eat menu.   The only drawback for me, is I now have to go during the off hours. Dinner and lunch times they are very busy but worth the wait if you must!  They are quick and efficient anytime."}
{"text":"Food was great, moon roll, American dream roll and the oh! Philly roll were very good. The calamari was good. Service was fast we'd go again"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in North  Vegas.  Even my 4 year old loves it too. She had me take her 2 days in a roll for her kids chicken teriyaki with California rolls, she finishes almost everything.  For me my favorite is the Sexygirl rolls. Great place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Shame on you Sushi Tachi for charging my 68 lb 10 year old the same price you charged me for AYCE sushi. Nevermind the fact that $24.95 for lunch is by far the highest priced AYCE in the valley, how can you legitimately charge children prices based on their height? My 10 year old is tall for her age but she's very thin and eats like a bird. My 8 year old out-weighs her by 7 lbs. Unfortunately the pricing wasn't the only issue with our lunch here this past Sunday. For starters the service was sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooww. By slow I mean we ordered 4 rolls as soon as we sat down and didn't get one of the rolls til literally 45 minutes later. We ordered 2 volcano rolls (the kids love them), the waiter held up 2 fingers and verified we wanted 2 volcano rolls, yet we received a Volcano Roll #2 which is practically nothing like the regular volcano roll and has cooked salmon on the inside and outside. Some rolls we had to order twice because they simply never came. This is unacceptable service for a $25 pp meal. They seriously need to hire more people, 2 servers and 2 sushi chefs is clearly not enough for the small crowd on a Sunday afternoon. I overheard one server apologizing to the table beside us when we walked in so I'm sure we weren't the only disgruntled patrons. Good bye Sushi Tachi!"}
{"text":"I ate at SUSHI TACHI on Sunday with my friends, a party of six.  At first they were going to charge my 2 year old child a kid's meal...I mean common now, what 2 year old eats a lot.  All of us ordered all you can eat, a total of 6.  We asked for a seperate check my husband and I.  After our meal, they charged us 18% gratuity because we came in all together.  I complained about it because we did ask for seperate checks in the beginning.  Then the waitress said \" but I didn't charge you for your daugther\"...Oh that got me upset because her including the gratuity on my tab shouldn't have to justify my daughter not being charged.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cheap person, I would've tipped but for her to include my daughter in the situation was wrong.  I felt like they weren't trying to resolve the situation but only make it worst.  I replied back by saying \"go ahead charge my daughter then\"....They changed the bill & charged me for my daughter $7.95.  I looked at the kid's menu and it was the most expensive item on there.  My daughter ate 2 sushi's & green tee ice cream.  I've eaten at other sushi restaurants and NOT ONE OF THEM charged me for my 2 year old daughter.  Very disappointed!!!!  Sushi was okay but SUSHI MON's is the best."}
{"text":"What's not to love, it's our neighborhood joint. The sushi is good, the service is always consistent and good, sometimes they mix up the orders but then you get to try something new :).  Good solid place to eat sushi, drink beer and watch sports."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 Price 4/5 Service 1/5  Gave it another try almost a year later....drinks weren't refilled we had to keep asking.  To go box was forgotten we had to ask twice...never once asked if we were doing ok....just plain bad service!  Food was good and good portion for price but if you like courteous service and friendly staff you are out of luck at this place.  Couple who walked in while I was waiting to pay walked out because no one helped them.  Nuff said...."}
{"text":"When I lived in Aliante for five years, this was my go to spot for AYCE. Every year I always came close to letting my frequent card for a free meal expire. So doing the gorilla math, I was averaging just under a visit per month at Sushi Tachi. This place always had me coming back for more. The occasion for my most recent visit was to have dinner with my family that lives on the north side of town.  We actually waited 30 minutes at 7:30 to be seated on a Wednesday night, so the place does get pretty busy. Ten minutes of the wait we were just waiting for the table to be bused. I would always recommend sitting at the sushi bar because the chefs are friendly and give you good service but since we had a party of five we wanted a table. We had an enjoyable visit once we were sat.  I had the AYCE of course and had no complaints except for the uni. It was on the brownish side. The value comes with the Bud Light and sake. I also always down a sake shooter and have an order of amaebi with every visit. One bonus is they have halibut which is not guaranteed to be found on every sushi menu.  A couple dinner boxes of chicken teriyaki were also ordered at the table and for around $11, you get your money's worth: miso soup, salad, chicken, full California roll, and large size order of tempura.  Although I don't come often enough to fill a frequent card anymore, Sushi Tachi still remains a reliable place to have AYCE."}
{"text":"My brother brought me here for an early mother's day lunch yesterday. We were seated right away. At the time we arrived there wasn't much customer's. Service was okay, although I think our server could have spoken a little nicer and have more knowledge of the items on the menu.  I am from Maui visiting family here and I was not impressed with the food presentation or the taste of most of the items I ordered. I was so excited to try this restaurant and so bummed it wasn't a great experience for me."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS. If a Negative star was offered I'd use it. First the service is very slow and these guys forgot protions of our order which we never received so our service gets a - 2 stars. Bathrooms are very dirty, floors are wet with many discarded paper towels on the floor. This gets the same -2 stars. All you can eat is not a great value. After waiting 15 minuted between food requests seemed excessive but consider if you exceed the 1 hour limit on the all you can eat means you dont get your fill. So overall,-2 stars and i will not come back."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here the sushi is good ,but the service is not very great. The servers are sometimes rude and don't check back for at least 15 minutes. I went without getting a refill for 15 minutes.This place was one of my favorites but since the last time I went it seems like the service went downhill."}
{"text":"Some days I just don't feel like driving far, but at the same time I don't want to cook.  Sushi Tachi is one of those limited restaurants in Aliante that I will go to.  I had been here once for their lunch special, so I decided to give it a try for dinner.  The value for food is good, for $10.95 you get teriyaki chicken, shrimp/vegetable tempura, california roll, miso soup, rice, cucumber salad, green salad.  This isn't the best food, but probably the best in this area.  I left extremely full and satisfied.  This place was relatively packed on a Friday night, so I'm guessing it's the go to spot for a lot of AYCE fans up north.  I would definitely return here for cheap meal, especially with the limited options in Aliante."}
{"text":"Great sushi, cool clean restaurant.NFL jerseys. Good food. All you can eat and drink sunday- Wednesday."}
{"text":"We used to come here a bit when they first joined the neighborood. As th le family grew, we kinda stopped coming. I will say, however, I would still get something to-go a few times during each pregnancy for these specific items: mixed green salad, oh! Philly roll, and their vegetable tempura. DONE. Made the belly happy.  I always loved their Oh! Philly roll. It is basically a cut roll of seaweed and rice, with salmon and cream cheese in the middle, then tempura fried.   The dressing they use for the mixed green salad is something I wish I had a big tub of because I would gladly drench, scoop, dip, my salad into it without regret. I also love their vegetable tempura because the veggies aren't over nor undercooked. It is cooked perfectly to compliment the crunch to the tempura batter.  With all that said, that's all I can say about Sushi Tachi in recent times. Today, we decided, more like I decided...let's go to Sushi Tachi for their AYCE. The last couple.times we had gone for actual sushi, we always left disappointed in the overall quality of their sushi. But, I'm pretty fair. It has been awhile, we've never gone for their AYCE, let's indulge...annnnd it's nearby so why not.  Service, the waitress was great! There werent too many people in there. Perhaps because tis a Tuesday around 1pm. Perfect! Lots of seating, not noisy, the babies can continue their sleep in peace.   I noticed they had revamped the look of their menu, cool. Also, their AYCE is now 60 mins lunch or dinner.  I was excited to dig in, but when I started looking thru the menu, I instantly felt bored. I don't know why. Maybe twas the sushi gods giving me the forewarning.  Anyhow, I got the Hawaiian roll (spicy tuna inside, tuna on top with spicy mayo drizzled on top of that topper), oh! Philly, spicy tuna cut roll, salmon skin roll, garlic tuna, and a seared tuna.   The only two that didn't disappointment, just happened to be the two that have been fried in some way (oh!philly and salmon skin incase I lost you there). Safe to say. Most things fried are usually oh so badly good, cant really fail on that end. All the ones which truly mattered, just disappointing. Sadly, Sushi Tachi just drizzle happy their sushis. Even a simple tuna nigiri is masked by some soy sauce base concoction. There was nothing garlic about.my garlic tuna, and certainly nothing seared about my seared tuna.   The only freshness about the tunas in my opinion, is that all my tuna dishes tasted like they came straight out of the fridge....Nothing like tasting the coldness to your fish. Literally, from fridge to cutting board. Don't like that. It's how I felt about my macaron experience. The Hawaiian roll was.unmemorable.   24.95 for an AYCE there literally made me say, man...I wish we went to Kaizen. Whaaaaa?!?! (In minion voice). I literally felt like I needed to change my Kaizen star rating after today's experience. I don't think they're worth 24.95 in my opinion. Sure you get some alcohol, but, I come for sushi. I got the alcohol, I got the sushi, but I also got disappointed with the overall quality and cleanliness may I add.  I have to give them 3 stars from the 3 items I love from here, and the service from our waitress. So, we will only return for my pregnancy craves minus the pregnant part. Officially done coming here for sushi.we were done along time ago...but this was the grand finale.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly (just don't bring in those side-by-side kind of strollers). Don't know if the buckles to their high chairs work as we didn't need it today."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I am very picky with my sushi but this place really does a good job and hits the spot. It is also conveniently minutes from my job, so lunch is always quick and easy.   I usually do go there on my lunch break and even as  a take out, it is very quick! Their lunch specials are very well priced for someone who usually is on a budget. I have yet to go for dinner yet..but i look forward to actually sit inside and enjoy more of it!"}
{"text":"Kept forgetting my order and they keep you waiting so long just so they can charge you more. Worst sushi reaturant ive been to. Go to sushi kaya for better service and better sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite sushi places! The staff is always so nice and on top of things. The Vegas roll is a must!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tachi has become my husband's and my place to go for sushi in NLV. The food is consistently good and service is exceptional. They have great Monday and Tuesday deals and a decent selection of rolls. All-you-can-eat is the way to go!   The only thing I don't like is once we were given lots of grief for bringing in a few chicken nuggets for my four-year-old (who doesn't like sushi or anything else the place offers). They almost didn't let us stay to eat! The next week - they had a sign up saying \"no outside food\". While I understand the rule, it's disappointing that I cant visit unless I don't have my kids with me.   Note to self: teach my kids to like sushi. Until then, I will not have many chances to visit Sushi Tachi! Beware parents - don't bring (outside) food for your kids in. They will turn you away. But if it's date night - I recommend this place! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, food is good BUT... something is Different. As I get my order I dive right in and eat a piece. What happen next was appalling. They OVER STUFF THE SASHIMI WITH RICE COMPACTING IT AND IT WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY. This was done on purpose so you don't eat as much because you will fill up twice as fast. Trying to  get over on customers. Adding the extra COMPACT HEAVY RICE made the food UN- ENJOYABLE. All I could taste was RICE, DRY ASS RICE. So now I'm stuck here trying to finish my first order 45mins later. This is some REAL ISH (SugarHoneyIceTea) I will not come back."}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and tried sushi for the first time here.. I liked it then.. this last time I went I wasn't too happy. I felt like the rolls had too much rice. Not sure what changed but this used to be my go to spot for sushi and I have to say it isn't anymore. Service was slow and we waited a while to get our order in and for the rolls to come out. It's a shame, this area needs a good sushi spot. Guess I'll have to continue making my journey to China town."}
{"text":"Most AMAZING Quality and Selection of Unique rolls that I have had at any AYCE Sushi house. MUST TRY THE Mahi Mahi roll , Moon River roll , Last Samurai roll and Sexy Girl rolls. All of their selections have Incredible flavors. Very fresh !! I will be back MANY TIMES !!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and the staff were very nice, considering we were in a large group for my besties birthday. The all you can eat sushi is the best value. I went with my favorite the California Roll. I also had some of the tiger, wet dream, and spider rolls. It was muy bueno. Overall I loved the experience, the only complaint is that my husbands teryaki chicken was bland, but it's a sushi place."}
{"text":"I love this place. The servers are nice and always smiling and the Sushi is amazing!! Great atmosphere and great food. Their All You Can Eat Sushi is worth it specially since it includes Sake and beer! Food is always fresh and delicious. One of my favorite Sushi places in Vegas."}
{"text":"The prices were on par the food was ok and the service was poor.  The staff at the register acted like it was an inconvenience I was coming in to order food.  Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"I used to like here. but last time visit was nightmare....  Came here for dinner around 5. 60min AYCE.i had to wait 30min to get the sushi!!  Only couple table was seated.they weren't busy.whats happen?? There wasn't soy sauce plate,no chopstick. We were three.come on woman!!we were three.Why you brought just one ?!then I have to ask again.  And server forgot some order from ours... I was about piss off like don't wanna pay any. But of course I did n left tip..But it was really sucks!!"}
{"text":"our favorite barista introduced us to this place the other night and we are overjoyed that there's a good sushi joint located right in our neighborhood! we decided to take advantage of the 'all you can eat & drink' for $26.00 which is probably one of the best deals in town!! the sushi was extremely fresh and the ala carte items (cucumber salad, tempura, fried calamari, baked mussels, etc) were delicious. i couldn't get away from the potato wrapped shrimp!! YUMMMMM YUMMMMM. i highly recommend if you're in north las vegas - near aliante... stop by! you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't understand why this place has so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  Unfortunately we were there on a Saturday, no all you can drink beer/sake (bud light/house sake).  We actually went around lunch and dinner time (got there at 3:45 dinner starts at 4).  They gave us the option to do AYCE lunch $23.95 or dinner $26.95.  I wanted to do dinner so I could order Uni but we opted for lunch and I'm so glad we did.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to scope it out and see how fresh their fish were.  Not so fresh!  I thought the nigiri was below average... the rice was undercooked and the fish smelled fishy and was cut horribly.  For example, the salmon nigiri we ordered was huge but not in a good way.  The texture of it was like biting into flesh or something, yuck.  It was definitely not melt in your mouth sushi.    The rolls were alright (then again the fish is smothered with sauce but we could still taste a little fishiness).  They made a roll for us they didn't have on the menu which was nice of them.  Poke was alright, although they gave only a few chunks of Ahi and lots of onion (I'm assuming it is Ahi).  The only rolls I enjoyed were the avocado roll and natto roll.  My husband wants to go back for their all you can drink night, I'm not sure if I will be joining him.  If I do I will be ordering ala carte (avocado and natto roll)."}
{"text":"Awful.  Went last night for $26.95 dinner AYCE sushi. Sunday-Wednesday the AYCE sushi includes bud light and sake. I can only imagine that is what's keeping this place afloat.   I read in a lot of the reviews that the service was kinda slow so we ordered everything at once. 1.5 hours later we were still waiting for some of the rolls.   Waitress with short hair (she didn't have a nametag) was nice, but odd. Soy sauce on the table was empty the whole time we were there despite two requests.   Ordered the \"baked scallop shell\" twice because they forgot it the first time. What they brought me was almost comical...it was like they mixed up fake crab meat with the world's tiniest scallops and put it in a rammekin with mayo on top. When I bit into this hot mess the scallops were still frozen but the fake crab meat was hot. I almost tossed my cookies right there on the table.  It almost makes me wonder if the reason they didn't bring it out the first time i asked is because they were out of it so they tried to make something up. Here, feed this to the white girl....she won't know the difference!  Uni was completely melted and turning brown which tells me it is old.   Gross. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and the service was really quick too! Since moving, was having trouble finding a new sushi place closer to home. Little did I know it was literally right around the corner! Very good food and great friendly service."}
{"text":"Love Sushi Tachi! Always fast & friendly service. They offer great bento boxes for lunch. Try the Chi Chi roll :)"}
{"text":"One of my go to sushi spots! Sushi tachi is around the corner from my house and I am so happy I found a place nearby with yummy sushi! Whenever I go I always get the AYCE and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Tachi. My brother and I love to eat lunch here on Sunday afternoons after a night of work. AYCE and drink is great. Order as fast as you can and it keeps on coming no complaining about whether you need to finish what is in front of you first or you can only order one or two things at a time. The nigiri is always great and the choices of specialty rolls is great. Upgrade to the dinner price and you are eating sweet shrimp and other specialties for a couple dollars more. Wonderful chefs and wait staff. Getting hungry already."}
{"text":"I went out there for lunch and it was inexpensive and good. I love the decor and the ambience. I didn't try the all you can eat sushi, but it was very appealing. The sushi was fresh. The service was inviting and warm, but lack a little personal touch. I wish they could smile more. It was busy for where its located and the wine store next door is a great compliment."}
{"text":"My brother told me to pick a new place tp eat to take me to celebrate my birthday (a little late might I add). I yelped and came upon this place.   Let me tell you, this is the best sushi place I've been too. It's a little pricey but it's definitely worth every single penny. The waiter ( forgot his name, sorry ) was wonderful, always with a smile and always making sure we were doing ok, very polite and always asking if we needed anything else plus he laughed at my brothers jokes (that's definitely a plus). I had the plum wine and loved it.  To make this story shorter because I could keep on going. I highly recommend Sushi Takashi, we'll be coming back for sure ."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever eaten. No joke. Fresh, delicious, perfect texture,. All the things you want from sushi. Will definitely be a place I frequent often. No need to look for more sushi in Vegas, at least for me."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed the food and service. It Was not too busy at the time we went(9:30 pm). We lived the spider roll and chubby roll the most. All you can eat sushi was perfect. Good came out quick, not a long wait at all. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. The atmosphere was nice as well."}
{"text":"The AYCE is a reasonable price, and if you like to eat lots of fresh yummy sushi...it's the best deal.  I've  always had a great experience here.  Fresh food, good service, and free sake Sun-Wed. The chefs know what I like, and just feed me. Sometimes the service is a bit slow when it's peak dinner time, but I get it. The Hotmama roll, and NY girl in Vegas are my favorites. I like that they don't cover my rolls with sauce."}
{"text":"Visit here often... Monthly specials are always on point never disappointed...  Rolls sometimes fall apart not always rolled tight..."}
{"text":"This is a really great sushi spot. Fresh, delicious food, clean and relaxing environment with really fast service. We had to wait once for a take out order because they were really busy but that was understandable. Everyone is polite and helpful. At some point they made it so you can order \"half rolls\", meaning 4-5 pieces of a roll instead of a full roll; this is amazing for All You Can Eat. I like to try all different rolls but sometimes I don't want to eat 8 pieces of each (and get full before I can try everything). Love it!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Service was good (sushi bar and from the wait staff). Brightly lit and spacious dining area.  Good food, great AYCE value if you take advantage of the unlimited Bud Lite and House sake promo.  And the ability to order just about all the rolls in 1/2 portion size.  I ended up at Tachi because I was turned away by the overwhelming response to Sushi Mon's 10year anniversary promotion (Maryland Pkwy location) and was in the vacinity running some errands.  When I arrived at 5:15pm, the place was still fairly empty, but was close to 75% capacity when I left at 6:30pm.  The restaurant definitely has a good following in the NW.  The food was good, I enjoyed most of the items I ordered (san the Spider Roll I ordered at the end, which I thought was bland and the sushi rice didn't taste right - maybe it was a new batch or the end of one).  Anyway, here is my review of the items I also ordered: * Fried Calamari appetizer from the kitchen was excellent.  Just dried perfectly, with a light batter coating.  * N.Y. Girl In Vegas Roll - Pretty good, I enjoyed it overall, but would have like less mayo on it. * Dragon Roll - good stuff,great if you like eel. * One More Time Roll - Pretty good, but would be super if the mango used was more tasty and ripe (but we know mangos are not in season in the fall/winter). * Uni/Ikura/Garlic Tuna and all the nigiri I ordered were all good.  Very satisfied!  I skipped the dessert due to time constraint, but the restaurant offers the usual ice cream (green tea, red bean and plum) and during dinner one order of mochi ice cream (mango, strawberry or vanilla).  Price:  $24.95 (45 minutes) 11:30AM - 4:00PM $26.95 (60 minutes) 4:00PM - 10:30PM  Misc comments: 1. The chair at the sushi bar is maybe 6 inches too low.  It felt awkward sitting there at first, but the padding on the chair was comfortable. 2. Waitresses were on top of refills, I didn't have to ask for hot tea once and the used plates were cleared quickly. 3. The young Japanese waitress is cute. 4. There are off menu items (specialty rolls) that you can order, but the names and images of it are hanging as pictures on the back wall.  You can totally miss it, if you are seated in the wrong part of the restaurant. 5. Anthony, the Mexican Sushi Chef, was great.  Made the rolls quickly and profeciently.  Location:  NW Las Vegas. Perfect for those living in the Aliante area.  Service:  4.5/5  No complaints here.  Food: 4/5  The fish are fresh.  Good selection overall.  No daily specials like at some other sushi bars (not a negative, just pointing out a fact).  Price:  3/5  In line with other AYCE sushi bars in Las Vegas.  Parking:  3/5  In the same strip mall with a gym, parking wasn't a problem for me, but it was pretty full when I left.  I would definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place not only serves fresh, delicious sushi...but it's all you can eat!! It's not buffet style, like you would expect either...you order off of a menu and they bring it fresh!! Their all-you-can eat menu also includes apps like miso soup & edamame and dessert, like green tea ice cream. You can also get a punch card and once you have so many all-you-can eat meals, you get one free! Definitely a great deal. The employees are also all very friendly! You will not be disappointed by eating here!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and starving for lunch. We decided against AYCE and instead ordered some lunch specials and a couple of appetizers to share.  We ordered the shumai and gyoza to start. These were decent, but nothing amazing. Two of my dining companions complained about the shumai tasting overly fishy. I ordered the sushi lunch for my entree. It included five pieces of sushi and a California roll. The sushi and roll were not good. The fish was not fresh and the California roll had an unpleasant texture.   The service was really friendly and they accommodated all the specific requests our table had, but I don't think I would come back even if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"I don't eat sushi but my boyfriend and I just moved to the area and we were looking for a new spot. Came here and got a beef teriyaki bowl. Delicious and filling. He is loving all the sushi. Service is good, but could be that there was only three other diners here. We'll be back! Only bad things: no jalepeno poppers, orgasm sauce, and the menu combinations on the rolls weren't that great. Flavor was there."}
