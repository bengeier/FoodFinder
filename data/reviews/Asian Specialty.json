{"text":"This is probably my favourite Vietnamese takeout place in the Scarborough/markham area..locted in the chartwell food court..I love their pho ga (shredded chicken with rice noodles in chicken broth topped with fried shallots)...the soup is so yummy and aromatic (savoury with a bit of sweetness) I find myself drinking the broth after I finish my noodles! Their vermicelli and rice dishes are also good, they use broken rice which is a bonus. I have had the pho but the pho ga is ALWAYS calling my name...haha Closed on tuesdays."}
{"text":"Seems I'm often starting with a caveat.  In this case, it's the fact that I've only ever had one dish.  The red vegetable curry.

Some background;  this is a fast food place in a food court.  The food court consists of 6-8 other asian take-outs.  This one is always popular because it's good.  It's in a little enclosed mall BEHIND the strip mall on Brimley.  Enter off of Huntingwood.

Anyway, back to the curry.  The friendly counter guy, who's been there forever, is helpful if you're unsure what to order.  He knows what I want, so as I approach, he gets the red curry sauce out of the freezer (that they have previously prepared...it's not packaged sauce), and takes it to the chef.  They then prepare a fresh curry with lots of veggies, tofu and basil leaves.  This dish, served with perfectly steamed rice, is as good as any veggie curry I've had in a Thai restaurant.

Hmmm, I think it's time to go back..."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for something quick and yummy, I come here. It's amazing how this is the ONLY place in Scarborough that offers crazy authentic Vietnamese noodle dishes, like bun mam, bun mang vit, bun bo hue, cho lon mi Thap cam. Their pad Thai is pretty awesome too:)"}

Before I proceed to write this review -- or in your case, vicariously read my persuasive review of rhetoric on why you should eat at Asian Specialty, one must give credit where it is due. Shout out to Jennifer K, for providing the near-perfect recommendation. Here is her link: http://www.yelp.ca/user_details?userid=CxDOIDnH8gp9KXzpBHJYXw

It goes without saying you would not expect delicious food at a local food court, let alone in a mangy-looking Chinese mall. Twaddle, the lot of them! Suspend any previous judgments or preconceived notions. You must try Asian Specialty!

It was a weary late afternoon, on a breezy day, where I beheld this beautiful Bun Bo Hue. I desired a bowl of noodle soup -- a noodle soup not ordinary by any rate, but special in every kind. Two of my buddies had resolved to stay at the mall, and find a local restaurant to eat at. Such desires at this particular time require you to curb your hunger. But my mind haplessly obeyed my stomach, submitting to my wayward hunger. After reading Jennifer K's review on Yelp, I decidedly procured myself with a Bun Bo Hue.

I approached the server at the front counter. His countenance and body language suggested he preferred to be somewhere else. I placed my order for Bun Bo Hue. From thence, the man immediately took out a cell phone and started texting. To further increase my disdain for the service, the long wait for the food was almost unbearable. The lack of quality service detracts from my overall experience and hindered my final score.

At last, the Bun Bo Hue is ready, piping hot straight out of the kitchen and onto my table. The aromas and the spices filled my nose instantly. Behold the greatness which laid before my eyes. Naught is more delicious than satisfying your hunger with a bespoke bowl of Bun Bo Hue. This bowl shewed signs of beauty unlike any other, endowed with all the essence of an amazing noodle soup. I commandeered my chopsticks and spoon, preparing to lay siege on this bowl. Here's where things start to get kinky. I picked a handful of noodles and beef with my chopsticks with a spoonful of soup and slurped all its contents. The first bite filled my mouth with a ephemeral, but intense sense of satisfaction, an orgasmic feeling that continues to bind me into a mysterious state of flux. Where had this noodle soup existed for all my life? 

After spending much time thinking on my feet at work, to satisfy my hunger with a well-made bowl of Bun Bo Hue, was the most gratifying feeling in the world. To say the Bun Bo Hue was delicious is an understatement -- a word unfit to contain to totality of my love for this bowl of noodle soup.

The noodles were fairly well cooked, with each bite of great texture. The beef, however was layered with fat, with rarely any edible meat. The broth itself was brewed to perfection, complimenting well with all the ingredients into unison. The spice level hit the mean between excessiveness and deficiency. Regardless of spicy food lovers or mild eaters, this bun bo hue caters to everyone. Also, the coagulated pork blood was positive addition to meal, while the vegetables provided a refreshing crunch to the overall bowl.

While the Bun Bo Hue was the embodiment of near-greatness, there was still one more flaw that lowered my score. There was a lack of lemongrass flavour in its broth, that other Bun Bo Hue restaurants offer. Regardless of this flaw, I devoured all the contents that filled my bowl

Let me bestow you with a recommendation: eat at Asian Specialty. Verily, Asian Specialty serves delicious food, only marred by its flaws. The bane of below average food-court eats is forever subverted. Were the service not been terrible, I might have given an overall rating of 4.5 stars out of five. I almost considered lowering this grade into 3 stars, but the Bun Bo Hue left a lasting impression. It is therefore a tragedy that the service and lack of lemongrass flavour hindered itself from a near-perfect score.  But if you desire to slake your hunger with Vietnamese food after a strenuous day at work, visit Asian Specialty, posthaste.

Professional Tip 101: Put your cell phone away."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out with so many positive reviews and I finally had a chance.  And I must say, my experience did not mirror that of the other reviewers.  

We ordered a bun bo hue and a pho with brisket.  Our order took some 15 minutes and by a food court standards, that's pretty long to wait for your food.  Both soups arrived luke warm, not piping hot, so -1 star right off the bat.  

Condiments offered were 1 skinny sprig of thai basil and some sad looking sprouts.  No lime in sight.  Another -1 star.  When I went back to the counter to ask for some more basil and lime, the lady gave a huge sigh as if I was requesting some huge favor.  Another -1 star.  

As for the actual food, both soups were forgettable.  I could not detect much spices in either soups with broth lacking in complexity.  Even with the \"extra\" basil and the lime wedges, the soups failed to live up to anything remotely close to \"Vietnamese\".  

With so many other options in the area, I doubt I'd go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the food court. We've being coming to this place ever since it started few years back. It's a business ran by Vietnamese family, so we trust that the flavour is authentic! Our favourite is the original specialty pho. The rice dishes are also great as well! As long as the store exists in this food court, this will be the only place I go to!"}
{"text":"Asian Specialty is great food court find at the Chartwell Shopping Centre in Scarborough.  Most times Vietnamese food court tends to be bland and lacking but not here.
Its been a while since I've eaten here and decided to try them out again after a long absence and I'm glad they are still really good.

I always judge a place by the Pho Special as I believe all great Vietnamese restaurants should be based on the quality of its pho (along with its cousin Bun Bue Hue of course!)

The Pho here is very flavourful, rich and tasty. Excellent quantity of meat to noodle to soup ratios were used here and the texture was perfect.   The condiments that are available are excellent as well with the stand out being their green chilis in vinegar.

The main focus or \"Asian Specialty\" is Vietnamese but they also have some Thai and other South East Asian dishes that look pretty good as well.

As a food court place their food definitely ranks higher the most restaurants that I've been to.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to spot for pho! Service is quick, price is fair, and food is always fresh. Great place to go if you want pho but don't want to smell like pho after being inside a viet restaurant.
I usually get the special beef noodle soup and an iced Vietnamese coffee. That will ring you up for about $12 taxes in.
They have various condiments for you to add. I especially appreciate the slivers of habaneros.
Try to avoid lunch hour as the food court does get very very busy and seating is limited."}
{"text":"I have low expectation when I looking at Asian Speciality's menu. Hmmm, another Vietnamese Pho place in a Food Court? How good can it be?

At here, in this food court I have one of the the best Bún bò Hu I ate.

Served pipping hot the broth is so spicy, so fragrant and just full of flavours. The pig's knuckles so tender so is the beef shank and even with cubes of pig blood!!! The herbs for garnishing includes cilantro, mint, basil, green onion and raw red onion.. and more!! 

The menu here is quite extensive. But this bowl of noodles just Wow me! 

Definitely come to Asian Specialty if you do have this craving for Vietnamese food, especially Bún bò Hu! I am sure you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The parents have discovered food courts are the places to go to. Now that prices are increasing everywhere who can object to that logic. So decided to tag along for a free meal on a Sunday afternoon after hearing them talk about this food court several times. They were definitely not the only ones to have realized this because the parking lot was packed. Somehow found a spot and entered the plaza, completing the first mission. Next, was to find a spot in the seating area. All the seats were occupied so had to hover close to people who looked like they were almost done. Second mission, complete. For the final and last stage, to decide on what to eat.

Decided on pho because noodles plus hot soup plus meat equals the perfect lunch meal. The noodles were on the thinner side, felt less substantial but that's a personal preference, didn't feel as full after the meal as normal. The taste of the broth was definitely a strong competitor to the other Vietnamese restaurants. They put plenty of protein on the top which was definitely welcomed.

Overall, a fan of the pho but not a fan of the plaza. Will come back during non peak hours for a more enjoyable meal experience."}
