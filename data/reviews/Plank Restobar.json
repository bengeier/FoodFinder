{"text":"Always a good time at Plank, broad variety of creative sharing plates that are modified regularly, daily specials and a great selection of wines and draft beers.  Wish they took evening reservations."}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a date. It was a really good choice on his part. I would love to live closer so I could try other things on the menu. 

We ate at the bar because it being two days before Christmas, it was super busy. But, I personally found that there was plenty of room. The bar tender was really polite and looked after up rather promptly, considering it was packed! I was really impressed.

We had the deep fried cauliflower - which I thought were awesome. The garlic cream sauce that accompanied the dish took it to the next level! Next we had the calamari. They were so delicately fried that they weren't too caked with batter, just the way I like them. And the seafood cause was spicier than most places, which is also how I like it.

After sharing those two dishes, we ordered the sausage and pepper pizza to share. I could only eat one piece cause I was so full! Those two dishes were not small portions. The pizza was great, but I could have liked more sausage, each piece has two little medallions. 

I'm hoping to go back soon and try everything I couldn't fit into my belly before!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is delicious- my favorite is the calamari it is the best!! Also- I had the onion and olive pizza, it was amazing."}
{"text":"Great dinner with the wife on a date night. Ate until we were stuffed with a fantastic assortment of unique dishes including duck poutine, pepper calamari and sliders. All were very good, atmosphere was great and our server was top notch. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and a fantastic atmosphere. I love going to this place with friends as it's a great social environment to share some good food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and cheese is the best I've ever had!! Great ambience, friendly staff, I'll always come back for the duck poutine."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went here on a date with my spouse and we absolutely Loved the whole look and atmosphere of the place.  The service was wonderful, the drinks were AMAZING (and they have a fantastic bourbon selection), and the food was WOW, absolutely top notch.  Will definitely be going back ASAP! And I recommend that anyone else considering trying this place should get over there as soon as you can and give it a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delirium Tremens on tap!  Love the cauliflower fritters as always. Duck confit poutine a winner. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a number of years and have yet to be disappointed. The menu is very creative and offers a good variety. The decor is quite rustic and cozy and they offer patio seating during the warmer seasons. Brunch is also delicious and offers a variety of dishes. The staff is always extremely friendly and efficient. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have ventured into plank many times always in a small group (2-4 people). I would consider the food to be good for Oakville but it is always overshadowed by the terrible service. You can only give a restaurant so many opportunities to disappoint. This past Sunday my dad and I were hanging out and decided to give it another shot. The restaurant was busy but certainly not full, if anything it looked like they were just dying down from a dinner rush. We were greeted at the door, seated in a timely manner and waters poured. Then (spoiler alert: it's about to get nerdy) as if my dad and I had been draped in Harry potter's invisible cloak, we were never tended to again. We waited and waited AND waited and no one came. We watched three servers clean tables, we watched the manager doing sweet F.A., we watched people finish their meals and walk out the door and still no one came. I was getting really pissed off.. Why should I spend my money and support a local establishment that doesn't give two youknowwhats about customer service?! If you don't care then I don't care! So I told my dad we were leaving. We got up, put our coats on and walked right out and no one said a damn thing! So if you want to support a restaurant that is too arrogant to provide good customer service to go along with their decent food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Always very good, but my last visit was worthy of a great review.

Went in last Sunday for a late lunch and was reminded of the reason I really like this place.  Plenty of tables now since the expansion (maybe a year ago?) so much easier to be a walk up.

Friendly servers, a nice beer list, and my standard Big Bird pizza came out fabulous along with fantastically cooked calamari which is my second favorite thing on the menu.  The kitchen staff always seem to do at least a very good job, but they were perfect last Sunday.  Well done."}
{"text":"If you are in Oakville, do not miss Plank. It has an incredibly cozy vibe and delicious food to match. You can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu. My personal favorites: Mac Daddy and Little Rocket Man - YUM. Shout out to Jenn for being the best!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Oakville. The best thing is the vibe- it just has a great energy and always feels buzzy, cozy and fun. A seat at the bar is best for that. I love that they are always changing their menu and coming up with trendy dishes with local ingredients. Best poutine ever. Great cocktail list. I've found the dishes occasionally inconsistent, but it's always worth coming back."}
{"text":"Waffle topped with crispy fried chicken topped with eggs! Excellent option for a person who prefers meat and savory for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   Sunday brunch, a patio lunch, small plates to share or just a night cap in a fun bar - its probably the most happening place to be in Bronte.  Food is always prepared with care and well presented.  My fav's are the sliders, cauliflower fritters, calamari and su mei, truffled macaroni- and great bourbon cocktails.  I thought the duck pouting was just so so.  
Great ambiance, I appreciate a noisy restaurant with no TV's - there is great buzz.  As for the american tapas theme - not really - more like small plates to share and they are all really good
Restraunteur Doug seems to be the only guy in bronte who knows what he is doing.... this place is awesome.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, a tad loud and tables are tightly packed in. They have a patio and weather permitting that's where I will try to sit next time. Food was great, especially the cauliflower fritters! Soooo yummy! Also tried the ricotta with warm bread, also very good! I had the mac and cheese, all in all not bad, a little different from cheddar mac and cheese but still pretty tasty and the portion size was great as well. The steak and frites went over very well with my dinner mates as did one of their pizzas however the pizza did not list ham on the menu but it had ham on the pizza. Not a big deal in this case as the eater liked it. Overall I would go back and order a bunch of different apps for the table... especially the cauliflower fritters!"}
{"text":"Nice design and good food but there could be more vegetarian options... Service was good and they have a nice patio!"}
{"text":"Vibrant atmosphere with creative bites and bigger bites! Very nice place for a drink and some decent food to pair with. Friendly staff and nice decor~ will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Food:
House Sliders: yummy but a bit salty 
Bacon Risotto: again on the salty side, but I love the texture and bacon flavour of it 
Wings: a bit too sour on the outside and dry inside 
Baby Bok Choy Salad: it tasted like lighted kimchi, very refreshing
Pork Tacos: I liked the crispy fried pork belly, well balanced with sour slaws (if I remember it correctly) 

Overall food was good. Small portions so u get to try a variety.

Service was attentive and food came pretty fast.

Would come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was completely underwhelmed.  Great vibe, nice patio.... but the food was entirely underwhelming.  Tried to pick a healthy option... chicken lettuce wraps as an app.  So oily and greasy - didn't even know that was possible.  So disappointed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Plank is just the type of restaurant I love to eat at. Small plates of delicious food and a menu that reflects what is in season.  The atmosphere is great and the food was delicious.  Even with a small menu I had a tough time deciding what to order since it all sounded so tasty.  

I had the Plank Poutine (shoestring fries with duck confit and foi gras sauce).  I plan on coming back often to try everything on the menu.  And since it changes regularly there is always something new to enjoy.  

Oh and if you get a chance, sit at the bar by the register.  You'll get to chat with Bruno while he whips up delicious pizzas right in front of you. Great experience all around!

Edit: I've gone back 3 more times (once for lunch, once for late dinner, once for takeout) since first visiting Plank and I'd give this place another star if I could.  The pizzas are amazing and are great for takeout!  Try the AC/DC, it is half a pizza and half a calzone and fully delicious.  For lunch mid week it was pretty empty which was surprising.  Late night dinner on the other hand had a great crowd of people enjoying the food and bar.  Definitely a cool place just to hang out.

Don't forget to find out what the specials are as well.  They always sound so good.  For a lunch special I had a lamb sausage over maple baked beans and toast.  Absolutely delicious.  The fried dough balls are a great app as well.  

I just wish the prices of the small plates were a little less expensive, only because I always want to order 2 or 3.

Do yourself a favor and check out this great restopub in Bronte.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some apps and drinks here on a week night. What brought us here is the atmosphere and its proximity to where I live. 

We ordered the battered cauliflower, cobb salad, burger sliders and Steigl Radler. But here's the pincher...it took 20minutes which seemed like forever, before someone even approached our table to offer drinks or take that order. It was unfortunate and yet the place was not even that busy. 

The service - 2/5 slooow
The Sliders - 2/5 Beef patty was pretty dry
The Battered Cauliflower - 5/5 it was crunchy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside
Cobb Salad - 4/5 fresh

I might give them another chance. Not sure if it will be a regular place though..."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the area!  We've been about +10 times in the past year and we've never been disappointed with the food and service!  It's affordable and delicious!  The staff are very welcoming and down to earth.

I recommend Plank to everyone!"}
{"text":"A real gem tucked away by the water in Bronte Village and easily my new favourite place in Oakville.  

The decor is rustic and warm and the beer and liquor selection is excellent. The open concept kitchen really adds to the vibe.

Clean, quality food. I had the Philly Cheese steak pizza and it was delicious. Washed it down with a couple craft beers. Oh yeah.

Service was excellent and the washrooms were spotless. Well run. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"They need to do something to fix the fly situation. Spent the entire meal swatting flies and the food wasn't worth putting up with them."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekday evening with my family and couldn't get a drink? Have to be 21+ to drink here despite Ontario law. Really wished we knew this before arriving and I don't know the reason for the restriction especially since it is a restaurant but they lost our business as we decided to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I treated my Aunt and Cousin to a Christmas week lunch at the Plank Restobar as it was conveniently located and they were excited to try it. The online reviews were good so I assumed it would be okay. For the record, NOTHING about it was okay.

I had a reservation, but they made us wait at the door (tables were open by the way). My Aunt who is almost 90 and has a cane was not offered a seat - so I found her one. There were 2 servers on lunch duty and they just sort of spun around a lot and accomplished little. They were unhelpful and unprofessional.

The lunch menu was less than inspired and I struggled to find something I wanted to eat. My Aunt had a smoked salmon platter, my Cousin had the corned beef which looked decent and I had a Chowder which was cool, crap, potato-laden and very difficult to find a piece of fish in the goopy non-fish base. Absolutely disgusting for a $14 bowl of chowder. I forced in as much as I could.

It was obvious we all wanted to get out of there as fast as possible - we didn't order drinks, appetizers, coffee or dessert.

Also, there are 3 unisex toilets - located at the tables at the back (where we refused to sit as the tables have high chairs and are not suitable for everyone). That seems disgusting to me, but if you are okay with listening to toilets flush, toilet doors open/close and smelliness - you should be okay."}
{"text":"PRO: Beautiful decor, free parking, easy location to get to. Chianti wine was nice.

CON: The whole dining experience. My friend and I went last night after another friend had recommended it. We shared all of our dishes (as this is a tapas style resto). We asked about a dessert menu before ordering our food and our server said they had a separate one for after the meal. The nachos were smothered in a creamy sauce that was tasteless and made the nachos super soggy. The pulled pork thrown on top was stale. We left half of the nachos/pork on the plate. The chicken paremsan meatballs were good, but I still think my mom makes better meatballs (I'm Italian so maybe I'm biased). The rainbow salad was interesting...a bit bitter, a bit sweet. It was nice to clear my palate after the overly creamy nachos, but it didn't \"wow\" me. With a glass of wine each, the bill came to around $60, and I left barely satisfied. 

The service was alright until the end when a different server came to serve us our bill, without offering the dessert menu (again, we had asked about dessert even before we started eating). We barely got a chance to speak to a server because the one we originally had didn't come back and the \"replacement\" literally only came to clear the plates and serve the bill at the end. It appears that once you've received your food, you're not as important. 

We ended up going to a coffee shop for a tea and dessert afterwards. 

I will not go back."}
{"text":"New favourite spot in Oakville. Great location, cool vibe & fantastic service. The Tuna Poke was literally one of the best things we had tasted and the Pirogies with crispy prosciutto were to die for. My husband had the sliders as well and said they were hands down, incredible. To top it off, the service was friendly, personable and prompt. This is definitely going to be our go to spot for future date nights and social get togethers! Excellent job Plank!"}
{"text":"After months of wanting to hit up Plank, the opportunity finally availed itself. Cutting right to the chase, I am giving this place 5 stars based on ambiance, and if course food and drink.

I love the size of this restaurant, and the lighting.  Somewhat dimly lit, with lots of wood and stone throughout, one might mistake themselves for being somewhere more downtown.  The bartenders were very friendly and were quick to talk shop with an amateur like myself.

Into the belly went the following (in no particular order): the pulled pork nachos (excellent), dumb son (siu mei - mediocre), salt and pepper calamari (very nice), and of course Mac and cheese sticks.  All of these were share plates. I sat at the bar and kitchen counter and will definitely go for the \"meat\" special next time as the osso bucco and sliders looked amazing!

For drinks, the bartender made a fantastic manhattan which was followed by a proper whiskey sour for dessert.  I will definitely be coming back with a group to check this place out again. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice date night here with my hubby last night. We got to the restaurant early - around 6:00 and there was plenty of table seating but we chose to sit by the bar. Very glad we did! It was a lively place to sit with most of the food prep being done in front of us. We started with a cocktail & beer while we looked at the menu and salivated over the many dishes being prepared in front of us. 
We decided on the Nacho Libre, New England Style Seafood Chowder and their pizza special for the night - a pal zone - part pizza, part calzone. 
The Nachos were to.die.for! So good! Nacho chips, Mexicana Cheddar, tequila braised brisket, avocado crema, & tomatillo salsa - I was licking my fingers for sure! 
I had only a few tastes of the Chowder as my husband was devouring it! 
We chose the pizza special of the evening because it sounded good and an interesting concept - part pizza, part calzone. The pizza part - Margarita was the best part of it. The Calzone part I was excited about cheese & spinach - but it was REALLY heavy on the ricotta cheese - too much for my liking. 
We sat for a while and saw the restaurant fill up quite quickly and saw many more dishes we would like to try - The Magic Treat - Classic Jiffy pop popcorn, truffle butter, sea salt, Parmesan Reggiano smelled amazing! When I'm not quite so worried about my calorie & fat intake I will be back for the Poutine for sure - Shoestring Fries, Belwood County duck confit, local cheese curds, foie gras sauce 
We will be back to this restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good service and good food, what more can you ask for from a \"restobar\".

We will definitely be back, (word of warning, some of the \"small plates\" are a lot of food)."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Oakville. I've been about 4 times now, and the food, service, and atmosphere are alwalys great. You can't go wrong with any dish you get. They're small plates, so I usually try to get at least 4 dishes to share with a friend. And as an added bonus, you can make reservations on OpenTable! :)"}
{"text":"Totally impressed with this place! The vibe is upbeat and the foot is awesome. Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations and we were hesitant as this was our 1st time but the buzz couldn't prevent me from not trying this place out. The selection of tapas was really unique, delicious and reasonably priced. Service was a little slow but I think it's because this place was so busy. 
Casual attire is perfect and its great for couples or friends. A night out to celebrate birthdays is perfect for this; drinks and tapas! Steps away from the lake. 
Awesome! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Seriously different -I love this place!
Every time I have gone ( a lot ) it's been awesome service, fresh food and perfect atmosphere.
Don't be afraid to try their most weirdest dishes because they won't let you down.

Happy planking peeps, cheers!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this on Yelp so we decided to try it out! Definitely a feel at home spot, great atmosphere and the food... Omg the food. Absolutely full of flavor, all very fresh and I felt great afterwards. The only thing I would mention is our attendant made us somewhat feel like we eat quite a lot! We definitely do - but it made us feel a little crappy. The food is amazing - of course I am going to devour it!!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I was here and the 2nd time I had the beef sliders. They are excellent and are large enough to make a full meal.

Both times we've arrived just before the kitchen closed, but the server made sure to get our order to the kitchen, but did it without rushing us.

I'll be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value. VERY busy after work. I virtually had to clothesline an old lady out of her chair/curlers to pony up to the bar. Alas, glad I did. I had the Yorkies and the Steak frites and both were very good and well portioned for tapas. I'd like to see a little bigger wine list, but cocktails were nice. Overall, definitely will go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The best Tapas restaurant I've ever been too. And boy does everyone else already know that too. We've been here twice and both times we had to wait 30 min for a table. But do yourself a favour and wait, you won't be disappointed.

We've tried a lot of things on the menu, and we have yet to try something we didn't like. The duck poutine with foie gras gravy sounds weird but tastes really good. We also tried the house sliders, dumb son (shrimp and pork dumplings), albacore tuna poke, roasted bone marrow, and brats in a blanket. The brats in a blanket is basically bacon wrapped jalapeños poppers, bratwurst, and cheddar. So delicious! 

This place is also home to our all time favourite cocktail- the French 67. Although it's off the drink menu now, I highly recommend you get it. It's basically Prosecco, Gin, Lemon Juice, and Simple Syrup. I don't know who discovered the prosecco and gin combination but whoever it was is genius. 

To Plank Restobar: Bring French 67 back to your drink menu! Otherwise, we're going to keep asking you for it every time we come back :)"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN OAKVILLE!

I just love hanging out at this place. The seating outside is what you should aim for. You will be able to enjoy the beautiful marina along with great food and drinks. 
If you want some tips on what to order - the beef sliders and the ricotta cheese on a bread are a must. The beef sliders were juicy and soft and delicious. Pair those with a Rickards red and you are in for a great night. 
Stay away from the fish taco (one of the worst tacos I have ever eaten) and the pizzas (they are ok but not great). 
Enjoy your experience at this place!"}
{"text":"Several months ago, we (a group of explorative suburban yelpers) traveled to the land of Oakville and experienced all that we could in a single sunny Sunday! 

By the end of the day four of us remained and we wandered into our last stop of the day: Plank Restobar. From the moment I walked in I knew that this was a 4+ star space and after eating and drinking everything that I did, it was/is definitely worth every bit of the 4.5 star I'm giving it. 

This place has a rustic cottage/old house feel inside, with exposed wood fixtures and \"plank\" wood adorned on the walls (Ahhhhh I get the name already! but wait there is more...)

What won me over right away was the fact that this place describes itself as a bourbon bar (sigh... LOVE), and not just any old bourbon bar, one with an endless selection of bourbon options and a diverse cocktail menu to boot!

I started with my signature Old Fashioned (which was OK), however a short time later I ordered one of their specialty Old Fashioneds and WOW - this was the way to go. It put the ZING in AmaZING!!!

After a casual drink or two we decided on an assortment from their delicious tapas menu and shared in 4 tapas platters and a pizza:

The tapas we had were as follows:

THE GOOD/GREAT:
- Fried chicken - Moist and tender on the inside and crispy with a great batter on the outside. A VERY good Fried Chicken! YUM!
- Smoked chicken tacos - this was easily my favorite tapas item we tried. The smoked chicken had an amazing taste and accoutrements inside the tacos were equally tasty! 
- Sliders - ultra tender juicy beef burgers on the small. Loved them and after we shared these 4 ways we were all hungry for more!

THE BAD:
- Cauliflower fritters - Not a good start, we all found these to smell bad and taste as bad they smelt, I don't recommend these one bit (shakes head.. NO.. NO)

THE PIZZA:
- We shared in the prosciutto and arugula. Crust good, toppings were ok but I felt it got a tad soggy if we didn't eat it right away. Overall Pretty good!

Other than a few minor hiccups with the mean (more my personal preference than anything) the only thing that was off was the low number of bathrooms. Certainly not enough to support a happening place like this. 

All the above said the bourbon, staff, venue, and tapas won me over and I'll be back 1000% next time I'm in Oakville - come with me won't you?

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"First if all this is not tapas. I would say tapas inspired. Now that we have that expectation out of the way the service and food are pretty good. I took off the two stars for not actually being a real tapas and for the very noisy atmosphere. Also some of the dishes were salt bombs."}
{"text":"This is a great little restobar in Bronte Village.

There's a very decent beer selection on tap and it has a really comfy atmosphere. Depending on where you're sitting, you can see the water (where the creek runs into the lake). 

I'd give the food 3 stars. The plank poutine, with duck confit, local curds and foie gras sauce, was fantastic. It was a really interesting mix of flavours and it had great texture, which is important for poutine.

The \"hot salami\" pizza, on the other hand, was very underwhelming. It was very basic and didn't offer much in the way of flavour.

I gave this restaurant 4 stars overall because the staff were so friendly and were really sweet to my nieces and nephew. They even gave them dough to play with."}
{"text":"One of the best american tapas joints I have been to. Service and food quality is top notch. They send out food very quickly with great servers. The location is great... By lakeshore Oakville, parking available.

Tried the fried cauliflower, sliders - highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, right by the lake and a cozy cabin-esk interior. That was my favourite part.

The food is good, not amazing. I think the atmosphere makes up for part of this.

We ordered:
-Fish tacos (okay)
-Margaritta pizza (good)
-Nachos (okay)"}
{"text":"Haven't been for four years as it was so bad last time there. Had lunch there today with friends and the service and food were faultless. The staff were charming and very attentive. It's gone from 'I'd never go back there' to 'I cannot wait to return there'. Great place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We ordered and split the duck wings, calamari, fritters, the tuna, and the fish tacos. No complaints. Food was great. My only complaint was the ambiance. If you're on a date, its probably awesome, but for a group out for dinner, its dark...like use your phone flashlight to see the menu dark."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Oakville...no questions! Been five times now and the food has never dissapointed. Theres a reason why this place is packed and your normally have to wait for a dinner table...but its worth the wait. Thanks."}
{"text":"The Rancheros were very delicious. Stuff is cheerful and helpful.

Also the French Toast was special."}
{"text":"Plank is easily my favourite local restaurant. It is the go-to for girls night out, date night or family dinners. 

It is a tapas style restaurant, so order a few things and share with everyone at the table. Usually when the girls and I go we order three Bits & Bites and a pizza. 

The cauliflower fritters and sliders are AMAZING. They are ordered every single time. Tip, specify how you want the sliders cooked or they will come well done. The sauce that comes with the cauliflower is delicious. It makes the entire meal. I have yet to find any other restaurant that does cauliflower fritters as well as Plank. The burgers have bourbon braised onions and bacon aioli on them. Need I say more?

Another yummy Bits and Bites item is the duck poutine. Outstanding. The fries are cooked to perfection, gravy is delicious as are the cheese curds. Very flavorful. The calamari is delicious. Beef tacos are amazing as are the wings. My boyfriend liked the popcorn shrimp, but said he would order other things on the menu before he would order the shrimp again. 

D'Italiano, Big Bird and The Interview are my favourite pizzas. The are thin crust and full of flavour. Easily big enough to share with another person. D'Italiano has prosciutto, shaved fresh parm and arugula. Every bite has a combination of all three flavours. They definitely do not skimp on their toppings. Big Bird has chicken, caramelized onions, bacon, goat cheese and pesto on it. Yum!!! So many amazing flavours going on there. The Interview is for those who like their food a little on the spicy side. It's topped with beef, kimchee, caramelized onions, spicy cheese, roasted red peppers and sesame seeds. It's the newest addition to the pizza menu and definitely does not disappoint.

Typically we wait anywhere from half hour to an hour on a Friday or Saturday evening year around. We've never had a problem finding a little bit of room at the bar and ordering drinks while we wait. Every time the wait has been over half hour we've been brought pizza balls with marinara sauce. It's a nice touch! It is loud in there. Not much can be done about that, it's a busy place that is typically always packed. The decor is awesome. Literally full of wooden planks. Very relaxed, trendy atmosphere. 

I can honestly say we have never had a problem with any of the staff that have served us. All of the girls have been really sweet and smiling. They explain the new menu items and when we order sliders, they make sure there's enough on the plate for everyone to have one. We've had more than one server tend to our table. One might stop by and see if we need drink refills, another may bring the food. The food rarely comes out at the same time. It's brought as it's made so that it is hot. Since we order everything as a shareable, we never mind. 

They have a great drink menu that changes seasonally.

I'm surprised to see so many poor reviews based on my experience over the last few years. If you're on the fence whether or not to try Plank, do it!"}
{"text":"Great location but extremely busy, and a little over priced for what it is. It is a spot to be seen, and drink. Food is good but it isn't chef driven. Also it is very loud."}
{"text":"We reserved a table for 9 for Father's Day 2016 and were looking forward to our usual wonderful experience at The Plank Restobar.   However, we are still baffled and confused  about  our experience,  as it was possibly some of the worst service we ever encountered!   Plus, to add insult onto injury, we were informed at the end of our meal (not beforehand NOR even when we made our reservation days earlier) that there would be an 18% gratuity charge automatically added to our bill because we were a party of 8+.  
Needless to say, we all felt cheated by The Plank's socialistic attempt to charge us for the incredibly inept service of our server.   

The server assigned to our table (she will remain  unnamed) was constantly aloof.  In fact, we found ourselves repeatedly wondering where she had disappeared too for long periods while we sat at our table with empty glasses and empty plates.  We would have sympathized with her if the section was overly busy, but that just simply was not the case.  On the contrary, she (and sadly to say, the management on that day) seemed oblivious to there being any problem.  

After having to go to the bar repeatedly to get our drink orders, FINALLY one of the other service staff I approached realized what was happening after I explained our situation and she sprang into action, getting us our drinks, hors d'oeuvres  and meals; and as she did this, our regular server and the management were ALL noticeably absent.  

In summary, I am SO VERY SORRY to have to write this review because up to this incident we have only had great experiences at The Plank.  Look at my other reviews on TA and you will see I am very positive and generous in my platitudes.  BUT when any establishment decides to implement a MANDATORY \"service charge\"  (at 18% no less) and then does NOTHING to ensure or monitor that the service rendered has met the required level of competency to justify it...  I mean, isn't a \"gratuity\" all about giving a monetary reward for good service rendered?

Will we be back?  Not sure.  Will/can we recommend The Plank for parties of 8+.?... ABSOLUTELY NOT!

We loved the Plank up until now.  I really hope they get a better grasp on their QC regarding service, and eliminate their ridiculous policy of imposing an 18% fine for bad service."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice patio seating area on the water. Ordered sliders, cauliflower fritters and the big bird pizza. The first two were great. The pizza was okay. Finished up with ice cream from a near by store. It is really nice to walk around the area too if you have time. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed when I went their for the irate time. Great tapas, perfect location. Next time  went there with a couple of friends and everything was average. I would still recommend this place as they have since menu and a great place, specially in a summer afternoon."}
{"text":"In. Absolute. Love. Everything about this place makes me smile!!  The food. The atmosphere. The people. Always go here for any excuse to bring people. Food is always on spot and creative, and delicious, and incredible, and....and...and....!  Never, ever disappointed! Best little restaurant in the whooole wooooorld!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The menu is varied and interesting but the wait staff isn't very attentive. I sat at the bar and was only spoken to three times. Once to be seated, once to have my order taken and once to pay. I was never checked on or offered a second drink. But the ambiance is fun and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant but smoky, I assume from the oven or something.  Service was friendly and prompt.  We tried the cauliflower fritters which were yummy!  Also, the Punjabi buttermilk stew which was tasty.  This place would be perfect to unwind after work with a drink."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch on a Thursday.  We ordered a bunch of dishes and started eating when my son says STOP!  And pulls out a dead fly in his dish.  Called the waitress over and she offered to give us 25 % off our meal.  Excuse me??? After seeing how peeved we were she gave us the meal free of charge...needless to say, we stopping eating immediately.

Also know a person who use to work there who says the kitchen is filthy."}
{"text":"Not my worst experience but it's down there.

Food: The food came at a reasonable time (15-20 minutes). The duck taquitos and the cauliflower fritters were the best!!!!!! 

Service: Waiter was having a bad day so the service was heavily lacking.

Environment: REALLY loud place so continuous conversations are non-existent. Restaurant is visually appealing though."}
{"text":"Plank plank \"O\" plank I love you!!I do believe in love at first sight and taste hahaha!This is exactly what has happened between plank plank \"O\" plank and myself!

Food 5/5.

Ambiance here is very tricky to rate.Tables facing the water 5/5 and if not then 3.5/5.

Service is 3.5/5.

To begin with I absolutely love and adore their menu and food they offer here.Its an amazing mix from dim sums to pizzas to their exquisite appetizers.


All together  I have been here three times and each time the food just blew my palettes away!Every dish is unique and prepared with flavor and is oozing of good taste.

Their calamari is to die for-they are chunks of squid lightly battered and fried and their calamari is probably the only one that I have had which is soft and juicy generally they are a bit tough and not so juicy, there's a trick they do with cooking it.I have yet to have better calamari elsewhere and I have had it at many places in different cities.

Next coming on to their duck poutine.It is perfectly doused in gravy and cheese and lots of duck meat-the dish is slightly salty but full of flavor. 

Dim sums are standard quality and very fresh tasting.They also have a dim sum happy hour on weekdays.

Ok now shrimp tempura is prolly the main reason I come to this place.These a good size shrimps with sticks on them.They are lightly battered and melt in the mouth.I would rate it a full 10.Its a must try.

In general the service can be very average since this place is always packed at all times but that's no excuse.If the restaurant knows they are so busy they must hire more employees for customers to enjoy a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Literally the worst. The positive reviews and the fact this place is on many of the \"best restaurants\" list of Oakville absolutely perplexes me. Everything we ordered seemed like it was made by a kindergartener. I was expecting a fun sexy atmosphere and top-notch bar-resto tapas. Instead, the food was AWFUL. The tacos had dry powdery, almost inedible, from-frozen soft shells that were cold. The cauliflower fritters have ZERO flavour. The tuna poke was insanely salty and the dish itself was pointless...Tiny fraction of a chip hiding under a salty spoonful of tuna. Lame and disappointing. Definitely not \"chef inspired\"! The atmosphere was like any small town neighbourhood pub. Very loud music. Kind of more like and old saloon vibe."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. The two stars are for the decor. But the mulled wine tasted like hot wine, the food was far too greasy, and it was like glorified pub good. Ugh."}
{"text":"This place was so good, we went here twice in a  week! Has to be our new place in this area.
The ambience, perfect! Both times we went, we saw more adults, of ages. There were so many locals that seem to come regularly. The staff knew them by name, which was impressive to me.
The service is excellent. The first time service was the best. Second time, i think it was because they were busy, or could be where we sat.
The food - honourable mentions:
Calamari - has to be one of the best i've had anywhere!
Crab cake sliders - WOW!
Bulgogi Chicken Tacos - another wow!
Boarito is fun and wow!
Ribs and Gnocchi was amazing.
Everything else was excellent as well; the house salad, Steak Frites, etc...
I am not sure if I could comment on the dessert, they are probably the only thing that is mediocre. I may not be the best judge in this area.

All in all, such a great place."}
{"text":"We love to eat so I guess you could call us foodies. This place was amazing! I had a Dark and Handsome cocktail which was delicious. All the small bites and mains were amazing (Special shout out to the cauliflower fritters; calamari; sliders; Mangolian satays --- my favourite). 

We'll definately be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Menu selections, quality of food is also amazing , fun lively place, great service too!! Go there !!"}
{"text":"Came in about a half hour before closing but needing something to eat. We were told upfront only salads and pizza which was fine. Very friendly staff, they made us feel welcomed. They have local wines as well as others. Ordered pizza with sausage peppers. It was fabulous. Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Amazing service. The food. Omg the food WOW amazing. 
Mango lemonade was tasty. 
Great menu lots of choice. 
Fresh cut fried calamari. 
Outside terrace is so peaceful."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around 7:30pm. They don't take reservations around this time, it's first come, first serve. 

Ambience - the place is located in the heart of Oakville lakeshore, by the beautiful lake. Great location for a summer stroll before or after dinner. It's is a good size restaurant, with a very rustic and woody's feel to it, but done in a fun and modern way with dim lighting. 

Service - my bf and I had great service the whole night. Although the place was jam packed, we only waited about 10-15 minutes for a table. One detail I really like about Plank is how the hostess seated us immediately once a table was free. She asked us beforehand if we mind sitting in the back of the resto, and it was a 6 person table for two people. Usually, restos reserve larger tables for larger groups and make you wait until a 2-4 person table opens up. Our waitress was very friendly and came by 1-2 times during the meal to ask how everything was. All the food came out at a good pace too. 

Food - the food is great! I definitely recommend! We had the duck poutine, big bird pizza and sliders. Everything was delicious, great temperature and good portions. The poutine was delicious and the cheese was super stringy (how you know they make poutine right!). I wish the poutine had a tad bit more gravy, but since the fries are thin, it was okay because it didn't absorb too much of the sauce. The sliders were super moist and juicy and the pizza was very flavourful! My bf and I really enjoyed all the dishes we had and would definitely order it again! 

Recommendation - I highly recommend Plank for a casual night out with friends or for a date. It's not too noisy or quiet, and has a good amount of liveliness for a Friday night out. Great location, service and food. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've ever had tapas and I've gotta say, what a fantastic way to eat!  It's similar to eating Thai, in that it's best when shared with a group where everyone gets a dish and shares it amongst themselves while imbibing copious amounts of libations.
      Between four of us, I think we ordered eight dishes.  The calamari was lightly battered and avoided the two sins of calamari preparation:  being too greasy, being too rubbery.  They had a Moroccan pizza which came to our table unintentionally.  We were all hungry so we decided to try the chick-pea, zucchini-laced dish.  What a pleasant surprise (and that's coming from a guy who doesn't like zucchini!)  The steak-poutine was also excellent and easily one of the best steaks that I've had.
    Ambience is awesome and the staff is very friendly.
    The only reason that they lose a star is that I ordered their cranberry-infused Mojito and I found it lacked anything memorable.  It honestly felt like it had been watered-down.  Maybe the bartender was new, or perhaps this is their way of saving a few pennies.  I foolishly ordered two more because they went down so easy, hoping that my first one was a dud.  But sadly that wasn't the case.  
    However don't let that discourage you from going to a fun social place with great quality food.  If you're looking to order alcohol, just stick with the sure-things and you'll have a five-star experience!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Oakville! Tucked away at the end of the Oakville Burlington border is a great little restaurant serving some of the most delicious dishes the GTA has to offer. But bewared due to its popularity, you'll need to make reservations even if you're planning to meet during the week night.

It's a small intimate pub setting, good for small parties or a family dinner night out. The menu is not extensive but the quality of the menu is quite outstanding. Some of their asian inspired dishes are the best I've tasted in the GTA and I would likely go back just to eat it again (Bugogi chicken stir fry.) They have a decent selection on tap but they're wine list is priced very well and they have some great options especially for red wine drinkers like myself!

As I previously mentioned, the food was outstanding. The highlight of my deal was The Holy braise. The holy braise changes daily based on the cut of meat available. I had the braised beef short ribs with mash potato fritters and broccoli and cheese. The beef was so tender a simple pull with the fork was enough to take it apart with no effort. A knife was even necessary for the dish! 

Everyone in Oakville needs to come here at least once! If you haven't yet, this should be a priority!"}
{"text":"Great service but mediocre food. Nothing to rant about here. Cocktails were not great either"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a couple of times, and everything is great! Delicious tapas, great ambience. My favourite place in Oakville so far!"}
{"text":"Food if decent. Place is far too crowded. But it is fun and helps breathe life into Bronte. Recommended."}
{"text":"You'll have a love at first bite moment if you try the albacore tuna poke on the Plank menu. It was my favourite out of the four items I tried on the menu, followed by fried duck wings in a lemon pepper dry rub. I enjoyed the fish tacos, although I wish the taco shell was softer and more fresh. The fried chicken was good, but underwhelming after trying the tuna and wings. You'll love the atmosphere though and the friendly staff. I'll definitely go back to try other items. The bourbon drinks are a bit pricey, but delicious."}
{"text":"I've been a fairly regular customer and I am pleased the menu has been recently revised with some excellent tasty additions. As always the staff are pleasant, efficient and accommodating with great attitude. The major downside for parties at tables of four or more is that at 6.00 pm the background music is elevated to disco levels so conversation is virtually impossible. It means people start to shout so we have a cacophony on sound that is extremely challenging. So if you are on a date, don't expect a intimate or romantic conversation. Apart from a pizza that went MIA, food was excellent. Wine list could be improved.... just a passing grade. With summer coming eating outside could be a good option for the hearing impaired!"}
{"text":"I loved the feel of Plank, with wood planks covering every inch of the walls, tastefully placed art alongside a giant wood framed mirror, mismatched, retro wooden chairs, tea lights inside mason jars aglow at each table, and menus presented on planks of wood. If all I was looking for was a place that welcomed me with its charm from the moment I walked in, this would be it. 

While service was great, they didn't have their only soup item prepped for the evening, so I had to order something else to go with my shortrib Yorkers. I decided to split a baked Mac & cheese with a friend. It was good, but I like my Mac and cheese without the frills, so I would have preferred they not put bacon in it. In addition, despite the bacon, it lacked salt. 

The yorkies were ok (though my friend, who also ordered them, said she LOVED them and can't wait to order them again), but there was too much fat left on the rib meat, and my husband's Yorkshire pudding is better. There was also a strong red wine flavor, which was a bit overpowering, in my opinion. 

Our server did a fantastic job, and was a little embarrassed when he went to offer us after- dinner coffee, when he realized nobody had made the coffee yet (it was after 6 p.m.!). 

The music was absolutely BLARING (needs caps because that's how loud it was), making conversation difficult to impossible. As if that wasn't bad enough, they were playing Lynnard Skynard and other similar artists that I avoid like the plague. Because of the acoustics in the room, the volume of the conversation without the music was already louder than most pubs I've been in. When the volume of the music was turned up, I finally gave up on talking because I couldn't hear anything my friends said in reply, and I'm sure they tired of me asking, \"What?\" repeatedly. 

No soup, no coffee, fatty meat, less than flavorful Mac & cheese, and blaring music trump great service and charming decorations. I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Tried it because we were looking for a decent patio in the Oakville area by the water. The weather sent us inside but, Wow!, what an experience!
Many menu items looked interesting but my wife and I shared the tuna tartare, sliders, and steak frites. Each bite of each item was a 5/5 - so incredibly tasty!
The soy in the tartare with crema and sesame was lovely. Both the burger and steak were perfectly cooked and full of flavour. 
The service was also outstanding - Rich was attentive but not overbearing, gave excellent suggestions and checked with the kitchen when we asked more about the chimichurri and the crema.
We might go back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Was back home in Oakville (visiting from Los Angeles) for a week and decided to try this lively bar/restaurant with my Mom for lunch. I had the Pork tacos and my Mom had the sliders. Both meals were delicious and reasonably priced. The service was attentive and friendly. We would recommend and I will certainly be back. Remember to make a reservation because they get booked up, especially at dinner time."}
{"text":"Service was nice and quick.  The food was good.  For a tapas bar I usually expect a higher elevation in flavour.  The atmosphere was thriving however, really hard to hear across the table.  We were a party of eight so it may be relative.

Food and drink came out very fast which was a pleasant surprise.  The calamari was not as great as the reviews however, it was delicious.  The duck poutine lived up to the reviews and was excellent.  The lobster mac and cheese was lacking seasoning and flavour overall.  It had lobster in it but no flavour.  The pizza was very nice.  The chicken and waffles was good but not as good as say triple a in Toronto.  The chimichurri sauce for the steak was excellent as well.  The cut of beef was good.  The beef tacos are a pass.  We felt the shell sucked every bit of saliva in the mouth they were so dry.

Overall should be a four but relative to the locale I would give a 3.5 rounding down to a 3.  

I would try it one more time to give it another chance and will re-review again.  Let's hope it was a busy season issue rather than the norm."}
{"text":"Such an incredible place!  My family was visiting from California for 4 nights and we ended up eating at Plank all 4 nights.  Staff was extremely welcoming, the food was delicious and the music and ambiance brought out the liveliness.  Favorite food items were the House Sliders, Little Rocket Man, Mac Daddy, and Sausage & Pepper Pizza, but it is hard to go wrong on any selection."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at Plank and actually I have never even been there. So how do I write a review and give a 5 star rating at that. Well...here's why.

I was looking to send a restaurant gift card as a b'day gift for my sister who lives in the area.  I live in San Francisco BTW. It turns out to be more difficult that I thought to find a card online that could be delivered electronically. Come on Canada!

I decided to call Plank since they had good reviews and see if there was a way to purchase a gift card through the phone and get it out to my sister. I was lucky to get Melody when I called.  Since I only had a day to get the gift out to my sister, she offered to go personally drop it off!! What?? Awesome! This is customer service! Melody deserved a raise and a promotion."}
{"text":"This is by Far one of the best resturants downtown oakville.What a great venue overlooking the harbour. 
We sat outside which has such a lovely atmosphere , but were kindly helped inside after it started to pour with rain.
The place is jammed packed with people, and when the food arrived I could see why.
The portions are much smaller than normal , except for the deep fried cauliflower  ,which was highly recommended. 
Im a serious Carnivore and didn't think much, but thought I would give the starter a try.
It was the best thing on the menu for sure.
my wife forgot her purse full of cash and all her cards , drivers license ect, and when we called them a week later they had it safely put away.
The staff here are super friendly and can't help and serve enough.
Wish I could find 7 stars."}
{"text":"Plank is a.) chalk full of some interesting tapas & b.) whaddya know, a bourbon bar!

I was super excited to try this place after checking out the menu & popped by here after a day-long Oakville crawl.

I ordered an Old Fashioned which was good, but would have been better without ice because mine melted before I drank it all and got all watery.

Heres what we sampled food-wise (note: I SOOO wanted to try the sausage stuffed chicken wings, but they don't have them on the menu anymore! :( )

Cauliflower Fritters: deep fried & a little too greasy for me. The batter wasn't great. Very bland tasting.
Deep Fried Chicken: even greasier than the cauliflower fritters. This one made me feel a bit sick due to all the grease!
House Sliders: A-Ok. Meat a little overdone, and I would have preferred them more rare, but still tasty.
Chicken Tacos: DELISH. I'm a pretty slow eater generally but I gobbled this down super fast! Really nice flavours that work well together and the pineapple salsa ROCKS!
D'Italiano Pizza: Also A-Ok. Not the best pizza I've ever eaten, but I do love me some cheesy, prosciuttoey goodness! 

They had a dessert menu, and usually I am a dessert FIEND, but the only dessert that really interested me they were out of (sadface x2)

Overall it was decent, and the service was pretty knowledgeable, friendly, and fast, but this place was definitely missing a wow factor for me. However, I'd definitely come back to try out more items on the new tapas menu and to give this place a second chance, because this place definitely has the potential to be awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm going to forgo the analogy of how I should've walked off a Plank before we decided to eat here and just say this entire meal was a disaster from start to finish. 

I'd been here before with one of my cousins and had a decent time but today's experience was a clusterf*** in its entirety. 

We decided to take my grandpa out for brunch for his birthday. My dad had made a reservation yesterday and the manager explained there would be a table of 40 dining at the same time. We were fine with that, decided to proceed with the reservation. 

Intended to come here for brunch, but the restaurant wasn't serving it because of this fabulous table of 40 that seemed to take precedence over every other diner in here. Alright ... We proceeded with the regular menu and were thoroughly disappointed. 

My grandpa asked for white bread, they brought hard multigrain and when the white bread did come out it was hella burnt. My steak frites - overcooked , fries not salty enough too much blue cheese butter sauce and not enough chimmichurri, but overall meh. 

All the food was brought to the table at different times so we were all disappointed at different times as well. I honestly can't blame the waitress because she's been more than apologetic and doing her best to accommodate us so kudos to her. 

Likely won't be back or recommend this place to anyone I know, but hope the table of 40 was happy."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place and the service is always awesome! Make sure you get their steak frites or poutine!"}
{"text":"So after reading many reviews it seems as though Plank is a \"hit-or-miss\" resto bar. My take is that regulars will like this place more and first time visitors might love it assuming they go at non-peak hours.

To begin with, Plank is the life of the party in an otherwise sleepy area of Oakville. Its that one place with the lights still on when everything else has shut down. Our experience was not unlike several other reviews....the staff is friendly, seating quality varies and the lights are way to low for you to really see what the dishes look like.

The menu is \"inspired\" for a pub with a great variety of  appetizers and entrees. We ordered the Dumb Son wontons and the dumplings as appetizers. the dumplings were great but the wontons had enough salt to preserve a cow! I mean it was unbelievably salty so we returned them and ordered more dumplings. For the main course we ordered the Lobster Mac 'N Cheese and the Peruvian Chicken Salad. Both dishes were good although a bit on the smallish side or too expensive for their size.

The environment is chalet-like with lots of folks sharing conversations at laughs at the bar. There is table seating along one wall, with some larger tables at the front and 3, hi-tips for 4 at the back (an areas which seems oddly separate from the rest of the place.

Overall our experience was good except for the Dumb Son beef wontons, which were really bad (soggy and salty). If I did go back it would be to have a few drinks and appetizers at the bar after having a nicer dinner at another place."}
{"text":"Best calamari. During the summer this place is very cool. Outdoor tables overlooking the lake resembles Venice. Its pricey but worth the wait. Upscale Oakville dining. I had the octopus and it was nice. The steaks nothing crazy. Burgers are probably tastiest"}
{"text":"Got a recommendation for this restaurant from a friend. Was in the area so stopped in for breakfast/brunch on  Sunday am.

Very pleased with our meal & the service! The resto is decorated with a very rustic feel & has many repurposed items (which is good for someone who is eco-conscious like me to see!!).

Cauliflower fritters - love love loved these! Flavorful & great with the tartar/dill sauce...wouldn't have known they were cauliflower if I hadn't ordered them myself. 

Pecan chicken & waffles: yum!! Well cooked chicken (not with a crisp crust like kfc or others so seems more baked in crust than fried). The maple bourbon sauce was interesting, kind of like a version of southern style gravy. The waffles were good, had a nice hint of vanilla. Not too fluffy but still good. It was served with potato hash which I don't really care for....

DH had salad with his eggs Benedict & enjoyed it all! 

We didnt have any cocktails so might be back to try those & some tapas:-)"}
{"text":"Went late for drinks and had some of there small bites. We absolutely loved it. Service was good . Food was great . We tried 4 bites - calamari - cauliflower - dumplings - wontons .... all where great - I would say the least favourite was the wonton - but I still ate them - they still tasted good. My new favourite  local place. I would definitely try this place out ."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at anybody rating this 3.  If you think this place is a 3, your standards are much too high!  I rarely give out 5's but this place is very, very close.

Amazing location with breathtaking view of Bronte Harbour.  Nice, slightly classy decor, open cooking facilities behind bar.  Very cozy friendly place with incredible staff, friendly, helpful & efficient.  Food all looked excellent with some very unique presentations.

Smaller place that probably fills up some nights.  I'm a fan, I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times recently. I've been usually quite impressed with the food although the service was poor in both times. On my first time, the service was slow and our orders came in different times - we were a table of five, and some of us were already finished while others were still waiting for their food. Not good. 

On my second time the service was even worse. It was just two of us and we ordered four appetizers. First we received something we did not even order after like 20 min. It was cauliflower fritters ( not a fan, way too greasy and lacks flavor). Our fish tacos came afterwards. Our calamari never came and when we asked about it like half an hour later our server told us that they did not have calamari. We also never received our fourth appetizer. The shishito peppers were actually quite tasty. It was overall not a pleasant experience. Most food came to table late so they were almost cold or not crispy at all. Cauliflower fritters were saggy and very greasy. Fish tacos were not bad. The drinks were okay but nothing too fancy. I guess it is a unique place regarding the beautiful outdoor view. You can also find parking easily in the area."}
{"text":"The food was good and the restaurant had a comfortable atmosphere. With small portions you want to try everything on the menu but be careful the bill can add up fast! The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because we felt rushed. The waitress cleared plates even before we were finished. I would definitely give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Does not take reservations Fridays and Saturdays. Not an option if you don`t live nearby. Service is average for the prices."}
{"text":"Holy cow! If you're in this area, do yourself a favor and eat here. The good is delicious, especially the Poutine. I was in the area for work and took a client here. We both decided that it was the best restaurant that we had been to the whole time we were in the Toronto area. The servers are awesome too. We had asked if the ice cream shop down the street was open and they didn't know but one of their employees walked down to check it out for us and report back. So great!"}
{"text":"I just wish I could report the food was on par with the 4.5 star service, but alas I can't.
The one star Edamame Guacamole is a strange concoction that likely sports half the calories of its more conventional brethren but sadly 1% of the taste. And the accompanying chips and mini pittas served as equally tasteless vessels to our mouths.
The two star pork tacos were just ok and the battered cauliflower just slightly more appetizing.
The perfectly cooked and garnished Slider were very close to four star highlight of the night.
The very happy staff helped but not enough to return."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  Delicious tapas style sharing menu items and busy ambiance on a weekday (mostly locals from Oakville I would guess), lots of wood in the decor.  Before this place I did not even know there was a Bronte downtown, which is a cute little hangout with a few well known pubs and restaurants in the neighbourhood.  Anyway, back to the menu, sliders and ahi tuna were super and flavourful, beef rolls were fried but good, and short ribs were well done and reasonable as well, the best item we had however was the egg plant, which had this sweet crispy (maple?) coating on it that made them quite unique.  For desert the cannoli dip was a let down, read cannoli DIP with wafers not cannolis, better just to go for the original at a good Italian joint.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent!! I'm going back for sure! Loved everything about this place including the location! Very tasty cuisine!"}
{"text":"Great service, very fresh food- calamari was super fresh! Huge portions for the \"small bites\" menu items, view of the water, Wine list is short but overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Interesting place...it feels like a pub...but it has a decent wine list (served in proper wine glasses), the food is delicious and has somewhat of an Asian twist. We went here at around 6pm on a Thursday night and they were already busy, packed by the time we left. It's in what appears to be a great location right across the street from the harbor. Our waitress was super friendly, personable and efficient. I had the steak and frites. The fries were skinny and crispy (how I like it) and the steak was tender and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Brunch of dreams!

My first time at Plank was for Easter brunch - and the breakfast menu is really really awesome!

I wanted to try just about everything on the menu, but I went with Huevos Rancheros and the special, Chicken and Waffles (yay for significant others that want to split things!). I'm hoping to go back in the future and try the stuffed french toast, one of the pizzas, or really anything.. absolutely everything looked great!

The best thing about this place, is that the prices are super reasonable. $12 for a brunch item is fine by me! They also serve up mimosas and casears, brunch's best friends! 

I honestly can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday and thought the food was just ok. It's very busy and hard to hear the people at your table."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try based on the raving Yelp reviews... Was not disappointed! Not giving 5 stars because they didn't have any cucumbers for my Hendricks & Tonic, no oysters on the menu that day and the octopus on special was overdone. All small things but that would've made it a 5* :) Overall an excellent experience and I'll attribute it to the superb service we received from our server and the floor manager. New fav spot in Oakville!"}
{"text":"This place constantly changes up the menu and offers an amazing atmosphere.   Pizzas are amazing, short rib yorkies are unreal and the salads are fun and flavourful.  Can't say enough good things about this place - good for a date, girls night or family dinner! There's a sexy bartender too ahhah"}
{"text":"Good food, great service  and awesome location 
A little loud but definitely recommended."}
{"text":"What a find. Oh my what a find.

This tapas style eatery was an opentable find.  My wife and I got a gift card  from them and decided to give it a try.

Plank is located in down town Oakville, on Bronte Rd. just south of Lakeshore.

The decore is very rustic and homey.  The wood panelling adds a very warm and inviting touch.

It is very small though.  There are about 12 tables so I recommend you make a reservation beforehand.
  
Small plates are the theme of the night.  Ordering from the bits and bites section of the menu is a great way to get a feel for what they offer.

The highlights were the salt and pepper calamari, and the cauliflower fritters.  

My wife and I are calamari lovers who will  not hesitate to order it wherever we can.  As was the same here at Plank.

It was very unique, the batter was light which was refreshing.  It was the perfect balance of salty and acidic.  The texture was expertly contrasted by the meaty-ness of the calamari.

It was paired with their \"kick - ass\" cocktail sauce.  This is where it lost a little for me.  Unlike most cocktail sauces which are mild, it definitely kicked my ass.  The chef was a little to heavy on the horseradish which made it way to strong and gave it a smoky after taste.

The cauliflower fritters were amazing. They were light and delicious.

The batter was crunchy and the texture of the cauliflower was smooth and creamy.  Everything was so well balanced.  Just brilliant.

The fritters were paired with a rich cheese sauce that complimented the fritters very well.

The whole meal, 5 different bits and bites, one pint and a ginger ale came to 71 dollars with tip.

Great services, great food, a must try."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing the menu for quite some time and finally did the trek to Oakville for Sunday brunch. The place is small but very kitschy with the wood decor - hence the name PLANK. As we checked in for our reservation, we were greeted with a smile and hello by three of the servers. It was a nice, warm welcome. 

We ordered drinks - Sunshine and Bubbly and a Kentucky Breakfast. I really like how they have a limited selection for brunch cocktails and they are all $6. As for our meal, we ordered the Crispy Pigs Ear Salad (delicious, don't be deterred or turned off by pigs ear, it's really crispy and a great complement to the Caesar salad), Pecan Fried Chicken (with waffles and pork belly hash) and Biscuits & Gravy. Everything was so simple and tasty but with a unique twist. We have definitely found a new brunch place and will return again soon. 

We also want to go back to try out their dinner menu and cocktails."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night around 7 pm and it was packed! We were told it would be about a 30-45 minute wait, and were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. 45 minutes turned into over an hour and the restaurant sent us out some complimentary fried pizza dough balls in marinara sauce. This was an awesome gesture!

I think I misunderstood the menu though. I thought the \"bits and bites\" were small plates rather than sharing plates so I ordered the bubbahummus for myself, which was a huge portion (and no one else wanted to help me eat it because they ordered too much food too!). It came with pizza crust brushed with olive oil, salt, and garlic rather than pita bread which I thought was really cool. I also got the fall for squash salad, which wasn't anything special (although I had to have the spiced walnuts left off because of allergies) and could have used way more cheese than just 4 thin slices. I should have ordered the duck poutine - my boyfriend's was delicious!

Overall it wasn't bad but I think once I try a few more items off the menu I'll be more impressed."}
{"text":"I really want to like Plank Restobar.

Great location, right by the the Lake. Love the deco: clean and rustic. Service is wonderful. Great selection of Bourbon and Bourbon cocktails.

The food though was kind of Meh. But by the time I wrote this review, they would have a brand new menu. Hopefully for the better!

We shared:

Fried Chicken ($9)
- the sauce was kind of sweet and sour (10 year old bourbon Habanero orange glaze). but just tasted bland

Cauliflower Fritter ($7)
- was not good... bland tasting
- proves that deep frying things doesn't make it tasty!

House Sliders ($8)
- the meat were really dry.....

D'Italiano Organic tomato sauce, prosciutto, arugula, shaved Parmesan ($16)
- not bad, but the pizza itself was kind of soggy 

Smoked Chicken Tacos ($8)
- the best dish for this evening, good smokey flavour 

I might give Plank another try if I am in the area. Maybe just have a drink or 2. The drink menus definitely looks great!"}
{"text":"Service is second to none. Timed perfectly between courses. Duck poutine is a must try. Great atmosphere and perfect location by the waterfront. Reservations recommended as this is a local hotspot. Bar and food are fairly priced for a premium product."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation from a coworker and were so glad we did!! Quaint atmosphere and a rustic design. Had a nice patio area where you could dine and take in views of Lake Ontario.  Ordered the Duck Poutine and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Not too greasy and fries were perfect!!  I also had the Grilled Cheese with artichoke walnut pesto and smoked bacon... it worked so well that my mouth is watering thinking of it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, definitely not an ordinary menu, everything we tried was delicious. The cauliflower fritters were amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. Went there for valentine's day and had a great time with my wife and friends. Enjoyed all the food. The Cochinita tacos highly recommended for their authenticity and deliciousness or the steak frites, the oysters and the gazpacho. Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star review except for the following: the server was curt and rude for the first three quarters of the meal. She didn't bother with the niceties or even a hello etc. suddenly her mood cleared towards the last 30 minutes and she was friendly. That really takes away from an otherwise fantastic place and really great food. 
Another thing to mention was that when our order was brought out wrong, she grabbed the food from the table, told us that she placed the order with the kitchen correctly,scowled and walked away. No apologies at all. I mean - wow, talk about bad service. I also specially called and requested a window side seating - for which the gentleman on the phone made a huge fuss about and told me they don't take reservations at all on any day. I logged into open table and made a reservation for the same time. Thank you for the lie - great way to keep the customers happy. 

On the food front do not miss the foie gras poutine and the sliders - you will not regret it! The 3 stars on this review are for the fantastic patrons of this restaurant and the great food - not the service."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  

Went here on a Sunday evening with a friend. My coworker recommended me to come here. 
The decor was nice and very fitting to the name of the restaurant.  
We sat at the back near the washrooms. 
 
We ordered 5 dishes : 
1. Wagon Wheel pizza
Roasted mushrooms, truffle oil, rosemary, fior di latte, basil pesto
-No bold flavour, nice and simple pizza, good thin crust. 
-Doesn't burn your mouth when you take a bite.
 
2. Ahi Tuna Poke
-Served on a spoon
-Bit of crunch on the bottom 
-great flavour 
- comes with lime and ginger on the side 
- would order again 

3. Bone marrow
-needs some salt. 
-overpriced
-would order again if it had more salt
-falls out of the bone and off the plate (be careful) 

4. Lobster Mac and Cheese 
-meat of one lobster claw
-sprinkled with bacon which is the salt element to the plate
-not super cheesy, more greasy.

5. Strawberry Shortcake  
-Good flavour. 
-Needs a bit more strawberries.  

 
I would come here again and try more food. We were going to order the Kalbi tacos but they said they ran out of beef. We were just relieved we were able to try the bone marrow.
The chef has different dessert options every night so there isn't a dessert menu. $5 each.
 Overall, I felt like the dishes could use a tad more salt but it was pretty good food.  Would come back here again."}
{"text":"Went twice. First time for my bf's bday, second time for mine. Cute place by the water. We got a great seat the first time by the fireplace. Our server was super bubbly and friendly. We found this place from the taste of Oakville. Ordered 2 items from that menu and 1 from the regular menu. Food and drinks were good but just have to keep in mind it's more tapas style so smaller portions for the price. Only complaints are that she charged us all the regular prices. We had a bit to drink so didn't notice till after and then didn't want to complain and get her in trouble since she was pregnant and nice, so chose not to ruin our nice evening over money. I did mention to her that it was his bday but he wasn't offered anything even if i had to pay.

Second time we were stuck by the door at a lil table. Once again consistent the food and drinks were good but it was difficult to get our servers attention. She came maybe twice throughout our whole dinner.

Food i'd give them 4 stars but I'm giving them 3 because of what happened."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a late lunch here yesterday. The atmosphere is nice, the decor reminded us both of something you might see in a ski town.

The food was excellent, they have a fairly good drink selection, and portion sizes are good. Our server was attentive and very nice.

It was very busy when we arrived, and after eating here I can see why it's so popular. It's also right across the street from a little park, which makes for a nice after dinner walk."}
{"text":"Love it! I was visiting with a Co-worker from Los Angeles and everyone made us feel so welcomed! The owner and staff were great. And Bruno was hilarious. Now to the food. Everything we had was superb. Not just good but excellent. The flavors were so well developed. We had the bacon wrapped dates, baked brie, mussels, and D'Italiano pizza. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Canada!"}
