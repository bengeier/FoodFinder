{"text":"Loved it!!! Took my whole family. Got tickets on Groupon for cheaper. Lines were insane & it was freezing cold out on the night we went. Parking was super far! Walking with kids through the park in the dark & in the freezing cold to get to the place, I wasn't too happy about. Seeing the displays fixed my mood tho. Everything was so cool!!! Very worth seeing. Kids loved it as well. Didn't get a chance to see shows or eat the foods tho. We were just trying to get through the cold & see everything in a good amount of time. Great photo ops!! I suggest go before the sun really goes down to get some brighter shots. It's hard for the pics to really come out nice when it's super dark. The bright lights of the displays are good by themselves when taking a pic of it but with you in it, not so great. You come out dark.  Especially phone pics. I had to angle my phone in so many ways to get a decent shot of the kids with the displays. This is our first yr going. Definitely would go again. If you haven't been, you must go!!! It's so cool!"}
{"text":"Really Beautiful light displays and such a fun event to attend! Will definitely go back if they have this again"}
{"text":"Nice place to walk off your dinner or they have vendors that sell food and snacks.  Recommend bundling up since it's a bit chilly. Lots of cool lanterns w/ tidbits of fun facts to expand your knowledge of the Asian culture."}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure what to expect at this, but I definitely was pleasantly surprised at the colors and the lights. It's worth a visit once but not sure about more than once though. 

Pictures don't do justice...

Also I purchased a Groupon which sweetened the deal a bit."}
{"text":"Beautiful Chinese Lanterns.  It was very cold so we didn't stay long, but the kids really loved it."}
{"text":"A very beautiful and unique event that is taking place in town right now. As everyone else, got my tickets through Groupon for $14. The Groupon also comes with mobile guide. General admission for adults is $20 and an additional $5 for the mobile guide. Although we paid for the guide, we didn't use it. 

The lanterns were so pretty in person and the festival was bigger than I had expected, so it was worth the money. Each piece is sponsored by a community organization and even if you don't use the mobile guide, each piece has information about what it is about and its meaning. 

I also really loved that they decided to do this at Craig Ranch Park. It's not centrally located, but the park itself is huge and clean: perfect spot for something like this. 

We spent about an hour here. There were food and good vendors if anyone happens to be concerned about that. However, they are pricey. I paid $8 for deep fried oreos (5). Also, dress warmly because it gets very cold in the park at night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this event.. i didnt enjoy the parents that can't follow rules and have to put thier children in/on the displays for a picture. What they are teaching thier children is \"that rules dont apply to me \"attitude.  But, other than that it was a beautiful set up uf lights."}
{"text":"Gorgeous display of exquisitely-crafted, hand-painted large silk lantern displays. As you can see from the photos, there is a variety of themed exhibits, on display through February 25. On February 16, Chinese New Year's, tickets will cost an additional $10 for that night's special celebration.

For the best photo opps, I suggest buying the VIP tickets. You'll get in a half-hour early, which was enough time for us to scope out the displays and take photos before and following sunset without having to wait for people to clear out of the way (which is not an easy task if you are there on a beautiful weekend evening, as we were). Once general admission people started coming through the gate, families and kids were everywhere. Even so, the exhibits are spread out very  well along meandering paths, the gazebo and the pond. VIPs also have great parking, easy entrance, and the option to take a short tour or use your free mobile guide tour through your cellphone. We also received a wooden fan and could participate in a Lion Dance parade (we didn't do that). Your VIP pass is only good for the evening you designate.

Hubby wanted to try out his new camera and I enjoyed filling my camera roll with the illuminated displays. My cellphone camera *loved* the colors! We made this a date \"day\" of all-Asian festivities, including the Bellagio display, the Samurai Exhibit, this festival, and a Thai dinner. Love life in Vegas!

Not too many food vendors the night we went, but you won't go hungry.  Grab some of that scrumptious kettle popcorn for the ride home."}
{"text":"4.5

We bought a Groupon for 4. Our first time to this park, the man directing traffic had us park in a dirt parking lot which was on the other side of the park, thus had to walk quite a distance..

(Note to all: not a doggy friendly event, furry friends cannot enter) 

I had read up on the reviews about the long queue and expected it (got here at 6:45), however it was quite disorganized. Got in line, waited about 20 mins, then sent someone in our group to the front to inquire if there was a line strictly for guests with a prepurchased ticket and were told no, but that there were 3 lines. Headed up to queue in a shorter line (the middle one). After a while, security came up and told us to tell others that  the line would be ending after us.

As we approached ticketing, there were only two ticket takers so we in the third middle line had to somehow squeeze in but could imagine that people in the other two lines would get irritated that we were basically cutting. Imagine our embarrassment..  

Besides the hectic process entering, the experience was quite enjoyable. We didn't use the mobile guide, just read the information about each display. For those with strollers and wheelchairs, the bumps can be cumbersome but can't be helped. The grounds were clean. 

The only port-a-potty we came across was located to the left of the terra cotta warriors. For those looking for the performance area, the stage is by the biggest, longest dragon display on the grass area. 

Overall, great idea for a family/date night. The park was very spacious for this event. All the lantern displays were beautifully made, pleasantly presented and well taken care of."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I personally loved it. We felt like kids looking at these mesmerizing lights filled with beauty for the first time. The walk wasn't too long nor short and that's what makes it great for me. Food was delicious, gifts were worth buying and the show was one of the best parts (besides the lights). Overall we had a great experience. The only thing that I disliked was.....the price. $20 per person. Not a fan of that price but hey, if you want to have a good time sometimes you have to spend a little extra money. (Just go through Groupon for a discount)  ; )"}
{"text":"Bought some tickets for my boyfriend, bestfriend, 4 foster kids, and one of their friends.  The displays were beautiful and the show was decent.  The only problem I had was the way I was treated by one of the food vendors.  He was a Chinese man that saw that I was  next in line but completely ignored me while he helped another family that arrived AFTER me and was BEHIND me.  I interrupted and reminded him that I had been waiting.  Everyone around us got quiet and just watched as he decided to assist me, but with attitude.  The other vendors who were in his booth smirked and  scoffed at me. All I wanted was to buy lemonades for the kiddos.  Unsure if I was treated like this due to the color of my skin, but it definitely ruined the night."}
{"text":"I thought China lights was awesome! Small and quaint. It's not big so it takes maybe couple of hours to explore everything. We ate, got gifts and watched the show they had. I see people complaining about the wait in line so I'd suggest the \"Golden Circle Pass\" on Groupon. Early access at 5pm. Also parking is on left side of the park. We parked on commerce side (right side of park) and had to walk further than other people lol!"}
{"text":"We went earlier this year when the event was going on here in Vegas and it was so much fun! It was quite cold out still and the wind was blowing fairly strongly, causing the evening performances and fireworks displays to be cancelled. Even so we still had a great time walking among the lanterns, listening to music and enjoying each other's company. There were several vendors and we tried some stir fried noodles and freshly made mini donuts! They were both delicious and hot, much appreciated on the cold night."}
{"text":"The lanterns are very beautiful! Very fun night for the family. Worth the small fee charged."}
{"text":"Truly breathtaking...the whole family came to witness the new spectacle that finally came to Las Vegas \"Chinese Lantern Festival!\"

From the beginning you enjoy all the Chinese Zodiac animals and soon get immersed in such amazing sculpted lantern artworks. Take your time and read each informative writing to teach you what you are viewing. Near the Terra Cotta Chinese soldiers is the nightly show. Get there early if you want a seat, but anything near will be spectacular as you watch in amazement. 

We tried plenty of food and perused the trinkets for sale, the aluminum sculptures were quite intricate as well as the inner bottle painting. 

Plenty of photo opportunities and memories to be made with the family. Hopefully they return again next year so we can create some more local traditions."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I didn't rate this a couple of weeks ago-- hopefully this becomes an annual event and you can check it out next year.   We had a groupon, but would pay full price in the future.   SPECTACULAR!!!   Beautiful lights and displays.   Friendly service from staff and vendors.  Performers were talented and we an overall fantastic time!   Fun for all ages-- highly recommend."}
{"text":"The lights were absolutely beautiful! I hope they come back next year! A great location for them to set up as well. My daughter really enjoyed it. She is two. You also learn about what each lantern represents and more about the Chinese culture. 10/10 I went twice."}
{"text":"Wow!! All I can say about the great job they did with the festival .  The bright lights,  decoration, lanterns, etc true to Chinese tradition"}
{"text":"Beautiful. So much to see. Great family event. Long lines to get in but worth the wait. Get there early. Not many food options. May want to eat 1st or bring in food."}
{"text":"We had a great time looking at the amazing lanterns. Next to each one was information about Te lantern and it's significant to Chinese culture. You could also listen to the audio tour to hear about the lanterns. 

There was a nice selection of food and crafts for purchase. My kids loved the pot stickers and meat on sticks. 

There was an awesome performance that showcased acrobats, contortionists and balancing acts. If you want seating you need to buy the vip ticket. Otherwise you can sit in the grass or stand."}
{"text":"The lanterns are definitely unique and beautiful to look at.  The show they had was fun to watch. I don't have children of my own but I can definitely see children enjoying this a lot."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience and do much fun. We had our kids with us but I would have gone on a date night through the park there. This was very well put together and truly a delight to see. I hope we can see more of this!"}
{"text":"Simply WOW! A Must See! I got my tickets through groupon for $14, regular price is $20 for adult. On Feb 16th is additional surcharge for $10 due to being Chinese New Year. They will have parade and other activities.

China Lights festival celebrates the art, skill, and beauty of traditional Chinese lantern festivals that have been celebrated for the last 400 years. It's a two month long building process to put all the exhibits together.

This event lasts for six weeks from Jan. 19th to Feb. 25th. Check their webcite for details. 

My bf and I came here tonight on the first day of opening. The parking is free and there was plenty of spot. The line was ok. I was so mesmerized and wowed with each illuminated displays. Each one were elaborate, colorful and gorgeous.

The acrobatic show is a must see. There are 5 acts and they were very talented and entertaining. There were some food trucks and vendor selling crafts and clothing.

Located in Craig Ranch Park in North Las Vegas. They would definitely get a bigger crowd if they move to a park more centrally located. I just loved it."}
{"text":"Holy wow! Beautiful. Just beautiful. The colors of the displays are vibrant and really pop. Some of the displays move. I couldn't take enough pictures. I'd recommend skipping the little show they put on. They kept announcing it was happening and we kept waiting. It just took up hours of our night when it was supposed to be a quick little show."}
{"text":"So cute and pretty! There's also a Groupon discount to go :) I had the mini donuts there and they were literally the best donuts I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"This year of 2018, China Lights Las Vegas is at Craig Ranch. The Lantern Festival has full scale lanterns, as well as Chinese cultural performances and special handicrafts to Las Vegas for Jan. 19th to Feb. 25th, Starting at 5:30PM - 10:00PM.  CLOSED ON MONDAYS!

For nearly 2,000 years, the Chinese New Year has been celebrated with lanterns and this festival made its first appearance ever in Las Vegas! The Chinese New Year Celebration is on Feb. 16th, 2018. So plan on getting the full CNY Experience during that time. 

The whole festiveal is presented by Tianyu Arts. Their team of artisans are from Zigong, Sichuan, China's cultural capital for the ancient art of lantern-making.

Don't forget to be on time for their performance Times: Tuesday to Thursday: 6:30 pm and 8:00 pm
Friday to Sunday 6:30 pm, 8:00 pm and 9:00pm

Buy your tickets online at Groupon! It saves you extra cash you could use for their Chinese cuisine and traditional crafts. Kids are also free under the ages of 4 years."}
{"text":"I saw this advertised on Facebook and went a few days after it opened.  The forms are made of cloth and have lights both inside and out.  It is spread over an area of the park with plenty of room to walk about, take photos, and just enjoy the displays.

Probably the one that gets the most attention would be the large dragon.  After that, the panda garden play area is good.  

There is about a 20 minute show of jugglers, tumblers, a dancer, and a balance artist.  There are chairs in this area and there was room.  I was there on a Tuesday night.  I'd expect the entertainment area to be full on weekend nights.

There were two food vendors and some Asian themed gift items in the one pavilion.

The parking and organization of the event was great!  This is a good place to take kids.  It will be there until near the end of February."}
{"text":"My family absolutely love China Lights Festival.  The sculpted lanterns were colorful, whimsical and vibrant.  Each display is well slayed out so that you can stop and enjoy each without being massed in with others.  Each night there are preformances and get ready for some yummy snacks that ready for purchase.  I recommend the mini doughnuts.  DO NOT miss this!!"}
{"text":"I initially saw about this lights festival through social media when a couple of my friends posted beautiful photos of it. I had to go. 

I live in Henderson and it is located in North Las Vegas. It was not hard to navigate, just used Maps, but when it says you're there you arrive at a park and the festival is way in the back, you can barely see it. So you have to drive through the park area way to the other side. Parking was accessible, we went a little bit late though around 9pm on a Thursday night and it was very cold so it wasn't too busy. Once you get up, there are two booths where you can buy tickets or scan your vouchers. I HIGHLY recommend to buy a voucher in advance on Groupon the price per ticket is way cheaper than buying at the door. I believe $14 compared to $20 for adults (18+). 

Once you walk in you are greeted with huge \"Happy Chinese New Year\" sign and vibrant light settings all over the area. There's set ups of aquatic creatures, dragons, normal animals, and flowers. They also have a little historic description by each setting and how it applies to Chinese new year. I would say it's about a 2 acre lot. They also have food trucks that serve \"fair food,\" like funnel cakes, fried Oreos, and lemonade, I didn't have the chance to check it out. Side night there are a lot of people taking photos so be courteous and walk around!! In the end my absolute favorite piece was the huge dragon. It stood about 35 feet, it was breathtaking! 

I definitely recommend checking this lights festival out, it was like nothing I have ever seen! Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"This exceeded my expectations and more! The lanterns were beautifully created and placed throughout park.  There was so much vibrant colors-- perfect for photo ops.  For $20 a person, it was pretty worth it. 

They also have a life performance show with Chinese acrobats and dancers, and food vendors selling yakisoba, teriyaki chicken, fried Oreos, kettle corn, corn dogs, and much more.

I highly recommend checking this out with your family.  It's perfect for all ages."}
{"text":"We came here with the children not knowing what to expect and it was a great surprise. The lights and sculptures were very well made and looked amazing at night. My son loved the fact that you can go on the website and there's a story that plays for you to accompany each station. The only drawback was that the food stations were expensive. It was also windy that night so we were very cold and some of the sculptures had fallen down. It is definitely a must see for Vegas locals. I don't see us coming every year but maybe in the future we will check it out again once the kids are older."}
{"text":"China Lights is located in North Las Vegas at Craig Ranch Park. 

We purchased our tickets through Groupon for $14 which saved us 6 bucks, regular price is $20 at the ticket booth. 

The line to get tickets and get in was pretty long when we got there around 6pm on a Saturday night. The line moved slowly so it took about 15 mins to get in. 

Once inside we walked around, looking at all the different light displays. The set up is in a section of the park which has been fenced off so you walk along the pathway. 

It definitely looked like a lot of time and effort went in to setting up these displays. 

There were a couple food booths, Yakisoba Noodles, Kettle Corn, Funnel Cakes, etc. nothing extensive. 

We spent about an hour here walking around, which seemed like plenty of time to see everything. 

Bundle up, everything is outdoors."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL! I was simply awestruck with the lanterns. 

We got to enter 30 minutes prior to opening to the public due to having VIP tickets that were purchased on Groupon, which was nice because we got to take more personal photos with the lanterns. Upon entering, you are greeted with a walkway with with the 12 zodiac lanterns which was really cute chibi forms of the zodiac signs. The lanterns are spread througout the park with information regarding the lanterns (more info comes when using the mobile guide) with plenty of room to roam around, take pictures and enjoy the scenery. If you have kids they will definetly enjoy this experience. My personal favorites were the pandas and the giant dragon (you can't miss this). 

There is also a show that consist of jugglers, acrobats, a face changing artist, a diabolo routine (Chinese yoyo), and a balance artist. There are chairs in this area reserved for the VIP guest. Do not worry though. If you missed a show, they play throughout the night.

There are also some food vendors If you get hungry near the area where they sell Asian merchandise.

Overall, I had a blast going with my friends. Got to learn a thing or two from part of my ancestry."}
{"text":"Hope it returns next year. Definitely a different and worthwhile exhibit. Beautiful and interesting! Only a few vendors though for food and trinkets."}
{"text":"Buy a ticket before coming here...the lines are LONG and if you need to purchase the ticket there it will only delay how fast the line moves. 

I visited this exhibit Saturday around 7:00pm. There were two really long lines that took about 20 minutes. There were people complaining, especially those who have problems with their knees. There was an elderly couple I felt really bad for because they had to wait in the line and I did not see a section for letting them go faster. 

Overall, the lights are really neat and I had a great time walking around. It takes about an hour to see everything. Even though there were some shows going on, they were tucked away in a corner and it was hard to get to. There was also very limited seating available which meant that a lot of people were standing and obstructing the view. 

I am glad I had the chance to see this but I wouldn't go back unless I had kids."}
{"text":"2-7-18 This is an amazing exhibit. Family friendly. Great staff. Lots of food choices including authentic Chinease food. Hot chocolate available for those chilly nights. Lots of crafts and knick knacks to buy. Make sure to bring your camera. I got a Groupon and saved a few bucks. I will definitely make this a yearly event. I loved it. I will let my photos write the rest of the review. I highly recommend for all ages!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this, the night we went was absolutely perfect weather. My 2 yr old granddaughter was kind of freaked out by the contortionist lol, but eventually she believed us that the woman was not \"broken.\""}
{"text":"Spread across the expanse of a Park the 2018 China Lights Festival presents a collection of wire and cloth displays based on traditional Chinese themes and Lunar New Year beliefs, each display complete with a bit of history and the grounds also offering several dining options, souvenir stands and performances including Chinese Dance, Yo-Yo and Hoop Jumping.

A great family friendly event for $20 per adult and $12 for kids with ample parking."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a really impressive display of China lanterns in so many bright colors and characters, the flow of displays is well thought out and Each display is better than the next. 

I had seen the FB posts but we always drove by the park during daylight hours and so I was unable to figure out where the displays where located. But tonight we hit the park around 8pm and I was able to see the lights from Craig road.

First, this is a huge park and neither myself nor my husband had been beyond the entrance. We Followed the road left off of Craig road and there are people that will direct you to parking.

Hours are 530pm to 10pm,  with a entertaining show of jugglers, dancers and 'yo-yo' girls.  Showtimes vary on the day of the week, 630pm, 8pm and last show at 9pm on Friday's and Saturday's. It's been really nice weather for 'winter' and tonight there was no wind, a light wrap was comfortable. There are benches to rest, eating areas with picnic tables, and of course there is food, crafts and photo opportunities. 

Cost at gate was $20 per adult but if you search there are discount coupons available. Fun family event!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous displays, fun atmosphere, and definitely worth seeing the huge chinese dragon one. It was towering. Would like better food vendors though that don't overprice the food."}
{"text":"The China Lights display was bigger than expected and very beautiful. The show was fun to watch. I wish there were more merchants with Chinese items for sale in the little market area with items and food for sale. It was very worth the trip."}
{"text":"The illuminated lanterns were superbly crafted and well worth seeing.  A delightful sight!  But we didn't see a show because the few seats set out were reserved, and we didn't want to sit on the lawn or stand on a cold February Sunday night.  And my party of three chose to eat afterward at Tasty China rather than spend $9.00 for a few cooked noodles out of a small box that would soon turn cold, or Kettle Corn.  Merchandise and food vendors were few but the exquisitely crafted and decorated lanterns were many.

Parking was close and ample.  But one slightly galling circumstance was that by ordering online, we wound up paying $1.50 more per festival ticket for non-existent handling than we would have had we waited to buy entry tickets in person at the event ticket booth, since festival tickets were printed on my home computer, and there was no line to buy tickets when we arrived shortly before the 5:30 p.m. opening.

Still, all considered, 4-1/2 stars overall!"}
