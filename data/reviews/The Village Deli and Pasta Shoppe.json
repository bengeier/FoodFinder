{"text":"A good tuna sandwich and good coffee right beside the go bus station. Perfect for the drive into the T Dot"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a hidden jewel in some ways. It's not really hidden in the sense that it's right at the downtown Brampton transit hub; but hidden in the sense that others not in the area for transit may overlook this place as a good coffee/bistro joint.   I'd love to try try more of their lunch items, but I've had a number of their baked goods (done in store), which are actually very good. Pretty good espresso-based drinks as well. My wife enjoys their hot chocolate.  Lots of seating, and there is wifi. They've recently done renos, bringing a nice clean feel to the place. Good prices as well."}
{"text":"The food is good, the coffee is good.... The service is horrible. The lady who works in the morning is incredibly grumpy and rude. I've been here a handful of times and it's the same everytime. Either it's a personal thing or she is just that way. But ya, good food."}
{"text":"First time i went here i forgot my lunch and past this place daily so thought id give it a try. I walked in and was not acknowledged at all. I had to walk to the other end of the counter away from the cash area that you order at. I'm vegetarian so i knew there wouldn't be many options. I asked about the lentil soup and they didn't seem to care that i was a paying customer so i just said i'll take it so i could have food for lunch and not worry about the horrible service. The soup was tasteless btw. Upon speaking with my colleagues they've had similar experiences here. Today I decided to try again, the man was very dismissive and his wife I'm assuming didn't even bother to stick around as i walked in she walked away. I asked about a grill cheese to go w the soup and he said the grill is already turned off, keep in mind it is 230 in the afternoon. So I ordered a salad and tea, but he did not even budge just stood there mumbling. I don't know if its a race thing as others have said if you aren't Portuguese forget about it, or just old school ways of delivering \"customer service\". Either way i will not be returning ."}
