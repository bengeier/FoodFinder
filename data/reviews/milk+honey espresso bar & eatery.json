{"text":"I have been living in the Valley for 30 years and this is the first time that we finally have a classy Kosher restaurant where we could have a romantic and enjoyable dinner. We had a wonderful experience with a great ambiance, good background music, with champagne.....the food was amazing! Just a very unique experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a great little kosher cafe within the JCC. All their food and treats I've had are very tasty and been satisfied. The salmon wrap is always my go to meal! There's a lot of comfortable seating and the staff is always very nice and give great service.

I know the guy who runs this cafe isn't a fan of Yelp reviewers but with all the great reviews here hopefully he can have a better outlook! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this restaurant located inside the JCC..  Great vibe and the owner and staff always make you feel special. Very tasteful Shukshuka..check out their menu..and stop by..I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I wish I could choose zero stars! Price gouging and a rude owner! Inconsistent food, inedible hummus and the most upsetting... over priced fresh squeezed orange juice. The price was always high for the OJ at $5 for the only size available. Now they offer both a large ($7.25) & small ($5) option BUT what is now the large used to be the regular size and the small 12oz is $5!!?? Huh? What? The most expensive OJ in Scottsdale for no reason other than they can. When I complained to the owner, he couldn't care less and told me that it's to offset the rising cost of oranges (yes, the same oranges that grow in the trees right outside) and that if I didn't like it, I could go somewhere else. Obviously I will never buy OJ from them again- I didn't need him to tell me that! It's not organic... why would anyone pay $5 for this?? NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because I'm still obsessed with this place! 

Since my last review I've tried a number of things on the menu, and I really love their fish tacos and the Tunisian tuna sandwich! We order lunch from milk+honey all the time because we just love how fresh and flavorful the food is."}
{"text":"The food and service are fabulous. We ordered the pizza and the Isreali plate. So amazing. The pizza was the right thickness - not too thick not too thin and had great flavor. The Isreali plate had wonderful humus, pita, pickles, tahini, chopped salad and falafel. The portions are generous and the food is a winner. By the way the chocolate mousse was out of this world. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"FRESH TASTY AND SOOOOOO MANY GOOD OPTIONS!  We ordered the following : 
Tunisian tuna 
Greek salad 
Kale tacos 
Enchilada 
Nicoise salad 
Minestrone soup 
Cheese, potato, and spinach burekas

Ended with meal with some  expressos :) 
Would come back anytime !!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, fantastic food- great selection!! Great people!! My favorite is the taquitos and Mexican food is general,  great wraps and if you want challah/ - sweet like honey,  Kosher! Kosher! Kosher!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Got a take out Israeli platter which had all my faves: hummus, falafel, israeli salad, pickles and a pita. I got home enjoyed it sooo much yummmmm. It even came w a little container of tahini sauce. I will def be going back again soon"}
{"text":"Loved it. I believe today was the first day he opened and I can already tell from my first meal with them that this place will be a hit.

I had the classic Hummus, Falafel, and Pita combo and it was perfect. The pita was awesome and fresh. They added Israeli salad and Israeli pickles to the plate and it made the appetizer feel like a full meal.

Go and try this plate out! You're going to be happy you did."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for kosher food. Highly recommend and I love the ambience - the greenery surrounding the restaurant is a good vibe, and the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"I just came to Milk and Honey for the third time this week. The quality of the food is unlike any other restaurant in Arizona. Many restaurants try to serve farm fresh food, Milk and Honey actually does. The chipotle salmon wrap is hands down the best wrap I've ever had.
This is a new restaurant and I would to be surprised if we see more locations. Considering how good the ingredients and service is, I will be back often. 
Here's a tip for newbies. When you enter the JCC, go to the right once you are inside."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. La nourriture est fraîche et excellente. Le
Service et l'ambiance sont très agréables. 
Mon mari et moi avons adoré, nous reviendrons. 
Bon continuation."}
