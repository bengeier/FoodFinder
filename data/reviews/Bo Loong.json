{"text":"Bo Loong has to be one of the best joints in the Chinatown / Asian restaurant district. They primarily cater to the local ethnic community so you'll find a far greater variety per the menu than most cookie-cutter Americanized Chinese dives that purvey a greatly watered-down fare to ignorant Americans who haven't a clue as to what great Chinese cuisine tastes like. If you've never experienced dim sum then this is the place to dive in and enjoy all the little dishes to your heart's content. The only negative about this place is the location. I'd be a little leery visiting after dark as this isn't the best neighborhood. If you want to experience great Chinese cuisine and don't want to travel to a larger city to experience it, then this place is a must for you."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious, fish is very fresh. Not too much soy sauce and other ingredients, keep the real taste of the food. It is real Chinese style cuisine. They also offer free soup and beancurd jelly."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. My order was finished quickly. The vegetable fried rice is delicious. I also ordered the Chicken with Broccoli. It was literally boiled chicken with steamed broccoli and carrots. No sauce whatsoever. I think they may have used a little salt to season it and nothing else. It was extremely watery. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant!  I've lived in Cleveland all my life, and never new it even existed until late 2010.  The quality of their chinese food is the best I have ever had (compared to other mainly chinese restaurants). The service was o.k., but the food made up for it.  And the prices are very good, even for dinner time.  People said that the decor needed upgrading...I've seen much much worse.  The decor at this restaurant was actually pretty decent, and quite amusing.   As Arnold would say, I'll be back!

Edit:  I went there a week and a half ago for the 2nd time...at a more better hour for dinner where there are a lot more people, and cousin, service was a boomin!  I really like this place, and will do the 1/2 hr drive for my chinese food now!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant since the 90s.
Same owner, same old servers.

DIM SUM is really really good, better then Li Wah at E.30th ST in my opinion.

Price has went up in the past 5 years, but it was very reasonable. Even McDonald raises its price.

Recommended Dim Sum time is Weekend morning. DIM SUM is only served till 3pm. After that time, if you really really want, it will take them more then 30mins to cook them. Yes, it does take that long.

Service is not the best, but OK. Restroom is not dirty, it is just aged and old.

If you want to try the real Cantonese dim sum and food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Yes, you can get Dim Sum at Bo Loong. But this place is secretly known for it's late night Karaoke and menu. 

There are plenty of drink options, the food is typical chinese, and you can sing english and a variety of asian language songs til 4am. 

Gather up your friends, and come on down! This is a good place for a group."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good. I think you just have to know what you're ordering. My favorite is the walnut shrimp and mushroom Yee noodles. This place is family owned and definitely reminds me of Asian soul food. Great for drunk nights after the club. :)"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Bo loong for dim sum when I lived in Cleveland. I thought some of the options were so exotic and adventurous to try. I developed a life long love affair with turnip cakes, and eggplant with oyster sauce because of this place. I did always think it was a little crowded, and I don't remember going for any meal other than dim sum in the morning, but it definitely fills a niche in northern Ohio."}
{"text":"Great dim sum, haven't been here for anything else though. Make sure to go on a weekend around 11:30-12pm for dim sum (typical eating time for asians and dim sum service) because you will have many more choices.

Things to try: chicken feet, shumai, steamed pork buns, black bean spareribes, sweet egg custard tart to finish your meal

Make sure everything is fresh though, some of that stuff will sit around for hours..."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place on a Tuesday for lunch. It is right across from Siam Cafe where I had lunch a couple weeks prior. I'd heard/read about both these places and decided I just needed to see for myself. 

It was about noon, and raining heavily outside, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the place being pretty slow. I'd say there were about 8-9 tables with guests, and a few of those were single diners like myself. 

The service was prompt, even though the waitress was a little hard to understand. I tried some of the shrimp dim sum, and then had the sheschuan shrimp, which came with soup and green tea. I thought everything I had was very tasty, and the portions were a good size. excellent value, considering my entire meal was a little more than $9. will be back again to try more menu items.

I think this place gets a bit of a bad wrap compared to Siam cafe across the street, but I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because Siam Cafe has big windows on three sides and appears much brighter in comparison to Bo Loong, which is definitely darker on the insde, mainly becuase of the lack of windows.

I thought the food was authentic, delicious, and a great value. Best for you to see for yourself."}
{"text":"bo loong has always been our go-to place for dimsum.

what we had (11/18/12) 

shumai

i'm starting with the shumai, which to me is one of the best i've had anywhere.

texture and taste are what set it apart.

it's not mushy like other shumais, it has a certain snap to it that i like.

dip in soy sauce with some chili oil and we're good to go.

fantastic balanced taste.

i don't know how else to describe shumai, it's just good.

we always get at least 2 orders of this.

since we're in a group of 7 people for lunch, we got to have 5 orders.

(9.5 / 10)

Har Gaw

not sure how you can go wrong with har gaw.

not the best i've had, but i also don't know where i had the best har gaw.

it's pretty hard to mess this up.

here it's still very good.

shrimp also has the \"snap\" that i also wanted in the shumai.

maybe the wrap is a little thick compared to other har gaws, but it still works for 
me.

you gotta have har gaw anyway when having dim sum, and it's no exception here.

(8 / 10)

pork, shrimp, and chive dumpling

ok, so this is pretty average.

not too good, but not bad either.

one of those \"we've got to have some variety since there's so many choices\" type of thing.

it's like an elongated shumai with chives, but it's still not shumai.

i know it's hard to skip on taking on other stuff when you have a cart filled with different dimsums.

so this is one of those fillers.

still not bad though, and you can't go wrong with the combination.

but nothing memorable.

(6 / 10).

Chiu Chow Pork

we were told that this is still chiu chow pork, though the wrapping is different from 
traditional chiu chow porks.

the traditional ones have a thicker wrap, similar to that of har gow.

this one is similar to the shrimp, pork, and chive dimsum, it retains the chives 
and pork, but also has peanuts on it.

nothing fancy, not bad, not good.

average.

(5 / 10). 

pan fried char siu bao

we had this for the first time.

it's char siu bao, which is pan fried.

really, really good.

char siu bao is char siu bao anyway.

with that soft, bready texture of the bun with savory pork filing.

but the pan fried aspect of this dish is what took it a notch higher.

the crisp texture of two sides of the bun made it even better.

to me this is a better version of the traditional char siu bao.

this also became a favorite at our table.

(9.5 / 10).

Shrimp Cheong Fun

like the har gaws, i don't think you can screw up with shrimp cheong funs.

unless you overcook the shrimp, make it mushy, and take out the snap.

or mess up with the noodle, and maybe overcook it also.

the sweetened soy sauce here is fairly consistent as it is everywhere.

this one is good, though once again doesn't wow.

that said always have this if available.

(8 /10). 

Steamed Octopus

octopus was perfectly cooked.

not my favorite type of preparation, but we saw it there, so we ordered it.
firm but not tough, also a nice break from all the pork and starch around.

(6.5 / 10). 

Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce

this is another staple of dimsum places.

to me the more bones there are, the more flavor.

some others probably prefer the meatier parts, thinking there's more quantity in the order.

but these ones, probably chopped in the rib area, work well.

very flavorful and tender.

(7 / 10).

steamed fish with black bean sauce

the fish was tender, blends well with the sauce.

highlight was the fish, and the sauce was right enough not to overpower the fish.

tilapia is what they used here. and like the octopus, was a good break from all the pork stuff.

we also always order this when available, they do this well over here.

(7.5 / 10). 

tofu skins with pork

this one is actually good.

the picture doesn't admittedly, but that was the only one of its kind left on the cart.

think of it as a deconstructed shumai with tofu skins.

first time we ordered this, as we always have the one with mushrooms, which will be described below.

but this was very good. the picture doesn't do it justice, but this is real good.

(8.5 / 10). 

we always had a take that the best dimsum places are not the nicest.

we even think it's the opposite - the nicer the place and ambiance, the worse or more accurately, the less authentic the dimsum is.

li wah may be a nicer place, but i think the dim sum there is very bland.

it's very clean though, and a lot of office workers eat there, which could also be an indication of how they tailor their food.

bo loong though is always packed on saturday and sunday lunch, filled with mostly asian families as they carry on what is the equivalent of a weekend brunch.
 
we enjoy the food and comfort of eating at bo loong.

we go there early, around 1130 to 12 to get some parking, sit, i stand when the dimsum cart arrives, pick dimsums, and eat.

best place in cleveland for dimsum.

{"text":"Good for dim sum, bad for almost everything else. 

I worked around the corner for this place and ate almost everything on the lunch menu in hopes that I could finally get that one good meal. It never happened. 

If you want dim sum, tell them. They will come."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better.  A year ago I would have given the place three stars for the food, but that was before I dined here in December of 2009.  The food was cold and some of the items were undercooked.  It was the first time where we were reluctant to order more food even though we weren't really full.  Since the dim sum items were no longer a palatable option, we ordered some noodles and fried rice.  Thankfully, those items were more edible, although still only mediocre.  If only C&Y were still around..."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I had ordered a takeout meal and it was pretty good.  So, last week, I had friends with me and we were very hungry, so I suggested this place to dine in.

Big mistake!  As soon as we walked in, all we smelled was a strong fishy smell.  As the waitress took us to our seats, we saw were that putrid smell was coming from....several absolutely filthy fish tanks on the wall.  They were overgrown with algae and some had dead fish floating in the water.

Why did we stay? I have no idea.  And the food was so-so.
Will not be visiting or suggesting this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing little place, too many Americanized Chinese dishes
like sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, lo mein etc.

 If you want to eat better Chinese food with fresh ingredients 
for better price with a friendly brighter atmosphere and cleaner
restaurant just look across the street. 

 Siam Cafe has a much better menu and you're more likely to 
find real authentic Chinese food (excluding the dumplings which
Bo Loong has better ones) everything at Siam Cafe is just better."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese Food Ever!!!

Tried Bo Loong for take out and it was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Everything was greasy and had a heavy thick greasy taste. The dumplings were horrible, cutting into one and grease just poured from it. 
I also tried the sweet and sour chicken, how could that get messed up right? Needless to say that was over greasly, and at the same time dry and over cooked. We also got the shrimp fried noodles, the sauce had an over powering fish taste, overly salty, not enjoyable at all. The eggroll was also very greasy. 

We could not get over the over powering taste of grease, old greasy taste at that, to really know what we were eating and to enjoy it. A complete disappointment and waste of money. Would not ever order again or have anyone else that I liked order from them."}
{"text":"Big menu, wide variety of food. The Lobster dish is good, some of the other dishes are miss and hit. Gotta try for yourself!"}
{"text":"I used to like Bo Loong quite a bit. I haven't there much recently, though, because there are just so many great restaurants in Asia Town that divide my attention. I recently went to Bo Loong because I was craving really good classic Chinese food. What an utter disappointment. The egg rolls were pretty good and the wonton soup was okay, but the rest of the meal tasted like it came straight out of a can! The chicken clearly wasn't fresh, the vegetables were an embarrassment, and the sauce was tasteless. My guess is that they're trying to cut costs because of dwindling business, but they are never going to compete with the stellar Siam Cafe, #1 Pho, Superior Pho, Seoul Hot Pot, etc., etc., etc., at this rate. I won't be making the mistake of going back to Bo Loong."}
{"text":"Dim sum and then some.

After Tom's Seafood closed (the most unlikely place for dim sum in Cleveland), Bo Loong took the top spot.

Dozens of steaming carts rolling around to tempt you with yummy morsels.  Careful those, gai lan (the popular green veg) is tough to get, cuz it goes fast!

Better get there before noon, though, otherwise you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"Best pot stickers in the world!!!! Haven't tried much else but I don't feel that I need to. I love Boo Long and that's that"}
{"text":"My family loves visiting here. My kids love the dim sum and so do we. Sure, it's not the fanciest place, but it's authentic, right down to the staff who barely speaks English. You can't beat the prices for the quality of food. We like it."}
{"text":"I suppose that to many, Chinese food is like that pizza/sex saying that \"even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.\" I think that's how i feel about Chinese food.

Bo Loong completely and utterly FAILED at the wonton soup. Zero taste. Forgettable wontons. Too many scallions ... Clear broth? WTF?!

Everything else, though, fell somewhere between \"passable\" and \"pretty good\" except the pork egg roll, which was excellent. I'll give a separate star rating to each item I tried because ... Well, because I feel like it.

Wonton soup: *
shumai: ****
steamed pork buns: ** (what a disappointment! There was too much bun and not enough pork, and way too much fatty crap in there. I don't mean that the pork was fatty, i mean it was simply pork fat and not enough actual meat.)
Pork egg roll: *****
fried dumplings: ** (weirdest dumplings ever ...)
Chicken and broccoli: ***

Will I order again? Hmmmm...probably not. You f@ck with my wonton soup, you f@ck with me, son!"}
{"text":"Saturday night karaoke. 'nuff said. Imagine the opulence."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were rolling through Cleveland en rt to Chi and did a search for late night dining. Everyone seemed to claim this grub was great - so we decided to give it a go. On the way back to NY I think we will stop by East 4th instead for some Mexican fare.

We rolled in here around 1 AM or so - they're open till 3 AM - and I had hopes of ordering loads of the supposedly great dim sum. I was informed it took 20 minutes to make and hesitantly offered to show me a menu. I just said nevermind and ordered the Szeschuan mixed  plate (shrimp, scallops, pork) which is supposed to be very spicy. I also had the wonton soup - which  was pretty good and I enjoyed it. The main course however was just really tremendously oily and everything soaked up the not at all spicy sauce. Everything, that is, save for the scallop - which was extraordinarily fishy tasting!  Mleh.
My friend ordered the pork pot stickers which came with a good sauce but were nothing special.  He also had the Moo Goo Gai Pan which I tasted and lamented the blandness of what can so easily be a great dish. This too was coated in sauce that disallowed the boiled vegetables their day in the spotlight.
Boo to you Bo Loong.
Maybe I should have been adamant about the dim sum. Shrugs.  For late night dining - look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been there once with friends. The menu there is good. I like their stir fried dishes."}
{"text":"One of the longest standing asian restaurants in the Cleveland area.  Parking is a bit tight and consumer base is lower than during it's hay-day.  The food is still good and portions are generous.  I rotate between here and Siam across the street for take-out whenever I'm in town.  The layout of the restaurant hasn't changed much, though I heard ownership has.  I would give this place a 4 star review if not for the below average waiting staff and the long wait times for your take-out order.  I would call an order in 15-20 mins prior to arrival and STILL have to wait another 15 mins by the time I got there to get my food?  I think many times they do not cook my order until they see me walk in.  They probably prioritize the sit-ins, which is understandable, and I don't mind waiting another 5 or so mins if they're busy but another 15 or so is frustrating and annoying.  Again, I'll still come there for food but I really hope they can be better with their time and respect mine."}
{"text":"We went for dimsum once because we heard good things about this place. The place was moderately busy and there were many dimsum carts rolling. The staff's English leaves something to be desired as it was difficult to communicate. Some of the dishes, which I knew were supposed to be hot, were cold and dry. If you go early, you may have a better dimsum experience, but otherwise, it was very mediocre."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP how disappointing! I was a long time regular of Bo Loong many years ago and when it came time to make Easter dinner plans for 12 folks I thought this would be the perfect place. Well, now I have to be held accountable for dragging my family and kin to a terrible and poorly served meal.

I don't know what much to say besides that the service was unfriendly and inattentive, the food ranged from uninteresting to inedible, and everyone's meals were brought out at different times which sucked. My main squeeze got a beef dish which was gristley and chewy, I chose a duck dish which was soggy, mostly skin and fat, and had so much cartilage and bone fragments throughout that I gave up on trying to eat. No one finished their meals, I am rather embarrassed having made this suggestion.

Also, we never got a drink menu of any kind, and we had to ask for water twice. Not a single person working there so much as greeted us even fake warmly, or smiled, or otherwise made us feel welcome there for a meal. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because I remembered the late nights I used to spend there and how sweet they were, and how the cocktails ruled and the kareoke was awesome. But today was a total suck."}
{"text":"This will all ways be my family's favorite Sunday dim sum spot. Its my family has been going here for over 15yrs. I love the staff. Being a African American family they have always treated us well and respected our knowledge of traditional asian culture and didn't try to dummy is down on some fried rice and chicken wings, pepper steak!  Lol"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had in a long time, so I didn't stay long. The two items off their dim sum menu, that I did try, both had an overwhelming fish taste and an oatmeal consistency."}
{"text":"one of the best dim sum houses in Cleveland. the selection is larger on the weekends, but quite acceptable on weekdays. the staff during dim sum hours is friendly and helpful and service is good. unfortunately, I cannot say the same for dinner as simple dishes were not prepared properly and the waiter was more than rude, though her did remove the questionable item from the tab. the staff here are mostly teochew Chinese though they can speak Mandarin and Cantonese."}
{"text":"Bo Loong is not nearly as good as Siam across the street, but its still pretty good.  Food is cheap.  They have a lot of tasty dishes, but you have to order the right things.  The good thing about this place is that its open late on weekends.  My friends would always come here when we had midnight cravings."}
{"text":"I only go there for family events. So last night. I was awful. No taste to any of the dishes. Needed hot and soy sauce for everything. Besides that the interior looks more and more outdated and gross (I've posted some pictures). Staff is typical unfriendly and unmotivated. 2nd star is for the dim-sum which is usually decent."}
{"text":"We went back again considering the first time around being so good. Not so much this time. My food was not hot when it came out and one friend ordered shrimp with pea pods. It came out chicken instead. She sent it back and when the shrimp and pea pods came out MOST of the chicken had been removed and shrimp had been added.  We were all disappointed. Also, if they would clean all those tanks that are randomly placed around the restaurant it might smell better. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The best part is that it is open untill 2:45am on the weekends.  I tell ya what there is nothing better than eating here after a long night of concerts at the Beachland Ballroom!
Heres the Skinny:
1. Food-Fast and Delicious
2. Quantity- Plentiful and more than you can eat
3. DIM SUM- Yup its available but you have to order 3 at a time for $9.99 and its worth every penny.
4. Price- Very cheap.  I have never spent more than $30 for two people to eat like savages.
5. Parking- Plenty of parking in the lot.
6. Menu- More selections than you can imagine.  
RECAP:  This place is fantastic.  The servers are friendly, helpful and very good.  I have never taken anyone here that was dissapointed.  This place is tops on my list and I suggest you go sooner than later."}
{"text":"Lots of veg options and the wait staff was friendly but that's about all I can recommend. The food was extremely oily for my taste, and also pretty flavorless. The rice tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. The veg egg rolls were conpletely stuffed wirh the blandest cabbage possible.  The tofu and vegetables was swimming in brown sauce. The moo shu vegetables were tasteless.

Not the worst Chinese but also not worth a return visit.

PS -- The parking lot in the front is very small and hard to navigate."}
{"text":"Just a quickie update.  They no longer serve alcohol not even beer or wine if that factors in to your decision."}
{"text":"I had dim sum for lunch with a friend at Bo Loong on 11-13-16.  The little shrimp dumplings were the best of the lot.  The tea is good, plentiful and fresh.  The pot stickers were generously filled and hot and crispy on the outside.  I was unable to identify what filling was in the remaining dim sum that I ordered, but all were tasty except for the eggplant with shrimp (which was not great as eggplant slabs were way too big).  By mistake I ordered what I think was meant to be a dessert dim sum as part of my lunch; however, it, too, was quite good.  Service was prompt.  The place was jumping when we arrived around 11:15am, and although crowded, the noise level is moderate to low--a pleasant change.  The restroom was not filthy as someone else described it; rather, it was very old and in need of a rehab, but it was as clean as a 40+ year old bathroom could be.  There is enough off street parking but it is a tight fit.  The bill for two of us for 7 different dim sum was under $25, which was plenty for an ample lunch and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We ordered a meal to-go from here last Sunday and it was one of the worst meals we have ever had. The Won Ton soup tasted like hot water with unseasoned noodles. Sweet and Sour chicken was dry and hard. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Killer dim sum!!!! Everyday until 3pm. Food is worth the price and food is also exquisite. Best dim sum we have had since we left San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"I don't like to be a complainer,but I'm extremely disappointed about this place.

The chicken feet looks small and dirty. We also ordered the boiled chicken with garlic sauce on the side. The chicken smells so fishy,also there's a lot of chicken feathers on the surface,the black spots looks so disgusting. The salt and pepper eggplant was flavorless. The service wasn't good, waitress didn't even give us small bowls for sharing the rice. 

When check out at the register,I would like to tell the \"manager\" Their chicken wasn't good at all,but they keep  arguing with me that's because I chose the wrong dish,their fried chicken is better! ARE YOU SERIOUSLY? It means I got the bad dish is because I didn't order the fried chicken? They didn't feel sorry for their bad food. This is not the attitude.

Also,all the containers that leave on the table were COVERED WITH DIRT! Can't imagine how many years they haven't clean it. 

Waste money for the meal,worst customer service. Never come back."}
{"text":"Staff very rude. Closed at 2 we got there at 1145. Staff not friendly nor welcoming. Food terrible.  Rice hard and egg rolls old.  My bf had pork which he stated tasted terrible.  Flavorless ! Never again"}
{"text":"I find it so amusing that no one knows when this place is open until. Yelp says one thing, Google says another, they change every few months. Yet I have never gone here and they have not been open. There's the middle age Asian men who come here at 1 am for a good meal. Then the drunk kids who come in at 2am after bars close. The best food for any occasion!"}
{"text":"A group of us met at Bo Loong today for a reunion and lunch. The atmosphere was nice and the food was delicious.  I am usually disappointed when you go out to pay good money for dinner and you get your food and it is just warm. The food came to the table nice and hot. The hot and sour soup was soooo good and the Kung pro was nice and spicy. We will go back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my 24 year \"homecoming\" with Bo Loong. 
They got the tea correct when I requested Pu Li, instead of the default jasmine. 
Then the bad news, only one cart, for the entire restaurant, I'm not even sure if the steamers were on...
The single standout was the sticky rice covered in lotus leaf. 
In the menu, one is reminded that the cover is not edible. 
I guess some poor soul ate it, making that story legendary in the kitchen. 
Make sure you get the Pu Li tea, its the perfect pairing with dim sum, specially if the dim sum is greasy."}
{"text":"It's rare for my party of five to order five dishes and to like every single entree. Faced with a far-reaching menu, we turned to our server for recommendations. Each dish was unique in its own ways with no overlap in flavors -- the sign of a talented Cantonese chef. The highlight, however, was the Vietnamese Beef Ding that our server had strongly suggested. The dish comprised of simple cubes of beef with a blend of spices that sparked my taste buds. 

Sadly, the positives to Bo Loong end at the cooking. Service was iffy at best. Aside from some guidance at the start of our meal from our server, our teapot with the askew lid went ignored until the end of our meal -- when the owner himself made note of that to one of the three servers handling the dining area. But for the deliciousness that Bo Loong shells out, I'll happily overlook the service."}

My 3 friends didn't like their meals and service wasn't good even though we were only table. The place is a little divey in retrospect ."}

{"text":"The waiters knows what I like when I come here midnight on Fridays: a Qing Tao beer and a plate beef noodles, although my crew deviated from that last weekend and ended up devouring an excellent roast duck instead.  They'll lock the doors and let you eat and drink until 3.

But it's not just the food and drink that bring people here on Friday nights - it's the karaoke.  

Oh, the karaoke! 

Everyone's usually pretty tolerant of the not-so-silken croonings of me and my party, and the song selection is fabulous in that it often makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Whoever thought that you could sing Radiohead's \"Idiotheque\", or \"2+2=5\", Pantera's \"Fucking Hostile\", or Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\"?  There are also a couple songs on the menu by some character named Steffen Wolf (someone seems to have thought that Steppenwolf is a typo).  All music is inexplicably accompanied on the video screen by clips from sad Korean movies, or scenes from Hawaiian paradise.

The atmosphere is friendly, although things have the potential to get a little ugly when some drunken fool (or group of fools) attempts \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".  Otherwise, please come join me up on the stage as I rock out to \"Eye of the Tiger\", pay homage to the 80's with \"Like a Prayer\", or get a little sentimental with \"More Than Words\".  If I have extra $3.50 in my pocket, I'll even buy you a Qing Tao."}

It's not the best I've had in the neighborhood (like I'm even qualified to make that statement), but it's not the worst either!  I would recommend the Curry Chicken or the Schezwan Chicken.  YUM YUM Shout Outs to both!"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill! I haven't eaten here in about 2 years and decided to order a few things through delivermefood. The shrimp egg rolls were okay as well as the pork egg rolls. Nothin special mind you. I also ordered General Chicken and got big tough stringy pieces of chicken. The Roast Pork and Braised Tofu was flavorful but the pork was full of fat and gristle. I would say half of it was inedible and there wasn't much of it there. The pork fried rice was bland and had even more gristle and fat than the other dish. I will never be ordering from them again. So disappointed in the LOW QUALITY of their food. I'll stick with Peking in Lakewood. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow, I really used to enjoy this place, especially late night.  Well 2 bad later night experiences have knocked my opinion of this once late night staple way down. It appears if you are not Chinese or order some heavily battered shit you are pretty much getting bottom of the barrel Americanized take out  quality caliber crap. Man, I have been dinning here for 18+ years! This feels like a bad break up! Not much more to say : ( Well I scheduled a party here in a few weeks, I guess that is going to be canceled!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it deserves the four stars I'm giving it, but I have a bit of an affinity for this place. I've been here for dim sum a few times, and while Li Wah is the more popular option, Bo Loong definitely holds their own.

They carry all your standard dim sum options, and they taste great as well. I think I like the siumai here more than Li Wah even. They are plumpier and juicier. If they get busy, expect the cart ladies to migrate towards the Chinese customers, but really all you have to do is stare them down and wave them over when eye contact is made, and they'll remember you exist. 

I guess what won me over about this place is their late night dining. After a night out with friends, if you're craving that drunk, greasy, probably not very healthy food at 2:30 in the morning, Bo Loong has you covered. People come in here stumbling, loud, obnoxious, and I have witnessed projectile vomiting, but their late night staff has always been very accomodating and friendly. Very cool guys. Portions are huge. Food comes out FAST and tastes great, sober or not. Must-haves are their King Fried Rice, Steak Kew (aka Bo Luc Lac), Walnut Mayo Shrimp, Deep Fried Tofu w/ Shrimp, and Honey Sesame Chicken."}
{"text":"I basically joined Yelp! Just to review Boo Long. (I call it Boo-Long, not Bo-Loong so bear with my purposeful spelling errors.) I have such mixed feelings about it!

My relationship with Boo Long is complicated. I've been a customer for at least 2 years, but always after 2am, as they are open until 3am to serve your drunken, greasy Chinese food needs. For this purpose, they are amazing. If you're running a little late, they'll stay open until about 3:15 just so you can soak up the quart of vodka in your stomach with some fried rice. Much appreciated!

But then I actually went inside last week to have dinner. It was a Saturday night, but it was definitely not crowded. There were probably 4 tables filled- maybe 12 customers total. The wait staff was pokey at best and quite rude at their worst. My date and I were eating with another couple and the couple we were with got their food at least 15 minutes before we did, though we all ordered at the same time. Our pal's eggroll order was completely forgotten, and once we received our food, it was pretty disgusting.

This is coming from someone who expected sub-par, greasy Chinese. My lo mein was flavorless, my tempura vegetables too fried to even consume, and my date, who basically has soup running through their veins instead of blood, was subject to the grossest, booger-stew-lookin' hot and sour soup of all time.

The one plus? There was a wedding reception or some type of function going on in the partitioned off room, and they were playing 90's hip-hop jams that kept a smile on my face.

In summary, unless Siam Cafe across the street is closed or you are really freaking drunk, do not venture into Boo Long. There is a time and a place for everything, ya know?"}
{"text":"This was the worst dim sum experience I have ever had. We got a couple of things off a cart that happened to be near our table when we were seated. After that, we waited for 30 - 45 minutes...watching people come in after us and having the carts rush over. All the new guests being served were Chinese. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. But after waiting that long and not having any carts stop by (and a person who I thought was a manager brushing us off), we paid our balance and left. 

As we were paying the bill, a lady (I am guessing she is the owner) asked us if everything was okay. Since I was too livid to talk, my friend politely stated we didn't get much food. The lady said we should have told her and she would have gotten all the carts to our table immediately. Oh, I didn't realize it was my job to guarantee I got food at a restaurant. My bad."}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday Friday January 19 2018.  The inside is utterly gross.  Place is filled with gross dated tanks containing fish and other sea food.  Tanks were so dirty!  You can automatically smell them when you are first seated. Ordered a lemonade that  came out as clear as water itself.  Had no taste what so ever. The food left a lot to be desired. Got my nephew the beef with vegetables.  He spent the bulk of the time wrestling with the meat because it was so tough.  Our waiter was very rude as well. My friend mentioned to her that she didn't like the taste of the dish she had, and would like for it to be replaced. The waiter proceeded to tell my friend \"it's not my fault you ordered it, that's what you decided on. Not my problem.\". Will never come here again.  Left queasy and grossed out over this place.  Needs an update."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time. Brought my employees here too,

But the place is just totally run down now. Bathrooms are ( and have always been) dirty, but worse than usual.

But the food got worse.  rewarmed  duck, Dim Sum is slow and repetitive. Dim sum servers not polite, and can't speak English at all.

Salt baked squid/shrimp is still excellent.

Menu prices jumped up at least 20%, with no improvement in decor or food.

Later Bo Loong - go to Siam directly  across the street...excellent food

BUT - great late night karaoke food on weekends"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food ever. I ordered the empress chicken with fried rice and egg roll from the lunch menu. cost me $9 for lunch menu! The food was inedible. The cabbage in the egg roll had a funky taste and was disgusting. The chicken was salty, flavorless and awful. The fried rice was even disgusting. It was called fried rice, but it only contained a tan colored rice. No egg, bean sprouts, or green onion. Just rice. I was later told by  an employee that the fried rice on the combination menu doesn't include those ingredients. Well, why are u calling it fried rice?? Good news is, they had no problem returning my money. I gave them that crap back! Siam across the street is wayyyyyyy better!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum at the Bo Loong Restaurant reminds me of growing up in Hong Kong. Going to dim sum over there was done multiple times a week!  Bo Loong is always excellent and always authentic from the friendliness of the ladies pushing the carts of dim sum around to the freshness of the food."}
{"text":"FAIL.
Baked Salted Fish? Was...fried. No spice at all.
Ma Pao Tofu? Tasteless. (really? is this their version of spicy?)
Cashew Chicken? Basically was a container of oily onions.

Only saving grace? 
SHARK'S FIN DUMPLING & Szechwan Eggplant.

Will never order lunch from there again.

Tasteless. Grease. Boring.

They also forgot to include chop sticks. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Decent dim sum restaurant, all things said. The establishment has all the essentials of a good dim sum restaurant, like har gow, siu mai, spring rolls, as well as some unique stuff like their steamed fish with black bean and tofu. The food is not of mind blowing quality, but it's solid dim sum and will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Here is where you can get \"value\" dim sum.

By \"value,\" I mean both the food quality and selection are much worse here than at Li Wah, but this restaurant is also significantly cheaper.  Really though, I would spend the extra money and go to Li Wah.  Or better yet, get dim sum in another city.

I mean, seriously, if you see five times as many cars in the parking lot for Siam Cafe across the street, it doesn't tell you something about this place?"}
{"text":"Came here on the way back from vacation. Been here many times growing up and food is good quality. Fried flounder, pan fried seafood noodle and gently fried chicken are good dinner options here. They also have tender pork chop cutlets in sweet and sour and A1 sauce mix. Entrees extend beyond typical fast food Chinese meals. The atmosphere isn't high grade but nice for a small family & friends gatherings, good for kids and a down to earth setting."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Arrived on Sunday around 11am for dim sum, and the place was dead... Like two other small tables. They only had a few carts going around, and a smaller selection than what Li Wah would be pushing. There also did not appear to be a dim sum menu, which makes things difficult for patrons who have never had dim sum or do not speak Canto/Mando. By noon, the place was filling but there was no wait line to be seated. 

Usually I find dim sum to be on the greasier side, but Bo Loong was on point! No excess grease except for maybe on the salt baked squid. My favorite was probably the dou miao, which is a green leafy veggie sauteed with garlic, or the har gaw, which is a shrimp type of dumpling."}
{"text":"Review Date: 03/26/2009

    The food is for Americans and they are so stuck in their ways that it is all still served with MSG. I had the cashew chicken and my wife had noodles stir fried with chicken. It was all very bland. The egg roll was heavy and the only thing it had in it was cabbage. This might be the best in Cleveland, I wouldn't know I am not from here. My frame of reference compares this restaurant with the hundred I have eaten at from Chicago to NY to FL to Dallas and inbetween. Use lots of soy and chili oil and it passes for an ok meal but I would skip the whole thing, MSG is really bad."}
{"text":"Open late...hilarious karaoke (when it works).  But when it does....you won't be able to stop laughing at the videos that are played along with the music!!!
Dim-sum...I advise weekend only, go early and take an Asian person with you if you want to actually be served.  I speak from experience, having frequented the establishment with my (now ex) Filipino husband.
Rest of the menu....blah.  
New Wong's (now called wonton BBQ or something) will meet all your delicious Chinese food needs, and is more authentic!"}
{"text":"one star! the food was gross. the chicken was chewy and inedible. the people at the table next to me were overheard complaining of their unsatisfactory meals. otherwise the place was empty. yet this restaurant regularly receives glowing reviews in local publications. why? is someone friends with journalists or what? the food is awful and the location is less than safe. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"One of a great Dim Sum place. The level of customer is toward more of local old style Chinese. Authentic,  tasty,  hearty!  Love love love!"}
{"text":"Let me just start this review with: I'm from Houston. Houston has a great Chinatown, and I have extremely high expectations for dimsum. I came here on a Sunday to show a friend what dimsum was so I ordered the common dishes: har gow (shrimp dumpling), siumai (pork dumpling), turnip cake, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, baked pork buns, har cheung (shrimp noodle rolls). He loved everything. I was extremely disappointed with service and food quality. They never asked us what we wanted to drink. None of the dishes tasted fresh/barely warm. I found chicken bones in the sticky rice; luckily, I didn't bite down too hard. Tons of fat in the baked pork buns. I won't be returning for dimsum."}
{"text":"This place was really good. We came here for a quick holiday lunch for our department. We started with an order of potstickers and shrimp dumplings. The pot stickers are huge! All combos come with wonton soup and an egg roll which is really nice as well. The egg foo young was really good but my only complaint was that I asked for the gravy on the side but it still came with it drenched on top. Not a big deal as it seems to be common to have it put on. Again, the only complaint was that a couple of orders were forgotten or wrong and the place wasn't overly busy. The waitress seemed to kind of push us through our orders. All were friendly and I would definitely like to come back."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and efficient, but my food was a little mediocre. I heard the place across the street is better."}
{"text":"I hate that I have to write this. Earlier this evening- I had a choice between Mexican and Chinese- a dear friend sent me down the China route and I ordered Bo Loongs. First timer. Utter fail. Like- the food is in the trash.
The noodles were... just.. wow. Can't even discuss. Pot stickers as well... yikes.
I will not continue because I think I need to take the trash to the dumpster.
As for my dear friend... she's on food decision probation. JS."}
{"text":"I got take away and was really disappointed. The flavor was missing from my food, which was really odd since I thought General Tso's Chicken is usually a spicy dish. It wasn't spicy. It wasn't sweet. It really didn't taste like much. Some of the chicken was not edible. Thrown in with all the chicken were a few pieces of broccoli drowned and therefore saturated in the chicken's no doubt sugar laden sauce. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed!  Not even taking into account that they're one of the few places in town that offers Dim Sum...

Ordered the Duck and Vegies as well as the Beef Chow Mein.  We went on Chinese New Year so I also ordered several potstickers and dumplings.  I guess my only complaint is that the dumplings were fried, but hey, they were still delicious!

Everything I had was flavorful, chock full of bok choy, meat, sprouts, all the good stuff!  Our service was also spot on.  Honestly, couldn't ask for more!  

I've also ordered catering from them, several times actually.  Every time it's been authentic (and I feel like I can say that because I work with several Cantonese coworkers and students), well sized for the price, delivered on time., and all that good stuff.  

In fact, earlier in the day I'd had some of their dumplings catered.  These weren't fried (not sure if I just didn't see them on the menu or if they were a special catering offering for the day)., but they were amazing!  

Overall, a big fan!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from this place, and it was not so good. I ordered baked bbq pork buns (which were terrible, all bun, no meat, and what little meat was in there was inedible). Beef in wide noodles (which was also gross, took one bite and didn't eat the rest). And the beef vegetable lunch special. This was ok, plenty of food, decent egg roll and fried rice, but it was completely flavorless. I wanted to like this place, but given all the better alternatives in that same area of town, I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Dim sum!!! Granted that they are only a few places you can go for dimsum in Cleveland, but this is where I go if I crave it. I've actually been coming here all my life, and far as I can remember. For dimsum, dinner, parties everything. The decor hasn't really changed much at all, but at least the food is still good and the service too.

The place isn't new at all, everything is pretty well used here, but still okay for usage. Big restaurant though, hardly ever have to wait. Parking is okay, sometimes it gets a little tight if you're parking in the area near the entrance.

The food itself though is great. Dim sum is good here, lotsa service and you can special order things. The cart ladies will order it for you and you don't need to flag down a waitress. They have all the usual items, nothing too unusual, but usually those things aren't that great anyways. Dinner here has always been good (but dimsum is better so I don't come often for dinner), and late night meals too. They open late and at night they have karaoke for anyone who wishes to go up there. Basically, I don't recall much that I haven't liked foodwise. I'm a piggy. Hehe.

Service has always been great, with my parents and without. So they are okay with English and Chinese all the same. Hehe, so everyone will be fine coming here. Of course, if you know some Chinese its helpful, but you can always look at each dish before deciding anyhow.

This is still my place to go when I'm back in my hometown! Hehe, yes I may be biased, but oh well. I know what food I like and I know I can find some here!"}
