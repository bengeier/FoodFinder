{"text":"Went there for the very first time and it was awesome!!!  The food was delicious with individual sauces that are to DIE for!!  The owners, a very nice couple, were easy to talk to and super friendly and accommodating!!!  Also, THE BEST fresh brewed ice tea - not too many places in Wisconsin can make decent ice tea!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mike was wonderful! He made the experience great! The food was good as well! We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Friendly staff every time. I'd recommend the ribs, chicken and pulled pork so far. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a mom and pop place that I hope gets the support from the community it deserves. It is decorated with a Western theme with barn siding and horseshoes. There are cute checked tablecloths on each table. You can tell the people that own it are extremely hard working and pay attention to detail. When you walk in you immediately smell the delicious smoked meats. I tried several including the chicken, pork and brisket. Each were exceptionally prepared. Each side was also prepared perfectly. The smoked baked beans and macaroni and cheese were my favorites. The cornbread was fresh and moist. The best I have ever had. Even better that what I make at home.  The owner came out to ask how everyone's meal was. These folks are running an exceptional place with quality food and very pleasant atmosphere. They have a darling ice cream parlor. There is a gorgeous patio with large old evergreens. I have not eaten out there but have seen people under the umbrellas dining. I encourage you to give this A plus restaurant your business."}
{"text":"We stopped for ice cream.  It was very good.  But whomever told them how to measure a scoop was slightly off.  Very small portion.   I'd pass next time. It's not worth it for the money."}
{"text":"These guys are a great asset to the Oregon community. They are friendly and are a family run business who have been doing BBQ for I believe over 20 years. My favorite thing there are the ribs and their green beans. I also like that the owners come to check on you and make sure you are happy with the meal. We've been going there since they first opened up and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Great smoked pork and brisket! We had no issues with the ice cream serving. Don't go here expecting fine dining."}
{"text":"Stopped in halfway through a long bike ride for some ice cream. 24 flavors to choose from, and all the samples were delicious. Mike (ice cream scooper) was fantastic and raved about both the ice cream, the mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Cone was delicious. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We tried the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($5.95) with onion rings ($2.50) and BBQ Brisket Loaded Fries appetizer ($9.95).   I had called around 10:30 am to place the order, originally having my heart set on their brisket sandwich. However, the woman on the phone told me they only had \"chunks of the brisket, not the slices\" and therefore unable to fulfill my request.  When you first walk in, you will be greeter with the lively colors of the ice cream parlor half of the business. The woman behind the temping tubs of Cedar Crest ice cream told me to continue on to the Smoke House section of the establishment for my pick-up.  The restaurant portion of the is nicely decorated with brown barn wood, wagon wheels, and red checkered picnic tablecloths.  You can see the open kitchen from the counter, as you also have a great view of their various salads and cookies on display in the refrigerator display next to the register.  The Pulled Pork sandwich was neither pulled or smokey, contrary to the order-taker on the phone who told me everything is prepared in their smoker and smoked for hours. The meat was lukewarm, which was unappealing as I picture sinking my teeth into a steaming heap of succulent, hot sandwich. The meat arrived chopped and dry, BBQ sauces were provided on the side in little 4 oz plastic containers, simply labeled '1' and '2'. I believe 2 was the spicier of the two. The pork, while good, simply didn't blow me away.  My side of onion rings turned out to be 6 soggy, unremarkable SYSCO blasphemies. Disappointing considering the upcharge. Chips ordinarily accompany the handhelds.  The loaded fries, costing more than half the menu was another let down. It was again, SYSCO steak fries topped with unremarkable white cheese, finely shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, diced tomatoes and \"chunks\" of brisket. The brisket was the standout, short slices of delicate meat had nice charred coloring in the corners with a flavorful and marbled middle. It had a pleasing taste and was not tough.  To say I was impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant, more so than the actual food is a little sad. But hopefully, they'll workout some of their flaws a few weeks after opening."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughters. Thought the prices were very high for what we got. I got the BLT which I think *could* have been good but instead of mayonnaise it had the weirdest, sweet sauce on it. The smell of the sauce actually made me gag. I asked the waitress what it was and she said she didn't know. She made no attempt to find out.  The ice cream parlor part has a nice selection but they scoop very small. I came back with my mom and she couldn't believe the small size of the scoop for the money.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ziggy's graciously donated free chicken salad sandwiches for teacher appreciation week! The sandwich came with a generous portion of chips and a pickle, the perfect deli lunch combo. The sourdough bread was served panini-style, and the chicken salad is chilled. A little messy, but good savory flavors.   I took my food to go, but the decor in here is what you would expect from a BBQ joint: southern style, wood throughout, gingham patterns. I noticed there's also a nice patio and a little bar too! Cute addition to the downtown Oregon food scene."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place.  We just moved from Monroe and are in desperate search of a local \"Pancho and Leftys\".  While Ziggy's does have potential, it still has a long way to go.  We ordered carry out the first time we ate at Ziggy's.  I had the brisket which was not at all tender.  The mashed potatoes taste like they were in a warmer for hours on end.  The corn bread was good, that's about it though.  The second time we actually went to Ziggy's and ate inside.  I was shocked when we walked in and saw that it wasn't a full service restaurant.  You order at a counter and they bring out your food.  They have a few paper menus taped to a chalkboard for you to choose from.  For the prices they charge it should 100% be a full service restaurant.  Also everything comes out on plastic trays with waxed paper and the sides come out in styrofoam containers; hardly impressive.  There is also no alcohol served but I believe they are still working on their liquor license.  So this time around I had a plain cheeseburger and fries.  The cheeseburger came out with tomato and lettuce on it although I specified plain.  We also order my daughter a cheeseburger but they forgot the cheese.  My burger was good but it came out only warm, which made me worry it wasn't brought up to the correct temperature when cooked.  Fries were good, but nothing special.  We also had the cheese curds which were good as well.  We also went to the other of the restaurant to have ice cream and I will say it's a little pricy; nearly $3 for 1 scoop in a dish.  I am still hopeful for Ziggy's as it is still very new.  But if they don't eventually go to full service or at least lower the prices to reflect that then we probably won't be back.  We have family visiting regularly and this is not someplace I would want to bring them as of yet."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ, good live music, outdoor seating, and a large ice cream selection make for a nice addition to downtown Oregon."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am not much of a review writer. The atmosphere in Ziggy's is great. Nice little small town ice cream parlor and smokehouse.  I had the 2 meat combo with ribs and brisket. Very generous portions. Both we fantastic. Tried the tangy and hot sauces. My wife and I really liked both. Waffle fries and mac and cheese were the sides. Enjoyed both. My new favorite place in Oregon for sure."}
{"text":"We had the combo dinner with the ribs and brisket. The ribs were amazing. The brisket was pretty tough and fatty. If you take the time to trim the meat you can get some very nice chucks but again it was very tough.  The beans were excellent as well as the cornbread. The prices were also very good for everything you get. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Ziggy's is a great stop for decent BBQ in a small town. It's a family run business so that's nice. I had the pork butt entree with BBQ baked beans, Mac and cheese, and corn bread. Yummy! Service was a bit slow, and they out of ribs, but otherwise it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great spot, food is excellent. We have visited several times in the past couple weeks and are never disappointed. Their pulled pork entree is flavorful, not too smokey and not to spicy - but enough to give it some very good, unique flavors. Sides are generous and very well done. BBQ sauces are great, I'm partial to the Carolina flavor.   Don't skip the fried pickle spears..."}
{"text":"We at where for the first time last night and really enjoyed our dinner. We each had the combo platter of ribs and brisket. Both were cooked well and had a nice smoky flavor. I like that you get to choose your own sauce too. We had a variety of sides and they were good too with our favorites being the coleslaw, sweet potato fries and the corn bread with honey butter.  The atmosphere was good and they had some nice blues playing over their system. The staff and owner were really friendly and attentive and you can tell they're really proud of what they do here. It's definitely worth a visit and we will be back."}
{"text":"Well I called to have a group of 34 come in. Was told they would have to call me back.   Still haven't heard back and it's been two weeks.  I figure if a large group isn't welcomed and they can't just say that what other issues are there?"}
{"text":"The new BBQ joint in Oregon is open and starting to get their feet under them. The ice cream section is great, as is the rehab of the building and patio area.   Our table had the kid's tenders and the brisket \"dinner\". The tenders got a rave review. After dousing my brisket in hot BBQ sauce, it was pretty good too. The sides of mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese also earned something around a B plus.   The size of the brisket portion was laughable. Two small slices, maybe 4 ounces tops, of cool dry brisket on a piece of white bread for $14.95?!? Guests who order this will be incensed.    Our order came in about 35 minutes. We were the lucky ones, as two other guests stood waiting for orders the entire time we were there.  The obligatory \"I wanna see the manager!\" conversation ensued, and I get the impression that it is a regular occurrence.  There is opportunity to own the BBQ market in Oregon. Some focus on organization, service and the fury- inducing \"dinner\" portion is necessary to hope to make it."}
{"text":"If you are into greasy ribs this is the place for you.  Did I mention they were dry and hard to get off the bone?"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend after lunch on a weekday, so we had the place mostly to ourselves. The service was great and super attentive. The food was even better. I got the combo plate with chicken and BBQ ribs, side of mash and green beans. The bf got half rack of their new Texas BBQ rubbed ribs, mac & Cajun fries. Both came with a side of corn bread, which I didn't want to end! (So yum.)   The meat was super tender and moist. The ribs were great alone but they also had their own home made BBQ sauces which were bomb. I tried the tangy and sweet, both very good. The mash was flavorful and Cajun fries were perfectly cooked and yummy.  Definitely coming back and recommend! If your not local to Oregon, make the trip!"}
{"text":"I tried the combo: two meats and two sides. Ribs were excellent! Great flavor by itself, good texture, seems like quality meat. I tried the brisket, it was ok. I don't get brisket very often, so I'm not sure what to expect, but it seemed rather dry and over cooked. Green beans were nice and vinagery. Cornbread was just right. The unexpected standout for me was the chips- very thin, waffle cut potato chips that were perfectly fried!  I'm in Oregon often and look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Oregon area and had dinner here with wife, kids and mother in law. I had the rack of ribs (Texas rub) with steak fries, mac and cheese and corn bread. First off, I loved the ribs, the rub was perfect with the sauces they make. The ribs were cooked perfect! The fries are decent and the mac and cheese was smooth and tasted homemade. The cornbread was good, not dry! My wife had the brisket which she said was decent. The atmosphere was nice, good for kids and family. The staff were friendly and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a whim after being told we'd have to wait at another nearby restaurant. We were totally blowin away and impressed by the amazing food and the ambience. My husband got the chicken tendermelt and I got the two meat platter with pork and brisket. We also got the deep fried pickles, as my husband is some what of a connoisseur. They were delish, crispy and flavorful. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with dinner for the first time but we like the ice cream parlor.  The ribs were greasy, way to salty, dry and tough to chew.  The perch was not anything to rave about but it was better than the ribs.  We will not go back because there are much better options in town.  For the price we could have been much happier at places next door."}
{"text":"The burger was really yummy!! My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich didn't have much flavor with it but there was a lot of meat that was lean and they give u 3 choices of bbq sauce which were all yummy! Their onion rings were awesome and I usually don't like onion rings. Their fries were nothing special and I probably wouldn't get those again! We will definitely be back there!"}
