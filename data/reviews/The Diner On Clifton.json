{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service here has just gotten worse and worse the past couple years.

The owner is really cool, but the vast majority of the staff is constantly short and bitchy with customers. They also don't attend very well to detail with orders, or estimated timelines for takeout. The last two times I ordered takeout, my wait was double what was quoted (40 minutes when 20 was stated).

This place is officially \"blacklisted\" until further notice."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese is super as were the chicken philly and sourdough onion rings! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"How disappointing. Attempted to dine here this evening one last time before they close this location next week. Sat down in a booth with two of my friends. Waited fifteen minutes. Not a single staff member greeted us, brought us menus, water or anything. Two individuals who came in after us were being served as we left and one of the servers looked at us like she had no idea there were three people sitting at the table that emptied out. It's a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite places. Now all the old employees are gone and it shows."}
{"text":"It's a tiny, classy little diner right on the edge of Lakewood. Not good if you're trying to seat more than 5 people, but if there's just one or two of you, it's perfect.

The hamburger was great and they gave me honey for my fries when I asked for it (not all restaurants do!). Good coffee, friendly waitress, decent prices.

As always, pictures of the interior, food and a link to the menu are on my blog: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/08/diner-on-clifton.html"}
{"text":"Best Diner food in Cleveland hands down. I've been going here for at least 10 years and have never had a less than perfect meal.  I love the sweet potato fries and the Artichoke Dill dip... Oh!  And the Tuna Melt!  Best atmosphere, staff, and food!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner based on positive yelp reviews. It is a nice little place on the corner. After we sat down, the server immediately took our drinks, which was nice. After the drinks I saw him glaring at us numerous times throughout our meal, as if we were unwelcome. We ordered a Greek Salad to start, with the cucumbers, feta cheese, and dressing on the side. I have an intolerance towards cucumbers and was with a vegan. The salad came out with only the dressing on the side and the server didn't even attempt to have it fixed before bringing it to us(we could hear everything from the open kitchen from our booth). For my entrée, I ordered the salmon the server recommended; the salmon came with mashed squash which was noticeably microwaved due to it being ice cold in the middle. The salmon was very dry and old, but the string beans it came with were alright. The entrée came with a vegetable chowder which tasted as if it came directly out of a can. My date had a mushroom wrap. It looked really good when it came out, it was stuffed with mushrooms and other vegetables. Every bite she took squeezed a disgusting amount of water or juice out of her wrap. During our entire sitting, the server never asked about the food and didn't even seem remotely concerned about our dissatisfaction. I do not know how a place like this has the rating it does."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've seen a few reviews about this artichoke dill bake and I just knew I had to try it.  I've always enjoyed artichoke dips of all varieties, but DAYUM, this one may have ruined me for life!  For real.  Plus the seasoned pita chips (that are clearly freshly made) are to die for on their own!  I really don't think I'll order it elsewhere for a good long time.  You really should go, even if it's for that dip alone!

I had a greek salad, which was ok, nothing special and my dining mate had the grecian chicken pita, which she really enjoyed.

I mean, I will really be back here (more often I'd probably like to admit) for artichoke dip.  Plus the place is cute and I'm going to have to try some breakfast items.  It is a diner, after all."}
{"text":"i had breakfast there yesterday. i had the veggie omelet and it was AMAZING!! the service was great too. the only complaint was the piped in music was a bit too loud for my taste. often, it was hard to hear my friends. that aside, this is a must for diner food. btw, i had a burger there a few months ago and it too was FANTASTIC. thanks everyone for making my dining experience very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This has got to be the greatest diner in all of the Cleveland area. The food and service are a10 all day."}
{"text":"This place has fun decor - not a hole in the wall, but not upscale either. It has a pretty diverse menu, but I've only actually had burgers here. The burgers and fries (and yes, shakes) are really good. My friend complained about the prices for a diner, but the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Food was simple but delicious. Staff was polite and attentive. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been going to The Diner for years, and have never been disappointed.  My favorites include the Artichoke Dill Bake, Sweet Potato Fries, and lately, the Mesculin Salad (which is huge -- enough for several servings).  In the past, I've also been a big fan of their breakfast, but it's been a while so I won't comment on specifics.

The desserts I've tried have been excellent, and a family member even liked one of their cakes so much that she has since ordered several full sized cakes through The Diner's baker.

The atmosphere is very laid-back, especially when it isn't crowded.  I've seated myself, taken the check up to the counter to pay, et cetera.  But the experience is always enjoyable."}
{"text":"A great diner. It is what it is. A small diner with sassy ladies working there. Take it for the gem it is! Food is diner style and good at being that. Although I've never tried desserts look amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on April 19, 2014.  The boyfriend and I, with my 12 and 10 year old \"nieces\" in tow, stopped for lunch after having been at the science center.   I had looked up and printed the menu.   Little surprises with the prices ( little higher than expected and the menu I printed did not say that pancakes are only served until 11 a.m. so some confusion.)  My \"nieces\" had to be meatless since it was Friday during Lent, so the boyfriend was a good sport and ordered the hummus wrap sans chicken so as not to taunt the girls. I had the artichoke dip, my 10 year old mac and cheese freak (just like her Aunt:) ) had the side of mac and the 12 year old had eggs with home fries.   Everything was prompt and hot.  

If Thursday is cruciferous vegetable night, do not order the dip. Just saying that as a personal warning.  Trust me. ( I had sauerkraut the night before....oops.)  So, if you are a risk taker or Thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night, then PLEASE  get the dip and take me with you!  Oh my......this is the stuff of dreams.  Dill, cream cheese, feta and whole chunks of artichoke......*drool* sorry, wiping off keyboard... I make a good hot artichoke dip myself, and I thought that was good.  Forget the tasteless wallpaper paste dips from the chain restaurants of the 90's, this is so light and tasty .  Comes with homemade lemon pepper pita chips...if you are sharing, I suggest getting a second side order of chips.  I ran out of chips before dip.  I actually ate half, took half home and go two more snacks (sizeable) out of the rest. 

The mac and cheese was so good! I had to fight to get a taste, but I so want more!   My homemade is still the best, but this is a close second.  According to my other \"niece\" her eggs and home fries were really good.   The  only misstep was the humus wrap, Finding the hummus was the first problem and the second was that is mostly a lettuce sandwich.  What hummus we could find was so-so (we are spoiled by homemade I admit) but still not bad over all.  Many dishes we want to try, so we will go back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a few years, and I remember it being pretty good but nothing impressive.  Well, I stopped in for a quick lunch this past sunday and now I'm sorry that it took me so long to go back there.  It was delicious!  I got the chicken salad croiossant sandwich with fries, and my fried had the tuna melt.  We were both pleased with the food- that was probably the best chicken salad I have ever had.  Fresh ingredients, and all white meat chicken.. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everyone already loves The Diner on Clifton and knows that the menu has something for everyone... I have (3) most-favoritest, tastiest, cant get enough, offerings that I die for....

1. Artichoke Dill Bake: Best hangover cure in America. Best PMS food in America. Best, I need to treat myself to something ridiculous because Im doing \"ME\" today food in America. I literally die for this ap. 

2. The Salads: Amazing, full portions, full flavor, meal salads. Semi-standard offerings but with that \"Diner on Clifton\" kick. My personal favorites are the mescaline w/ chicken, Greek w/ chicken, and the BBQ Cobb.

3. The Soups: Last but not least, their homemade soups. Butternut squash, creamy tomato basil, loaded baked potato, veg chowder, etc..."}
{"text":"This place just gets better and better for me. I used to stop in just for breakfast (their French Toast and omelets are delicious) but happened to order lunch instead one day. I had the Greek Salad and the boyfriend got the Diner Club - holy moses. The portions are HUGE and the salad was divine. It came with lemon-pepper pita chips and I could eat a whole bag of them. 

They also make my now-favorite soup in the world: their everyday offering - Garden Chowder. It's creamy, healthy, and so flavorful. I get it to go now because I'm addicted. I live closeby, but would definitely still go if I didn't live close. The servers are always friendly and the food comes out fast. You really couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Clean and fast service. The food is fresh and very tasty. I recommend for anytime of day."}
{"text":"I went here as an alternative location and I was very pleased. The reason I came back again, was loved the quality and low prices. The rainbow flags did not bother me. 
 The hot Asparagus dip is tasty and plentiful, and the pita bread perfectly cooked. The second time I came back, the mushroom ravioli was decadent and flavorful. My date's salad had two substitutions, and there was no question about it. They just did our request perfectly. The salads are huge, so pace yourself. The food is carefully presented on the plates and just dumped on like many other diners.
 I live 40 miles away, but am willing to go here for good food, and will many more times. The prices are in the lower range, with only about a  dozen dinner entrees ranging from $9.95 to $13.95."}
{"text":"The diner has improved so much since I first started going there (2006).  It's a great place to meet friends for lunch because they are reasonably priced and have a range of options, even vegetarian. Also a staple hangover breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Love this place. My fiance and I fell in love here over the course of many visits. We have since had children and are no longer regulars, but will definitely come back any chance we get. Their Mac & cheese is amazing, as is their pasta bake and gnocchi.
 My parents love the meatloaf! Service is always great!"}
{"text":"I go there all the time and the food is wonderful! Quiet and cozy. Love the breakfast!!!!"}
{"text":"Heather's wrap and garden chowder are awesome!! Miss living around the corner from this place, it's great!"}
{"text":"I just left this diner with a friend. I had the turkey burger with the sweet potatoes fries. The burger was big, juicy, and delicious. My friend ordered the fish sandwich and it looked just as good as my order. Our waiter was excellent, he was very attentive, and friendly. The rest of the staff was courteous too. I will be returning to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and the tuna sandwich was great. Then, I went to the restroom downstairs and I saw ground beef in the store room thawing at room temperature, uncovered. Have not been back since."}
{"text":"The food and service provided by the morning shift and the evening shift are polar opposites. So opposite and so bad it's almost comical. I much prefer the morning shift, especially on Sunday mornings. Morning shifts, while at times very busy, at least have the decency to provide you with kind, personable, and prompt service. With that, you get great food worth the wait and reasonably priced. More options to choose from. 

On the other hand, evenings provide with with mediocre food with some of the worst carelessness and rudeness I have dealt with in terms of service. God forbid you should order dinner to go, and god forbid you could be served a beverage while you wait as calling in seems questionable due to rude and impatient tones on the phone. The server was noticeably  bothered by a subtle, and patient presence while waiting for an order. Her cookie was more important for her dumb mouth rather than a polite request for a beverage not once, but three times, let alone any hope for a shred of polite decency. I HATE feeling like tipping should even be considered at all just because someone gave you something someone else worked their ass off for. If you don't care and you don't try you should get nothing. 

So go in the mornings, it's better that way in all regards."}
{"text":"One of the first places I ate when I moved to Cleveland was The Diner on Clifton and I have been going back ever since. I love the vintage feel of Diner but what I love more is the creativity of the menu. This isn't a traditional diner with greasy American fare. When you go in, expect to have an awesome spin on some of your diner favorites. Instead of a tuna melt, they serve up an excellent yellow fin tuna sandwich with sweet potatoes fries. Instead of fried pork chops and potatoes, they offer glazed pork chops with mashed yams, baked apples, and fresh cut green beans. Everything is cooked to perfection and the staff is always friendly and cheerful.

Great place for the weekend."}
{"text":"I'm lucky that this establishment is so close to my home.  A frequent out of town guest, a new yorker, and they know food, loves the clifton diner!  Their food is salt of the earth fantastic ..... chili-cheese fries, hot artichoke dip, cheeseburgers to die for, well-made omelets .... it's all good and there are some good healthy eating choices too.  I am an aficianado of their grilled chicken salad.   the ambiance is quite diner-pleasant, you're comfortable and not rushed.  If you can,  get a booth by the window."}
{"text":"The service in normally pretty fast and the food is always great! Everything is hot and tasty. I brought my family there after doing some shopping and they loved it! Not a good place for groups larger than 5 if you want to sit together."}
{"text":"Amazing. It's not your typical diner. It's better! Garden chowder is my fav. But honestly everything on their menu is great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend called in a simple order and the waitress was short and rude over the phone. I arrived at the dinner with a less than a warm welcome and after waiting to be greeted for a 5 mins. I had to wait an extra 20 mins for our food. Not a thanks for being patient or apology ...just attitude. French fries were under fried and un seasoned. This place has been blacklisted."}
{"text":"get the artichoke dill bake.
now.
go now.
seriously.
why are you still reading this?
go now.
NOOOOOW."}
{"text":"Best potatoes ever!

Came here for the second time today. Both times, my party was extremely lucky and got seated right away. I've heard the wait here can be annoying, especially during peak brunch times.  The first time was really early, like around 9am, and there were plenty of seats.  Today, we got there around 11:30 and happened to grab a booth just as others were leaving.

Our waitress paid us a lot of attention, kept refilling the coffee, and didn't seem to mind too much that we were waiting on a fourth person to show up.  Our food was brought out so quickly too!

And it was gooood.  I had the egg scrambler with broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and two types of cheese.  They actually listened when I requested the butter on the side for the toast.  And those potatoes -- man! I love those!  They were so soft, but also crispy on one side.  They were done perfectly and weren't too spicy like some homefries at diners tend to be.

My companions loved their breakfast burritos (two of them got that) and the hummus wrap with chicken and fries that looked really good.  Speaking of looking good?  Their cake and pie display.  Wow!

Nothing majorly stood out to me about this diner, except that it was a totally pleasant experience and the food was excellent.  A great alternative to Lucky's (for those wishing to save $$) or Tap House (for those wishing to actually SEE their food when they eat it)."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is close, easy, fast and has great menu options makes it a regular dining choice. Breakfast is always hot and served quick, no matter how busy, even on Sunday morning. I usually order a breakfast scramble, but I've sampled the chorizo burrito and omelets. I always get a soup because they're awesome. Recently I tried the cabbage and beef - real pieces of shaved beef, huge chunks of cabbage, big pieces of carrots and noodles - it was great. I've had several salads wraps and sandwiches for lunch and have never had a bad meal. The waitresses are always the same over the past three years that I've been going there and they are less than personable. The guy that works there is a sweetheart though, and whenever he's working he picks up our table. Love the corner, there's always action so if you're there hungover and not up for much conversation it's nice to just sit and stare out the window!"}
{"text":"My very first boyfriend Kurt and I fell for each other over greasy eggs at 3 in the morning at the Clifton Diner.  Chrissie Hynde's doppleganger was slinging the hash--literally--at a drunk guy at the counter who had grabbed her ass as she passed by.  Another couple's relationship was coming unglued two formica booths over, but all I could see was Kurt's blue eyes and high cheekbones.  Did he really think I'd fall for that line, \"You know you look just like Bryan Adams?\"  that he fed me at Chapter Two, then the biggest and most popular gay bar in Cleveland?  I did, twenty minutes later we were in the Clifton Diner playing footsie, and a whole new era in my life started--Official Boyfriends.  Kurt was the first, but he wasn't the last, or the best.  The Clifton Diner wasn't the best, of anything, but it was awesome, and I hope it still is."}
{"text":"My 3 star rating is not based on the food. It is based on the sanitary conditions I noticed while dining here. As someone who used to work in food services some things just really shocked me. Truth be told, I am sure a lot of places have some faulty things they do but when they are visible to the whole restaurant and you see things happen in front of your eyes it's a little disconcerting.

The food itself was actually very good. I tried the chicken salad which is served on a delicious toasted croissant. The service was fast and we were seated in a packed restaurant only after about 5 minutes of waiting. They have great turn around to cater to their small space."}
{"text":"i went to the Diner on Clifton about two years ago and remember it being good, but my experience today shot that \"good\" through the roof. 

I have the yellowfin tuna sandwich and my friend got the Manhattan Rueben. Both were by far two of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. The fish was perfect, the caper mayo was phenomenal, the slaw on the reuben was delicious (I don't like slaw) and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and steamy on the inside.

The atmosphere is exactly how a diner should be. You can see the kitchen and it's really fun watching what goes on back there. The bar is also a cute addition and I'll probably sit there next time. I didn't go to the restroom, but I did notice that you have to walk through the kitchen a bit to get there, so that's a tiny bit weird...but certainly not off-putting enough to turn me away. 

I'm not hungry again yet, but I think I might go pick at my leftovers soon..."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have ordered a salad for lunch at a diner.  But that's neither here nor there.  My Cobb salad featured lettuce that should have been pitched a few days prior - it wasn't just brown, it was wilted and soggy.

There is no excuse for lack of freshness in my book.

Beyond this particular issue, there was the scalding hot coffee that was poured carelessly and burned my hand.  Twice.  My server wasn't so busy that he had to rush in pouring me another cup and, in doing so, he left me with a small burn that did end up blistering.  It was, really, indefensible.

I will say that the other patrons around me that ordered breakfast seemed to be pleased with their meals.  Sadly, I had such a bad experience that I just can't see myself going back for round 2."}
{"text":"I have lived in Lakewood for about 5 years and have pretty much tried everything on their menu. The food is just amazing. 

I typically get the bacon omelette or the eggs Benedict. Their deli sandwhichs are fantastic as well. You can order carry out too. Even though this place is small you never wait too long for a table to open up. Staff and service is great. 

Whenever someone new moves to the area I tell them this is the first place they need to go."}
{"text":"Cozy little corner diner, a but loud tho' friendly. Standards with a twist ... nice. Clifton is currently being repaired so you have to find parking about a block away. The diner is worth the walk, though.
G"}
{"text":"Garden Chowder soup is delicious.  Burgers and wraps are very good.  Well, actually everything is pretty tasty and the staff is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful, casual diner. Great food, veg-and-vegan friendly. Incredibly accomodating, great staff who are very attentive (and remember regulars!). One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Wonderful desserts. Very clean. I agree the bathrooms are definitely the only complaint I have. Everything else is delightful."}
{"text":"I've been here probably about 10-15 times. 

This place is a nice hipster-ish diner with a small and narrow space that seats roughly 40 i'd guess. During dinner it's usually pretty busy but aside from holidays i haven't noticed anyone having to wait. Small back parking lot is full typically during dinner hour but always has spots come breakfast or lunch time.

Service has been good and consistent. Food comes out pretty quick and the waitstaff is pleasant. I usually get food to go and they always offer me water and refills when i'm waiting. Place is pretty clean and the kitchen is open which i always like. Bathrooms are in the basement but also clean and private for that matter. 

Food: My favorite entree here is their Wild Mushroom Ravioli, which comes in a sage cream sauce. Great dish i don't usually find at other places. They make all their salad dressings and the salads that come with the entrees are a very good size. They also make a pretty good Rueben with their house-made potato chips which I enjoy. The NY strip is OK, usually lacks seasoning and they haven't quite nailed medium rare each time i've tried but the onions and mushrooms are sauteed well. Their sour cream and chive mashed potatoes are great. Most of the menu is pretty much from scratch and the quality of their ingredients/suppliers shows. Therefore the prices are fair to me, you get what you pay for. Overall my go-to place for breakfast/lunch/dinner if i'm not trying to spend a lot and don't want to drive far (it's within walking distance to me)"}
{"text":"I think the food here is really great!! Very NY feel to this place! I love the diner fries and their soups are really good! I do think it's pricey for diner food but I am willing to spend it when in the mood for the atmosphere and food.
Only 2 complaints...going to the bathroom is disgusting..you have to walk through the kitchen which somehow feels wrong, lol and the stairs going to the dungeon are hideous!! I think they are making enough money to do a minor renovation and make the restroom experience nice.
My only 2nd complaint is the staff!! They are the worst!!!!!!! The waitresses and waiters have the snobbiest 'I can't be bothered' attitudes...as if the constant rush of customers has gone to their heads. I never don't tip but one day I left without tipping a woman there who had the nerve to comment that we were eating too much food!!! Hysterical! And the guy waiter..well, he's hit or miss..some days almost cheerful and funny but on most completely distracted and uninterested. So the the only reason I go is for the ny atmosphere and the food is good but always end up feeling the person didn't deserve my very generous tip (I'm a big tipper). I wonder if the staff are the owners and if not, if the owners know how badly their staff behaves on most days. 
Otherwise..awesome place!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  If you haven't tried it already, what are you waiting for.

The place is small, yet comfortable.  My SO and I were able to sit down at the bar almost right after walking in.  We went for lunch, but we were still able to order breakfast which made it so hard to choose on what to eat.  I sipped on the coffee while I waited.  It was a bit strong, but good.  My boyfriend chose the turkey club and I chose the Santa Fe wrap.

I was hooked before the food even arrived because the waitstaff was phenomenal.  They were very personable and talked to you.  They were very good at making you feel at home.  I found it enjoyable watching the waitresses sing along to (the reasonably audible) music.  They seemed to really enjoy their jobs.

Now on to the food, the wrap was amazing.  It was a very generous size and it came with a huge portion of home made tortilla chips with salsa, guacamole, and a side of sour cream.  These weren't your run of the mill tortilla chips, they were fresh, hot, and crunchy.   I've never had anything like them before and I can't wait to get some more in the future.  The Santa Fe wrap was nice and messy as it was loaded with chicken, black beans, cheddar, and salsa.  It was nice and crunchy on the outside.  The whole plate was so good that I ate the whole thing in one sitting.  My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich as well.  I didn't try the sandwich (it had bacon on it and I don't eat pig products), but I did try the home made potato chips and they were also very delicious.

I can't wait to come back to this place, there are so many things I would like to try."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great breakfast options until 2pm.  I am partial to the old-school, no-frills stuff like an egg over-easy and an English muffin.  The service is great and they play great tunes.  Always crowded."}
{"text":"Had the Ruben for the first time...meat was fatty, sandwich not very flavorful. Also had the Santa Fe Wrap, always good. Also red skin potato salad...always good too."}
{"text":"So now they have something I'm hooked to...their fish is AWESOME but still not too keen on the service.


It was okay, it didn't really blow my mind. I got the egg white omelette with ham."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. My go to meal is the mesculin salad- field greens, candied pecans, blue cheese, chicken and a homemade honey balsamic dressing. The tuna club and heather wrap are good and I love the diner fries too!"}
{"text":"Very good for breakfast, I swing by before I head to Flower Child. They have REAL orange juice."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries and artichoke dip are delicious!  The waitress is really nice and the service is quick."}
{"text":"great diner food. Definitely not one of those 24 hour, only good when I'm drunk places. Sweet potato fries... need I say more?
Only problem I ever encounter is do I seat myself or wait to be seated?"}
{"text":"The best diner food I've had.  I've never been disappointed selecting something random off the menu.  The vegetarian options are particularly flavorful.  The prices are reasonable and service is also top notch, so we always eat here when visiting Cleveland.  We once traveled to Cleveland from the East coast just because I was craving their mushroom soup.  (I called.  It was the soup of the day.  The stars were aligned.  We drove.) Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I'd call this my local, sans booze (they don't serve on premises). A 50's style diner minus the silly outfits, this place serves fresh, good food at amazing prices. In the four years I lived in Cleveland I ate there countless times, and never had a single complaint. Go, enjoy."}
{"text":"personally don't think you'll go wrong with anything you order. Fabulous salads, tasty burgers, I hear the mac and cheese is a winner, and the BLT is always a favorite. I've yet to have their breakfasts, but I can't fathom they're anything less than delicious. Overall, it's a good place with decent service."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. My go-to here is almost always The Diner Breakfast. The seasoning that they use on the home fries is dynamic and is a great compliment to the potatoes.
Tonight I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was great. The portion size was MASSIVE. 2 huge breaded chicken breasts, a side of spaghetti, and a side salad that is bigger than most regular salads. The flavor of the sauce was really on point.

The only reason it isn't 5 stars is due to the fact that some of the items are a bit pricey. $5 for the breakfast with no meat is a little much. But $12 for the chicken parm is a great deal."}
{"text":"Wonderfully friendly and attentive service! My sweetheart and I started with the artichoke dip which was pure perfection. Creamy, cheesy, hot perfection. Complete with fresh pita chips. My wife enjoyed the veggie chili which she said \"doesn't try to be anything other than chili without meat.\" I had a patty melt with sweet potato fries, and my sweetheart had mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Everything was good. Not fancy, but good.  We did wish for a bit more seasoning on most things, but when you want good, classic diner food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Walked in with a long wait for weekend brunch, typical of many highly rated Yelp diners. The atmosphere is stylish and quaint, a bit cramped between tables. The staff was handling the rush professionally and remained attentive but still seemed overwhelmed. Great quality of breakfast and menu options. Looks like a regular hangout for the quirky and artistic youth."}
{"text":"I love diners. In fact, the cheesier and home style, the better. However, this place hardly felt like \"home.\" The staff seemed less-than-thrilled and the establishment is hardly accommodating. I don't eat fries or chips, but the only way I could sub this for anything, was by paying two dollars. I wasn't asking for soup or salad, just a scoop of veggies or something.  Wow. 

I'm disappointed. When I told the waitress that I don't eat fried stuff, she told me this wasn't the place for me. Wow x2. 

Just not very pleasant. And the food seemed mediocre at best. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Always have great food at this place. Service is decent! The only thing is that each and every time I use the restroom, it always looks dirty and the smell is extremly offensive!"}
{"text":"Man, this is place is so great. The delicious food is consistent, the crowd is interesting, and the prices are affordable. The waitresses are usually attentive and always kind. Parking may be a problem if you visit during the weekend lunch rush. Seating is also limited, but the wait is always worth the time.

If you want breakfast, this is the best place in CLE! Their veggie omelet includes fresh assortments of vegetables and cheese. For lunch, their hot turkey with mashed potatoes is always comfortingly tasty. Ah, I'm salivating as I write this.

Since portions are typically large, expect to take a nap after your meal. But give this place a shot if you haven't already. It's the best and my all-time favorite!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and off the rip I seemed to have bothered the waitress because she was in the middle of her breakfast. customer service left something to be desired!   I got a milkshake that was more like an overpriced chocolate milk. Overall not a good experience, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a early saturday. Service was slow but I enjoyed the atmosphere there was patio service. The prices were very affordable. Food was fairly decent although the portion size was really small. I tried the corned beef hash and it was preety ok. My friend ordered staek and eggs and said it was ok. We will go back again before having anything negative to say."}
{"text":"I should mention right away that I had fish and chips and I would have it again. The fish was crisp and not overly greasy, the fries were equally well prepared.  The tarter sauce was cool, creamy and tart.  It also came with Cole slaw which I ignored because I was more interested in the main event.

So in keeping with my systematic review of fish n chips.
1. Fish wash white and flakes and decent portion. 5/5
2. Batter.  Golden and crispy, not too greasy. 5/5.
3. Chips. Plentiful and not soggy. 5/5.
4. Accompaniments.  No lemon :( good tartar sauce. No malt vinegar  :(  2/5
5 x factor.  Nice server.  Cute place.  Coleslaw was not appetizing. 4/5.


That averages to a 4.2 rounded down that's a respectable 4."}
{"text":"For years and years I've driven by this place and never gone in to eat, but at the suggestion of my girlfriend we stopped in for brunch.  I was impressed with the decor and the friendly staff.  The menu has enough options that even the pickiest of eaters should be able to find something to satisfy their tastes.

I went with the Western omelette.  Loaded with generous portions of ham, peppers, and onions.  The homefries were cooked to crispy perfection!

She had the eggs Benedict.  It looked okay if that's your thing.  (I'm not a fan of runny eggs).

This is a great neighborhood diner, and they put out some fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Lots of great veg options, and a fun atmosphere.

My dad and I used to eat here at the counter, when it was known as Clifton Lunch.  It's probably my favorite diner in Cleveland.

There are lots of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from, from pastas and wraps to salad and my favorite, the veg chili.   The desserts are also great.  The staff tends to be cute too.

Oh, and it's right next to Twist, a fun gay bar."}
{"text":"By far the best diner in the area.  Overall quality of food is above average.  You can't get better diner food for the price anywhere else in the neighborhood.  Breakfast comes highly recommended, but their dinner entrées are amazing!  Occasionally, the staff is bit flustered when things get busy, but this isnt a 5 star restaurant so don't expect 5 star service."}
{"text":"Pork Chop dinner is the best ever!  Grilled just right, mashed sweet potatoes, carmelized apples and a large salad. Great!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great...

THE UP-SIDE:
This place received a major facelift a few years back.  It still maintains that \"diner\" charm, while offering a slightly healthier selection of eats.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This is one of those places where \"cool\" people \"in the know\" seem to congregate.  At times, it isn't so bad.  At other times, the \"scene-sters\" seem to overwhelm the place; take for instance, on a Sunday morning after a night of partying.  Either way, the food is pretty good, but no great shakes.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Not a bad diner to grab some food."}
{"text":"Sometimes I come here and am so happy with my food (the shepherds pie) and other times not so much (the diner dog). It's a cute place though and so close to my apartment. Everyone is friendly and service is fast. It's pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"One weekend when my parents came to visit, all the fancy brunch places were fully reserved and so they could not seat us. After turning to Yelp, I found this diner and from the photos I wasn't sure what to expect. My parents are pretty picky when it comes to food, and so I wanted them to enjoy their food so much more.

I finally parked and from the outside I was not impressed but upon entering, it's a cute place. It was fairly busy and after waiting about 15 minutes, we were finally seated. Our waitress was a total sweetheart and she was so informative and helpful. She came by often to check on us and see if anyone needed anything. SERVICE = 10 STARS

The food: WOWZA! SO SO SO YUMMY! It came out hot and beyond delicious. We all ordered breakfast food and although this was a few months ago, I can still remember the flavor of their buttermilk pancakes, so buttery! The best part is my parents really enjoyed breakfast and left happy, and so did I. 

Most of the customers looked like they were regulars. There are booths, regular tables, and bar style seating. Prices are great, food is great, service is great, what's there not to love?

Go on in and try this place!"}
{"text":"One of the saddest parts about moving out of the Clifton-Baltic hood was that I couldn't eat at The Diner on Clifton as much anymore. It's one of those pleasant neighborhood joints that you can go to alone and not feel awkward.

Easily some of the best diner food in the area. You MUST try the Eggs Benedict. I wonder where they get their bread from because the English muffins they used were super fresh and delicious. And those potatoes? Ohhh man! Normally, I don't even LIKE home fries. I'm not sure what they do to them but they're soooo good!

The staff here are out of this world friendly. So obviously, wonderful service. Most likely, you'll never be impatiently waiting for a thing here. 

Why can't this place be closer to my house? :("}
{"text":"BACK AGAIN

This is a delightful diner on the corner with friendly servers and good food. We stopped in for lunch and had a great Club Sandwich. This place has a nice down home feel to it.

What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and late night place. Not huge but it turns over quick as food is served fast. 

Diner Burrito, and Diner eggs Benedict are my go to favorites. (The Burrito is a huge serving.) But there are lots of good breakfast choices. Sorry no Gluten free here."}
{"text":"I was on vacation from work and had errands to complete on the Westside and consulted Yelp for a good place to stop and have breakfast.   I decided on the Diner on Clifton and was very satisfied with my choice.   I had the eggs benedict which came with hashbrowns and my daughter had the pancakes.    The eggs benedict was very good, the hollandaise sauce was fresh, creamy and delicious.   My daughter couldn't stop eating the pancakes even though she was full!   All-in-all, a very good breakfast, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Got in around 9 AM and it was probably a really good thing we did because by the time we were getting up to leave after finishing breakfast, the place only had a couple tables empty.

Nice waitress, prompt service, everything you expect at a traditional diner.  I got the eggs benny and the hollandaise sauce was excellent, like the nice touch of asparagus along with it as well.  Solid hashbrowns but they could have used a little more seasoning on them.

Dad got the traditional eggs and bacon, pretty hard to screw that up, lol

and they gave me my hot chocolate with whipped cream on top (many places in Cleveland have been skipping on the whipped cream, so I was happy!)

Solid, cheap breakfast spot with good food selection for breakfast, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Everyone else is right: YOU HAVE TO TRY THE ARTICHOKE BAKE. It is amazing! The lemon pepper chips they serve it with are to die for as well. 

Great for breakfast, good for lunch/dinner. Their garden chowder is good, their turkey burger...not so much.

One downside: the size of the restaurant is pretty small, so if you go when it's busy you may have to wait... but they have take out if you're near by!"}
{"text":"i went to the diner on clifton the again and i got 4 nice sized pieces of french toast, enough egg whites to make an omelet, and a nice portion of home fries all for just over $10.  Needless to say i was beyond satisfied. this place continues to impress. the french toast...yes!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday eve with the luminescent Elizabeth, kind of a spur of the moment decision. I've passed by the joint perhaps 700 times and have never ventured in.

We ventured.

Despite a somewhat \"Get the Fuc% out of our store\" aura (they seemed as if they were closing soon...is it no longer 24hr...?), the staff *acted* pleasant, and sat us in a comfy booth by the window. If you've got a comfy booth by the window, I'm probably going to like your place...so it was a good start.

I took a chance and got one of their specials, a mushroom ravioli in cream+prosciutto sauce with peas. Elizabeth got a Santa Fe wrap.

So...for a diner...the dish was pretty freaking good! The sauce congealed nicely, not too runny, and there were 5-6 raviolis in there that broke into 4 bites each. I'd definitely order it again.

Elizabeth's wrap was...oh crap...I forgot to ask her how her food was. Man, I can be a tool sometimes. It wasn't on purpose though...I just forgot...I forget a lot of little things like that. Crap.

As we were wrapping it up, the aura grew a bit thicker, as they clearly wanted us the fuc% out of their store. We left in peace.

Dope spot. I'll be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Went here for the 2nd time today. The staff just like the first time, was pleasant to deal with and extremely welcoming. The food was great, and came in pretty big portions. I ordered the white trash burger, its basically a cheeseburger with bacon and grilled onions, it was cooked perfect, and had plenty of bacon (I've been noticing a lot of places becoming stingy with the extras so I figured I'd mention that). The girlfriend ordered the chicken salad croissant sandwich, it was huge and she enjoyed it. She also had some sweet potato fries and the vegetarian chili, both something she would recommend. Overall, after two good visits we will defiantly be coming here a little more often. Plus the girlfriend really wants to try the spinach gnocchi which isn't on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Every neighborhood should have a place like this. One of those go-to joints with great food, reasonable prices and friendly staff. 

I have been going to the Clifton Diner since it was a 24hr hole-in-the-wall. I loved it then, but I love it even more now. The menu is pretty substantial, you can get breakfast all day and most things are house-made.

Lately, I have been fixated on the grilled chicken salad to try and keep it healthy. All their salads are huge and dressings are homemade. I love the ranch and blue cheese. The grilled chicken is some of the best. Very flavorful and has a nice char. Not the bland re-constituted variety. 

Other noteworthy items are the artichoke dip, mac n' cheese and breakfast burrito. I really haven't had much I didn't like.

I love the old school diner decor and the interesting cast of characters that frequent the joint. This place is one of my all time favs."}
{"text":"Everytime I am back in town I try to hit up this place from breakfast. I wish it was a little bigger so it wasn't so crowded. But WOW do they know what they are doing. Try the mac n cheese. Try the diner burrito. Hell, try anything... it's all good!"}
{"text":"This place has some tasty food. I've been here so many times now that I've lost count. Everyone needs a good diner close by! This isn't your traditional corner diner. They've got some flair on their menu. 
Breakfast here is great. I've had their omelets. They're huge. I really should have taken it home but it was so yummy I just kept eating. 
For lunch and dinner, I've had their soups and pastas and I think some sandwiches. Everything has been quite tasty. They basically agreed to make me a create your own mac and cheese once. That's pretty much the best. 
Their sweet potato fries are delicious. 
So swing by here if you're in the neighborhood. And even if you're not, it's worth a trip to check it out."}
{"text":"I'd give The Diner on Clifton 6 stars if I could. This is the nicest diner I have ever eaten at! Luckily I only live a 5 minute walk from the diner and find myself having breakfast or lunch here a few times a month.

Traditional diner food but unique and subtly upscale. Everything I've ordered has been delicious! I've noticed that when I've ordered the same thing more than once, it has been consistently prepared the same way.

The waitresses are phenomenal, the food is delicious, (and served FAST if you're in a rush to get back to work after your lunch hour) and the space is bright yet cozy. 

Come in on Sunday and have a slice of one of their fantastic cakes in the display case - Or order my favorite - sourdough onion rings! Yum!"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for a lunch.    Place is clean, they were missing a prep cook so no meatloaf :(

The waitress was patient (we were quite chatty so we did not order right away) and was prompt on the refills.

My 4-star was for two items...the restrooms are in the basement, and almost impossible for me on crutches.  And the mashed potatoes lacked seasoning but were real potatoes not instant.

Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Cleveland diner experience you need look no further than the Diner on Clifton. Sure it's not a \"real\" diner Airstream sleek with polished aluminum sides and a wall of windows, but when it comes to filling, affordable food you can't go wrong. We stopped in for a bite to eat on a Sunday morning. Our bellies were craving some good ole American breakfast food and we weren't disappointed.

The atmosphere has a cheesy quirkiness to it that just works. The brightly colored mosaic tile floor, the outer space-themed table tops complete with little stars, comets and swirling galaxies, and the textured walls all add to the ambiance. There's a long bar with swivel seats and comfy booths lining the walls. The place isn't that large so I can imagine it gets plenty crowded during peak hours. On the morning of our visit, around 8am, we had no trouble finding our way to a booth toward the kitchen in the back.

We were immediately greeted by one of the servers who took our drink order with authentic Cleveland friendliness - not over-the-top fakery, just a warm, honest smile. The coffee was good and hot and without asking we were both served waters. My wife went with a short stack and bacon and I opted for the Diner Breakfast, two scrambled eggs, buttered wheat toast, and home fries. I also chose the bacon option. It's not really breakfast unless you get bacon, right?

The pancakes were among the best we've ever had. They were cooked a perfect golden brown with a thin, crispy layer on the outside and soft, fluffy middles. They were all you could possibly want in a flapjack. My wife's bacon arrived cooked extra crispy, as ordered. As for my selection, they nailed it once again. Perfectly cooked scrambled eggs and bacon and the home fries, sliced rather than diced, had a good amount of caramelization and crispiness to them. This was just plain, straightforward breakfast goodness. We left with full bellies and smiles and aren't those the two things you want from a place like this? BTW, for two people the tab came to a shade over $15."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it a diner really, though it does have the aesthetic of one. The food is much better than diner quality.

I think people sometimes feel disappointed by this place because they may be expecting something more like you find in central Lakewood. A fusion restaurant with all kinds of bizarre dishes and a mile long beer list. I love those places but this isn't that kind of establishment. It is just a family friendly place with good food for a good price. They have your typical fair like omelets, burgers, pasta, sandwiches, salads, etc. and they are all good. Great for going out with kids or picky eaters.

Whenever I get stuck with someone who wants to drive way out of Lakewood to go to a Perkin's or an Eat n' Park I usually convince them to go here instead. The food is the same general no frills American dinner, the bill comes out to be the same, but the food is significantly better.

In short. No fuss food that tastes good, great location, and fantastic place to nurse your hangover with coffee and eggs."}
{"text":"If there was a 6th star, I'd highlight it.  I always visit the Diner on Clifton whenever I'm back in Cleveland.  Incredible food.  I've been going there for years, since back in 1999 when I used to live near there.  Decor hasn't changed, but it doesn't need to.  I say leave well enough alone and that's what they've done.  Lunch or dinner, this is the place to eat.  I recommend either the chicken caesar salad, or the southwest chicken wrap.  Both are mouth-watering.  Very quaint establishment with excellent service.  A must visit!"}
{"text":"At one time a distant and unknown cousin of mine was the chef at the Diner. Cousins, uncles, aunts, and nieces from my branch of the family decided to introduce ourselves to him at the diner. We took up most of the center of the small place where tables were pushed together to accommodate us. Between us we probably ordered everything our third cousin had on the menu. Sadly when we left it was unanimously agreed when one aunt stated odd that the only Hungarian who cannot cook ends up a chef. 

I live in that neighborhood and at times return to the Diner when a friend calls and wants to meet me there. My third cousin left long ago but every replacement shares his deficiencies in the kitchen. I have had the hamburgers, the omelets and a few specials of the day. Recently I met my friend Lydia here for breakfast as it was a Monday and most places were closed. Nothing was good. The prices were high for boring food. 

The decor is unsettling. The Fonz would run out of spray paint here. The Diner on Clifton is on my growing list of what is wrong with everyone else?"}
{"text":"Mmmm, what a great diner!

I had lunch here with a friend a few weekends ago and had the reuben with sweet potato fries. The reuben was a little greasy in the best possible way, and the sweet potato fries were PERFECT.. and I know sweet potato fries very, very well. 

It also seems like the perfect hangover-curing breakfast place.. but that has yet to be determined   ;)"}
{"text":"The best DIner in the City! Great food, Great Prices, and Great people!! I love your lemon-pepper pitas!!!"}
{"text":"This is an atypical diner.  It serves typical \"diner\" food, but with a gourmet twist, and made a tad healthier (although just a tad).  Some of the food here is absolutely outstanding.  Others of it is just good, but I've never had anything bad.  They offer sweet potato fries, wraps, etc. in addition to the standard diner fare.

I completely agree with Jim P's comment, however, about the general snootiness of the \"scene\" here.  While the atmosphere in here would be nice, there's something a little too upscale about it for me...it strikes me as a tad unfriendly, in that \"cool\" sort of way."}
{"text":"The meatloaf reminds me of home cooking and the white trash burger is awesome. It's a cute little diner with a nice variety of food (for being a diner). My only complaint is the servers could be more friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Simple and basic but that's all it takes. This diner is friendly, clean, efficient, affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm at a 3.5 star rating for my first experience at The Diner On Clifton! 

Like Yelper Russa W said, I feel the food is above average diner fare, but the service is really what shines here! 

First, let mention: 

- This was my first time here, therefore I've only had one dish
- We went during the Saturday brunch rush

When we walked it there was a wait for a booth or table, but luckily for us there were two counter seats open. We snagged those and were served piping hot diner coffee right away. Yum! I ordered the eggs Benedict and took in the sights and sounds of this bustling little diner while I waited. There isn't much room to move around in there, but I watched the happiest faces of patrons as they ate their breakfast burritos, eggs over easy with toast, sammies and other delicious diner fare. 

When our orders finally came up and I was super-excited to see extra crispy home fries piled on my plate. All too often home fries are not prepared crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. But there were perfect. The only thing that would have made them even better was Tabasco--unfortunately they only have Sriracha and Frank's. The eggs Benedict was prepared adequately, but not the best I've ever had. I immediately noticed the hollandaise wasn't as rich as my homemade version. But the egg was poached to perfection and the English muffin had the most badass toasting--like it was brushed with butter and cooked on a griddle. Nothing is worse than an improperly cooked muffin when it comes to an egg benny. Not toasted enough makes it soggy, too toasted makes it hard as a rock. Speaking of butter, I'm not sure if I tasted this right, but it didn't seem like real butter to me, but more like a butter-flavored margarine. A small detail, I know, but I love real, salted butter when it comes to my breakfast dishes. 

Service-wise we were greeted with smiles, quick service and even though it was hectic, the staff handled the rush like a well oiled machine. The gal who served us was attentive but not overbearing. And, on a personal note, she was wearing a Darth Vader shirt and eating one of my favorite guilty pleasure snacks: saltines with American cheese! HA! I was a big fan. 

Overall, I can't wait to come back and try some more of their menu. Maybe for lunch or dinner next time!"}
{"text":"During my first visit I probably would have given two or three stars.  Nothing terrible happened but the service was pretty lackluster and the Mac and Cheese \"dinner\" was literally a giant bowl of decent (albeit standard) macaroni with creamy cheddar sauce.

Having been back several times since that initial visit I have found that the service during my initial visit must have been an exception and that I simply need to order other items.  I do love mac and cheese, but here it is better ordered as a side.  I also appreciate that The Diner on Clifton is open late and serves part of their breakfast menu all day -- which is a big plus for a breakfast for lunch or dinner guy like me.  I am also a fan of their shakes and will certainly continue visiting, especially if I have a need for a late night snack in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and had the breakfast burrito. It was super tasty. The eggs and sausage were cooked perfectly. The scallions were a nice touch. I wasn't too much of a fan of the home fries. The texture seemed fine, but I didn't think they were very flavorful. I also spent quite some time ogling their dessert case but will alas have unrequited dessert desires until next time."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with fantastic service 
Our waitress even knew directions to the nearest skatepark"}
{"text":"I love it here! It is such a cute, fun, and clean little diner! The food is eclectic and freshly made, and the servers are always friendly. 

I have yet to have anything bad here. In all honesty this has to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast or lunch. 

The eggs benedict is f***ing jizzworthy. Seriously, you could put hollandaise sauce on just about anything and I would go ape s*** over it, but this is arguably the best breakfast item they have. I also love the wrap thingy with chorizo and eggs. YUM!"}
{"text":"Keeps me coming back for more!

I've been coming to this place for years.  Its a diner that doesn't feel like a scuzzy diner.  I love the breakfast burrito.  I get it more often that not.  The coffee isn't on the strong side but good for a lazy late breakfast Sunday.  Service is quick and I've never had anything messed up- even with the hand written tickets.  Its a nice local spot to take out of town guests for a late breakfast/ early lunch since its consistent and pretty much a no fail.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Quick service and great food. Stopped in for both breakfast and lunch. Recommend the breakfast burrito. Large quantity of food at a great price. Music fits the atmosphere and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. After living around the corner from it for two years, my opinion has definitely gotten my positive. 

It can be hard to find parking, but they do have a small lot behind the building. 

Whatever you do - YOU MUST TRY THE GARDEN VEGETABLE SOUP. I promise you will not be disappointed. It is amazing. It's like creamy tomato meets your standard vegetable soup. The veggies and potatoes are always fall-apart-in-your-mouth delicious. 

They offer breakfast all day and have a variety of other food. The deluxe turkey club is awesome (pair it with the soup!)

This place is a must try in Lakewood/Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love love love the food. Excellent salads, best Shepard's pie ever, sweet potato fires - to die for! Why not 5 stars? Two reasons: staff that discriminates against solitary female customers ( looks like you either have to be a man or to be with a man to get a booth by the window) and bathroom that has that awful saturated with carcinogens air of the busy highway. So bring a date and pee at the CVS pharmacy across the street prior to visit."}
{"text":"Classic diner fare... Four Five of us for breakfast and we left full and happy. Pricing was good and waitress was great. For five stars, should be a bit cleaner. It wasn't bad now... But five stars is perfect."}
{"text":"Sept. 2015 Update: I don't know what's changed, but the quality of the food has been spotty lately.  Also, they no longer keep to their restaurants hours.  I've called *at least* 45 minutes before closing and have been told they're already closed for CARRY OUR ORDERS!  When I've asked if I can even get a bowl of soup to go, they've said, \"Everything's already in the refrigerator.\"  Bogus!  The appeal of this place is the quality late night and early morning food.

*****

Consistently great food. I order take out here regularly, so have had a lot of the menu. It's always delicious, has never taken more than 15 minutes, and the service is great. It's typically not the kind of place where you have to check your order before leaving.

I recommend any of the soups, sandwiches, or pasta. They have a decent vegetarian selection and always have garden vegetable cheddar soup (delicious!) and vegetarian chili. Breakfast items are outstanding - great French toast. The few times I've tried dessert here it's been cake, and was always fresh and a huge portion.

The prices are very reasonable for sandwiches and sides, and it seems like all the larger entrees ($9+ our so) include sides, along with soup or salad. Definitely a good deal.

The place isn't huge and does get busy if you want to eat in, but I've never had to wait excessively long. And I don't think a wait at a restaurant is really something to complain about - it's not the restaurant's fault for being popular!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food, and great atmosphere, what more could you want?!?!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service at this cozy little diner minutes from downtown Cleveland.

My husband always takes me here when we visit his hometown, and we're never disappointed. Breakfast is always made quickly and the pancakes rule. The deserts are always tasty too.

If you're near Lakewood and want a good pancake, look no further than this place!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service was as well. If you want air conditioning during the summer, don't go here b/c it's pretty warm. All-in-all a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE RE OPEN!

Staff and service  has always been great along with the food.
Grecian chicken pita or salad will always be my favorite.

I miss my breakfast spot. Always fresh tasty food. 
Mac and cheese always amazing."}
{"text":"We found this place while we were driving to a Bob Evans. I'm so glad we stopped in!!! These are the kind of breakfast joints I cherish. Very intimate with really great food. I had the Eggs Benedict, guess why... Portions were generous and the home fries were done perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot in Lakewood. The place is always packed and you can see why. The food is excellent and the prices aren't bad at all. I enjoyed the veggie omelette and was able to bring some leftovers home which I was excited about! There weren't any tables open when we got there but we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated. Just an FYI, there isn't anywhere to wait so you're kind of crammed at the front door which is awkward when people are sitting at tables right by the door.

Our waitress was good but it seemed like she had too many tables to handle and didn't come around to take our order for a long time. She was running around working her butt off. That was the only thing that was lacking. Otherwise, everything was great and everyone loved what they ordered. I can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Cute, quick and pretty affordable, the Diner on Clifton is ok by me. The breakfasts are classic and simple--eggs, toast and your choice of meat for around $5-$6. The lunches are pretty good as well. The portobello sandwich is lovely, and try the sweet potato fries. Plus, the decor is adorable. Love the retro feel and great people-watching opportunities. Definitely a nice place."}
{"text":"Such a cute little joint...the staff was fast & friendly. The food was Delish!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I try anywhere else for breakfast... Always the best and a good value!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little diner in an area where young professionals may live? That is just a guess as I came with some friends who lived in the area previously. 

We came for brunch and it was pretty busy. We were a party of four and had to wait at least 20 minutes for an available table. This is a small place with bar style seating for individual diners, booths that could seat four but was used by two sometimes, and table and chair seating. There was also one couple eating outside.

The menu items were pretty standard and everything we had was good. I had a salad and fries. A weird combination but that is what I felt like after running 26.2."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! A real treat! Be ready to wait for both your table and service as they are busy--the waitstaff is ok--not overly friendly, but not rude. The food is spectacular. Try the pita chips, and don't forget the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Cute little diner. Interesting look. Wait staff was super friendly. Cheap. Tasty.  Quick. I ordered the bacon and cheese omelette and it was delish. Plenty of food, as it came with home fries and toast. It was a struggle to finish it all. You will definitely leave here full and happy."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times for breakfast, and the food has always been pretty good. I usually order the basics- pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, etc. but they always hit the spot. I have not been here for lunch or dinner, but I've heard good things.

The service can definitely be less than desirable. I think one time I waited about 10 minutes just for a server to aknowledge us and then another 7 minutes just to get some coffee. I understand Saturday mornings can be busy, but they should hire some more servers to compensate. Once we were served, our server was very nice.

The prices of everything is very reasonable. I love getting out of a meal for under $20 for 2 people.

This diner is within walking distance, so that is why I have gone here multiple times. If probably not go here as much if I had to drive."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast performance!

While visiting from out of town we let Yelp guide our way here. 

Our trust was not misplaced. The menu was standard fare with few surprises. 

They EXCELL however in courteous and prompt service, and food that is well portioned and perfectly cooked.  We had French toast on French bread , bacon (super savory), and corned beef hash. 

The crowning gem to this place is the pricing. Definitely in the inexpensive category which belies the quality of the food. 

Ample parking behind the building as well."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great prices and delicious food. Super fast and friendly!! :) sweet potato fries and portabella mushroom wrap for the win!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good gem in the wall, unprepossessing from the outside, homey classic diner on the inside, would definitely recommend it for some comforting yet classy food. Comes on real plates and you can get some former thing. I recommend the fontina ravioli."}
{"text":"A great meal together. We stopped in \"The Diner\" and had great salads - I had the chicken BBQ and my spouse had the Ahi Tuna. They were great - fresh and flavorful.  It was a little hard to focus with the big display unit of desserts staring at us, but we managed. Kids had an enormous hot dog and some of the best mac and cheese.  Comfortable, friendly and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood spot. I stopped here this morning in my post-night shift zombie mode (where I try to stay up as late as possible to get back to normal mode). 

Tuesday morning around 9 so it was not busy at all - walked right in and sat at the counter. The two guys working there were really attentive and friendly. They kept my coffee cup full and didn't care that I sat there for an hour doing a crossword puzzle (try not to judge me, I love the NYT Sunday Crossword!) The restaurant was clean and had chill music playing. Perfect for the mood I was in.

The food came out very quickly and was all really good. The eggs were super-fresh and yummy. Regular diner fare, nothing really outside the box, but what they do, they do very well. What more can you ask for, really?"}
{"text":"Pretty much my go to breakfast spot in Lakewood. Quick, easy, clean, basic, good diner food. 

I've only had breakfast here but every time service was efficient and food was good and generous. I liked the regular breakfasts and omelettes. Had the Benedict once but it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The last two Saturdays I have stopped at The Diner on Clifton and got something I never had here before: a burger. And, folks, I'm shocked to be saying this, but it was the best burger I've ever had in Cleveland. Yes, better than Five Guys (easy), Brown Bag (easy), Swenson's (not even close), Heck's (pretty easy), Whitey's (not even close), Bearden's (you jest), and, finally, B Spot (please don't tell Michael). Yes, I have blasphemed. So sue me. No, haven't tried the burger at Little Bar yet but will. 

It was SO good last week that I had to try it again today, and it was not a fluke. It's big, it's juicy, it's dressed to perfection, and it reminds me of why I fell in love with great burgers back when Manners was doing it right. Or at least my youthful taste buds thought they were.

If you love a good burger and never tried one at The Diner, treat yourself and give it a go. I'm betting your first one won't be your last. 

Just one more reason The Diner is one of my favorite casual spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place makes a killer tuna sandwich bomb Its made out of tuna steak you just don't no bomb diggity! I had the Mac and cheese also good to go. And you can order out!"}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast/brunch on the weekend?  This place is the bomb.  Everything is good but you cant go wrong with the breakfast burrito or eggs benedict.  Coffee is OK...not the best."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot on the west side. I'm a huge fan of omelettes, bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice and The Diner delivers on all three. I love that breakfast is served all day, prices are reasonable, and takeout service is superb. The veggie omelette has all fresh veggies (no canned mushrooms) and is so good I could eat it everyday. Oh and did I mention the bacon is amazing? Seriously, try it."}
{"text":"I used to visit this place with relative frequency years ago, and just sort of fell out of the habit.  Recently, I've been back twice for lunch and I have really enjoyed it.  The retro(-ish) decor is a nice update from the Diner I remember, and the selections I've had off the menu have been good to great.  I'm a sucker for Mac N' Cheese and theirs is no slouch.  The fries have been top notch as well.  My favorites so far are the Gorgonzola Burger and Heather's Wrap.  The latter stuffs a turkey sandwich and potato salad into a Chipotle Burrito sized wrap.  I'm fortunate that it's too big for my GF to eat at one sitting, as I get to devour the remaining half. 
Prices are reasonable, and the service has been solid.  If you haven't been, or haven't been in a while, make it a point to visit."}
{"text":"I could eat at Diner on Clifton every day of the week and never get tired of it, because not only is there a ton of variety on the menu, there are many dishes that I order over and over and over again because they're so great. So by the time I got tired of ordering one dish, there would be a plethora of others to become addicted to. 

Lately, I have been loving the vegetarian pasta bake. I love that the creamy goat cheese in the pasta is sort of dropped into the dish in dollops rather than mixed right into the sauce, which I think would overpower the tomato sauce. 

The honey-balsamic dressing is out of this world!

While the food is wonderful, and the servers are generally friendly, it can be hit or miss on certain things. 

First, I don't love the parking situation, because to me, the back parking lot is the ONLY option, so if there are no spots, I'm either going to wait or I'm going somewhere else. 

Also, the desserts (not made in-house) are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they're unbelievably awesome, others....not so much. The last time I was there, I shared the lemon cake with my friend and it was not good... Very dry and bland. 

The service can also be kind of inconsistent. The last time I was there, our waitress pretty much ignored us after taking our orders and bringing them. Granted, we were there for a long time after we were done eating, but we never had water or iced tea refills (not even during our meal, much less when we were just sitting and chatting). When she did stop by, it was just to wordlessly lean over us and grab our table's ketchup and sugar to start closing up for the night. Blah...."}
{"text":"My Mom wanted me to come to meet her for dinner the other week. I had the Greek Wrap which was great. Mom had the pulled pork sandwich. Everything we had here was good. It is a nice diner atmosphere. Almost as good as Steven Seagal in Out for Justice, or his new show, Lawman!"}
{"text":"The place is amazing.  We have eaten here several times since we moved here last month.  The staff is very friendly too.  TRY THIS ONE OUT."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions on this place, I want to really like it but it's just not there. It's never really clean when you get your table, it can be slow and I still end up waiting forever and there is absolutely no consistency in the quality and taste of the food. 

I've been for breakfast, Greek Omelette was ok, I will admit. No complaints here, besides it was kinda cold by the time I got it. Coffee isn't too tasty either. Exploring the lunch menu, the fries were soggy, tuna was runny and disgusting, Mac and cheese was tasteless. Dinner time, me my Mom and Brother went. I got the Hummus wrap w/chicken and it just looked poor, very bad presentation. It fell apart before I got a chance to bite into it, my Mom got a pot-pie that taste like flour, very poor. My Brother isn't too hard to please he had the White Trash Burger and it was what you'd expect. Grease with a little bit of bread, bacon and meat. He loved it. 

Their location is so good, customer service isn't too hot, they act as if they could care less you're there. At least pretend, so I can feel semi-ok about tipping you. It's all here to have a great place. Location, location, location. Get it together!"}
{"text":"We only come here when we try to change it up after going to Grey Dog & Coffee Pot every weekend.  I don't know why we do it. 
It's always so-so. 

We end up with the short-dark-haired middle-aged lady every time, much to our dismay. She's not totally rude, but she's certainly not nice. Always annoyed when we ask for the salt & pepper missing from our table or if we can have the water we asked for 3 times. 

The food's basic. Flavorless. Their home fries are just half-mashed potatoes. 

They do have orange juice that tastes like oranges though. And their sauce bottles are clean (almost unheard of at a diner). 

There's just nothing particularly good or special at this place and I hate being served by someone who makes me feel like a burden."}
{"text":"Helped a friend move this past Sunday, and when it came time to eat, my only requirement was, \"We can't go someplace with a TV, because I am DVR'ing the Browns game and I don't want to know what happens.\" Hence, we headed here.

This place is sorta like the west side's version of The Inn on Coventry--the cuisine isn't anything eye-poppingly original, but the food that they do serve is simple, solid, generously-sized, and delicious. My burger was delicious, and reasonably priced too. (Caveat: if you're like me and you like your beef served to you with the shade of red found on the Buckeyes' helmets, make sure to specifically ask for \"less than medium rare\"--I ordered mine \"medium rare\", and unfortunately there wasn't much pink in the center.)

I was really impressed with our servers--we received constant refills and they constantly checked up on us to make sure we were OK. I got at least 2 refills of Diet Coke and Sheila F. received several refills of coffee. This is a nice departure from other places that will leave your cup bone dry for quite some time!

I would definitely eat here again if I was in that part of town. It's hard to beat Grumpy's Cafe up the street if I'm looking for brunch, but those in he Clifton\West 117th neighborhood would do well to come here if they're looking for a local brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for some delicious brunch after working night shift one morning. The food was good! I got the vegetable omelet and some fries (along with the home fries... yes I was HUNGRY and in the mood for some comfort food). Everything was delicious! I love Diners, so I loved the atmosphere. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some big portions and some (greasy) comfort food. Our waitress was not the most pleasant, but she came around towards the end (I guess when she realized we were getting close to leaving our tips....) I would definitely go back for the food.... but the bigger factor drawing me back is the display case filled with SCRUMPTIOUS looking cakes that I was too full to try!!"}
{"text":"Great place I always come here for breakfast and everything's always great . They have freshly squeezed orange juice which is soooo good! Service is always great too !"}
{"text":"I was happy to be able to visit here during my recent trip \"home\".  I love this diner, lots of fun memories!  The food is really good and you have lots of eclectic options depending on what you are interested in.  It fits right into its location in the heart of Lakewood!"}
