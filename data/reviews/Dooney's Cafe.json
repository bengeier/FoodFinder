{"text":"Dooneys Cafe at Ossington and Bloor is the place to be. Stop in for a delicious breakfast. The Standard is a huge portion at a great price if you want a nice breakfast/brunch. I love the Charcuterie Platter for dinner, so many options and generous portion. They have a brussel sprout app and a beet and goat cheese salad that is amazing. If you want steak, the striploin will satisfy you everytime. (My husbands fave!). Great selection of beer, wine and specialty drinks. You won't go wrong at this gem of a place!  Graziano makes a mean Americano if you want to just stop in for a caffeine fix. Kudos to the chef and the hosts are super nice!! Dooneys is the place to go. The ambiance is lovely. Can't wait for the patio to open!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Dooney's except for the lack of care of the server.  Food was good and at a reasonable price.  But server was pretty absent and showed no interest in our satisfaction. A disappointment in that way.   Perhaps due to busy-ness of restaurant at the time.   But still.  No apologies.  No nothing. No asking how we liked our meals.  No offers of more coffee.  I am willing to give Dooney's another try and hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"I have been by several times since Dooney's opened. The coffee has been solid, as had the food. The standout here is the service, however. The baristas, servers, and the manager have all been wonderful. As well, they were extremely careful to prepare a meal that was safe for someone with a gluten allergy. Welcome to the neighbourhood, Dooney's!"}
{"text":"The food, the setting, the coffee/espresso.. everything is great. Perhaps most importantly, the people are very awesome (this is a big one).  I'm very happy Dooney's moved into my neighbourhood. I've been here for brunch, drinks/wine at night and I've loved it every single time."}
{"text":"Meh.  Had brunch there on holiday Monday. The place was half full and it took over forty minutes for three all day breakfasts to come out. The food was mediocre (cold toast, bland potatoes), but at least not too expensive ($8 for eggs, meat, and potatoes).  With so much competition in the area, I won't be heading back."}
{"text":"Dooney's is my favourite cafe in the area, by far. I stop in almost every day, be it for food or just a coffee and I am not the only one. They have built up such a crowd of regulars of all ages that there are always familiar faces sitting around the restaurant. The food is great but the atmosphere is the best part. It's very laid back and comfortable. The staff are awesome (Rebecca, Liam, Selina!!! The best!) I don't understand the lower reviews here. Trust me, give this place a try if you're looking for a new spot."}
{"text":"Finally checked out their brunch this Saturday afternoon, and despite the nicely done contemporary décor, we were not that impressed. Service was prompt, and our food didn't take long to come out. However, food was below average. Eggs Florentine was just OK, could have used some more flavour. Ouvo Calabrese wasn't that great either. It was basically just 2 poached eggs with tomato sauce, canned beans, and a few slices of baguette. It came piping hot in a cast iron pan, and had a thin, runny consistency. Again, needs more flavour. Coffee was also not that good. I just got a cup of your standard drip, and it had a bitter and unpleasant taste. Maybe their espresso is better, but I most likely will not be back to find out.  I wish the food had been more flavourful and had more oomph to it because this place has great potential to be a local gem! The décor is very nice, great natural lighting shining through the windows, and a cool looking bar. I wish it had lived up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Quiet lunch spot with a delicious burger. Normally get with with half fries half salad. Brunch is also wonderful. Just wish they were open earlier on weekends."}
{"text":"I admit it, I spent a lot of time at the old Dooney's in the Annex in the 90s. Now, it's followed me a couple of subway stops west, and I couldn't be happier. After a couple of visits - one dinner and one lunch - I can only say that it's the kind of place the neighbourhood has needed for a long time. Not a hipster bar, not a plastic-table-cloth ethnic joint (nothing wrong with those, but there are plenty of each in the neighbourhood), but a place where you can stop for a beer or a glass of wine and a snack after work, have a grown-up dinner without breaking the bank, or while away the afternoon.  The dinner menu is heavy on seafood, with a Portuguese influence: excellent sardines, octopus, smelts. Virtually everything we had, I'd order again. Lunch - the burger is nothing to write home about, and I'd like to see more pasta options, but the sandwich and salad were great. And when I asked for mayo with my fries, they didn't say they'd run out, the kitchen made some. That's service from front and back of house.  Very happy to have Dooney's back."}
{"text":"Checked this place out Sunday when we were on Bloor West and Terrazza was opening late, not leaving us enough time to get to our show at Comedy Bar for 7pm.  The service was excellent. The server was very knowledgeable, and made excellent recommendations. Everything is homemade here, from scratch.   We both had the 5oz strip loin steak, medium rare. The starch was a potato gallette, which was excellent, and the vegetable was pan fried rapini and brussel sprouts.  The serving size was perfect and the presentation was fantastic.  Looking forward to going back here soon."}
{"text":"Great location & service, very friendly staff, but sub-par food.  Eggs Florentine: the eggs were nice and runny but the hollandaise sauce was bland and gelatinous; the spinach was brown and very unappealing.  The Steak & Eggs: the \"steak\" was a ragged fatty slice of overdone beef (despite being ordered med-rare); the eggs were done well.  The fried potatoes that came with all our meals looked burned on the outside but were soggy all the way through.  Bleh.  Definitely would not come here from brunch again.  Maybe for a drink or to try the bar bites, but definitely not for brunch."}
{"text":"Came by for a pint while waiting for a restaurant to open up for dinner service.  I got a stout and my friend got an IPA (sorry, I forgot the names). They have limited selection of beers on tap and our bill came up to almost $20 not including tips (pricey no!?)  Nothing special here. Lots of students studying inside."}
{"text":"We were here for weekend bunch a few times. We went today for lunch ,what a disappointment. The new menu was much smaller and the service was non existent . The waiter ess who seemed new or just didn' t care left tables waiting while she chatted up the only young single man in there. Are you there to work or hunt for your next ; whatever. I just wanted some service ,like a beer or food or what's the special of the day is! Not today , just her back to the few tables waving for her attention while she talk on & on to this guy who had eaten (lucky guy) as the rest of the US stared at her big button.  Bad food can kill a place , but bad service unchecked can drive a place under. So avoid here during lunch  or be prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a few Sundays ago. We shared the Eggs Benedict and it was tasty."}
{"text":"I'm overjoyed to have found Dooney's after all these years! It was our fave back in its Annex days, so its \"rediscovery\" was fabulous. Brunching on the sunny patio, sipping their excellent coffee - life is good. Dooney's club sandwich is superb, with tasty home fries. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awful.  This was the first I haven't left a tip, EVER.  We sat down and there were 5 tables of people.  The person behind the bar didn't even glance up at us, and it took 15 minutes for the waitress to come over.  At this point we'd gotten our own menus and when she asked if we needed a few mintues, we ordered bacon and eggs immediately.  We told her we were in a big rush, and she said the kitchen wasn't busy and it would take 5-7 minutes since it's just bacon and eggs.  20 minutes later we asked if it was almost ready, and she said it's just coming out.  25 minutes later, we were ready to leave and get mcdonalds or something, and she brought over our food, which was cold.  In the time between when we walked in and got our food, no new customers had come in.  How was it possible that our food was cold when we waited 45 minutes and there was no other food being made?  I have no idea.  There were a bunch of other issues too, like she didn't wipe our table, and we had to ask for cutlery after she brought our food over, and things like butter on the toast.  The food was awful.  We'll never go back.  It's too bad, because the the place LOOKS really nice."}
{"text":"I like the new Dooney's, actually. I went on Sunday for coffee because the other cafe in the area was completely full. There are places that sometimes don't allow you in at brunch time if you're not eating, and they were totally fine with allowing me to have my own table for just coffee. Good music, too.  I like it there. It's an easy going vibe, not pretentious at all, and though I haven't eaten at the new location, the plates of all the brunch-goers nearby looked full and yummy.  The coffee that I had - Americano then a latte - were excellent."}
{"text":"After visiting the (excellent) walk in clinic across the road, my boyfriend and I came here for brunch in the Christie Pitts area.  The service was extremely slow. The food was bland. I had a salad, my boyfriend had minestrone soup and a sandwich. We didn't bother taking it with us, it didn't taste good. Neither of us finished what we ordred.  The only thing we liked was the soup.  We waited probably 45 minutes for our food to arrive, this was on a Tuesday. Pretty disappointing and not worth my time."}
{"text":"My first time there, I loved the ambiance, the warmth, my breakfast sandwich was absolutely delicious.I was pleasantly surprised to find some raspberry jam in the sandwich that was perfectly balanced by the prosciutto, kale and bright yellow eggs... I will be back for sure for dinner once dinner is back, in about 3 weeks..."}
{"text":"Just had one of the burger today and it was really good... biiiig and juicy with great bread and nice chunk of cheese, came with fries (u can get salad instead)..  will be going back.  (wish I took a picture before I ate it.)  nice service, nice place."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome. They have a great selection of beers. The atmosphere is very laid back, but the service is very prompt. You get the feel that this place is a neighbourhood gem. It's a great escape from busy Bloor Street."}
{"text":"Is it a Cafe? Is it a bar? It's neither.... The one thing it does have is all the makings of mediocrity. Mediocre menu, mixed up orders, dark Atmosphere, cold drafts in winter, average service... It doesn't do anything dead wrong, but doesn't do anything right either. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and was pleasantly surprised on both occasions. For me, it's more of a lunch/hangout kind of place than a bar. I find the prices are really reasonable and the food quality is very good. I've never seen it too crowded, so it's easy to find a table and you don't feel rushed. Servers are friendly.   For brunch they have your typical dishes plus some sandwiches. I had a roasted veggie and cheese sandwich which was very satisfying. At dinner, they have small plates to share. Get the brussel sprouts - so well done and crispy with shaved parmesan, mmm!! I also loved their gnudi which were perfectly fluffy as they should be.   This is my go-to spot for a casual bite in the Bloor-Ossington area."}
{"text":"Came back for the first time on a while after previously having bad service. Was given a not completely full pint. The foam stopped a good half inch from the top of the glass. If you can't pour a pint, I just don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here and we ordered the brussel sprouts to start and fish and chips for the main. The food was delicious and our waitress was awesome, the only complaint I would have is how long we waited for the fish and chips - we assume it is because they only have one deep fryer. Regardless, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by the breakfast. We stopped in got a table on the extra large patio, super fast service for a weekend brunch.   The waiter was AWESOME!   I ordered the mushroom omelette.... It had a sliced portobello in it !! Most places use canned except for the high end restaurants.   My GF's order had REAL... Potatoes. Not the reconstituted simulated things most places have.   Still in shock for so much great food for a great price and no line ups....."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio y rápido, el lugar es muy acogedor, aunque pequeño, la comida muy rica,  tradicional y abundante, el chocolate caliente delicioso!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch and I have really enjoyed it. The wait staff are attentive and the food quick to arrive. Also, the patio is lovely and the coffee is delicious. Both of those are so important to me in a brunch joint."}
