{"text":"All the restaurants up this way have closed down...the food was fair and the prices were way too high...they have switched to Crooked River BBQ...Their grand opening was October 22nd...  We ate there a week later on Halloween...Saturday night...got chicken that looked undercooked...got ribs that were ok, not awesome...ordered garlic mashed potatoes, they were out of them...during grand opening...hmmmm...so got hush puppies...not good...and Cole slaw...no flavor what so ever...the Rib sauces were good, but the hot bbq sauce was not hot at all...  For a grand opening, we were let down"}
{"text":"Was it possible to give half a star instead? I like that they have Cheer wine and the girl at the register was friendly. That is the extent of nice comments for this place. The kitchen staff was rude and talked more to each other about the customers than any of the people in the dining room spoke to each other. It is most decidedly not authentic Carolina barbecue, but we could look past that if the staff was as friendly as they are in the South. They are not. The brisket was chewy, the pulled pork was dry. The ribs were average at best. The sides left much to be desired- mac n cheese was gritty, apple sauce was funky. All the sauces taste generic. A bit of southern hospitality and salt need to be injected into this place..."}
{"text":"We got take out, we both got the Carolina combo which comes with ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were good, could have been a bit more moist but had a good flavorful crust. The pulled pork was great-very tender with a nice smokey flavor. The hush puppies were some of the best I'd ever had. The baked beans and fries were good. Will probably try different sides next time though. We tried the original sweet sauce and the mustard sauce. Both were good. The employees were all very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ol Carolina LOVE their \"Southern Pride,\" but if you're a Northern Yank.. then you'd better hide.   Worst BBQ I have ever had, Period.  I could stop there, because that does accurately sum up our experience. But, this is a review eh? I can explain why..  Dry meats.  We tried ALL of them. All DRY, all day.  Ok, well.. maybe they have a few original sauces we can drown this jerky down with, right?  Nah.  Sub-Standard Sauces.  Ever been to Arbys? (I know you have!) Remember those mouth-wash style miniature cup-cake baking thimbles they give you for pumping a pinky worth of sauce for?  Yep, me too. I guess these guys were feeling nostalgic, or just gave up. Probably the latter..  Luke warm sides.   We carried ours back to the counter, since no one asked actually asked us how we were doing, and the counter-top teenaged dame said, \"I'm so sorry, but we thank you so much!\"   (Classic southern swine speak.)  Bleh.  They did actually bring our sides back to us at.. The.Exact.Same.Temp. we sent them away at.  Anyways..  If you desire sub-par bbq, after shopping in a sub-par strip plaza, then this place is for you!  NOTE: (There IS a HomeTown Buffet within walking distance!) Don't 'splurge' on this pretend BBQ joint.. just go fill your face next door! Or at Arbys.  Anyways, If you DO know true-BBQ, then this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Dry and over cooked ribs that you have to dip in separate cup of sauce for any flavor."}
{"text":"This is definitely not a 5 star but if I want barbeque this is where I will be. PROS: Variety of sauces Generous portions Good value- 2 mains 3 sides 2 beers 20 bucks Friendly staff Clean   CONS:  Restaurant set up can lend itself to longer waits (think chipotle lines) Feeling fat and sassy afterwards"}
{"text":"Not enough praise that I can put in this review. I love this place and the staff is awesome. I think the BBQ we get here is even better than what we get in North Carolina. I got a full slab of ribs this time and they were superb! The only negative was they were out of cans of Cheerwine but they let me purchase a half gallon of it from the fountain!! Will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this BBQ place because I heard good thing, turns out it not good at all. We ordered half a chicken and a 2 meat plate went and sat down and egerly waited. The food got to the table quickly but some how half chicken turned into three legs, so I asked the waitress how went to talk to the kitchen staff and I could hear the cooks yelling to her that they had no half chicken left and that was what we were getting. So we decided to just eat because we were hungry, the chicken was dry and tough, the brisket so dry it crumbled a part.  Pull pork was the only thing semi edible.   The manager later came out and apologized and gave us a voucher for a free half chicken but I unfortunately I will not even be going back for that!!"}
{"text":"I should say that barbeque isn't something I usually go out of my way for. But I'm ALWAYS willing to be convinced. And Old Carolina certainly didn't convince my husband and I. Numerous issues can be raised... from terrible customer service... to weird setup of the restaurant itself. And of course the food that was simply \"meh\". We paid $24.94 for a brisket sandwich and Brunswick stew for me and a pulled pork with coleslaw sandwich and mac and cheese for my hubby. The sandwiches come with NOTHING else on them which we didn't know. And there are a handful of condiments you can add yourself, but we didn't see them and weren't told. We DID find the barbeque sauces though... none of which really tasted like anything beyond what we could get at Giant Eagle. So while both of our sandwiches weren't bad... they certainly weren't good. The buns are clearly generic and couldn't stand up to the sandwiches. my Brunswick stew was NOT Brunswick stew... it was are cup with mashed tomatoes and corn and pulled chicken with no liquid... and it had no real flavor beyond tomato. My hubby says his mac and cheese was more or less Velveeta on flavor and texture. Processed and nothing special. All in all I feel like we overpaid. Especially considering the HORRIBLE customer service. There was only 2 other couples in the WHOLE dining room... take a second to say Hello and smile. We don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"We ended up at OCBC due to the false pretenses of $.58 chicken sandwiches at Chic-fil-a.  It's a long story but henceforth I shall not trust any Twitter posts or my 14 year old daughter .  That's all I have to say about that. But enough about me...    Let's break it down:  1) Atmosphere - Wide open spaces with casual d√©cor.  Nice high ceilings open the place up and make you feel like you have a lot of elbow and sticky fingers room.  Plenty and variable seating options (high tables, benches, lower tables).  Also, there's an industrial sized glass garage door that will open up to the sidewalk during the rare occasion of nice weather in NEO.  I especially liked the nice touch of metal pipe (fastened to the table) paper towel dispenser.  The ordering line is delineated by a short wooden wall bordering your right with a full height wall on your left.  The main menu is mounted on the wall and it's totally IN YOUR FACE.  I had to lean backwards over the short wall to read the thing.  Where's OSHA when you need them.  Overall, I totally dug the vibe though!  2) Service - you order at the counter and the staff was very attentive and fast.  They even showed patience when I was visually struggling with the massive (dimensions) menu two inches from my face (or so it seemed).  The order was taken accurately and we were awarded an order number to place at our table for delivery.  We filled our self-serve drinks and collected our utensils, condiments and sauces at the designated area, which had middle school cafeteria floor stickiness to it.  Once we seated ourselves, it was only a matter of few minutes before our food arrived via a friendly staff member.  Once we scarfed our mass quantities we were informed the table will be bussed/bused (cleaned off) for us.     3) Food - I love BBQ. I'm not an expert or a warrior of the Texas vs. Carolina  vs. St. Louis wars.  I just love goo gobs of meat saturated in tangy sauces.  My apologies (or rather sympathies) to my vegan friends...  I ordered the brisket sandwich special which includes a side (baked beans in my case).  Its goo gobs I wanted, its goo gobs I got.  My sandwich was piled high with 1/4 sliced, succulent, tender strips with a very nice smoke ring.  I slathered on various sauces and was lost to the World for 15 minutes.  I came up for air and ate some of the delicious and somewhat spicy baked beans.  I had chosen wisely.  After my food coma I was told by everyone they very much enjoyed their food as well.   4) Value - Since I usually feed 5 people at a time and given the comfortable atmosphere, enthusiastic service, excellent food quality I give it a thumps up!  4 people gorged themselves for a total of $38...not bad!"}
{"text":"We went in with our almost four year old daughter. She had a great meal. She found out she loves bbq chicken. The best thing is that they give you the sauce on the side and they have multiples. Definitely will go back too !"}
{"text":"I have been to BBQ restaurants in the Georgia, Texas, and other places in the south and southwest. Old Carolina sits among the top places I have been to. Locally, in Mentor, it is the best and is the place we go to for our BBQ when I am lazy and don't want to smoke my own brisket or pork.   The staff has always been friendly and we never had negative issues with them. The menu selections are diverse and you can mix and match your meats and sides.  Initially, looking at the menu and the meal costs you think the food is expensive. Upon receiving you food (delivered to your table) you see the portions are huge. You will not leave hungry. The fries are fresh cut  and piled high on the platter. I am never big on restaurant Mac & Cheese as it is usually bland and noodles are over cooked. old Carolina does a perfect job and I usually order this as one of my sides.   As with any place there will be times when there is a bad meal or a reviewer with an attitude because they have super high expectations. With that said, you should give Old Carolina a shot."}
{"text":"Ehh, pretty good. I've eaten a lot on bbq in my days and this was just ok. Had the two meat platter with pulled pork and pulled chicken. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the lady cooking behind the counter was also eating behind the counter as well."}
{"text":"Reopened under the name Crooked River BBQ, but nothing improved. Same owner, same everything except the franchise license."}
{"text":"Ok the staff was awesome, but I was disappointed!!  Growing up in NC I know Carolina BBQ and this is not at all CAROLINA.  BBQ was very dry!!  Fries were greasy and undercooked. And slaw was just disgusting.  Go on down the road!!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost.. bbq is the one meal that everyone has their own distinct preference on.  I like vinegar based bbq.  My wife likes sweet based bbq.  That being said... for a chain bbq joint.. this place offers a great in between.  Inside was literally immaculate.  I don't know if it could be cleaner honestly.  Menu was super easy to understand.  Staff was super friendly and checked on us twice while we were seated to see if we needed anything (keep in mind this an order and pick up at the counter restaurant).   The food was juicy.. appropriately smoked for us (we aren't crazy about the super smoked foods)... and the portions were great.  Both me and my wife had enough of our pulled chicken and pork to have an extra sandwich.  Mashed potatoes were freshly mashed and tasty.. fries were freshly cut and tasty as well.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars from us is solely based on the limited sauce choices.  Don't want to hurt anyone's  feelings but their tomatoe based sauces all tasted the same except for their spicy varient.  The mustard sauce was delicious but it would have been nice to represent the whole state of NC and have a sweet sauce and just a vinegar sauce.    All in all.. great place and great price.  We will return for another round.   Oh.. and offering adult beverages is a nice touch.. maybe just not so expensive? Either way we will come back again soon"}
{"text":"If I could give them less stars I would. I recommend this place if you like over priced dry tasteless food. I should have realized when we walked in and there wasn't even the hint of a delicious BBQ smell.   We tried their mini sandwiches (3 each) . I had pulled chicken, pulled pork, & fried chicken. These all came on overly tasteless and dry white bread buns. Both the chicken and pork where easily drier then the nasty bun.  Yes there are 4 sauces to drowned the tasteless meats in, however those where sub-par at best.  The \"fried\" chicken sandwich was just there fried chicken tenders on a bun with some mayo. It really had no flavor either.   I had the hush puppies and mashed potatoes for sides. The hush puppies where not terrible. That is probably because they had to be made to order. So they where the one thing we ordered that came out hot.  As for the potatoes, not the worst but not the best. And not even warm , room temp at best.   When I took my husbands Mac-n- cheese back to the counter to see if I could get one that was actually hot. The group of teens working rolled their eyes and passed it around as if I was crazy. And when they brought out another dish it was equally as room temp as it was the first time.   I never saw anyone working there who was over the age of 19/20 years old. I think that there are bigger problems then that but it didn't help there cause.   Over all don't waste your time, money , or calories on this garbage food. Eat local and non corporate , you'll get better everything."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout on a Saturday evening. My parents got salads and loved them. I ordered a half slab of ribs. Not impressed by them at all.  I tried all of the sauces they offered. Nothing too exciting. Probably won't go back."}
