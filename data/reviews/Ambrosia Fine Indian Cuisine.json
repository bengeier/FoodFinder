{"text":"After reading these great reviews, i decided to go for a celebratory dinner. Granted it was a thursday night, i didn't want anything fancy. (Brought baby and toddler. We ordered the chili cheese naan, garlic naan, lamb seekh kabobs and chili chicken. The chili cheese naan was fabulous! Everything else was disgusting. I can't believe it came out of the same kitchen. The kabobs were served with purple cabbage and a sweet yellow dessert sauce (maybe caramel.) There were also dots of tamarind chutney. I really don't know who has tamarind chutney with kabobs! There were no charred marks as you'd get from cooking in a tandoor, or even broiling in oven. I'm from toronto, i know hakka cuisine. This was NOT hakka. I'm not sure why my experience was nothing close to the other reviews. Perhaps they had a substitute chef on an off peak night. I asked the waitress if the food is made fresh, she responded, \"sometimes we cook it, sometimes its already made\" :/"}
{"text":"This place is seriously good. I could see myself eating here once a week, or being the place you miss the most when you're away from home. My husband and I ordered the \"dinner for 2\" special for $30 which comes with 6 pakoras to start, then one vegetable and one meat dish (we chose chana masala and butter chicken), a big bowl of basmati rice and a very generous basket of naan. We upgraded to the garlic naan and also enjoyed a pot of chai tea. The \"dinner for 2\" finishes with two servings of gulab jamun and everything was absolutely amazing. It was so flavorful and fresh and the spice was perfection. Our server was so cheery and helpful. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered food today from Ambrosia at office expecting it to be as good as any other take away.   To my surprise it was as better as a fine dining restaurant. The Lamb Rogan gosh was authentic to taste, excellent preparation. The Vegetarian dishes ordered were equally good and authentic to taste. I would say one of the places where you get great value for your dime under the Authentic Indian category...   Keep up the taste guys !"}
{"text":"This place has the best butter chicken I have ever tasted.The garlic naan was great as well as the coconut rice. Not to mention the beef samosas was very tasty as well. I see why all the good reviews."}
{"text":"When my wife and I moved to Lynnwood from Inglewood we were underwhelmed by the dining options, especially East Indian, the only option nearby was, disappointing, to be generous.   Fast forward a few years and we are excited to see that a new Indian restaurant was coming to the neighborhood, we were slightly concerned they were moving into what we called the \"death slot\" in Glenmore Square, it's been a revolving door of restaurants and we don't want this to be another one.  We noticed it had opened and decided to check it out. Walking in it was unfortunately empty and atmosphere wise they had spared every expense, it's very spartan and plain. It was concerning but we didn't let that deter us, we sat down in the empty restaurant and we were served by a very polite gentleman that was knowledgeable about the menu and seemed genuinely excited to be there.  We ordered a veggie pakora starter, butter chicken, spinach paneer entrees, saffron rice and garlic naan. It's pretty much the standard we use to gauge a new restaurant whether we'll be back.  First the pakora, it came out fresh out of the frier, with three chutneys, mango, mint and tamarind. It was crispy on the outside, and creamy and crunchy on the inside, probably the best pakora I've had in Calgary, it was delicious. The chutneys were very good, we both don't like mint chutneys but this one was actually very tasty and the wife especially liked it. My favourite remains the Tamarind but they were all very good.  The butter chicken was fantastic, it had just right amount of heat, the sauce was clearly made special, unlike most homogenous orange sauces, this was slightly more red and tomato-y and, you could see various spices in it. The chicken was so tender it practically melted in your mouth. I made me happy that it wasn't your standard tough and dry chicken breast. This is amongst the best I've had in the city  The spinach paneer was very good, I only had a bite so I can't properly review it but it was more mild than the butter chicken, the spices were bang on though and the paneer was flavourful and not rubbery.  The naan was fantastic, with the perfect mix of crispness and chewy dough, not too thick and not too thin. No complaints about the rice, it was cooked perfectly.  All things considered we're extremely excited to have a top notch East Indian restaurant in the Ogden area and really hope that more people check it out, we want this restaurant to bump the trend in this location.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As the other reviewers said, it's a relief to finally have a good Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood. The prices are reasonable and they have combo deals that rival the Chinese and pizza takeout places in the area, so it's actually a good option for an inexpensive meal unlike most Indian restaurants in Calgary.   The service was great both times we were there, very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. The first time we went, they gave our baby his own little dish of mild butter chicken sauce and the second time they made him a little mango lassi.   We've tried at least eight curry dishes and liked them all. The flavours are great, and the meat is tender. The naan is fresh and hot. A few standouts for me were the coconut beef, the aloo gobi, and the veggie korma, but it was all good. They have these spinach tikki fritter appetizer things with cream cheese in them that were both unexpected and freaking awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Finally... A great and affordable Indian restaurant in Ogden! My boyfriend got us some takeout. For $28.00 we ate our fill and there is enough left over for my my boyfriend's lunch. They were respectful and accommodating regarding my dairy intolerance and helped us choose the dairy-free options. We ordered: garlic naan bread, Roti, coconut rice, prince potatoes and the chicken kashai - all flavourful and delicious! :-) They have value combo options and lunch specials - worth checking out! Good on you Ambrosia Fine Indian Cuisine!  Welcome to the neighbourhood! :-)"}
{"text":"Wow! Best East Indian food I've ever had! And I live in the NE! Fantastic service, very clean. Will be back for sure, maybe weekly! We enjoyed the spinach tikka fritters, garlic Naan, butter chicken, lamb biryani, coconut surprise and chai tea. All amazing and very reasonable prices! A friend of ours is not too adventurous with new foods and said he loved what he tried and would also come back for more! If that isn't a compliment, I don't know what is! lol"}
