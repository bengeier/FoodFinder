{"text":"I have been looking for a good chinese restaurant in the southwest for a while now and finally found one.  We have always gone to chinatown for the best chinese food in vegas (China Mama, HK Star...), but now we can stay local and have great chinese food. Their Hong Kong pan fried noodle and Mongolian Beef is our favorite."}
{"text":"I work nearby and thought I would try it out for lunch. I was very happy with this restaurant. The food was great, fast, and very reasonably priced. The service was friendly and the cook even came out to check on my meal. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awful food.  Ordered Mongolian beef was all onion.. when I called to complain I was told.. sorry thats how we serve it.. waste of $20"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up last night - been wanting to try it - the food was pretty good - they made a mistake on my kung pao chicken - so I called them when I got home  - they actually delivered a whole brand new dish as I originally ordered within 15 minutes - I was very surprised and appreciated their customer service.  I will order again."}
{"text":"Grand sign was my go-to for curry chicken. Loved it extra spicy. Carried out today and it was just way off. Watered down and less chicken then usual. You can see all the chili flakes but wasn't spicy at all. Too bad."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Old school Chinese that is lighter and cleaner than grease pits in China Town. I love this place - give it a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So hard to find non greasy, flavorful Chinese food! This is now a regular spot for me. Really yummy food and not much oil/salt"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different items to go, and 2 of them were wrong when we got home and opened them.  Wrong as in we ordered fried rice, and got chow mein! The other issue was that we ordered Mongolian Beef and we got pork instead!  And yes, we can tell the difference between beef and pork.  So I would avoid any restaurant that either doesn't know the difference between pork and beef, or simply doesn't care what they are serving you!!"}
{"text":"Was searching for Cheeburger Cheeburger and sadly it's out of business, but lucky for us Grand Sign is right next door. Took a chance and was really surprised with how good it was. We had the walnut shrimp, wonton noodle soup, and pan-fried noodles with beef! Ah-mazing. Really delicious! Felt pretty authentic too. Staff very sweet and friendly. Will absolutely go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for lunch and both times were good = consistency! I like the quality of the food and the price is reasonable. It could use a tad more spice, but that is easy enough to do using the chili paste or (if you prefer) soy sauce. But there is no need to add much.  I'll definitely be going back for more lunches."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The lunch size portion is generous & the pork with garlic sauce is so good!!"}
{"text":"Food is good! Pretty authentic Cantonese / Hong Kong cuisine! Staff are friendly. We ordered Garlic deep fried spare ribs (yummy), HK style beef stew egg noodles soup (pretty al dente) and stirred fried beef rice noodle with gravy ( fianc√© thinks it could be more salty but I like it just fine). Good spot in SW when you don't wanna drive to Chinatown."}
{"text":"So I have been driving by this place for a while now and I decided to give them a try....  Well let's just say that I walked in and after 5 minutes I walked back out.  The place was totally empty.... And yes it was a little before 9pm... So maybe that's why it was so empty??  From other ppl's review it seems that they got pretty decent food and service here....   Maybe i should've come with them.  My service or lack there of is why the one star....   I walked in and I was greeted right away.... But when I walked up to place an order the girl behind counter walked up to me and blocked me from walking up to the counter.  I was like ok.... So I stopped about 5 feet from the counter and asked her one question...  Would it be possible to get a large soup with half egg drop and half hot and sour soup?   She proceeded to make faces at me like I was crazy that I was making that request.... Then proceeded to tell me what a bad idea that was and told me that they would just add extra egg into the hot and sour soup.  What she didn't understand was that I like the sweetness from the egg drop soup and the spiciness and the sour from the hot and sour soup all mixed together. To me that is the best soup.  I have never had an issue getting this at any other Chinese restaurant.  But apparently at this restaurant it is a HUGE ISSUE.  Then she proceeded to tell me that it was going to be a long long wait since there was a large order ahead of me.  I guess the family order is a huge order when u only have 1 person working in the kitchen.  So since i was only ordering for one person.... I guess my order didn't count???  And she made it very very clear that she did not want my business. So I walked out. Why bother spending my hard earned money at a restaurant that doesn't want it?  So if u go and have good service.... Congrats.... Apparently I wasn't in the lucky bunch.  If you have great food... Congrats... Cuz I didn't get to taste anything at all...  So for me I will not be coming here again.... Even though they are the closest Chinese restaurant to me...  I went to Pho Annie instead... They gave me good service and good food... :)   So good luck everyone.... And may the odds be ever in your favor.... Lol"}
{"text":"Best healthy Chinese in town! You must support this place if health means anything to you!  No MSG NOT salty Amazing prices you last saw in 1980s Enormous menu choices Great homey taste Enormous choices  Convenient location with no hassle parking unlike some spring mountain places  You guys rock! We come from summerlim but you are worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the family meal. Short story, everything is over priced and no flavor! Egg drop soup was very greasy no flavor other then oil. Egg rolls were under cooked, rice was bland, cream cheese rangoons had no filling. You can tell they take shortcuts on all their food. $2 for a 12 Oz can of Pepsi... the place is a rip off! Go somewhere else. I signed up on yelp specifically because I was so disappointed with this visit and wanted to warn others."}
{"text":"Finally! I'm happy to have finally found some good fast-food chinese. Service is extremely friendly, prices are very reasonable, and the food tastes good. I recommend any of the HK style pan fried noodles, especially the soy sauce noodles as they have great flavor and great value at only $6-$7."}
{"text":"This is not just another China-A-Go-Go type place. They have authentic Hong Kong style dishes and it's not greasy. The price is right and delivery charge is very reasonable. The quality of food is very consistent, not oily and not too salty just like how they advertise themselves. It has been my go-to place to order from without guilt (because it's not unhealthy and oily like other fast food Chinese places) when I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for weeks waiting for its opening. The boss and employees are so friendly and provided great service. I ordered the egg drop soup, shrimp egg foo young and Hong Kong style beef with dry noodles. The taste was so fresh I felt like I was in Hong Kong again."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. I thought it might be a wait since they were receiving a delivery at the time but the staff was spot on. I was greeted right when I walked in. The guy at the counter offered some suggestions which I picked one of.  He called the cook over.  he also greeted me and lickity split my food was ready!  I ordered to go. I liked the to go containers they use, which are not the normal Chinese food fare. These will keep the food better because let's face it, the best thing about takeout Chinese food is the leftovers!!  Huge portion!  I ate three meals off of it.  I had generals chicken and the chicken pieces were huge!  Really great deal and great service. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Special Dietary needs met. The chef / owner prepared my family a meal according to our vegetarian requirements. He spent time with me to hear my requirements and suggested many options. I loved that about them. The service was excellent. Food was tasty and very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! I went tonight and ordered one of family meals and it was the perfect amount of food. Everything was so flavorful! We had great service; drinks were kept full and our teapot was always replaced. Dishes were cleared off quickly too.   Living in Summerlin, I wish I lived on this side of town to utilize more often!  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but I felt compelled to do one here because I'm worried it might close down if more people don't come and then I'll lose my new fav Chinese restaurant in town!!  I'm from Hong Kong myself and I find the food here to be authentic and good. The prices are reasonable, the restaurant is casual but clean, and the service is good.... But most importantly I love that they make their dishes with no msg and uses less salt and oil than other Chinese restaurants in town. Everything I've tried so far is great and I'll definitely1 come again!"}
{"text":"Good alternative to the semi-fast food you get at Panda Express.  Don't get me wrong, I like Panda Express but this place is a delicious change up.  We ordered Sesame Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Beef Chow Fun.  All were delicious, but the \"star of the show\" was the Sesame Chicken.  Wow...great chicken meat with yummy sauce...kinda sorta like Panda Express' Orange Chicken.  Service was good and the chef even came out to talk with us a few minutes.  Check out this place...it's easy to miss as you drive down Rainbow, but really worth checking out.  Plates run mostly from $9.95 and up."}
{"text":"Food is reasonable and I love it that they're fried rice has veggies not just fried rice and eggs very clean great service . I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and season just right for the taste buds. I will be coming back. Orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and pork fried rice OMG so good..."}
{"text":"The food is decent here. Typical of a chinese food neighborhood joint. The portion is pretty good for the price. Lunch special starts from $5.95. I like that the food is less greasy, the place is kept clean and the server here is very friendly. Obviously not the best chinese food in town, but if you work or live nearby, it's convenient and offers good value."}
{"text":"They have a really good deal for lunch. You get an entree, egg roll, and soup ranging from $6-8 depending on what entree you get.   I got the house noodle special. It was good. The shrimp was good. It wasn't some low grade shrimp which I enjoyed. The noodles were perfect. The flavor was good.   I also got the orange chicken and general chicken. They both tasted the same. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two. I didn't even which one was which. The fried rice was good. The egg rolls were okay.   I would come to this place if you're really hungry and don't care about the flavor"}
{"text":"Was getting my car repaired at FireStone so walked over here after seeing the lunch special sign and I must say....amazing lunch special! $5.95 and I got a drink, soup, egg roll, won ton chips and cashew chicken with steamed rice!   Food was solid, fresh and the staff was really friendly. Talked with the guy behind the counter for a bit and he really enjoys cooking and was just an all around friendly guy.   For what this place is ( tiny, quick place to grab a bite ) it's fantastic value!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese I've had in a really long time. Service was fast and friendly and the place was really clean"}
{"text":"Small portion, and taste just ok. Too much pepper in their hot and sour soup. The only thing that worth the 3stars is the service. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"You guys don't even deserve 1 star! Worst Chinese food I've ever tasted! Shitty food! Your guys pork chops are a joke! Orange chicken?! It tasted nothing like Orange chicken! Nothing but ginger! Your egg rolls were stale!!!!! Your soups were beyond flavorless!!! Your water tasted like it came from the toilet! Never ever coming here again!!!!! Id rather drive all the way to China Town on Spring Mountain! Your guys quality of food is disappointing! Waste of money and time"}
{"text":"Being in Vegas for 3 years, I learned that most of the Chinese restaurants here taste basically the same and is very mediocre to disappointing. I work very near this place and gave it a try for lunch. I judge how good a Chinese restaurant is by the quality of their fried rice. I ordered the combination fried rice and I have to honestly say it is the absolute worst I ever had. I can cook better than this on my worst day! Never ever coming back here to try anything else! I'm so upset I wasted my time and money!"}
{"text":"Sad to say my search for good chinese food  in the southwest continues. We ordered the orange chicken, cashew beef, house fried rice, and egg drop soup. The orange chicken wasn't crispy, flavor was mediocre.  Cashew beef had zero flavor. Fried rice wasn't fried and also had no flavor. Egg drop soup was bland as well. Only pro was quick delivery. Surprised by all of the 5 start reviews. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I am glad we finally have an authentic Chinese restaurant with reason price in this side of town.  I have been going to Spring mountain, Chinatown area for good Chinese food.  I like their beef Chow Fun.  It is excellent.  The place is clean and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Best Cantonese food in Las Vegas!!!  Lovely people, excellent food at very reasonable prices.    We ordered Potstickers which were just right;  Chicken in hot  garlic sauce was done to perfection; and Orange chicken, crispy and tender.   The chef did all possible to prepare to our individual tastes which is a plus for any good restaurant.    Another customer, Oliver,  requested no salt and said this was one of the few kitchens that prepare foods and sauces fresh and are willing to do that. He designed his own version of Singapore noodle and shared it with us.   I asked for a NY favorite, garlic wontons, a steamed wonton in a rich garlic sauce with sesame.  The chef made us an order and I'm thrilled to say he will add this to the private menu!    Try Oliver's Singapore Noodle or Sandi's Garlic wontons.  Both are special customer requests which the chef was eager to make and has added to his menu.  What a novel idea!    Hope to see you there and yes, they do deliver.     The staff was very nice, friendly and accommodating.   The restaurant clean and inviting.  To go boxes for leftovers as the dishes are quite ample.  We are so thrilled to find our resident family Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Lunch special had a good portion and was very flavorful! We also dinner versions of the Mongolian beef and shrimp and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent place!!!! Great people and awesome service. It's a must try. The food is very reasonable and delicious. Even have a very nice dining room for family or friends and the waitress yesterday was awesome. Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"I'm extremely in love with this place. I just ordered online (this is my third time eating their food in 1 week) great, service, clean place, AMAZING DELICIOUS FOOD, I'm obsessed with their spicy soup. I will recommend to everyone this place. I can't wait to explore the menu more! Hands down great great place :) I will suggest if you're feeling a little sick get their hot n sour soup with a side of steamed rice. - I wrote this review as I patiently wait for my food to be delivered. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese food and the closest place was Grand Sign Kitchen, so we had Beef and Broccoli and Orange Chicken meal delivered to our house. The delivery time was good and when we opened the boxes up the food looked fresh. Once we started eating I looked at my girlfriend and she said there is no flavor. I took 2 bites of the orange chickens and totally agreed with her that there should have been some garlic and/or other appetizing seasonings. I don't like to write bad reviews, but Panda Express was better than this place. I hope the owner pays close attention to these reviews because I'm not the only one who stated that the flavor was dull. The rice was fresh, but dull!! The beef and broccoli was fresh, but dull. If you care about your restaurant please listen to your customers and add some seasonings or additional flavorful ingredients."}
{"text":"I ordered house mei fun.it had lots of meat and was delicious. The place was fast and friendly. Will definitely return back and try some lunch specials. Thanks."}
{"text":"I didn't order any crazy custom soups, but what I did order tasted pretty great. It's standard American Chinese fair, but higher quality than a fast food \"panda\" type place. The couple working there were super friendly, and the service was pretty quick.   The only suggestion I would make for them is make combo meals. Sometimes you don't want giant portions. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese place.. no MSG.. healthy! Mom and pop type place.. again healthy is key"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place SUCKS!!! I hate to give a new business a bad review... But I have such HIGH standards for Authentic Chinese food... Ordered Honey Walnut Prawns, they were So So... HK Style Chow Mein, No Flavor to sauce what so ever... Mongolian Beef ( or should I say ) Mongolian Onion, Sucked Ass!!! Literally 8 small thin Slices of beef w a LOT of Onions!!! Had to try this place a 2nd time... 1st time was better than this... Customer service was better last time too... I believe the owners son helped me this time and had no idea about the food on the menu, had to go back to ask his dad a few times b4 he took my order... Overall experience and food I rate at 1 star... I guess I'll stick to driving to Spring Mountain or Panda Express... Just wasted $40 :'("}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here the other day for the first time and we loved the service, the mom and pop feel of the place. The food was very good, and very authentic Chinese. We liked that the menu had a lot to choose from!"}
{"text":"LONG STORY SHORT: Go somewhere else. Grand Sign is not currently up to par with the competition nearby, seek your Chinese fix with Baidu Bistro across the street.  I really wanted to enjoy Grand Sign, however it just doesn't compete with local Chinese eateries near by. Mom was craving a hamburger, and of course, being the half-Asian I am, was craving some Chinese food.   This location is right by the Cheeburger Cheeburger, near the Autozone off of Rainbow and Warm Springs. Pretty neat looking interior, you would definitely feel comfortable dining in if that were your choice.  I ordered Chicken with Broccoli and the Wor Wonton Soup. Gentleman cashier politely told me about 15-20 minutes, which seemed a little much given that there was only one couple in the restaurant with me. 15 minutes later, mom comes in discreetly hiding her outside food (lol), and sits with me to wait, to which the cashier yells \"5 more minutes\" out. Eventually, about another 10 minutes later my food finally comes up right after the couples order, which wasn't much either. Cashier thanked me for my patience and we went home.   Went home and dug in. The Chicken with Broccoli was very average. It certainly looked fresh, tender chicken, crunchy vegetables, however it lacked any garlicy flavor and lacked the garlic sauce you expect with this dish. The Wor Wonton Soup was average as well, dumplings were soggy, chicken bland, shrimp decent. Not worth the $18 price tag.  I'm pretty sure there was only one cook working at that time because there is no excuse for a 25-30 minute ticket time for one dish and a soup. Food quality not up to par to compete with others nearby. Definitely a skip."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. The orange chicken and the egg rolls are really good! The people here are kind, and service is good."}
{"text":"This is my first time here after they opened for a week and the place isn't bad. The food comes out quick and hot off the wok, which is ideal for lunch and they're prices are very competitive.  Food: Very good value. With lunch prices between $5.95 - $7.95 you can't expect the best cut of meat or the brand name products. But the veggies are fresh and the main chef knows how to handle the wok well and the flavor is pretty good.  Environment: It is very clean but don't expect anything fancy. It's designed for you to get in, enjoy your meal and be on your way.  Service: The service is friendly and enthusiastic so I can't knock off points. But I seriously think the server didn't have a lot of prior experience serving tables."}
{"text":"This is a fast food sit down Chinese restaurant.  The server was very attentive and checked on us repeatedly.  The food was very good considering the low price.  My general chicken lunch was a healthy serving with rice and egg roll for $6.95.  The Mongolian beef was good. However, don't expect filet minion for $5-7.    Overall a good deal and a good lunch."}
{"text":"This place is seriously under the radar for some quick decent chinese food in the neighborhood!   They are always wonderfully nice 100% of the times I have come in, they are crazy quick service but the quality is way way better than you'd expect for that speed.  As if that isn't enough, their food is actually super inexpensive. They got lunch specials that feel like high way robbery! Comes with an abundance of entree options to choose from, egg rolls, and a soup for under $10. I DARE you to beat those prices! Haha. Just not happening.  All in all, this is the spot for your China fix if you're around these parts."}
{"text":"Not bad, definitely a little better than the other nearby fast food take out Chinese options.  I got Mapo Tofu and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, both of which are supposed to be spicy.  They are indeed mildly spicy, maybe a 3/10 on the legit spicy scale, which is great for me but if you want it really spicy you'll have to ask.  These are both lighter, healthier dishes, not breaded, not too oily, sweet, or heavy.  The flavor on both dishes was very good and I did not need to add soy sauce.  The Mapo Tofu is a bit lacking in veggies (there's just a tiny sprinkling of the from-frozen pea & carrots you get in fried rice normally, which I personally hate - but I think traditionally there are no veggies for this dish).  Portion for price is fair but not generous.  They do include a tiny bowl of rice, but if you like a lot of rice maybe fire up the rice cooker at home."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. We ate some broken glass. The owner, also the cook who made our take out foods.  When my two young kids from ages 3-6  and I went there to pick up our foods and the owner saw us too. Once we got home and ate the foods. I felt some pain in my mouth and tasted blood. I spit out the food and I saw a piece of broken glass in the food. I stopped my kids from eating the food immediately, but they already ate a lot already. I called the owner and he admitted he broke a jar of sauce while cooking our foods and thought it didn't drop in our foods. Unbelievable, he saw my little kids were with me while picking up the foods, and he still take the chance and risk my kids' lives with that broken glass. Kids, they usually just eat whatever we give to them and won't question it. He didn't want to throw away those foods that might have broken glass on it and willingly to risk his customer's  life. I will never go back there again. Obviously, the owner doesn't care what his customer is eating, he just want money. I hope my kids and I didn't swallow any broken glasses unknownly. Very scary.   And the owner was mad and rude to me like he was yelling at me when I asked him why would he still let me and my kids eat the food when you know there's some chances that the broken glass maybe on our foods because when glass broke, it fly everywhere, not just one place especially the jar of sauce was for my foods, so it was broken very closely to our foods. Bad owner, very selfish, doesn't care his customers at all."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I have been here a few times because their food are so delicious. I'm a person who is really sensitive to MSG, and most Chinese restaurants put a lot of MSG into the food which I feel sick every time after I eat it. Yet, this place manage to have tasty food without putting MSG.   The service here is great compared to other Chinese restaurants. Plus, I don't think the portion here is small. The food portion is normal like any other place. I really recommend people to eat here. It's REALLY GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. The server was very welcoming and nice to us. Lunch special was great and the portion was pretty big. I came here for \"to go\" food and the food and service was great. Don't let the old/past reviews overwhelm you, from the service that I have been getting lately, everything is fine and in top shape"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for any kind of good. We eat here at least once a week, sometimes more. Food is prepared after you order and it is fabulous!!!!!!!!!!! If you like Chinese, this is the place to go, bar none."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place through restaurant.com & we are definitely glad we did . If you are about quality , freshness, & flavor , this is your place for chinese .  I havent found a \"i am definitely coming back\" chinese spot until i came here . You can actually distinguish the taste in the food you order & the freshness of \"made upon ordering\" .  The staff is very friendly and attentive . We ordered the crab ragoons, walnut shrimp, general tso chicken lunch special & kung pao lunch special . Each dish has great flavor , even the egg drop soup, a dish hard to mess up , but youd be surprised . That little soup bowl had tons of flavor , i was amazed . I will definitely bit a returning customer . Try this place out . They're true to their advertisements ."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place could have anything less than a 5-star. They are clean, the service is so wonderful and the food is delicious. I take my family here once or twice a week for lunch and dinner and they are great every time. The food is consistently good and the price is so fair! Matter of fact, I think it's pretty inexpensive compared to other Chinese places around here and their food taste so much better. I once ordered to-go from them and the way they packaged the food was not in cheap made to go boxes but in good leak-proof containers. It was wonderful, no leakage in my car.   I normally get their Mongolian beef, broccoli beef, mapo tofu, general tso chicken, Kung pao chicken, fried rice and honey walnut shrimp. I don't get all of this in one sitting"}
{"text":"I used uberEats and they messed up my order. They didn't add my house fried rice. When i called in the lady was very rude.  I won't be ordering here ever again nor use uberEats either."}
{"text":"I like their service. They are so nice I just come here to buy to go and they wrapped it really nice. While I'm waiting for my order and they still serve me water"}
{"text":"do not waste your time and money here, he had 3 strings of hair in our food and when we complained to the manager which was also the owner he told us to \"shuu\" he was rude didnt even care. plus the worker in kitchen wasnt wearing a hair net. we got sick after eating here.."}
{"text":"Fresh made to order, fast service, attentive staff, clean.. and the food is really good, healthy serving, inexpensive & it is very good! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"What a shock this little place was for us.    It looks like a low end Chinese takeaway but nothing could be farther from the truth!   This place has some serious Chinese cooking going on in the Grand Sign Kitchen.   I was quite surprised with the quality of the food and the variety of authentic Chinese dishes.  Well prepared Mapo Tofu, fried rice, salt and pepper pork chop, and cashew chicken.  They had plenty of Americanized Chinese food as well so your less adventurous friends won't mind coming here.    Give this place is try and you will be shaking your head in surprise when you step outside after a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"+PROS: friendly staff, clean/new interior, good portion for lunch special price  -CONS: actual food is sub-par chinese (so far i had the egg foo young, hk style noodles, egg drop soup, beijing beef?), service is a little slow  i would give this place 3 stars BUT the one thing that was pretty good was the mabo tofu (which i recommend)* plus this place has a lot of potential  suggestions: menu needs work especially the soups (awful) ...the egg foo young...not sure what that was i ate but it wasn't the \"foo\" that you are normally used to"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since they opened and it is by far the best Chinese in this area. The food is fresh made to order, service is excellent, and for dinner orders you can ask them to tweak your food (I.e. don't put peas and carrots, add extra bean sprouts).  Lunch specials are solid and priced well for what you get.  As other reviews stated, the decor is lacking but the staff mentioned that they are redecorating (if they haven't already by the time I post)."}
{"text":"I love Vid's (The Executive Chef)  Ma Po ToFu, the Mongolian Beef, Walnut Shrimp are amazing. The Food is so fresh and colorful too...Jennifer is amazing and their wait staff are all really service oriented. I usually dine in and the portions are so good, I always have left overs to bring back to enjoy for later. I highly recommend bringing your family and friends. You will love Vid's cooking!"}
{"text":"The lady at the front was extraordinarily nice she gets 5 stars alone. The food came out fast as I ordered it there to-go I think I was out in about 7 minutes. I got chicken lo mein and hot n sour soup. The lo mein wasn't mind blowing but good. The hot and sour soup was entirely way to peppery for me and I ended up tossing it. Next time I'm in the mood for Chinese I'll be back to try other things."}
