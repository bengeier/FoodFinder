{"text":"Stayed here for a long weekend.   Reserved a standard room with a king size bed. Check in was quick and painless. However, was given keys to a room with two double beds. Was told that all reservations made through third parties are automatically given a room w/ two doubles.....was ultimately given a room with a king bed. No big deal. Hotel was a virtually empty.   Hotel is old, old, old. The safety on the electrical outlet kept getting tripped by the ultra-high voltage device I always carry with me...my cell phone charger. Television set was ancient and terrible. Lock on the room door was broken. This might not make sense, but the room was very creaky. Bed was worn out.   Now back to my comment regarding the hotel being virtually empty. The last night of our stay, a bus load of 10-13 year olds on a field trip were put in rooms on all sides of us. It was as if they literally put us in their block of rooms. There must have been forty of them with no more than one or two chaperons. They commenced to bang around and scream till the wee hours of the morning. Why is God's name did they have to put them all around us in an empty hotel?   With so many other great options in Scottsdale, certainly no reason to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a little getaway and was very happy with the hotel. Very friendly staff. Good size room for the price. Modern look and very clean."}
{"text":"Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!"}
{"text":"This is a much older property so when you come in you feel it's below normal standard of Hilton. The room is really old and country style feeling (meaning more casual), but the bathroom is really small, hardly have any space if you have two people in there.   Big Pros is their breakfast bar is super great. Food and service are nice, that's the only highlight I can say. I might just come back for the breakfast, but might stay in other place if I need.    Cons is, besides the quality of the property is much lower than other Hilton, their front desk people are kinda in a mess.   We booked a room to stay for two nights, and when we arrived early morning for check in, our room has already been sold to someone else, and they have no other similar type of room in this hotel (the most expensive one they offer). We have already been charged for the deposit for that room. This is so unacceptable! How come they sell your paid room to other customers without informing you and double check if you want to cancel it, or you do not intend to show up?   Could't offer us the same type of room, the manager can only give us the standard room for two nights instead. I asked him if we will get charged for the room we originally booked, because in my understanding we will, but he said no, and there is no charge yet. OK we believe in his words, and it turns out to be a lie- we got charged for what they called \"cancellation fees\" for the room they didn't keep for us. After we found out, I called the accounting dept refunded that part. So I guess their manager either didn't do his job to cancel the charge, or he just fooled on us and hoped that we won't check credit card account and find that out. Sigh  Except the charges for two nights, the wrong cancellation fee charge, we also got charged for $280 for no reason. Their accountants cannot even find the charge in their system, they don't know what it is...too ridiculous to be true. They triple charged us and don't have a clue...I seriously doubt the security system in this Hilton. Probably someone stole our card just swiped it multiple times...having stayed in so many Hilton, never experienced any service like this.  Three hours later, their accountant finally be able to sort it out and call me back, that the $280 was the \"no show up\" charge. He admitted that room we booked was \"double booked\" that night, and that's why when we tried to check in the room was unavailable. He refunded me that part, sort things right.   In the end, I think this is what happened- the front desk guy who created a new reservation for the standard room for us did not cancel the previous reservation, so we kept being charged. Glad we found it out and cured the mistake!!! But the whole experience is such a disaster...would not recommend this hotel based on the service and management."}
{"text":"I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room. Whomever handles that for your place is doing great work."}
{"text":"All the staff have been very friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived. I have come to expect good service from Hilton as I almost always have great experiences at their properties.  But today while I was gone, the housekeeper accidentally broke my bottle of perfume. I was bummed when I returned to my room to find out, and the housekeeper was very apologetic. I understand things like this happen, and was expecting to get a coupon or maybe a free dinner or something. Instead, the manager showed up at my room about an hour or so later with a shopping bag...they had replaced the perfume by buying me a new bottle. That's great customer service! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The Hotel is in the best possible location for walkable restaurants and Scottsdale Rd. is the heart of everything.  If feels like a Hilton, the Ambassador, James, should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for being himself and the concierge is just as kind.   The Spa was small but accommodating.  The Jr. Suite on the second floor is spacious and the bed is just what the doctor ordered.  Sleep was sound and comfortable, A/C not loud and the creaky ceilings reported in previous reviews was not a problem.  I've placed the \"trouble\" part down here where management will read it but most Yelpers won't bother so this is your \"gimme\" managers!  The trouble:  We noticed a wet, funky smell coming from the hallway and the buckled carpets implied a water problem and after returning from a day hiking we noticed our room smelled like old cheese.  We reported the problem to the front desk and she offered a similar room on the bottom floor sans funky smell but it wasn't the same. Then she offered to have maintenance come up and \"spray\" the room.  This is the comment that prompted 2 stars. You don't offer to \"spray\" a room that a customer has willingly paid $200 a night for three nights!    Hilton, you can do better than this or maybe you've changed your protocol for pursuing the Gold standard?  With people like James in the Lobby and Tom in the Wellness Center, why skimp on the training for the front desk on Monday night?  Suggestion: Give the staff the authority to proactively explain why the floor is buckled and smells like old sewer and beg our pardon with anything positive, perhaps a breakfast or a discount on the next stay or even, god forbid, an upgrade to a nicer room that is unoccupied for the next few nights.   That extra bit of training would have been worth it and an extra 2 stars!"}
{"text":"The villas were great! Perfect for family stay. Washer and dryer. Updated rooms."}
{"text":"As a local resident I have lived near this Hilton since it was built.  For many years it was a great place to have a \"Staycation\" or to enjoy a meal with special visitors.  Several years ago things started going downhill and now I'm afraid I can't recommend it.  One recent experience tells the whole story.  It was my mom's 76th birthday and my sister flew into town.  Wanting a special experience I said, \"Let's have breakfast at the Hilton!\"  We went into the Oasis hungering for eggs Benedict.  \"Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast\" they told us immediately.  Ok... well in my experience a luxury hotel should never say no, but we went ahead and ordered lunch and ice tea.  15 minutes later I had to flag down a busser and request our iced tea to be actually served.  A looooooooong wait later, fidgeting and about ready to leave mad, our food arrived.  Fries were ice cold.  Food, meh.  The $85 (with tip) bill was the appropriate charge for a true luxury breakfast.  For average food and poor service it was an insult.  The poor lone waiter was a nice guy and that's the only reason for a two star rating, not a one star.    Oh, and lest I forget to mention it, they thought it was a good idea to bleach mop the floor beside us while we were eating.  The smell of bleach is very appetizing, right?"}
{"text":"We recently stayed at the Hilton Scottsdale Resort & Villas. I was rather disappointed in the two things. First of all, they had no \"Handicap\" parking anywhere near where are rooms were. They di have designated \"Valet Only\" parking but no self park. Secondly, I went to their Oasis bar to have a beer and was surprised to see the price---$9.72 for a plastic glass of draft beer. Now I know the football game was on TV but I didn't realize I had to pay stadium prices for beer."}
{"text":"Stayed here for business last week and my reaction is: meh.    Nothing special about this Scottsdale Road property.  It was really pretty expensive $279/night in April and you don't get a lot for your money.    Nothing \"wrong\" with the place, but you can do better for the money.   I don't know how they can call it a \"resort\" unless have a pool qualifies you - no golf/tennis, no spa, etc.  Just a hotel."}
{"text":"Wish it could be 2 1/2 stars.  In town for business and the Hilton was the \"overflow\" hotel from the conference.  The good: *The Lobby Ambassador James is amazing. There is no way on earth you can't be happy around this man. Beautiful soul. * Location was good and central to everywhere we needed to be. * Most of the staff was very professional and friendly. * Comfy bed * Spacious room *Decent, free wi-fi * Good area for using a computer/printing *Huge bath towels  The not-so-good: * Super thin walls. This is a deal breaker for me. Not only could I hear my neighbors through the wall (sounding like Charlie Brown's teacher) but I could hear them intelligibly through the bathroom vent. Very strange.  * The ceiling creaks. Loudly. This is the strangest thing. I was on the top floor and the ceiling creaked often. A couple times it woke me up. * All the TV channels didn't work. In fact, most of them didn't. The hotel tried to fix but couldn't so they did comp me some room service. *Someone prior to me had opened the mini bar and it was left open. I didn't realize until my last night.Everything was knocked over and the unit was warm.  Overall, lots of things seem slightly dated."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly luxurious, spacious, and well-staffed hotel. I couldn't believe I could get a full kitchen, separate bedroom, and family food package -- in a villa -- for just $135 a night! (August off-season deal.) The villa was above and beyond my expectations! It had two large bedrooms each with attached full bathrooms, a full kitchen (fridge, stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher) AND a washer/dryer in the room. The villas are tucked behind a strip mall and set apart from the main hotel, which is about a block away. They have their own pool and there's access to a beautiful, huge pool at the main hotel. The breakfast offered with the family package is wonderful, fresh food. I detracted one star because the property and rooms are a little older and worn in places, as well as the awkwardness of how far away the villas are from the main hotel. The staff was great. Had a great stay and would go again!"}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel December 8-10, 2015 for a conference.  The hotel itself is very beautiful, with a holiday decorated lobby, and well landscaped pool and lounging area. They have infused water daily in the lobby and it is DELICIOUS! Each day was a different flavor, I can tell you I drank this water all day, every day that I was there.  They also offered a brochure with recipes to make your own water at home.  A really cool little perk, and I love that they had more than just standard coffee and tea for basic refreshment.  The room was very clean, and aside from the bathroom, very spacious.  The bathroom was TINY.  When you open the door to the bathroom, the door just misses hitting the commode...it was an awkward set up.  The water pressure and temperature were both good.  I loved that they give you a full range of travel soaps including shampoo, conditioner (so rare at hotels anymore), bar soap and shower gel and a shower cap.  I didn't love that the scents of these products as they were a bit on the manly-smelling side. I can understand that it must be difficult to find a unisex fragrance but there has to be a better one than the one these soaps had.  So if you are female travelling to this hotel, bring your own. If you're a male, you're good to go!   The first night there I ordered room service, I went for easy and just got a burger and fries, it was probably one of the best room services meals I've ever had. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the fries were crispy and hot.  It was also delivered quickly which was awesome.  Sleeping was not easy at this hotel...the beds were squeaky...every time I rolled over the bed frame squeaked loudly.  Also, the room did not have a good barrier against sound.  All night long I heard people in the hallway, doors slamming shut, and a couple of times I even heard the TV from the room next door.  It was frustrating to not be able to get a good nights sleep either night I was there.   The second night I was there I went next door to Fleming's for dinner...very convenient as I did not have a car and this hotel did offer several dining options.  I was able to eat in the bar area with their happy hour menu, the crowd was friendly and the service and food were perfect.  I would absolutely recommend eating here, especially if you are trying to save money(I know not a normal statement for Fleming's Steakhouse ha ha).  The happy menu goes until 7 pm, the burger and fries is $7 and it's probably the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.  The Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini was $6 and it was very tasty.   They offer two happy hour menus, one from 5-7 PM and one from 7-9 PM each with their own unique dinner/drink choices and prices.  The 5-7 PM menu is slightly cheaper, but either option is a great way to eat at a gourmet steakhouse and still save money.  We were in Salons 1 & 2 for the conference, very quiet and spacious, perfect for a conference setting.  Both days offered a light continental breakfast and a lunch, I assume both were catered by the hotel's restaurant.  The food was very good, and the choices were plentiful.  The first day's lunch alone offered chicken, beef, sides and salads, along with an array of desserts.     The wi-fi at this hotel is very frustrating...as a HHonors member you get free basic wifi, but it's spotty and doesn't work great. Of course you can pay for better wifi, but with the cost of hotels these days I find it utterly ridiculous that ANY hotel should charge for this feature.  There was a separate wifi connection for the conference rooms, which kept making you refresh and go to the Hilton screen. It was very annoying that the wifi was not constant.   If I had to base this review on staff alone, I would give 5 stars.  The entire staff was some of the friendliest I've ever encountered at a hotel. From check-in, room service, housekeeping, and check-out, they were all attentive and always said hello.  Also, the gift shop was a great find as well. They were having a huge sale while I was there and I picked up a perfect weekend travel bag for around $15.  Apparently they have these sales often, so if you stay there, definitely stop into the gift shop, they have a ton of great souvenir type stuff.  Overall my stay was okay...but I can't say that I would stay here again (barring a work event) because I can overlook a lot of things, but not being able to sleep is a huge issue for me. Especially when the things that prevented me from sleeping could have been avoided."}
{"text":"Huh?  They charge  $50 for \"anticipated\" incidentals daily?!?  I've never heard of such a thing and I do travel a fair amount.  When I conveyed my dismay to the desk clerk she told me not to worry because the charges would be reversed only 72 hours after check-out??!!??  WTF????  Hilton gets to use additional money of mine for the days I stay and then releases it back to me 3 days after I check-out????  Is this legal????"}
{"text":"Fiancé added my name to the room online (using the hilton website) since he would be coming in later that night. I had a copy of the email confirmation from hilton but the ladies in the front desk wouldn't let me check in without him calling. I just showed you the confirmation email with my name... Could show you my ID to verify. Didn't care, said online requests don't count... Seriously. I would have had to wait the entire day in the lobby if my friends weren't there because he was taking finals and couldn't be disturbed. During the nights, you hearing creaking noises from the ceiling and walls and the tv at the outside bar had poor reception throughout my stay- mentioned to them but they said they couldn't do anything about it. Good location though, close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping."}
{"text":"We checked in to this beautiful resort and are staying in one of the Villas. The accommodations are perfect for a group with privacy and amenities.  One of the true highlights are the Bell Captains Keith and Dave. They will drive you anywhere at any time within a 3 mile radius.  Their customer service is exceptional and their friendly demeanor puts you right at ease. They offer suggestions for activities in the area, to restaurants and shopping. I give them 5 stars PLUS!!"}
{"text":"We recently stayed in one of the villas for three nights. The space was very comfortable, updated, and spacious. The villa had two bedrooms and two full baths, kitchen, and living/dining, which was huge. The problem we had: the air conditioner kept flipping the breaker. Repairmen came three days in a row, but it was never fixed. We were assured it wasn't a fire hazard, but I wasn't convinced. We didn't use the spa (if there is one).  We didn't use the pool, which looked adequate, but not fabulous. Breakfast buffet was very nice.  All staff members were very friendly and helpful. If your purpose is to lounge around a huge, fabulous resort hotel, I'm not sure if this hotel would be what you're looking for. If you're wanting a comfortable, spacious place to relax and settle in at the end of the day, one of the villas is perfect.     We booked our trip through Southwest Airlines vacation packages. Airfare, hotel, and rental car... All in one price. Very nice and easy."}
{"text":"Clean rooms very quiet.  Close to everthing and we ventured to old town only a mile or two from the hotel. B"}
{"text":"I stayed here recently, and for the money I spent, thought the room would have a view of the mountains (which was advertised on website), but was given a 1st floor room with the window facing the parking lot and parked cars.  I mean, really??  Not worth spending $215.00 for the room, and do not appreciate them taking $50.00 from my debit card for \"incidentals\".  Now I have to wait for several days to get a credit and was never told it would cost that much for one day!  After unpacking, I went to the Oasis Grille.  Took 10 minutes to get a glass of water (while sitting in the heat), and when I realized that these 2 female servers were taking care of the entire pool area and grille, I felt it would be quicker to order just a dessert - it took 20 minutes to be delivered!!  I also noticed that there was no bartender and the 2 female servers were forced to do it all.  Really?? - Hilton can't afford to hire a bartender for outside by the pool?  And, the bathroom is so small that you have the door right there in your face.  I thought the bathroom would be a bit bigger for the money I spent.  I felt like I was staying at a motel instead of a hotel!  Over-rated and over-priced.  I could have spent the same amount of money and got so much more at another hotel.  What a disappointment.  I did have management reach out to me, but was shocked that he was offering me to come back for a \"discounted\" stay - really?  Hilton can't afford to give me a FREE night's stay?  He said he would send me his e-mail address and \"take care of me\" if I came back, but still waiting for the e-mail.  Don't think I will ever stay there again.  Very disappointing for having picked this \"hotel\" for my \"stay-cation\"!!"}
{"text":"Our family booked a staycation here and our time spent there was fabulous! Our room was very clean down to the grout in the bathrooms. The beds were so comfortable and very clean linens . Front desk was very helpful on locating places to go around there. We ordered room service and the food was excellent. My children enjoyed the pools as they are very well kept and they had pool toys there for them. The staff were very friendly and always had a smile and wished us a good morning. I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars - I would!!  45 min wait for check in. No apologizes. Villa was so far away from the main hotel. Villa was big but outdated. It had a mildew smell. The toilet in the master bathroom ran the whole time. The towel rack broke in the master bathroom also. No bowls for mixing anything. No cookie sheets to go in the oven. No dish towels for the kitchen. The fridge was big but froze the food. The pool for the villas was tiny and the cement was so hot that it burned your feet getting from the chair to the pool.  On day of check out had Hilton knocking on our door asking when we were planning on checking out.  Check out was not till noon. Have never been asked this in all my life.  We are Hilton Honors members also.   No discount for any inconvenience. We will never stay at this Hilton again! Big waste of money, we should of stayed at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Room was small, not much better than  a Holiday Inn Express.  Air conditioner didn't work in our room, they brought us a fan (we moved to a new room the next day).  Staff very unfriendly.  Bathroom very small.  Pool area very plain.  Good location.  Would not stay there again."}
{"text":"The hotel is conveniently located and close to shops and restaurants. At times you can hear the traffic if you tend to sleep early. The rooms on the upper floors are nicer than the first floor."}
{"text":"The villas are fab for families and couples!! So much room and privacy! Great location! I've stayed in many other top chains in Scottsdale and this is the one I'll come back to!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful facility and the staff are fantastic. We got lost on the way to our rooms and a housekeeping staff member noticed us and immediately dropped what she was doing and helped us get to our suite. There were several other incidences of this type of generosity of spirit from other employees. From the pool bartender to the check in lady, everyone was pleasant and helpful. The lobby is gorgeous and our room was spotless. WiFi is not free but it's like 5 bucks for 24 hours. Or, if you're cheap you can hang in the lobby and get free wireless internet from an AT&T hotspot! Perhaps my standards are low since we've been staying in roadside inns and motels during our drive from California but I was pleased as punch to stay here. The restaurant served a breakfast sandwich that was really, honestly delicious. I will seriously consider making something similar at home. The coffee? OMG. Amazing. I'm going to be perpetually wired while I stay here! The pool is beautiful and my kids had a blast. Ask for a prickly pear margarita from the pool bar; they're wonderful. I stayed here for an orthodontist convention but if I ever come back to Scottsdale I will be returning HERE."}
{"text":"I have stayed at this Hilton about 4 times now and let me give you some of the good and bad: (Lets start with the bad)  BAD:  The noise bleed between rooms is horrible.  I can confirm other reviewer's experiences.  During a couple of my stays I actually had to sleep with my noise cancelling head phones on because my neighbor slept with their TV on.  What i've noticed is that the noise is worse with 2nd floor rooms due to the slanted wood roofs in the rooms.  The noise seems to come through the corner section where the shared wall meets the slanted ceiling.  No sound proofing seems to be present.  These rooms are where I had the worse noise experiences.  I think the older construction is to blame for that, but the hotel should really fix this soon.  Now, with the first floor rooms, these are not as bad as the 2nd floor rooms, but do have thin enough walls to where you can still hear a lot.  Again, older construction may be to blame.  My advice would be to avoid 2nd floor rooms at all costs and request to be in a 1st floor room with no one next to you.    GOOD:  With all the times that I have stayed here, their service was always wonderful.  From the moment I checked in, to the time I checked out, I never had one complaint or negative thing to say about the service I received.  In addition, the food they served was also pretty good for hotel food.  I don't usually eat hotel room service if I have a choice, but on the few occasions that I was forced to order in, I was impressed at the quality of the food served and service that I recieved from the room service staff.  A great experience everytime.   In the end though, the noise factor really is a deal breaker for me, but other than that one negative aspect and the rooms being a bit outdated, this hotel does offer a decent stay."}
{"text":"Prior to my daughter's ASU graduation in May we searched for the right hotel to host all of our out of town quests.  We needed a convenient location, resort style pool, and a range of rooms from low/mid price to high end.  When we chose the Scottsdale Hilton we hit the jackpot!  I could go on and on about the fabulous weekend we had here but will try to hit just the highlights;  1) EXCELLENT service from check in through check out!  2) We chose a \"villa\" suite (former timeshares) so we could host before and after parties and it was PERFECT - huge, well appointed, convenient, quiet, a great kitchen AND a washer/dryer!  3) The pool was perfect for our group - not too packed, good age range, convenient to the rooms and great bar/food service.  4) Brunch - when we found out we couldn't get seated at our favorite restaurant,  we reserved brunch for 15 literally 1/2 hour before our arrival from the grad ceremony. The restaurant manager (sadly I forgot his name) was VERY accommodating and even held the brunch open later at our request.  And the food was delicious - huge assortment and lots of special touches.  When we return to the area we will always stay at this Hilton and we wholeheartedly recommend you do too!!"}
{"text":"I had trouble finding a hotel or accommodations that would connect two separate bedrooms and not cost an arm and a leg.  The goal was to have a common area to meet during the night, yet sleep in separate quarters.  Many hotels had connecting rooms, but not the living space we desired.  Most condos or villas were either too expensive or required a weekly reservation.  Hilton Resort seemed to have it all including a separate pool for the villas away from the main hotel.    Ultimately I'm torn between liking and disliking the villa unit.  The amenities were great and everything we wanted was included (separate rooms, living room, close parking, a pool), BUT the furnishings were dated, worn, and in some cases in disrepair.  The bar chairs were ripped, the patio umbrella wooden spindles broken.  The pool was super small with low end chairs and no tables.  The room was dark and the patio area faced a wall and the backside of other villas.  The saving grace was the cost in comparison to other accommodations with the same amenities.  Would I go there again?  Maybe.  Was it worth it?  I guess.  Does it look like the advertised pictures?  Definitely not.  Would I stay there for an entire week?  No!"}
{"text":"This franchise Hilton had the nerve to negotiate a contract with a 16 yr old girl for a prom. At the time it was negoitated there was no adult supervisor directly in charge. When the prom was over the hotel charged $7000 more for the evening than the verbal commitment they made to the new teacher in charge. Although legal, this hotel is unethical and I would not recommend doing any business with them."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel for business travel so unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the villas; the company budget wouldn't allow it.  The room I got, in the main hotel, was nice, very spacious and clean.  The bathroom was on the small side but I've experienced worse.  I had a room at the end of the hall, far from the elevator.  I didn't have any issues with noise from neighbors. I have to agree with the post that complained about the lack of electrical outlets in the rooms. It seems so petty, on the surface, but it is really is frustrating when you're trying to work in the room, charge the cell phone, etc.   Positives:  The housekeeping staff did a great job.  The property is in a great location; it's close to lots of great dining and shopping."}
{"text":"We booked one of their Villas due to the fact that we had 4 adults.  Since it was in the middle of summer, the rates were great and I was able to get one of my nights for points.  The Villa bedrooms were very  nice and comfortable with huge bathrooms.  The living room was huge, yet the furniture was a bit uncomfortable.  The kitchen was great and very useful to have.  One strange thing in the kitchen was no dish towel, just paper towels.  Not a big thing.  The main pool was a distance, but it was nice.    I called 3 days before my visit to make sure we would not have to change rooms, as one night was reserved on points (2 separate reservations).  We knew we would be out most of the day and didn't want the hassle of re-checking in, etc.  Was told not a problem and was told the same thing upon check in when I reminded the front desk person that I was there for 2 nights.  He even went into a back area to make my keys so they wouldn't de-activate the next day.  What a surprise to get a nasty phone message that we had over-stayed our welcome and would be charged since we had not checked out.  When I called the desk, the gal changed her story and said she had noticed the other reservation after the phone message was left, but did not apologize.  So why did I call ahead and double check upon check-in???    Overall, I would stay here again, the property isn't huge but was nice and we truly enjoyed our stay."}
{"text":"Every place has an off night.  Shoot we all probably have off nights.  I originally rated this as a 1 star experience.  I'm happy to report they went out of their way to turn around my poor experience.  For that I am changing my review to 5 stars.  This place isn't a palace or a 5 star hotel.  But it's good enough.  Customer service goes a long way.  It's really number one.  I continue to use Hilton when I travel for business.  They're consistent.    Below is my original review.  I'm leaving it as a reminder to myself how crazy and entitled I can get.  Enjoy.........  ............................................................................................  If I could choose a zero or negative number of stars I would.    I've been a Hilton hotel whore over the last 2-3 years of my career.  For the most part they are predictable.  The service and amenities are fine.  Mostly no complaints.  I stayed at one just a week ago.  Usually they are very accomodating.    14 hours ago my business plans changed and I had to fly into Phoenix tonight instead of in the morning because my meeting got pushed to an earlier time.  hilton.com has never failed me.  Tonight they did.  At 12:20 am I rolled into my hotel.  The guy at the desk was nice enough but informed me they were overbooked and I had to go down the street to doubletree.  Fine.  I'm tired.  It's late.  I don't have the will to fight or even think.  He handed me a letter and I walked out looking at the other guests in the lobby with envy because they didn't have to get into their car's and drive to another hotel and start over.  All I wanted was to go to bed, but I'm pissed off.  When I opened my car door it started to hit me.  Yes....I was only going to drive 1.5 miles according to my GPS, but it's almost 1 am and this is an enormous pain in the ass.  I explained that to the guy at the desk at doubletree which he was generically apologetic.  I also mentioned that maybe they shouldn't confirm a reservation if they were overbooked.  How about giving me a heads up?  It's not like I haven't rolled into a hilton after midnight before.    Before I reached the entry of the doubletree I decided they better make it right or I don't have to do business with them anymore.  Sure enough....there was no free room upgrade or valet service.  My consoIation prize was a warm chocolate walnut cookie and a broken smile.    Again....I'll take it up in the morning with the manager.  \"They haven't heard the last of me\".  I don't want to do this either, but jesus!  This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Stayed here twice, once on a visit and the next time when I moved to Scottsdale and was waiting to move into the condo. From the valet to the desk staff everyone was really nice and it seemed as if they loved their job. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. When I ordered room service, it showed up sooner than they said and it was really good. I highly recommend staying here when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm trying really hard not to be harsh. Honest. But this place has so many negatives and so few positives. Many of the reviews here mention the noise. They just don't give enough bad credit to the soundproofing.  This place is horrid for sleeping.  I stayed here Memorial weekend. The room was clean but certainly not elaborately decorated. Needed more towels. Bathroom so-so. Nothing about the room or property decor stated \"upscale\" or \"resort\". Pool needs more lounge chairs, they were all hoarded and taken very early in the day. Misters would be a small but welcome addition to the Oasis bar by the pool. The Oasis bar was frequently understaffed. The poor person stuck there, \"Jaimie\" was very pleasant but overwhelmed by the work load.  The concierge in the lobby was flat rude to several folks on situations I eavesdropped on. Front desk on check in was nothing special. Back to the noise....Walking down the hallway rooms 160's, 170's, etc., my friends and i could and did stop and listen to any number of conversations thru the closed doors. Mind you this was standing in mid-hall, not up against door. Amazed at how poor the soundproofing. At night the place was a crashbox of noise. Simply unacceptable on any level. And certainly poor for a Resort/Spa property. My comments to the front desk regarding noise were treated as, \" Ho-Hum. Heard it all before. \" When asked about Phoenix by coworkers and friends I'll have too, in good manners, steer them far away from this facility. Which is a shame. There is no way I can recommend this place at all. Too many fine properties, good pools, and nice staff at facilities in Phoenix area.  This is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"First off, we are a Hilton Honors member so we try and stay at Hiltons.  We have stayed here before.  Centrally located, standard Hilton so figured we couldn't go wrong.  First, they have significantly raised their rates for this level of hotel, $339 for a standard room, first floor, facing the parking lot, with a very small bathroom tub and shower combo, one small sink and small countertop bathroom.  When we arrived to the room, there was a significant chemical smell.  After opening the window which only allows an opening of three inches, it was better but the smell lingered for two days.  The mattresses are old, sagging with the typical hump in the middle.  But then things really started going down hill.  By the second day, my legs had numerous small clusters bites with severe itching.  After reviewing bug bite images, I have determined they are possibly bed bug bites.  Lastly, the restaurant service is slow.  What was good was the maid service.  When we checked out we also received a $5.00 charge Per Day for Internet.  After discussing this with the desk and told \"we don't charge a resort fee\", which seems appropriate since they truly are not \"a resort with resort grounds\", they removed that fee.  Plan to go back to the Hyatt or elsewhere."}
{"text":"Valerie at Front desk  is Rude.    Demanded $10 plus tax for a king bed instead of 2 beds when the Place  is not even half full.   Rooms are ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the reviews here.  Wen I arrived, the doorman wasn't very helpful- didn't offer to valet, tell me where to park, or take my luggage.  Upon checking in, the not so helpful front desk person didn't tell me where in this large place my room was, nor that I could park closer to it than the front of the hotel.  Food is decent.  That's a plus, I guess.  Room service was warm, and quick.  Breakfast buffet wsa better than most hotels.    I did find the rooms a little noisy, and the hotel wasn't very full at the time I stayed.    The workout room had no working water fountain.  A little bit of a bummer after working up a sweat.  However, they did have quite a bit of room, and some decent equipment.    It was OK.  But I don't think I'd recommend it or stay again."}
{"text":"Stayed at this resort while on a bachelorette trip... It is very spacious and comfortably fit 10 girls and all their belongings (which, if you've never traveled with 10 girls, you know is a whole lot!)."}
{"text":"Rooms are extremely clean and staff friendly.   But what prompted my writing this was the room service Reuben sandwich of all things.  Just by itself worth the trouble of writing and some mention somewhere by somebody.  I'm a connoisseur and this ranked up there with the best NYC/LA/CHI delis - possibly better than most and completely unexpected in Scottsdale, AZ. While there are diverse dining options nearby, if you just feel like staying in and want a perfectly balanced Reuben - especially if you have never had one - you will be blown away. Sauerkraut Swiss Corned Beef Russian Dressing-they do theirs on Marbled Rye-is almost never done this well. You could order this at 50 different major market restaurants and likely none of them would be this good.  I actually called room service back to commend the chef and tell the manager - that good."}
{"text":"Nice hotel for for show and decor only. The night manager behind desk not the most friendly and was not willing to put my Hilton Gold number to my room for credit of stay of two nights. He said he could only put in one number and put in my other crew members number!! Walls were also thin and definitely not sound proofed. Both nights there was a couple doing the \"horizontal hoola hoop\" and making all kinds of scary sounds  The next night the headboard in the opposite side room was just slapping my other wall without all the oohs and ahhhs and \"f~*k ya's\" from the night before !!  Now I'm in the bathroom shaving I can hear that very same couple thru the air conditioning vent like they are showering together with me!  2 stars for the decor and design only, but definitely needs soundproofing."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! First of all, don't call yourself a resort and spa.... The property was just very ok. The service in the restaurant was very mediocre. The staff along with the manager seemed very confused and/or new. They were nice but seemed inexperienced. Now for the spa...this place needs to be shut down. It is run down, dirty, everything was broken, and so small! It's as if they had his space and didn't know what to do with it so they \"fixed\" it up to make some money. The light in the sauna was broken. There was mold in the steam room. The showers looked like they weren't used in a while. They couldn't even afford to have water in the women's locker room. I had to go outside to the common area to get water. Really?!? It's little details that can make a difference. And for the bonus round...the massage therapist came into the locker room to have us pay while we were trying to relax after our overpriced 90 minute massage. Totally unprofessional. Then there was no one at the front desk to help us after our services. Do not run a spa that is understaffed and not perfect and expect people to pay $225 for a massage in closet that was converted into an spa room. I originally gave them 1 star but I did really like my massage. The resort was just not what I expected. I was totally misled. Oh and there was a group smoking at the pool area and the staff did nothing about it. I will never recommend this hotel or ever stay here again."}
{"text":"resort? not really, this an old hotel with very thin walls. rooms are outdated. this was my first and last stay at this place."}
{"text":"Came to hotel for a ballroom comp...  The staff here are awesome!!! I was checked in by Andrew, who made a great first impression...( Andrew should be recognized by the company) later that night I had to use the business center, which has 4 computers (2 Macs and 2 P.C.) I haven't seen to many places that have Macs in the business center... I forgot to print up some forms and was lucky that the printer was full of paper..."}
{"text":"Good hotel. Unfortunately Someone in the room next to us were smoking and my husband is allergic. They handled the situation and when we got back to our hotel the smell and people were gone. Leaving tomorrow; back to LA. Overall a good stay so far."}
{"text":"Ok so the location of the hotel is great. Rooms are big a spacious and their gym is perfect. HOWEVER I had to go to the front lobby 3x times because the room key was not working. It's got super annoying that after the 4x we just sat outside our room until someone actually came up to our room and just open it.  We also asked the guy at the front what are some activities we can do in Scottsdale and he didn't sound like he wanted to help much but whatever.   The pool area is not the best. Jacuzzi supper small if there is more than 3 people in it , it can get awkward.  So we just sat at the small bar area outside.   So after getting back home - there were multiple charges on my card for no reason 3 separate transactions that I had no idea what they were charging for.   A bit disappointing but at the same time does the job"}
{"text":"This hotel was a great venue to hold a wedding reception. There was plenty of parking, service appeared to have run smoothly, and the setting is beautiful. It was also convenient that we chose to take up the couple's wedding block deal and just stayed here for the weekend too.  Service from the hotel overall was meh. Most times when I was carrying luggage in and out no one opened the front door, other guests we knew had to contend with broken toilets, malfunctioning sinks, and room changes. Maybe these mechanical issues will be resolved once they're done painting (and renovating?) part of the second floor, I'm not sure. The pool was nice, though, and it's a pretty good location within reasonable driving of some good source of food and shopping."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this Hilton.  My room is beyond hot.  Walking in from the hall is like walking into a sauna.  Maintenance came and said it was working fine but still so hot.  Want to happy hour at Blue Fire grill and was basically ignored by the wait staff.  Took 75 minutes to get a glass of wine and hummus plate.   Ordered a dessert to take back of room.  Got bill, waited 20 minutes of being ignored more, scratched cost off of bill and left.  Will never return to this resort"}
{"text":"Just recently stayed at this hotel. The outside of this hotel is very charming. Just like everything else in AZ the building is brown. Staff was extremely sweet, breakfast is your standard Hilton breakfast with extras on the menu. The pool is big with a full bar. Very nice! Although it is sweltering in AZ I did try out the jacuzzi, very relaxing. The room we stayed in lacked natural light..no windows just French style doors to open (that you can actually go out of to access the pool area) the room felt to dark. There is also a sitting area outside of the French doors from your room, nice and quiet but I missed having a window!"}
{"text":"My daughters and I recently stayed at the hotel for the weekend. We found it to be lovely! The service really stood out the most. The pool area was where we really relaxed and enjoyed the ambience. Our room was comfortable and clean. We would definitely return to stay here in the future!!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel. Yes there are a couple of minor issues such as the noise factor, but the hotel was obviously built in the 70's. Overall, very responsive staff for what is available."}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite Phoenix hotels. I do love it here. The staff is amazing, the rooms are great and the fitness center is one of the nicest I've seen.   As with nearly all hotels, I hate how cramped the restroom are. You can barely sit on the toilet if the door is open and you cannot shower with the door open at all.   The only other issue I have is that the fan in the rooms can't be adjusted. I prefer it on all the time when I'm sleeping and thats not possible.   However, I keep returning because its a great place in a great location with a great staff. And they have complimentary valet."}
{"text":"This is the third time we stayed in the Villas. Have not slept through the night once. We have had three different people next door. Walls are paper thin. Tomorrow I buy ear plugs. No maid service today either day or evening. The internet is spotty. The sound bar on the main tv does not work. Very hard to understand. Bedroom tvs are much better. If someone cooks in the kitchen in the unit next door the smell comes through the kitchen vents. First two days the room smelled like toast and bacon. I drove to the pool in the main building. I circled the entire building twice. No parking spaces because of a conference. Came back to the villas. On Easter the hotel put out a beautiful candy display. I went to take a candy bar and a voice yelled out candy is for the kids! Like I was doing something wrong. I told him then put up a sign. I have stayed at other hotels where they will put out something special on a holiday for everyone. In the past there were cookies in the lobby. Now they claim they put them out at 5. We are back in the Villas by then and go out to dinner."}
{"text":"Abby helped us check into a Villa and was amazing!  She helped us get a great location, explained all of our options and genuinely helped our trip be the best it can be.  Our second day at the Villa she sent over chocolate covered strawberry's on a gorgeous tray which said \"Happy Birthday.\"  Amazing she remembered and a super personal touch.  Breakfasts and waiter Leo was so helpful, food was great.  They offer a shuttle service to local areas and they were super flexible, we would definitely stay again.  One of the best Hilton experiences I have had!"}
{"text":"Food sucks! Staff is ok but don't ask them for help at finding places or suggestions on what & where to go. Their spa is a joke and you're better off going to any other place because it's not a full spa. Only massages and the massages were terrible. When you tell your masseuse to go lighter and specifically told them light pressure, they ignore you to the point where now you're in pain. The pools are tiny and forget getting to the pool by 12 because at 3 pm the trees create too much shade to enjoy. Pool is NOT heated just everything with this place was off. I rented a villa and the toilets had urine all over them, carpets had food on them that weren't obviously vacuumed, and cobwebs on the ceilings. When calling the front desk, you may as well forget getting through to someone because no one answers. I will not be returning & would rather stay in the desert with the snakes rather then stay here! As for the videos of the garbage & dirty linens left outside, it was put out there on Wednesday morning, at 10:07pm that same day, it was still left out there. Then I got up at 6:30am Thursday morning & the garbage & dirty linens were still there! I also saw the housekeeping take the dirty water from steam cleaning the carpets & throw the dirty water on top of the plants & cactus' right next to the door of the room they were cleaning. Now it smells so horrible like sewer water!! I also spoke to another guest who stayed in the villas like myself and she said there was old gum on her nightstand next to the bed & her feet were black from the dirty carpets! She has a child too young to chew gum & she would've never did something like that. It just goes to show you that this hotel obviously doesn't clean well! I'm only staying here because the hotels that we wanted to book had no vacancies. I just can't wait to leave!"}
{"text":"We recently had a conference at this hotel. I'd have to say that the hotel is OK. Nothing special and nothing too bad about this place. The hotel rooms are nice and I didn't have any issues. The room and bathroom was clean and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  One thing that I didn't like about the hotel is that the hotel is not layed out very well. It was a hike to get from the hotel lobby to our room, which was only on the 2nd floor but on the otherside of the building. The cookies that they offered was a nice touch, but by the end of the afternoon, there was not a huge selection left.   At night, I also went around looking for a vending machine. There are signs everywhere that display an ice vending machine and drinks (which I assumed would have been a pop machine), but after walking around both floors and only finding an ice machine, I called the front desk to ask about the location of a vending machine. They told me that there was not a vending machine on site and that they could deliver pop to my room if I wanted. (yea right, I was not about to order a pop for $4 and then have to pay tax and gratuity).   Just make sure that if you want something to drink, make sure you buy it elsewhere before arriving at the hotel. They do not have a store on site where you can buy it either.   Overall, the stay was pleasant and I did not have any complaints about the room or cleanliness of the hotel."}
{"text":"We came to this resort for one night. Jennifer M. At the front desk was awesome. She greeted us with a smile and was very attentive to our requests. She gave us a delightful pool view room and made us feel like valued customers. Much to our surprise we had a knock on our door in the evening with a note from Jennifer and a tray of Chocolate covered strawberries!! The hotel is on a great location and you should definitely make a reservation for SumoMaya restaurant across the street for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm typically a Marriott girl, so staying at a Hilton was a stretch! I must say, even though the price was better here, I would still pay more for a Marriott property. The front desk receptionist didn't even know how to get back to the Villas, where we were staying. The Villa itself is nice, but that's about where it ends. Food at the restaurant is good; there is better elsewhere in Scottsdale. It is conveniently located though; and you can walk to The Good Egg in the strip mall adjacent. (Also - try Humble Pie!). The friendliest people there were the concierge (great golf recommendations) and the night person at the desk, who gladly split our bill between two couples. I wouldn't stay here again, unless it was another great deal."}
{"text":"No revolving doors at hotel so certainly not conducive for carrying luggage.  Nice staff at check in. Room decent size. A/C broken, had to request a box fan. Checked out a day early due to A/C and they still insisted on charging me $125 early check out. I explained why we were leaving and they stated that it was basically my fault bc i turned the thermostat down too low and froze the unit."}
{"text":"This past weekend was our first family trip to Scottsdale. We arrived into AZ about 10am, I called to see if we could do early check in and unfortunately the rooms weren't ready. That was fine, when we did check in we got a nice room with a patio. The patio was a shared patio with a view the pool. The bathroom was really small but, other than that it was a fairly nice sized room. The bedding was comfortable. The furniture was not dated and I didn't hear my neighbors through the thin walls as I had previously read. There is free valet parking so on days like Saturday afternoon when the lot was completely full; you just hand your keys over to valet and walk on into the hotel.  The only true negative is the restaurant inside the hotel is really pricey. The continental breakfast was $18 pp and $9 for a 2 y/o, I mean really what 2 year old eats $9 worth of food? Certainly not mine. I'm lucky if she finishes a complete bowl of cereal so dining there was out of the question.  The pool area and lobby were my favorite part of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and  nicely decorated. The pool has a toddler pool which more hotels should make. My little love had an great time splish splashing with the other toddlers. I felt beyond comfortable. They keep the outside pool area stocked with pool towels and plenty of water. While I'm talking about the pool there is a hostess/waitress that comes by the pool and takes food and drink orders. Very attentive, amazing! The bar prices weren't steep at all. You have an option of charging it to your room or paying.  I'm definitely a fan and we will stay here again. Maybe after we stay at the Double Tree! They have a free breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"This hotel was very presentable and nice. The service were very helpful. The pool area is very nice as is the restaurant, and breakfast area. The workout room was not a full gym but you could still get a good workout in. You can even rent beach cruiser bikes, which are cool.  THE UGLY: I don't know if it was the room I was in or what but I have never in my life stayed in a room that was so noisy. I had many meetings lined up which require a clear head and a good nights rest which I did not get. All night long it sounded like the walls were going to fall apart, and the roof was going to cave in. I'm not talking about your normal cracks and creeks I'm talking full on loud construction type noises. At times it was like a window being slammed shut over and over again. Needless to say I was very unhappy.  After the second day if this (thinking day 1 was a fluke or something) I informed the guy as I checked out about the noises. His responses were less then what I would consider hilton standards but in a nut shell he told me the noises were from temperature changes and having a wooden roof.   What ever the reason I would not recommend staying here until they get a new roof or some other type fix."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews.  Overall this resort is a disappointment.  It's just ok.  Just ok.  Expect more from the Hilton name."}
{"text":"This resort sits in the heart of Scottsdale and is conveniently accessible to the shopping malls and decent restaurants. It's showing its age but still not too bad. The only thting I don't like is their room insulation. The first day that we stayed there were bunch of drunk people talking loud after midnight, they sounded like talking right by your ears! I complained to the front desk and they said all the rooms are like that!"}
{"text":"Big and nicely decorated. The staff is supper nice and helpful. So far all the food I have tried has been good. Only thing that's a little disappointing is that there is no refrigerator in my room. An even with the air conditioner set to 70° it's still 84° in the room and a little stuffy. The WiFi is a little slow if it even works. But for the most part it's a nice place to chill in. The pool is refreshing."}
{"text":"Decided at the last minute to book a room for the weekend in Scottsdale for the weekend birthday celebratory of a great friend. Since we have points with Hilton, this resort was a no-brainer. It's close to Old Town; cool restaurants; Fleming's Steakhouse is attached and that is always a win-win; there's a nice gym; infused water; nice decor and on-the-spot room service. The pool could be larger and it's filled with children; a renovation to that would be a plus, give them their space and the adults their own, too. But, lots of shade and umbrellas, even on a 112* day. The pool bar is hit and miss. The first guy, Alex, is amazing. He was alone running the pool bar and serving the pool guests at their loungers; very nice, attentive and eager to please. The next guy, complete polar opposite! David could learn from Alex! David doesn't do friendly! In fact, David is down right rude. I would say renovate the pool & add some cabanas for rent; another pool bar or at least some help for Alex , ( but not David :) ) ; and add some more options on the late night room service menu which goes : desserts; coffees/teas/alcohols; kids menu . But, it's still a solid 4 star for me because all else was done so well. From valet to check in, to breakfast delivery to dinner to concierge services . Good job Hilton"}
{"text":"Let's start with 3.5 stars..... We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday night. My husband ran into the lobby to grab a wheelchair to wheel me to my room. The front desk man was very reluctant to allow my husband to use the wheelchair. After some convincing, the man finally found a rickety half broken chair for us to use.   Our first room was on the 3rd floor. Very clean, spacious, smelled good, pool view. But about every 20-30 mins the ceiling would make a terrible creaking noise as if it were settling. Yep, we had to listen to that alllll night. The next morning my husband asks for us to be changed to a room on the 2nd floor. After about 8 more hours of the creaking the front desk called and said they had a 2nd floor room ready. My husband went Down to get the room key and a luggage cart. The bellman would NOT Allow my husband to take a luggage cart, even though they knew we were moving one floor. The excuse was they didn't have enough for him to take one and they had to do it themselves. That was irritating. So instead We just made two trips to move the luggage to the 2nd floor ourselves.   The room again was clean and smelled clean and had a good looking view although this floor is noisy with rude people showing no kindness when letting the doors close or using inside voices.   We are Hilton Honors members, we love staying at Hiltons all over the country, but this has not been our favorite experience. The staff is sub par and the customers who stay here aren't courteous when walking down the hall at all hours of the night.   Can't say we would stay here again. The rooms are clean and comfortable with great beds and pillows but that doesn't make up for a not so kind staff and loud patrons."}
{"text":"Checked in at 9:30 am & they had no rooms available. They wouldn't, not couldn't, look up my company's Hilton Honors account to apply it to my room at check in. Had to wait in a very empty lobby for quite some time for a room to be ready. I travel every week for work, this has been the worst check in experience ever."}
{"text":"We were here for a convention which was all day in this Hilton. The hotel is dated, but the pool appears updated and the conference room is small for about 200 people. I didn't think this place was spectacular and was glad to have booked the Hyatt to stay."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Scottsdale Hilton in one of their villas for New Years Eve. It was the perfect size for all of us staying there and it was close to where we were going to be in Scottsdale.  The villa had it's own kitchen fully equipped with a fridge, stove, sink and even had cups and glasses. There was a little seating area by the kitchen as well.  The bedrooms were both a good size and the master bedroom had a huuuuuge bathroom. It also had his and her's sink and tons of space. I was sad that I didn't get to use the shower because it was a walk-in shower and was spacious.  There was also a larger sitting area with a tv and fireplace and it also had a pull out bed from the couch. I recommend getting a villa if you will be sharing the space with a few people as there is tons of room!  To get to the block party we were going to, we called taxis and the Hilton also sent over shuttles to get us to and from. They weren't charging but did ask for tips. They were really easy to communicate with since we had so many people and they did an awesome job!  My only complaint is that some of the outlets in the bathroom and the room didn't work. It wasn't too big of a deal since I found one that worked that was luckily by a mirror so I could do my hair, haha. Other than that, our short stay at the Hilton was great and I wish we could have gotten more use out of the villa."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception there, and the service was terrible. My guests staying at the hotel did not like the rooms either, they could hear whats happening next door."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a good 5-night stay at this property. The room was kept clean, it seemed like the moment we left the room, it would be cleaned before we got back no matter how fast we returned.  The resort actually did have a little tropical vacation feel to it with the palm trees around the good size pool and a separate spa/workout center.  It was a nice workout facility (free weights/treadmill with personal tv) although it got a little warm in there.   The pool stayed busy all weekend. Actually, we didn't even get in the water because when we thought about it, it just looked too busy to bother.  They have a spot for a fire pit, but it was never on and when we asked about it the front desk didn't seem to know about it.    The hotel is in a nice, safe location. We were definitely satisfied with picking this side of town for our Phoenix visit.  Overall, it was a good choice and we had a nice stay. I had left a brand new shirt in the closet and after a few calls was able to speak with someone and they were able to send me my shirt which i gladly paid for since it was cheaper than buying a new one."}
{"text":"If you come here to eat breakfast because an old friend is in town for the day, here's some advice; DON'T. Service doesn't even aspire toward bad. In fact, the service ranks so far down on the bad scale, it can't be measured. I't like that movie...The Abyss. Food was decent, but nothing to make your shorts wet.  And you know those dollar sign symbols indicating how pricey the joint?  Well this place should have a small picture of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg gathered inside  the bullion room at Fort Knox for some kind of ceremonial \"Were rich, bitches'  circle jerk, prominently displayed somewhere on the menu.  This place not only sucks balls, it does so with such tremendous wind tunnel force, it swooshes them down whole, where they lodge in the back of your throat, jamming up your glottal stop, preventing you from making the UH-OH sound upon seeing your bill."}
{"text":"Came here for a real estate income event \"Make Money with Income Properties\" - the event was in the Grand Ballroom.  The hotel/resort is located in a busy area of Scottsdale.  It's easy to find - nice signage and they offer valet, but there is plenty of parking available as well.    The facility is clean, modern, aesthetically pleasing, etc.  It did seem to be a bit understaffed though as there was not many people available to ask questions to other than the front desk associates.  The seminar here was blah, and they misleadingly advertised a complimentary dinner w/ the seminar.  The so-called seminar was nothing more than a means to get you signed up for a $1000+ seminar ... I didn't really learn anything significant and having to wait for food when your hungry was no fun.  The complimentary dinner offer was very deceiving - it turned out to be a boxed lunch w/ a turkey sandwich, Apple, brownie, and pasta salad .... I was hungry and not in the mood for a cold sandwich for dinner, so after being handed this joke of a dinner - we left immediately.    I would go back to the hotel again, but beware of this seminar .... It's wasn't bad, but not quite what I was expecting ...."}
{"text":"Came to this hilton late tonight after a horrible experience at another hotel that caused us to pack up and immediately leave.  The Hilton Scottsdale staff were amazing as we checked in. They were quick and offered us water because we obviously looked like we had a rough night. Got to our room which was great despite this being a last minute reservation.  Once in our room we immediately had a knock on the door, it was room service sending up a kind note and gift from the front desk ( Colette, Jen and Anthony).  It made all the hassle of moving so worth it and we will be returning to this Hilton since we come to Scottsdale every year for our wedding anniversary. Thank you Colette, Jen and Anthony for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get away in your in the Scottsdale, Arizona area, and you don't even need to have a room to do it.  The Hilton Scottsdale offers a 'Resort Day Pass', so you can enjoy all benefits of being at a resort, without having to pay for overnight accommodations.  On top of that, they offer poolside cabanas!  So you can get the day pass, and then rent a cabana for the day.  Depending on which one you choose, your cabana can accommodate 4-6 people, couple of couches, a set number of non-alcoholic drinks, fruit basket, ceiling fan, electrical outlet, and some even have TVs.  Once you're there, you can pretend your on a resort vacation, enjoying the pool, sunshine, poolside food and drink service, workout gym, spa (for an additional fee) and more.  We were on vacation visiting a friend, and decided it would be great to spend the day by the pool and relax.  The Hilton Scottsdale was a perfect choice for us."}
{"text":"I'm not one to hate on hotels nor give them bad reviews, but after our most recent stay, I can confidently say that I do not plan to return anytime soon. I am a frequent traveler and have stayed in several hotels - I even stayed in this one 4 times, with each stay getting progressively worse than the previous one. I first visited this hotel in December 2015, and that visit was near seamless: the staff was friendly, the food was great, rooms were nice, and everything functioned properly.  However, each time we visited since then (twice a year - once in December and once in June), things went downhill. In June 2016, the restaurant changed and food quality declined. It was still good, but not nearly as good as the time before. We were also there over the summer, so it was pretty hot, and the air conditioner broke in our room. We were there for five nights, and the first two nights we were in a room with unrepairable (at the time) air conditioning, so we had to switch rooms.  It was evident that the hotel was making tons of budget cuts when we visited in December 2016. Every day, the hotel puts out cookies at around check-in time (4 PM). However, on this trip, cookies were generally put out every other day, and sometimes these cookies were not freshly made - they were leftover from the day before or pre-packaged cookies. Additionally, the hotel had gotten rid of on-demand movies and mini-bars. The only TV we were able to watch was live TV, and there was no guide so we could not see what was playing at a certain time. Other than this, our overall experience was not bad.  It was our most recent visit, June 2017, that was one of the most stressful stays at a hotel I've ever encountered. When we first went to our room, we noticed that our TV was dim. Almost too dim to see in the dark. We called maintenance the next day, and there was nothing that they were able to do. It also took them nearly two hours to appear in our room. Additionally, housekeeping began slacking on making the beds. The sheets on the beds weren't even covering the entire mattress. Also, the vents in the room had a TON of dust in them, especially the ones in the bathroom. It was quite disgusting. Also, food quality continued declining, but so did service. One day, we ordered up a bakery basket (pastries) for breakfast, and it came with a variety of about 8 pastries. The next day, we ordered two of them, and we got 8 pastries total, many of which were low quality and clearly store-bought. When we called down to ask why we got less, the man who was assisting us clearly forgot to put the phone on hold, as we heard him say \"está loca\", which means \"s/he is crazy\" in Spanish. This was in reference to my mom, whom I was staying with. She was the one who called down. Another basket was sent up to the room, but we politely declined, which was followed by an eye roll of the delivery lady. When we spoke to the front desk about it, they didn't seem to really care. The manager said that he spoke with the staff about the issue, and he took their word for what happened (that this man didn't say anything and that if he did it was not in reference to us). We were offered no compensation for any of our troubles. Additionally, when we tried to order room service one day, we were told that someone called in and removed the card on file and changed it to cash. My grandparents (who made the reservation) always keep a card on file, so this does not make any sense whatsoever. My grandmother consulted the front desk and it was revealed that it was caused by a typo in entering the credit card and a malfunctioning computer system. This wasn't the only system glitch either. We were told that we would be charged the lowest available rate, which, at the time, was $87/night for five nights. However, we were initially quoted $119/night. The temporary authorization charge ended up being $119/night for seven nights. (Our original stay was planned for five nights). Due to these issues, we were, in fact, offered breakfast vouchers and a $50 meal credit.  While there is a ton that is negative about this hotel, there are some positive aspects. Firstly, the location is perfect. It is near several amazing restaurants and malls. Secondly, the pool is very nice. It is clean, deep, and large. Thirdly, the cookies are delicious, when they are baked fresh and put out on time, if at all. Fourth, despite the issues, the rooms are spacious and quite comfortable. And finally, the design of the resort is great. It looks much better on the inside and outside than other hotels in the area (in comparison to comparable hotels). It also has a warm and inviting feel.  Overall, if things were as seamless as the first visit we had, I'd have no trouble giving this resort five stars. In fact, I looked forward to visiting it again after we left. However, I am forced to give it two stars after our recent unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"We spent a recent weekend in Scottsdale for a weekend getaway, planned last minute. It's blazing hot in August so most hotels were offering low rates.  I went out of my usual comfort zone and booked the Hilton Scottsdale through a Hotwire rate without knowing the property name. It had 95% approval so I assumed it would be safe. Our rate was super low so it's hard to complain.  We arrived on a Friday evening around 8 PM and the property is about 20 minutes from PHX Airport. It's located in North Scottsdale but very close to the posh Paradise Valley. I think Paradise Valley, while lesser known than Scottsdale, is much prettier.   To start, the Hilton is an older property. It's late 80s, early 90s decor peeks through. However, some updates have been made. Dated decor aside, the property is very clean and well maintained. The rooms are very comfortable with soft sheets and nice beds. The bathroom was a bit small though and the door almost touched the toilet.  The pool area is nice with cabanas available to reserve and lots of fresh towels available so you don't have to bring them from your room. I appreciated that the property and pool area are very quiet so if you want to avoid a loud bunch, the Hilton is a good choice.  Some things I didn't like were the WiFi that is only free if you book through Hilton.com (I'm an HHonors member) and the outdoor restaurant by the pool had awful service.  Overall, I'm stuck between 3 and 4 stars on the Hilton but I'm going with 4 due to the friendly staff all around. We had a good weekend stay and the Hilton served well as a nice resting spot during our Scottsdale visit."}
{"text":"I should have looked on Yelp first.... Cheap hotel that reminds me of a rode hard / put away wet airport hotel with tired decor, tired rooms, and the only redeeming quality is a decent bed.    I really expected more, given the area."}
{"text":"I stayed in Scottsdale for two nights during a recent work trip. My company arranges our travel, so they chose the Scottsdale Hilton for me. I read Yelp reviews a few days before my trip and was a little concerned that I was going to be walking into smells or loud noises, as per other guest reviews, but my own experience was nothing like that.   The front desk concierge was extremely helpful upon checking me in, and even moved my room from a handicap accessible one (thanks, work) to one that was near the pool (at my request). They gave me a map of the resort, which was cute, and I then drove to my room (I didn't have to valet park, but when I pulled up to check-in, the valet was really nice and personable, which is always a plus).   The room was a typical hotel room, nothing out of the ordinary, but the bed was comfortable and everything was clean. The TV had very limited channels, and unfortunately a few of them didn't work, which was a bummer.   The pool was lovely, as was the pool bar Oasis. I ordered a margarita each time I visited the pool, though they seemed to be prepared differently depending on who was making them (one looked like lemonade and didn't taste like any liquor at all, the other was very strong). Relaxing by the pool was wonderful though, and some of the hotel staff came around with their strawberry infused water as well as Rice Krispie treats, which was a adorable (and the man who came out was SO sweet and attentive to all the guests, which was a huge plus).   All in all, I had a good experience at the Hilton and would definitely return. The room is typical and the TV was frustrating, but most likely if you're in Scottsdale, you're not there to spend a lot of time watching TV in your room. The staff was absolutely wonderful and more than made up for any slight problems, and the location of the hotel is also perfect, right on the main strip with so many restaurants and things to do within walking distance."}
{"text":"Very nice property....but very dated. They could compensate with awesome service, but service was only ok. The location was nice. Easy drive to Giants Spring Training. Great parking. Pool is nice, but how about a little service out there?  Would probably come back, but I think there are a lot of other properties that might be comparable or better."}
{"text":"Alright so when I called to confirm my reservation I was greeted by an extremely rude front desk person named Jeff. He was short with me, had a rude tone, and lacked any semblance  of customer service. I almost cancelled my reservation right then. When I checked in Saturday  I was greeted by Abby. Who was so sweet. She got to know me, gave me directions to my room, and was funny and kind. I only stayed one night for bachelorette festivities..the room.was beautiful, quiet, and well cleaned. The valet.was wonderful when I checked in at 12, young personable guy and we talked college football. Overall minus Jeff the customer service was exceptional. Would stay again!"}
{"text":"My first time in Arizona with my friends. We checked in this hotel, I don't like how they treat customers. The receptionist are not welcoming and not knowledgeable enough. I don't recommend this hotel to my friends. They will only be disappointed."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a mini weekend vacation.  Tried to check in early yesterday but room wasn't ready.  So I went to run my errands then ate.  I didn't get my room til almost 3p.  As a lifetime Diamond member, I requested for a room upgrade but they were booked out.  The room I got was huge anyways so no complaints here.  As soon as I got settled, went to run errands again.  Came back around 7p to relax before I head out again.  I was thankful beyond words with a turndown service I received while I was gone.  Abby left me a romantic treat - wine, fruits and snacks!  If I knew she was going to do that, I would have not ordered a fruit treat and melted chocolates from Edible Arrangements.  Didn't get back til past midnight.  Couldn't open the wine so just went to sleep.  I couldn't thank Abby enough!  When I called, I told her thanks for the excellent service.  Stopped by at the front desk to thank her again.  Abby deserve more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stayed here on business since it was off-season and the rate ($109) was attractive. I usually like the Homewood with its free beer.  Beautiful entrance and lobby. My room wasn't quite ready so they comped me for two drinks at one of the two bars on site. The site is fairly spread out so I agree with JD...if you don't like to walk a quarter mile to your room, park near one of the other entrances.  Room was clean and roomy, although for two nights, I was awoken .... awakened  ... woken up... aroused... by this loud creaking in the ceiling above me. Thought I was back at my Mom's house when my older brothers would try to sneak in after curfew. Brand new flat screen was recently installed.  Housekeeping did a nice job.  Fitness center was fairly appointed but major gripe... it doesn't open until 6am.  For an East Coast guy here on business and in the office at 5am AZ time, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The worst customer service ever. Would not stay at another Hilton as long as live."}
{"text":"After spending a few days in Sedona, with hours of driving, I couldn't wait to get to Scottsdale and just enjoy some pool time. I booked the hotel on the Hilton website during their 25% off sale so I got a pretty good rate for my recent June visit. Along with the free wi-fi, my friend and I also were able to take advantage of their free breakfast since I'm a HH gold member. They normally charge $24 for that so that saved us almost $50/day but you do have to tip.   The check in process was fine. They didn't offer me any room upgrades even though I had gold status. When I mentioned it, they only had an upgrade to a pool view room. That wasn't very impressive to me so I said forget it. The original room we got had non-working air conditioning. I called the lobby and they sent a technician right away to assess the problem. He told us there was a problem with the main cooling system and he wouldn't be able to fix it. They quickly moved us to another room (an upgraded pool view room) but honestly not worth the extra price if you were to actually pay for it. Otherwise, the hotel provides Peter Thomas Roth toiletries which I LOVED. Everything smelled so divine!   It was over 110 deg when I was staying in Scottsdale, so the pool was a must. They had an abundance of towels and had a water cooler to combat the heat. There was also a nice waitress from the pool side restaurant that actually brought us iced water during my morning tanning session. An extra nice touch. Overall, I enjoyed my time at the location and would consider it again for the price if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"We didn't have the problems that all the others seemed to have with the thin walls and noise factor.  In fact, I thought the rooms were rather quiet! Our biggest complaint was the bathroom toilet..  It kept sticking so we had to hold down the lever so it worked properly.  That was a serious pain in the arse!  The PROS:  Crabtree & Evelyn toiletry ~ super comfy bed ~ free wifi ~ decent breakfast foods that aren't too pricey..  Also, I really liked the outdoor bar near the pool.  I grabbed a few drinks there nightly and they give you complimentary bottled water on request..  We all know that bottled H20 is EXPENSIVE at hotels, so this was grrrreat!  Appetizers are also served until late night, but they're just mediocre.  Now, the CONS:  again the toilet, and the lack of ventilation in the bathroom which gets super foggy after a shower.  This hotel is conveniently located and you can walk to a ton of cool restaurants and even a Trader Joes..    IMO, it's a 3.5 to 4 star resort that could use some minor upgrades but i would definitely stay here again!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place. The staff has been really nice, the room is VERY clean, like, even the GROUT is clean as a whistle. Housekeeping arranged my toiletries carefully on a new towel so they could clean the vanity, very sweet. Room service was fast, correct, and tasty.  The pool area is beautiful.  The drinks at the pool bar worried me a bit, the ice tastes... Funky. The best way I can put it. I stuck to wine after that. The other mentions of the ceiling issues are 100% true. Oddly- it's ONLY at night, like dead in the middle of the night. It woke me with a jolt. It is scary, I'll give you that. The bathroom is very small but one inside with the door closed, I had no problem. I'd stay again on business, but there are better choices for pleasure."}
{"text":"Time for a review update.  The two main reasons I visit this hotel is to dine at Fleming's and to attend conferences.  Conferences are perfect for this hotel because the parking for the meeting space is in the back where the ballroom is located, so it's an easy in/out parking situation.  The banquet staff is experienced and do a good job taking care of attendees.  The banquet food here is good too.  Fleming's is awesome as usual.  Separate review for them...but in short, they have a great happy hour and awesome Steaks.  Besides that, all of my comments from my last review still apply.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the villas are at this Hilton facility! The rooms are nice sizes, the kitchen was full service, with everything I could possibly need or want, including washer and dryer. The resort itself is just absolutely beautiful and so nicely maintained. The service at check-in as well as in the restaurant was outstanding. I didn't mind that I needed to drive from my villa to the hotel restaurant, main pool, and fitness center (could have walked, but nah!). I would absolutely recommend these Hilton villas if you are going to Phoenix/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The room was spacious and clean.  The staff at the front counter is friendly and helpful.  Perfect for a business meeting place.  Would have given it 4 stars but the bartenders were slow and almost rude in their behavior."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has less than 4 stars! Clearly most people only go to Yelp to complain so I figured I'd give a positive review!!   Hotel is gorgeous and has all the amenities! We stayed in the Villas (remodeled in Dec 2015) and LOVED IT! Especially for the price which is an amazing value considering it could sleep up to 8 people!! They are further from the main hotel but not that far for anyone who isn't lazy. BUT you can call the front desk and a shuttle will pick u up and take you to the hotel. The Villas are directly behind the \"Hilton Village\" which has great restaurants, shops, juice bar, CVS, and a Starbucks! There is also a gate on the furthest end from the Villas that takes you directly to the shops. The villas also has their own small pool but main hotel pool is a lot bigger, nicer and has the food service.   The staff was also amazing and friendly. We made sure to take care of the ladies who cleaned our suite because they took care of us and were so fast! The villas also have a washer/dryer in them which is great if u have kids!   All in all great stay and I'm so glad I picked this place!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel, but definitely dated. Rooms are nice, but you can hear EVERYTHING through the adjoining door to room next door. It was a nice touch when I checked in that there was jazz playing in the room and a fruit plate. My boss was upgraded to a villa, and those are lovely, and quiet. I had a baby next door that woke me up at 4 each day, so I can't say that I would recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"It is hard for me to write negative reviews, but this one was easy!  The price was expensive and the hotel was cheap.  Long walk to room and the bed was not that comfortable. When I asked about getting a discount for military, I was informed that we were lucky to be getting it at $169. because they usually charge $250 and it is high season in Scottsdale.  Then they charge you for everything! But it was especially annoying to be told that if I just checked email, I would be charged $10.00.  Got nachos from the outside patio and they were filled with gristle and fat. Yuck.  We were supposed to stay for three nights and we moved to  the Best Western Superstition Springs Inn and Suites and had a wonderful room and a great breakfast for 89.99.  I was going to just chalk it up except I just received an email from their customer service department and   Dave Horton Global Head - Hilton Hilton Hotels  I decided he was a day late and a dollar short asking if we were happy there. Perhaps the staff should have mentioned to him that we asked for tea bags and they were going to charge us! Gimme a break.  It was noisy in the rooms at night as well as the conference rooms during the day.  I am going to write a glowing report on the Best Western Superstition Springs Inn, so watch for that one.  Then you will know that I am usually a nice person who is easy to get along with."}
{"text":"Good Location. Rooms are under average quality for a Hilton. Pool is good size and clean, and they keep a good amount of clean towels. Good Value if you find a deal online. Parking and Wifi was free."}
{"text":"A pretty decent hotel-but have to agree with the noise factors.  Could hear everyone in the hallways in the morning (including screaming kids).  The poolside patio upgrade was not bad but you share the patio with another room.  Breakfast buffet at the Bluefire was ok but not spectaular.  Dinner is somewhat better.  Don't order the shrimp cocktail though-  you get 3 small shrimp stuck in a lemon with a toothpick, then they smear cocktail sauce on a long plate and charge like 14 or 16 bucks or something. Lame!!  You can eat outside but watch out for the birds hanging out-I actually had one fly onto my plate and steal some bread.  Scared the crap outta me lol.  Ballsy little guys!!  They do have some good hh deals on a few apps, beer, and house wine.  It definetly lacked in the accessibilty of ice machines and having vending machines.  Service was above average in all areas but the hotel itself was a little disapointing."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed in my stay at this hotel. The weekend I stayed here the power went out and I stayed in a room where the lock on the door was broken without my knowledge! Anyone could push open the door without the key! Being that I'm a single traveler I'm disgusted and it made me feel unsafe I will never stay here again. If you plan to stay here make sure to check the rooms beforehand!!"}
{"text":"My first time staying at a Hilton hotel and my last.  Beds were squeaky, ceilings creaked off and on.  Reservations were mixed up.  No bartender at the inside bar and poolside bar was hit and miss with it's service.  Employees seemed somewhat confused.  No free wifi, had to be a member.  Refrigerate was called a cooler not a refrigerator.  Had to pay 10 dollars to get a refrigerator.  Over all it was ok but not what was expected.  This hotel needs a major over haul."}
{"text":"I stay at Hiltons 15+ times a year and this resort five or so times over the past couple of years. The resort and pool are BEAUTIFUL and the food is pretty decent. Rooms are always very clean.   With that said the customer service I received from Abby was absolutely horrid today. She was short with me from the moment I approached the desk, wouldn't assist in finding alternate solutions to my problems and got frustrated almost immediately. She was a terrible representation of customer service. Especially from the Hilton which I have always found to have friendly helpful reps.   After having the request Collette, the manager, myself for resolution we determined there was actually a very easy solution. So thank you! Wish it didn't have to get to a manager to fix something so simple.   Will definitely reconsider staying at this resort in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  Way more than 5 stars. My husband and I stayed here for part of the week during his buisness trip and we have never met more friendly or accommodating hotel staff!  Everyone was so cheery in the morning and even made us a fresh pot of coffee right before our departure.  Awesome food! The grill inside has the best shrimp gazpacho and drinks. Also check out the poolside grill. Yum. Our room was cleaned and refreshed daily, extremely clean and sheets were crisp!  Very nice all inclusive spot to stay in Scottsdale. Also close to everything and you can see some of the mountains from the resort!  We absolutely loved our stay and hope to be back soon!! Thank you staff!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before booking. The bathroom is really small, which wouldn't be a problem if the door opened towards the outside... The power plugs were loose in the bathroom and non-existent throughout the rest of the room.  We were there for two nights, and was never serviced. We traveled with our two dogs so i made sure to call the front desk to let them know when we would be out with the dogs so they could come and clean the room... I did that twice the same day, and was clearly unsuccessful.  I sent clothes to dry cleaning, and they were supposed to be ready by 9am the next morning... 11am nothing and we were already 2 hours behind schedule to hit the road. It took another 45 mins to get them and check-out. When I called to inquire about it, the lady at the front desk was as unpleasant as one can be.   I won't go back to this hotel."}
{"text":"Stayed in hotel and not villa. Nice big rooms. AC worked well. Shower was great. The staff was amazing. I would stay here again. It's very far from some tourist attractions. If tour a tourist I would stay closer to the north part of town it will save you an hour getting to the Grand Canyon"}
{"text":"Very Nice rooms  Decent bathrooms clean Great breakfast  Loud if your room will face the road  Breakfast stuff annoying and not paying attention to all tables  Front desk stuff nice  Great lobby  Worth the money"}
{"text":"I got a great deal on Priceline and was put in a nice, clean room on the ground floor. Great room service experience and decent desk service. Really my only complaint was that we called up to the desk to request a taxi. They said okay, and when we got to the front of the hotel someone shooed us to an unmarked SUV and then charged us a ridiculous amount ($15 plus tip) to drive TWO miles! The next day while checking out, I told the desk person that I was really annoyed about that, and then she proceeded to be annoyed by me complaining and said I had to SPECIFICALLY request a metered cab. That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I'm a local (well, 15 miles away in Phoenix anyway) and booked a room here for my friend's 36th birthday.  I was really excited about the place based on the website photos and description.  Arrive at the resort and there's only one person attending the front desk (no doorman in sight), and the directions I got to my room was a thumb  gesture towards the hallway.  The resort is set up like a giant square so, yes, eventually that hallway brought me to my room.  Room itself was fine, clean, the bed was comfortable, kind of expected a flat screen/HDTV but the room was equipped with one of those older tube models.  The walls were thin and you could pretty much hear everything in the rooms around  - including the bathrooms and TVs.   The pool area was fine - not amazing, just fine - which was a little disappointing given the room rate for the Saturday night stayover.  Had dinner at Flemings, attached to the hotel and that was most excellent...and convenient given the fact that with cocktails and wine we could just walk back to the resort rather than risk taking a vehicle and end up in Sheriff Arpaio's tent city.  Which may have had thicker walls than this Hilton :-)  So overall, an okay place but probably will try something else when we go the \"staycation\" route and stay somewhere in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I stayed her last month for fall break with my daughters on a weekday.We had gotten a great mid week price $107  My room was spacious, clean, nice comfortable beds and  had a patio  with a pool view.   Warning: Do not accept the Honer Bar Key. Also there is no price list to go with it *unless you ask for them to  bring you a price menu. I did .  As always I open and inspect contents to be sure everything is there . It was missing  almost 4 mini bottles, a snack, and a few sodas. The gourmet candy bar I intended to eat was old and chalky white. They  sent someone to my room to  stock the fridge  properly and did say the replacement candy bar was on them.  I had only taken 2 sodas and a mini bottle from the Honor Bar. I then kept the key in a safe spot  for possible snack  pilferers ;)  We enjoyed the pool  and Jacuzzi and also ordered a few things from the poolside cabana bar . It was basic Chicken fingers for the kids and I did get a bleu cheese and beef \"bruschetta\" but  the cheese was overpowering and I feel a bit  past date as it actually bubbled in my mouth . They graciously took it off my bill  We had a nice time watched a few movies in the evening, Upon checkout I noticed I had been charged at the Cabana Bar 2 times for the food. It was fixed by the desk manager upon checkout and I  decided  has been a nice getaway. A few days later  I checked my bank statement and saw and extra $78 had been added to my bill total. I immediately called the hotel and  left a voice message regarding the extra charge with Billing. No return call  but Hilton Resorts  had sent me an email asking about my stay so I did put the question to them as to the extra charge and explained the mini fridge prob to them and that I had only used 3 items.. They must have taken care of the problem with Food and Beverage because the next day the charge was back to the correct amount .  I never did get a call from the Actual property with an explanation or apology.. I would stay here again because it was a nice resort  for a short stay, I just  wont say yes to the Bar key ;)"}
{"text":"I stayed on the first floor all the way toward the end at building 1 near the pool.   There was absolutely no view and I kept the curtains closed so I won't be displaying myself to the people near the pool.     The furniture was not \"new\" nor modern - but not so run-down.   The size of the room (2 double bed) was good and spacious.   The shower looked like from the 90s but kept pretty clean.   The housekeeping stuff really did a nice job.   The only problem that I had was the towels - which were really thin and probably endured a decade of cleaning.     The meeting rooms were nicely setup and had everything we needed.   They were located on the other side of the lobby and had to go \"outside\" to enter the meeting rooms.   The weather was nice when I was there so I had no problems with this kind of setup.  However, I just could not imagine how it would feel if we were there in the middle of the summer - a bit of funny setup that way.     I had a higher level in the Hilton Honor program but did not get the customary bottle water upon check-in.   As result, I had to make a run to a local CVS to pick up a few bottle water for my thirst after a long plane ride."}
{"text":"Hubby, kiddo and I stayed two nights while my husband attended a conference for work, in one of the ballrooms. It was a fine room - comfy beds and cool ac. The beds were super squeaky and it often sounded like somebody was running across the roof. The bathroom was small, but the shower water pressure was good. I did have to kill a roach in the bathroom...after housekeeping was there. Probably my biggest complaint is the restaurant. Because we didn't want to leave the property at lunchtime while on break from the conference, we ate at the hotel two times too many. Overpriced to the tune of a $5.50 iced tea. Also, it was just very mediocre. So for the three of us to eat lunch for $40 seemed ridiculous, especially since two of us shared and our daughter is three. Overall, it was ok. Everything was just ok. Probably wouldn't seek out this hotel again - we stayed here originally because of the conference."}
{"text":"I loved this hotel!   The lobby is beautiful and they made checking into the hotel easy and efficient. They also have an awesome business center with no limit on printing, definitely a win for the business traveler!   The room was also outstanding. It was large, spacious, and clean. The bed was also amazingly comfortable and I loved how they didn't have a nasty comforter on it. All hotels should take that tact.   I was supposed to stay here for two nights and was very disappointed I didn't have the opportunity to, it is a great hotel and if I am ever in Scottsdale again I'll be back."}
{"text":"Villa was really nice, big enough for a large family. Full use kitchen, laundry, two bedrooms, two bath, large living area. Bring your own food and save on gonig out.  The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors, if they are loud. Another downside was how far from the main hotel the Villas are located. If you wanted to use the main pool you would have to drive or walk. There is a pool area with the Villas, but was dirty and the water was a little green. In the 115 degree weather the A/C in the Villa was AWESOME. The A/C kept the Villa really comfortable and pleasent."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. This hotel was rude from the moment we walked in. And we made reservations a month and a half in advance and they didn't have our room ready for us and after clearly stating we called 2 different people to Make sure we could get The room we wanted, they still refused us that room . When we finally got our room it was dirty. DIRTY. At a Hilton. My bathroom had muddy shoe prints on the floor (I have pictures) and black hair covering the tub. The free breakfast was fine until I ate it and all the food was cold and soggy. The hot tub was so overly chlorinated that you couldnt sit in it without your eyes burning. And the customer service is just awful, especially at breakfast, they treated me like dirt until they realized I was a guest and then they just stared at us and wouldn't leave us alone after the be rude at breakfast. I wouldn't never stay here again. Even if they lowered rates to that of a days inn. I would rather be in a days in."}
{"text":"This hotel was picked due to locale (ease of getting too Scottsdale Stadium) and a good corporate rate.  Those two factors are all good. Our beef with this hotel is that the walls are too thin. Seriously consider your choices if you are a light sleeper, or, if you don't care to listen to other guests' conversations through the wall."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose to stay here this past weekend for our \"baby moon\" and I can tell you right now, I have not experienced better service in the US than I did here. Beyond the staff's friendliness and responsiveness, they provided us with above and beyond treatment. They shuttled us around Scottsdale and were very timely and prompt about it. Their breakfast was very good, poolside service too. The overall atmosphere might not impress some of the more \"posh\" people but in my opinion, it was an elegant and beautiful place while remaining humble.   When my wife and I return to Scottsdale it will be to the Hilton."}
{"text":"This hotel would be fine for a night. The hotel is clean, modern and has all the basics. But after four nights I have some suggestions for management: 1) Fix the windows so guests can open them.  2) free wifi with Hilton honors club only is a bit ridiculous in 2016.  3) it's great that you have nice desktops in your lobby...I used them often for work emergencies...but please add updated browsers (Chrome?) 4) When room service doesn't deliver an order for an hour and a half, a sincere apology would be appreciated.  5) Don't make your guests have to make another trip to the front desk to get a key to the minibar."}
{"text":"Simply put....weird hotel stay.  I booked a 1 king room.  We arrived at around 11pm, so a late arrival.  I checked in with my wife at we per placed in a room on the other side of the hotel.  We arrived into the room with two small beds.  They looked smaller then a set of doubles, maybe twins?  The room was clean.  But, the wooden roof squeeked and made strange sounds throughout the night.  My wife couldn't get any sleep as it sounded like cockroaches and/or moths were running around in the roof.  The TV did not work.  When we woke up in the morning the power did not work in the bathroom or the coffee maker.  We had to shower with our Iphone lights.  We called the front desk but no answer.  Also, one of the phones did not work.  There was no shampoo but two bottles of conditioner.  The drapes did not close all the way and let light in at 5am.  The walls were paper thin and we could here everyone elses conversation all morning.  The only reason I am giving this hotel two stars is because it has a clean room.  Also, I am a silver Hilton rewards member and did not receive any water....this is the dessert, I was thirty.  We couldn't wait to get out of this hotel.  Also, there was no valet, and no bellman to help us in.  We only saw one check-in agent when we arrived.  The room was a good size.  But I couldn't not fit into the bathroom with my wife.  It was the tiniest bathroom I have every seen at a hotel."}
{"text":"While it's a middle-aged hotel, the gracious staff more than compensate for the few wrinkles showing in its infrastructure.  Nearly every person we encountered was friendly and welcoming.  One of the valets opened the door for us and humorously commented on the Arizona heat. The front desk staff quickly processed our online check-in. Ivan from maintenance came to our room to fix the running toilet. He identified the trouble immediately and fixed it within three minutes. Even a landscaper from an outside contracted company saw us walking toward the elevator, so he pressed the down button immediately, and the elevator doors opened just as we approached. He made me feel like a Jedi Knight.  There were two staff members who made our stay particularly memorable. James, the Lobby Ambassador, and Marianne, a server in the breakfast buffet.   Every time I ventured into the lobby, James greeted me and asked if there was anything I needed. I certainly hope he gets paid well for his talent at reading people.   For breakfast, I asked to be seated at the comfy chair/coffee table/sofa area of the dining room just so I could read chapter one of Go Set a Watchmen quietly. (Thank you Hilton for providing complimentary copies of The Wall Street Journal to your guests.) The chilly hostess seemed put-off that I didn't want to sit at a table in the dining area. I'm not sure how my request throws off her system, but I decided to ignore this one person who seemed befuddled and just grab some breakfast and coffee.  And that's when James appeared again. He's a hospitality ninja! He checked in on me as I was eating and reading. What a beautiful person. He saw that I was reading, so he kept his interaction short, but I think I could chat with him all day. He must have fascinating stories about the variety of people he speaks to every day. Where they come from. Why they're traveling. His stories would make a fantastic blog!  Now Marianne. Another fabulous human being! She heard me say that I preferred to sit somewhere quiet so she moved a place setting over to the coffee table. She checked in on me without being intrusive. And when she saw me grabbing a coffee to go, she offered to get it for me. We had a short, but genuine conversation. Marianne understands the true nature of hospitality. Our conversation was abbreviated by the hostess giving Marianne the stink eye, so apparently she needed to get back to the kitchen. While the young hostess looks attractive, Marianne is the beautiful soul in the breakfast buffet.  The bed was quite comfy. We had a room facing the inner courtyard and pool area. While we could hear some music from the people using the pool, it was quite subdued. Background white noise. We spent one night here and woke pleasantly rested. We would stay here again."}
{"text":"Hilton, come on, you can do better.  I arrive around 11pm.  No one in the lobby.  No one at the desk.  No bell/buzzer to ring.  After a few minutes.  The phone rings at the check-in desk.  Someone appears from a closed door to answer the phone.  While I continue to wait.  Hilton, are you so damn cheap that you can't post a person to stay at the desk?  This doesn't happen anywhere else in the world.    Reducing rating - level of service not deserving of Scottsdale standards."}
{"text":"A little dated and definitely overpriced for what the property is. I was there on business and it's good the company was paying or I'd have been a little more upset. With the quality of the Hilton brand, especially the resorts, I suppose I just expected a little more. The restaurant was lackluster. Fleming's was good. I will say they were very accommodating by having a pack and play in my room as my infant was traveling with me on the weekend of the stay. The front desk staff were great! That's the saving grace of this property."}
{"text":"I expected a nice place considering the AAA 4 star rating but not close .  The place is old and smelly and the pool bar not appetizing!  The rooms are large but nothing special. The bathrooms are so small you can't walk in and turn around without closing the door first .  I would not stay here again.  The check in process was very nice everyone was very helpful. I bet Flemings wishes they were in a different spot!  Oh and those creaking ceilings!  It's bad! The first few times you hear it you don't know what is happening.  And it goes on all night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked in for a 25th anniversary staycation. The hotel is older but still nicely maintained. The room was comfortable and clean.  We were in the 2nd floor and it was amazingly quiet through the night.  My husband had the breakfast buffet and said it was the best he'd ever had.  The best part about the weekend was the incredibly thoughtful details by the staff. My husband mentioned our anniversary at check in. Around 6:30, we received a knock at our door and a staff member presented us with a basket of snacks and a happy anniversary card. Then, around 7:30, another knock came and we were given a bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.   Those small touches really showed that the staff pay attention to their guests. Thanks for a nice stay and a great anniversary."}
{"text":"Here for a two day training seminar.  Rooms are great. Beds firm and comfy.  Our food for the two days was delicious.   Beautiful resort.  Service attentive and customer focused.  Loved this resort."}
{"text":"As a person that loves hotels and stayed at 1000s of hotels in my life I can tell you this about the Hilton at Scottsdale.  Besides of the nice and big rooms,  Besides of the welcoming lobby area,  Besides of the car service the hotel provides,  What really makes this place successful is the people that work there!   The staff in this hotel really go above and beyond for the guests, And this is what makes this place so special.  I would absolutely recommend everyone to stay at this place!   Thank you Hilton for an amazing experience at your lovely hotel!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Scottsdale, I only go for business (about 1 time a year), I usually stay at this hotel.  It is very reasonably priced.  I will do work at the pool (wish they had outlets, so I do not have to rely on battery power only).  I like the pool side service.  Food and drinks are good.  Food at restaurant (breakfast/lunch is ok).  Room is acceptable."}
{"text":"Decent place for a group meeting although the wifi was limited in our room. Spotty and very slow. Friendly and helpful staff. Mike the limo driver was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice location, close to all the good spots. They made the villas seem like a secluded island but the pool was so small. I was told it was only for adults but there was a bunch of kids playing in it and they were loud we could hear them from our villa. Our outdoor view was that of a broken down mobile home on wheel that they were fixing when we arrived. It was not a good experience and I would not recommend this for anyone in the future. Overpriced and not a good experience. Better luck next time Hilton. My honors membership isn't that impressive so I'll be switching to Marriott soon."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!  I only stayed one night and when I woke up the next morning I had bed bug bites all over both my legs!!!   Also there's no refrigerators in the rooms. There's what they call a \"cold storage box\" in the room and thinking it was broken because it wasn't cold we called and the staff told us we had to order a refrigerator and it would be $10/night. Absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"5 stars for quality of service and professionalism, but 3 stars for the villa room. I would have given the villa 5 stars but man when the heat or AC is turned on or off, it is so loud I literally jump or my heart skips a beat. Is there anything that can be fixed?  The service experienced at breakfast, the bar, and front desk was exceptional. Everyone was very nice and professional.   The breakfast buffet was your standard buffet (see Bluefire Grill review), with one rotating dish every day (one day was biscuits with sausage gravy; another day was some tamale type dish). The dining area is quite small though, so there may be a wait.  On Sundays, they offer an omelette bar too!  The bar is rather large and stays open till midnight, as opposed to their other restaurant, Flemings Steakhouse, which closes at 10PM.   The villas are a long walk from the main hotel, so we drove. The villas has a nice pool and hot tub, whereas the main hotel pool is quite larger with kiddie pool, and hot tub.  Both pools were heated (but still a wee bit cold) and have towels to lay down.   The villas are so large and renovated.  I just loved it!  The only negative were the following: the beds were a little squeaky and the hvac unit when turned on is so loud, i almost woke up every time, even in deep sleep when it was turned on and off.  Anyways, It has a full kitchen and washer/dryer in the unit.  It has a private courtyard too. Awesome surround bar for the main living room tv (has tv in each bedrooms with limited tv stations though) with loud pumping sound for movies and sports. Please print out a list of the tv stations somewhere!  No resort fee (saves quite a bit $) or pay to park at this hotel (a big plus) with complimentary WiFi for HHonors (make sure to sign up).  Fantastic location, close to the 101, Old Town, Fashion Square Mall!"}
{"text":"Stayed here a couple weeks ago when I was in town for spring training and I overall thought the hotel was okay. The room was pretty standard but clean. Pool as nice and having a pool bar was a bonus. This is definitely an ideal location if you're looking to avoid the loud \"party\" crowd that flocks to most of the hotels during spring training. It was a lot quieter than most and older. Despite a few gems, we had some pretty horrible customer service incidents while staying here. Every pool bartender we encountered in the afternoon and evening walked around like they hate life... they could not have been more unfriendly. We had an awful experience at the restaurant too - I would definitely not eat there again...food took for-ev-er. The shuttle guys were very hit or miss too - some were very nice and friendly and others had major attitude... one even told us he doesn't like \"dealing with people\"... umm, then why are you in the service industry?? Definitely not my first choice for hotel in the area but it was okay."}
{"text":"Decent hotel for the money.   Rooms were clean (besides the massive bee hive outside of our first room's window - the hotel took care of spraying this area right away, but we still requested a new room). King room is a good size, but the bathroom was very small.  Good location - about 10 minutes driving distance to Old Town.  Nice to have Fleming's in the hotel for that 10pm small plate craving.   I would try another hotel next time."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about our experience here. We asked to switch to a king bed upon check in and the super friendly girl at the front desk gave us a 1st floor king, with our doors opening up the the bar/pool area. We LOVED our room. Awesome location and super spacious. They had a shuttle which we used a few times that would take you within a 3 mile radius- super convenient. Sunday night we rented a car online , and the next morning they called to tell us they didn't have any available. We went to the front desk and little did we know- they had a hertz there at the hotel and we were able to rent a car and get on the road within 10 minutes -thanks to Martha! She was super helpful and gave us tips on places to go on our little road trip to Sedona. We truly loved our experience here and will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"The property is extensive and the grounds and pool areas are nicely maintained. The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired as does the bar. I had fajitas one night and there was no seasoning. Menu is limited and on stained paper. Real problem is service- the only bartender is also the only server in the restaurant. They are polite and do their best but management has set them up to fail. Rooms were clean and standard. Better deal is the Embassy up the street."}
{"text":"I attended a charity event here last weekend and I enjoyed it very much. I have not stayed in the hotel yet (as I live down the street), but I will say Flemmings steakhouse and their event facilities are top notch. The location is great too with several dining and shopping options across the street and Old Town Scottsdale a mere $7 cab ride away."}
{"text":"Very nice location with excellent service. Pros: Customer service, beautiful interior and exterior, comfortable and well designed rooms, excellent food, good prices and awesome valet.  Cons: If you're a light sleeper like I am, you'll wake up a lot.  Ceiling creeks at night, guests can be heard through the walls and people start getting up at 5:30 am. We stayed on the second floor, so maybe that's isolated for the creaking ceiling.  I'd stay here again because of the service."}
{"text":"f I could give zero stars I would. We decided to have a staycation across town to celebrate the labor day weekend and my wife's birthday.  When I checked in i was told I was upgraded to a better room because of my status with Hilton Honor so they gave me a room on the first floor instead of the one on the third floor that I chose with the app. No big deal, I stay at Hilton's all the time but just thought it was odd to be months first floor. Anyways, we got to our room and noticed it was in desperate need of renovation. We also noticed roaches roaming free. I went to the front desk and told the receptionist and her response was, \"Well it's hot outside and that's expected in Arizona\". I said that's BS because I live down the road and have no signs of roaches in my house. She said she would send engineering. Engineering confirmed my complaint and said they would contact the manager. The manager called and said they could spray the room or move us to a new room tomorrow. She said they were sold out and couldn't move us. So we just left. Worst experience ever at a Hilton property."}
{"text":"Not without its inconsistencies, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort is an elegant and beautifully appointed hotel in a location convenient to both Old Town and the local highways.    The front desk and concierge service are absolutely top-notch, customer-centric and on their game.  The little details are tended to; good coffee and flavored waters in the main lobby, outstanding poolside bar service, thick cotton towels and robes and clean public areas among them.  In fact, so much attention is given to hosing-down the outdoor concrete that you would never suspect that the area has a water shortage.  Rooms were right-sized, neither spacious, nor cramped, and attractively furnished.  Water pressure was good on the first floor, but temperatures were extremely inconsistent and variable.  Beds appeared to be a bit old and not as comfortable as in most Hilton properties.  The available television stations were at least a decade behind current tastes, but high-end LG flat screens were appreciated.  WiFi bandwidth was outstanding, and didn't require constantly repeating a log-in process.  The Scottsdale Hilton Resort has two restaurants, an independent Fleming's (a top-tier chain steakhouse) and their own Blue Fire.  While I found the food at the Blue Fire to be adequate, I believe that the other members of my family will disagree.  Service is amateurish and slow, while prices are high.  No worries, however, as there are dozens of places to eat within an easy walking radius.  We checked-in as a family of four, yet received only three sets of towels.  The front desk was apologetic, and promised that additional towels would be delivered shortly.  Three hours later we called again and the extra towels arrived within five minutes.  Yet for each of the two remaining days of our stay housekeeping brought only three sets.  It is an attention to details like this which separate \"very good\" from \"great\" motels.  There is plenty of free parking, but the campus is very large and long walks may be necessary if you don't park near the closest entry point to your room.  Our room had a locked refrigerator, which I'll assume to be a cash bar feature, yet we were never offered the opportunity to obtain a key.  We enjoyed our stay at Scottsdale Hilton Resort, and at $119/night found an incredible irony in the fact that the least expensive of the three motels on our cross-Arizona vacation was clearly the best."}
{"text":"I went here for work. They place simply put, amazing. It is like a little oasis in the middle of nowhere. The major road out front, can't hear it. They have a lot of seating areas and the way it is decorated makes you feel relaxed. They people that I ran into that works they were absolutely friendly. Didn't get to see the rooms as we were there for a conference. I think I would like to take my wife there for a little relaxing."}
{"text":"I have this 2 stars because the staff is very pleasant and helpful.  Also, the location is fantastic, close to malls & within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Walgreens, & great restaurants. On the negative side, our room was in desperate need of a renovation.  It smelled old and musty.  The hallway smelled as well.  It was cleaned but didn't feel clean.  The vents were dirty & the carpet turned your feet black it you walk around barefoot.  Our tv brightness was turned way down.  The beds are not very comfortable.  The walls are so thin that we could not only hear our neighbors full phone conversation, we could hear his phone ring. If you don't mind a mediocre room this is the place for you.  Otherwise, chose from one of he many other beautiful resorts in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I must say that the Hilton Resort off of Scottsdale road in Arizona is amazing!   My first time in Arizona ( great state) and my first time staying at a Hilton Hotel. I had a wonderful time and was greeted, smiled at and constantly ask is there anything I needed. What a great Staff and Customer Service. The hotel was clean, food was great and the drinks was what the doctor ordered!   What can I say?!  I will be staying their again and again. I never got the impression of not being important from any staff member there. I especially want to give another 5 star to Tyler who works the front desk. Tyler was amazing from A to Z. Tyler is the MAN!!!  He went beyond a 110% into helping me and my family. Thank you again Tyler , you were a great part within our Arizona and Hilton experience. Always had a smile on his face as the others. Thank you for the friendship, customer service and the great smiles you guys!!!! The Hilton off of Scottsdale road is in a great location. Don't have to worry about the obvious while staying there. You will be completely safe and with no worries. It's surroundings include all the lunch, dinner and dinner spots. Also, shopping places are there too. All in walking distance. You WIL NOT be disappointed when you stay here.   Respectfully,  Tim Jenkins ( Southern California)"}
{"text":"I stayed here for a group business trip.  Hotel was prepaid thru my employer. Here were some issues.  1)Service desk attendant wasn't aware of dry cleaner procedures and when the items are due back. Wasn't very helpful in trying to find out when my time was to be back.  I had to ask for manager on duty and tell him to call the cleaner. It was only the manager that was aware of time of day when they arrive.  2) service in restaurant/bar extremely slow and not attentive. Even in middle of day when there was no rush hour for lunch. Waited over 25 min for a lunch salad to go.  Was told it was going to be ready in few minutes and I went to my room ( on other side of hotel) and came back and it was still not ready. No one was at bar to ask.   3) got a nice massage at the spa here.  Not a typical spa, with area for relaxation. Pretty simple décor, and just 2 massage rooms.  Its connected to the fitness area.  there is a steam room/sauna, but I didn't get to try it.  My therapist was waiting for me at the door when I got done, so I felt a bit rushed to leave."}
{"text":"The Hilton is in a great location less than a 10 minute drive to Old Town Scottsdale and less than five minutes to Camelback hiking. The hotel provides free transportation (usually with a 10-15 minute wait) via SUV to both of those locations which comes in very handy and economical. The hotel is also across the street from a shopping mall which includes CVS and a Trader Joes which is convenient. The employees at the hotel were all incredibly friendly and accommodating, but very slow so get ready to wait around.  My friends and I stayed in a regular double room for one night and then a two bedroom villa for two nights. The double room was average- standard for a Hilton. The villas were pretty much an apartment. Spacious fully kitchen stocked with water bottles and dishware, washer and dryer, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a pullout couch, a full patio, and a dining area. The furniture is outdated and I wouldn't necessarily call the interior decoration nice, but it does the job. I would highly recommend for a large group or family- the extra space compared to a hotel room made our stay much more comfortable. A big con about the villas is that they are in a separate area detached from the main hotel. You will need to be driven by the hotel from the main lobby to the villa which gets quite annoying especially if the driver is out transporting other patrons to Old Town.  The only meal we ate in-house during our stay here was the breakfast buffet. It isn't highly extensive but has the staples- eggs, waffles, bacon, bagels, omelet station, fruit, and cereal. The food is pretty good making it worth $20 per person especially if you have the time to spend there.  If you are looking for a luxury high-end hotel, then this isn't your spot (even with upgrading to the villa room). However, if you are looking for something practical, friendly, and in centrally located within Scottsdale, this is an ideal choice."}
{"text":"No bell boy to help me while I waa struggling with a bunch of things. No one offered help. No front desk service for 5 mins when I arrived. Hall ways smell like public toilets. Shitty. Def not a 4 star hotel."}
{"text":"For about $350 dollars a night you would expect a quiet and well prepared room. Unfortunately we received neither. Sent to room 166, prior to going to bed , we noticed terrible loud electrical humming noise coming through the wall. A quick investigation let me to the adjacent storage room where the circuit breaker box was emitting the noise.  Could get a quieter room at a Hotel 6 I thought  and called the front desk. Had to move the entire family late in the evening for us ( 1130 equivalent our time) and although I asked to speak to the manager that fell on deaf ears and now the ears of YELP. Had someone from management made the effort to call would not have listed this.   Second room had no sheets for the sofa bed. A call downstairs resulted in the sheets--  we got three and were lucky since two were wet.   The staff are quite nice and helpful, they did the best they could,. They were very accommodating. The car service is excellent and efficient. The breakfast was quite good . The problem here is senior management should fix that noise.   You're on vacation. You don't deserve this.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I stayed here for 6 nights and was ready to leave by the end of my stay. The hotel is in dire need of a renovation. The toilet in the room was not normal-sized. It reminded me of the toilets that we would use in kindergarten through 3rd grade. The beds were extremely noisy if you toss and turn at night. I could also hear my neighbor when he would move around in his bed. The shower head had lime build-up. My tv was broken on the 3rd day and had to be replaced which was an hour long process of me staying in the room while he troubleshooted and eventually just gave me a new tv. The only thing good about this place was the daily water bottle service."}
{"text":"This is an older property, and it shows.   My cousin rented a villa, and it needed some pretty extensive work. Paint being number one!  The staff could easily make up for this by being super nice and helpful, but I was a bit shocked by the cold and unhelpful attitude we received from most of the staff. On the whole, there are a TON of resorts in the area, and they're nearly all better than this. Spend the extra if needed, and go elsewhere unless you really need the size of their villas"}
{"text":"2 stars only because of the good poolside service and food. For someone that has traveled the world staying at Hilton properties this hotel by far was the second worst property I have stayed at. For a hotel located in a desert you would think their air conditioning would be great...wrong! Our AC would randomly go out. We complained daily with never a confirmation that anyone came to fix it and the issue continued for the remainder of the stay. Which sucked since it was a very warm week. I attempted to work in my room but every 10 minutes there were loud cracks and noises as though something was going to fall through the wooden ceiling!! I have never been on the top floor and felt as though I was on the first. Not to mention those noises occurring throughout the night. There was an awful smell of shampooed carpets throughout the hallways that made me nauseous. Basically any chance I got to escape my room was great. I loved the city but will NEVER return to this property."}
{"text":"I stayed here a couple weeks ago for business and although the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and all I wasn't impressed with the hotel. I assumed it would be a nice resort hotel since it was in Scottsdale, AZ (resort capital right??) but it was not. It's pretty outdated. My bed was comfy but the hotel itself needs an overhaul. The walls are VERY thin. I heard the neighbors coming home, talking, breathing, etc. The TV was an old tube style TV! Come on even Holiday Inns now have LCD's lol. Sorry I judge hotels by TVs :)  I ate at the hotel restaurants and was not pleased. The food is lackluster at best without much variety nor flavor. And that's including the breakfast buffet! I live for my breakfasts when I travel so not meeting my standards in servicing such a simple but best meal of the day is disappointing. I know hotel food is never the greatest but I've had delicious meals at many hotels.   The highlight was definitely eating at Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, which is connected to the hotel. Absolutely the best salmon!! I loved it so much that it deserved to have its very own review written lol."}
{"text":"This review is based on a 3 day stay at this hotel, \"Resort\" and doesn't reflect the \"Villa\" aspect of the stay. The meals are quite good at the Hotel's BlueFire Grille. The steaks and seafood were cooked to order and the presentation was lovely in the evening. The breakfast meals were acceptable, but the buffet was lacking a little bit. I personally loved the evening meals offered at the restaurants around the Hotel quite a bit. The swimming pool is advertised as heated, but I tend to doubt this, although a brisk swim after lounging in the hot tub was fun. Now the bad... The walls, doors, and vents in this building (originally built by Merve Griffin) are faulty. Faulty to the point that noise at any usual hotel or motel would mute it so it wouldn't disturb other guest's sleeping habits. When I was walking down the halls, I could hear people talking, snoring, and watching TV everywhere in the building. In my room I could hear the next door guests talking about their sports games or whatever, and I could hear the wake up alarms all go off in the morning across the halls while my room's door was closed. The building is also oddly designed to not allow guests to easily find ice machines, and good luck finding a vending machine, even for water. Finally on the last day, the weekend happened and the pool was too full of local people, who seem to view this hotel as a valid home vacation destination, and two different banquets that spilled out into the guest's areas... I liked the food, but it didn't seem like much of a vacation to me."}
{"text":"This place is bizarre. We ended up here booking last minute on Hotwire. We're not really picky as long as a place is nice and clean, but I'm not sure where a place that's selling rooms at $50 a night on Hotwire gets off trying to make you pay extra if you want a king bed instead of two doubles? It would have been fine if they were simply out of kings, but trying to make people pay for it is just silly. They actually are double beds, so we just slept in separate beds. Not a huge deal for us, but if you want romance, you'll pay for it.  It also was a million degrees in the room and the AC wouldn't really work. It was probably only in the 80s outside, so I'm not really sure why. The whole place has a weird horror movie feel to it, which seems very strange for a \"resort\" in Scottsdale.  Best of all, the building makes all kinds of terrifying settling/creaking sounds like it's about to fall down. My husband threw a pillow at the ceiling to be funny and it sounded like the roof was going to cave in."}
{"text":"Not 4 Diamond, AAA got it wrong. Go to the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa at Gainey Ranch, and compare.  To me, I was expecting a hotel equivalent to Hyatt, but instead got a Hilton Garden Inn like hotel, with no bottle water for HHonors Gold Guest and no morning paper waiting at door.     Even the Hampton Inn got it right.  As a frequent traveler, I don't expect much, but I do expect consistency, and the little things go a long way.  I guess by staying at Hilton's in London, New York, and San Francisco, I was expecting the same thing, including executive Lounge.  Not at this Hotel. Skip this Hotel and stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Scottsdale, not to far from here.      The cleaning folks here did a great job with my room, so room was clean."}
{"text":"I was here for a conference so sadly I didn't have a choice for another selection due to the expenses being paid for by my employer. Overall it seems as if this Hilton is struggling with a remodel (as of Feb 2016). It's as if they were limited in budget so there were some upgrades, like the wallpaper and possibly the headboards but not the desk or the dresser.   When I first arrived at my room and opened my door I was greeted to the thick smell of chlorine... and my room was located no where near the pool! Although they upgraded the TV the digital TV/cable system was something from the early 2000's. Most modern systems allow things like in-room checkout and services from the TV but although it was advertised while watching the programs whenever you clicked on the remote to view it it took you to a login prompt which was clearly reserved for the IT admins. ????  I opened the cabinet to where the fridge should be my reaction was much like the scene from Shawshank Redemption where the warden discovers an escape tunnel hidden by a poster in Tim Robbin's cell. Where was the fridge? When I called the front desk they mentioned how they were removing the mini-bars from the rooms. If I wanted a fridge it was an extra $75 but was soon waived within 2 min after calling me back.  The conference rooms were actually not bad. I only ate once at the restaurant on site which wasn't bad. There are several good food joints across the street or at the mall one parking lot just to the south. If you need cheap snacks the small strip mall across Scottsdale Ave has a Trader Joes tucked in back.  I definitely wouldn't ever pay money to stay at this \"resort\" and I'm glad I didn't have to especially after seeing all of the other choices (e.g. Doubletree, etc) nearby.  The one saving grace which kept it from being a single star is the service."}
{"text":"What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice!  Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice. The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service.."}
