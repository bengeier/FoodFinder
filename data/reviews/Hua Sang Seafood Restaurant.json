{"text":"Had to make an account just to review this restaurant.  First it's very nice inside. Now the food? Horrible. We ordered a fried rice -undercooked and felt like you were eating rocks. The noodle? Horrible. Insant noodle tastes better, it was again undercooked. The shrimp? All skin, you can't even taste the meat. But the spring roll was allright (to be fair after the noodle and rice, mcdonald would have been high class) The soup was fine. Now the lady taking our order for take out  was downright unprofessional, the way she was speaking and her attitude was unwelcoming. Ive been to hundreds of great restaurant around toronto and the world but my god this just was just ridiculously bad. Would never recommend to anyone at all , it was just too mediocre.  Clearly this was my personal experience but other reviews on the internet was not that great - should have listened to them.
 1.5/5"}
{"text":"My childhood hole in a wall comfort food. The best lobster in town, must orders are the lobster with ginger and garlic and the snails in black bean sauce - nowhere else in town cook these like Hua Sang does."}
{"text":"So... there are chinese restaurants and there are chinese restaurants. The former is for those late night munchies and you're too lazy to get your fat butt out the door for a decent meal and the guy with the bike with plastic bag on the seat delivers some MSG soaked meat that tastes vaguely of garlic and peppers. The latter is Hua Sang (and other chinese restaurants of this caliber). They've got some pretty good food for some alright prices.

Try their lobster. both types. I personally like the garlic and something 
one, as opposed to the black bean one... which also good.. they're both favorite, but the garlic one is a little bit more favorite. (thank's b. reagan). 

dont go to wah sing. its Hua Sang. 
btw - toronto's a pretty cool city. wish i had more time there..."}
{"text":"Lobster caked with fried ginger and green onion is the highlight of this hole-in-the wall Chinese seafood restaurant.  The ambience and service is stereotypical Chinese-in-North-America restaurant.  There is nothing distinctive about the place except for its excellent seafood dishes.  Ignore the surrounding and concentrate on the food."}
{"text":"Ask most who've heard about this place then they will tell you one thing, and one thing only --- Go for the lobster special!!

2 lobsters for $29.99

I've been eating on and off at Hua Sang for roughly 10 years. And its alway during summer for their lobster special.

This is a ol school Chinese Restaurant, you don't come here for decor or the service, you come for the lobster special.  The rest of the menu is pretty good, but regular fare -- though classics like seafood & veg in \"birds nest\" is pretty good.

A little background I'm Canadian Chinese, and although everything usually tastes great with black bean sauce --- lobster doesn't . So NEVER get the black bean lobster and ALWAYS get the Ginger & Green Onion lobster.

The taste is amazing I will just slightly chew the lobster shell cause the flavor is that good. Imagine sucking the bare bones of ribs cause it was that good - same here.

Also I don't think any other Chinese Restaurant has perfected the way Hua Sang does the Ginger & Green Onion Lobster. All other Chinese Restaurants seem to steam cook the lobster in a sauce and thats it.

And for those used to the Red Lobster crap or just the western way of giving you a thick piece of small lobster tail meat this is different.

Chinese style is chopping it up and cooking it in a wok. If you've ever seen anything done in a wok the proportions are usually small so everything cooks well. 

So be prepared to eat this like you're eating crab legs, but they cut it so professionally that if you eat here a while you know exactly how to tackle each piece."}
{"text":"Lobster was so good I felt like eating the shell too! I love these kinda places, just great food."}
{"text":"The best when it comes to a big meal on a tight budget. You can share the dishes and leave with full takeout containers. The lobster with friend ginger and green onion is definitely a favourite for my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster with the ginger and green onions.  I'm a fan of seafood and definitely had never had lobster prepared in this way.  It was a very tasty dish.
Although all of my clothes now smell of fried spring rolls, I was the only patron in the place, so I chatted with the family owners.  The conversation was pretty simple considering I don't speak chinese, and he didn't speak much english.  I felt like I was in the movie lost in translation, we were both trying really hard to move the conversation around, but just filled the confusion by laughing at each other.  His young daughter chimed in as she chatted on her cell phone, she was my sniper translator.    
I am very impressed with Toronto's wide variety of great restaurants to choose from.  If I chose to ever live here I may have to quickly apply to be on NBC's 'the biggest loser' show.  Torontonians, you are lucky."}

I would not recommend going here."}

Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I almost puked. 

This was my second time visiting them since i heard their previous chef has changed. 

This time was no joke.... We ordered 3 dishes - fried lobster with black bean sauce, fried lobster with ginger and onions, and shrimp chow mein. 

How bad can you go with the shrimp chow mein dish.. I've never seen any restaurant go wrong with it but this restaurant CAN. Stale noodles. I could not bite/chew/swallow noodles at all.......... Shrimps were jokes... tiny little 4 or 5 of them..... Bok choy was....I...i had to spitted it out =_= NOT FRESH-you can totally tell!! So disgusting! 
And it's almost $20. =_=.........The most disgusting shrimp chow mein i had in my life. I had to threw away the whole dish. wasted my money. 

Two lobster dish was not satisfying either. The lobsters weren't fresh that the meat weren't going to come out of their shells...... They were all sticking in the shell. This happens when the lobsters aren't fresh. 

Things really changed since the old chef left the restaurant. Is the owner changed? Is that why? Any how... I'm not retuning to this place ever again. And I want to tell anyone who is planning to visit here to NOT GO. Not worth spending your money.

I want my $89.25 BACK!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from the menu this lousy restaurant provided on their website. Once I got there to pick up, my total amount for the food that I ordered was significantly higher than the prices stated in the online menu. The male worker there with the red highlight in his hair, I believe he was the owner, took out the restaurant paper menu and rudely pointed out to me that the price was correct and showed me the statement in their menu that said \"prices are subject to increase without any notice.\" 

NOW, If this would have been stated in the online menu, I wouldn't have ordered from this restaurant. 

If something on the online menu states that a dish is $11, why would i have to pay $19 total when I go and pick it up. Thats a fucking $8 difference for one lousy dish. 

Update your fucking website. You should also rethink your decision of being the owner of an \"established Chinese restaurant.\" You are a disgrace to the Asian community ripping people off especially in an area where the community is predominantly made up of students. 

Never coming here again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant has always been our family go to place in downtown Toronto whenever we felt like eating lobster. The owner and his two sons run the business and are the restaurant waiters. Unfortunately we will never come back here ever again. Here is why: We called and made reservations for Mother's Day the day before for 8 people and they wrote my number and name so this was not a problem as they seemed to accept reservations. Arrived right at 6:30pm the next evening on Mother's Day and noticed a fair number of people waiting, but nothing that should have led to the way the owner treated us. I confirmed our arrival with the owner and he gave me the most rude response as if we were not welcomed and said he will check my name and number. Waited 10minutes and not a single word was said to me that confirmed my reservation. This was very upsetting and I understand it's the most busiest day of the year. Asked the son in the front and he said he's going to check. At this point it was obvious they were taking people on a first come first serve basis. Waited a few more minutes and still no word from owner and son regarding availability. We then decided to leave. 

We wasted nearly 30 minutes with no word of how long the wait will be. If you will not be honouring a reservation let your customers know on the phone that it will be a first come first serve basis so customers can go else where. Very disappointed and will not be returning customer."}
{"text":"Back again one rainy night in July, I think it was the only rainy night thus far in the summer.  Unfortunately it was late near closing time around 10ish and the Lobster wasn't as good as the first time.

It may have been steamed earlier then wok fried for us because although the garlicky flavour was there it was a bit dry and not as good as we remembered.  

Went for the noodle dish this time as I said previous review it seemed like a winner when looking at other tables.  It wasn't, noodles where overcooked and the pork/shrimp/vegg where done like yesterday.

I'm going to give the place a break and try again,  our timing may have been the reason and I did love that lobster.  

Our waiter looked overworked and was not that nice to us at the beginnning but when we mentioned he looked tired he kinda threw up his arms and relaxed a bit.  We may have been that last table he didn't want.  He calmed his nerves and became actually a nice guy.  Please don't overwork your waitstaff it shows in their performance.  We felt sorry for him and gave a generours tip.  Will be back again but at a reasonable hour.

However the food disappointed us - they were flavourful, but we didn't get enough for three people.

{"text":"1 star for the service

4 star for the food

2 star for the location/ place

OMG. The service is abysmal. The waiter that waited our table looked so arrogant. I felt that he's asking me to throw my sandals to him. GAH. He was very impatient asking our order. The service is honestly a debacle. I felt that I was rushed. The place has this ambiance of \" I have a goddamn good food, so I don;t need to be nice to you\", so it is more of a Take It Or Leave It vibe.. 

The food is pretty decent, surprisingly. The lobster that we got was exquisitely seasoned. The \"Indian style\" chicken was soooo amazing. You should try this. The soft shell crab wasn't that good. Some of the part was burnt. 

Overall, I will come back when I'm in the mood for some non-existent, rude, and arrogant waiter that will wait my table. The chance of that is pretty slim. Maybe I will come back with the craving from the Indian Style Chicken. 

Maybe.. Maybe Not.."}
{"text":"I really don't care to work for my food so I rarely order lobster or crab, but I came here on a Sunday evening at the recommendation of the reviews.  Hua Sang was within walking distance of the Sheraton Centre and was a nice stroll particularly after over-eating at dinner.

I'm glad that I wrote down both the address and the name of the restaurant as there were quite a few Chinese restaurants when I turned onto Baldwin from McCaul.  The service isn't bad here - it's typical of Chinese restaurants where you often have to repeat yourself to get someone's attention.  

From what I could tell, one big difference between the lobster with garlic and ginger and the lobster with black bean sauce is the former is fried and dry while the latter is - duh - in a sauce.  The nice lady who took my order looked at me funny when I ordered an entire lobster for myself.  What the heck was I supposed to do seeing that I was in Toronto on my own for work.  I ordered the lobster with garlic and enjoyed it, though I definitely started to slow down about 2/3 of the way.

MasterCard and Visa, no AmEx.  My server laughed at the picture on my Visa as it was, shall we say, a photo from when I had bleached hair.  Ha ha - WTF?  They served a nice little dessert after dinner - a bowl of beans in a sweet brown sauce."}

{"text":"This place has restaurant prices and less than Food court quality meals...
Its very difficult to talk as its extremly packed and incredibly loud. The food takes a long time to be ready and isnt worth the wait or the bill. The food court around the corner has better chinese food."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday lunch and there was barely anyone maybe because it was a long weekend. 

We ordered lobster for two, fried with ginger and green  onions. We loved the dish and thought it was a good deal for only $36! We also had Crispy Beef with orange peel, also very good with the perfect amount of sauce. Their yang chow fried rice was yummy. We got half of their house special fried chicken and I found it very tasty as well. 

All in all, it was a great meal and i like that it was very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Ordered single lobster lunch, and deep fried oysters, food was great! Everything tastes wonderful and lobster meat is still bouncy so i can tell it's fresh.  
The only unpleasant thing is the traffic outside, Disera is a very tight road so be cautious when you drive in from centre road."}
{"text":"2 for 1 lobsters are pretty much the only things worth ordering. It's not amazing, but it's pretty delish and reasonably priced. We had the ginger & green onion ones and they were quite tasty. The ambience though...yikes. we walked in and the place smelt like unappetizing bleach. and the service...i'm chinese and used to curt service, but the guy was odd and his jokes to another table fell flat and sounded like he was insulting them. awkward"}
{"text":"An old family favorite for over 10 years now. A lot of memories were made here, and I can't say much other than that it brings a smile to my face just passing by. Hidden and probably the worst place for cell phone reception, but its all worth it I must say. They are known for their seafood, so please don't leave without trying atleast one..Lobster, crab, oysters, mussels, fish, you name it they've got it."}
{"text":"My parents and I had takeout from here recently. My parents have eaten here before and had takeout, but it was my first time having food from here.

We ordered the Double Lobster special ($38.99). You get 2 lobsters which are probably a pound each by my estimation. You get to choose the flavour, black bean, ginger onion or dry garlic. We got ginger onion.

The lobsters were delicious. They are chopped up with the shells on, lightly battered and fried with ginger, green onions and garlic. The style is dry, it's not saucy, which is what I like. The lobsters were fresh and the meat easily came off the shell. I really enjoyed it.

My parents said that once they ordered the exact same dish but it came covered in sauce instead of dry. They did not enjoy the sauced version. I can't explain the inconsistency, but if you want it dry, make sure you specify so you don't get your lobsters covered in sauce. 

The restaurant is on Baldwin Street which has a lot of character. It has an eclectic mix of restaurants and has a boehemian feel to it. Hua Sang though feels like a typical Chinese restaurant like the ones you'd find on Spadina or Dundas in Chinatown.

I would definitely get the lobster here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here as opposed to our other comparable Chinese restaurants and opted for our usual entree options.  Fried lobster with ginger and onion is a tad different spin on this classic fav of our's - still tasty but not as 'sauce-liberal.'  Cantonese chow mein and sweet 'n sour pork were devoured with no complaints.  Only hilarious moment was when they aggressively self-tipped themselves, casually bidding me farewell instead of offering my $8 change.  Only after I stood for a couple extra awkward seconds did he realize, \"oh, I better turn the register key and give back the change due.\"  Never heard of tipping for no service given.  And this was on top of the taxes total being almost $10 pricier than their online menu prices.  Interesting mark-up on all fronts!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I started coming here back about 15 yrs ago, which is when I fell in love with the ginger and black bean lobster dishes. 
However, my last experience tainted their reputation for me. A few weeks ago I showed up on a Saturday night for a take out order - a simple one too (1 ginger lobster, 1 beef with snow peas and 1 steamed rice).  I felt pretty confident that I was going to get what I ordered, as the hostess confirmed my order with me.  However, when I eventually opened all of the containers, I realized that I was given three containers of dried out ginger lobster. I couldn't make it back to the restaurant to complain, nor did I feel there would be any value in calling them. Although I would like to think that it was an honest mistake, the double whammy of poor quality food and bad service is enough to turn me off of coming back."}
{"text":"4.75++ OMFG!! Spicy shrimp, chicken fried rice, hot & sour soup, Beef & Cabbage & Broccoli, Fried chicken, Kung Pao Chicken & Mmm lots of hot tea. We met great new friends at Schmooze and they took us out for after club dinner at this restaurant. Nice staff, friendly service, great prices and great food. Don't miss out and come here to eat when you hit Toronto."}
{"text":"The food wasn't fresh at all, it felt like they just microwaved frozen or old leftovers. Then when we went to pay in cash, they didn't give us our change of $16 and they disappeared into the back never coming back."}
{"text":"The place is kinda dirty, the service isn't the best, but you're not here for that, you're here for the SEAFOOD.

The fried lobster with ginger and green onion was excellent - I believe the price now is 2 for 32.95.

My family and I really also enjoyed the mixed seafood bird's nest (one of my fave dishes in general), and the clams in black bean sauce.

The crab meat and fish maw soup was so-so.

The BEST part was, the free tofu fa dessert.  It's my fave, unfortunately I abhor red bean desserts (I'm an Asian oddity).

My family has been to this place for years, and it's changed owners... but my parents still approve.

I will be back, I'm salivating just thinking of it!

p.s. the place is super busy, be prepared to wait and protect yourself... other Asians will try to usurp your place in line (lol)."}
{"text":"Was it a piece of bad duck ?
 or spoiled fish sauce on rice ?
Hua Sang made me sick.
 IT WON\"T HAPPEN TWICE !"}
{"text":"Many of the positive reviews I see here are from 2014. 
I went for dinner on saturday night (March 2016) and was disappointed.  Having been a returning customer since 1998, the quality of the dishes has declined,  especially the lobster. I ordered ginger lobster, fried rice a tofu, and a vegetable dish (enough variety of dishes to submit a review). The lobster was dry and the other dishes were abnormally salty. There were 4 other tables who ordered lobster and one sent it back due to the lobster being cold and another table commented on how they were displeased with the taste and portion size.

The service was poor and when we provided feedback regarding the taste and quality of the dishes, we were told that it's not possible that the food tastes different than before as the chef has not changed. 

I do not recommend this restaurant for seafood (or even fried rice). It would be better value to spend a bit more and go to others in Scarborough where it is guaranteed to be a better experience."}
{"text":"Whenever I go downtown for food, I feel like passing up an opportunity to go to Hua Sang is a crime. I mainly go for their Cantonese chow mein, black bean flat rice noodles and hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup is made unlike any other place I've been to. If you like a flavourful hot and sour with a little kick to it, this is the right place. It's not too tart or vinegar-y. You'll find that Way-Sang (the restaurant upstairs) makes their hot and sour a bit more red. I love both but they each have their own unique flavour. 

I feel like the service has improved over the years. There's an older waitress who is kind of funny and will interact with you. I always enjoy eating here"}
{"text":"We went during the Christmas holidays but it was not that busy. Street parking was not that bad either. Walking down the steps with snow covered shoes however was a bit of a pain. But once you're in it doesn't really feel like a basement as it's a nice wide space with about 20-30 large tables.
Hua Sang (and the restaurant right above, I forget the name) is one of the few places (probably) that you can get live lobster this time of year. You could taste the freshness and it was also easy to remove the flesh from the lobster. 
We had the fried lobster with ginger and green onion, yang chao fried rice, rice noodle with soy sauce, some beef stir fry dish and one more that I can't remember right now. Usually Chinese food is salty and overloaded with MSG but this day was different and flavorful but not overly salty. We were able to keep it to one pitcher of water and two pots of tea between the whole table, highly unusual. 
It is more expensive than your neighborhood Chinese restaurant, but the quality is well worth it. And it is mostly seafood. 
Their bathroom was satisfactory. The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with friends and family but on a recent visit I found that they had raised their price to $50 for two lobsters and then denied that there was a price change. The food is still good and the service is quick but there's no longer a great deal that made it a clear choice to come here for seafood- now we'll be considering other options unless we really want Chinese style lobster."}
{"text":"ORDER LOBSTER!

That's all you need to know about Hua Sang. When I visit my family in Toronto, we get trays and trays of the lobster dishes from Hua Sang. I don't usually eat lobster (not because I'm cheap, it's because I like crab more) but the ways they prepare it are so good. It's lightly battered and you can get it with ginger and green onions and I think they have it with a black bean sauce too? (I forget exactly-it's been a year since I went) It's all very delicious and they offer all your basic Chinese food too, but don't waste your time. Stick with lobster."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and had the double lobster Hong Kong style, shrimp stuffed fried tofu, seafood chow mein, beef rice noodle, sweat and sour pork spare ribs and garlic water cress vegetable. Some good some bad. 
The good to start - the service was amazingly quick and efficient. The servers were friendly and attentive. The food came quick and hot. The seafood chow mein is what seafood chow mein (crunchy noodles with tasty sauce and fresh seafood) should be and the stuffed fried tofu was exquisite, delicate and delicious. We got complimentary desert of sweet tofu which really was the highlight of the meal for me. It was so tasty, velvety melt in your mouth smooth. You really do not get this in Chinese restaurants for desert anymore. Kudos to Hua Sang for this.
Now for the bad. The water cress and beef rice noodles were tasteless. There were no bold flavours at all to the sweat and sour pork which you would expect. When you call yourself a Chinese seafood restaurant, you had better have really good seafood. This was not the case here. The lobsters did not taste fresh, had very little meat and it was just not pleasing to eat. It did not even seem like we got two lobsters. The taste was \"rough\", not finely made and not \"succulent\" as lobster should be. 
Our final bill was on the high side for what we got so I will not be returning and my wife concurs. I also noticed the manager or owner sitting in the eating area on his phone most of the time which was a turn off for me.
If they did not call it a seafood restaurant then I would have rated it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Zero stars.. AND I MEAN IT ZEROOOOOOOO
This place is nasty, disgusting, dirty all the above. You get my point! Service is horrendous!!! We spoke Chinese to the waiter and he said I don't  understand. He turns around and starts speaking with the owner in Chinese!
Owner has a nasty attitude also.. it's well worth it to travel to markham or Richmond hill for Asian food. Toronto chinatown is a disgrace for the Asian community. This place is sooooo disgusting that in the men's washroom they put table ice in the urinal and ask you to piss on it and put a sign there DO NOT FLUSH TOLIET IT'S AUTOMATIC.. wtf????? I wish I took a picture for you. Any yelper that is willing to try this place, please send someone to men rooms and take the picture and post it here.

{"text":"We had dinner here with our extended family in Toronto.  It's great Cantonese food at a reasonable price.  Unfortunately, I got too excited and started eating before I remembered to take pictures so I only have pictures of a small subset of what we ate.  My favorite dish was the garlic fried crab."}
{"text":"Sometimes my Yelpers are spot on.  Other times? Not so much.  My experience Hua Sang was somehere in between the two.

I was on a work trip with an adventurous colleague who, like me, prefers to rely on the kind words of Yelpers than some conciergy trendy monstrosity.  And the Yelpers swore by the Ginger and Green Onions Lobster so we were game. Our adventure began with a tenuous ride with cab driver who refused to openly admit that he had no clue where Baldwin Street was. It took him phoning a friend to land us on Hua Sang's doorstep.

Other than 2 very chatty young ladies, my colleague and I were the sole patrons.  We decided to take advantage of the 2-for-1 lobster deal.  We learned quickly that the \"deal\" didn't involve us ordering 2 separate lobster dishes, so we doubled up on the Ginger and Green Onions--which turned out to be delicious, though a bit of a challenge to eat.  

The lobster was basically dipped in the ginger and green onion batter, claws and shells and all.  Apparently, I slept through \"Lobster Consumption Sans Utensils 101\" and spent more time staring at the dish than eating it. The bit I did get to consume was yummy, but it was way too much work to get the lobster."}
{"text":"An oldie but a goodie. Whenever we're craving Chinese fried lobsters, this is the only place in Toronto we go to apart from Fishman Wharf in Markham. I've been going here for more then 15 years now and the flavour is consistent and the owner is always speedy and kind to his customers. We always get the Beef XO sauce noodles, Chinese broccoli with garlic, Fried Lobster with black bean sauce, and Fried Rice/Rice (which he gives to us on the house!) 

I see some mixed reviews on here as it being dingy, and the workers not speaking directly to the customers, which, I don't see as a problem. I guess I'm just used to it but Hua Sang is a very old establishment located at a basement but the dishes, teapots, table cloth are always clean. The workers are also just doing their job and don't have authority to tell you exactly what is what to customers. That's why the owner is always out in the hall tending to the customers in a speedy manner. Their demeanour may seem a bit passive and not always the friendliest but never took it personally."}
{"text":"This place once used to be a decent place to come to for lobsters and Chinese food. I'm compelled to write this review due to an experience I had tonight having had to host my cousin and her family from NYC visiting us over the weekend. 

This is about 5th time visiting Hua Sang over last 2 years and tonight, it has reached the absolute extremity in its level of disgust.

The entire place is infested with the cockroaches.  We had a party of 10 people and we placed an order for a bunch of stuff like lobsters, noodles, veggies and a fried rice dish. As we are waiting for the food, I felt we may be short of food so I asked for the menu again. As I opened up the menu, a cockroach fell from the menu and hurriedly ran away despite I was trying to step on it.  I felt disgusted but out of embarrassment, I kept it to myself.

The food came out and we went to work. Towards the end, my mom pulls me aside and tells me that there a cockroach. I was like, yeah I saw one too and she's like, \"I mean it's in the food\".... I was like WTF!!!  My sister passed me a folded up napkin and inside, there is a squished roach about an inch in length.  It came out of the FRIED RICE dish which I had some as well.  Disgusting!!!

I took it to the manager, and he was slightly apologetic and told me he will give me discount. I told him about the roach falling out of the menu at first and I tried to ignore it but having one come out of food was totally unacceptable.  He replies \"well, sometimes it happens in the kitchen, you know...\"
I'm like, whoaaaa!!?!  Then takes fried rice out of the bill and applies 2.8% discount. I was like are you kidding me?  Then knocks off another $10, which is another 5% or so discount.  Another female manager comes and says sorry twice half heartily..

So at this very moment, I'm fixing myself a glass of scotch as I'm writing his review in a hope to sterilize  whatever filth that may be looming in my stomach. 

Hua Sang needs to be shut down and city needs to inspect the entire place and send out exterminators.. if not, this place should NOT be in operation.

NOT EVENT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS EDIBLE.  I should have known, when they brought out nearly all 12 dishes 5 minutes after we ordered it that it wouldn't be good.  Actually our first clue, should have been the nearly empty parking lot outside, that only had about 5 cars in a potentially 100 car lot.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, they are known for their seafood and I made sure to mention this to my parents, so at least we didn't go completely hungry and each were able to nibble on what little meat there was in the lobster, most of it was just shell.  but it was the only decently flavored dish and the fried fish.  EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DISGUSTING.  The seafood fried rice looked and tasted burnt and the chow mein was by far the worst.  The noodles were too dry and the chicken tasted off.  So sad, because my parents paid nearly $200 for the meal and I feel guilty because I chose the restaurant."}

Delivery forgot our two orders of steamed rice and when it arrived it looked mushy and old. The duck was mostly fat so i didn't eat that. The chicken was dry and tasteless and the orange sauce didn't help any. The chicken balls and egg rolls were also a disappointment (the chicken ball was really just batter and a tiny bit of meat). I threw away so much.

What a waste of $60. Never again."}
{"text":"so if youve checked out the 8 pictures i put up on this one, youll see what i want to express.  if you cant see what it is then let me tell you:

GRRRRRRRRRRRR.

that grr is not because the food was bad or the service was bad or im bad.  its because YET AGAIN i was so looking forward to the food, so interested in spending time with my dad (who was there with me), and so goddamn hungry that I FORGOT TO TAKE PICTURES OF MY FOOD.  

so please focus on the ravaged table picture and know that the food, before the table, was ravaged.

now in my life i have worked towards not being an over-eater.  sometimes this is quite difficult to achieve, especially when the food looks and tastes so great.  it becomes even more difficult when its chinese food and you are eating it with only one other person.  in my family, and i dont think this is unusual at all, we like to order a whole bunch of dishes and share them - but its only in chinese restaurants we do this - with every dish.  so its just me and my dad and we order 4 dishes and 1 soup each and a beer a piece.  

we consumed virtually all of it.  we had:  one lobster deep fried with ginger and green onion, yet mein noodle dish with crab meat and vegetables, shrimp and vegetables with cashews, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, a minced beef soup for me and a hot and sour soup for him, plus two tsing tao beers.   seeing all that food felt like what it must have felt like for you enduring the length of the last sentence.

i didnt try his soup so i cant comment, but my soup was pretty good.  i still cant say that i love the glutinous style soup - glutinous is the kind word, it looks and feels like snot - and had i known that it would have been like that i might have reconsidered, but i was virtually closing my eyes and picking stuff off the menu so there you go.  

about five minutes after our scorching soups arrived, the lobster arrived.  bad timing i would say.  we could barely eat our soups they were so hot and all i could think about was trying that lobster, because i knew it was getting progressively colder as it sat there untouched.  so i actually stopped eating my soup and had some of it.  it was quite tasty, but i didnt quite get the outside shell of the lobster being breaded. (Lobster chips?)

then the chinese broccoli arrived.  if i knew it was going to be chinese broccoli i might have reconsidered, because i dont enjoy those as much as normal broccoli, but it was great to have something green and despite the fact that they are a bit hard to handle with chopsticks, they were quite tasty.

the shrimp and cashew dish was decent but pretty bland.  both it and the noodle dish to follow needed hot sauce to accompany it.  the noodles, though, had a nice consistency and were enjoyable.

they served us oranges at the end and fortune cookies of course.  mine was something like:  you take notice of lifes most beautiful things...

{"text":"Food:3
Service:2
I went to this restaurant with my friend and felt so disappointed.
Before I read some reviews online,all I care about is good food.
The lobster with black bean sauce was good but not the best.
The staff were impatient and not nice.We didn't feel we were welcome there.We have been to many restaurants .We never expect being spoiled  and either this.
But we still tipped them.
We could pay the same price to get the same food and better service in Chinatown.

So we never come back."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is certainly a huge upgrade from their downtown location. It's far more spacious, brighter, cleaner, and more modern. Unfortunately, it's a far way from home for me but I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday.

Hua Sang was always known for seafood so it's no surprise that we ordered lobster (lots), clams, squid, shrimps, scallops, oysters, and lots more food. Other than the clams, everything was excellent, including the efficient service. I enjoyed everything but my favourite dish was the sizzling chicken in hot pot.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We met friends for brunch here and checked out the Lobster with Ginger and Green Onion.  Highly recommend this.  We also had the King Mushroom and greens and rice... it was a wonderful wonderful.

They have a 2 for 1 special for $29.99 which seems perpetual, and so the meal was very reasonable.

They were many other tables around us enjoying the same thing -- so obviously a popular dish.

Check it out -- you won't be disappointed.

Note - we also tried the Escargot in Garlic Black Bean sauce and they were good but not traditional Escargot but rather what we call \"whelks\" -- we did see some other very good looking dishes going back and will check in again to sample at another time!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this second location. Their original location is located on Baldwin. Opened by the same owner. I loved  everything about this new location. Their lobster were fresh, juicy and tasty! Aside from their lobster we also ordered the egg white fried rice with dried scallop, Cantonese chow mien, fried clams with black bean and the double fried green beans in spicy sauce. Overall they were all qui 

The service was fast and really efficient. One of the waitress noted that they were short staffed but was still very attentive and came to our table to check on us several times. 

The decor of this location was spot on. It was bright, clean and spacious. Definitely an upgrade from their downtown location. I think I will be coming here more often now."}
{"text":"Team Ricky has taken the reigns! But nothing else has changed, this hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant serves THE BEST lobster in town. It's nothing fancy, but it's like eating something made by someone's grandmother: just deep fried lobster with ginger and garlic... heaven. Add on an order of snow pea leaves with garlic and Cantonese chow mein, and I'm a happy girl. Honestly, you don't even need the rest of it, the lobster on its own is just so DAMN GOOD, I'm drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"My uncle took me here on a late Saturday night. He had some difficulty finding parking as the street parking all along the street was taken.

Restaurant wise, fairly normal. The lobster was not anywhere as good as what I read below. Pretty average although I did like the black sesame beef on hot plate and some mushroom vegetable dish!"}
{"text":"Best black bean sauce lobster and ginger lobster in Canada, no one can beat this restaurant on these 2 dishes,"}
{"text":"I recommend this Chinese restaurant for deliciously flavored Lobster.  They have list of different flavors to chose from and the lobster comes out cut up for easy dinning.

The Asian style lobster is filled with great spicy flavors, the garlic flavored, was not as flavorful.  The Chinese rice was also great tasting and generous portion ingredients.  

I was pleased and the service was nice.  The waiter seemed to stand around staring at my daughter and I eat. We quickly discovered that is a cultural way of providing excellent service, as the waiter was available for our every need."}
{"text":"Now this was my first time going to a Chinese lobster restaurant. I had been told by many people that I have to try it and that it was best to go in a larger group. My group was only 5 people but I think we held our own as we were able to eat everything that came out. Saying this, there is a a lot of food and to make sure that the price doesn't get too ridiculous you need to have a large group. We had two orders of  the deep fried lobster, shrimp with black bean sauce and a steak dish on a iron plate with plain white rice. Everything we got was large and it was a little intimidating when it first came to the table but after each bite I wanted to eat more and more because it was so good. I am one of those people who loves to talk while I am eating but I don't think I said a word during the whole meal. I would like to try this place out again but with a
Bigger group. Reach out if you want to join our group?"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  It is authentic and clean and delicious and the owner is kind and quick for suggestions."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Went for lunch. We were the only customers there. But the service was slow. The food was very salty. My kids found a cockroach crawling on the floor. The lobster had barely any meat in it. The steamed shrimp dumplings dim sum took way too long to come out especially given we were the only customers there. They were overcooked and soggy. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Came here on 05/12/2015 for a belated Mother's day dinner with my family. I say dinner, but we showed up around 5:00 p.m. after we all finished work as our family tends to eat a little on the early side.

The place was quite empty for this time (to be expected), but the decor was great and the place was clean, which I love. I can't judge service properly, as it wasn't very busy, but we got all the attention we needed. We had been to the downtown location several times and this was no different, service was good and food was great.

We ordered the Lobster in the Ginger and Onion style, which was delicious. The lobster was fresh, cooked perfectly and the seasoning was a great mix of salty and sweet (not too much so). We also ordered the Fujian Fried Rice, which is made slightly different here than others, but we all enjoyed it very much. The rice was cooked much better than your standard Chinese take-out restaurant as we expected, and the familiar flavours were there in full. The last thing we ordered was a Straw Mushroom dish, we weren't too fond of the slimy texture it had, but the flavour was good. I didn't let this hurt the rating as I'm sure they executed the dish they way it is meant to, we just weren't fans of it.

Will definitely be back, much closer than the downtown location. Definitely recommend this place for lobster.

Cheers!

{"text":"Solid 3-3.5 stars for this visit. Came here Saturday night since my sister was craving lobster. On a Saturday evening they were fairly busy but we were able to get a table without waiting at all. First things first, there's this waiter who I have encountered and do not like. Unfortunately he came to take our order and spilled my sisters tea on the table. No sorry or nothing. Just brought napkins for us. Typical lol. 

We ordered snow peas with garlic, HK style lobster, E-fu noodles/yi mein and tofu with seafood soup. Usually soup is supposed to come out first but the vegetables did. So we're sitting here eating vegetables until the soup arrives. Everything seemed good but slightly on the saltier side. The lobster didn't seem as fresh for some reason either and it seemed like they cooked it different from the style we ordered. Oh well still good. 

At the end, there was no offer for dessert so I had to ask the waitress if there was tofu pudding. She brought out a huge bowl for us which is nice but doesn't make up for the crappy service and tea spilled we got from the waiter I don't like lol. 

I do agree that it's worth it to trek to Scarborough or Markham for better quality food. However since the DVP was closed this weekend, this was the best we could get in Chinatown."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me!

My family is a fan of Hua Sang. We used to go to the one on Baldwin but their service deteriorated significantly over the year. So we trek up here where the service is so much better. The owner/manager is so nice, talks to the customers and makes us feel welcome. The only thing they don't have here is the tofu dessert. We just got  oranges :(

My family ordered a few dishes, their famous lobster, filet mignon on a sizzling plate, oyster with ginger and onions, fried rice, general Tao chicken and snow peas with garlic etc. we wanted to try something new because we always order the same dishes. The lobster was good and the sizzling plate filet, fried rice were a hit but I wasn't a fan of their general Tao chicken or the oyster pot. I felt the portions didn't live up to what we paid. Maybe they just had an off day or we should stick to what we like because this visit wasn't my favourite!"}
{"text":"Best ginger and onion lobster in the city! Try out the snow pea shoots with oyster mushrooms and the shrimp fried rice! Generous portions and reasonable prices. Amazing deep fried soft shell crab too! Thumbs up! The venue could be slightly cleaner though"}
{"text":"1 star for how tasty the food was. The noodles were super crispy and the shrimps were large. But they lost all other 4 stars because of the amount of COCKROACHES I saw around the Resturant. EW EW EW. I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Service is good however the general Tao chicken here is not the same as the downtown location. Lobster is good here but the downtown location is better overall."}
{"text":"Come here and get the lobster special for two! I looked around the tables around us and it seemed like this is the dish to get when you are here. It's deep fried and seasoned with ginger and green onions, It's super tasty, and it's not wet/saucy as it is commonly prepared at other chinese restaurants. 
We also got their fried rice and seafood fried noodles. Both were not good in my opinion... Tasted very bland and seemed like the quality I would find in a messy home cooked meal. Just stick with the lobster.
The restaurant itself is quite nice to sit in, and feels very fancy! Great atmosphere for a group dinner."}
{"text":"After checking online lunch menu I decided to order take out. When I was paying I find out that lunch that advertised online is not the same , promised spring roll and soup is not included. I didn't like my order, pork was sometimes hard to chew. Price was good , but quality disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible experience there today. My mother told me that hua sang was having a 10% discount on take out orders so the lobster for two would be roughly 36-37 dollars. Thinking this was a great deal, my girlfriend and i called in and ordered the black bean sauce lobster special. Over the phone, they told us the total would be 41 dollars and change. We let them know that we were ordering for take out and that we would be paying cash. They proceed to get annoyed and tell us that its not possible and they never do such discounts. I then told them that my mother had gotten take out yesterday and received the discount and that they should honour the same for us. In response, they told us to come on over to the store and that the order is in already and that they would speak with the owner to honour the discount. So we head over to the restaurant and we step inside and the person we spoke to over the phone says that they cannot do the discount. We argued that it was unfair that we came all the way there thinking that we were getting the discount when in reality they didnt want us cancelling the lobster order that had already gone in the kitchen. After a few more minutes of exchange back and forth, the person says that he will allow us to have the dish for $40 flat and that they cannot do the 10% discount because the owner is the only one who can do such things. In response i asked if they could just call the boss and all they said was \"sorry. Cant do.\"
In the end, we were just really hungry so we took it for 40 dollars but cmon. It's not even the few extra dollars we are pissed off about. The fact that they offer certain people discounts and refuse it to others is just bad business regardless if it's just the owner's discretion or not. I dont mind paying regular price, but a pure bait and switch (when they told us they would honour the discount over the phone) just left a really bad taste in my mouth. Oh and to top it off, the man working gave us a five minute lecture on lobster market prices in different countries. Jesus christ. Their price is $36.95 before taxes to begin with. Taking a 10 percent discount paid in cash would still be $37. No wonder they only had 3 tables at 7 o clock peak dinner period. Never again.."}
{"text":"Lobster! 
My family used to come here often for the lobster which can we done in both ways. 
Both are good, but I love it in Black Bean sauce the most, however the food is about a 4 level. It's frequented a lot by Koreans who hear of how great it is, but it was not as good as it used to be in the olden days, back then it was like a 5.
I can't put my finger exactly on what's changed as I have been away for almost a decade, but it's still good, I will still go back. And as for their other dishes, they are more on the three star side, so go only for the lobster."}
{"text":"Our favourite place for lobster and other seafood dishes.  Service is good and foods are well prepared at decent price"}
{"text":"The value of this restaurant is going downhill for me.  They barely scratch a 1 star rating.

The meals quality and quantity has been declining over the past few visits.  Today was the last straw.  I will not be going back until there is a major change in their food quality.

As everyone usually does, we ordered the double lobster, with a myriad of other dishes.  The lobster now is a whopping $45.  That is a steep increase over the last year.  Going downtown for better seafood seems like a better option now.

The kids love Cantonese Chow Mein.  I don't...but the two can polish off a dish by themselves.  Unbeknownst to me, they burned the noodles and it polluted the whole meal with a smoke flavour.  The kids took generous helpings and then decided to stop eating it.  I took a lick and wow, what a disaster.  Almost $20 with tax and tip and they botched it.  They told me \"some people like crispy noodles\" - not only did one person tell me this, another server said the same things as he took it away.  No refund...and to make matters worse, not even an apology for serving what they should know was subpar food.  It is not the first time they served this dish and they should know what it should look like.  Shame on them for taking advantage of my kids and eventually me.

BTW -  their black bean chicken was mostly onions and peppers...they must have broke the bank with the slivers they served.

My family has been patrons of their restaurants since they opened.  Today, they angered the whole clan.  It was my birthday dinner and they could not have chosen a worse time to screw up a table.

For those who know me, knows I'm never looking for a free meal or even a refund on anything.  Just an honest apology without a stupid statement that implies we should accept charred food since others have said nothing.

Nuff said!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese seafood restaurant EVER. My family have been coming here for over 25 years. It is over an hour and a half drive to get here from where we live, but it is worth it for every penny. No other Chinese restaurant compares to this one in almost every city I have lived in.

The place is located downstairs, and the place is not the cleanliest but the food is amazing. 

The chef has changed, and were accommodating by creating a special dish that wasn't even on the menu for my family.

The 2 for 1 lobster special is their specialty, and my family LOVES it. 

The major problem is lack of parking. I spent about 20 minutes searching for street parking or lot parking which tends to make me feel a little agitated when I have spent over an hour in driving.

N.B. - The prices of the 2 for 1 lobster special went up from $29.95 to $36.95.
Also, for some reason the Dine T.O. website claims that it is closed down. This is untrue. They are up and running and have now a secondary location in Vaughan."}
