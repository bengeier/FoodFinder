{"text":"The only reason I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is because it is in the art museum. We called ahead earlier in the week for a Sunday reservation for lunch. I was told the cafe was not open on Sunday and that they only served brunch, which was wrong, but we decided to try the Restaurant and have brunch. After being seated it took over 5 min. to be approahed by our waitress, who told us about the table with the pasties and fruit and salad and told us to make sure and take our plates as there were none up there. Ok! Then said she would be right back to take our orders. No water in our glasses, and very thirsty, we waited over 15 min for her to return. We asked about beverages and specifically coffee, and were told they were not part of our brunch pricing. But we had to ask several more times to find out about coffee and the price and ask again for water before we were given an answer by a haughty waitress. At a price of over $20 for what was really breakfast, not a true brunch, the coffee at least should have been included and the waitresses attitude should have been excluded. 
Several of us ordered the lump crab quiche, which was almost inedible. The crust was so tough and over baked it was like leather and even the eggs were dry. It was accompianed by a very small citrus fennel salad which was good. We all left more than half of our quiches on our plates because it was so bad and ate what we ate because we were starved. The waitress had takrpen our bread plates off the table so we could not go back to the very small bread and salad table which was not refilled Nd mostly empty the entire time we were there. We had to ask them to refill the contents and theu only replaced the fruit. There was no jelly in the bowl, they were out of most of the pastries the rest of our meal. Our waitress never checked in on us through the rest of our meal and we had to ask the host to have someone bring us water and coffee. When our waitress returned to remove our plates, we told her about the quiche and she rudely told us they would have replaced it had we told her even though she had not been seen for over 20 min durring our meal. She never discounted our meal for such a bad product despite the fact that all three of us left most of it on our plates. We asked her to split the bills which she said she could not at first, but after being questioned did split the bill. We were very disappointed in our service and more so in a meal. $22 for a piece of quiche was not worth it and we will definately eat in the cafe next time as it outshone the restaraunt by a mile!"}
{"text":"I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of vegan options. There are a number of plant based items on the menu. However, the restaurant fails to accept that a large number of people looking for plant based foods need those foods to be prepared without the use of unnecessary animal products. One example is a black bean burger made with mayo mixed in. Another was on the Tandoori oven menu. I was told the nice looking rice pilaf and vegetable stew were vegan. But why would I spend $10.25 for that and not be able to eat the accompanying bread that was made with sour cream?

I finally settled on a vegetable salad from the salad bar. It had lettuce, zucchini, glazed pecans, etc. I was able to add tofu for $3, bringing it to about $11. I have to say it was very tasty. I can't confirm that it was 100% vegan though (? honey in the pecan glaze, vinaigrette dressing ingredients, etc.).

This brings me to another short coming: the lack of posted ingredients or signage. Many places now use symbols to identify foods that are vegan, vegetarian, etc. This is such a simple, effective technique that saves people from feeling self conscious by needing to ask.

This brings me to my final comment. Most of the kitchen staff there are VERY surly. I inquired about vegan options with three individuals at different stations. Only one of them was pleasant or made any attempt to be accommodating. The other two were clearly annoyed by my questions and one of them responded as though I was from another planet when I asked if the black bean burger was vegan. Really?? In 2015 in the cafe of a world class art museum?? Not how any customer wants to be treated in front of others.

Frustrating because just a few small changes would make this dining experience so much more accessible to those of us who don't consume animal products. Something tells me, though, that the management would resist such adaptations.

Oh, one more thing. A ton of delicious looking sweeties there. Needless to say, none of them vegan. 
:+\"}
{"text":"Good, but limited menu. I had the walleye, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Food was great service, service was superb beautiful, beautiful atmosphere. Love Cleveland Art Museum and the caf√© to boot.

We got the vegan stew and Field salad, couldn't of asked for anything better. Can't wait to go back and eat in the atrium again."}
{"text":"Great lunch for around $12 and a contemporary atmosphere in the Cleveland Museum of art.  The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed the sophisticated restaurant during our art break. Yummy bread and butter is included with your order too."}
{"text":"REally outstanding birthday dinner at Provenance!   We were in Cleveland for a convention and didn't know the restaurants well, but we looked at lists of \"Top 10\" and highly recommended restaurants and chose Provenance for my wife's birthday. We were not disappointed!  They had a lovely table overlooking the park waiting for us. The menu was really interesting and enticing, and our waiter was exceptionally warm and professional.  We loved our meals, and they gave us a free birthday dessert, as well. Such a nice experience and memory! When we're back in Cleveland, I know we'll want to go back to Provenance-  and also see more of the extraordinary Cleveland Museum of Art!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a morning at the natural history museum with two young children and was pleasantly surprised. I chose a tomato grilled cheese sandwich and absolutely loved it. I would go back here just for the sandwich even if I didn't plan on going to a museum, so it's really nice that the art museum is free! The only downside is that the food is kind of pricey. This is to be expected in a museum, but still a little hard to swallow, especially if you have kids with you who don't eat as much. Overall, it was good quality and in a nice environment- both the cafe itself and the museum."}
{"text":"My wife went here for brunch with some friends.  She said the service, food, and venue were absolutely flawless.  She especially loved how they were so accommodating for vegans and vegetarians, how her coffee cup was constantly being refilled, and the beautiful view of the lovely landscape.

She raved about it and said she would definitely return!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Cleveland.  Just had brunch there this morning.  Looks like they have read the comments from earlier this year.  The service was excellent.  The Chef's table was impressive ... house made yogurt, granola, and a great micro greens salad ... Miso dressing was very tasty, but for some maybe a bit too much garlic, not for me though.  The highlight of the chef's table (btw, the chef's table is where you load up) was the pastries.  Croissants both plain and chocolate stuffed were superb, light and flaky.  Coffee (which i gauge a restaurant by) was excellent.  Ordered the \"Croque Madame\" for my entree ... It was well seasoned, well flavored and served just as I finished my yogurt, granola, croissants and salad.  Am a CMA member so I got the discount ... My total bill (before tip) was $19.19.  I'd say that is very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Nice ambiance and my waiter told me not to rush.  Will definitely go back.  Btw, if you don't like an item on the menu, let's say you don't want Eggs Bennie with trout, they will happily swap the trout out for ham or something else.  I like the fact that thy will work with you."}
{"text":"Definitely a huge step up from your typical museum cafeteria experience.  I love the wide variety of flavors they offer, as well as the many healthy options.  I'd give them a 5 but I think there is a little room for improvement.  I had a cold noodle salad on my most recent visit that was good, but needed something to give it a bit more flavor, maybe some lime juice or jalapeno.  On my previous visit I ordered a sandwich and fries from the tandoor oven station, but by the time the got around to making the fries, the sandwich had been sitting already for quite a while and was very soggy."}
{"text":"YUM!

This cafe is superb! I went here on a Friday afternoon and what a great experience. The food options were hard to choose from and all affordable! 

I ordered one of the \"melty sandwiches\" of the day which consisted of ham, cheese and spiced apples with a honey dijon cream cheese (which was to die for) and then it was heated in the stone oven until the cheese was melted. With the sandwiches and flat breads you also receive a small arugula salad with this delectable lemon vinaigrette which is subtle but packed with flavor. 

I also got a fresh baked cookie with white chocolate and cranberries. I am not a sweets person but the sight of these cookies- my eyes made me order one and my taste buds were not disappointed!

What a great add-on to the Art Museum!"}
{"text":"Provenance Cafe is in the Cleveland Museum of Art. The food is good.  I think the serving size is small compared to the price. After spending $15 on braised beef stew over rice, and a drink, I finished eating my lunch and was left hungry and immediately started thinking about my next meal.  My petite wife had a wedge salad and soup and she was still hungry too.  I would go somewhere else to eat next time."}
{"text":"I was visiting the museum with my daughter during a Parent Weekend at her college, and decided to eat here because, well, it was really really cold outside and we were hungry.  

What a pleasant surprise!  

My daughter had a made-to-order sandwich and I added a \"soup on the side\".  Not only the pumpkin soup hot and delicious, it filled me.  We shared a lemon bar for dessert and that was also really good.  

The staff are helpful and pleasant. And, while I guess it might be pricey for Cleveland, it was just about what I would pay in NYC for some pre-packaged, off-site fare.  I would actually stop by for a bite, not necessarily to browse the museum, which I also loved, but that's a whole other review."}
{"text":"Anything better than this in Cleveland is impossible! Okay, I am not talking about the food but the whole package. 

Think about the package, free entry and coatcheck in a meuseum + large atrium in winter+ outdoor seating in winter + people watching + many gourmet options. Now that is a great deal, even better in summer when they have outdoor concerts! 

Food here is awesome and they have very innovative options on their cafeteria style menu. I have had their burgers, sandwiches, dessert, tea and coffee and asian fusion food. Everything has been great. 

Perfect place for a date!"}
{"text":"Best brunch ever!  Handcrafted bloody mary, mimosa, or the best direct trade coffee I've ever had.  Truly this farm to table experience is nearly worth the price of the plane ticket to Cleveland!  East coast folks will take a double take at the bill as I did - since this meal was less than half of what I expected - based on brunch in NYC (i.e. Landmarc)."}
{"text":"It's decent museum food and decent prices. I got a melty tuna sandwich that came with a side of spinach salad, small bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, and jalape√±o chips for $25

The ambience is modern deco. You're allowed to take your purchased alcohol outside the restaurant but not into the museum. 

I would visit next time I'm at the museum"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I assumed it would be better than the first. Our food was alright. Nothing with the wow factor but I do not appreciate having a condiment spilled on me and not getting any sort of an apology from the waitress who did it. A sorry would have even been ok but she was in such a hurry to flip tables and get us out of there. We had to specifically ask for a dessert menu before she rushed to get our check and we weren't even give the chance to order an appetizer. Train your servers better and people will return!
On a plus note, the bartender named Matt did his job very well and maybe if I do go back I will just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Very elegant space. We sat at the bar. We were told since we didnt have reservations. Well the restaurant was 80% empty. Hmmm. Anyway the barkeep was entertaining, gave recommendations and we were happy with out choices. Its a bit pricey and the chefs table brunch was not too impressive.  Coffee is served in tiny mugs but refills were granted. I think i had 4 refills. Anyway it was our farewell to cle brunch. A beautiful space in a beautiful museum (free too!)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an amazing ambiance. The staff was more than friendly and made sure they accommodate us when 2 extra people were joining us for brunch. However, they mentioned they were overly booked for brunch, during our 2 hour stay only 3 out of all the tables were filled.  Most of the restaurant was empty. The drinks were great, yet the food was below average. All our friends complained that everything was too salty, and my trout meal was \"meh\". I know for a fact that the food in the provenance cafe next door is of higher caliber and taste."}
{"text":"As I get older, I appreciate the finer, simpler things. 

As a gift for my birthday, my wonderful wife took me to Provenance Cafe at the Cleveland Museum or Art. I appreciate art, in paint, in sculpture and especially, in food. 
This is a place of artistry. 

The food and courses we were given were by no means cheap, but then, quality IS by no means cheap; the food was WONDERFUL. I had things like a \"compressed\" watermelon salad, a cheese tray with hand-made crisps and scallops in a wonderful bed of vegetables. The service was great, and they even make the simple dessert of rice pudding into a piece of edible art. 

As this establishment is in the museum, parking is handled by them, but overall the food (and the cocktails at the wonderful bar,) are all done with care and the customer is treated like a king. 

So, if you want art for your eyes and mind, by all means, visit the Cleveland Museum of Art. If you want art for your pallet and soul, then stop off at Provenance Cafe:)"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was enjoyable with a seat with a view of a grassy knoll and a sunny sky. The cappuccino was standard, if small for the price. I had the Scezchuan trout. I would pass on the ginger tartar sauce if I ordered this again. The hungry man suggests you pass on the biscuits and gravy. The highlight of the meal was the bacon. Thick cuts, chewy and crisp at the same time. The service was impeccable. Would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"A simple, yet elegant menu full of flavor. Great for an intimate dining experience, all while right in the Art Museum.

I've been to the CMA plenty of times before and had never seen this restaurant! It is tucked right to the left of the Cafe area, if you walk to the corner. We came to meet friends for their Saturday brunch menu. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the choices on here. There aren't a lot of options, for good reason. Each plate is carefully crafted, each ingredient thoughtfully selected so that you are left feeling satisfied. I got the Crab Cake Sandwich, which a friend of mine had suggested. The fennel apple slaw added a nice crunch and refreshing contrast to the heavier crab cake and pork belly slice. It came with delicious smashed potatoes, which were still crunchy on the outside but creamy on the inside. I couldn't resist and also got a side of the sage sausage, which went nicely with the meal. I was delightfully stuffed from everything (without feeling weighed down); I probably would not eat the top bun if I got it again. My friend ordered the amazing Calabrian Fried Chicken which came on top of a cornmeal waffle. This was honestly the FIRST thing that I saw on the menu and would have gotten it if my friend had not suggested the crab cake. The fried chicken was not greasy, as you usually get with a \"chicken and waffles\" plate, and the housemade relish also paired well with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't think it was very spicy, so I would have liked it a little spicier BUT I have a high spice tolerance and we didn't want to ask for hot sauce to change the flavor of the overall dish. I'm getting this the next time I come for the the brunch menu.

The Provenance restaurant is geared towards more of a smaller, intimate kind of dining experience, in my opinion. The staff here was wonderful and very attentive. I was hesitant about the prices for everything on the menu, but I would come back for a special occasion or just to treat myself once in a while. It may also be a bit pricier because of its location within the CMA. But hey, the CMA is free admission, so I'd love to show my support by paying a little more at their in-house restaurant."}
{"text":"Very busy during lunch.  I had to wait 15 minutes in the hearth line. There was only one person working this station where as the other unpopulated stations (salad, burger, tandoor) had 2 people working them.  I got a roast beef and cheddar melt that had sauteed onions and a banana pepper relish.  It came with an arugula salad with Parmesan and a lemon vinaigrette.  Both were tasty.  I was able to sit next to the trees in their sun filled indoor atrium which was nice on a cold day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited the caf√© today and found the food to be very good quality. The staff was nice and I saw them act particularly accomadatingly to another patron who was gluten free. 
  The main reason I'm taking off stars is the wait-time and crowd management. 
  The caf√© quickly became crowded with many people confused as to where lines started and ended. Even worse, the time it took to get food was borderline ridiculous. I had to wait 15 minutes to get a salad, my boyfriend waited triple that for a burger.
  If Provenance Caf√© works on cutting line time down and setting up more clearly defined systems, this will easily be a 5-star review"}
{"text":"High praise for Provenance Cafe, a small cafe in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Clean, modern space with plenty of dining areas in the atrium or in the cafe itself.

I'm commenting mostly on the tandoor grill. First of all, they have an actual tandoor oven where they make handmade naan for their sandwiches/wraps. My husband and I shared the wrap since we weren't too hungry. It was a fairly large portion for one person. We ordered the house made falafel, and I think it may be some of the best falafel I've had in Cleveland.

All the flavors work. Fresh garlic naan, refreshing pickled vegetables, cucumber and tomato, marinated eggplant, hummus, and red spread that we can't remember. The falafel was not shy on flavor and spices-something hard to find in a city that tries to cater to bland Midwestern palettes. Highly recommend this sandwich with the garlic fries. 

Pair it with a pair of pears and you are good to go!

PS they sell local baked goods- gouchere and macarons from Luna Bakery."}
{"text":"I got the Ham and Cheese on multigrain bread sandwich and it was very weird. The bread was very dry and the ham was all fatty, making it hard to chew. Overall, the sandwich was not worth 7 dollars and there was too much mustard 3 stars because everything else seems ok. If the guy getting an interview next to us gets hired, we'll forget about the bad sandwich."}
{"text":"The perfect lunch to go with a day at the museum.  Excellent food and service.  Started with the Artisanal Cheese platter.  Great selection.  Honey with Gouda was the best.  Finished with the Cavatelli pasta.  Very tasty.  Ordered the 86 Sleep as a cocktail.  While the drink was outstanding, I should have ordered something that would be better paired with the food.  The 86 Sleep has espresso in it and would have been better as a dessert.  Overall great meal and would definitely go out of my way to go back here."}
{"text":"I loved the variety of the food and was very appreciative that it was not your average prepared offsite, packaged in plastic cafe type food.  You do have to wait but it is prepared fresh and is definitely worth the wait.  The kitchen does seem to need a bit better coordination.  Lots of people sometimes standing around doing nothing but waiting for others.  Still, I liked the ambiance, and ability to eat in the atrium (or inside the cafe) and appreciated the fresh and healthy alternatives to what is typically provided at a museum cafe.

I did not mind the multiple stations as it kind of kept the lines and crowds down.  The kitchen just needs better management.

We had the tandor sandwiches which were delicious.  Naan flat bread with harissa, cucumber yogurt, hummus, eggplant and your choice of protein (we had chicken and falafel).  Both were delicious and came with a fresh side salad."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic cafe in the Cleveland Museum of Art. It has a wide selection of healthy and upscale items at reasonable prices. Fresh salads, tandoori, etc.

A very welcome and pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch options, good chicken blt with arugula salad, excellent flat bread with salami, and vegetable flat bread, as well. Scrumptious cookies!! There is a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The bad reviews here are silly.

This is a snack bar at a public facility. 

Provenance Cafe raises the bar well out of reach for FAR inferior snack bars at places like The Salvador Dali Museum in St Pete and The Met and The Cloisters both in NYC. There are so many actual food choices here, I've come solely to eat at the cafe on occasion. I like that they have healthy beverage choices too.

Someone mentioned the crowds...we should be so lucky to have nice crowds in Cleveland now. It's fun to sit at a table and converse with the folks at the next, who are more and more likely to not be from the U.S.

Get the swordfish sandwich."}
{"text":"The location and view are great, just don't order anything.Our service was slow as was the wait to talk to the manager. Our potatoes were cold and our eggs crispy/tough on the bottom and not at all sunnyside up as ordered."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Cleveland for the Easter Weekend and not being from this metropolis, I asked my sister to find us a place to eat. My sister made reservations to Provenance for Easter brunch.

I really enjoyed my time here. Firstly, this restaurant is in a museum ! How cool is that?! Secondly, the decor of the Provenance is quite chic; the large windows with a great view of the gardens is so nice. Thirdly, the food isn't all that bad. I had the egg & potato strata, which was quite tasty. I also enjoyed the goat cheese & chive muffins. Fourthly, the service was fantastic - everyone was super friendly and attentive. My server noticed that I needed a refill of joe before I did!

The meal is a little on the pricier side, but the way I figure, you're getting an awesome experience and you're supporting the Cleveland Museum of Art. 

Great for: out-of-towners, appreciators of art, nice meal"}
{"text":"We went for lunch here last weekend. This is a modern-american restaurant that takes on the theme of \"food as art\". This is reflective of the fact that it sits at the heart of the Cleveland Museum of Art. The newly-renovated Museum itself is a gorgeous space (more on that in a separate review coming up). The modern art theme continues into the bar and the small restaurant that happens to be owned by Douglas Katz, the same chef of \"fire food and drink\" fame. There are floor to ceiling windows that give a great view of the outside landscape.

This is not to be confused with Provenance Cafe -- which is next door and it is a food court which I have not tried, yet.

The Van Gogh exhibit was up that week, and special menu was Van Gogh-inspired. It would have been comical had they put pig ears on the menu, but I digress...

Here's what we ordered: thai calamari for starters, mac and cheese for the kid, pan roasted ohio trout for entree, and \"draadjesvlees\" (beef stew) entree from the dutch-themed specials.

The calamari. This is an example of calamari done right: soft, crunchy, non-greasy and not over-battered. The thai-chili sauce on the side had smoky-sweet flavor that seemed like an asian take on barbecue sauce. Cilantro was mixed in with the calamari.

I'm a big fan of trout. I love trout with the skin on. They did just that. The skin was seared -- even better. I love trout because, among most fish, it can easily take on a smoky flavor. It was served hot. The lentils on the side provided a great balance.

The draadjesvlees was beef stew, braised right. Slow-cooked, maybe with a hint of red wine as far as I could tell -- just a guess, but the result was juicy and tender comfort food perfect for that winter afternoon!

I am coming back. Coming back to this lovely museum and to this great restaurant. These are Cleveland treasures."}
{"text":"I had been here during the week for lunch a long time ago, and we came in again for brunch yesterday.  It was pretty empty, though a few more parties trickled in while we dined.  Perhaps it was because it was brunch as opposed to weekday brunch, but there was no bread service this time.  This was a bit disappointing because I recall my son really enjoying the bread last time.

At first, the restaurant reminded me of some of the museum restaurants in NYC, like the Modern inside MoMA or Untitled inside the Whitney Museum, but less pretentious and with fewer offerings.  There is a nice clean look to the restaurant with a few tastefully picked pieces of artwork throughout.  We sat in the main dining area, but I believe there is another sitting area inside.  

While the feel of Provenance reminded me of the Modern, the food does not compare.  It is far from being of Michelin quality; other than being prepared well (technique and seasoning were spot on), there is nothing particularly special about it.  They do pay attention to the presentation though, which is only fitting for being located in a museum of art.  My mother-in-law's latke came with a few slices of smoked salmon, shaped into a pretty pink rose.  While tasty, the food is not Michelin quality like the Modern but is still very good.  Prices are a bit high and the portions can be small, depending on what you order.  I had the szechuan trout, which despite being the most expensive item on the menu was definitely the smallest and left me hungry.  The fish was cooked well, though it may have been overcooked simply because it was such a thin piece of fish -- even the server said, \"it's hard to see but the trout is in there\" when placing it in front of me.  I did appreciate the crispy skin.  To my dismay, there was nothing particularly szechuan about it, save for the light dusting of crushed szechuan peppercorns on top that one can barely taste.  A ginger tartar sauce accompanied the dish, but ginger is not a szechuan flavor.  I think it would've been better to have the szechuan peppercorn in the tartar sauce instead, or better yet skip the tartar sauce altogether in favor of a more authentic szechuan sauce.  A few more greens would've at least make me feel like I had more than an almost unfindable piece of fish and an egg with some vegetable garnish.  Out of the four dishes we ordered (trout, calabrian chicken and waffles, latke, and lamb burger), my favorite was the lamb burger, which is of decent size and quite tasty.

The place is beautiful, and it is not cheap, but it's a nice place to take out-of-towners or to go to for a special occasion without totally breaking the bank.  For a cheaper option with comparably tasty food, try the more casual Cafe next door."}
{"text":"This is such a near place. The space offers a peaceful calm just off to the side of the busy museum. It has a modern design and clean lines, but also offers cozy seating near the bar and breathtaking views near the windows. My boyfriend and I decided to grab a cocktail and small bite of food after exploring the museum and this was a perfect stop to do that. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and asked the bartender if the aioli came on the side, noting that because of allergies I cannot have it, but still wanted it so my boyfriend could enjoy. She said yes and places our order after making our cocktails. Both were ok-a little too sweet for either of our tastes-but inventive nonetheless. When our food arrived (very quickly I might note) she said \"the aioli is actually mixed in, hope that's ok\" and began to walk away. Fortunately we stopped her and got a new plate made up for us. And let me tell you-this was some of the best tasting food I had the entire time I was in cleveland. Skip the cocktail, order a $5 chimay, Brussels sprouts, and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Four stars. 

The food is decently priced and the arugula salad that came with tuna melt sandwich was pretty fresh. There are indoor as well as outer sittings overlooking the beautiful museum atrium. With a good amount of sunlight floating in,  having lunch over a glass of wine makes you feel like you are on a vacation. The dessert pastries looked pretty decadent with very reasonable prices ($2-$3). I know I will be paying the double amount back in NYC. The museum is free entrance (!). I would definitely come back for lunch if I worked in the area. Pretty good overall; pretty great for museum food."}
{"text":"My generation is from the days when public buildings were lavish and awe inspiring. Theaters had red velvet and gilt; public buildings had marble staircases and frescoes. No matter our socioeconomic situation we were surrounded with luxury. Times have changed with warehouse stores replacing elegant department stores and minimalist replacing extravagant.

Provenance with its Atrium seating appears to delight the younger generation. For me the cafe is very much like a factory cafeteria and the atrium very much like a bus terminal. Having to go from one food station to another to see what is available is annoying at busy times when customers crowd the counters. Prices match the quality of the food, meaning above average.  The outdoor seating at the former lunch room is missed. 

I welcome most changes and am thankful to still be here to benefit from them. At times I do miss a little luxury and a bit of pampering. The art museum is most likely the place I have been to most in my life. In future visits contrary to what I have written I will dine at the cafe and buy things at the gift shop. Our museum charges no admission fee. The least I can do is find ways to spend money there."}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the glowing reviews for Provenance. My experience was mediocre at best! My family and I went for brunch and the service was pretty terrible. Definitely not the level of attention one would expect from a place that charges $20 a plate for breakfast food! Our waitress was frequently MIA, and when my crab quiche first arrived it was cold. I asked the waitress if she could heat it up, and she took so long in the kitchen that the rest of my party had mostly finished their meals before my food showed up again. Also, those with allergies be warned: my mother ordered the poached chicken waldorf salad, and was rather peeved to discover that it contained onions, which was definitely not listed in the menu description.

I was also very disappointed in the \"chef's table\" as most of the options were pretty picked over (hardly any fruit) and not replenished the entire time we were in the restaurant. Decor is very boring: modern, but more reminiscent of an office park than a high-end eatery. Given the fact that Provenance is located inside an art museum of all places, I expected it to be much more visually stimulating.

The food itself was tasty, and the reason for three stars instead of two. But I don't think I would ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here over the holidays when they were just getting started so I hope that since then some of the kinks have been worked out. I had take out lunch from the cafeteria side of the restaurant and ate out in the atrium to take in the beauty of this new space inside the art museum. I ate a special grilled cheese topped with sun dried tomatoes - it was delicious! Ordering can be a bit awkward as you have to wait in line to order, then again as your food is being prepared. The food was good but I'd probably skip the dining hall experience and get lunch before the museum at Euclid Tavern next time."}
{"text":"Provenance at the Cleveland Museum of Art is off to a great start with lots of room to grow! 

Let's start with the great stuff: 
Atmosphere is chic and modern without making you feel like a pretentious jerk-face for eating lunch there. (Yea, normally my lunch consists of eating miscellaneous items from my fridge in front of my computer...so what?) I loved the textures in the wall decor and the minimal whites, chrome of the tables and chairs and dark grey floors. But the real showstopper was the festive view, featured through the entire wall that's a window facing outside! It's nothing crazy, but really, really natural and pretty with lots of evergreens. It gives the whole room some warmth and natural tones. The vibe certainly fit the new atrium of the Museum.

The food was super-creative and very tasty! I loved the ever-changing menu of special dishes made to coordinate with whatever exhibit is being featured at the Museum. BUT I couldn't help but try something off their regular lunch menu--scallops? Yes, please! Perfectly seared, served with crunchy, roasted kale, fingerling potatoes and roasted fennel (which I normally hate, but loved here!) My only complaint was that it didn't need the additional olive oil drizzled on top, since the roasted veggies already had enough. The result was almost too oily, but not quite. My very handsome man tried the Moroccan spiced chicken and I didn't hear one complaint from him as he cleaned his plate. But my favorite item? The roasted garlic soup--I know, it doesn't sound like it would be interesting, but it was amazing. Just try it (I almost licked the bowl...) 

Now, here's where there is room for improvement: 
Although the service was super-sweet, they all seem like they would benefit from a confidence boost. Our waitress seemed to fumble over a lot--like a LOT. I watched her pour a beer for another table and it overflowed everywhere. She then walked out with dishes from the kitchen and had to turn around because the food moved everywhere on the plate and fell over... She didn't seem to have a hard time pronouncing anything, but she just seemed really uncomfortable, as did some of the other servers. This is something I do believe they'll work out after a while. They're new--remember that. 

Overall, I'd definitely come back for a lunch date at the Museum and definitely to try a dinner service. I think they only have dinner service on Wednesdays and Fridays from 5-9PM, so just keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place but it just isn't working out. They really need to work on their customer service. I have been 3 times since January and the service is just lacking. Asking for refills on wine rarely happens. Food has come out cold. 

For a restaurant in the art museum I would expect better than a mall food court experience in the restaurant.

If you are finishing up your meal and it is somewhat near closing on a Friday night dinner security will approach you tableside. It has been embarrassing when dining with out of town guests and you are getting pushed out before the bill arrives.

I'm a member of the museum. I just wish the service would improve."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place was.  Something has to be done about management.  My husband, father- in-law and I went there to grab lunch. When we arrived I went to the salad line and the two people behind the counter said nothing, so I asked if I could order a salad and the woman started telling the other man behind the counter how there is no salad because she was alone, and continued to go on about her terrible day.  I get up to the cashier and they were having problems with taking credit cards and the manager is up there saying she did not want to bring in the back up machine unless it was necessary.  At this point the line was ten people deep.  On top of all of this the \"barista/cleaning grunt\" was yelling out if people needed coffee and then started singing a rap song....not the kind of attitude I would want at the art museum cafe.  But all of this could be solved with management.  It is obvious there is no training, no sense of urgency, and no customer service... Hopefully they can clean it up quickly.  We ended up walking out, by the way.  Went to the cafe in the museum of natural history."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday Brunch.  Wonderful experience!  There is a menu of classic breakfast and lunch items.  Included with each entree is the chef's table - which contains various continental breakfast items such as yogurt, fruit, croissants and other pastries.  Simple items such as scrambled eggs and bacon are upgraded in flavor and presentation.  the short rib hash is hearty beyond words but very good.  The meat is mixed with potatoes and cheddar cheese.  Add some scramble eggs and sourdough toast and you have this amazing menu item.  Their take on eggs benedict is also exceptional - yes the hollandaise sauce is very tasty.  There is a nice selection of breakfast cocktails and a wine list.  Prices are a bit high, but one would expect this for the location.  Service was very good.  The only down side for me was the visual appeal - there is no view.  If there was a view of the museum atrium, for example, this would add to the experience.  Even a view of the outdoors would be nice.  I have not tried other times during the week to dine, but plan to in the future.  For those planning a visit, I definitely would recommend making reservations, as the dining room is small, and fills quickly."}
{"text":"We had lunch here. Ordered Curry Mussels B-, Young hare dijon B-, Local lamb claybread C, Rhubarb strudel D. Ambiance was nice but a bit boring, Service was \"kind of nice\" but forgetful and not professional. Value was bad for the experience received. No coming back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot to grab lunch within the museum. Members get 15% off."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a beautiful setting in the Museum Of Art.  Each table has a wonderful view.  The service is excellent.  To other cities with their museum restaurants: \"Eat your hearts out.\""}
{"text":"Exceptional dining facility in one of the greatest free museums. Definitely don't expect extra quick service in the middle of rush- my food was prepared fresh, and in front of me. But sitting in the atrium eating a a delicious Mediterranean pasta salad looking at this hidden temple-esque marble facade... You can't put a time stamp on that kind of experience. Price point is solidly middle-of-the-road for attractions in the city, but quality far exceeds others.

Pro tip: pay for your food right after you place your order. It helps kill time while they prepare your food in front of you and you can eat your food fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I feels a little weird writing about the cafeteria of a museum, perhaps because there often really isn't much to write home about. Man, did the Provenance Caf√© impress though!

I will disclaim that I am an art geek and that maybe my jaunt around the gallery worked up a biased appetite. However, I've been to many museum caf√©s and the Provenance Caf√© definitely stands out as one of the best by miles. What they offered was simple, yet executed beautifully with much flavor. You'd think that a cold slab of pre-cooked salmon that's been sitting in a glass box wouldn't taste good, but it was! Their gazpacho was the best that I've had in recent memory. Every biteful brought a smile to my face!

I know where I'll be visiting next time I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"Honestly I will eat even eat paper sprinkled with glue or even hay within the walls of this temple of art. It's all about presentation and the Provenance does a job as good of a job as Impressionists on the second floor: food is very artistically introduced. I wish I could just watch my plate instead of eating it: but trout in my eggs benedict was calling my name. Unfortunately it was just ok. My fianc√©e's waldorf salad had two rusty globes of iceberg salad with some stale chicken and nuts. I had to give him the half of my egg benedict since after all, I am marrying this man. 
I understand it's upscale, but I thought that America loves to eat away even at upscale brunches. Choices were limited, drinks were just ok. The man at the table next to us warned not to order the French toast with this very sweet cutting the throat gesture.
We left hungry and disappointed, wishing we ate at the museum cafeteria next door.
But of course we decided to fill up spiritually instead and marched tall and proud into the Pompeii exhibition."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Cleveland Institute of Arts Museum and arrived for our Doscent lead tour a bit early,  We had reserved paid tickets for a special exhibit but were hungry when we arrived.  So we asked the person at the check-in desk if we could exchange our tickets for a later tour and that was done for us.  We used the time to grab something to eat and there were two choices at the Museum.  One was a sit down restaurant and the other was the Provenance Caf√©.  After looking over the menus for both, we decided on the Caf√©.  The sit down restaurant was quite pricy IMO and the menu offerings were not particularly exciting.

On the other hand, there were quite a few choices that looked appetizing to us on the Caf√© menu.  The menu included salads, soups, hamburgers and other grill items, international dishes and other hot and cold specialties.

I had a nice cheeseburger plate that came with fresh cut French fries.  The burger was served on a grilled brioche bun and it was also served with crisp lettuce, sliced tomatoes, Bermuda onions and pickle slices.  My wife had a bowl of cream of broccoli soup that had big chunks of ham in it and a toasted flat bread that was grilled with cheese and fresh veggies.

The food was good, but of course since this is a museum, the prices are not cheap.  I think we paid about $ 30.00 before a discount was applied because of our Detroit Institute of Arts membership which reduced the cost by about 10 percent.

Museum, restaurants can be horrible.  But this one was great."}
{"text":"Very frustrated. Walked in at 11 and they are still setting up, no one has acknowledged is standing here for 4 minutes. I hope the food is better than their service."}
{"text":"Provenance has some strong pros and strong cons. We weren't touring the museum, but I invited a friend here for brunch to meet her newborn.

Pros:
+ The ambiance is elegant. It has big windows with landscape views that are quite picturesque. We had a great snowy view!
+ For a museum, the food is chef quality. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles and a bloody mary.
+ Excellent staff. Our server was wonderful!

Cons:
+ The menu prices are expensive, but I suppose that comes with the territory of being a restaurant inside a museum.

+ I had a weird moment trying to enter here. I was carrying 2 small baby presents for my friends newborn. All around me, there were strollers/double strollers, students with huge backpacks, etc. However, a guard stopped me in the Atrium to inform me I couldn't bring them in. He said I couldn't take them in Provenance and the issue was \"How it is perceived.\" Um, what? He asked me what was in them. I mentioned a book and onesies for the mom and newborn I was meeting. He said another problem was, \"We sell books in the bookstore\" (side note: I doubt the CMA bookstore carries Dr. Seuss). He put up a pretty weird fight with me. But legit, shouldn't you be searching those huge double strollers and backpacks? My duck onesie and board book in a gift bag are hardly suspicious.

+ I digress, but here's the moral of the story: Provenance is not a good choice for a celebration, birthday, etc. When they call you the day before to confirm your reservation, they should consider telling people they cannot bring anything in. I would love to use the space for celebrations, but it's not realistic.

Overall: Provenance is a fine choice if you're in the museum already and need a quick bite, but I would not go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Upscale, urban and very comfortable, Provenance is the perfect place to rest after perusing the galleries. The restaurant looks out to wildlife and trees, bright in early-winter afternoon sun. The space is intimate and small, just right for a dinner for two. 

The crepes were lovely, the creme caramel very light, the perch and ravioli big hits. The wine list is acceptable, though the full bar promises better cocktails. Very nice overall. 

However, the staff were a bit of an embarrassment. In the museum of art, the waitstaff should be able to pronounce their dishes (our server didn't even try to say the French dishes, and she cut me off when I ordered the crepes by their name), and more importantly, their themes. The server couldn't pronounce Mary Cassat's name correctly. In a museum. Featuring a Mary Cassat exhibit not 100 feet away and Mary Cassat menu. Really?"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Just horrible.  Food was cold, grill chef was in prepared for any orders. Burned fries and had to start over. We waited well over 15 minutes for a burger.  Chef was just standing around.  Melted cheese sandwiches were not melted.  Waaaaay over priced for the quality.  Horrible. Hit the food trucks outside."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch and dinner. Would love to catch lunch but don't work in the area.  The food has been unbelievable over the last couple of months. On the brunch menu you have to try the short rib Benedict or the pain perdu.  Check it out it's worth it"}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland, on a road trip, getting lunch. This was a perfect way to get a glimpse of University Circle and the Museum, since we didn't have time to explore. Surprisingly our meal for two was under $20! For a museum cafe, that's impressive. And everything was delicious. Great service. Creative menu items. And you can sit in the atrium, which is lovely. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Was at the museum on a rainy Sunday, needed a quick lunch.  The cafeteria style arrangement in Provenance Cafe is pretty affective.  Several culinary stations to choose from, I got the curry chicken stew w/ naan and butter, along w/ a macaroon.   A tasty lunch, reasonably spicy, got me filled up and ready to go off and wander more exhibits."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant, so this will be short: Food, service, ambiance - all perfect!  Looking forward to my next visit.  I live in Virginia but I will now make a excuse to go to Cleveland to visit the museum and especially this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very very nice and creative brunch menu. We shared the short rib Benedict and the corn pancake with cured salmon - also their house blended blackberry pomegranate and orange juice. Nummy. Lovely setting."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday Brunch! Great food & service.  I started my meal with a Bloody Mary & then visited their Chef's table which included muffins,  salad, various breads & yogurt with toppings.  Then your meal that you ordered is delivered to your table, I ordered the scrambled eggs with Nueski Bacon & my husband had the smoked salmon with all the toppings & he said one of the best bagels he has ever had. Both breakfasts were wonderful. My eggs were absolutely wonderful & the bacon perfectly cooked.  I would love to eat here again. Very relaxing views too."}
{"text":"A restaurant that is fancy, chill, and affordable: Provenance is all of these things.  I base my review on my recent experience co-planning and attending a semi-private brunch event here.  The quick version: it went wonderfully and the price was excellent.

The setting of the restaurant in the western side of the atrium of the Cleveland Museum of Art is absolutely gorgeous.  The interior of the restaurant is equally aesthetically pleasing.  I love the palette of black, white, and grey, and the floor-to-ceiling windows opening out onto the lush and verdant trees.  Provenance is a large space, with three distinct areas of restaurant seating and a back room that can be portioned off with dividers for semi-private events like the one that my mother and I planned to celebrate my graduation from PhD school.  

Nicole Newcomer, the Catering Sales Manager, helped us with every detail of planning brunch for 23 people.  We decided to choose a first course of the \"chef's table,\" which included plates of fresh fruit, a wide variety of pastries, clotted cream and granola and other serve-yourself goodies.  My boyfriend (the croissant connoisseur) gave high ratings to the croissants on offer.  It was possible to offer our guests a choice of three entrees, but we decided to go with one entree for simplicity's sake.  The eggs, sweet potatoes, and bacon were well-plated and tasty. We were able to notify in advance the kitchen that two of our guest are allergic to dairy, and their two special plates arrived with everyone else's plates without a hitch.  The two servers who were assigned to us were excellent.  My mother, the primary contact person, appreciated that Nicole called us the day before the event to see if we had any questions or additional requests and that she was so easy to contact via e-mail or cell phone when we were planning the event.

Here's a weird but super important detail to note: Provenance's chairs are awesome. Sleek metal frame and seriously comfy but still sleek grey cushioning. SO COMFY. SO MODERN.  Oh, art museum decor, you are doing it right.  

I know that I've only been here one, but Provenance merits five stars from me based on how wonderfully my family's event here turned out and based on how much I'd like to come here with my boyfriend for lunch or dinner the next time we return to the Cleve. How great it is that the museum has free admission and that their fancypants restaurant is fantastic and not too spendy!  Also, eating here has 100% solidified my conviction that the Cleveland Museum of Art is my dream location for my wedding and reception in the near-ish future."}
{"text":"I'm only going to speak for their macarons - THEY ARE AMAZING! seriously, they cost $1.75 (same price as luna bakery cafe) but the quality is better! They are fresher and the flavor is a little stronger. However, they only have two flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"The new building and atrium are neat, and there are some interesting food choices here, including some vegetarian (tasty but not great--they mix unusual things to be interesting, but the result isn't always memorable). Service was surly and very slow, and everything in the Cafe's grill area was handled manually (gloved), not with tongs/utensils (with the exception of some scooped side dishes). That means meat grease gets on every single thing: the bread, the lettuce in the salads, the french fries, etc. They pick up greasy burgers and skewers of meat by hand, and move right on to hand-grabbing someone else's salad or sandwich or fries. This wasn't one single employee--it's how everyone there operated. Sometimes they'd \"clean\" the gloves by wiping them on their clothing. I can only hope the raw meat is handled better? If you're a vegetarian without an iron stomach, stay away from the grill. (The salad-only area may be a better bet--I did not observe the practices there.)"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here pretty much every time I stop by the art museum and the food is great, actually excellent. I've been around to many museums and none of them have food like the Cleveland Art Museum.

I've had their pizza, grilled lamb on pita, salads and I can't think of anything bad to say. The one item that I didn't think looked great was their noodle salad! They also serve beer and wine if that is of interest to you.

Seating is usually packed in the cafe, but you can also sit outside in the atrium. Even if you are not going to the art museum this is a great place to stop by for lunch since admission is free.

Expect to pay $10+ by the time you get a drink... Members of the museum get a 10% discount."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! Came in for an early lunch with two other people who are very familiar with the museum and this restaurant. 

To start, I absolutely love the modern decor. It is both warm and edgy. The sun greets you from the wall of windows that the dining room focuses on. (They are currently working on completing a rooftop garden that will be visualized from the dining room). From the hostess to the waitress I was pleased with the smiles and professionalism. Our waitress was adorable and thorough. She gave us the appropriate amount of time, never rushed us, made sure we knew every option of drinks, entrees, and dessert. She was very knowledgable if we had any questions and honest to say \"I will check with the kitchen\" if she was not sure of the answer. 

Two of my party ordered the Curried Chicken Salad and I ordered the Ravioletti. They both loved the salad, a generous portion for lunch, and the Ravioletti was good. It is a smaller portion but the flavor is enjoyable with a lovely cheesy center and a wonderful garnished called popcorn shoots (I had never had these before but they really do resemble the taste of popcorn like the waitress discuss with us). However the brown butter on the dish became just a little too oily for me, but overall the dish was very unique and inventive. The house cocktail, The Provenance, is beautiful and VERY strong. You will get your moneys worth of liquor in this cocktail. There is a wine list and several other options of cocktails to choose from. We had two desserts split between the three of us. They were beautiful and artistic, exactly what you would hope for from a lovely restaurant in the art museum. 

We were never rushed even as the restaurant filled up and we were able to sit and enjoy the coffee, dessert, and conversation without ever filling pushed by staff. 

This is a great spot to take time out of an afternoon at the museum and enjoy each others company and discuss what art you have seen or will be seeing. Do this while enjoying creative dishes that will allow you to appreciate a different- but just as pleasing form of art- culinary."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch with my husband. 

Service is truly excellent! We had a great experience and wanted for nothing. 

Food. Well... The chefs table items that comes with every meal were delicious. The croissants, in particular, were fantastic. Beautiful fresh fruit.  Yummy scones. I think I had a little of everything and it was all very good. Coffee: perfect. BUT our meals were hit or miss. The potatoes with chicken sausage and eggs were great. The french toast was not ok. Very crispy. Dry. Kinda over caramelized on the bottom? Neither of us really liked it, but when the server asked us if there was something wrong with it we said no.  Honestly, there was nothing overtly wrong that the kitchen did to it- it's just the recipe. Anyway, I would skip it in the future.  We will definitely be returning though!"}
{"text":"The restaurant that you make a reservation for on Opentable is different from the Provenance Cafe, which is the first thing you see when you enter the art museum and turn right. The Cafe has some contained seating and seating in the atrium of the museum, whereas the main restaurant has all self-contained seating. The main restaurant is to the left of the cafe. I would like to try the cafe next time. It looked very cool - a modern, glorified cafeteria with several chef attended stations. 

I went for brunch which is 11-3. All entree orders entitle you to unlimited self-service access to the chef's table. It contained bakery, scones and jam, lots of fresh fruit, a light salad, etc. I loved the salad and scones. 

The brunch menu is amazing. If you're tired of brunch menus listing bacon and eggs this menu will not disappoint. There are only 8 options. I would consider most breakfast related instead of lunch. The crab quiche is a nice large portion with a good layer of lump crap. 

I think when taking into account portion size and access to the chef's table the prices are pretty cheap. Though drinks are pricy in my opinion. 

Street meter parking is free on weekend. Museum access is free. Walking around Wade Oval after brunch is also free and highly recommended."}
{"text":"The one positive things I can say is that the location is great and the restaurant is well decorated. Neither makes a restaurant worthwhile. There are better options in Cleveland.

Customer service at the reception was terrible. Late the night before our brunch, I changed our reservation from 2 to 3 people, which required a time change per Open Table, from the first available at 11AM to 11:15AM. As there are no two-person table in this restaurant, this change obviously meant that the 11AM time was not at the maximum number of guests they could handle. But when we arrived the next day, and they had just opened and only seated 1 table with 3 guests, we were told to come back in 8 minutes because it was 11:07AM and they were full. It was ludicrous as we were staring at an empty restaurant with no other party waiting to be seated. We were hoping for the food to make up for the poor start to the experience, but not a chance. One of us was pescatarian, and the choices were limited; there was meat - esp. pork - in many dishes. Cocktails and coffee were average. The quail and waffle was ok. The cornmeal pancake was dry and too salty. Disappointing meal all around. I would not come back, and definitely would not recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"As much as I love the CMA and Chef Katz, Provenance just falls flat for me. I certainly appreciate the availability of freshly prepared, thoughtful, and seasonal fare in a beautiful setting, but the experience of dining in the caf√© is a bit awkward and I have yet to be impressed with any meal I have had. Although the concept is a good one, the execution seems lacking. The process of sidling up to the stations to order, the inevitable crowding, and the fact that one must wait at the counter with one's tray - further exacerbating the crowding situation - all make the experience slightly odd and off-putting. I also feel like I've overspent for what I get: today a pretty-okay tofu sandwich and bottle of water ran me $15 and I left still feeling hungry.  In the future, I may return for a beverage or snack, but will likely make a point of having a meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Spent a quiet Sunday brunch with 5 family members and everything was perfect.  We had a table with a great view, excellent service, and very good food.

The brunch menu is a bit limited but we all liked what we ate including trout on greens topped with a fried egg... and smoked salmon on a corn pancake.

They offer a really interesting selection of mixed drinks... but we didn't try them."}
{"text":"Provenance Cafe is the more casual, self-serve eatery at the Cleveland Museum of Art (the adjacent Provenance is the more upscale sit-down establishment).  Having worked in museums of CMA's ilk, I know how hard it is to get the food service right, and this place does a very admirable job.  

If you're in a real rush, they have pre-made sandwiches, salads, yogurts, and drinks in a refrigerated case.  If you have a bit more time, I would recommend one of their soups, or a tandoor-heated sandwich.  I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of their chicken chili when I visited this week, so I opted for the \"melty turkey sandwich\" with artichokes, red pepper, and some sort of chipotle mayo.  The tandoor oven adds a comforting warm glow to the environment, and it beautifully crisps up the sandwiches and breads.  They prepare the sandwiches with a light touch, and I appreciated that mine wasn't overly gooped up with the mayo, etc.

A meal in the cafe affords you the time to sit and be dazzled by the soaring atrium that connects the older and newer parts of the museum.  Even on a gray day, it's bright and relatively warm in the space.  It's amazing that a museum like this still has free entry.  Aside from checking out the exhibitions, if I were in the area and had a spare hour, I would come to the cafe just to read and soak in the atrium."}
{"text":"Stopped at the bar for a cocktail during our visit to the Cleveland Museum of Art. I ordered a lime, thyme, ginger cocktail and my boyfriend had a manhattan.   Drinks were great!  The bartender was so nice. Told us all about the social event the first Friday of each month and even recommended a place for us to go to dinner later that night (Felice). We took his advice and had a wonderful time. Will definitely be back to visit both Providence and Felice!!"}
