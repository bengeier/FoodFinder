{"text":"Nice loose leaf tea selection, good French vibe, attentive staff, amazing and unique desserts... I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST cafe ever!!!! It has a beautiful ambiance and the service is beyond exceptional!!!! The pastries are absolutely delicious and the coffee definitely exceeds all other local coffee in the community. I would like to give special thanks to Mariama and Haley for their friendly and outstanding service!!!! They always welcome me with a smile and make the best coffee"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. Friendly service & clean environment. My sisters and I got the fruit puff, raspberry lemon tart, and honey lavender expresso. We were worried it was going to be too sweet but it wasn't! It had just the perfect hint of sweetness. We had an amazing experience & will be back. Also, the lavender honey expresso had to be one of the best coffee drinks I've ever had (& I drink a lot of coffee)."}
{"text":"Incredible! That is, if you have a love for crapes or coffee! So happy I found this place!!! It's in the Harris teeter parking lot off East blvd. Yum!!  Wonderful people here! So helpful and willing to cater to all dietary needs. They have a great variety!!  I originally had them with a flamming 5 stars, but changed that when I tasted the to go pastries.    Ordered... ·Ice coffee with a pump of Carmel and half & half- omg, it's refeshing, fresh, & delicious.  ·Mint Tea- loved it! It was made with fresh leaves & a fun dispenser   Crepes:      --You can watch them make it-- ·Sweet Bavarian Crepe- Incredible!  A decadent cream all house made, fresh cut up banana & strawberry.  ·Custom Savory Crepe- mozzarella & cheddar cheese, light spinach, & avocado. Really wonderful  2nd time ordering the Bavarian crepe       · Both were over cooked       · My friend had a Brush hair in her crepe =(  Pastries:   -I ordered these to go- Everything tasted so great before I had these.  What a shame! I might not be curious enough to taste any others. One taste and I was done with the three I tried! My friend thought they were only, ok.   ·Napoleon- Really not as flavorful as I would have liked, meh!  ·Earl Grey Pound Cake- grainy top almost had a burnt flavor, gross & washed out my mouth.  ·Berry delightful fruit puff- some berries on top were good, others looked wilted & had good Bavarian cream. The pastry was really dry and tasteless.   Originally... Thrilled about seeing the case of what looked like really amazing pastries. I made a list of all of the ones that caught my attention!! After 3 disappointing flavors, I am now sceptical about trying the rest of my list.   Next time I'd like to try  ·Bruche (French style)- ·Mini apple rose- ·Bravarian cream horn-"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, beautiful decor, and delicious food and drink. First time here, but we will be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried both the Turkey/Bacon crepe and the Strawberry Nutella, both delicious. Our absolute favorite was the HONEY LAVENDER LATTE, MUST MUST TRY!  Staff were all so sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious deserts and tea. We had the lavender honey latte, mini apple rose, white grape tea and chocolate raspberry cake. Will definitely be going back to try the rest of their menu. Comfortable seating, clean, quick service."}
{"text":"I don't have a single complaint about this place. Completely met my expectations and then some!  I was looking for a nice spot for us girls to go for brunch while we were in Charlotte on a bachelorette party and this was the perfect spot! They have so many coffee, espresso, and latte options. You cannot go wrong with the strawberry, banana, nutella crepe if you're looking for something sweet or the turkey, cheese, avocado crepe if you're looking for something savory. The establishment is clean. The service is impeccable. The food is to die for. Cannot go wrong! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So glad I picked Crema. I have been visiting a new coffee shops every Friday morning after my night shift. Mariana explained the expresso menu and she fixed me one and loved it. I also got a crepe that was made right in front of me. Delicious.  Everything from the decor, service , coffee is AWESOME. Can't wait to visit for $5 mimosas! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee place! I've got coffee and crape and spend half an hour on laptop. Great place to relax and take a little break in a busy day! Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate weekend brunch spot. High quality and large selection of coffees and loose leaf teas, European pastries and crepes (sweet and savory). Wine and beer on the horizon;) Don't walk, run to check it out before the crowds find out."}
{"text":"Cozy place with friendly service. The pastries were pretty but didn't taste great. I got a chai latte which was very yummy and a good price compared to other coffee shops!"}
{"text":"I looooove this place. It's just perfect! Great coffee and treats. Real cups and plates, too. This place is my favorite."}
{"text":"This was a great place to study, work, and read. It would also work for small meet ups. Loved it! There is wifi and outlets everywhere. Lots of seating. Great natural lighting. Easy parking. You can have brunch, lunch (crepes) and coffee breaks here. Agree on price $."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte in January and haven't been able to find anywhere that i really loved to be at while getting some work finished. That all changed this week when i went to Crema! The first time i went i ordered the Honeybun Latte and The Health Nut crepe, DELICIOUS! They have free WiFi and it was a great place to sit for a few hours while working. Everyone in there from the staff to the workers are so friendly. When they didn't have the drink i was looking for, Viola quickly recommended a similar drink and adjusted it to my dietary needs. Halfway through doing my work Hailey brought me over a glass of water without me even asking which was very thoughtful. I have already been back a second time and received the same amazing service. I have found my new favorite (and local) coffee shop!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to have Affogato in Charlotte! It tastes great. Enjoyed the chat time with my friends here. I think I have the same music taste with who chose the music in the cafe~ I like old songs! I want to see more options for desserts."}
{"text":"Comforting little spot sitting amidst a large shopping center. So lots of places to park for sure. A few tables out front, but fairly close to the parking lot so not very peaceful or scenic. Good amount of seating inside. One large \"community\" table, bar at the window, one table style seating for two, and then large cushioned seating along the wall with hard chairs on the other side. Place is decorated with local artwork and mirrors.   Staff were very nice and accommodating. The cooler was down on this visit so they only had muffins, brownies, loaf slices, and danish available. All made in-house and priced fairly. I chose a vegan brownie. Very chocolaty and flavorful. They do have a small sandwich and crepe menu as well.   Coffee menu was abundant with all the usual coffee house choices. Their roaster is Black Powder out of Mooresville. I chose an Americano and it was very good and served in a ceramic mug. You can also choose from a good tea selection and they do have a few custom made smoothies. Prices were very fair.    Two gender specific one at a time style bathrooms. Very spacious and clean.   I will return!"}
{"text":"Very excited to finally visit this place. The onwer seemed genuinely nice and passionate. Very cute and cozy place, warm decore and atmosphere. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wandered into Crema while running errands. I like to try whatever food or beverage might be unique to a company. The girl waiting on me recommended a honey lavender espresso drink.   It was warm and smooth with none of the of the sugary aftertaste that can linger in your mouth. A bit of milk (you can also choose from diff milk substitutes). Subtle aroma of lavender -very sophisticated. Just the right amount of caffeine pick me.  Didn't get to try the huge dessert selection or hang out that long on this trip, so I gave Crema 4 stars. I'll be back in to try everything."}
{"text":"Crema Espresso is so cute! We randomly stumbled upon this wine and dessert bar and it was so good. The owner was so sweet and informed us of all the great events they throw! If you live in the neighborhood or are just visiting this is a great spot for some wine and cheese or even some homemade dessert!"}
{"text":"Lovely cafe next to Harris Teeter! I came in with my mom and ordered 2 different crepes, 2 coffees, and 2 pastries. We loved the personalized service, the cashier made an effort to see what kind of drinks we would like and made some recommendations. The crepes came out so fast and were a huge portion and just delicious. As we were finishing up, they brought out our pastries and coffee. It's not really a full service place, more like you order at the counter and they bring it out to you once it's ready. I like how they still went the extra step and provided table service by bringing out out items in order, I suppose because it wasn't too busy. Come here and support local business! Get one of the crepes with chicken and the lavender latte!"}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast and found it flavorful and satisfying. Very well conceived crepe dishes with good ingredients, plus great coffee and tea (my wife got tea in a special steeping cup). The menu has a tasty Eastern European slant, which I welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Every aspect is a pleasure! From cozy seating to delicious coffee and crepes..Crema has it all! Friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere will greet you as soon as you walk it!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! I had a crepe and it was so good. They made it fr sh while I was waiting which was awesome. The owner was so friendly and out going and very hands on. I would totally recommend the food here but even if it wasn't very good the owners personality would have made up for it. A++++ establishment."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is good. The honey bun espresso drink was AMAZING. I love when the drinks sweetness isn't overbearing...I hate feeling like I'm drinking a dessert. This drink was absolutely perfect with an extra shot of espresso.   I also tried the chocolate eclair and the apple turnover. Both pastries were divine...baked perfectly. The turnover had the most buttery, flakey delicious crust. The real star though was definitely the eclair. I am a HUGE fan of this place. I'll definitely return in the future. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I have never been so pleased with a cafe. Delicately crafted drinks made to cater each customers expectations on top of the most exquisite crepes and unique European desserts/pastries. The ambiance is fabulous so if you don't have time to stick around your first visit- I guarantee you will the next! All the girls there are always helpful as well and make sure each experience is more memorable than the last. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"You guys, this place is great.   I was meeting my BIL for dinner and arrived a bit early. To my delight, Crema was nearby so I could grab an iced tea.   First, know that they close kind of early (6-6:30pm) right now but they're planning to extend that.   Second - know that they they have beer and quite a nice wine list. Glasses of tasty wine are 1/2 off on Fridays yo!! Pair it with some nice cheese and charcuterie plates for a pre dinner nosh.   Third - know that they have a lovely bakery case full of things I want badly to eat but know I probably shouldn't. They explained pastries are \"Russian\" style and thus less sweet than you might be used to. Had I not had a dinner date, I would have torn it up!  Finally - the staff could not be nicer! My iced tea (mint) was made fresh and I felt truly welcomed.   Go here!"}
{"text":"Awesome ppl, awesome coffee...  decor is warm and cozy.  Crepe selections is pleasant.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious. You have to drink the Honey Lavender Latte! Paired with the Berry Puff pastry. Deeeevine."}
{"text":"We ordered two crepes, one \"hamster\" and one Greek. We couldn't find the egg. The latte was very weak. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Super cute, the employees were very nice and helpful and the coffee and crepe were so good! A really nice energy, tucked away in Dilworth. Many lavender lattes I've had in Charlotte are Lavender Vanilla, but theirs is a Honey Lavender--a refreshing twist."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out or meet up with friends! The service is friendly and helpful. Another bonus- they make the prettiest lattes!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed an outstanding brunch this morning with wife at Crema Expresso Bar and Cafe.  Two different breakfast crepes, a shared pistachio-raspberry eclair, honey-lavendar coffees and great service. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"What an amazing find!!! This place is awesome...I took my friend there for our first visit.  She had always said she did not like crepes.  She not only loved her crepe she ate the whole thing and can't wait to come back.  There is such a nice selection of pastries, I can't wait to try them all.   BTW...I had the bavarian cream crepe.  It was the perfect blend of ingredients...I will be a frequent visitor.  Also don't be fooled by the name they have a great selection of teas as well.  We were greated at the front door by whom I'm guessing is the owner/manager.  She gave us a full description of each pastry.  She was very friendly and helpful.  Give this place a try, I'm sure it will not be your last.   Let's put this place on Charlotte's most wanted list... : ) Looking forward to seeing you there..."}
