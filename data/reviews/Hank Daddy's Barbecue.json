{"text":"This place sucks. Went there for a late lunch. Ribs were cold and tasteless and cornbread the same."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place twice now and the second time around made me do this review. The staff is kind and friendly. Once we arrived a couple of the meats and sides we wanted were not ready yet, and we had to wait almost half an hour. The staff apologized over and over. To make up for it they gave us a free side, and extra meat. The customer service made me happy. The prices are decent. The wait time isn't the best but this isn't fast food so it's expected. Really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is better than any Ribfest I have ever had.  Will come back many more times.  The food is fabulous and staff is very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for championship BBQ, then Hank Daddy's is the place you have to go. I kept driving by this place because of work and finally fit it into my schedule to stop in for a meal ... And thank goodness I did. I will definitely be back over and over again.  The space is big and welcoming. The menu is on the big wall to the right of the entrance and you have lots of choices.  Step up to the counter, place your order and have a seat. We went on a Tuesday evening and quite a few guests were in the restaurant. The staff is great and they know their stuff. If you have a question about BBQ, they will will have the answer.   We ordered the platter for 2 and it was so worth it. If you go home hungry, then there is something seriously wrong with you.  The platter includes pulled pork, beef brisket, smoked chicken wings, ribs and your choice of 2 sides (we got mac 'n cheese and baked beans). We also added corn bread and smoked sausage. Everything on the platter is kissed with their original BBQ sauce except for the wings for which you get to choose your sauce.  All of their sauces have been developed by the owner, Hank, and he got it right. In addition to the sauces, Hank also developed his own dry rub ... mic drop!  All of their meats are smoked just right. He uses a combination of fruit woods for smoking and the flavour it imparts on the meat is absolutely delicious. You can see the bark on the meat and it keeps calling you back for another bite.  I love BBQ and have had the opportunity to try it all over the GTA   I can say with absolute confidence that Hank Daddy's BBQ rocked my BBQ WORLD!  I WILL ABSOLUTELY BE BACK AND I'M BRINGING EVERYONE I KNOW! AWESOME JOB!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful. We ordered the generously portioned 2 person platter for pickup for dinner today. I asked about the smoker and it's apparently in the food truck behind the restaurant. It's a nice location with lovely red painted tables, a clean environment, and friendly staff. The BBQ smell in the restaurant was nice. The napkins in which our forks were wrapped are a nice sturdy quality.  But my first bite into the chicken wing was - fatty. They have a decent smoky flavour but the cooking length/temp wasn't right with the fat not rendered in any way. Then I tried the ribs; same thing. They were smoky and close to tender but just not there. Disappointing. The platter also includes pulled pork and brisket, both alright with no specifically bad features but nothing flavour or texture-wise to get excited about. The fries were fine but the beans were nothing special. I gave this experience 2 stars rather then 3 because the yelp description is more accurate. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" which is for 2 stars is far more representative than the 3 star \"A-OK.\" It wasn't terrible, just meh and sadly doesn't motivate me to return. I ate one rib and didn't really want another. It was a night we were both in the mood for BBQ so thought we'd try this place for the first time but this didn't meet our anticipation or expectations.  Sad to provide a bad review, but food is a huge factor in my dining/ordering out experience and this just wasn't there. Advice? Improve the recipe and cooking technique."}
{"text":"Hank Daddy's food truck is amazing. Great BBQ and fast through the line-up. Spent the extra ti.e for a \"no bun\" request to look pretty."}
{"text":"We just ate at hank daddy's and we're so excited that a great bbq restaurant opened in Vaughan. The food and the atmosphere is true bbq.   The food is great, just like the southern bbq we have eaten in Tennessee and Georgia.The restaurant is large enough to accommodate many guests and they make you feel so welcomed.  The  owners went to each table to make sure all the guests were happy and enjoying the food. All the diners seemed to be enjoying their meals  Great food , i highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Blown away by the service!!! Received such a warm welcome by our hostess/server Olivia. She explained the menu well and made us feel at home! The food was warm and plenty, the meat was tender and well cooked. More than satisfied with the service and food here! Highly recommend visiting this gem :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to come here for a while and I'm so happy that we finally made it! The food was delicious!! We pretty much tried everything and were totally impressed. The pulled pork parfait was my favorite it was so great. Amazing chicken wings... Never had smoked wings before. The beef sandwich was so good... not a drop of fat. Sausage was so great dunked in their homemade barbecue sauce and the mac and cheese was yummy and cheesy! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Hank Daddy's BBQ is the first and only real BBQ place I've been and I loved everything about it.   The staff were as friendly as could be (Frank was there himself and talked to us for a little which was very nice), and knew the menu well. The inside had the aesthetics of a proper BBQ joint, great for pics.   On to the food! We had some brisket, ribs, Mac and cheese and another meat but I've forgotten now, but I remember it was delicious. Every item we ordered was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be back. The ribs especially were super tender and had a great Smokey flavour.   Will definitely be back to Franks sooner than later! 4.5/5"}
{"text":"What great BBQ!!! I was excited to hear that this place opened and I have been here a few times since it has opened and they have changed the size of the sides!!   I tired the pulled pork, wings and ribs with various sides my favorite has to be the Mac and cheese. The pork melted in my mouth it was fresh and full of flavor, the ribs fell off the bone and with the BBQ sauce that I believe is home made have a great sweet flavor, the wings are smoked which is a great difference from most wing places. And I believe the honey mustard sauce is the best mustard I have ever had!!   Hank Daddy's has great BBQ in my opinion a must try for any BBQ lover! Here is a pic of the platter for 4"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. Nice atmosphere. Ordered the platter for 2. Had to take the rest home. Thought? the meat was really good, especially the wings. Not too salty and bbq sauce not too sweet. Mac n cheese was really good. Would come back!"}
{"text":"When walking in the place was so nicely laid out and furnished. Bright lighting, string lights from the ceiling, red picnic tables in the middle, a lot of wood accents. The layout was great. Next, customer service was so excellent. A man and a younger woman served us tonight and were extremely attentive and catered to every need. It was around closing time and they offered us complimentary corn bread and coffee! They were so so nice and that alone makes me want to return - thankfully though I can also return because the food was excellent.  I had 2 meats and 2 sides and found that got me generous portions for a very fair price. Extra BBQ sauces were available at every table and they all tasted great. Between my friends and I we had brisket, ribs, chicken, and sausage and we were very happy with the food. The sides were great.   We're not even from Vaughan but I would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich, dry and lacking flavour. Tired of being disappointed by GTA faux-BBQ joints."}
{"text":"Loved the 12 hour slow-cooked meats here. Mac and cheese side is also worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. I shared the BBQ platter for two and it was so much that we had enough leftovers for next day. The ribs, pulled pork and brisket were expertly cooked and they use good, quality meats. Mac and cheese, pickles and cornbread were great accompaniments. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Safe to say after reading some of the earlier reviews, that Hank Daddy's has overcome their initial new biz hurdles and is now in the \"killing it\" era of their business cycle with no end in sight.   BBQ has become latest trend to hit Vaughan and with spots like Hank Daddy's leading that charge I anticipate many copy cats will soon follow.   Having a meeting in Vaughan was cause enough for me to pay them a visit - even though my meeting was at Hwy 7 and 27 (HDs is at Keele, so couldn't be further away) but like a good 905oodie I didn't balk at a drive to get good eats.   HD's is located around the corner from National Sports at Keele and 7 and they've taken up an amazing corner location With lots of parking, great access from main roads and a huge indoor space. Walking in I felt like this spot was part restaurant, part backyard cookout. String lights hung from the ceiling with care above a mix of standard and picnic style tables.   The crowd at lunch was packed with business types in groups stealing away from their boring bagged lunches to come have a cheeky meaty splurge (and subsequent meat coma) at Daddy's place.   Being a first timer I took a long hard look at the wall sized menu... and got lost. I wanted all of the things. All of them! So I got to the front and asked for help... please. The gal at the cask was a rockstar, she walked me through it and as we went explained some easy combos and ways to get the most for the least. She also tempted me with their signature pulled pork sundae/parfait (pulled pork, mashed potatoes in a sundae glass). Amazing.   After some deliberation I settle on the pound of smoked wings (spicy) with a side of MacNchesse then for $9 added 3-4 pork ribs on the side AND used their Yelp check-in offer for a free side to grab some corn bread and really max out my order.   Ok I'll need a breather for a second here because I just got super excited reliving what I'm ABOUT TO tell you so gimme a sec........... ........ ok I'm ready!   To start let's warm up with the sides. Previous reviews stated insufficient portion sizes for the MacNcheese and that it was dry. Not the case any longer. The side was nearly a meal on its own a hearty sized bowl of super moist and cheesy noodles (see my picture for suspended cheese pull imagery haha). The corn bread was next and it was lovely, the perfect accompaniment to all the sauce on the ribs. It was nice and moist and not even a little try (read: no unnecessary crumbling!).   Next up, the back ribs, done in the Hand Daddy's original sauce. You wanna talk about fall off the bone? As I picked up each rib I needed to be careful as to not wiggle the bone too much as the meat was barely hanging on. I could have had no teeth and been totally fine gumming these to death. Melt. In. Your. Mouth. Yum. Not overly sauces either which was great so you still got some of the smiley meat flavour through the sauce (which had a hint of maple syrup surprisingly through all that BBQ smoked goodness).   I love the ribs, but the chicken wings? Totally knocked me back on my ass. Wow. Everything about these was executed beyond perfection. First off they were a great size easily the size of 3-4 of the baby wings you get at place like Wild Wing (seriously how are they still in business and growing). Next they were slow cooked, so not unlike the ribs they too were falling off their bones. And with that slow cooked smoked flavour paired with their dry rub season and their spicy sauce I think in the debate of who came first the chicken or the egg.... it was me. Get it? Yeah they were that good y'all.   I honestly had to stifle my audible \"mmmm's\" and soft groans between bites because I know I was getting hella awkward while eating.   It was an amazing meal, and for some reason HDs blends of spices and sauces go unbelievably well with a tall pint of Steamwhistle pilsner (available on tap here). The pilsner acted like a palate cleanser and really brought the meal to another level.   I'll definitely be back with my Yelp friends in tow. If you haven't been or have been thinking about going here, do it. Do it now. Line up if you have to. Once the word of Hank starts to spread anticipate line ups and wait times... but always amazing food.   Also say hi to Hank Daddy himself, he'll be the super friendly dude in the full brim hat cooking in the back and coming out personally to check out how your meal is going.   EATCREST out!"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and decided to try it with my Caribbean business partner.   We went in and right away I could smell the sweet smoke in the air.  The service was great and they were very helpful  ... we both ordered the competition ribs.  Wow . . The best ribs EVER!!!  Moist and the smoke flavour was not overpowering but out of this world   They use a Sweet wood that gives a flavour to die for   Great value and great amount of meat that falls off the bone and the sauces are so good and they give you the right to have as much as you want.  The owner was gracious and loves and takes great pride in his food.  You gotta go here ... its out of bounds with flavour  Can't wait to go back ..Oh by the way Batton Rouge ribs are like McDonald's next to these.  Cheers and enjoy"}
{"text":"Me and the fiancé were excited to try this new BBQ joint that opened in our area, but man were we let down.     The wings were dry lumps of wood and had no flavour whatsoever (we had naked and spicy) the ribs as fall of the bone as they were, were also dry but not too dry and actually weren't that bad if you happen to be in the mood for super super sweet sugar crusted ribs.     I wouldn't say they're  the best ribs in the area (that award in my opinion goes to another BBQ joint a short drive down Hwy 7) but these are good ribs.              I Still need to try their other menu items but I can't say I'm too excited anymore and don't know when I'll find myself back in there anytime soon.    The 2 star is for the ribs only and that would be the only item I would try from hank daddy's BBQ, and even then don't get too excited."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and selection! Ordered the brisket and the chicken both were very tender and tasted great with the sauces that they provide at the table. Would definitely recommend the mac and cheese and the corn bread as sides!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  A little overpriced.  Staff is friendly.  Food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Saw this locations multiple times on my drive to school and noticed it had a pretty good rating on Yelp so I decided to check it out. (You also get a free side for checking in with Yelp)  First off, the interior is huge and it is fairly nicely decorated and clean. The chalked on menu was a nice way to showcase what the restaurant had to offer. Service was very friendly and at one point the owner (or who I'm  assuming to be the owner) came over to show us the various sauces and to make sure everything was alright.   The food was delicious, we had gotten the 2 platter, 2 side (brisket and sausage) and a brisket sandwich. The meat was very tender and the sausage exploded with flavour. The only small complaint I had with the brisket was that it wasn't as warm as I had expected it to be. The sides were also very delicious, we got the mash potatoes, corn bread, baked beans, and Mac and Cheese. The mash potatoes and baked beans really killed it. The only thing I would improve is to add more cheese to the Mac and Cheese, it tasted a bit bland.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here at Hank Daddy's and will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"They say that the key to comedy is timing, but after visiting Hank Daddy's the other day, the same could be said for BBQ.  The place itself is very nice, with a great open layout. I thought their platter for 2 for $47 was great value, and nice that it offers so much variety (pulled pork, ribs, wings, brisket, choice of 2 sides and 2 pops). There's also a free side with Yelp check in which is nice too.  Believe me, I would love to give this place a better rating - and maybe it was just an off night, but I can only review based on my experience which was largely disappointing.  The cornbread was okay, and the mac and cheese was really good, but I didn't really like the coleslaw. However, we all know it's all about the meat when we're talking BBQ and it fell mostly flat.  The brisket was the best of the lot, which is important since it's most people's fave. I can't rave about it, but it was pretty good. However, a problem with it - and most of the meats, is that it was served barely warm. The wings were a little better in that regard, but the pulled pork and the ribs were not served nearly hot enough. They were also not fresh, with the ribs being very disappointing and tough. Not fall off the bone at all. The pulled pork even lacked taste surprisingly.   Though BBQ has to be prepared well in advance, there's clearly a threshold for time in long that can be and also ensuring how the meat is stored and reheated before being served. I sincerely hope my experience was a one-off, but it is a bit concerning that it was served this way on what is likely one of the busiest days periods of the week (Saturday night).  If I lived in the area I would like to give it another try since it's a nice spot and I think they are really wanting to make this work; but since I don't live nearby, I don't think I would make this a destination place to eat out at again."}
{"text":"I have been traveling through the USA and Ontario trying BBQ. This is the first Ontario restaurant closely resembling a USA rib joint. We were greeted right away from a friendly cashier who was not only helpful but knowledgably ++, My son and I tried almost everything, from the ribs, sausage, wing, chicken and brisket. I am a strong believer in having sauces on the side and they were able to do this for me +. The brisket is served pulled, personnel preference is sliced, not a big deal. The sauces are mustard based, vinegar based and a sweet BBQ +. Now I'm not sure but the corn bread looked store bought -, the sides where all good. Over all I gave a 3star, I do recommend this BBQ joint for a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Pros:  Wings Huge and delicious sides (The changed the portion size)  Sasusge  Service  Interior design is really pretty   Cons:  Depending on the time of day, they might not have everything"}
{"text":"My friend and I came on a weekday evening and we were the only customers at that time. It was around 6pm when we came and sadly, they were already out of ribs! This place is located on the plaza north of hwy7 and facing keele.   We ordered a Plate of 2 meats and 2 sides (beef brisket, pulled pork, fries and salad). We also ordered 1 lbs wings (honey mustard) that comes with side + an extra side if you check in on Yelp! (Sides: macncheese and cornbread).   What I enjoyed: Pulled pork (tender, flavourful and not dry), wings (was full of smoky goodness), crispy fries and their bbq sauce! Honey mustard was great too (tangy and sweet)  Everything else we ordered was ok (beef brisket and sides). Hickory was too sweet for my liking but others might enjoy it. A con I would like to mention was our food came out lukewarm, even on the colder side.   The total price was $32 for 2 people, it filled us up but probably because we ordered too much for 2 people! The portion size for each item was decent, might note it's on the smaller side.   The atmosphere gives off a summer night vibes with the lights and the picnic tables. There are lots of stuff on the menu you can pick from. I also love how their sauces are on the tables and you can dress it however you like. Overall, the bbq quality is great, friendly service and clean - I would come back to try their ribs!"}
{"text":"We had their pulled pork and beef for our company lunch and the food was amazing! I especially liked their barbecue sauce and their baked beans was also very delicious! Would definitely visit this place! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq food. Smokey favor and is a must visit if in the area. Love that's it's a family run business with friendly and accommodating staff. I've had everything on the menu and it's all good. The wings a really unique and hard to find other places to get them in the gta. Much better than many hipster places downtown for bbq. Prices are extremely reasonable.   Totally worth the drive to Vaughn for good bbq."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but portions are very small considering the price. Tried the pulled pork and brisket. Both came with a tiny cup of mac and cheese and the sandwich was on a small burger bun."}
{"text":"The space is cute and the selection is pretty good but I was disappointed in the food. Ordered a bunch of stuff - ribs, pulled pork, brisket, the original sausage, and a couple sides. Sausage was as good as can be expected but not great by any means. Brisket was kind of stringy. Everything except the sausage was too smoky and lacking in sauce (or much flavor beyond the smoke). I suppose you're supposed to use the sauces on the table, but do I really have to do that for every item? I've never had every item be this bland elsewhere.  The sides fared somewhat better. Mac and cheese was just this side of creamy and had sufficient cheese. Cornbread was really good, moist and a little sweet. Baked beans were too sweet and would have fared better with a smoky element to cut the sweetness (funny how that works out). Slaw was pretty good but not as fresh as a vinegar-based slaw should be IMO.  Service was friendly and the staff were really helpful in navigating the menu. Prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, the food just isn't good enough to return."}
{"text":"Good BBQ. Pulled pork was very good. Brisket was decent but I prefer sliced brisket whereas theirs is pulled. Slaw was underwhelming but Mac and cheese was rich and tasty. Service was phenomenal. Definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I just tried this place out with my dad and am shocked at the review! I was so excited to finally have a decent BBQ place open up in Maple/Woodbridge and was not at all disappointed after a friend recommended it.  The way it works is you order at the front and then they call you up when it's ready. The menu is written on the wall in the coolest chalk design. I was soooo torn over what to get.   I had the beef brisket sandwich and my dad ordered a rack of ribs. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the ribs but the sandwich is included.  I was stuffed and so pleased! The meat literally melts in your mouth - honest to god true Southern BBQ and this is coming from someone who loooves BBQ. The sauce was incredible too. The meat wasn't dry at all - drenched in sauce and the portion was quite fair. Most BBQ places that I frequent downtown have similar prices.   Then the service - the girl who served me was super helpful and friendly and even came by to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.   I can't wait to come back and try more! Such a shame others didn't feel the same experience."}
{"text":"This place rocks-- if your looking for the smacking smoky meat.  The staff are courteous and knowledgeable the meat is fresh and Smokey as it can get.  A tad bit over Smokey for me but I'm not a Smokey meat guys.  The portions rock you will not come out hangry"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp as it was a little out of the way for me and I was craving BBQ as I am from the states and I need my meat.  I have come here a few times to try different things. I have concluded to only come here for the ribs. The ribs are pretty fall off the bone and are very tasty. Ribs 5/5 Brisket 2/5 meh, its dry and pulled Wings 4/5 yummy coleslaw 3/5 meh cornbread 3/5  If you want brisket, Adamson BBQ. If you want ribs, Hank Daddy's does it better. Parking is alright. This place gets busy but line is smooth.  Service is great."}
{"text":"We tried the pork ribs and chicken bbq sandwich. The late afternoon Tuesday was dead but we gave it a try anyway. The sandwich was fine and the fries were yummy. The ribs were dry. I'm sure on a busy day things would be better."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE. Been all around America to many of the most revered BBQ joints in the Southern US and Hank Daddy's is the only BBQ restaurant that comes close that I've tried in Canada. And in the case of more than a few items, also is much better! WOW. We shared the platter for 2 and it was enough for 3 of us. The BEST smoked spicy wings we've ever had, the ribs were totally fall off the bone delicious and I absolutely loved the brisket, and the pulled pork was excellent. My friend who usually hates pork loved it!! We even had a sampling of some sausages and I am craving them just writing this review. I live an hour away from here and would drive there without hesitation if I wanted seriously good wings and BBQ. The service was friendly, helpful and very welcoming. Can't wait to try more of the menu! Thank god I often work nearby!"}
{"text":"Three stars were given to the decorations. I travel regularly to the southern States, and most of the BBQ joints are not as fancy as this one.  On the other hand, the meat is probably the worst BBQ I have ever had. After the first bit of the brisket, I can tell this is from a propane smoker. There is NO smoke flavor in any of the meat, and everything taste like the house BBQ sauce.  The ribs and the brisket are way too dry. I am glad to see the restaurant offers multiple sauce choices. But in my opinion,a BBQ joint should focus on the meat not the sauce."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!! Awesome food!! First off, the ribs!!! Soo worth with soo much meat on the bone like I've never seen before! The mac and cheese is also amazing! Would go back for that alone!"}
{"text":"Came here to try it out after all the other places in Vaughan and it's been the worst experience so far (except the one we had at Montana's). Ribs were tough and chewy, wings lacked the flavor and kick, mashed potatoes were bland. Not sure why people have given this place such a high rating. If you're in Vaughan and looking for good ribs and wings, go to Memphis BBQ."}
{"text":"Great bbq , I got the two meats and two sides , ribs and sausage infused with halopenos just fabulous , the ribs were were cooked to perfection and with your choice of there 4 difrence sauces on the side it was a very filling meal , the beans were great ,mashed potatoes were not bad at all...great friendly service ..I would recommend this place the food and quality was top notch a little on pricey side but if you don't mind paying a bit more for real authentic bbq then this is the place to eat at"}
{"text":"I think place just opened.  A group of coworkers and I came here for lunch to pick up take out.  We were super excited to try this out.  It was a bit disappointing from a portion size perspective.  The place does smell great!  My ribs don't don't super small but if you order the pulled pork or beef brisket it's pretty small.  You get an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes as a side.  Times are tough but this is a bit Stingy.  They thanked us for the constructive feedback.  The mac and cheese was dry and there were about 12 noodles in my cup.    It's a nice change and a new addition to the hood.  But it's pretty pricey for what you get.  I've never left a BBQ meal hungry before today."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat and get sloppy.  Picknic style benches, food served on metal trays.  Dig in, get sloppy, and bring your track pants.  The food is excellent.  The ribs are smoked and do not touch a grill.  Full of flavor.  Wings are A-ok.  Nothing special with the wings.  Brisket and pulled pork a bit on the heavy side.  All in all, its a fun place go dig in and get dirty."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ joint for the area. Its north of keele and highway 7. Kind of out of the way but worth it! When I went they had self serve biscuits and gravy and coffee. The biscuits taste just like popeyes but better. I got the beef brisket. It was so yummy. Also the mac and cheese was so good. Hank even came out to say hello. Im coming back for sure. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Herbivores beware! This is NOT a place you want to try!   I had a craving for some awesome bbq meat, and this place was right at the top of my list to try and did not disappoint.   My other half and I came here on Wednesday right after work around 6 and the place was pretty quiet but as we eat our meal it was bustling with take out orders. When you first enter the first thing that hit me was the variety of options. Their menu did take up nearly an entire wall after all. There was plenty of seating which is awesome to see. Bbq, and wings are inherently \"finger food\", and the worse thing is to be rubbing elbows with your friend while trying to put a rib in your mouth. There was plenty of space to spread out, and spread out I did as I eat (so filling!)  Right when we came in we were cheerfully greeted, and was briefly walked through he options of the menu. We ended up getting a platter for 2 as we wanted a good sampling of \"everything\", had 3 sides (mac and cheese, beans and corn bread) as well as an extra side of cheddar jalapeno smoked sausage.  We were informed that it would be a bit of a wait as the pulled pork and pulled beef brisket was going to be freshly prepared, as they don't like to keep those things \"pre made\" through out the day, which I can really appreciate.   The platter for two was just perfect. It came with pulled pork, pulled and sliced brisket, 1 lb of wings, half rack of ribs and two sides (mac and cheese and beans) and 2 drinks.   We also got an extra sausage, corn bread and also some plain white thick cut bread.  Let me tell you, my craving for meat was completely and utterly satisfied.   All the meat was tasty, moist and fall of the bone filled with smoky flavor. The side of carbs perfectly complemented the meat. On the table they also have some in house bbq sauces (hickory, original and honey mustard). Each was pretty much a perfect complement to all the meat.   What really earned this place a special spot in my books is the absolutely friendly unpretentious service. We were checked in on quite a few times, walked through different options, and the server was kind enough to also give us an extra piece of freshly baked corn bread hot out of the oven! At first the corn bread was a tad lacking in flavor, but the fresh hot one definitely hit the spot! So try and make sure you get your corn bread hot!  I could go on about this place, but will likely run out of space.   I'm going to just add on a final note that i would absolutely go back without hesitation.  Oh and they also have AYCE from Thurs to Sat from 5 onwards!  What other bbq place even has this??  This place has spoiled me and set the bar quite high for bbq places in the GTA."}
{"text":"I am really not sure how to rate this one. I will round up to four because I like the people working there.  Service 5/5. You can see they care a lot about their customers, checking in to see if you are enjoying your meal, even though the atmosphere is between a casual restaurant and fast food. Parking is plentiful.  Meats 4/5. The meats were good quality as you would expect. I really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and the sausage and brisket were enjoyed too. The servings are commensurate with the price.  Sides 2.5/5 the sides were really hit or miss. The fries are chunky and warm, not too crispy but I enjoyed some. Coleslaw was vinegar kind and was okay. Beans were canned and okay. Mashed potatoes would have appealed to some, but we did not find them appealing. Free pickles were crisp, dill and yummy.  If you want more food with better ambience, double the price and then some and go to Carbon Bar. If you want a casual, homey neighbourhood joint, then this fits the bill."}
{"text":"If you looking for some great food, awesome customer service and a great atmosphere look no further. Hank Daddy's Barbecue BBQ is a must!! Amazing food (quality and taste),  staff is warm and welcoming (including hank daddy himself, great guy) I'm a man who knows some good eats and great bbq, so head on up to hank daddy's bbq!!!"}
{"text":"BBQ hits Concord in a big way.  This place is great. The only issue I have here is parking. There isn't enough during lunch hour.   The Ribs are fall off the bone.  Wings are done perfectly with a dry rub.  The pulled beef and chicken are first class.   I would eat here almost every week if I wasn't worried about calories.  I can't come here for one dish. So it's a spread every time.   The service is very good. Both pit master and staff check on you to make sure you are enjoying the meal.  Price is Right. Lunch will run you $10-15.  And dinner $15-30   If you are a big eater they have all you can eat for $35 a head for anything on the menu.   I can't say enough good things about this place.   If you have an urge for bbq meat this is the place.   The only thing they don't have is a fish or vegetarian option. So be warned.   I look forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"Finally tried this bbq place. Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and 3 meat, 2 side platter for a party of 4. Love the brisket very tender and lots of flavor. My don enjoyed mac n cheese side  Ambience very relaxing and servers are very friendly. Place not very pricey. Lots of choices and will try ribs and wings next time"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have a very big difference of opinion on what makes good BBQ....well let me tell you a story about Hank Daddy's BBQ.  You walk in and the place looks like an upscale DIY picnic area, the menu is short, sweet and to the point. The staff is kind and truly represents that \"Southern Hospitality\". The cool dude with the cowboy hat, who we're going to call \"Hank\" checked in on us twice and made sure we were enjoying ourselves! Thanks Hank!  We odered the platter for 2 that can probably feed a small hungry army. The food was really good, wings were amazing and not even fried! The Ribs fall off the bone and mac and cheese was not overly cheesy! The slaw was pretty good as well. We were so full we asked for takeout containers. Hank hooked us up, with extra biscuits, some slaw and Mac and cheese! He even took our tray and packed the left overs. It honestly felt like having dinner with my southern uncle. Thanks Uncle Hank, see ya next time!"}
{"text":"Great food, I got the chicken and beef with fries and mash. The staff were incredibly friendly to us and offered us free pie at the end of our dinner since the chicken took a little longer than they thought. Definitely recommend this place, reasonably priced for two people even without the platter for 2."}
{"text":"Check-in on yelp to unlock a 1 free app!! Bookmarked this place cause it's in the area! We got the platter for two for $45. Comes with:  6oz pulled pork 6oz beef brisket which is so nice and smokeyy Pound of wings (i got the spicy bbq wings) Half rack ribs which is fall off the bone yummm 2 Sides (fries, corn bread and cheesy mac&cheese) 2 Soft drinks   Worth trying if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Browsing through yelp for something close by. This place turned up and it definitely sparked an interest. We have driven by this intersection so many times and yet we never noticed it. It is located in the North East corner of Highway 7 and Keele Street. There is tons of parking spots, which is always a plus.  You walk in and you see a beautiful menu on the wall, then you walk up to the counter and place your order. Take a seat at a table or picnic bench and they will call your name once your order is ready. Olivia took our order and she was so personable which made our first visit really nice.   We order the platter for 2 6oz pulled pork 6oz beef brisket 1/2 pound of wings 1/2 rack of ribs 2 sides - Mac&Cheese and Mashed Potato and two drinks.  HOWEVER me being me wanted to try more things so we added: Jalapeno chedder sausage and corn bread  Everything was DELICIOUS.   Ribs - fell off of the bone so easily Wings - the size of the wings are big! Pulled Pork + Beef Brisket - very tender and savory Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage - has a nice kick and flavourful (this will be my go to) Mashed Potato - definitely not bland, kept coming back for more Mac and Cheese - ugh hi, LOVED IT Corn Bread - it was for the lack of a better moist (that is a word that I absolutely despise) However it didn't crumble and it was delicious  I appreciate the hospitality given to us by Olivia and we DEFINITELY will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We were told to bring a \"light\" lunch since we were going out to dinner a few hours later. We wanted to get something different. We looked up BBQ and drove across town to try out Hank Daddy's.  There were some diners already there and a few more came in while we were waiting for our order. It can be a challenge to decide what a \"light\" lunch might be when you're going to be feeding 8 adults and 3 toddlers. For once we decided to take a chance and run short of food rather than risk having too much.   We got:  Rack of Pork Ribs - 4 -Nice and tender.  1 lb of Chicken Wings Naked - 4 - Just what we expected.  1 lb of Chicken Wings w/ Hickory BBQ Sauce - 4 - yumm!  Cole Slaw - 4 - Nice Vinegar Slaw  Cornbread - unk - kids got to it before we did!  Mac N' Cheese - 4 - can't go wrong with this dish.  Pulled Pork Parfait - 5 - The highlight of our order. Don't tell anyone but we ate this in the car before we got back to the house.   As small as this order was, it was still too much food! It's a good thing we decided not to go with the suggested order of two Platters for 4. Had this been all we were having with no plans for dinner, the Platters would have been a great idea."}
{"text":"Hey y'all this place is the real deal! Great tasting Q! Had 3 meats brisket pulled pork and original sausage. Portions were good flavors were excellent. As a BBQ man myself from Florida I can't say enough about how good they do it here. Will return tomorrow to try the Competition Ribs. Interesting slaw recipe could be a little more tangy. Baked Beans need some more flavor and maybe some chunks off meat.  Stop in and y'all be hooked on Hanks!!  Went back today 5-10-17 and got the Full Rack of Competition Ribs beautiful rack meaty, nice crust and very flavorful tried the Mac n Cheese and Cornbread both were tasty. You will not go wrong if you stop by Hank Daddy's BBQ they do it right even if they are a long way from BBQ country!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here!  I wasn't sure what to expect when we tried this place, the reviews are mixed but I notice that the most recent ones are promising so we thought we'd give it a try since it's so close to home and I was in the mood for BBQ.   Having been our first time we here opted for the platter for two which comes with 6 ounces each of pulled pork and brisket, a pound of wings, half a rack of ribs and 2 sides. I also used the yelp check in to get one more side. We went with the macaroni and cheese, cornbread and coleslaw. This meal is $45+ tax and is definitely good for sharing. The portion could have easily fed 3 people, we have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.   Our favorites were the wings and pulled pork. The sauces and flavours are delicious. We found the ribs to be nice and lean with not much fat, we thought they were almost too lean and were hoping for a juicier bite to them however they were still good. We didn't find them to be fall off the bone as a lot of people noted but it could have just been our rack of ribs. The brisket was shredded like the pulled pork, I almost would have preferred slices of brisket as a texture difference from the pulled pork. The wings are really big and flavourful, probably our favourite part of the meal.   The sides were really good, everyone seems to be raving about the mac and cheese and they are right to do so, it's cheesy and delicious. The corn bread is also really good, sweet and not too dry or crumbly. The coleslaw was ok but didn't match up to the mac and cheese or cornbread, but we wanted to have a vegetable and it added a nice crunch to the meal. The sauces are delicious, we especially loved the barbecue sauce and the mustard sauce.   The restaurant has a really nice interior, definitely has a BBQ southern country feel to it. We took our food out but next time would like to dine in to enjoy the atmosphere. The location is in a very industrial area which doesn't seem ideal but there is lots of parking and it was fairly busy at around 5pm so it doesn't seem to affect business so much.  It seems that there are lots of regulars already even though the restaurant is fairly new. The service was good although the girl taking our order was noticeably uninterested/bored and seemed annoyed at us for asking some questions. While we waited, another lady came by to let us know our food was almost ready and thanked us for waiting, she was super nice and the owner or manager was walking around asking customers if they were enjoying their meals and he seemed friendly as well.   We did do a takeout order this time which was eaten a couple of hours after ordering so it had to be reheated, which may have affected the taste of the food, although it was still super delicious. I look forward to my next visit and will try dining in next time!"}

{"text":"It was an amazing experience. Found the place via yelp. The ribs where fall of the bone amazing. Must try the secret hot sauce to die for . Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Super random find but glad we came across this place. First of, the interior is great. Really gives off the backyard BBQ vibe with its bright red picnic tables and hanging string lights. We met hank daddy himself and we appreciated that he came to check up on our table.  When you walk in, on your right will be a huge chalkboard wall, and this is where the menu is. Beautifully written and so many choices. If you want water it's self serve at the front. Some items we got were:  - a half rack: tender and fall of the bones kind of ribs  - chicken wings: extremely juicy  - mac n cheese: soooo cheesy  - garden salad: fresh!  They offer platters for 2 or 4 which is perfect for groups. Plus if you check in with Yelp you get a free side! What we really found fascinating was the many sauces offered at the table!! You've got homemade original BBQ sauce, hickory BBQ, spicy and honey mustard. Yum."}
{"text":"Very Good!!! Just found out about this place from friends that had recently eaten here. From their description, I knew I had to try it out. Very nice ambiance, wide open feeling. Picnic tables and tables along the windows. Menu is written on wall near register. Extensive selection. I decided if I'm at a bbq place, then let's for the ribs. I ordered half a rack, St. Louis style with a side of mac & cheese.  Wasn't disappointed! ! Fall off the bone meat and done to perfection. The sauce was flavorful, but not overwhelming.  Mac and cheese was also good, nice portion and creamy/cheesy... All in all very good meal and will be back to try their other items."}
{"text":"came here for a friend's birthday because he wanted all you can eat bbq. they have this special over the weekends in the evening. it's about $40 plus taxes, which ends of being worth it because most meals are about $25 or so already. so if you're a big eater, do it up.  I am not, so i ordered a half rack of ribs and half pound of wings. my sides were mashed potatoes and mac n cheese.  i'll be honest. I've been to 2 bbq joints in the past week and i'd have to say it was not the better of the two. but i'm not going to say it's a bad spot either. Service was great, and Hank often came out to greet customers and really gives it that personal touch.  the ribs were a little dry for my liking. i had hickory sauce on my wings and that was great. mashed potatoes were good, but would've liked to add a bit of gravy or sour cream on it. the mac n cheese needs to be more cheesy."}
{"text":"Drove past and was pretty excited to try it out. Co-worker and I got take out for lunch. I got the beef brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese and cornbread. The sides pretty much suck. Mac and cheese was quite bland, pretty sure it was boiled pasta and a sprinkle of cheese without any salt or seasoning. The cornbread wasn't fresh at all. Both sides were also pretty cold. The good thing is that the pulled pork was super tasty, moist and tender. The BBQ sauce they use on the meats basically make it that much better. Co-worker got the beef brisket sandwich which he enjoyed and the fries he got as a side... well, like I said, sides suck here. I totally appreciate the thick paper towel/napkins provided though :)"}
{"text":"Never thought could find such a good bbq place at this intersection! Got platter for 2. Everything was great. Especially liked the ribs and smoked wings. Really glad we got the wings naked because the smoky flavour really came through. Staff were very friendly and the owner was really nice too. I just hope they were at a better location. I feel not enough people know about them!!!"}
{"text":"Did I eat at the same place as everyone from these 5 star reviews?!! I was so sad I missed the yelp elite event so I decided to drop by on my own time. My first mistake was coming on a Tuesday afternoon because I was the only customer there. The ribs tasted dry and tough, definitely left out for awhile or just over cooked. They were not fall off the bone at all. We ordered the naked wings so we could dress it with multiple sauces. My friend absolutely loved them, they have a crunchy taste. The sides....where do I start.. the mashed potatoes tasted like a baked potato mashed. No sour cream, salt, or butter. The Mac and cheese wasn't as cheesy as the photos in the other reviews. Fries are very startchy if you're into that. Overall I'm quite disappointed, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch after using yelp to find a nearby place to eat. This was a really cool looking place on the inside. Really rustic like your sitting outside having bbq'd food. I think the food tasted good but the portion of side was small in comparison to the price and my pulled pork was cold. But definitely not hating on the flavour! The people who own the place were very friendly so it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Had a catered BBQ for the office and everyone was very pleased with the taste, quality, and quantity of food. Frank the owner is very helpful and provided the perfect experience for us."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere.   They recently upgraded their portion sizes and did not increase the price making this place even better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very helpful staff. Delicious food and smells. The sauces were great and the meats I tried (pulled pork, pulled brisket, and chicken) were good. I expected slightly larger portions from a BBQ joint but they were still good enough. The sides were unimpressive other than the cornbread which was tasty! It was great to have the owner/chef come by and check up as well! Showed great friendliness and class! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq I have ever had. All the staff are friendly and the sauces are all home made.  I used them to cater an event for 85 people and everyone raved about the food!  Definitely my go to for bbq"}
{"text":"Went there for the lunch and ordered the chicken. Was not not impressed. Wings were horrible.  Lacks flavor... This place is over price."}
