{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and grille. Friendly service, decent food, overall great place. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Incredible wings! Great staff and family owned just makes it that much better! I can't wait to go back for lunch! I will tell my friends for sure!"}
{"text":"I know this is a new grill/bar but it is just not good... They don't have basics for a bar, service was not good and I waited about 15 minutes to even be approached by a server and they weren't even busy! Their deals aren't good and it is so small. I didn't even bother getting food and I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Service poor. They seemed to be more concerned about themselves, the latest gossip and what friends they had there. Waited 25 minutes for a second drink and no one came to ask us. Went to the rest room, they took away our empty glasses, when we came back no one every came to ask if we wanted another or if we wanted the check. Ended up going to the bar to pay the bill because the server never came back but had to steer around one of the employees young children (probably 4-6 range) who was walking around the place between the tables, in the kitchen, behind the bar, etc. Ended up going next door to the Bamboo Cafe where the service and food was amazing."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want to hear yourself think. TVs are on at full volume blasting out sports events. Waitress refused to turn volume down even a little bit. My husband said he didn't think anyone could screw up a BLT but they managed it"}
{"text":"First time at this place, we went in early Sunday to watch the football game and have breakfast. First items we wanted to order was the special they had on the menu, Mimosa's described as a bottle of Champagne with OJ for $15.00, after a long wait and a search for inventory, they only had one bottle of Champagne left and the table next to us just ordered it. 
OK, next a regular order (small bottle) with OJ, waiting for our waitress to find out if they had it and how much it was (was not on the menu) our waitress came back and informed us the manager got huffy and said she didn't have time to calculate the cost for this?? 
OK, next a Bloody Mary's described as in a \"Mug\" with bacon. The Bloody Mary came in a regular glass with a 3rd piece of bacon? 
What a let down, if it is on the menu, then have the stuff and treat you customer like you want them back. They should have given us a glass of OJ (we would have paid for it) after all the BS we experienced with our orders and waiting for info. 
Breakfast was ok, but not anything better than any other place.."}
{"text":"Weird- I posted a review and somehow it has disappeared. Don't recommend this place at all. Food is below average and  overpriced. Service slow even though the place was over staffed. Lots of drama going on out in the open with the servers. 
FAIL!"}
{"text":"Standard bar fare. Good service, decent tap selection.

They play the UFC fights and it wasn't too crowded.

I will come back"}
{"text":"This place is a much better bar than it is a restaurant.  We have been there several times and food is mediocre and high-priced for the area.   A hamburger for $13+ is absurd in a neighborhood restaurant/bar.  Nachos are almost twice the price as across the street at Mi Familia and not near as good as they don't even use real cheese but instead using some sort of liquid cheese.

However, the atmosphere is nice and fun with good music (sometimes live music).  They do have reasonably priced appetizers during their Happy Hour.  

So, plan on going for an appetizer and drinks but not for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and there seems to be often a family member around to visit with you. The food is good and the salads are awesome  During soccer season you can anyways find a game on. During the year the have many special events as well"}
{"text":"Hosted a party on the patio last Saturday. Roxanne and her staff were fantastic!  Thank you Times 3 for an awesome night."}
{"text":"We love this place.  One of the things we miss most about the Midwest is the local pub with locals!  Friendly people looking to unwind with a refreshment and food.  The Three Sisters (hence Times Three) are not only terrific to look at but friendly and they run a very efficient place.  The menu is traditional pub but with fun things added to make it untraditional.  We've ordered many items and have not been disappointed.  Often their extended family is on the premises and the place is lively and fun.  Highly recommend.  Great for families, sports fans, or just a couple (like us) looking for a smiling face and good food.  The kids from Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and a beer. Always got good friendly service. Those who have complained about the service may happened to be served by help that did not appreciate the customer like the three sister do. Hopefully, they can find and keep good help.

The food is better than typical bar food. I enjoy the all you can eat fish and chips on Wednesdays. Also tried the Tuesday $2 tacos which were better than expected for a bar. Looking forward to trying some of the other meals. Do have one complaint, the beer and most of the food is on the pricey side.

In nice weather, love the patio which has a nice setting away from the parking lot with hills behind. I don't smoke, but never been bothered by the occasional smoker on the patio.

Only been at the place on a weekend evening once. Too crowded and noisy for my personal taste, but typical of a sports bar and probably a lot of fun for those who like hanging out and cutting loose on the weekend.

If the prices were a little more reasonable, I would give this place 5 stars, stay longer and visit more frequently. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a neighborhood pub for a beer and some decent bar food."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for mediocre bar food. Super loud atmosphere also..."}
{"text":"I've stopped in several times for lunch and have always enjoyed whatever I've ordered, although nothing has been exceptional but the service.  Unfortunately they have acquired a regular customer that hangs at the bar drinking Fireball Shots with the most annoying laugh and manner.  I think if I entered the bar and saw he was there I would probably leave rather than endure his presence again.
Best of luck!"}
{"text":"ok-I did break down and have this place another shot.  These girls have really improved the place.  I think they kicked out the drunken riff-raff and cleaned it up a little.  Great place to watch the game and get a burger these days.  We'll continue to come back as long as the drinks stay away.  Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now after a hike at nearby West Wing Mountain.  The beer is ice cold and the lunch specials are great.  I have had the Tuesday Tacos and Wednesday all you can each fish and chips.  Food comes out hot and fresh and the server who is also one of the sisters is incredibly friendly.  I would come more frequently if I ivied in the area but will definitely come back whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar in an unlikely suburban shopping center. I was surprised it was as busy as it was after seeing the failure of it's Italian restaurant predecessor. 

We just ordered the appetizer Trio Sampler w/buffalo tenders, fried zucchini sticks and \"nachos.\" The first two were as expected, but the nachos were terrible. Skip them all together if you can! Crappy red-colored chips topped w/cheese whiz worse than the ballpark stadium. 

Times 3 redeemed itself because of the affordable drink prices and fun, unique live music on a Saturday night (how refreshing to see a talented, female musician playing in a sports bar on a weekend!). 

Sports scene looked social and lively, while still being family-friendly. As expected, lots of male 40-somethings watching the Cardinals without fuss (I didn't see any obnoxious patrons at all! YAY!). Our waitress was nice and friendly--no complaints there. I'd go back for a decent hangout in the neighborhood--especially because our options in this area are sparse."}
{"text":"The menus were dirty only one person working on a Saturday afternoon service was slow. 2 hamburgers $30 frozen patties one ordered medium came well done no ketchup bottles on the table are customers using too much ketchup?"}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the past month and it seems to always be busy. Very small place, seemed like everyone turns their head every time the door opens. Food is GREAT, huge portions for very reasonable prices. Would like to see more drink specials. Great music, Friendly girls, thank god we finally have a little neighbor hood bar close by."}
{"text":"First time here. Don't let the strip mall location keep you from stopping by. Lots of tvs to watch your favorite game. Nachos were excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood sports bar. Good atmosphere.  All 3 sisters are as sweet and friendly as they are beautiful.  Great staff good food for a sports bar.  Great drink prices. I think I have found my neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"Came because somebody had reviewed and said prices reasonable. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. Service was good but draft beers at $6 for 24 oz is a little steep for a neighborhood bar. When I found out at check the owner was nice to come by and  discount the beers to around $5 and gave me a $10 gift card. But I don't live near here and probably won't be back. Nice gesture but wished the beer was cheaper to begin with.  Appeciated the thought. Without the owners gesture this would have been 3 stars given atmosphere is just okay."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch a game or UFC fight. Cozy, relaxing ambiance...nice place to be able to have a conversation with friends. Great sliders!"}
{"text":"Clean setup! Nice patio, specials r nice and simple to find posted on the wall all thru the week. Green chile burger is super good!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned place. Prices are a bit steep for this style grille with pub fair- which will likely hurt them when the \"new factor\" dissipates."}
{"text":"Great local spot. Patio is great but it's a major bummer the city won't permit alcohol consumption outside. Solid menu and service-- the Frilot girls do a great job with this one!"}
{"text":"I liked it!  I thought our bartender was very friendly and even remembered our names.  I have no complaints...and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"A new bar hits the North West side! My wifey and I know two of these 3 sisters (3 sisters = Times 3) from their past lives at the Heights. 

We are so happy for them that they jumped on this opportunity to take it on their own.

I hear the wings are really good, but haven't eaten there yet. 

My wifey and I have been there 3 times (really) now and each time the place was full of fun, nice, folks and our service has been great (thanks Melissa!).

I've definitely been overindulging in their $7 for a shot and a beer special. Beer is a domestic tap and the shot is either Jager or Fire Ball. YIKES!

Keep up the good work! See you soon."}
{"text":"Terrible. All around terrible. Staff is extremely rude. I'd recommend going across the street and finding something else. Incredibly bad"}
{"text":"Like most reviews of this place, it doesn't really seam like a business but more like some friends wanted a place to hang out, so they opened this place. It's nothing spectacular but they did seem to have some decent daily specials and the service was fine. I might go back if nothing else was open in the area."}
{"text":"They do good barfood. Salads are great. Wings are pretty good but not the best. The beer is nice and cold and the Decour is great. The ladies that own it try really hard and do a nice job. They are also a lot of fun to be around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Pretty good food for so sports bar.   Great place to have a beer with friends, and even family friendly as well."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood bar... I stopped in on a Thursday night on my way to go grocery shopping.  The bar is very small and I would imagine crowded on weekends.  Other than the small space I'd highly recommend it.  I was alone, and the bartenders and \"regulars\" were all super friendly to me.  I felt right at home.  Also Thursday is ladies' night and you can't beat $3 Three Olives cocktails.  Very nice.  Lovely ladies.  I'll definitely be back with my husband to sample the menu."}
{"text":"Looking for neighborhood dining spot that is locally owned and happy we gave them a try.  Speedy service, good food & sport watching destination.  One wish would be a wine selection for those who don't enjoy beer.  We had the frilot burger and pizza: we'll be back!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Owned by 3 sisters 2 of them are great but one has no business with customers! I have been to this spot several times (even though the food is blah) it is local for me and they could have had a customer for life BUT one sister blew it for them all. She knows who she is. I went there with a girlfriend on a Friday night- We both ate and had a drink. When the second round of drinks came they were not like the first and nasty strong and missing a key ingredient. We both took a sip and were disgusted. Normally I would appreciate a stiff drink but it wasnt that kind of party and it tasted horrible. When the bill came, I gave my card to pay and asked the server (which was sweet by the way) to take the 2 undrinkable drinks off the bill ($12) she brought the evil sister out that said she would not but she would remake them. I told her I was good and needed to get home. I pretty much pleaded with her for a refund and she kept refusing. I take it a little more personal since I was a bartender and server for yeaaaaars. She wouldn't budge. She offered me a coupon to return at a later time and I said that I didn't want to return if she couldn't refund the $12 for the nasty drinks that we didn't drink. So she ripped up the coupon in my face! She told me to leave before she called the cops! WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! Never again will I be back! Over $12 now she gets a yelp from me and I will make sure none of my friends return. So sad...."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a weekday and found the prices extremely high for a neighborhood bar! $10 for wings ($1 a piece)  not warranted. Appetizers and sandwiches were also priced high with little to find for under $9...fortunately their daily specials are all that is reasonable besides the occasional specials on domestic drafts."}
{"text":"I met  Roxanne, Nocole and Anna couple of days before they opened Times3, and I have to say what a breath of fresh air to have three not only beautiful but wonderful ladies owning and running a sport bar that is fun, welcoming, great food, no nonsence no attidue issues (The girls just wanna have fun ) and an awesome atmosphere. I always look forward to going there. The whole family makes me feel right at home every time! When your having a bad day Times3 is the way. YOU ROCK TIMES 3!"}
{"text":"Update your website so people can actually open up and see the menu for take out orders.  Unfortunately, a picture of the menu does no good and you've missed out on a take out order, and potentially more in the future."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for food and drinks. They have a better than average beer list than the typical sports bar. The food is usually good. I like the pizzas and the French fries are good too. The main issue I have is the inconsistent service and sometimes the food is below par. On my last visit, I complained that the turkey club wrap didn't have enough meat in it. It was just a lot of lettuce. Instead of making me a new wrap, the server brought me a bowl of chopped turkey meat. This was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. Was I supposed to unwrap the tortilla and rebuild it myself? If I need to make the food, I will just stay at home. If I had ordered a cheeseburger and it came out with no cheese, would she have brought me a slice of cheese? I think its just a lack of experience with the young servers. If they can upgrade the staff a little, I could go 3-4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to have drinks since I haven't been able to try the food yet.But the friendly staff is always making sure your OK and pouring nice drinks. 
   Not many sports bars in our neighborhood but Times 3 Just made things a whole lot better!"}
{"text":"I have had poor service here before, but today was by far the worst experience. 

Our server, a skinny young lady with long brown hair, forgot most of the various orders we placed. I would ask where our order of wings were, she would giggle that she forgot to put it in. I asked when our next round of drinks were coming, she said she forgot. 

My friend ordered a small side salad that was supposed to be $3, she received a large salad and was charged $7. 

I ordered the house wine, which was listed under the happy hour menu. She asked what kind, I replied with Pinot Noir, which was supposed to be $3. She served me three glasses of this wine and only when the bill came did I find out this specific wine wasn't on the happy hour menu, and was $7 a glass. Something I kind of wish I would have been told but mistakes happen. 

I can understand being swamped and/or possibly being new, mistakes happen. However there were so many things wrong with the service, and she just laughed it off. 

Disappointed, and will not return. Customers beware."}
{"text":"Nice local pub atmosphere
When you just want to find that local place where you can take off your hat and receive prompt and friendly service.
Great service accompanied by well balanced drinks at a good price.Crowd was friendly, pleasantly mixed with local spirit, and the staff was at our service."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews, but the world needs to know this place has probably given me SARS! We ordered a pretty standard pizza with sausage. What came out was not sausage, but probably dog intestines. This food was a betrayal of my trust. My poor toilet will never look the same again!"}
{"text":"Great bar and atmosphere! The breakfast sandwich is da bomb! The staff are very friendly and the regulars are great especially when I'm there!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! Roxanne is a peach, so funny, welcoming, AND makes the best bloody mary in town(hint: it has crispy bacon in it)!!! Little local owed placed...3 sisters opened this bar together, and keep it clean and inviting... We will absolutely be back!!!! Kid friendly as well... Come you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to drop in for a beer after a long day at work. I meet a friend up here every now and then to catch up. Drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Wow,  talk about being surprised! !! Hungry, looking for easy to get to,  non chain place, decided to give this a try. Boy, am I ever glad! !! I ordered the Tuesday special of $2 taco, got 2 of them, wishing I had gotten 10!!! OMG, yummy carne asada,  BEST this side of Rockin Baja Lobster in San Diego! !! Flavored perfect, not stringy or chewy... totally rocked this entrée! !! Hubby got the frilot (philly cheese steak) made with the carne asada and Jack cheese... wow, that meat just made this hoagie. 

Owner, Roxanne  said they get all their chili and carne asada from Hatch, New Mexico.  They are from NM,  and wouldn't have it any other way. 

They will even make an entrée that is not on menu if you request and they have ingredients. .. such as a carne asada pizza!!

Very impressed and will be back, especially now I know where to get great carne asada. AND, the plus for hubby is they have Sierra Nevada, his fave beer!!!

Roxanne fixed us a mean Bloody Mary complete with spicy japaneos, olives and bacon -- bacon, bacon BACON, and lots of sea salt on that rim...perfection! !!"}
{"text":"Food not good. Service not good. Tv's are on to loud. Have been lookin for a good neighborhood bar will have to keep looking."}
{"text":"We stopped here to catch a Big Ten basketball game with family.  We weren't greeted and found a table on our own.  Our first greeting was a terrible smell of (we're not sure what ).  It was our last chance for this place.  Headed to Bambinos."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is as good as it gets. If I'm there just to be fed I'm left alone. If I'm in the mood to converse everyone makes you part of the crowd.  It is a bar so if you want to bring your 6 year old expect it to be a bar. I bring my adult daughters and their friends and they love it. 

The Owners make you feel like it is a home. Love it."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar, decent grub, friendly staff, very relaxed atmosphere. Good place to catch a game on the TV"}
{"text":"This is a great, family friendly, local sports bar and restaurant! It is made up of friends and good times."}
{"text":"If you love a local hang out spot this is the place! They have great good and the atmosphere is spot on. The staff is wonderful   And friendly. The bar is kind of small but don't let that be a factor for the amount of fun you will have. Wall to wall TV's make it a perfect spot for football fans!!! Come out and have fun at this amazing bar and grill!!"}
{"text":"The food has zero flavor. My mom ordered the turkey sandwich and had more bread than anything else. I got the fish n chips and oh boy it tasted like deep fried oil. The fries were okay. This place is good for happy hour $3 drinks from 3-7. I didn't order any drinks just water since it was lunch although there were plenty of people day drinking. I think if this sports bar learns to season there food it would be a hit place."}
{"text":"Decided to try this hole in the wall sports bar as its near my home. Nice little bar on the inside and a good amount of tvs were present. The menu is very basic and it seems expensive but I decided to try to get a basic burger. They charge for anything added to burger including ketchup and pickles which I thought was odd. Server was a really good younger gal. They had one bartender and this gal to serve the customers but they did a good job

The food was awful. The burger is one that you can get frozen from Costco or a place like that. Very basic and it was awful tasting but usually those burgers are. The fries were ok but nothing spectacular and the price paid for the food was overpriced

All in all it was good little place with good service but food is awful so I can't recommend this place as somewhere to go to"}
{"text":"Lunch on Wednesday - both had fish and chips (all you can order on Wed.)  Chips were tasty, as was the cole slaw.  Fish was good, nut a bit heavy on the breading and a little too long in the fryer.  Had two large Michelobs and one small.  With tax, the bill was $41.00.  Bit pricy for a neighborhood bar.  Friendly bartender/waitress/owner - Nicole.  But the price was too high to make this a regular stop or to drive out of our way."}
{"text":"By far my favorite local bars.  Owners are awesome & they make their customers feel welcome. The food is great.  You'll find me here enjoying sports on one of the many TVs with friends and family.  Sunday football is family friendly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Owners are the sweetest girls!!! The food is good. The bacon salad is yummy and huge! Patio allows you to bring your well trained dogs to have lunch with you."}
{"text":"This is a nice little kick back place to grab a drink. It is nice having a bar in the area to run over to and grab a drink, and even nicer to have a spot to go after work that is not to far from home. The drinks are always reasonably priced, and the bar tenders are always polite. They are also not to bad looking so tip them well.

The food is what you would expect for bar food, so go there for the drinks and if you need a filler get the food. If you don't need a filler just drink it up and have a good time. Every now and then you will get your standard 40+ guy in there that loves the gym and wants everyone to know it, but it is still a nice bar and grill that is worth checking out if you are in the area and thirsty.

Good work ladies!!!"}
{"text":"For all the guys and single guys who go to this place to look at the sisters...don't waste your time. Your better off going to a strip club and you'll probably spend less. The service is bad, things are over priced and the environment makes you feel un-welcomed. If I could give it less then one star I would."}
{"text":"Updated review after a couple more visits.  It could be five stars with some improvements, but it's still really good.  The food I've had is great.  I love the XXX wings, though the price of $10 for 8-10 wings is quite steep compared to any other place I've been to.

Service has always been good, fast, and cheerful.  The beer selection isn't exemplary but good, with a few non-generic beers on tap.  Same with the liquor selection, not large but all the basics and a few mid-level premiums are available.

I expect I'll hit this place up about once a month.

Note:  Cigar and cigarette smoking is allowed on the patio, whether you think that's good or bad is your decision."}
{"text":"I LOVE this neighborhood hang-out! The Owners are AWESOME, the Servers ROCK,  the crowd is always \"just right\", smoking Patio,  &, even though I'm hooked on the Quesidillas,  everything I've had has been good! 
AND, did I mention that they have UFC fights for NO COVER???"}
{"text":"Very nice local bar! Love having such a great place close to home! Each time I've been the service has been good. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices on drinks!"}
{"text":"Been in here a couple times over the past two weeks and have to say that's it for me.  We've had bad service from other restaurants and they redeemed themselves on subsequent visits but this place is consistently bad.  Whether they're empty or busy, the service is lousy.  For a bar, you'd think they'd want to keep making money by pouring drinks for customers.  Unfortunately they haven't figured that out.  Everyone at our table had empty drinks and had to flag down the server each time we needed something.  Food is above par for a bar which is what brought us back but it's not enough to keep us coming in."}
{"text":"Our go to for our favorite drinks and food. The staff is absolutely the best! The sisters put their personal touch on everything. By far our FAVORITE place to stop for a bite or entire dinner. Support local businesses and stop in."}
{"text":"HELLOOOOOO!!!! Where's the damn service?!?!?!? Does anybody work here???? Open bar free food I guess! HOW RUUUUDE!! Horrible service! I literally had to walk in the kitchen myself  and grab what I needed. When the food finally came it was not so bad. But hire some damn employees. Who actually care!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the service, we really like to support local business.  And the people are very nice ever time.   Please give it a chance if you are close by.   Great service, good food, and good times."}
{"text":"Patio was nice. Service was very quick. Quesadillas were good, daughter gave chicken fingers a 6/10 (she is a cranky teenager), wife gave wings 9/10. We will back but I hope they add a craft brew to the tap.

Came back for an ASU game. It was a great place to watch the game. Servers were great, game was on many screens, and it was a fun crowd to watch a game with."}
{"text":"Meet friends here from time to time. Service always good. I've visited with several different friends groups. Neighborhood bar if you live in the area."}
{"text":"The cosmos here are everything. Whoever serves the drinks back there has a strong arm. It's close to home so I can drink and walk home. Best deal ever!"}
{"text":"We have been going here at least twice a week for a few months now.  Food is good and service is usually pretty good.  After tonight, we won't be back!   Roxi came over and asked us to move because a band was going to be setting up.   That's fine we had no problem moving.  She said she would buy us a cocktail for the trouble.    She left after we moved.  We never received the drinks, and the band wasn't setting up .  Instead it seemed to be a \"family\" party coming in with 6 children age 9 and under with one of the other owners.  The kids took over the bar and patio running back and forth.   When we go out to a bar we don't plan on having kids running around and if you're going to make us move and offer a free drink it would be nice to follow through with that."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar, it seems to always be packed Friday and Saturday night which is nice.  I always have a blast here since it is usually not to difficult to get my friends to meet me here and have a few drinks.  I have not eaten food here but the atmosphere is great.  Its pretty good in size with a large outdoor patio.  The place is owned by 3 sisters which is how they got their name.  Prices seem fair for a neighborhood bar and I hope I eat something here but it appears that I like coming here for drinks instead..ha ha"}
{"text":"Roxanne one of the owners waited on us. She was very personable and the food was very good. It is going to become one of our spots to haunt."}
{"text":"This is my local neighborhood bar and Grill which is always a go to for me when I want to have a drink with a friend or somebody special but still keep it fun and semi intimate.

I can honestly say that I have not tried the food here. However,  I have seen other orders and they look like more than just your typical bar food. 
I typically come in for the drinks and drink specials that they offer.

I would say that I've been here approximately 5 to 6 times at least, and I can't say a negative thing regarding the staff, the location, or the patrons!

This is kind of a hidden gem for us in the Northwest Valley. If you're in the area I recommend stopping in for a drink and something to eat since this place is very friendly and reasonably priced. 

I'm not a smoker. However I must add that I love the outdoor patio because it gives you more space as well as the ability to have an intimate conversation without a bar noise."}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood bar, always friendly service and patrons, The food is good and the kitchen is clean so if your looking for a late dinner and drinks I'm sure you will enjoy Times 3."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Good food.  Great tv screens and friendly service.     Try the Philly Cheesesteak :)"}
{"text":"As previously stated, food is marginal at best! I specifically asked the server (who was one of the owners) if their burgers were frozen or pre made, she said no. It absolutely was a pre frozen burger, you can always tell, and cost 13.00 to boot.  So don't go for the food. The drink specials seem to be pretty good, and there are plenty of TV's for all the sports fans.  Service was fair, very friendly and food came out pretty fast, but you will wait for your check and sometimes your drink refills.  The two times we went there was only one person serving the whole place and making drinks, managing the bar etc."}
{"text":"Great people. Great food. Always love coming here. 
We bring our 7 year old daughter who loves it! 
Always run into a familiar face. 
Genuinely feels like the community \"Cheers\". 
See you there!"}
{"text":"Just like other reviewers, I also felt  that this place was small and dirty.  Bathroom wasn't clean.  It seemed like only regulars were getting good service, all the others were left with attitude and bad service.  Bunch of gym rats and meat heads are regulars here to look at the waitresses and flirt with them. I would advise against taking your family there.  Not a neighborhood family type of a place.  food was ok...too pricey for the service that they provide.  ."}
{"text":"Great food the servers were friendly the food came out very quick which I was glad to see that seeing as I don't have a lot of time for lunch I will definitely be back and would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Typical bar, average scenery and pretty small. They stop serving food at 12. One waitress was taking care of all so that made closing the tab take awhile. The music playing was more boy band type rather than God bar music so it was pretty boring. It's a shame because we wanted this to be the go to place since we live so close but the search continues."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and watch the UFC Fights, or just relax. The owner's run the bar and are great hosts."}
{"text":"This place is tiny.  A very cozy little place.  Service was decent, food was average.  They have a lot of big TVs to watch sports on.  Eh.  Pft."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Unless you are a regular, they ignore you.  Lots of better choices around a- don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Party of 3, all ordered burger type meals, 2 pitchers of beer... $100+... I about died!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Went here when they first opened. Happily sat on the smoking patio and had some shots with 8 friends we got to come hang with us.  Was lacking music, even low, on the patio. As expected after a few rounds of shots, in a bar, we got laughing... Security told us to quiet down so we don't disrupt the neighbors in the back. Huh?
Otherwise I had no complaints at the time..... But never returned. If I have some drinks and shots in  a bar, I hope to laugh loud. 
Maybe this policy has changed since and calls for a revisit ?"}
