{"text":"It was just fine. We sat at the bar so we had kind of limited space but at the same time I can't say anything bad about the service or food.  Since we didn't speak French well enough to understand the entire menu the waitress explained it to us for like 10 minutes which was highly appreciated. All in all very nice!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and like it a lot. The menu is not that long, but the focus is on seasonal ingredients (they do vegetables very well) and (for main courses) meat. There is a good wine list, with a lot of private imports. As for wine by the glass, on both occasions I was offered one that wasn't listed on the backboard. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for all celebrations.  We are guaranteed great service, beyond good food and terrific ambiance.  Dave the owner and head chef is a real character and great company if you  sit at the bar.  Excellent wine list.  Standout favourite dishes are: Nachos with foie gras, Caesar salad, the surf and turf.  I would pretty much try anything on the menu and not be disappointed.  Nothing is overdone, everything is cooked to perfection.  We have a hard time going anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life here. Outstanding service and the food was superb. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my father for dinner last night and it was incredible. We both agreed that it could easily have been one of the best meals we had in our whole life. I ordered flank steak and he ordered lamb. My steak came with scalloped potatoes that were absolute perfection. Even the salad that came with our meals was high quality and fresh with grilled vegetables. For dessert we split a slice of chocolate cake with cream cheese and Bailey's icing. It was incredible and fresh. I would go here again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone! Also, the waitresses were exceptionally nice and friendly (and they can speak English too) :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner! I wouldn't call this a steakhouse or Tex-Mex, more on the side of French with a twist. Freshly-made Cesar salad was exceptional. My party had the flank steak, grilled tuna, moules frites and onion soup and all were delighted. Bread and hot sauce are made on site and the fresh flavor is apparent. David, the owner, is a great host - we sat at the bar, which was entertaining and fun. The location at Beaubien and St. Laurent is great for street parking, I will make this my regular stop when in town."}
{"text":"Five stars in all departments.  The feeling I got entering, whilst there, and leaving was all just so welcoming and real. The chef is soooooo committed to his clientele and it shows at every second. He is so relaxed while he cooks that it would make anyone at ease. The staff is all quite similar too; friendly, welcoming, knowledgable and honest.  Gus is comfort food at its finest. The place itself is super cute. We sat at the bar and the whole dining experience was exactly that- an experience. I felt we went through adventures, both culinary and visual while there. Almost magical. I didn't want to leave. I wanted to move in.  The oysters were perfect. The squid and octopus salad was very good- especially the octopus part- I would have made it only with octopus if I had the choice... The Caesar salad had crispy pancetta chunks and bread fried in olive oil that all blended and melted in my mouth. The onglet de boeuf had layers of flavour and the portions were all huge (as opposed to many of these new \"tapas style\" restos opening these days). The scalloped potatoes on that dish were so so good I can't even come close to describing them. The lemon tart was fabulous.  Homemade baguette, homemade pickled pepper and homemade roasted corn relish all come on the side as delicious accompaniments.   Oh- the cocktails are fantastic too!  This restaurant totally has a Joe Beef vibe to it- meat, seafood, cozy, large portions, heart. If that's what you like in a culinary experience, go to Gus and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I cannot wait to go back and I sure hope it doesn't change."}
{"text":"Went to restaurant Gus last night through the recommendation of someone that we met at our hotel.  What a great find!  The food was outstanding, the service was warm and friendly, and the owner couldn't be more attentive. My husband hand the lamb chops and I had the veal chop.  The portions were very large and served with a side of grilled vegetables.  To top things off, we had a piece of the chocolate torte, which was to die for!   Everything is made in house, including the wonderful bread that has a nice thick crust that is brushed with rosemary oil and a perfectly chewy inside.  My husband and I are definitely fans and will be back again on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"David always has surprises every time I go to Gus. Definitely a must go place in Montreal wether you're from here or not!"}
{"text":"So we called up Gus restaurant, spoke to David Ferguson on a Friday afternoon to get a possible reservation for the same evening. Not a problem at the bar!  We arrive to be greeted by David, knowing him from Joli fou, we get our place at the bar right in front of David. We get a drink, take a look at the menu, friends had said it was more of a comfort food menu, decided on a gigot de agneau, and a confit de canard, a shrimp tempura to begin. The shrimp arrives tasteless, no flavour, no salt, no pepper, nothing, with a mango sauce dip, nothing to write home about! Then David calls the order to Josh for the main course, and Josh says last confit! Somehow a short while, 20 ,minutes later, David announces the confit was a mix up, somehow another table was served, he says it will be another 20 minutes? But remembering hearing that that was the last one, sounded strange, there would be another pulled out of the air or freezer? Possibly frozen, so it finally arrives, and is quite ordinary, the agneau does not measure up either, very chewy, but the over praised rapini vegetable of the day, is served saut√©ed for 30 seconds, raw, bitter, and no flavour! Not even a spec of salt? Leaving quite disappointed, wondering what had just transpired, walked home and felt an overwhelming feeling of illness, something with the canard was very off. Will confer with  friends to see if just maybe it was an off night for the place, or are we just better cooks ourselves?"}
{"text":"Ambiance sympa, style bouchon lyonnais.  Surf and turf absolument fabuleux (mais un peu cher). Je recommande cet endroit!"}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant recently. We called in at 5 pm, hoping to get a reservation around 9 pm for 2 people and we got it. We did ask to sit at a table, but in the end, we sat at the bar. For starters, I ordered an old-fashioned cocktail... it was okay, not the best I've had. For entrees, we had the sausage/pieuvre one with the nachos/foie gras one. The pieuvre was tender, but the portion was really small. As for the nachos/foie gras, it was delicious. My boyfriend, who is picky, couldn't stop eating it. For our main course, we ordered the pork chop and the lamb. The meat was grilled to perfection and I liked their mashed potatoes. It was definitely worth eating there. For desserts, we got the chocolate cake which is topped with like a barley cheesecake mixture and the apple poudding chomeur. The desserts were not as sweet, so it was perfect for my palette. It was definitely the best desserts I've ever ate.  The bill came out to be slightly expensive, but  it was worth the trip, since the waitresses were really attentive to us and the owner tried to talk to us as well to make us feel welcome.  I would definitely return :)"}
{"text":"In a party of 4. Two of us had poisson du jour, scallops (yea I know), which were grilled & served on bed of polenta. Excellent. Scallops done to perfection & polenta creamy with slight nutty (hazelnut?) flavour.  We also had red beets & grilled red peppers. both a pleasure to consume.  One minor complaint, the Green salad was tasty with very good dressing but the type of arugula was mostly stem making it a challenge to eat (coming from someone who is not a picky eater).  Our first time to Gus but I don't expect our last, & I'll certainly recommend to friends heading to Montreal."}
{"text":"My horse tartare did not taste like horse. Very disappointed. But. Ambiance was good. So 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and it was just OK nothing outstanding for the inflated prices.  Had the squid and octopus starter.  Quite good for what was there.  One piece of octopus and a handful of squid rings accompanied by lettuce.  Main course we  shared the steak for two.   Steak was charred outside and lacked salt for seasoning.  Potato was good but again vegetables lacked seasoning.  All in all a decent meal but for this price very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelping for an awesome restaurant is so easy that it is frustrating.  The choices and delicious pictures posted by many make decision making that much harder.  Its not a good feeling when you have already skipped lunch after a 5 hour drive.  But finally, we found Gus.  The gem is that is tucked away that is no longer a hidden to many.  We called and made reservation for 8pm and were advised that we will be seated by the bar.  No biggy... We actually love seeing chefs in action and its actually really nice to be able to sit beside your partner and chat more intimately.  Our waitress did not keep us waiting one bit and went through the menu thoroughly despite how busy she already was.  Everyone really needs to themselves a favour and try their margarita.  The BEST I have had and I'm not even a margarita fan.  When the our kindest waitress attended to other patrons, we were not left hanging.  Chef David swiftly took our orders and he was nothing but friendly from start to end.  Blah blah blah... I need to talk about the food!  We were served with thick fresh bread and house made corn relish (please see Kris' review of the bread, Kris tells no lies).  We then started with the fois gras nacho and grilled octopus.  Be warned, these can easily be your main if you're not a big eater.  The fois gras was unique, it really is a fois gras and not a p√¢t√©.  So that's what fois gras tastes like! It did not take me long to finish this appy and I already feel the food coma coming. The grilled octopus did not disappoint either.  It was refreshing and really opens up your appetite.    When the our lamb and steak arrived, we really weren't sure if we can finish the dishes.  The portion was generous but it is not the quantity but the quality that spoke volume about the two dishes.  The lamb was probably one of the best I have had.  It was perfectly cooked and served with a mountain of mint leaves coated in a sweet dressing.  Brilliant!  And if that doesn't fill you, there's roasted potatoes hidden underneath all the goodness.  Now let's talk steak.  We had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly with a sear on the outside.  They were juicy and tender; what made this dish even better was the sliced potatoes and sandwiched in between are mushrooms.  Wow!  It almost stole the steak's thunder on this dish!  Stick a fork in us cause we were done after cleaning up these plates!  We would've loved to finish up the meal with some dessert and coffee but we were quickly falling into a food coma.  After we got the bill and ready to roll out, Chef Dave held us back to send us away with a complimentary chocolate cake to go!  By the time we got back to our hotel, we made just enough room devour the perfectly balanced chocolate cream cheese cake.    Will definitely be back on our next visit to Montreal.  If you van only choose meal in Montreal, go to Gus.  This kitchen does not disappoint and the casual dining experience will set a new standard.  And remember to ask for bar seats!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here for my birthday. The food was good though because one of my friends was late, we didn't get our food for while (1hour).  Service was pleasant but spotty (they only seemed to refill half of the table's glasses at a time). It didnt bother me though because we were relaxing and enjoying ourselves. We ordered beef and lamb dishes which were amazing. My lamb was tender and no gameiness to it placed on some ravioli. The complementary homemade ketchups and sauces were great as well. The restaurant itself isn't too big so not ideal for groups bigger than 4 I'd say. I'd like to come again sometime if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was delicious, service was great and restaurant decor was lovely. We had the lobster salad, surf n turf and bread pudding. I can't say anything that hasn't been said before. You won't go wrong with this place. Just make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Gus.  The restaurant is small so an intimate setting which is great, we sat at the bar, and we had a blast with the chef and waiter, very nice people and great conversation.  As for the food, we shared the octopus as an entr√©e, it was perfectly cooked and tender, worthy of any spanish restaurant.  As a main I had the tartare which was very well seasoned, and the home fries divine.  Portions are generous so we were to full for desert.  I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Best fudgy chocolate cake with Baileys cream cheese frosting is beyond superb. Had it three times so far, two out of the three were just amazing. (Of course, their lamb shoulder too!) Anybody who undermines the value of Gus' chocolate cake is plain wrong.   If you don't like the service (because you didn't like the way the waitress handled customers at another table because people were waiting in line), sitting at the bar seems like a good idea."}
{"text":"Two years ago, before this place was well known, I visited and had what was the greatest Caesar salad I had ever had. I went back last night, and it was still just as good. I also had a beef brisket dish that was fall off the bone deelish. It came with \"au gratin\" potatoes, and a side of root veggies. It had a nice crowd and I was happy for the hard working owner, who always seems to be on site, cooking and managing. GO to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Delish cocktails, amazing seasonings and probably the best bavette I've ever had. All the while I was scarfing down this amazing meal I was able to watch the Habs on their bar-side television. The staff are so friendly and the chef went over the entire menu with me explaining every nuance and detail of his grub. Will definitely be back. It's also right next to Notre Dame des Quilles for a nightcap!"}
{"text":"The chef just wants you to be happy.   It's a friendly and casual looking place but a lot of thought and attention to detail goes into the menu.  Standouts: Foie gras tacos, Cesar salad, steaks.  I agree one should sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Le lieu est assez petit et cozy. J'adore c'est tellement bon! Les nachos au foie gras √† l'huile de truffe...le tartare de mangue et de saumon, les hu√Ætres et le petit verre de cava! Une soir√©e en amoureux tr√®s r√©ussie je dois dire! la prochaine fois on essaiera le Surf' n' Turf. C'est une tr√®s belle exp√©rience."}
{"text":"When you're weary from traveling you usually get extra hungry and don't event realize it. When you reach this level of hunger and fatigue the last thing I know I want to do is make food decisions. My thought is \"bring me a bit of everything and I'll figure it out\".   Now that's an expensive way of thinking but when your colleague is a neighborhood regular at a place like GUS, he or she will be able to order you the best of the menu and take the painful part out of making decisions.   Last night I was able to enjoy a shareable selection of several delicious plates prepared by the expert chefs at GUS.   To begin we nibbled on their complimentary thick sliced bread which paired perfectly (on the recommendation of the owner) with their house made corn relish. I actually could have eaten just that the rest of the night. Sweet and cool and a perfect way to soften the thick slightly sweet bread.   Our first and second menu items to arrive were a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The Caesar came as a massive portion more than enough for 3-4 of us to have more than a fair share. The dressing was freshly prepared and the croutons were huge holding their own against the dressing. The calamari was also very nice, served with some greens and done grilled as opposed to deep fried. It reminded me of Italian style antipasto calamari done in light oils and herbs.  Then came the fois gras nachos. Holy hell these were RICH. The cheese, the fois, the toppings. I didn't even really care if there were chips under all that deliciousness or not - there were, but who cares! Loved this dish.   I liked everything that was served to me until this point. The fatigue of the day and being a little tipsy on sparkling and flat white wines plus being a little full was all catching up to me. It was then I sort of entered into a dream like state and the main course was delivered.   Surf and turf!! OMG!!! Thank goodness we were sharing this because the portion of meat, mash potatoes and seafood was insane. The well marbled and nearly fork tender steak was perfectly grilled and marinated, sat atop a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes. But that wasn't all, on top of that steak was arranged easily half a dozen large tiger shrimp and a half dozen equally large scallops. This entire dish was coated in a garlic-butter (and perhaps mustard) sauce that had me eating far beyond the realm of \"need\" and straight into the land of greed.   I left fatter and happier as I imagine most patrons of GUS leave and slept better last night than I have in recent memory. Thanks to the staff for being amazing   Live from Montreal - Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Nous avons ador√© l'originalit√© du menu et leur cuisine savoureuse. Les portions sont g√©n√©reuses, l'ambiance est chaleureuse, la carte des vins sublime et ils prennent les r√©servations jusqu'√† 23h00. On adore cet endroit qui est si central dans ce nouveau p√¥le culinaire √® Montr√©al!"}
{"text":"Probably the best salmon tartar I've had in Montreal! All the dishes are delicious but the salmon tartar and the nachos au foie gras are a must!"}
{"text":"Had a really fantastic dinner here. The oysters were nice and fresh, our mains were out of this world (best caesar salad I've ever had), and the deserts were to die for! Definitely save room for the strawberry shortcake when you are there."}
{"text":"I have gone to Gus on multiple occasions, and each time the meal is flawless. It's a small restaurant, so expect close quarters, and service can be slow as there is a low number of staff for the complexity of the menu. Definitely plan for three courses for the full experience. Wonderfully cooked meats, and large enough portions for the price for mains. The margaritas are a MUST."}
{"text":"Jusqu'√† date, l'un des meilleurs restaurant o√π nous avons mang√© √† Montr√©al.  Nous y √©tions pour la Saint Valentin 2014 et avons d√©gust√© des bouch√©es de fois gras sur p√©toncles absolument exquises suivi d'un Surf'n'Turf m√©langeant c√¥te de boeuf et fruits de mer simplement d√©licieux. La viande √©tait incroyablement tendre avec une cuisson parfaite et tous les go√ªts √©taient parfaitement √©quilibr√©s.  Certes c'est assez cher mais je pense sinc√®rement que la qualit√© et le travail du d√©tail de chaque saveur en vaut le prix.  Allez-y sans h√©siter si vous voulez faire plaisir √† vos papilles!"}
{"text":"A nice little neighborhood restaurant that serves some interesting (generally Tex-Mex) twists on classic steak/seafood dishes in a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. If you can grab some seats at the bar, it's probably one of the best places in the city to watch a Habs game, as the food is miles better than all the other restaurants/bars I've been to that have a TV."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything we tasted was delicious and the service was excellent!  Warning: We sat close to the door on a cold night which meant we felt the wind rush in every time the door opened (despite the fact that there was a curtain)."}
{"text":"If I lived in this hip area of Montreal, there's no doubt I'd be a Gus regular. Even as a temporary visitor, I felt the good natured charm that encapsulates your whole being at this French brasserie.   We sat at the bar (aka, the best seats in the house) and were able to converse with Dave throughout our stay. Not only is he the Canadian doppelg√§nger to LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy, he's also a gentle giant with a nice dose of culinary creativity. That inventiveness extends to their cocktail program as well. Since I was there mostly as a barfly, the scale was tipped in the favor of Gus' libations.  From a guy who grew up minutes from the Mexican border, let me tell you Dave makes a mean margarita. He knives through limes right in front of your face and adds a few magic touches to elevate this already refreshing elixir into something special. The same goes for the rhubarb slush (procured from the next door ice cream parlor) which he adds rum to for a nice muggy weather respite. Calamari toast acted as a refreshing palate cleanser between meals to fully embrace the flavor profiles of both drinks. All the while yukking it up with the bar and kitchen staff who are so close, you could reach out and hug them. It elicits a kind of community feel that can only be accomplished when done just right. As you might suspect, Gus cracked the code.  Whether you're in Montreal, Poughkeepsie, or Tokyo, this is what a neighborhood restaurant should strive to be."}
{"text":"We tried for 3 days to come and eat at Le Gus, but It was always fully booked. Finally, we had the chance to have dinner here with my parents, and It was excellent.  The place is cosy, very little but not too crowded. The staff was really nice, I loved the fact that our waitress explained to us with so much details and clarity what was on the menu that night (as my mother is very complicated with new flavours).  We took an entree - tartare de salmon gravlax, huitres, Caesar salad. Mine was delicious, very spicy with the touch of wasabi. Then I ordered the bavette with a chipotle marinade, and what can I say : it was one of the best thing I ever ate. The dessert was very original and surprisingly good (dark chocolate cake with Bailey's cream).  All in all, it is quite expensive, but when you taste the quality....totally worth it !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply divine. From the salmon tartare to the roast beef to the tarte, everything was made with care.   It is one of those great places where the chef puts his heart into each dish. Everything was fresh and made with care. The ceasar salad was made fresh to order (even their pancetta is sliced to order), they home make so many of their sauces. It was my first time trying home made hot sauce and home made hot peppers sauce and both were super good.   As for the ambience, it is cute and cozy, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the chef prepare your food. The wine selection is unique as you can try many wines not found in quebec.   I came here with a friend and had a truly wonderful experience. These guys seem to love what they do, I can't wait to be back again."}
{"text":"Perfect. Amazing. The best Cesar salad (with caviar), the best duck, steak, dessert... Super cute space. The whole team does an excellent job."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and unfortunately last night was the last. I called ahead for a window reservation, after all it was a Tuesday night so I figured it would be available and I was told that it was. My date and I get there and we're given a seat in the middle of the restaurant and not even told why we weren't seated next to the window and as I was being sat down I noticed someone else sitting there. I was told he reserved the window two weeks ago which I think is likely untrue. Turns out the person was famous and being interviewed or something, camera and all so it comes without saying that a regular customer like me gets pushed aside. Either way, strike one. Next was the entree, the salmon tartar, which was way too salty. Usually it comes with some type of bread or cracker but it came with nothing, strike two. For dinner I had the last duck confit, and as I feared it was a meager piece and I even asked the waiter that if it was small that I'll have something else. Well, it was not only small but also dry and with a wine reduction that surrounded it like it was 1998m which in itself was thinker than m√©lasses, strike three. Needless to say, Gus was not playing his A game like he used to and it's the last time I'll go there. Staff is friendly and courteous but food is now so so. Came out with a bill of $125 i should have spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Montreal for years to enjoy the wonderful chefs and food scene in this great city, and Chef David might actually be our favorite chef of all. We've been enjoying his food since their first restaurant - Le Jolifou - and we continue to enjoy it immensely at Gus. His food is consistently thoughtful, fresh, and delicious. Simple sounding dishes that you've heard about for years - Cesar Salad, Surf & Turf - become something new and extraordinary here. In fact, it is far and away the best Cesar Salad I've ever eaten.  More than the food, the atmosphere and staff make the restaurant warm and welcoming. There's no better casual spot in Montreal to get warm, hang out, and treat yourself to some seriously good and under the radar cuisine."}
{"text":"Gus! The first thing I thought of, naturally, was the fat mouse in Cinderella. I knew things were going to go well after that.   We arrived to a beautiful and charming restaurant and were immediately seated. Our server switched flawlessly from French to English as they seem to do so well in this part of the world and as he listed the dishes, I knew we were in trouble. Give me all the things! Thankfully, Risa was able to pick some of the best items and order for us. Their salmon tartare was incredible. Perfectly fresh and gorgeous. We also enjoyed the octopus appetizer and though that's not typically my thing, it was savory, a little smoky and not at all chewy. And accompanying all of these are three hot salsas on the table. Apparently Dave makes them. His restaurant menu is littered with nods to the southwest (chipotle, serrano) and these three little delights were no exception.   At that point, I'd gotten into my second cocktail. Their margaritas, Dave assured me, were as good as any I'd get in Texas. I had my doubts but when that fierce concoction arrived, I had to raise the white flag. It was perfect. As good or better than any I had growing up near the border of Mexico. A good margarita in Montreal may be hard to find - but Dave's got it down.   Our mains were the pork and the (giant) steak with seafood. We may have over-ordered but by god, we we managed to eat every last bit of those delectable dishes. Then the dessert came. Seriously, trying to kill me. Thank goodness I had on leggings-as-pants or else things would have been dicey in the old button region. Our desserts were a dense chocolate cake with creamy frosting, some kind of de-constructed caramel-y apple dessert (tarte tartine?) and a lemon tart. I'm not even a dessert person and I was elbow deep, fighting for bites.   Restaurant Gus is adorable and perfect for friends, a date night or that evening when you just want a glass of wine and a good dessert. When you go here, high five Dave and the staff because they're awesome."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by another elite member Went out with one of my besties for dinner We simply loved!!! The chef is amazing, the stuff is great The food is more than delicious and they are super attentionated to details and your food allergies I'm not a super fun of pepper sauce, but their home made are to die for, they have 3 kinds but preferred is the middle one, sweet and hot... I got an oysters, 2 starters and 2 main dishes  We got the lamb shops and the duck confit  The lamb were super delicious and they have some great wines too that go well as an accord with your meal. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Deux fois dans ce restaurant, √† chaque fois j'ai commander des moules frites un classique mais √† chaque fois c'√©tait une recette diff√©rente suivant l'inspiration du chef ! Petit menu mais de qualit√© !"}
{"text":"Great Place! Food is well prepared and each dish has it's own special flavor. We were a party of 6 and everyone loved it! The fish drew raves and the lamb was delicious. If you like a great ambiance, personable, entertaining and knowledgeable staff and a chef that is forging his own path,,,, this is it."}
{"text":"Once you step into gus you are swept up in its warm milieu welcoming you in with open arms.  The hostess and waitresses are quick to make you feel at home ready to feast on their fabulous food.  The ceaser salad is what all others should be held up against and has reset my bar of salad excellence.  The addition of caviar far exceeded it's 5dollar price tag. In new York ci ty this would have cost $30 with the 2 Oz of caviar they heaped on top. The onion soup was another hit with an interesting twist of fresh avocados laden on the bottom to keep with the richness without making the dish too heavy.  I wish I had forgone the Foiegwa nachos cause it was def a miss. The foie wasn't seasoned and with the melted cheese and and fried chips there was no flavor added but just unflavored fattiness.  I wish I had ordered the surf and turf for 2 or the cote the boeuf or bavette the boeuf cause they all looked amazing. The last dish of foie nachos however took away my appetite and I was unable to order these dishes. So stay away from that and you will otherwise be supremely happy. Get the ceaser salad!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here. Rib steak for two with herb butter and mushroom onion sauce was excellent, cooked to medium rare spot on, lightly coated with Montreal steak spice. Tuna steak lightly seared just right went well with lentils and mint. I am withholding a star because even though the wine list was interesting and extensive, only three reds were available by the glass, and the pour was nowhere near generous."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Montreal. I ordered the Caesar salad which was probably one of the best Caesar salads i've ever had. Next time i most definitely will. I then had the bavette over scalloped creamed potatoes, i'd have it again. It was delicious. The service was great as well. The waitress knew the menu as if she had created it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo glad we came here for our last dinner in Montreal. We stayed at an AirBnB around the corner so Gus was very convenient. We started with the Caesar salad which was the best I've ever had in my life! Who adds bacon to Caesar salad?! Gus does, that's who! Unfortunately the onion soup was just OK. Definitely could have skipped that. Next were the main courses of lamb and duck. They were soo good. We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake which was a tad too sweet and an espresso and cappuccino which was good, but we've had better at nearby coffee shops. All in all, go to Gus! especially if you're in the area. This place is a no-brainer and the staff is awesome too. Oh the wine is great too and extensive."}
{"text":"This place is dope! Came here for a Yelp Elite gathering 4 years ago and totally loved my experience. However, I never came back.... until today! And you know what? It was JUST AS GOOD as I remembered it!!!  I'm stoked.  This place is real easy to miss on this busy street given the small size of the establishment. When you walk in you realize very quickly this place is  perfect for an anniversary or intimate date(s)! Our hostess and waitresses were amazing (and beautiful?) and we were really taken of during our entire stay!!! Loved it.  I went with Gus Margarita and Amaretto Sour for drinks and they were just perfect. They made great side companions as we dined happily.  As an appetizer I went with their Caesar salad and honestly it was simply the *clap* best *clap* Caesar *clap* salad *clap* I *clap* ever *clap* had  *clap*!!!!! The cherry on top of this plate is the fact the dressing is made in-house as the salad is BEING prepared once you order it. It does wonders for the dish!!! They also do it the \"traditional\" way with anchovies, croutons and capers. JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.  MMMMMmmmmm  This is about the closest you'll get me to become a vegetarian. In fact, if everything vegetarian tasted this good, I'd convert from my daily meat plan being a Carnivore and all.  As a main I went with their \"Duo a Porc\" which is basically 2 types of porc in a hearty dish. I dig it. Suggestion though, perhaps a little variety in the dish such as some greens or potatoes would go a long way? Still good but wouldn't have it again. I did try the wife's filet mignon and the meat simply meeeeeelted in my mouth.... divine.  For dessert we shared their strawberry shortcake and it was the real deal. Absolutely fantastic!!!!! We almost had a fight and broke out in shenanigans for the scraps.  This place is a total 5 stars and only their price-tag impedes me from visiting this place on a regular basis. This is why I need to win the lottery. However, if a special event ever does come up, I know EXACTLY where to go.  Merci."}
{"text":"Gus is that restaurant you came across on Yelp while on vacation that you haven't been able to stop talking about for a month.   We called for a reservation day of and they only had bar seats left. I asked if the chairs had backs and they did so we went for it considering how highly it was rated on Yelp, and we are so glad we did.   Our seats were at the far end of the bar, tucked into the corner almost and turned out to be perfect. We chatted with the owner, David, all night while he made each and every Caesar salad from scratch using only a fork (I think). Hands down, it was the best Caesar salad we've ever had.   Everything else we had was great too -- octopus appetizer, steak, veal chop, and dessert, also made by David. Margaritas were also excellent.   The vibe added to the experience. Everyone at the bar seemed to know David, and we did too pretty quickly. The place has a few tables along the wall which seemed more intimate, so there's a spot for everyone.   We will be back on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Nous sommes all√©s chez Gus ce soir, la nourriture √©tait excellente. Cependant il est arriv√© un p√©pin regrettable: la serveuse nous a apport√© une salade et nous nous sommes aper√ßus que dans la salade il y avait une c√¥te d'agneau d√©j√† mang√© dont il ne restait que l'os. Nous avons signal√© l'incident √† la serveuse qui a pris le bol de salade en question et nous est revenus quelques instants plus tard en disant que c'√©tait son erreur, qu'elle avait pris le mauvais bol. Cependant,  √† bien y penser il est clair  que le restaurant voulait vendre √† de nouveaux clients un bol de salade qui n'avait pas √©t√© mang√© par les clients pr√©c√©dents.  Le client pr√©c√©dent avait laiss√© dans le bol de salade une c√¥te  d√©j√† mang√© dont il ne reste que l'os √ßa  semble plausible. Malgr√© le fait que la nourriture notre repas fut excellente,  cet √©v√©nements regrettable doit √™tre signal√© car les restaurants qui essaient e passer de la nourriture non consomm√©e par d'autres clients doivent √™tre d√©nonc√©s car il s'agit d'une pratique tr√®s d√©plorable, d' un manque d'√©thique et de respect envers la client√®le, pratique inacceptable! Nous avons quand m√™me mang√© notre repas , toutefois nous avons encore un go√ªt amer dans la bouche et √† bien y penser le go√ªt de vomir. Nous aurions d√ª quitter le restaurant sur le champ au lieu de finir notre repas."}
{"text":"What a hilarious situation. My friend from Belgium won $100 gift card for Gus about 2 years ago and he's been traveling the world with it in case he made it back to Montreal. Last week we both ended up in Montreal at the same time and we're able to use the beat up voucher. The meal did not disappoint and the restaurant was charming along with the staff.   We ordered the surf and turf for two for $79 and that alone would have been enough food for us. The scallops were great. The shrimp was great. The meat was great. A little thick on the sauce for me but my friends loved it.  We also ordered the horse tartare which I wasn't crazy about and the Caesar salad with caviar on top. Now that was a delicious salad and there was such a large portion of caviar.  We didn't save room for dessert but somehow we ended up with a piece of blueberry cheesecake in front of us and it was one of the best pieces of Cheesecake I've ever had. Very light and a blueberries were a special variety from Canada.   Overall a fantastic dining experience. I recommend sitting at the bar and being part of the open kitchen. Thanks to all the staff at Gus for a great last night in Montreal!"}
{"text":"4 years later, still a favourite for a special night out. I love to bring all my friends and family here when they come into town because I know the service will be warm and super friendly and funny and comfortable, and everyone will love the food. You just always leave feeling happy and full and floating on good vibes. Everything else I said about what to order in my first review still stands, and I have loved all the various specials as well. Cosy, fun, joyful, delish."}
{"text":"Un endroit chaleureux, un staff impeccable et une qualit√© de nourriture hors du commun. J'y suis all√© le soir et j'ai profit√© aussi du menu du midi.   Le prix suit la qualit√© de ce restaurant.   Il faut absolument go√ªter √† la salade C√©sar. La meilleur √† ce jour!  Je vous encourage fortement √† y aller vous n'allez pas regretter.   Mais r√©servez!"}
{"text":"I have waited 2 years to go back to Gus. Long story short, during a Yelp Halloween party in Montreal, I won $100 gift certificate for this restaurant. Unfortunately, I had to leave the day after. So I kept the certificate in my travel bag, in case I ever ended up in Montreal for dinner. Work finally brought me here.  I and a friend decided to treat ourselves and go all out. We started with horse meat tartare which is really good and definitely a suggestion for people that have never tried horse.  To accompany the horse we ordered the Ceasar Salad, with caviar. OMG!!! Maybe the best salad in my life. Not only because of the caviar but everything was so fresh and tasty.   To make the whole experience complete, we went for a surf and turf. Which didn't come with lobster, but with a bunch of scallops and shrimp and an awesome thick creamy sauce.  I have to admit... I was happy we had to walk down on the way back because I felt like falling down at any point. So much good food... I thought I was going to explode.   The staff was amazing, friendly. The atmosphere, in general, is cozy. Like sitting in your own living room but you have David cooking you amazing food."}
{"text":"We are visiting Montreal and had a wonderful family dinner here tonight!  We would definitely return.  The food was fresh and seasonal, and the service was so friendly and accommodating to our family (which includes 3 kids).  The wine selection (we drank what the waitress suggested as pairings for our food) was delicious and our waitress was very helpful in navigating our need for gluten-free.  The homemade salsas/sauces on the table were divine (I suggest ordering fries to dip into all of the choices!).  What a lovely neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Whenever someone asks for a restaurant recommendation my reply is always Gus. No matter the occasion, Gus is my go-to reply! I personally love sitting at their bar and chatting with David, the chef. David and his staff are always friendly and make sure you're having a special night out in their cozy space. Totally recommend their Caesar salad (get it with lobster and caviar) and their margarita. Just writing this review is getting me excited for my next visit!"}
{"text":"The wine. THE WINE. The staff. The salmon tartar. The mussels. THE DESSERT. I can't actually remember what it was called but it has Jameson poured on top and I am speechless.   I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my meal at Restaurant Gus. Thanks to all of the staff who are amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a cozy little place.   We went there on a Monday night so it wasn't that busy.  We had the choice of sitting at the bar or table ; the opted for the bar where you can see the kitchen and the chefs cook.  We started with a pickeled calamari & octopus salad ($15): delicious! For the main course, me and my friend shared the surf and turd for 2 which included a nice piece of steak, shrimps and scallops and a side of butternut squash and beats...it was perfectly cooked and flavorful ($75)  We also decided to share a bottle of red wine which did compliment our meal perfectly...they have  a wide selection of private italian wine.  Our total bill came to about $100 each including tip...definitely a bit pricey but worth it. If you are looking for good food in a good atmosphere for a date,  this is definitely the place to go.   I will be back for sure to try the rest of the menu...they change it on a regular basis. ..hope they will have the horse tartar next time I come back!"}
{"text":"Vraiment convivial et chaleureux comme resto!  Le chef cuisine devant vous et sa femme fait le service. Tout le monde y est tr√®s sympathique! Et la nourriture bonne (comfort food).   Nous avons beaucoup aim√© √™tre assis au bar. On peut mieux observer le chef cuisinier et jaser avec lui.   Nous avons pris la salade c√©sar (un must ici), le nachos au foie gras, les calmars et les moules et frites. Tout est d√©licieux!  Bien aim√© notre exp√©rience!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! A few of my friends and I were almost in tears by the end of the meal from pure joy and had to compliment the chef. We came as a large group so we had platters of food instead of a la carte however what astounded me the most wasn't the amount of food we got but how well they were cooked. Every single meal was cooked to perfection including buttery salmon with truffle, perfect medium rare flank steak, amazing polenta and more! This is the first place I'm stopping at if I ever go back to Montreal.."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times. Super lovely staff. Everything I've had on the menu has been enjoyable. I typically get the Lamb, Caesar salad, Flank steak (Bavette de bouef) or nachos!"}
{"text":"I spent the weekend in Montreal to celebrate my birthday with a friend and we came to Gus for our last dinner in Montreal. We made reservations ahead of time and were able to amend to make them later given we were running late that evening. The restaurant is about a 10 minute walk from the Beaubien metro station. The staff was super nice about the accommodation. There is no menu but the choices are listed on the wall throughout the restaurant and our waitress knew the entire thing off the top of her head which was super impressive. We got separate appetizers (cesar salad with bacon, lentil soup and the calamari) and shared the entrees (mussels with spicy fries and the surf n' turf). The wine selection was extensive but overall filled with very good choices and the waitress was super helpful in helping us navigate through the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal and I will be coming back when I am in town. They also treated us to a shortcake on the house at the end that complimented the entire evening. Thanks again Gus!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite place in mtl to go! Surf &a turf is a must and their appetiser r delicious. Especially the squid & octopus if u r looking for a light starter. My favourite for the dessert is plum cake, but their blueberry cheesecake is very good too! Service is very good and chef is absolutely friendly :)"}
{"text":"Our first (and only) visit to Gus was on my birthday. We made a reservation 24 hours in advance to be sure that we'd have a decent table.  We walked in and were seated at a tiny table for 2 with an extra chair stuck on the side. Needless to say, the three of us weren't exactly comfortable in such a cramped space.  The waitress came over and took our drink order first and the drinks were delivered quite quickly. She came back a while later to go through the menu with us. We really appreciated that she explained each item in detail, although we would have liked to have actual menus in our hands rather than having to look at a chalk board at the other end of the restaurant.  We ordered 2 Caesar salads and one gravlax for appetizers. The kitchen was kind enough to make one Caesar without anchovies as our son has an allergy. The dressing was delicious on both salads and the gravlax was also very nice.  For our main dishes, we had one tartare de cheval, one bavette de boeuf and one pork chop. The tartare was served with frites, grilled bread and a side order of grilled vegetables. It was very good, but the tartare (albeit a huge portion) could have used some acid (maybe a little mustard). The bavette de boeuf was served with a gratin of potatoes and was quite tasty. The pork chop was served with mashed potatoes (lovely and smooth and well-seasoned) and a jus with tomatillos. The dish was really well-balanced but the pork chop was overcooked without even a hint of pink.  All in all, the meal was good but not a good as we had anticipated after reading reviews on Yelp. For almost $300 for three people (including drinks), we were left wanting.  The staff were friendly and efficient, so there was no complaint on that front. We live far too far away to visit on a regular basis, but to be honest we probably wouldn't go back in a hurry even if we lived closer. There are just too many other more desirable options in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! The service was great (and the servers were super nice), the portions were massive and the food was great. This was perfect! ! The only drawback is the limited amount of space--we almost didn't get in without a reservation."}
{"text":"Dans une pi√®ce rectangulaire peintur√©e d'un rouge vif, des tables s'alignent √† notre gauche. √Ä notre droite, surprise! Le chef est √† ses fourneaux, o√π se trouvent un bar avec chaises. Parfait pour discuter avec lui et l'observer pr√©parer ses merveilleux plats! En entr√©e, j'ai go√ªt√© √† un tartare de saumon avec caviar et avocat. Le m√©lange √©tait d√©licieux et frais.  En plat principal, j'ai eu le boeuf avec pur√©e de pommes de terres et pommes de terre douces gratin√©e de guimauves. Oui oui! Avec un petit vin de G√©orgie, c'√©tait √† tomber! Tr√®s original et tr√®s go√ªteux.  Je recommande ce resto pour un souper entre amis, et surtout leurs pur√©e de patates douces gratin√©es !"}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant with delicious well prepared food. I had a salmon roll which was wonderful. The caesar salad and surf n turf were also excellent but I wouldn't go out of my way for them. Don't get me wrong, I will definitely be going back to sample more of their food... I might be a little more adventurous next time :)  They are known for their margaritas but it was way too strong for me. Same for the tarte tatin, so much alcohol I had trouble tasting anything else.  Service was excellent and friendly!"}
{"text":"The very best little spot in Montr√©al - Gus and the entire staff are fantastic! Not to mention the food is always great! (I have been there a dozen times) - if I were you, I say you gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"Petite salle √† manger qui cr√©√© une ambiance chaleureuse, avec une cuisine ouverte. Service tr√®s chouette. Et les plats... Ralalala C'√©tait parfait de bout en bout !"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I was recently in Montreal for a friends bachelor party. Needed to find a place that would be good and would accommodate 12 people. Came across Gus and gave them a call and reserved a spot. The staff were really helpful and nice throughout the experience. We got charged $50 a person for platters of food. I was a little worried about the quantity of food since we had 12 very hungry guys in attendance. I was beyond surprised not only at the amount of food we got (we had leftovers) but also at the amazing quality! I can't overstate how great the food was all the way from the salad to the dessert. So much so that the groom was almost in tears (happy tears) and wanted the head chef to cater his wedding. All in all this was an amazing experience and if I'm ever in Montreal I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a few days last week to sample its food.  At suggestion of a server at another restaurant, I ate at GUS.  I'm so glad I did.  To start, I had the caesar salad.  Starting with the egg yolk, through the parmesan cheese, the salad is made at the bar by hand, the chef emulsifying the dressing with a fork.  Then, the salad was topped with slices of soppressatta and, as extra, poached lobster and caviar.  The flavor of the salad was wonderfully balanced among the sweetness of the lettuce and lobster, creaminess and richness of the dressing, and the saltiness/umami of the cheese, caviar and capers.  The star, though, was the spicy salami.  The  heat really shined and added such a unique element to the dish.  Next, I had the nachos with foie gras and sprinkled with avocados, tomatoes, and pickled jalapenos.  Best of all, the service by the staff was very friendly.  It's now my standard for Montreal's enthusiastic cuisine!"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for every single mood and I have brought pretty much every food snob that I know to here and they all all left fully converted...not to mention stuffed! Sitting at the bar chatting and watching David is a delight. Marshmallow sweet potatoes, ceasar salad and fish of the day have been my major highlights so far out of the 10+ times I have dined here. The menu is small but ever changing and every ingredient is fresh. Bonus points for an open kitchen, I love these.  They have lots of private import wines and beers to pick from which only adds to the cool factor of your meal, be sure to have a chat about what you like in a beer/wine and they will all make some recommendations that you won't regret. Of special note: the desserts here are fab, I personally am in love with the lemon tart nom nom  Also note: Thursday and Friday lunch is available and it is equally fantastic. The fish tacos and moules et frites: deeeelish!"}
{"text":"When I'm back in Montreal, you'll definitely find me at Gus. Risa D took us there after dinner for a night cap and dessert... if there was any space at the bar. Just our luck, a few folks were on their way out and we grabbed some highly coveted seats at the bar. It was pretty but with Risa in tow, Dave welcomed us with open arms... literally. We told Dave we'd love to try a dessert or two and maybe a drink. Our waitress was a self proclaimed old fashioned expert so we accepted her challenge with a round of those. Next thing we know, one of every dessert comes out and placed in front of us to share. Dave wasn't a fan of us sharing just one or two and insisted we eat them all. Each one was phenomenal, but one was a variation on a creme brulee and was life changing. We ended up sticking around and getting to know Dave a little better while he heavy-handedly made sure our wine glasses were never empty. A great guy running a great place. I only wish we would have had a chance to do dinner there as well."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious Cesar salads I've had, to date. Exquisite fois gras confit. Service was top notch to boot"}
