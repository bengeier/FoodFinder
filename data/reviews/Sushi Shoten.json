{"text":"Le meilleur sushi à Montréal! Je ne suis jamais déçue, toujours frais, prix extra et proprio très sympathique, j'adore!!!"}
{"text":"My second favourite sushi place. The owners are super nice and they also add a little bonus when we order a lot. It's very close to my house and you can call to have your order prepared for pickup. Otherwise you can go in store and they make the sushi in front of you with great care. They have the best avocado, salmon, and cream cheese sushi of all the places I've been to."}
{"text":"Great sushi - Reasonable price - Friendly staff. What else could I ask for? I definitely would come back again. Try this place and you would never regret!"}
{"text":"Convenient place to get sushi on Parc. They have a wide selection and the sushi is always good! It's a quiet restaurant as well so if you eat there you won't be bothered by a loud environment or anything either"}
