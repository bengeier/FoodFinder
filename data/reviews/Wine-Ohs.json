{"text":"I've yet to eat upstairs so this is a review of the basement only. 

This place is pretty sweet, I sure miss beatniq but they've done a good job keeping good, although different, music programming. The venue is nice, as are the staff, they greet you when you walk in and seem cheery. They are however a bit slow and will often only visit you once. I've had a handful of instances where it seemed like if I wanted another drink I would have to get it from the bar. Ill keep going though, the music programming is worth it. There's lots of talent walking on that stage."}
{"text":"I went here last night to watch a show and I got there a little early. I asked if I could buy tickets and the server had said unfortunately no, but he would take my name and ensure that I got a seat once the show starts. Once I arrived later on I went downstairs to the cellar, where there was a bar and more seating. The bartenders were also personable and you could tell they were very comfortable in their position- constantly joking around with each other while making sure you had good service. I enjoy when staff don't take their job too seriously- those type of environments are my favourite. The timing of the show was also perfect. Started at 9:15 and ended around 11:30. I prefer this over venues that don't start shows until much later. I definitely would love to go back here, mainly for the staff, but the venue in general was great. There was also this Kale Salad that I tried that was phenominal that I wouldn't mind having again ;)"}
{"text":"Met friends here on the night the Hired Guns etc were playing. Was almost put off by the cover but the music was amazing and got a CD so well worth it! Service however was THE WORST. Not only did our waitress have major attitude (sorry we're ordering drinks and food?) but she forgot our orders and it took 15 min from time of ordering MINIMUM to get a drink (and that would be one of the drinks of the round that was ordered not all of them). 
The manager was amazing at dealing with our frustration and lack of service and the atmosphere and music was fantastic so I will be back but I will never sit in that server's area again!"}
{"text":"We attended the breakout music festival and enjoyed some great music and atmosphere in the basement cellar.   

It was very busy and we managed to find the last table on this place tucked in the corner which was fine with me as I can still hear the music no problem. 

Waitress was our table in about 4 minutes and took our order and returned promptly with our drinks and came by fairly often to make sure we were good.

It seemed to get busier as the night went on and the crowd seemed to change which was interesting as I'm a people watcher so it was a good night overall. 

Definitely will be heading back with some friends and would like to try the bistro upstairs next time."}
{"text":"Two years later we are in town for our honeymoon. This place is our favourite. We have tried new meals and new wines. Still the best food we have had in Calgary. There is something to be said when it is our absolute favourite place to dine, yet not the most expensive by far. This place is classy, unique, and cozy. Extremely good value."}
{"text":"Service was great but food and potion size left a lot to be desired. Again our server was great but had too many tables to deal with. Other than the super salty poutine food was good but portions were really small and for the price and size would have been better at a more expensive place. Not the worst but probably not a repeat location."}
{"text":"Beat Niq drips of cool. Like the kind of cool you expect to find in 40s jazz places, with pinstripes, leopard print and an entrance through the kitchen with a door off the alley.

Sometimes when I walk into Beat Niq, I feel like the staff should address me as 'doll' and that something is about to 'go down'. This makes me glad to sit at a tiny table in a cramped basement bar, sip a hellava Belvedere martini and generally feel extra smooth.

The bands are always entertaining, and because the space is so small, it's very intimate. You feel like you're grooving right there on stage with the brass and bass.

On a particularly interesting side note, the owner both looks and sounds like Frank Sinatra; so if by some miracle of science you can swing tickets to a Frank show, don't pass it up. The music is very good and you will not regret it. (Also, bring me).

As mentioned, Beat Niq is small, so unless you can get Pic Niq (the delicious restaurant upstairs) to reserve you a table after your dinner, be sure to get there early. There is also a cover charge; be prepared to pay cash to get in. This give you the chance to practice something persuasive to say while you had over the bill like, 'my good friend the Queen Elizabeth thinks me and my pals are getting in here tonight...'.

Beat Niq is cool, it's groovy and you'll love the martinis. Try as you might, you may not be able to resist the urge to say, 'Hey Mac, can I get a Mark's on ice?' to the barman.

T."}
{"text":"Found my way to Beat Niq's via an UYE organized by the one they call the Angelo. Great live Jazz, though you may have to come a bit early to get good seats. Deadly martini's, eclectic crowd and Jazz tunes that make your soul climb out of you and shuffle to the groove. Not that I lifted myself into hyperbole or anything. Huge fan and I love this place!

Cover $15. Martini $10. One of the best atmospheres in Calgary ... priceless."}
{"text":"Go for the jazz, stay for the Gerussi Martini's. Srsly - you have to try these things, they're to die for."}
{"text":"So I've eaten here 3 times now. The reason I keep coming is because this place is a GREAT music venue. I so want to give it a better rating for that reason but I just can't. The service here is consistently questionable. Waiting forever for service and then being treated rudely when it finally comes. The food stinks. You can tell they really want to be a fancy place. The prices are jacked high and everything sounds good but either the cooks or the chefs do not seem to have the skill to deliver. It's very rare that food manages to disappoint me as much as Wine-ohs food does each time I eat here. I recommend you grab a bite at the Thai place next door before you go see the bands."}
{"text":"I'm in love! Wow, I really love the mushroom tart. I could eat it every moment of the day and night!!! 

Not only the mushroom tart makes me to wanna go back, the flavor and spices all together remember me of the food in Europe, full of taste! Finally a restaurant that makes me think of home! Besides the food also the entourage looks like a restaurant there is in holland and the wine is good, very good!!!!  

Heerlijk!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my birthday last Friday night. It took so long for our server to come over we were starting to wonder if there even was one. She was fairly new so we'll give her  the benefit of the doubt and assume the service will get better with time. The decision to write the review was based more on the food service. We were extremely dissapointed that night. Not only did it take almost an hour for a meat & cheese platter, salad, and appetizer to arrive, what was finally brought to us (after having to ask if our order had maybe not been placed) was extremely lackadaisical. The House Board consisted of some rolled up meat, a gigantic dollop of mustard, a bowl of cocktail olives, two deviled eggs, some cheese slices & crackers (crostini & rice) that looked as if someone has taken a handful out of the package and haphazadly strewn them onto the plate. For $24. The bistro salad greens were bitter and so underdressed you couldn't even taste the vinaigrette. The Arancini was the only enjoyable food item (it was delicious). We were so hungry by the time the food arrived that we ate most of it regardless. It feels like a shame to waste over $200 (we had wine & a couple drinks as well) for a meal like that. In the end, we wished we'd gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wine-Oh's reminds me of a cute little bistro that you find when you're in Europe. We only been there twice and the gentleman taking care of us both times, remembered us and was very accommodating - in fact the reason we went back the second time was because of the wonderful service we got from him previously.

The interior and feel is upscale and romantic without being pretentious. The food and drink menu is fantastic and decently priced.

On our latest visit we shared a charcuterie, salad and mussels and frites - all was absolutely amazing, I had not one complaint about the wine, the food or the service. 
After our meal we went downstairs to check out the live jazz scene. It was pretty cool and laid back. 

I would like to come back here and try out their free corkage night and also just to enjoy more of the fabulous food and service."}
{"text":"Great music and environment downstairs. Food is good as well.  Get there early for the best seats!"}
{"text":"After we shared a mushroom tart and decided it was delicious I watched a guy on another table recieve one. He took his first bite and really took the time to taste his dish. After he swallowed he took a moment to review his bite and then mentioned to his company how amazing that was.

Such a joy, visiting one of these rare places that just get it right. Great foot bursting with flavour, friendly serving, good atmosphere and people enjoying it."}
{"text":"28/30

I went here for my birthday one year; dressed in a red satin cocktail dress and metal heeled stilettos (that one of my dude friends told me made me sound like a clippety cloppety billy goat when I walked, hahahaha) and felt like a sophisticated grown-up lady. Who knew? 

Live jazz, with an amazing drummer who kept the beat even though at one point he was drumming so fast that one of his sticks flew out of his hand! Listening to amazing music, while sitting on a bar stool at the table, sipping red wine, nibbling on fresh fruit, bread and pear jam will make you feel so. money. 

The menu doesn't have very many vegan options, but you'll find that Beat Niq is pretty accommodating. I've been here several times since that Fancy Birthday and it's been an awesome time every time. 

Food service starts at 9 PM, and it's free corkage on Tuesday nights. Maybe one of these days, I'll be hip enough to have a membership. But then again, you know what Groucho Marx says about becoming a member of any place that would ~have~ you as a member... ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a fabulous, intimate place to go have dinner on a date. The place was quiet, but in a good way and the food was phenomenal. The place is relatively expensive - $130 for two of us to share a starter, have a great entree, dessert and one glass of wine each. It was worth every penny. The service was pleasant and thorough. The presentation of the food was nice and everything was cooked to perfection. If you want to have a great meal in downtown Calgary and feel like you are getting your money's worth, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"So disappointed! This used to be a place I loved to come. Lots of wine, cozy and live tunes downstairs. 

I came here for a stagette on the weekend. First off trying to book the spot was a challenge, they were unaccommodating and had all these rules for us. Some of us got there right at 5, and some slowly trickled in over the next hours. Let's be honest here, you're dealing with 12 girls, it's going to be slow. 

They were super antsy with us, as we had been there for an hour and hadn't ordered foo. I guess the numerous bottles of champagne wasn't enough. We got our food, which was good. I went with the trout, that came with beets, carrots and asparagus and a delicious sauce. 

Problem was it was so hot in there, we all felt nauseous. I could barely eat all my dinner, I had to keep going outside to cool off. Then we had finished eating and were chatting away, there was empty tables and no one waiting and they were trying to rush us out. We had gone up to get shots and the guy said no, here is the bill. Wow...

I left after dinner, as it was too hot and I didn't want to spend any more money, than I already had there, which was a lot. 

I can say this place is better at small gatherings, but if you're not ok with large groups, don't offer it."}
{"text":"I've loosely heard of Beat Niq Jazz Club from other people and never took much interest in going. What a fool I was-I still am, but much less of a fool these days-for not taking an earlier interest and checking this place out!

We stumbled into Beat Niq's Jazz basement on a cold night seeking adventure and people. There was a live performance and a gentleman visiting from down south brought Jazz I was somewhat familiar with but was introduced to. Heck, I'm not much of Jazz buff and only heard whatever Gabe A recommended me to listen to, but @ Beat Niq, you don't have to like Jazz to enjoy the atmosphere created by the place, pure cool.

While I never had the chance to check out their menus, a couple of cool ladies mentioned they had a GREAT french menu and drinks to boot. Oddly enough in our cordial exchange, I found out that they in turn, never checked out the Jazz performances. I can't think of too many places that offered two different but relatable experiences: Jazz and French food? Quite appropriate

Looking at their menu right now, I am most definitely going back for the risotto!

{"text":"So you grew up with a Mohawk, ripped jeans and patches of your favourite bands sewn with safety pins to a beaten up leather jacket, starting the rough but friend fights with your friends in the mosh pits of all ages shows at the old Multi Cultural Centre. Recently, you find yourself in love with the finer, more adult things in life. Maybe you appreciate the depth in a bold merlot. You enjoy learning more about food, discovering more about your palette and the way flavours compliment and contrast each other. You want to know and experience as much as you can in this flavourful adult world, but one thing stays the same: Who cares what others think?! WINE DICKS F&@$ OFF! They mantra may have changed, but you never will!

Now, I'm not sure if that was a description of Winos or myself, but either way it describes why I like it so much.

They've got a tonne of different wines on tap and are super helpful to point you in the direction of the one you didn't know you wanted.

Remember that live music you used to love? Do it again as an adult (maybe leave the mosh pit at home though) at Winos. They've got  a killer local folk and roots scene rarin' in the  speakeasy style basement. 

Enter from the alley through the side door, make your way past the kitchen and head downstairs. You'll feel like a rule breaker and the kid who knows all the cool underground music spots, and as you know, that's a pretty great feeling.

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Wine-ohs before the theater one night.  We hadn't been here since it was called Piq Niq back in the day.  It was excellent then and it's excellent now.  It is very small so there's only one waitress/bartender and the chef/owner will,in all likelihood, come out, say hello and ask how everything is.  My steak frites was excellent.  The wines by the glass are a real bargain.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just eat the damn duck legs.
They changed my life.   Think I saw duck Jesus.
The only problem was my drink tasted dirty.   I think they don't change the ice often enough."}
{"text":"I've been to Wine-Ohs twice this week! It's that good! The first time I ordered the Mushroom Tart - oh my! It was delicious! The mushrooms are cooked so delicately and piled high on the 3 pieces of puff pastry. The tarts sat on some arugula. Nice light lunch for a hot day. The second time, I had the Sea Bass - double oh my! The sea bass was so tender as it's pan-seared. It sat on a pea purée and a pile of the same mushrooms on the rectangular plate. Chef, you've outdone yourself!"}
{"text":"What a great little place - good food, great wine and really friendly staff!  My boyfriend and I were delighted to find this little spot on my first night in Calgary. We had the roasted nuts and shared the noodle bowl.  Both were very good.  The broth in the noodle bowl was wonderful and I could really taste the lemongrass, which I love. The bottle of wine we ordered (recommended based on our description of the wines we like) was a wonderful Grenache from Spain and the waitress happily recorked the bottle so we could take it back to the hotel.  We were never made to feel rushed but the service was super attentive.  Thumbs up and we'll be there tonight for open mike night in the cellar!  Oh, and all that for only 60 CAD!!!!"}
{"text":"I had stopped going to this place when it was still called Beatniq. We went back last week and I really enjoyed how the renovation in the basement has made it much more pleasant.

You will enjoy the music, the atmosphere, the service, the drinks and the food of course!
For weekends, make sure you check their website and events calendar. If you are going for the music in the basement, go early cause it can fill up really fast, especially if there is a good band performing.

Go on the weeknights, when there is open mic, and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Head down the alleyway behind Bistro Piq Niq until you find the grey metal door marked Beat Niq. Enter a backroom and head down the stairwell into a low lit club with a bit of red lighting. Bench seating and high tables line the walls, lower tables and chairs fill the rest of the space.

Order yourself a bees knees cocktail or something from the wine list. Sit back and enjoy the small and intimate show.

I was here for the first time last night, and now I'm wondering why I haven't crossed Beat Niq's threshold sooner. Watch for ticket prices, they weren't taking cover at the door, but it was added onto our bill.

Hungry? Some tapas and nibblets are available from the kitchen upstairs.

Go now, for I hear Beat Niq is due for some renovations in August. Best to have a before and after impression, n'est ce pas?"}
{"text":"A good friend took me to Wine-Ohs for lunch and we had the awesome mussels !  She had to pre-order this couple days to the chef for our reservations since it is not on the menu.  It was so tasty, we almosted licked the bowl clean !  Loved dipping our bread in the yummy garlicky sauce that was in the bowl once we finished off the little morsels of bliss .  I would order this again when I crave mussels for a light lunch .... so good...."}
{"text":"Love the live music venue downstairs however a group of us had dinner sat night here. The food took an hour and 40 min. One meal had to be sent back and four of our dinners were ice cold but we were so hungry and just wanted to get out of there so ate it anyway . Disappointing"}
{"text":"Good wine!!... Cool ambience and the appetizers are good too. For me the best one was the cheesse plate. It was really good. The music was cool, and the prices ok. This is a place where I would go back with a group of friends to have a good time and appetizers..."}
