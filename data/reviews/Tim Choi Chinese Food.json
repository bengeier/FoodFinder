{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food I've found in Scarborough! I ordered for the first time tonight and I love the food. Everything was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for exceptional Chinese food. I've tried many places in the area and this is the only place I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed. Every single dish was amazing, the general tao chicken is my fave so far. We'll be ordering from this place only from now on."}
{"text":"This is a takeout joint at some non-descript plaza in Scarborough.  There's two worn out couches inside, but the wait is very minimal, fifteen minutes you're out.  There's no dine-in option.  I tried the special dinner for four for $25.95 plus tax (pick up price) or $28.95 plus tax (delivery price).  What a great deal! They also have Sunday deals.  Okay, I love everything.  I live in the west end and wish that this place was closer to me.  Great value for great food.  I was weary at first, I thought this must be bland, oily Chinese takeout that skimp on the quality and quantity of meat and veggies.  This is far from the truth!!!  Ok... what does special B include? Spring rolls (4) - crispy, great size, not too oily. Everything was not oily but just right, great comfort food. Sweet & Sour spareribs - Awesome. Love. Crispy large pieces of pork in batter covered in sweet and sour sauce. Chicken lo mien - not too oily, great taste, had a lot of large good pieces of chicken! Beef with mixed vegetable - nice light sauce, with tons of tender beef, garlic pieces, brocolli, celery and carrots.  Deep fried chicken wings - Love.  Not too oily.  Good sized wings of similar size.  Does not include that extra tip on the wing. Like the wings you get in an American style joint. Chicken fried rice - not too oily, good, no complaint. Fortune cookies - what a great addition that is not always included in a takeout Chinese joint, also includes plum sauce and soy sauce.  I would definitely go back.  This place is legit.  There's no place in the west end that compares.  The west end Chinese joints are stingy with the meat, and don't give you what you think you're ordering (for ex beef brisket is actually brocolli with some fatty beef).  This place exceeded my expectations. I would do some more takeout whenever I hit up the east end of the GTA."}
{"text":"Tried on justeat.ca  I wouldn't recommend or order again. Ordered wonton soup with pork, general tso, egg roll and honey garlic wings.   The egg rolls had barely enough filling and tasted all salt. General tsos chicken tasted very different. Chicken was tender but the sauce was bland. Honey garlic wings were like double deep fried - I didn't try as I was expecting actual wings.  Wontons in the soup tasted off as well."}
{"text":"This has been my number one go to for Chinese takeout for the last 10 years!  The prices are very reasonable a family dinner for four is $21.95 plus tax so just under $25.  The chicken wings, egg rolls beef and broccoli are my favorite things on the menu. They are very willing to accommodate example sauce on the side more spice or less spice.  Even after all this time if my son wants Chinese food he always ask for this place by name"}
