{"text":"Try and catch the early bird special if you go.  For 8.95 you get a very good size salad, a (depending on what you get) big portion of whatever meat you decide on, two sides, and a dessert.  Now the reason for only three stars is me regretting my choice...  I know that isn't fair to the restaurant but usually when you order country fried chicken or a chicken fried steak it's pretty massive.  Mine was the smallest out of everyone else at the tables, and there were 8 of us.  While the chicken was good and I really liked the gravy I was still a little hungry at the end.  And key lime pie is not my idea of dessert.  So I guess I just happened to hit a bad day.  Maybe next time I go they'll have chocolate pie, or something not key lime (My grandparents liked it, but I just couldn't eat it, so sour!).  From the looks of the other plates, the salmon was the winner."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for good food.

It doesn't seem practical to visit a casino just for a good meal, but I think Willows Restaurant in Casino Arizona is well-worth the trip. Tonight, we had the prime rib special, a good, tender, well-seasoned prime with a large baked potato, vegetable and your choice of soup or salad for only $13.95! The taste is comparable to a Black Angus experience but much less expensive. There are also hearty, delicious portions during the lunch time. Definitely try their daily specials! 

Service was fast (we didn't have to wait for a table at the 5:45ish time frame), fairly friendly, with consistent bussing and refill service. The restaurant is clean with impressive decor of traditional Native art on the walls and intimate booths for parties from 2 to 6 people. Parking can be tough if you are only going to dine and not gamble but there is a valet. Because the gambling never ends, the restaurant never closes. Good meal, good service, great price."}
{"text":"I've been having breakfast at the Willows Restaurant for the past 5 years. The staff including the manager Sally, waitresses Lucy & Starr do an excellent job. They are always willing to go the extra mile to make sure my food is prepared according to my requirements. If there is ever an issue and there have been very few, they do whatever they can to make sure I'm taken care of. For the price the food is excellent. The service is second to none.  I would highly recommend the Willows Restaurant."}
{"text":"Friday night special of NY strip steak and crab legs HORRIBLE. Steak overdone and touch, full of unchewable sinew and gristle; crab legs soft, couldn't crack. Had to leave most of meal on plate. Didn't even have seafood tools when asked for them. Waitress did find small forks but almost worthless when couldn't even get meat out of legs.  We have been coming here for years to eat but sure won't order steak or crab legs again. Is the buffet this bad, too?"}
{"text":"Although service is good, food is ok. Our meat was hard and rubbery. Chicken was hard as a rock. Sad because the service is exceptional. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now.  The food is \"OK\".  Nothing to brag about.  Tonight my husband and I had a ribeye.  It was a little over $20.  You started with a soup or salad.  I had salad that was fresh and crisp with good blue cheese dressing.  I requested our food be expedited as we were a little short of time.  It came right out before we finished the salad.  Our beverages arrived after the salad.  The steaks were cooked OK but were greasy and full of fat.  I had a nice big baked potato and fresh green beans with mine.  You get a choice of 2 sides.  NO bread of any kind is served with the meal.  The waitress (after taking awhile to get to the table) turned out to be fast and friendly.  On a previous visit (during the summer) we were pestered with flies but not tonight.  If you're at the Casino it's a good choice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Food is ok not that great for the price you pay. Ordered the breakfast corn beef hash and that was disgusting indeed! The peppered they cooked with were so over powering I had to pick it out and force my self to finish the meal because I was hungry. Had a burger last night 03/24/2017 and that gave me a heart burn and bad breathe from the seasoning they to it. I don't recommend it being it looked like a hockey puck but again was hungry . If your seriously hungry and your last resort and you become hangry go for it but if you have options please don't stop here for food! No being picky I'm trying to save your taste buds and money for something better tasting"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before with no complaints about food or service, however, when i went there late saturday/early sunday october 5 the service and food were THE WORST. I believe there were 2 male waiters, one was asian and the other one was the worthless, poor excuse for a server we had the misfortune of being stuck with. It was after 2 am so I could not order a beer, but I would have liked to order a coke. They brought out 2 waters, never asked if we wanted anything else to drink, & took food order. I ordered sirloin steak (medium). After waiting for what seemed like forever for food to come out I tried the steak. The first part was somewhat undercooked but it had a good flavor. I cut into the other part and it was less done than rare. This completely grossed me out and I asked if they could cook it a little more. The manager came by and said she didn't blame me for sending back. They took whole plate & eventually one of the waitresses asked if I wanted a salad. Then after waiting for what seemed like forever again, they bring the plate back out. I believe they took the other piece, butterflied it, and cooked it until it was beyond well done-to the point of basically being leather. I tried one bite & it was just disgusting & had no flavor. My french fries were now gross tasting like they stuck them under a heat lamp that whole time. When the manager brought it back out I asked for the check, ketchup & a fork. She gave me new silverware roll & never brought the check, ketchup, or checked back to see if everything ok. After waiting & waiting I got the asian waiter's attention & asked if he could have them remove steak from the bill and bring it. Finally the bill came & I paid and left $1 and some change for tip (bill went down to $9.18) I am a server myself and I know it wasn't his fault the steak wasn't done right, but he never checked back on us, apologized, or anything. If he would have seemed to care at all about our table I would have left the change from a $20 & his tip would have been slightly more than the check even ended up being. I had 2 words for their comment card--THE WORST. I hope they look at Yelp reviews and take them even 1/2 as serious as my restaurant does. The manager & our waiter were 2 of the most useless employees I have come across in a very long time. I live 2 miles down the road now and have started going to Casino Az quite often now, but I think this was my last visit to The Willows-oh well, their loss."}
{"text":"Short and sweet : 
Service was fine WHEN the did come around.

coffee was luke warm at best.
My thai salad was soggy and had the heat level of a lighting bolt being shoved in my mouth.
My wifes \"hard poached\" eggs were harder and dryer then hard boiled eggs. 

There was only a few customers in there but the food took so long you would have thought they were slammed. 

My recommendation would be to go to the buffet. Or the little caf√© across the casino floor from it."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hrs only on Friday and Saturday the yelp hours are wrong so call first.  
Anyway I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad its verry large and filling it comes with bread and butter with a garlic taste. Cost is only $10"}
{"text":"This is a place I have eaten at on and off over the years, the quality of the food depends on what night you go there, like all buffets some good some bad. But when they are on , it is really good. The Waite staff is very attentive.Love the seafood night on Fridays."}
{"text":"The food here is ok but the service here has always been top notch. This is usually our late night spot to eat after a night of festivities since nothing else is open and no where else will you get a prime rib dinner for like 8 bucks or something like that. 

The staff remembers us, but they probably remember everyone which is awesome and they have never slacked when I've been there.

This review is mainly about the food since i gave it 3 stars but the staff deserves the full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great spot for a late night dinner. They're open 24/7 on fridays and saturdays. They close early every other day so keep that in mind. I had the Veggie burger with toasted onions, guacamole and cheedar cheese on top with sweet potato fries on the side. It was delicious! My girl had a ceasar salad with grilled chicken and it was so huge and she loved it. We will be coming bacm for sure! Great food and service. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waited over 30min to get a seat for a party of 5 when over half the restaurant is empty. Most of the waiters and waitresses seem to wander around aimlessly. It's going on 45 minutes and we've yet to get any food. Might be fine with the wait if they had anything more interesting than \"generic breakfast plate\" but all the menu choices seem super lackluster.

Food has arrived after about 50 minutes. Everything is tepid, meat is chewy, eggs are over hard (i had asked for over medium). The pancakes are a bit dense for my personal taste but that's more of a preference thing. Unfortunately the butter served with the pancakes tastes like some disgusting amalgam of whatever they had in the fridge.

Overall extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to soak up some suds before getting in the car and driving. This restaurant is rather small and the decor is somewhat tacky. But who cares when you need to eat something and you do not want to spend an arm and a leg.

The medium sized menu here has most of the familiar items and favorites that you would see in your typical restaurants. They have different specials that change on occasion.

Usually stop here with other Yelpers after seeing one of the tribute bands. Miss Jolly M. and her man Heath are one of our favorite dining guest and we always have a blast. Last time we all played KENO at the table and had a good 20-30 minutes of laughter and excitement. My number 8 popped up at least 4-5 times. Hmmm?

Usually get the SW Burger and have them bring out Hot Sauce and some Atomic Horseradish. The Reuben is also a favorite and taste really good. Others have ordered the Steak and Eggs with Hashbrowns and Toast or the Chicken Salad Sandwich on a Croissant with Fries.

Food is decent and the prices are out of this world cheap. Just take you time and kick back. You always want to make sure to let the suds soak in good before getting behind the wheel. See you there next time. BEEP BEEP!

{"text":"My suggestion?  Go for breakfast!  I have been here a few times and received spotty service: either my coffee cup is filled after every sip, or I am left to wonder if the waitstaff even know that I've been seated!  However, it is hard to ruin breakfast and you cannot beat the price: $6.25 for 2 eggs, hashbrowns, choice of meat, and toast.  I can't decide whether I like the cheap eats or the valet service better!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot. I had the Lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food. But good prices and decent food."}
{"text":"Seating was slow even though there were many open tables and the front end staff didn't seem to have it together.  Table staff were good and professional but service was slow.  Prime rib was ok but I wouldn't go back for that dish.  2-3 stars based on the slow seating service and mediocre food.  Gave it three as the caesar side salad was really good as were the hot rolls, prime rib just ok."}
{"text":"Breakfast. The best crispy chicken fried steak and eggs this side of Texas. Served with country gravy, hash browns and garnished with a slice of cantaloupe and honey dew melon for under $7. The green chili cheese burger is also one of my favorites, served any time of day or night. Only down side is getting past all the unwashed morons gambling and chain smoking cigarettes."}
{"text":"This was a default restaurant because a few in our group had recently eaten and didn't want to commit to the holiday buffet pricing.

There was a wait to get in and we actually missed our call because we wandered over to the bar to gather. When we returned they had us wait exactly 5 minutes and then seated us in a half empty dining room.

Service was about as casual as it gets, not overly polite or engaging but she got the job done. Since it was Christmas service got a pass and a big tip.

Everyone complemented the food, My brother said his chicken salad on a croissant was excellent. the boys had cheese steaks and acted surprised they were so good. I had a southwestern chicken pasta and it was pretty darn good and assembled well. The kitchen seemed to be running well, and that's probably because of the way the manager paced the seating and didn't fill the room.

The room itself is showing its age, the tablecloths on the tables were ugly, lighting was incorrect and staff was seen dragging tray jacks and pushing around a rack of glasses on wheels to place dirty dishes on. I found these faults just a little tacky and the reason for less stars."}
{"text":"This is a very chill place to kick back and have a casual meal before and after a hard night of gambling or taking in a show. 

The last time I was here was before The Doors cover band Strange Days show. I had a Rueben sandwich with fries. The service was great and the Rueben was excellent as well. I'll need to try different items the next time around based on some other Yelper reviews."}
{"text":"The specials they have that you can put together on your own is convenient, I love their breakfast burrito deal because you get this huge breakfast burrito with hash browns which I love! But the two together is so Good!!! Also they have amazing milkshakes if you get the strawberry and chocolate together its like having a chocolate covered strawberry in a cup! better to go here than dennys on a late night out."}
{"text":"Came here for a little dinner. Service is exceptional and the food has some variety. I ordered the chicken wings with blue cheese. It was good, but just like any other wings. This place used to be open 24/7 which was nice because after the club or if you were just craving food late night it was the place to go to. So, after they stop doing that, we barely come here."}
{"text":"The Willows @ Casino Arizona is a stellar restaurant specializing in American food. It's extremely clean, beautiful, the staff & management (I just love the manager, Joseph!) are ultra-professional & welcoming, the food is delicious-everything I've eaten here- & the prices are \"oh so sweet!\" One can get a wonderful large Angus specialty burger with a choice of a fantastic side- without an extra charge- a large cup of the best homemade soup, & a large gourmet desert with coffee for $11.00. The ambiance is beautiful & relaxing."}
{"text":"Convenient for gamblers here at Casino.  
It is not a place I would typically consider a possible option.  The smell of smoke was prominent upon walking into the casino.  Blech!
Menu is simple.  Prices are good for breakfast.  Not sure if they're understaffed on this particular day or what but it took a half hour to be seated because they were slammed by a large party.
Upon being seated I see the place is not even close to being full.
Our server was very pleasant and prompt. She took our order efficiently and was good about the specific details.
The food itself was nothing special."}
{"text":"Tried the seafood pasta special here a year or so ago and was underwhelmed- too much crayfish and not much flavor, as I recall.  Desserts here are much better, though; Warning: those with a sweettooth should be extra careful dining at The Eagles Buffet next door, especially on Mother's Day... unless you have the discipline to put extra time at the gym!

Had lunch here today (3/10)- turkey club (smoked turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and mayo on fresh croissant) and crispy sweet potato fries as my choice of side.  Yes, I chose this spot only bec. I had a craving for SPF!  

I only had 30 minutes' time alloted for lunch (which explains the lack of photos), but I thought a simple sandwich and fries wouldn't take much time.  Was I wrong!  First of all, it took 5 minutes from the moment I was seated at the table for my server to take my order.  Second, my order took more than 15 minutes to arrive, but I had to send the fries back as they were very soggy.  After a few minutes, however, these fries were perfect!  The sandwich included processed turkey slices (circular slices straight from the bag) and a lettuce leaf that was just large enough to span the length and width of the croissant.  I did appreciate the fact that the slices of bacon were pretty lean- I am one to trim off cooked fat from bacon before placing them back in my sammies.  (I know I'm NOT the only one that does this!)  

I wouldn't recommend the turkey club or other sandwiches where processed meats might be used.  Perhaps the entrees would be your best bet (pun intended!).  I DO suggest you try the desserts (I spied small glasses of milkshakes being delivered to their lucky owners) and the extra-crispy sweet potato fries.  Neighbors ooh'ed and ahh'ed over their lovely slices of strawberries and cream cake with coffee."}
{"text":"This place used to be alright, but now it only serves the dregs of the casino Buffet. Even if you are starving at 1 in the morning, just save yourself the disapointment and the high prices and just go to Dennys instead."}
{"text":"Breakfast at the Willows is great with Star as our waitress it was a pleasure  to just relax and not worry about the bill and food was as ordered"}
{"text":"I guess it's about time I review this place. 

For as many times as I've been here, it's always been for breakfast and I think all but maybe a couple of those times have been weekdays. As a result the place normally isn't that crowded. 

The food here is pretty solid, especially for how reasonably priced it is. I normally get an omelet or whatever the daily special is (which most of the time is some sort of \"specialty\" omelet). For $6.25 you get a three egg omelet w/three add-ins, hash browns & toast. I don't know what it is, but this place has REALLY good hash browns! They're crispy on the outside & really soft on the inside, which is how I like them. The Willows also has really good coffee (for a buck), and I like that they leave a carafe at your table so that you can control refills. 

For the most part I've always experienced good service (it probably doesn't hurt that by this point I've been coming here so often w/my parents that most of the servers recognize us). Then again, like I mentioned earlier, weekday breakfasts here aren't all that crowded. Not much to say about the atmosphere. It's a little diner inside a casino, so it is what it is."}
{"text":"Casino Arizona & The Willows - We were looking for a place to have a good steak,  at 1am. No one open, anyplace worth waiting all day for that is. From the valet, Nolan, to the security guard Dan! Outstanding service. Ruth at The Willow was worth way more than they are paying her,  I'm sure. The food was amazing, service excellent, facility spotless. Being in a wheelchair makes for difficult journeys, not here...  tiled walkways and Dan. That guy opened doors,  and even waited for our car to be brought up, all while his wonderful personality genuinely shined through;5 such a friendly, fun place. It's worth the time and effort to check them out. Be warned,  you'll leave with a smile :)"}
{"text":"Late night prime rib after a night in old town is the best!  Even though we have been asked to leave (sometimes more politely than others) they always welcome us back with open arms!  I can't stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Service is sometimes slow though.good place to go to for dinner,drinks,and fun!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for the all-you-can-eat crab leg nights, and always enjoy  the food.  But lately I heard that they are now doing a dim sum variety, I had to check this out.  It's a great price from 10-3 for & $9.99 and for a cheap buffet, there is a lot of variety.
The dim sum part of the buffet is just someone standing there and you basically pick out what what is available.  There about ten or twelve things to pick from and they only give you a portion of what they usually give at a real dim sum restaurant.  But then again, it's a buffet so you can always go back.  I'm usually used to loud Asian ladies trying to get a lot of items on your table and enticing you to try things you never tried before and stamping the heck out of your bill!  But besides the dim sum, the buffet offers lots of variety also from Mexican, Asian, and American varieties.  The BBQ baby back ribs are so good!  Also what I'm pleased with is for the cheap price, they have a great dessert area with an ice cream machine.  
Casino Arizona always does a good job in making their buffets worth the price.  I will definitely be back!"}
