{"text":"I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine, but I visited this establishment using a group coupon voucher.  The starters were shrimp wrapped in a taquito-like shell, and a mango salad.  I enjoyed the shrimp, but I found the mango salad was too sweet to be a good appetizer.  For the mains my companion and I ordered a tofu curry and chicken in a cashew sauce with noodles, respectively.  

Nothing unusually striking with my chicken dish.  The flavor was quite acceptable and portion size was good.  My companion didn't have any complaints about the curry dish, and she even brought home the leftovers.  Dessert consisted of two pieces of fried banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Both were quite appealing, though I accidentally got some of the fried banana syrup on my finger.  The syrup was incredibly sticky and I had to wash it off at a sink as merely using a napkin was not enough.

The dining area is small (under 10 tables), and the service was excellent.  I did not see a picture of the Thai king on the wall, which to my understanding every Thai restuarant ought to have.  But it certainly seems like a nice neighborhood place to go to as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I think it's about time I review this place.  I have checked out a good portion of the menu and they are all winners.  Very consistent and quite good.  You should check out the mango with sticky rice though, awesome dessert.  I also like how their dishes have lots of vegetables so I dont have the usual guilt eating it.  I'd give them a 6 if the delivery would be under 5 minutes, but that would be too good."}
{"text":"I called to order delivery for just myself. My meal itself only came to $11, but they added $5 for delivery - a bit steep in my opinion, especially considering I'm just a 2 minute drive around the corner from the restaurant. So my meal came to about $20, tax and tip all in. The container with my chicken curry was filled to the top, but mostly with liquid and random vegetables, hardly any chicken. The amount of rice they gave me was MINISCULE and MUSHY. I can't believe I paid $20 for the tiny amount of mediocre food I got. Needless to say, I won't be ordering delivery from here again. I was starving and really craving delicious Thai food.. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Considering vast number of other Thai places, this place should not be considered. Place smelled like cleaning fluid. Pad Thai TASTED like cleaning fluid. Fresh rolls were not fresh and had no flavour. Decent spice to the eggplant. Curry was forgettable."}
{"text":"We have dined in this restaurant twice but it is always our go to for delivery.

The food is excellent. I recommend the starter platter. The curry pockets are pillows of heaven. For an entree the cashew chicken is my favourite. ( I love sweet spicey sauce. )

All food items can be ordered with your choice of meat or tofu.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. The music, decore and food presentation give this place a very upscale feel.

The staff is excellent at answering questions and they fill your water glasses without even being asked.


The only bad thing is your meals may not come all at the same time. We waited 5 minutes for the other side of our table to get their food. But you can't really complain when it's as delicious as it is."}
{"text":"We had a great celebratory meal at Royal Elephant tonight!  We sampled most of the appetizers and main dishes, and everything was delicious. The deserts were especially creative and perfectly prepared.  Service was excellent, and the food was served promptly. 

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"very bad.
Tough chewy beef, sauce too sweet and non-descript, mushy noodles, fish not fresh and stinks, rice -blah. not much care given to the food, on the other hand the server was very nice.
I was looking forward to it, now I'm regretting it."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue!
I cant tell you how long i have been looking for a good thai restaurant in my area.
The food and service at this restaurant is AMAZING. 
I LOVE their peanut curry beef and sticky rice! The pad thai is always on point. and the Curry Pockets are a must. 
I have ordered from them 4 times just this month, im addicted!"}
{"text":"Went to night.  Food was good.  service absolutely terrible.  They served each of 6 of us one at a time.  We had children with ustoo!  Furthermore ...no apology or discount for the treatment.

Definitely don't go unless you want to spend 2 hours waiting for food and eating individually.

{"text":"NEVER AGAIN

Placed an order and was looking forward to trying this place out. First, they didn't have what I ordered and I had to substitute. They wouldn't credit the $3 difference, so I had to order a drink to make it balance.

Order arrived without the rice for my Green Curry. I called and, after much confusion, was told they don't include rice if you order off Just-Eat, only if you order direct from them (no sign of that on the Just Eat menu, either).

Staring at a container of green curry wondering what to do..."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, lacking flavour, and the waitress forgot 2 of our orders. We reminded her 3 times and she only brought 1 out of 2 of our forgotten orders. We finished the meal and they still hadnt brought out the last dish we ordered. We informed the waitress and she gave us a complimentary appetitizer. Therefore, service was lacking but the waitress was friendly. However, the food was nothing special and I wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area where Thai food is plentiful, authentic, and delicious - I wish I could say the same about thai food I've experienced in Toronto. My bf lives a few blocks away from here so we decided to drop in on our lazy snow day and give this place a try. 

We ordered the pre-fixe King's special and a cup of Tom Yum soup on the side. We subbed out shrimp pad thai for chicken pad thai. The pad thai here is probably the one of the tastiest I've had in Toronto thus far (more tasty than the revered Khao San Road everyone loves to overrate over here). 
The sizzling beef was tasty as well, however more so reminiscent of general taos chicken as it is breaded, fried, and tossed in some sweet and sour sauce (- not exactly an authentic thai experience, but I understand they've got a demographic to cater to in this area.)
The Tom Yum soup was a little too sweet and overly flavored with tomato base, but not terrible. 
Shrimp rolls are basic and hard to mess up. 
I wish I could write a review on the Mango salad that was supposed to come with our order, but it was apparently forgotten or misplaced in the bagging process. 

As someone who has visited different parts of Thailand multiple times and also as an Asian American bred in the Bay Area, I would definitely put this place on par with Panda Express. However, being that good Thai food is sparse in this city, I'm going to give this place 4 stars as it does do a good job to temporarily pacify one's Thai cravings (and also because the other, higher rated Thai places on Yelp here are outrageously misleading). 

My Canadian boyfriend gives two thumbs up on everything, but the soup."}
{"text":"So here was the lunch I was speaking of earlier on my check in. 

There isn't much to write home about this place.  It was pretty dead for lunch.  Just my colleague and I and one 4 other people were in there.  

Lunch specials are $10 and were pretty healthy portions I'd say.  I had the pad thai with chicken.  Comes with mango salad and a spring roll.  Mangos were not even ripe.  The pad thai was kind of bland, I needed to add hot sauce with it.  My colleague ordered cashew with coconut rice and chicken.  The sauce was very runny but I guess you mixed it in with the rice.  

We ended up being the only people in the place for a good hour,  The server was in the back playing with her tablet and didn't bother us while we were discussing business.  It was decent and something different but don't know if I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Had a pretty average experience here. It was pretty deserted for a Saturday night. The Pad Thai wasn't the greatest, don't recommend it at all. The masaman curry and green curry were good. Overall, an average place for a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened around 10 months ago.  

My husband loves the snapper which is deep fried and served in a Tamarind sauce (you have your choice for the flavour of the sauce).  It is absolutely delicious.

Their cold rolls are wonderful and lately they have served them with a peanut/coconut sauce (that may have some tamarind in it as well) - very lip-smacking.

Their mango salad is one of the best in town.  We also go to Sit-in-Bangkok and I think theirs may be a touch better, but, not much.

Their vegetarian tofu dish is just wonderful - multi-coloured veggies in a lovely thai sauce.

The decor is calm, the waiters are more than helpful.  Major thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, and excellent food... They even made me an absolutely delicious curry version of their Pad Thai when I asked! (It's not an item on their usual menu). And very affordable to boot! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just got some takeout yesterday.  I'm vegetarian so my options are limited and there aren't too many restaurants in this area that are completely vegetarian.  I walk past this place regularly so I wanted to see what it was like.  I ordered the cashew tofu and my boyfriend ordered the mango tofu (spicy).  We also got an appetizer of spring rolls.

The spring rolls were good.  The dishes were okay.  Nothing stood out.  It was just \"okay\".  Not a lot of flavour in mine but my boyfriend's was very spicy.  I liked the tofu pieces but he did not.  Not enough vegetables in it... very few.  Decent portions, decent prices.

I wouldn't avoid this place but I won't actively try to go back.  It does have more vegetarian options than other places (so I'd go here over a steakhouse or even just a regular restaurant with few veg options) but I'd rather just find another restaurant in general."}
{"text":"Order deliver from Royal Elephant on just-eat. I got the red curry, tom yum soup, and mango rolls. The order came to almost $40 (including tip and the just-eat/Restaurant's delivery fee). Price wise, it was quiet a bit for a single individual. 

The food arrived in 45 minutes as promised. Delivery driver is ... meh. He wasn't the friendliest but wasn't the worst either. The tom yum soup was okay. I've had better. The mango rolls were good. It was a bit misleading as the menu says '6 rolls/pieces' - so you think you're getting 6 full rolls. You are actually getting 6 pieces that are pre-cut. Regardless, the rolls, I would say, was the best item I got. The red curry was okay as well. I was a bit disappointed as I ordered from Royal Elephant because of the reviews on Yelp. I've had better red curries around Toronto and around various parts of the world. I would say that this red curry was more water-y than the other curries I've seen. 

Overall, 3/5 stars. Would I order from here again? Maybe - mostly if I'm lazy, don't want to leave my house, craving Thai food, and feel like splurging. Other than that, I'd probably resort to making my own Thai curry at home."}
{"text":"I like thai very much, but never have I had an amazing thai meal, but they are always solid. 
Usually I stick to the cheap places in the Annex but this was my birthday dinner so we lived largely. 
That being said it was still very affordable but we felt fancier because it was a nicely decorated place. And I happen to love elephants so the name made me happy :)

The beef tamarin curry was AMAZING. I generally dont do beef but we got it and it was my favourite of all the dishes. it was kind of fried and then put into lettuce with light sauce but was awesome, kind of chewy...
The curries we got were also good and so was the pad thai and fried banana. 
I would say my experience here was a good star or half star over my general experiences in the annex, and the waiter was such a sweetie pie. 

It's slightly more expensive but its a real dine out experience more than a take out kind of experience."}
{"text":"I called from the road around nine to place a pick-up order - sweet gal on the phone responded well to my usual and epically vague asian cuisine order: \"hot, very hot, with shrimp and noodles of some description.\" She suggested a red curry and said it would be ready in 20 or less. 

The had it in a thermal bag on the counter when I arrived, curry in a very full but tightly sealed plastic container which did not leak all over the floor of my car, noodles in separate styrofoam.

The positively lovely girl at the counter tells me the owners of Sala Thai (which I had been to and liked well enough) had gone back to Thailand, and good friends had take over and rebranded - quite nicely I might add. It does look lovely in there. 

Be sure to ask for condiments if you want them - there weren't any in my bag. 

I was a little late picking up the order so I will forgive the rice noodles being a pretty well formed brick - the curry itself was still super hot (temperature wise) and gave me a relatively runny nose (flavor wise.) Great taste and 10 or so good quality (and size) shrimp which were not overcooked - this is always my issue with takeout food. Skimping on the shrimping. Not the case here.

Lunch specials look to be great value - wish I worked in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We decided to order food after trying them at T&T's night market snad enjoyed their green curry as it tasted very authentic.

We ordered take out on the holiday Monday. 

Papaya Salad, Mango Salad, Green Curry Fish, Golden curry chicken, pad thai shrimp, pad woon sen chicken, eggplant basil sauce, khao soi (noodle dish veggie and tofu).  Meal was $93 in total, came with some rice.

Good:  green curry tasty though hubby thought it wasn't as good as when were at T&T, pad thai good tamarind flavour
I liked the papaya salad.  Hubby who has been to thailand is stuck on a particular style he had from the north ..east? I think.  

Mango salad was average.  Nothing special but not bad either.
Pad woon sen was good but not enough noodles.
Eggplant dish not enough eggplant and sauce was very thin.
khao soi is a new dish for me..came with a curry gravy and it was okay..maybe with an explanation of how the dish should be eaten.

Overall, I would use them if convenient.  I thought it would had been nice to get a discount for takeout or some extras.  And I bit pricey for the amount of food."}
{"text":"Great local thai restaurant. Not fancy, but incredibly clean, nice looking, and wonderfully accommodating staff. Food is delicious and plentiful. Highly recommend if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was last night at the Gourmet Food & Wine Expo.  

After walking around -and a couple glasses of wine of course- I came to a complete stop when this amazing smell just hit me at once, I asked out-loud (directing the question to my boyfriend) WHERE... IS... THAT... SMELL... COMING... FROM ?  two or three people pointed at Royal Elephant's stand on my left.

It was their chicken satay skewers OMG!!!! that was the first bite of the night, what my taste buds where dreaming of since lunch time, what a lil teaser.  

Kept walking around and... WELL.... I tried nothing else except for some cheeses, I had to go back again and...... then again!.   That was my dinner, 3 of those amazing lil things... (I think I purchased the last 2 and now regret having shared one with my BF ;)) .... I refused to try anything else the whole evening *raises eyebrows and shoulders* I dunno!! these lil skewers got me good!

I didn't try any of their other dishes, but there was a lineup of anxious people waiting to be served and the stand was busy all 3 times that I came by.  I can only speak of their chicken satay and say .... BEST I've tried in TO, too bad they are not downtown or better yet just around the corner from my house! .... 

mmm .... maybe I can lure them into disclosing the secret recipe ;) 

Ohhh and the guy grilling them was super nice and the girl passing them wrapped in napkins just adorable! she must have found my addiction quite amusing!"}
{"text":"We recently ordered from this restaurant and I didn't enjoy the food at all.  The pad thai tasted too much of fish sauce and the green curry was very watery.  The mango salad was the only thing we ordered that we enjoyed.  We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We dropped by because we saw it on the way. We didn't sample too many dishes, but what we ate was excellent. The service was great too. Wasn't extremely impressed with the fried calamari (the batter bits were falling off) but other stuff was delicious. A very nice quiet restaurant."}
