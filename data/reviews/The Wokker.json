{"text":"My family has been getting our Chinese food from The Wokker for nearly two decades, mostly because we don't like change - but also because the food has remained consistently delicious all these years. The inside of the restaurant isn't great anymore. It's old and tired and definitely in need of a revamp. But, the staff is really friendly and they get pickup orders ready very quickly. They're open late, it's inexpensive and the food is fresh and tasty. Call ahead, pick it up, take it home. Portions are healthy.   Our standards (after years of occasionally straying to other menu items, only to return) are  -Cantonese Chow Mien Wokker Style, full of chicken, pork, shrimp and tons of veggies.  -General George Beef, served with broccoli and orange wedges  -Sweet and Sour Chicken Chunks Wokker Style, lightly breaded chunks of chicken stir-fried in sauce with pineapple, carrots and sweet peppers  -Spicy Ginger Beer, thin slices of beef served with shredded carrot and beansprouts in tons of ginger and garlic.  Oh, and they offer a 10% discount for pick up orders which are paid for by cash."}
{"text":"I found this place in a review at the back of the Metro (where I get all my news) about a year ago.  I actually clipped the article and put it on my fridge as I didn't want to forget to go there.  When we moved house the clipping moved with us, a constant reminder of a promise made to oneself.  After keeping the clipping for so long, I was just praying I hadn't made a huge mistake.  My prayers were answered, and I can proclaim that the Wokker lived up to it's billing (as far as the Metro was concerned at least).  Word to the wise, if you have a high-maintenance girlfriend (or boyfriend), DO NOT BRING THEM TO THIS RESTAURANT.  It's authentic chinese food, and the interior and decor are along much the same lines.  Let's just say you don't need to dress up in order to feel comfortable.  You will not impress a first date with this place.  That being said, if you like good chinese food at great prices, you will not be disappointed.  I recommend the set dinner, I had the duckling and (like the Metro columnist) I could be heard eliciting squeals of delight with every bite.  Vegetables and rice were very good too.  Spring rolls and wonton soup, the duckling with rice and vegetables, topped off with green tea ice cream, all for the very low price of $12.95.  My wife had the Pad-Thai, she was disappointed as there was a slightly burnt flavour to it (I had to taste it myself in order to critique it :)), even still I ended up finishing it for her as I hate to waste good food, that I owe to my late Irish granny who would give us stale biscuits (cookies to Canucks) when we came to visit.  Try the Wokker, even if there's nobody in there."}
{"text":"At first glance this seems like a dirty place that was decorated in the 1970's. The place mats are those corny \"year of the animal\" thing that has been around since for ever.  The seats are uncomfortable and reminded me of the seats in my childhood school bus.  Ok, thats the bad part. Now the good part. The food is amazing and cheap. I had the lunch special, a huge plate of Pad Thai for 5.99. But, this wasn't just any Pad Thai, it has shrimp, chicken, fresh broccoli, collard greens and the noodles were perfect. Diamond in the rough for sure.  5 stars if they upgrade their interior a touch."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered a chicken with broccoli combo for delivery. I opened my meal after the driver left and what I actually got was chicken mix vegetables. When I called for them to correct my order, they refused saying \"chicken broccoli\" always comes with carrots and onions. After a large battle with the woman she still refused to correct my order, or offer me anything to entice me to order again.  Needless to say, I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from The Wokker for 15 years. Big recommendation: order during the week, the weekend cook is totally different quality.   This place is mostly for take out or delivery. I've dined in but the seating is so uncomfortable you don't want to stay a minute after you've finished your meal, which is too bad because the ambience is nice.  They serve the freshest Chinese food I've ever eaten. The Mongolian beef sticks and sesame shrimp are incredible.   The woman who runs the place is very polite and precise with your order. If a mistake has been made with your order, it's probably because you didn't specify your needs, they never make order mistakes in the 15 years that I've been ordering.  You can order your dish anyway you want it. I don't eat green peppers and they have no problem omitting it from any dish that I order. You can practically custom order any dish according to your taste.  They're delivery times are consistent and I've never had a dish arrive cold, it's always hot."}
{"text":"Very simple: i eat here all the time. good food good value. customers here are talking about how the prices are lower then they expected. great for take out. eat is in an... experience. its fun but not high rent. one of fav places in the hood. the people writing about the lack of drinks. uh... this is a chinese restaurant. like the one reviewer said, they came here before a concert at the opera house. that explains it. its not a drinking bar. go across the street for that (or jilly's). but if you want good canadian chinese food this is a great place to get it."}
