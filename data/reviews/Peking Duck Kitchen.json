{"text":"Went here yesterday to get some peking duck.  But, i was disappointed and I've had better elsewhere.  Price was on par with other establishments but the duck tasted oily and stale.  the sauce is very thick on bean flavour.

However, their other cooked dishes were made well."}
{"text":"We drove by and saw the sign for Peking duck and couldn't resist the opportunity to try a new place. We weren't disappointed. The duck was top notch and in true Beijing style, not the sweet anisey flavoured Cantonese style duck served at most places (which is fine - just not Poking duck). Only difference with what you'd find in Beijing is the lack of fruit wood flavour, but that's pretty hard to replicate here. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to PDK.  The quality of food including Peking Duck and other dishes were all excellent.  The duck was roasted to perfection with crispy skin and hardly any fat.  The pancakes were thin and soft, better than any other place in Toronto.  I really liked the variety of Duck parts offered; liver, gizzard, heart, feet, bones etc.  My only complaint during my previous visit was the less than adequate service due to shortage of servers.  They were fully staffed this time, and were all friendly and efficient.  The positive attitude definitely started from the top down.  There are still many dishes I haven't tried, and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Went for an 8:30PM Monday night dinner. House was packed. We got the last table. There were only two of us, so we over ordered a bit: Peking duck, deep fried garlic shrimp, lotus root and black fungus salad, and spicy and sour sliced dry tofu sheet.

The duck was delicious, as expected. Shrimp were very crisp, and wonderfully garlicky. Excellent. Both the lotus root salad and the tofu were a little less memorable. The lotus salad was delicious, but I would have enjoyed more fungus and a little less sauce. Tofu was good, but some of characterized by heat, which could have been offset with a bit more vinegar.

Overall great experience. It's a very long drive from the city, but we will definitely go back. Next time, we'll bring a group so that we can sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"One of the better peking duck places in the GTA, as their chef had worked in the famous Quan Ju De in Beijing.  Duck is served in the traditional Beijing style (first a few pieces of skin served with sugar sprinkles) followed by rest of duck in wrappers.  Their wrappers were thin yet held its structure well when wrapped and I was able to eat more duck rolls without feeling full too quickly like other restaurants.  Their fried rice was a bit lacking, but the fried duck hearts was nicely done.  They ran out of the malt beer on tap, so we ended up having the regular lager type beer which was a bit watered down (good for chugging).  Overall a decent duck and other Beijing regional dishes place, will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Yeahhhhhhhh Peking duck!
Came here today to try out their Peking roasted duck. 
I came with some people from beijing, they said the duck here are quite authentic, however the sauce could be better. 

A small plate of duck skin was brought to us first, they were quickly devoured by used thin a minute. The skin were sprinkled with some sugar on top, they were very crispy and creamy, soooo fatty. Then the full plate of roasted duck skin and meat are served, placed on top of a lit candle to be kept warm. Two plates of thin steamed pancakes, and threaded scallion, cucumbers and some sweet bean sauce were provided. The way to eat these is to place one piece of pancake on your hand, put some scallion, cucumber, duck and some sauce on top of the pancake, then roll it up like spring roll and eat it with your hand. Yum~  

Since only the skin and top layer of the meat were served, there are still a some meat left on the duck rack/bone. These can be taken home with you, they are great for broth or congee. The other option is to ask the chef to stir fry the remaining duck with either cumin seed, hot chili or pepper. We had it cooked with cumin seed. Tasted amazing! Flavorful finger food. These stir fried duck rack would be great to be paired with beer. They were quite greasy tho, ducks are usually quite fat. Anyway, no food is wasted!

We also had 3 other dishes, some garlic stir fried green veggie, braised eel and some stir fried chili and pork. 

The food were great, but very greasy I have to say. The restaurant is relatively new, so it was very clean with nice decor. Friendly  and attentive staff. I would recommend Peking Duck Kitchen, and will definitely come back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Don't mind the few reviews this place has, this place is absolutely AMAZING! 

I consider myself to be kind of a Peking duck expert of the Toronto area. I been to almost if not all the Peking duck restaurants located in the GTA, but let me tell you this place has one of the best tasting ducks outside of China.

This duck here has very thin and crispy skin, the wraps here are the thinnest I had in the GTA, and the fat has been taken care of very well. 

If you're in the area or if you have time and love Peking duck, definitely come check this place out. You won't regret it.

Just a tip. Call ahead to reserve the duck so you don't have to wait forever for the duck to be served."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant because my father-in-law wants to rat Peking duck. In fact, this is not a big restaurant. Gave this restaurant a call before coming and we were told that they had a full house.
But they are so nice to give us a call when there's a table available.

\"A\" Choy with Garlic (score 5/5)
Although it is an ordinary dish, the garlic flavour is well spread throughout the vegetables, \"A\" choy. The \"A\" choy tastes fresh and delicious in its broth.

Shrimps with Vegetables (score 4.5/5)
There are many shrimps on the plate with carrots and cucumbers chunks. In general, the dish tastes good but I feel that the texture of the shrimps is not \"elastic\"or not chewy enough. 

Peking Duck (score 5/5)
It is Sooooooo Goooood!!! The wrap is sooooo thin! The skin of the duck is so crisp and the meat is well marinated.

Lettuce Wrap (score 4.5/5)
They gave us the whole lettuce which most of the restaurants will not do that! The meat is a bit  spicy to my personal taste but it's still good 

I will definitely come back again with my family and friends."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at this restaurant. I can state that their Peking Duck is as good as we had in Hong Kong and Bejing. An excellent restaurant with an open kitchen.Service is friendly and their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The Beijing Duck here is excellent. It's good enough for any major Chinese city in China. We ordered several items off the regular menu also. The fish fillet was especially good. Other items were decent also. 

I was traveling from US. This was almost worth the trip by itself."}
{"text":"My favourite this time around in the Markham area.  Great choice after a full course seafood dinner the night before.  As other reviewer indicated the duck slice is one of the best in Canada.  I can't recall if the famous Hong Kong Peking Garden were as thinly sliced as this place.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Legit Peking Duck. I travel to Beijing for work frequently, and every trip includes a peking duck dinner. This restaurant lives up to its name - very comparable to some of the best ducks I've had in the mainland. 

What we ate: 

Peaking duck wrap combo, includes: 
- 2 steamers of flour wraps ~12 wraps per steamer! Made perfectly moist and thin, just like they make it in Beijing
-duck neck skin/fat crisped to perfection, dipped in sugar as an appetizer before the main meal
- plate full of duck meat/skin for the wraps - skin was again perfectly crisped, duck was meaty, not too fatty, pieces were sliced thin enough to put into the wrap, but also thick enough to maintain the natural juices and favor of the meat
- cucumber strips
- leek strips
- hoisin sauce

Xiao long bao: ordered 3 steamers of this ~6/steamer - meat/dumpling skin was proportion. Skins were made fresh in the kitchen and delightfully filled with savory soup. 

Wah Wah Choy: giant platter of leafy vegetables served with or without the soup base. We got ours with the soup. Tasted like squash soup? Vegetables were fresh, no complaints. 

Spicy beef slices: this is a cold appetizer of cooked beef slices marinated in hot chilly sauce. Huge portion size. 

Overall the food here is fantastic and service was on point. My family has come here about 4 times now, food has been relatively consistent in quality. Admittedly service is not on par during the busy weekend rush. 

I highly recommend this place, but come on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
Midland/Sheppard intersection, it's in a small plaza east of Midland, on Sheppard. Restaurant is by the corner of that plaza strip. Limited parking available, but there's other plaza where you can park and walk over. Interior is your typical Chinese restaurant, there is a big window where you can see the staff working in the kitchen. Groups of table available, so perfect for groups. Service was okay, we spoke mostly in Cantonese/Mandarin, but it does seem like they can speak English as well.

Food
Obviously ordered the peking duck since it's known for it. I like how the duck was not too oily. The meat itself was chewy, complimenting well with the celery, oyster sauce. Also, the wrap was very thin - which is very important because a thick wrap ruins the taste and the overall experience. Portion size was well enough to serve 10 people at around $50 - really worth the buck.

Ordered other dishes (which unfortunately didn't catch the name) were overall okay. 
The eggplant related one was a little too saucy and salty to my tasting.
The duck with yolk in the middle is a good recommendation!

I think coming in here as a group is worth to try - if you're into Chinese and duck related cuisine. Overall it's not a bad experience, I wouldn't mind coming back for the peking duck again."}
{"text":"Pretty good and reasonable price for Peking duck that will feed a large group. Having ordered the Peking duck set, we were pleased to find that the Peking duck was flavourful and had an abundance fo crispy skin. I was happy to find that the wraps that were to accompany the Peking duck were fluffy and didn't have an overwhelmingly floury and dense taste. The mix that was to go into the lettuce wraps was a little salty, but had good flavours nonetheless, with vegetables mixed in to improve the texture. We also ordered a pig's blood stew, which was quite interesting but worth trying. The pig's blood was salty and mixed with chili peppers for a slightly spicy dish; it was complimented with chunks of spam and other vegetables within. Overall, pretty good for Peking duck and other samples of northern Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Checked our this place on a Sunday evening with a party of five.  The place was full, but fortunately we had reservations!

Of course, bring at a restaurant called Peking Duck, we had to order Peking Duck!  The duck was good, nothing too write home about, BUT the skin used to wrap the Peking Duck was unreal. I have never had anything that thin before. It was amazing! Along with the duck, we also had the lettuce wrap and sauteed duck bones.  The lettuce wrap was flavorful and spicy, small portion though compared to other restaurants.  The sauteed duck bones was good but you can definitely taste the MSG.  We also ordered a few other dishes that were nothing special.  Like many Asian restaurants in the GTA, they serve Amber Lager, a local beer brewed in Markham and it's dirt cheap!  We got one of those pour yourself gadgets with 1.5L of beer and it was only$11!  In total, including tips, our total was $150. Amazing value for the amount of food we got for 5 people.

Service wise, they were short staffed and kept forgetting requests from us.  They were very hardworking though!

To end, good food, great value, average service."}
{"text":"Went with friends and we ordered combo 1 (wraps with salt+pepper bone stir fry) and combo 2 (lettuce wrap + cumin stir fry).  Enjoyed the duck as Beijing style Peking duck's skin is crispier and less fatty than HK style Peking duck.

Something to be mindful of is that combo 2 (lettuce wrap), the mince duck is a tad spicy.  

Table was unanimous is enjoying the cumin duck bone stir fry a tad more than the salt+pepper."}
{"text":"Cute little Chinese restaurant with a window where you can watch the chefs prepare the duck. 

Liked:
-Peking duck (I liked how the wraps were thinner. If you prefer thick wraps this is not the place for you). 
-eggs and tomato dish 

Disliked:
-melon and rib soup (had a very strong weird meat smell) 
-bean curd and snow fungus cold dish (I thought the vinegar taste was a bit strong and the bean curd was really hard..)


Overall it was okay but I probably won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat Peking duck but this restaurant food is really good. Besides the duck, other dishes is very good too. The service is very good also. It's not very expensive like big Peking duck restaurant. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Yelp came through this time! This duck isn't cheap, but it does stand out in a good way. The wrappers are super thin without breaking on us. The duck skin with sugar on top that came before the actual Peking duck skin and wraps came was phenomenal. It was super crispy and the sugar on top made it amazing. They have a salted duck egg rolled in duck meat roll that's very unique. It's also rather eye-catching. For the portion, the price is not bad. I forget how much now. I thought it'd be on the salty side. Surprisingly, it wasn't. Grandpa loved the lettuce wraps we got as the 2nd course for our duck. They seasoned the duck meat so it was rather spicy. He said it wasn't but he was sweating. His mouth couldn't feel the heat but his body could. We had a lot of duck that night. They also had some spicy duck appetizer which was a roasted duck leg in mala sauce which was tasty, but numbing, as mala should be. Oh. And we got the duck bones of our duck cumin style. I really like cumin. The rest of the family not so much.

We rather enjoyed our time here, but a few things soured our experience a little. There was a drunk man who was raging because the owner refused to sell him more alcohol. He came in drunk and railed for a bit, then left, then came back in a railed for a bit, etc. While I was watching them prepare the ducks (they have a window where you can see them slice the ducks, roast the ducks, etc), they removed a duck for someone and another one of the ducks fell on the floor and they put it back in the oven. My family saw it and demanded that the waiters tell the chef that we wouldn't be having the duck that we saw fall on the floor. When the waiter told the chef, he took the dirty duck out of the oven and put it aside. It would have been much more comforting had he done that before we said we saw it happen. We also got 2 orders of wraps. We thought 2 orders came with the duck because we hadn't ordered extra. After we had started eating that 2nd order, we were told that only one was supposed to come with our duck. Um...okay. What would you like us to do about it now?

All in all, still a pleasant experience enough that my parents wanted a VIP card which they do not have. Sad."}
{"text":"Update: they changed the ingredients in my favorite dish, ?????? they used to have sliced duck breast,  boneless duck feet, and heart. We ordered takeout in Saturday and ended up with 80% duck livers and some gizzards. Very disappointed! So I am deducting one star from my previous review! 

Better than QJD (where the duck we got was cold) and better dining in. Closes on Tuesdays and packed during \"regular meal time\" and weekend. We went back 4 times within 2 weeks my son loves their duck & duck wraps so much the the can eat more than half of it. We ordered a couple of times of takeout, better dine in so the duck skin stays crunchy.

Beef wraps (pancake with spring onions) are nice. We like to dip them in the black vinegar.

Other speciality dishes with duck meat/organs are nice, 

the rest dishes are average (but with the taste of \"home\" so I am happy with it).

But Green Salad doesn't worth he money don't order it...and Deep fried shrimps in Salted egg yolk was not what I was looking for (too much bread crumbs not enough egg yolk) so not recommended."}
{"text":"We took my friend's peking duck virginity. Ok, that actually felt weird to type out, but it's how she wanted to describe this outing to have peking duck. 

She wanted something that was not QJD expensive and we were struggling at one point. This place was close enough to our pre-duck outing at Scarborough Bluffs (NB: they have fenced off the area where everyone's taking the cool af pics but also being stupid). Located in the plaza next to Fisherman Villa and across from the One2Snacks plaza at Midland/Sheppard, we were greeted upon entering. We were seated and realized most of the wait staff here don't speak English, some understand Cantonese and speak Mandarin. Service was how you expect it at a Chinese restaurant - fast, yet curt. 

The peking duck is the highlight of the meal, everything else we ordered was over salted and ruined my meal :( They have a window for you to watch the chefs prep the duck pre-roast, and ever so meticulously slice the skin. We ordered the single duck combo along with a few extra dishes - spicy pork, green beans stir fried with pork, and a fried rice. The duck was served with side dishes of:
julienned green onion, cucumbers cut length-wide, thin pancake wraps, hoisin sauce. I will say that this is one of the better peking ducks I've had as there was a good ratio of meat, fat and skin, which was as far from chewy as possible. They don't make the dish with the remaining bones as you need minimum 2 orders of duck to do so.

What I dislike about this place is that they use a single tea bag for the pot of tea...like how you gonna get tea flavour after twice steeping it in a 550mL teapot? 

They accept card (no Amex I assume) and cash/debit. 
May be back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this Peking duck place. Peking duck potion was small compared to other restaurants I've been too. Doesn't seems like they gave us a full duck. The duck was good and your dishes like dumplings, pancake is just same as any other place. To be honest this place is overpriced for everything and small portion where I can get better quality of food and bigger plates at another place."}
{"text":"Colour, aroma and taste of the food in this restaurant are all Perfect!!

Lettuce Wrap
I was served generously with a whole lettuce. The meat that is wrapped in the lettuce is well marinated and sauce  is not needed to put in the wrap to enrich the taste. 

Peking Duck
The wrap is super thin. It takes certain craftsmanship to make this type of quality wrap. Duck skin is very crispy with good amount of meat with eachUsually this kind of dish will have a lot of fat between the skin of the duck and it's meat but this is not the case. Everything is well balanced and tastes perfect.

\"A\" Choy with Garlic
The garlic aroma and flavour is well covered the dish. The vegetable tastes so good with the garlic.

Shrimps with Assorted Vegetables 
A lot of shrimps on the dish with chunks of carrot and cucumber. Taste awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday.Ordered stew eggplant, chilli chicken, cashew chicken, beef wrap,duck rolls, and egg fried rice. Chilli chicken was too dried and the eggplant was too salty.  Service was really good and in comparison to other Chinese places, I consider this one really good.
Price for everything was $80 (I guess that's average)."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, my friends and I, all seasoned F&B professionals, were impressed with the food. I came back tonight with a group of ten, including two friends who were celebrating birthdays.

Of course, we ordered the Peking Duck, duck soup, hot & sour soup, beef pancake roll, kung pao chicken, ma po tofu, and a few other dishes.

The duck arrived first, followed closely by the beef pancake roll and duck soup. The duck seemed smaller than I remember and we got half the number of pancakes but it tasted good. The duck broth wasn't as rich as the last time but still good. The beef was good. Unfortunately, all the rest of the dishes were misses, with some of them borderline inedible.

The next dish, kung pao chicken, which we have never ordered before, from anywhere, had a floral spice that made our tongues feel numb and tingly at the same time. We learned that this spice is mala peppercorns, or Sichuan pepper. The dish was laced with it. Way too much! The floral flavour was overpowering (for all of us) and the tingling numb sensation was very offputting. Very! I cannot describe this sensation as pleasant.

The rest of the dishes were not any better. The chef tonight was very heavy handed with the mala peppercorns, soya sauce, and chili oil. Whether or not they all had mala peppercorns, that's all we could taste, even now, hours later. Not good!

The hot & sour soup was very dark and thick. The ma po tofu was swimming in chili oil and smothered in peppercorns. We barely touched it. Other dishes included the second course of the Peking duck, shrimps, and vegetables. We couldn't finish it and declined to take it home.

It's hard, even for me, to believe that my opinion of this place could change so drastically. To top it all off, we were asked to leave so another group could take our table.

Sorry for ruining your birthday celebrations, my friends."}
{"text":"It is 4 stars.

This review is done mostly based on the commentaries of a senior couple.  They love eating Peking ducks.  They have eaten numerous Peking ducks in their long lives (they are in their 80's) in Toronto and in China.  Their opinions on Peking ducks are the most trustworthy among my personal friends.  They said the Peking ducks were good here.  Their comments are as follows: 
1) The skin slices were the thinnest they have had in Toronto
2) There was next to no fat on the skin slices
3) The flour wraps were very thin yet they didn't break
4) The sauces were good

The one star deduction was based on my opinions:
1) The meat was bland.  If not for the sauces, the meat slices had no flavour
2) The pricing model charges extra for additional green onions and sauces.  While it is customary to charge extra for additional wraps, most restaurants in Toronto don't charge extra for sauces and green onions.  Peking duck is a dish that has sufficient profit margin to provide these."}
{"text":"Best. Peking. Duck. Ever. 
Very crispy, very melt in your mouth goodness! I have never had melt in your mouth crispy Peking duck before and I have had lots of Peking duck! I especially liked the little tea candle getup like they do for special afternoon tea to keep your tea pot warm. 
Simply delicious! Can't wait to come back to try out some of the other dishes! T was only two of us, so we ordered the two course Peking duck set and a stir fried veggies. 
My only complain was we had specifically asked for no spicy in the 2nd course of the lettuce wrap and it came out soicy!"}
{"text":"Peking Duck Kitchen obviously is famous for Peking Duck. It makes me wanna try this place is because their other dishes are above average based on the Yelpers' reviews. 

Service is very friendly; I agree with other reviewers that the staff showed their eagerness to please customers. The service was efficient. 

We ordered Peking duck two-way (indeed there were 4 dishes) and added $4.99 for the duck bone soup. I was surprised the soup came sort of immediately. The soup was the only disappointment of the whole night. I would not pay extra for the soup or should try other ways to cook the bone. 

I could see the chef was shredding the duck skin from the \"open concept\" kitchen window. The duck was freshly made and I could see steam coming out from the duck. First dish was a few pieces of duck skin from the fattest part of the duck with sugar. It was crispy and sort of \"melt in your mouth\". It was very delicious. 

The second dish was the duck skin and meat for the flour wraps. I love the duck was not overly fat and the skin was very crispy. The flour wrap was very thin to give you full enjoyment of the duck itself. 

The third dish was stir fry duck meat with veggies with lettuce wraps. At first I saw the portion was smaller than I had in other places. Yet we ended up couldn't finish all the meat with the lettuce provided. 

We also ordered Dry stir fried pork intestine and Shrimp with Baby Cabbage based on my fellow Yelper Jennifer K's recommendations. 

I am big fan of spicy food and pork intestines. This dish was very delicious. However, it was very spicy and you have to make sure you can bear that hotness. The pork intestine portion was generous and I enjoyed every bite of it. 

Shrimp with Baby Cabbage was a big surprise. The dish was gigantic; the presentation was like a piece of art. The pumpkin soup was delicious with Baby Cabbage. 

I think other than the duck bone soup was a regret; I enjoy the meal very much! I will definitely go back for more Peking duck!!"}
{"text":"Peking Duck Kitchen is really good if you want good food and good price.
We (my wife and I)had: duck wrap, fried rice with beef, country style pork and shrimp. It all cane up to 45 dollars.

Portion : 8/10- the portion will satisfy the average person. 
Quality: 8/10 - food was very good very juicy.  Lost 2 points as there was some fat in the pork.
Price: 9/10 - you pay for what you get and for 45.00 this was worth it!

If you're on a budget and want Good Chinese food. Go to Peking Duck Kitchen."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Peking Duck Kitchen serves really good Peking Duck ($40+)! Since every duck is roasted when ordered, it did take awhile for it to be ready. But the wait is totally worth it!! 

We opted for ???? Two Style Roasted Duck ($48.99) Duck skin was so crispy and light!! They even serves some with sprinkles of white sugar. I just ate those like chips and they were so good: sweet and savory the same time! The meat was soft and has good duck meat flavour. 

You might need to order extra wrappings. Those wrappings were good (thin and soft), additional cost $3.90/10. All condiments are extra charges if you want to order more. 

Aside from their Signature Peking Duck, the other dish we ordered were tasty and had really good presentation! I did not expect from a small neighbourhood restaurant. ????? Dry Shrimps Baby Cabbage ($ 8.99)

Peking Duck Kitchen probably one of the best options for duck in this area. I think I would be back for more!

Pro Tip: order some cold dish to start as it did take over 20 min for the duck to arrive. Highly recommend the spicy pig stomach!"}
{"text":"For $39.99 you can get a peking duck.  And it was good.  And also the other dish i would recommend is the steamed fish.  That was delicious.  But other than that, i've had better in many restaurants.  
For a chinese restaurant though, what struck me the most was the tea served.  They used a tea bag instead of tea leaves.  So after repeated refilling, the tea just tasted gross.
Service was meh.  It took them a long time to refill tea.  When we asked for new sets of CLEAN chopsticks,  they came back with those disposable ones instead of the regular ones.  
The quest for a good peking duck restaurant continues."}
