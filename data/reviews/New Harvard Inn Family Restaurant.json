{"text":"Old fashioned \"greasy spoon\" -type restaurant with decent food at very decent prices. Employees are good people. I've had the breakfast, and the burgers and fries. All good, and the prices can't be beat."}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I have lived in the neighborhood for over a year, and heard good things about this restaurant.  So, on a recent Sunday afternoon we decided to walk over for lunch.

The decor is very bland, but who really cares as long as it's clean and the food is good, right?  It's the type of restaurant where you seat yourself, and there are a lot of regulars.

At first, our waitress seemed somewhat rude (looking around when taking our drink order/not being friendly when announcing specials,) but she seemed to warm up once she realized we were polite and only there to enjoy a good lunch before going bicycling.

I ordered the cheese omlette with hash browns and wheat toast.  My boyfriend ordered the pierogies, which came with a salad (lettuce, dressing and tomatos,) roll and free dessert (strawberry cheesecake.)  The roll and salad were brought out very quickly, and both were good.  After about 10 minutes our food arrived, and it was delicious.  The omlette was huge, with a ton of cheese.  The hash browns were delicious and plentiful.  I sneaked a piece of my boyfriend's lunch and it was delicious as well.  The pierogies were filled with potato, and had a ton of sauteed onions covering them.  They *were* a bit greasy, but still very yummy.  The cheesecake was delicious as well, and I'd swear it was homemade.

The best part, though, was the bill.  Lunch for both of us, including two sodas, was $13.  We both started laughing when we saw how inexpensive the food was!  Even with a $6 tip, we were full of yummy food for less than $20.

The only downsides are the hours (they close at 4PM) and parking would probably be difficult during busy times (we walked over so it wasn't an issue.)  Overall, though, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Divey little restaurant that advertises ethnic food. The only ethnic is the pierogis but they're cheese only and fried so that cancels that. They feature an extensive breakfast menu with three egg omelettes, Texas toast, breakfasts under 5 bucks. Everyone knows each other in here. Mix of young, old, black, white, factory rats and folks in suits. Reasonably clean but horrid decor. Food is so so. Waitress will coach you through your order  in a whispy cigarette voice, remove your plates faster than you can say, \"I'm not finished\" and lay the bill on the table while your left pondering listening to Foreigner on the radio. Go down to Fleet Street to Seven Roses or Red Apple..."}
