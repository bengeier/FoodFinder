{"text":"FOOD: I found myself asking where's the goat?  My goat curry was nothing but bones, far and cartilage. The taste of the curry sauce was ok.  The curry sauce was not as thick as I like.  They also added the twigs of the thyme rather than just the leaves and ackee fruit to the curry.  I by far prefer West Indian curry from Trinidadian or Guyanese establishments.    PORTION SIZE: Very small in comparison to the price paid.  Definitely not worth it.    LOCATION: The location is an overcrowded food court on the campus of York University.    SERVICE: Ok.  No complaints.    COST: Not worth the price.  Best curry in the area is in the Jane-Finch Mall."}
{"text":"Good food for decent price.  The $4.99 special is worth the money but not gourmet food.  I like having more peas in my rice and peas but it's mostly rice.  The chicken is good but maybe a bit oily.   Haven't tried much on the menu but would come here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat on campus, by far. I've tried nearly every other place at York but nothing comes close.  The food is amazing and very filling (I usually get the jerk chicken or curry goat), the prices can't be beat and the staff is very friendly. If you're looking for something delicious to eat at York try The Islands! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for lunch if I didn't make my own. It's delicious, filling, and doesn't break the bank. The chicken special comes with rice & peas or white rice, coleslaw or salad, and your choice of Jerk, BBQ or Fried chicken. They always give you three pieces of chicken. You can also choose to have a little curry on your rice. All for $5.50 and quite a decent amount of food, for my anyway. You can always do add-ons of plantains, festival or patties. The only thing that's tough during the school year is the line up. Man does it move at a crawl! But honestly I find it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering Jamaican cuisine.. I'd say it's the best I've ever tasted-- I recently found out they cater and have taken advantage of this a few times for social events I've hosted. Highly recommend for any occasion. Your guests will be amazed."}
{"text":"This place has a $5 lunch special that has been a great balance between the wallet and stomach. The special includes a choice of jerk or fried chicken (usually they give you 3pcs), rice or rice with peas, coleslaw and gravy. Also, the service is quick and efficient, so don't get intimidated by the long lines that you see here!"}
{"text":"Location: York University (Student Center) Service: Decent Price: $$  This business has been open for a few years (approximately 2?). They have a lunch special until 3pm everyday and it is $6 (including tax). The portions for the lunch special is smaller but you do get a lot of food. The lunch special consist of rice (either plain or beans with rice), chicken (jerk, BBQ or fried), and salad or coleslaw. This is a good place to eat on Keele campus and the price is decent. I believe that their chicken is halal so that's a bonus for those who are looking for halal options on campus. But you should double check before ordering. The only down side to them is the rice, some days their rice is really good while other days its a little to soggy.   Verdict: Fan"}
{"text":"Lunch special Monday to Friday from 10:30am to 3:00pm. I recommend the vegetarian option as its cheaper, tastier, and more filling. Good portions. Service is quick and friendly. Overall tasty food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I stopped by York one day and noticed this new place had opened up. It was my first time trying oxtail and I'm so glad I did. It was not what I expected and now I'm kicking myself for not trying it sooner. I'm pretty jealous of all the Yorkies that get to enjoy this on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Solid Caribbean food place which has been in business since 2012.   The price for lunch special has gone up quite a bit but I understand since  price for the ingredients has gone up as well and they need to make ends meet to stay in business. The taste never disappoints and service has always been good.   Their jerk chicken is really spicy. I cannot eat spicy food for personal reason so I usually go for their BBQ chicken. Very tender and juicy.  This place is, in my opinion, the best eatery (fast food) at York."}
{"text":"At York U, when you're looking for a satisfying meal that doesn't break the bank, there aren't many options. Thankfully, The Islands offers an affordable (~$5.50) chicken, rice and salad lunch special until 3 PM everyday. You can choose between three pieces of jerk, fried or barbecue chicken, white rice or rice and peas, and green salad or coleslaw. My favourite combination is jerk chicken, rice and peas and coleslaw - from what I've observed, this is the combination of choice for most students. They actually pack quite a bit of food into the small containers. It might look like a snack portion, but it's always filled me up until dinnertime.   This might sound odd considering my review is based on this restaurant's chicken, but I really don't like chicken. I particularly don't enjoy the taste of dark meat. Somehow, The Islands has managed to make chicken tolerable for me, to the point that I actually crave the jerk chicken from this place. It's usually quite spicy, moist and not overpowering like dark meat can be. I have gotten chicken that was a bit too moist, which grossed me out, but this has only happened twice after eating the jerk chicken on a weekly basis for three semesters, so I can't really take stars away for that.  The coleslaw is awesome. I don't have any other words to describe it. It's perfect, and just the way coleslaw should be. My favourite thing to do is mix it with the rice and peas to give the rice extra flavour.   I've also had the goat and the oxtail and both were pretty good, but not worth the double digit price. The oxtail definitely isn't for someone planning to eat on-the-go because it takes two hands to pick at those bones...and the huge amount of bones means there's not too much meat for the price. If the chicken lunch special is available, take that instead of their regular priced items.   The only thing that I don't like about The Islands is the inconsistent service. Some of the employees are really friendly and don't refrain from making small talk. Others (especially the lady who puts the chicken into the container during lunch!) never seem to crack a smile and make it seem like the customers are inconveniencing them by ordering their food. Another thing that really bothers me when ordering the chicken is the way that the lady picks at the pieces of chicken before putting them in the container. She'll pick one up, look at it, then put it back down to choose another one. Shouldn't they all be the same? I don't know if she tries to save the good pieces for her favourite customers or something, but it's weird. But hey, just like the Wendy's a few spots to the left, the service isn't bad enough to keep me away from the food."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm the first reviewer for this place. It's family run, cheap-as-hell, right outside of York University, has huge portions, vegan/veggie options, incredible selections of Caribbean dishes for the omnivores, and doubles the size of cheeseburgers.   Largest size of roti is under $6, will be more than sufficient to fill you up and they now offer pumpkin inside the curried potato roti. The doubles filling is great, and their pepper sauce that they use for the roti and doubles is the perfect scotch bonnet spice to complement the curry. Pre-veg, I also experienced the curry chicken, jerk chicken and shrimp rotis - and they were awesome. Turnaround is fast enough for a York student to grab take-out between classes.   At this point, the family that runs this place probably thinks I don't have my own kitchen. If you're as stoked on roti as I am, you should check this place out. Totally underrated."}
{"text":"The Islands is a Caribbean fast food joint located in the Student Centre at York University. It's only been on campus for 1.5 years now and it's already my favourite place to eat when I'm at school. They have great lunch specials - Chicken + Rice for $5, Chicken + Festival (basically fried dough) for $4. The latter special is my favourite and I have it often.   The specials come in the smaller take-out container, but they pack that container up, specially for the chicken + rice special. It comes with chicken in one of three styles (jerk, BBQ, fried) - I prefer the jerk the most. I can't comment too much regarding authenticity but the sauces they use are delicious. The rice and peas they offer tastes great, especially once the sauce from the chicken starts to settle in... mmm.   The only drawback with regards to the chicken is that they don't usually give you the meatiest portions, resulting in you having to work for whatever you get. This isn't much of a problem though as the food just tastes so good.  If you're a student at York University, definitely try The Islands ASAP. I assure that it's one of your better options."}
{"text":"great cheap eats lunch specials up until 3pm ($3.99).  love the jerk/curry/fried chicken, channa (stewed chickpeas), plantain and rice&peas.  also offer stewed chicken & oxtail... maybe goat. they used to have good roti but unfortunately, it's no longer available. large portions. love it here"}
{"text":"It took me a while to peel away from Dirty Bird next door, but the amazing reviews this place has everywhere - Yelp, Google, Facebook - convinced me to give it a shot (it not being a chain was a major factor too)  Rest assured, it was worth the risk. I got the Jerk Chicken lunch special for $7 and change. While the box looked small at first, I found that it was absolutely packed with a luxurious serving of 4 pieces of chicken on Rice & Peas and coleslaw. And all of the components were cooked the way they should be. The Rice & Peas were a bit dry, but were cooked well, mushy with a little bite to them. The chicken was well seasoned, and cooked to a point where the skin had become papery and crisp under the spicing. The coleslaw had that crunch that tells you it is fresh, and had the cooling effect you need to balance the Jerk spice.  While I will probably end up with Chicken and Waffles the next time I am up at York, it will not be long until I am eating at Islands again!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area visiting, and figured to make a quick stop in for a bite. A quick search on yelp pointed me to the local food court and this restaurant.  Fighting through the crowd of people, I was finally able to place an order. A bit short staffed, so the wait for my food took a bit longer than expected, but nothing too crazy.  Upon first look, I was ready to be met with a resounding taste of \"meh\" given the location of this restaurant (university campus) and the look of the food. But after the first bite, I was hooked and found myself going mm mm 'm.  The rice was good, with beans mixed in, topped with some chicken gravy sauce. There was 4 pieces of chicken, and a scoop of cole slaw on the side. The cole slaw was crispy and fresh, not soggy, but didn't seem very flavorful, quite possibly overpowered by the other flavors in the dish.  The chicken was quite tasty, moist, fall off the bone and had a very nice spicy kick which I wasn't expecting.  The faster you eat, the spicier it gets, but if you pace yourself the spiciness level is tolerable.   Overall, for university campus food I was quite pleasantly surprised at how tasty the jerk chicken was.  Would definitely stop in again to try other dishes when in the area."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place! This is a new jamaican restaurant they added to the food court this year, I could not be happier. Everyday between 10-3 they have a daily lunch special and I always make it just in time to get my fix. Every time I come I order the same thing, jerk chicken, because it taste so good and never disappoints. You can tell they marinate their meat because I literally suck all the flavour out of the bone. Thank you for coming to york and I look forward to trying the rest of your menu!"}
{"text":"The chicken lunch special is great - only until 2:30pm though. I like getting the BBQ chicken with rice and peas (no gravy, it's quite salty in my opinion) and some slaw (love the slaw!). The jerk chicken is good, but it's too spicy for me. If you can handle the heat then definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Islands 30+ times since I started working at York University in February. That should give you a sense of the way that The Islands stands head and shoulders above everything else offered on campus.  York Lanes is stuffed with places offering $10 lunch plates and fast food franchises that refuse to honor chain-wide deals (looking at you, Wendy's and Popeye's). The Islands, by contrast, offers nice, filling food for a very reasonable price. The lunch special (3 pieces of BBQ/Fried/Jerk Chicken + Salad + Rice) is $6 after taxes, which is phenomenal value for York. The only other reasonable lunches that come in under $7 are two value menu items from Wendy's, a slice of pizza from Gino's, or the daily wrap deal at Falafel Hut. Even the small dinners come in under $9, though you'll only get one extra piece of chicken and a bit more rice and salad. The $6 special is filling, tasty, and cheap. I'm tempted to give The Islands 5 stars, but it's not quite amazing - it's really just like having an Island Foods on campus. Which is still pretty great.  I've become a bit of an expert on the different varieties of Lunch Special offered here:  BBQ Chicken is my go-to, as usual for Caribbean restaurants. The sauce is nice and sweet and the chicken is cooked very well. From time to time you might get a charred or blackened piece, which will suck. The sweetness of the chicken goes very well with rice and peas.  The Fried Chicken is really great too, especially if you manage to get it fresh. The breading is always very crispy and there's a nice spiciness to it. It's just as well-cooked as the BBQ. It doesn't go as well with the rice, but it's so delicious that it doesn't really matter. Your 3 piece at The Islands is probably half the price of what you'll pay at the no-deal York Popeye's.  Jerk chicken also seems quite good, but it's not my favorite. It's definitely got a lot of jerk spice, which gives it a heavy, meaty, savory taste. It has some real heat to it as well. I'm pretty sure that this is a very good jerk chicken, but I'll always prefer BBQ or Fried.  Generally you'll get 1 or 2 thigh pieces and 1 or 2 drumsticks, though I have gotten three thighs (the dream) and three legs (the nightmare). Going there pretty much every day doesn't seem to make the counter worker inclined to give you better chicken pieces - it's really just the luck of the draw. I shouldn't have to tell you that you should always get rice and peas over white rice (free flavour and protein) and salad over coleslaw (coleslaw is terrible).  So if you're looking for lunch at York, you should definitely check out The Islands - it's easily the best restaurant on campus."}
