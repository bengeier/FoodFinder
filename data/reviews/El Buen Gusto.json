{"text":"El servicio de este lugar esta muy malo por eso les doy 1 estrella porque lo unico que me gusto fue el agua de tamarindo"}
{"text":"High prices, bad neighbourhood. Food tastes good. But with the money i spent, could of want to the buffet instead...."}
{"text":"Worse place ever.. ordered a breakfast plate.. the platines where cold the Pupusa hard as a rock oh and I think the beans where straight from the can. Oh and last time I check atol de elote is supposed to be thick and not soup in a cup."}
{"text":"I call and placed an order of pupusas and Guatemalan tamales, my friend went to pick them up. Bad experience, the tamales where not Guatemalan, no flavor at all and the pupusas where also not good, and the size of a quarter, very small, not good at all,.      I,m not going back!!  The prices are very high!!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I found a spot. I'm salvadoran so I believe I know what a pupusas should taste. I'm also a foodie. I just happen to see this place during our marine corps ball visit. What caught my eye was that it said that it had a mexican, guatemalan,  salvadoran menu.  I had the mariscos soup and pupusas with Atole de elote to drink. It all taste like I was at home in my Abuelas house in El Salvador or in Guatemala. Friendly staff. They are slow but not their fault. This isn't fast food.  Also my favorite handmade tortillas Central American style. You can't complain about that. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"So to understand my mindset, I started the day with a 3 mile run with Fleet Feet Fort Mill, a 1 hour bootcamp ABV, roasting Forte Legato Coffee's new Cameroon crop for an hour, then 1.5 hours of rolling at Great Grappling Jiu Jitsu. Only having sports drinks and water all day, I had a HANKERING For Salvadorian.   We typically go up to east Charlotte for our fix, but we're excited to find out that this place still existed after Plaza Fiesta in Fort Mill was taken down before Cabelas went up.   Onto the food: 1: Pupusa revuelta - let me tell you about the excitement when I heard the patting and forming of the tortillas for the pork, beans and cheese which would be encased in these. Not only was the size a bit bigger than what I've been accustomed to but the price was also amazing. Needless to say the standard cabbage mix and red sauce came with it, tomato flavor balancing the salted pork, beans and cheese perfectly.  2: Pupusa loca - this giant Pupusa has 'everything' even some noticeable vegetable matter like carrots. It's a must. I could only eat half in order to save room for half of the revuelta. 3: Burrito de Asada - taking a bite of this Burrito, which is not a giant but still a good portion, the combination of steak, rice, beans, lettuce, Tomato, cucumber and salsa did not even need any of that additional queso that you might add at Americanized burrito places. Popping flavor with strange Uncle Ben rice quality though.  4: Pollo encebollado (roughly translates to 'baked chicken with some lemony mustardy awesomeness) This baked chicken had some sort of Citrus marinade while there were some onions on top with a mustard sauce. Put that on top of the 'Uncle Ben' rice with some veggies on the side and two tortillas and honestly I was completely amazed at how the onions and mustard complimented each other and played with the chicken. Chicken was semi-dry at parts and rice quality still sub-standard. (I do eat a lot of rice though so I'm picky)  Horchata- Rice milk with cinnamon goodness BEST HORCHATA IN THE CAROLINAS. So smooth, no weird clumps or aftertaste. YES!  If I were to gauge score this solely on the pupusas and horchata, this is 5 stars! Honestly no need to get anything else as I could only eat the two halves of the pupusas, a couple bites of the burrito and chicken and I was full. As a person from the Bay Area, I'd say this rivals the Salvadorian food there and gets my stamp of approval. The woman who made the pupusas for me was the friendliest and they made it feel like home. I'll frequent this place and continue down the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, sketchy area, but other than that the customer service could be better. I recommend calling ahead if it's to go, takes a while."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the food authentic but the atmosphere makes your day better! After discovering this place and trying many many all over town this place by far has the best El Salvadoran food."}
{"text":"The owners & staff stand head and shoulders above other similar restaurants in town. Their food is awesome and very authentic. They catered a party of 50 for us and were very professional from start to finish. Thank you El Buen Gusto."}
{"text":"The service was great food and drink wise but it would be nice to have a bit more personality from the staff. A smile doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Comfort food served with  a smile. Very casual dining and large portions. Loved the lime. If only my baked chicken wasn't so dry... The sweet plantain is so tasty! And, the milk coffee is better than my homemade Starbucks brew. I think I'm changing to Peet.   Were we transported to somewhere in South America?"}
