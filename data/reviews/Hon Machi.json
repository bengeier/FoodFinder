{"text":"Stopped going here after all the heath code violations but thought we'd give it one more shot last Friday, wish we hadn't.
Even with reservations we waited over an hour for our food, not because it was busy but because they sat us at a table by ourselves but wouldn't start cooking until more people came in to fill up the table.
It was well over 90 degrees in the restaurant, despite every person complaining they would not or could not help the situation.
Lastly the food is horrible and way overpriced, the \"show\" was a non-starter as well. 
They do still have the dragon lady walking around, frowns for everyone. SMH."}
{"text":"agreeing with jolean s. about horrible service.  i ordered a special which the hostess told me about.  after making my selection and waiting for some time, i was told that the sushi chef was not going to honor the special pricing.  i was in the middle of texting a friend about the great specials this place had.  i walked out as well without trying the food and recanted my rec.  completely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but after the last few visits I'm finished going here. The big problem is the customer service: it's just gotten ridiculously bad, save for two employees (One younger waitress with glasses and a dude who looks like Clark Kent at the sushi bar). I'll take the teppanyaki guys off the hook, I guess, never did try that.

Anyway, all the sushi chefs minus the one I mentioned are either downright irascible or non-attentive. There's one Japanese or Korean guy with glasses who basically acts like you're not even there. We went during the Superbowl, and the place was dead...yet instead of making orders quickly, he joined other staff watching the Superbowl on a TV at the bar; ridiculous. Another visit we saw some guy I think the staff called \"Mr. Han.\" He clearly was getting mad every time we ordered something and due to his poor English (not having a go, just saying) he couldn't understand what I was saying and didn't apologize or anything when he realized what I was asking was a reasonable request (I just asked for no avocado, and he was like \"IT DOES COME WITH AVOCADO!\" all angrily). Staff were clearly walking on egg shells talking to him; I remember that nice glasses waitress addressing him all super-respectfully, made me sad.

Anyway, this last time we went we were going for the 1/2 off sushi lunch. When our waitress, an older lady who I think may be the owner or something, caught wind of that she was all huffy and made sure we realized we had to get at least 5 rolls and that they had to be off a certain section of the menu. Fine. So, we ordered. I asked for no avocado and replace avocado with cream cheese. She informed me that to do so would be $1. In EVERY visit I had come and done this, no charge. Dunno if it's different just because of it being 1/2 off or whatever, but I think it had more to do with her prerogative. Anyway, I just said \"Okay, well just no avocado then.\" Got the rolls, and you guessed it: All ones that had avocado on the menu still had it. I even got the receipt and she put no avocado (on the one, anyway), but it was still there. A meaningless gripe, I guess, but is this really that hard? Both wait staff -and- chefs screwing up (was the inattentive glasses guy, again)

Then, we got the bill. Whaddya know, they don't take off 50%! You can check against the white menu on the right someone posted vs. my receipt. Got two AZ rolls, normal price $8.95 charged- 10.96. 1 tuna roll, normal price $5.50, charged- $3.75 (Should be $2.25, since there's only one). 2 Shrimp Temp rolls, regular price $7.95, charged $9.96. You might say \"well that's each one with tax,\" but as you can see from my receipt they charge tax on the subtotal. 

So, they lost at least two customers and I advise you to stay away. Shame, too, as the place has a nice atmosphere and decent food. Tsk tsk!"}
{"text":"Went here other night for my birthday! Love that they have reservation options and they had the table ready when we were there. Our server was amazingly nice, funny and personable. We had 7 in our party. They went out of their way to make sure we were having fun and made my birthday a great one!"}
{"text":"Went in today to eat dinner, and was seated promptly. However, after that waiters seemed to wander around. To clarify, there were around 20 guests and 3 or so waiters. The waiters gathered by the bar and talked with each other as we sat there. 10 minutes went by and nobody even looked at our table. So we got up and walked out, and a waiter waved like he had no idea we hadn't been served. 

Take this with a grain of salt, because to me, service is so important. I'm in business, and you can easily lose or gain customers by being respectful or showing no regard for customer service. Hope they remedy this."}
{"text":"Edit 10/25/2010
As others already have pointed out, Hon Machi is open again and is currently featuring a very nice customer appreciation promotion!"}
{"text":"The owner treats groupon customers differently! It really hurts my feeling and appetite to eat food. I will never go back to this restaurant again nor purchase groupon deal for this restaurant. 

I came here because of the groupon deal. I am single and I usually take out food and eat at home. However they do not allow customers using groupon to do take outs (which doesn't even say on the groupon restriction) ! 

I went in there and ordered the food and asked for take out after I finished 20% of the food because I want to go home and watch TV and finish the rest of the food. I don't know what my mattress said to her boss but he came out and yelled at me saying that I cannot do this. I told him I am eating here (part of the food) and I am paying for the tip. I am not sure why he was not satisfied with my behavior and he even went to the sushi bar and complained about me to the sushi chef saying WTF words. It was so loud other customers can hear him. 

I just don't feel right on how they are treating groupon customers and I'll never go back knowing how terrible the customer service is."}
{"text":"Dynamite Scallop Rolls are the reason to show up everytime. The sushi taste fresh, and the way is set up is neat. It's a little concerning when I always go to an empty place, but I definitely enjoy the sushi there. I wish I could have reviewed a longer mor in depth review, but I haven't tried any other dish."}
{"text":"Great tepan with a super fun chef! Way better than Benny's."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, especially when the weather is nice and you can eat outside. The restaurant is a small place but their food is excellent, service is respectable. I have dined here roughly around 4 times already and their food has been consistent. I recommend their tootsie rolls, as they do a great job on those. I order those every time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night and had a great time! We were greeted immediately and decided to sit at the sushi bar. Everyone was very friendly and our food was ready so quick! 

We ordered the Las Vegas roll, the Spicy Tuna, and Soft Shell Crab. All was delicious and presented beautifully. I would definitely recommend this place for sushi!"}
{"text":"The service was rediculously bad.  This was at about 8:00pm Saturday night.  After being seated I was ignored for 20 minutes and eventually left. The sushi might be great, I just never got that far."}
{"text":"Good service, nice to go in a group for presentation. Grill items are not bad but sushi is not as fresh or good as it can be. I would come back again just not for sushi."}
{"text":"Perfect teppanyaki experience, both me and my girlfriend ordered the filet, and not only was it an amazing price but it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! We'll definitely be going there again!!!! And their fried rice is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Like a year ago I went there with a friend and it was really good. Recently I went again with my kids telling them that the food there it was good... well, what a surprise. The smell of the restaurant it was like we were next to a trash can and we ordered sushi with raw fish and some tempura. We started with the tempura and plus the soup and salad we were satisfied, but we had all the sushis... thanks god we were full because we tried those and the fish it was all slime and didn't smell bad but it wasn't good to have that in the mouth. We couldn't eat it... we paid and left. No more."}
{"text":"I enjoy the all-you-can-eat sushi experience once a month or two. Main concerns here include that my wife and two kids don't. I'm required to sit at the sushi bar if my wife wants teppanyaki, I cannot sit with my wife and kids to have all-you-can-eat.  Anyone see a problem here?  Yeah, it's kind of silly. What are they concerned about?  Sharing all you can eat food, or someone shoving it down their pants???  I just want to eat what I like  with my family at the same table.  Other downside is limited nigiri options on the all-you-can-eat menu. Due to the difficulties, I always try to stuff myself with the eat as much as you want menu and I leave upset after not sitting with my family. How about a change of your policies??"}
{"text":"Three of us ordered. One of our orders came out and I was wrong. They attempted to correct it, but it was wrong the second time as well. We did not say anything, just dealt with it. After about 45 min, our waitress asked if we needed a box or our check. We responded, \"we're still waiting on the other two orders\". Our waitress went to check on them and returned to explain to us how the cooks were confused about the order & that's why it's taking so long.... bull shit. We then asked for our check and said explained that we'd rather not wait for the other two orders. The waitress brought us our check and charged full price for the one order they actually brought out to us and our drinks. 

Thanks for nothin', Hon Machi!"}
{"text":"One of the better places for teppanyaki. The food and quality are great and the sushi is delicious too. The cooking show is just as fun and entertaining as any of the chains. My favorite and go to every time is the New York strip and scallops. Yum yum. Tried quite a few of the items on the menu and have not been disappointed. Even went on busy Valentine's night with the family (7 and 2 year old boys) and they took us in close to our reservation time...didn't have to wait much longer than the reservation time. The bar is a bit limited on it's mixed cocktail experience, but I was able to find a mixed drink I like that they could make :) -- Otherwise give it a try. It's yummy food...and get the fried rice it's worth the extra $$$"}
{"text":"We went here on a Monday night and reluctantly got the $20 all you can eat sushi deal.  Why reluctantly, well, have you really ever had good all you can eat sushi in your life?  I don't know we were thinking.....except that the sushi and sashimi was really great!!!  We live in the NYC area and go for Sushi at least 1x per week.  This was fresh, well prepared and generous.  Service was nice as well.   OK sake menu.  

1 star off: huge, sprawling place was empty, kind of weird eating by yourself and also the sushi chef (we sat at the bar) didn't really talk to us at all, just our waitress talked to us."}
{"text":"We walked in and It was 5 min before someone took our drink order.   The waiter was scattered and busy and didnt really pay attention to us. The tempura was ok but heavy and greasy and they didn't use real tempura flake batter.  Th calamari was tender but chunky in thick batter. The salmon roll was ok. Not terrible but not fabulous.  The hot lava roll was different again not fabulous. The beef udon pasta style was terrible. Hardly any veggies with the strangest sauce combo- teriyaki on the beef and some mystery sauce on the noodles that didn't taste Asian.  For you Canadian snowbirds out there eat here with caution. Don't expect anything close to what there is in major cities at home."}
{"text":"Been there twice and enjoyed the Teppan tables. Food was excellent, steak was grilled perfect. Chefs do fun tricks and are pleasant."}
{"text":"Great Sushi price for all-you-can-eat sushi at $20.  Lunch special of two rolls for $8.95 is great also, as long as you're dining in.  But if you're trying to get a take-out special, forget about it (even during lunch).  I have children and it's not always convenient to belly up to the bar (for all-you-can-eat sushi).  Unless you have time to sit and enjoy your sushi, prepare to pay a little more to take-out."}
{"text":"Digging the calamari.....my boy loves the Ikura. my only draw back to the place is that they need better ventilation. i just dont like smelling like the place i just ate at."}
{"text":"Great teppanyaki grill! Wonderful service and friendly staff! Our family came here and our children not only loved their meal but enjoyed the entertaining chef! We heard about the restaurant on Groupon and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here thanks to an Amazon coupon - some of the best sushi I've eaten."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome great sushi and great service! Really relaxing place for lunch. Happy hour prices are very good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Hon Machi tonight and have been many times in the past. Our sushi appetizer was great, but our chef was extremely dull. Not very entertaining - which is one of the main reasons for Tepanyaki. 

The food was pretty good but on our way out we saw a cockroach... Gross! Then we turned around to see a cricket! I couldn't believe it. So disgusting. We will never return."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to HonMacHi in Chandler--GO! While their sushi isn't world-renowned they still have a great Vegas Roll and free miso soup. Lunch specials of two rolls for $7.95 is a steal!

I also had the chance to try their teppanyaki. I had only been to the expensive Benihanna in Chandler before. When I went there, I actually ordered seafood that I was I unaware wasn't going to be cooked on the stove. At HonMacHi they at least had a separate menu section for teppanyaki. I had the shrimp which seemed a bit pricey for the place, but was well worth it.

The service can be hit or miss. Recently, it has been excellent but at times has disappointed me with its lack of speed and urgency to get food to customers. Personally, I think they've improved.

If you're on a budget and want quality Asian food, I recommend HonMacHi!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Benihana's and decided to give Honmachi Grill a try since it was closer and slighty cheaper. The teppan show was different, the chef lit a huge amount of oil on fire and my husband commented, \"I didn't really need my eyebrows anyway.\" This is what you came to Yelp for, the food, it was superb. The salad and dressing were better than Benihana and the steak and shrimp teppan were fresh and delicious. My son had a california roll and I tried one it was average. We sat next to a regular who raved about the sushi and ordered a caterpillar roll. I let you know what I think next time I try the sushi. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and it was a little slow, a little dark in the restaurant. The decor could be improved but it is simple and sparse. I don't think that you would be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"So I want to start by saying I am an equal opportunity reviewer.  This was my second trip to this place and was hoping that it would be a better experience the second time since the first wasn't that great. To my dismay it was FAR worse then the first time.  The service was poor from the first step in the door.  When taking our drink orders they didn't even know how to make a simple martini and it took them more than 10 min to make them and then finally take our sushi order. When the sushi finally got to the table it was average at best. The server took forever to just get the soup and salad out.  Now the cook funnily came to the table to cook for us and the point of going to this type of establishment is for good food and some entertainment.  The cook was not interactive at all. This was for sons 5 year old birthday and we brought cupcakes to have .  We ask for 2 scoops of ice cream and it tool almost 10 minutes again and instead of just 2 small scoops they brought out 2 huge sundaes.  At this point in the meal I was not happy and just wanted to leave.  The \"server\" who turned out to be the manager brought the bill and I was shocked to see that they charged us 7.90 for  what was supposed to simply be 2 scoops of ice cream .  I talked to the manager and gave her my card and she did absolutely nothing.  I will NEVER be back here."}
{"text":"Better than the \"chain\" place.  Staff were super friendly and the chef was hilarious.  We had two sushi appetizers and then tepanyaki for a party of 8.  It was all delicious and the portions were huge.  Nice find in Chandler!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the teppan chef prepared everything just right. However... We had to ask them about our appetizer order. They forgot to put it in and it came out when our main course was ready. They also wrote down my main course incorrectly, steak instead of steak and chicken. They blamed it on the \"new girl\". It also took an unreasonable amount of time for them to bring us the check. I will gladly spend my $100 on a special night out somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have had in Arizona.
Since moving from San Francisco 3 years ago I have searched for a sushi place I liked.  Large lunch portions, friendly staff, good food...REAL Crab and Lobster options!
YUM"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and met a friend here for sushi. Since there were only 4 of us and we weren't having teppanyaki, we were seated in the table area. Service was okay in the beginning, but our waitress got better the longer we were there. She even went over our order with us twice to make sure it was correct. I think in all we had 6 sushi rolls, gyozo, and yakisoba noodles. My toddler loved the noodles and miso soup. And the dumplings were yummy. But the sushi was definitely the star. Everything was plated beautifully and it was delicious! The softshell crab roll and California roll were my favorites, but everything we ordered was good! And, it was all reasonably priced. I think the most expensive roll was $10, and we only got 1 of those. We enjoyed our experience and will probably go back to try the teppan."}
{"text":"very good sushi and the service was so speedy and good, thanks to our superb waitress."}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time at Hon Machi for my birthday on a Tuesday night. They were very busy but even with a full restaurant, the server was amazing. The poor woman was literally running from her tables to the kitchen. 

We've been to a few other teppanyaki places in the Valley and have found that they are rarely worth the money.

The food here was absolutely delicious, the server was incredible and the chef was entertaining!

However, the most impressive thing about our experience is that my wallet was left behind. My daughter was playing with it and dropped it on the floor. 

When I called the restaurant they knew exactly who I was and said that my wallet was safe and untouched. That says a lot about the restaurant and the type of people they hire. 

Thank you, Hon Machi! You will always be our first choice for Teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"Be sure to call ahead for Teppanyaki! My parents and I dined here on a Saturday evening; it was definitely a happening time. The proximity of the tables felt a little more crowded than some of the other local options (Benihana/ Kobe), but shared the same price point."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. However they have increased their prices. Now if you want friend rice with your teppan meal it's an extra $2.50. It's used to be included. Also the portions are half of what they used to be. So now it's the same cost as Osaka or Benihana during lunch. Might as well go to one of those because 1)the food is better, 2) the portions are much larger 3) the show is FAR better. Over experience is much better. We have been to Hon Machi probably 30 times in the last 4 years. I do not believe we will be going back."}
{"text":"nothing was really great, I would definitely continue to try other places before ever going back."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Gordon Ramsey would close them down!  Very low standards.  First we ordered Tempura Shrimp & Vegetables, a favorite appetizer of ours.  Both orders came out dripping with oil.  I asked our server, who did not speak good English for some paper napkins.  I individually placed each shrimp or veggie in a paper napkin and gently pressed down on each side hoping I could salvage my order and my husbands.  I went through 3 tri-fold, double layer paper napkins just for my order.  The entire napkin was saturated with oil and the veggies were so limp they flopped when picked up.

My husband suggested that we just show our server so she could explain to the cook that they were either using oil that was not hot enough or not cooking everything long enough.  She took our orders back to the kitchen to show the cook along with the oil soaked napkins but we were not sure she completely understood the problem as you brought back two new orders that looked just the same.  Not wanting to create a fuss, I tried the napkin trick again which just became soaked with oil again.

I wanted to make the best of it so I cut into one of the three shrimps they give you per order and there was the long \"vein\" (poop sack) running all the way through it.  Then I cut into the middle of the other two shrimp which also had not been cleaned of the poop sacks.  The woman who had seated us came over (hostess?  manager?) and she looked at the shrimp and said \"we take that out always\" (meaning the \"vein\") as if to say that what we were saying was a mirage.  We showed her the \"vein\" up close and she repeated that they always take it out and that what we were seeing wasn't possible (yet there it was!).  We cut open the shrimp all the way and took out the worm-like \"vein\" and let it dangle.  We asked for the $17 or so charge for the two tempura appetizers be removed from the bill since loaded with grease and with uncleaned shrimp.  I'm jumping ahead, but when she later came back with the bill, she had only take one of the two shrimp orders off because she said \"we made them twice.\"  We stood up for ourselves and politely told her that they were inedible and that they prepared them poorly in both cases.  Reluctantly she removed the two appetizers from the bill.  (In case you are nonetheless game to risk trying the tempura, not that the shrimp are almost all batter and that the actual shrimp is long and skinnier than a child's middle finger).

We then order teppan dinners (cooked on the tabletop).  I ordered filet and lobster.  It comes with Miso soup, salad and shrimp \"appetizer.  We have eater Teppan all over the country.  The Miso soup had a weird taste and was in a cloudy not clear broth like usual.  My filet was small but tender and perfectly cooked.  The fried rice had only a few peas and carrots in it (skimp) and they used a weird garlic butter which changed the flavor I am used too.  The veggies included a few tiny broccoli tops (maybe 5 per serving), shaved dried out carrot rounds that were paper thin, maybe 2 mushrooms, three or four overcooked bean sprouts, a few zucchini sticks and no cabbage.  Again, very skimpy.  The lobster was chewy and had a disturbing smell.  I ate only the steak off my plate (and I *NEVER* complain or send anything back).  The rest of the untouched lobster was about $17 more then the steak alone would have been.  The server noticed I had not touched my lobster but appeared to be done eating.  She sent the same Asian woman over who told us we had to pay for the lobster because she had already taken the two appetizers off the bill (one having nothing to do with the other.

My husband also noticed that they put the uncooked veggies on the shelf of the cart that the Teppan chef cooks from.  It was directly on the metal shelf (and we saw them reusing the carts without cleaning them).  No platters or even towels were used.  The food was placed right on the shelf's surface.

I give them a \"F\" for food quality and skimpiness and a double F for forcing us to pay $98 for two substandard entrees that were barely touched (which they knew).  You are not gaining anything by wanting food taken off the bill that you never ate.

If you want GREAT Japanese food & tepan, it is worth the drive to Sappora in Scottsdale.  If you want fair to good  Japanese food & Tepan, go to Benihana at Chandler Mall.  But whatever you do, avoid Han Machi At Alma School & Queen Creek in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! We had 5 different people ask us if we wanted a table or the grill. Waited about 30 min just to get something. Got skipped over twice. Everyone was in a bad mood. I'm never recommending this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays.  

Need I say more?

Their sushi is pretty damn good for being located in a landlocked state.  The food is made by real Japanese dudes.  

This has been my preferred sushi spot even before they had that $19.99 deal.  They prepare their sushi better than any sushi restaurant in AZ.

I've gone to places like.. I don't want to name names, but it rhymes with \"RAW\" and \"Rona Brill\",  ; ) and the food at those places seem pretentious and watered down, not to mention expensive as f*ck.  

The sushi at HonMachi Grill is made better, tasted better, is a better value, and is more authentic than the above named/hinted restaurants.

Also, try their teppan grill.  The surf and turf is excellent.  It certainly kicks the crap out of anything that restaurant that sounds like \"Benny Hannah\" puts out.

With that said, I'd like to leave you with these parting words:

$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays.  

P.S.

$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it's actually tough for me to rate this one a 2 because though I did have pretty good memories here, mostly with the Teppanyaki entertainment, I also had one memory that was really not-so-good.. So I'll just stick to a 1.25.

The good memories (let's start off positive):
This place is Teppanyaki style, so actually a good spot for a big group that want to eat their hearts out (the portions are super filling, like most Teppanyaki joints).  We've only experience that and not the sushi bar nor the other seating area for non-Teppanyaki.  The staff has been on-par, not amazing, just good and the food is also good and plentiful.

The bad stuff:
Their sashimi salad here is BLAH compared to Mikado's (right across the street) and so is their Miso soup and their Tempura veggies.. alll crappy compared to Mikado's.
No flavor, no care for quality.. just kind of throw together recipes because it's expected of them.
and finally...
When we had Teppanyaki with my sister a while back, guess what was slowly crawling the wall behind her... a f*ing roach! 

There! And now you know why it's a 1.25!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here for the second time & it was an even better experience than the first time! My boyfriend & I each ordered a Teppanyaki dish - one teriyaki chicken & one vegetable. The man who was cooking our food for us was very entertaining ... He even invited one of us to come up to the grill & toss an egg to crack for the fried rice. He made a big heart shape out of the rice before serving it on our plates. The tofu was well cooked (and neither of us are really fans of tofu), the teriyaki chicken tasted great. The portion sizes were large so there were some leftovers, but still the meal was a decent price. Overall, we had a really good experience."}
{"text":"Any time you go to teppan it's going to be expensive but the quality of the service and food should be on par with the dollaz.  

I think Hon Machi is about where it should be in terms of service and food.  Albeit, I haven't tried the sushi, the teppanyaki has always been great.  

I have three kids (*gasps*) and I often dread going anyplace that doesn't scream 'KIDS MEAL' when I'm taking the gang out.  But every once in while you gotta suck it up and do it.  

Hon Machi was very accommodating.  My kids were on their best behavior.  They actually do have a kid's menu from which my son ordered yakisoba with the veggies on the side.  No prob.  The dish came quick from the kitchen.

My daughter had the kids shrimp and it was plenty for her plus the fried rice.  Both my wife and I had the shrimp/steak combo and we had no complaints.

When it comes to teppan, I'm no expert.  I've been a couple times and I like the atmosphere of this place.  I like that the teppan chefs are outgoing and make the experience enjoyable.  Yeah, they joke.  Yeah, they flame that grill out and throw things around but that's what I want if I'm gonna drop some coin.

Go.  Decide for yourself.

I think it's good and actually it wasn't all that expensive."}
{"text":"great alternative to Benihana. yes, it's true the chefs here are not as animated or charismatic as the ones at Benihana. but forget that and just focus on the food, it's actually comparable to more expensive places. I had steak and shrimp, and my kids had the kids size teriyaki chicken. everyone was full and we had leftovers. the veggies and meats were cooked perfectly without being burned. it is worth it to get the fried rice for a little extra. great food, big portions."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and super friendly staff. Great find in Arizona, considering I come from the north east. Had the sashimi salad which was delicious and filled with tons of good sized fresh fish and a delicious dressing. So happy with this place and I hope to get back there soon. Don't know about happy hour deals or anything because I went on a weeknight, but I assume it can only get better."}
{"text":"So when I wrote this review and ate there I was actually 12 weeks pregnant and had no idea. So the nausea and sickness may have been from the pregnancy. So I'll update my rating to 3 stars. Sorry about that."}
{"text":"Sadly, the restaurant seems to have changed owners and the quality of the service has plummeted. We went here on Mother's Day for lunch several months ago and were not told until we sat down and were only handed the dinner menu  AND asked the server that dinner prices were being charged that day (more than twice the price, albeit slightly more food). We decided to stay and noticed that we were not being served the food that the dinner menu included. When politely asking our chef, he was extremely rude and sarcastic and verbally abused the poor hostess gal in front of everyone for not \"informing\" him that the dinner menu was being served. The hostess then swore at him and asked him to \"call her by the right F***ing name.\" Very unprofessional for both of them. While we understand that the restaurant business can be stressful, take a moment to breathe and settle frustrations away from customers. The chef then continued cooking as before, without correcting the menu mistake. Thus, we had to ask again. He turned to the couple and small child who were seated with our family (whose order he had also messed up) and said to their little girl, \"You are the only one I will serve because you are the only one who doesn't complain.\"  Yes, how dare both families politely ask to be served what they paid for? 

*Sigh.* Disappointed. This was my favorite place and now I will never go back, regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Good overall sushi place.

Food was good but nothing outstanding or out of the ordinary. Decor is pretty basic on the contemporary side.

Pretty traditional sushi place."}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner and for families. Huge sushi bar and a great atmosphere. We had a great cook who has been in the industry for over 30 years. The waiter was good and kept up with drinks and hospitality ! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"**ATTENTION GROUPON USERS**. For those of your who purchased their groupon and tried using it on July 3rd (i heard them turn down the use of the groupon to the table behind us) I contacted groupon regarding the fact that i purchased the groupon and upon my attempts to use it on July 3, 2012, my waitress directed to me to the additional fine print that stated i was not able to use it until \"July 4th after 12PM\" It turns out that groupon allowed Honmachi's fine print to remain editable for 24 hours and after July 3rd the owners went back into their groupon and deleted the portion restricting the time frame in which it could be used. This act was extremely dishonest to their customers and since contacting groupon they have returned my funds. I will never be returning to this establishment in the future and would not recommend it either. The food itself makes it not worth returning to, the service is slow and they need to learn professionalism and the owners are obviously corrupt and none of these are acceptable from any establishment. Take your business else where and support HONEST locals like the family owned establishment of Sushi San about 15 minute drive and VERY worth it!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Benihana for date night and really enjoyed Hon Machi. The service was great, the chef was fun and the food was delicious. I particularly liked the open floor plan in the restaurant. We got a variety of shrimp, steak and scallops; Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted great. One thing I liked better here than Benihana was the space at the tables. At Hon Machi there is plenty of room to eat and not feel like you're sitting right on top of your table mates. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or just a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner this evening. It was my first time trying this place and I don't think I'll be back. 

The service was pretty awful. No one came by to refill my drink or offer me water, and the glass was empty for over 10 minutes. Finally the waiter came and took the empty glass--all without offering the refill. 

The sushi didn't make up for the service. The California roll was poorly wrapped and fell apart as I was eating it. The spicy tuna roll was better, but not by much. Something about the flavors was not right, but I'm not sure what. The complimentary miso soup was a nice touch, it's true, but had almost no seaweed or tofu in it!

And that was $17?  No thanks, I'd much rather go to Mikado, right across the street, which has much better food and much better service."}
{"text":"Customer service was very good... atmosphere is very \"benihana\", but there is also booth and table seating.

The soup they bring out prior to the meal was very simple, but very good.

We had the Philadelphia Roll, California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and a Potato Mountain roll.

All were very good, considering I'm still a newb to eating sushi.  For my woman and I with tip, it was around $50.

I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Always good sushi. And the Teppanyaki is good, but not great. Stick with the sushi. But definitely a place I'll go back to."}
{"text":"I am originally from Hawaii and visit Chandler with my boyfriends family about once a year. I am always on the lookout for great sushi and this place had THE BEST SPICY TUNA I have had outside of the islands. It was SO good, in fact my mouth is still watering!! We had the unlimited sushi which was awesome. Everything tasted really fresh and the sushi chef was very cool and made my spicy tuna as a nigiri when I asked. It was a great experience and I had a good time. Also their fried rice is quite good, nice taste of mushrooms, yum yum! Will return again and again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I love the teppanyaki and the sushi was really fresh."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  

They were closed briefly due to a liquor license issue, and I went around to a ton of other sushi places looking for the quality and value I was used to from Hon Machi.  No dice.  

I go at lunchtime with friends usually, and if you order 5 rolls you get a great deal.  Their Volcano roll is the best I've had anywhere.  This is my favorite sushi place bar none, and I'm so happy they have reopened and have all of their licenses."}
{"text":"I give them 3.5 stars.  Pretty good, but nothing outstanding.  I thought the food, beverage, and service were OK and the atmosphere OK too.  Don't get me wrong; nothing to complain about, but nothing outstanding either.  Portions were adequate, but keep in mind that teppan yaki is a pretty expensive meal.  $30 average for a few shrimps and meat/chicken and vegetables stir fried on a griddle.  Our teppan chef was not much of a showman regarding knife and spatula skills, but he was hilarious as a stand up comedian.  I think they need a little work on their sauces, including the salad dressing -- pretty boring and uninspiring.  Again, please do not be mislead by this review -- I was not disappointed and the experience was  good.  Just that it was not outstanding.  We ordered a lot of drinks and a variety of meals --- filet, NY steak, shrimps, scallops, calamari steaks, and chicken breast.  So we probably experienced the whole array of offerings sans the lobster."}
{"text":"Sesame octopus good, weird unagi sauce. Way too much rice!  That worries me they don't trust their fish..."}
{"text":"After informing the hostess that I required a gluten-free meal, we were seated at our very own tepanyaki grill.  Our chef ensured that he cooked my meal first, so as not to contaminate my meal with soya sauce in the fried rice for the rest of my party.  I was able to have the meat (chicken and filet), vegetables, miso soup, and plain white rice (no soya sauce).  I also got the salad with no dressing (yuck, I hate lettuce with no dressing).  While there were no special gluten-free surprises (like GF soya sauce or salad dressing), it was very appreciated that we were given our own grill and that my meal was made first.  There was also one dipping sauce that I was told that I could have, although, I am not sure what it was (it was good).  Overall, the meat and vegetables were excellent!!  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Oh, and the showmanship by the chefs was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"We went for teppanyaki lunch & used a Groupon; it was a great experience! We ate New York Steak & Chicken Teriyaki, and Mango Salad. All of it was delicious, not to mention the provided side dishes (miso soup, house salad, fried rice, fried veggies) were all yummy and tasty as well.  

I used to go to teppanyaki a lot as a kid, and it all tasted familiar and as I remembered it. I'd come here again, especially since the Steak itself is only 9.95; a total deal w/ all the sides!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Go to Japanese place in Chandler. Considering the peak hour traffic, still had good service."}
{"text":"Service was average at best. Water and tea were refilled in an ok amount of time. However the fish was absolutely bland. The second worst I've had hands down I the valley. Won't be back. Bought a groupon and will let them know the same. My wife had a scallop dynamite and the crab was all mayo. Nasty. My nigiri was so tasteless. Just ate here and nervous for rest of the night. Atmosphere is fine. Totally overpriced. I compare all sushi here in the valley by San Francisco and San Diego standards where I lived for 17 years. Don't waste a dinner here. Bought a groupon and had them refund. I was very surprised that Groupon would put there name on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good again tonight! Can't go wrong with ordering their teppan. Great chefs, service and prices. House wine is good: 120 brand. Amazing happy hour. Definitely a fan! Lost a diamond earning here once and the owner took apart her vacuum and found it. Talk about customer service and satisfaction! Hence the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not a good experience food was \"ok\" I have had better. They forgot to put in our appetizer and blamed that on the broken grill. Then messed up our order and blamed it on the \"new girl\". We sat and waited and waited finished eating with a tired 2 year old for our check. It was a hot mess there we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for Teppanyaki always have a good experience here the Teppanyaki chefs are fun and make it very entertaining family friendly and a good price point."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for good food, a dim-but-well-lit, comfortable atmosphere for a couple's night out or a family get together and don't mind a little heat then this is the place to go.  Football games were on the 4 or 5 flatscreens that sat in the corners of the walls, which made my husband happy.  The bar seemed to be well equipped and was available but not a major presence in the room.  The food was pretty good, at least the quality of an Outback Steakhouse, Chili's or Applebee's but Japanese cuisine of course.  The prices were decent too.  The teppan show is what would make me go back.  The grill chef was entertaining to say the least.  The kids laughed the entire time he cooked.  He made the food impersonate worms, joked about the miso being peanut butter, and pretended to throw his knives.  The kids caught shrimp he flew in the air.  He was so entertaining, my 13 year old daughter 'videoed' the entire performance.  And, she's pretty hard to impress.  They brought out the cake for my step son's birthday and sang him a Japanese song which I assume was the Japanese version of Happy Birthday."}
{"text":"My family loves the sushi here. During happy hour, prices are great. I love lunch specials and the availability of teppan as well. The service is really hit and miss but as long as I get a food at a reasonable time I will continue to go. I feel like the sushi has real flavor as opposed to the bland americanized flavors."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Hon Machi a couple of months back. We wanted some sushi and we new to the area.
When we walked in, there was a man yelling that he would never come back here... Not off to a good first impression so far. The place wasn't too busy, maybe two of the tables were being used and no one was at the sushi bar. 

We stood in the front for several minutes, while servers continually seemed not to notice us. We eventually decided to just seat ourselves at the sushi bar. 

A waitress came about 10 mins later and took our drink orders, but did not provide us with any menus. The overall customer service was terrible. We gave it about five more minutes after she dropped the drinks off and decided to just leave."}
{"text":"We just drove back from the airport from a seven day cruise in to the Caribbean had a fantastic time. Customer service was incredible and the food was awesome"}
{"text":"Food was not clean.. some shrimp were not properly deveined. Poor attitude by chef/staff when brought up. Never coming to this place again"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a work friend and she was right! The sushi chef was very friendly and one of the other chefs was also - gave me advice on making better Pho. I had some Salmon sashimi, a couple of rolls, and it was all very good. Not sure how their all you can eat works but if it matched what you get at Mido, I would definitely go back and try it. They had two teppan tables going also and the chef's looked pretty good."}
{"text":"We love this place,  We go there as often as we can.  The food is great, the staff is friendly and always remembers us.  It is a great place to enjoy a 'grown up' meal with a small child.  

We have celebrated may special days there, and we will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and tepan - period. Not the \"high-end\" places but a rock solid place with lots of variety and good prices."}
{"text":"Freshest sushi in Chandler.  Good service, great food."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  My family and I love sushi and finding a spot in the Chandler area was tough until we found Hon MacHi!"}
{"text":"I first came here with my family and some close friends right before I left for college and recently came back with my family for lunch.  Although it's usually expensive, I had a Groupon so for our family of four, it wasn't too bad, and we ate heartily.  Teppan is so much fun and the sushi is also great.  Our favourite rolls are the catepillar, Las Vegas, and soft shell crab, although the Vegas is definitely not the best for the body (deep fried, but soooo good).  Scallop teppan is really tasty, but my dad likes the fillet mignon.  Make sure that your teppan chef has flare; don't be afraid to request a volcano, train, or some cool balancing feat with the egg.  It's only fun when your chef is fun as well.  This time, the guy didn't look like he was really into the entertaining aspect (the veggies were already chopped up, meaning that we miss half the show), but the server was really nice."}
{"text":"Where is the fish?  We ordered spicy salmon rolls and a yellow tail roll.  All the rolls only had the smallest sliver of fish. It was all rice and cucumber.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Three stars because my husband ordered from the teppanyaki menu and liked his meal - and didn't get sick. 
I however, ordered sushi. I got sick and was up all night. Something in one of my rolls didn't taste right so I quit eating after the second bite...but the other two rolls I finished. Big mistake.
I'm so disappointed because we live in a neighborhood nearby and wanted to frequent this place. Sad to say, once you have bad sushi it's hard to go back. If I do I'll be steering clear of the sushi and ordering from the teppanyaki menu only."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! Ordered California rolls, 2 adult orders chicken fried rice and side of kids noodles. Rice was brown rice with few tiny pieces of chicken. We sent it back and requested for eggs and carrots and peas in it (as usual).They split 1 rice, added shredded carrots and put in 2. I inquired again but server said that's how it is. They charged $9.95 for small kids noodles! Don't waste time here."}
{"text":"We only come here when a groupon exists.  It's a bit pricey without a deal involved,  but that's normal for teppan restaurants.  The service here was fast and the food is delicious.  Very nice chef with the usual tricks and great attitude.  Can someone please think of additional tricks for these chefs?  I can almost do the routine myself...choo choo... heart beat, etc.  

Had a Mai Tai that was refreshing.  The miso soup is yummy.  The fried rice is extra fyi.  You kinda have to double tip here.  The chef and the server."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic from the food to the service. The fried rice that comes with the teppanyaki is excellent. The sushi was really good as well. The prices on the sushi card are inaccurate. I remember the card saying $7.50 for a philly roll, but we were only charged $5.50. We were celebrating a birthday, and they offer a $8 package which includes a tray of sponge cakes with whipped cream foe everyone, ice cream for the birthday person, and a photo of your whole party in a Hon Machi card.

We had a great first time experience and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food made me sick and my family and I were discriminated against. My husband and I are a interracial couple and we have three small children. We ate our food and our children were extremely behaved. We sat on a table with a lady and her child. One of the workers went to the lady sitting across from us and apologized to her for having to sit with us and asked if we were too loud. The lady was suprised by the workers questions and said no they were fine. The worker than apologized again and asked the lady's daughter if she wanted a desert and brought her out some icecream. I was shocked considering there was no reason for her to ask such ridiculous question. I am on my way home and my stomach is killing me. I got sick from the food. I can't believe they discriminated against my family and I. Not to mention the bathrooms are disgusting. The walls are dirty and look like they have rats or roaches. I will never go to this place. They obviously discriminate and there food made me sick."}
{"text":"The Grill is terrible! The veggies have NO flavor.   It is really overpriced for what you get.  However, they do have excellent Miso Soup.  Skip the grill and stick with Sushi if you go here.  They make excellent, Fresh Sushi."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty slow considering it wasn't busy in the restaurant. Usually this would be fine but then when we finally got our food it took another few minutes for the rest of the meal- which by the way didn't taste all that great. We may have been \"hangry\" but usually you'd be over it at the end of the meal. We left disappointed and still hungry because the sushi rolls weren't very big and the hand roll wasn't either (and not a lot of flavor) Maybe next time I'll try the hibachi side."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times the food was fabulous.  Ate at the cooking table both times, and had the vegetable dinner both times.  It comes with tofu and it was prepared differently both times.  Good both times, but I did prefer it the first time I was there.

Our chef was great!  A lot of fun, and very friendly!  Sadly he had just put in his two weeks notice and was transferring to the Goodyear location.

All in all, a great place.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We adore this location of Hon Machi as my husband can fill up on sushi and I can get teppan delivered to my table in the regular dining room without having to sit through the show.  Not to mention the fact that you have a direct view of the teppan spectacle from the dining room.  I typically order the exact same thing every time - gyoza (fried from frozen, I'm sure, but I could care less), the steak and shrimp dinner and a massive mound of fried rice, vegetables plus salad and miso soup.  It's not the cheapest meal, but the food comes out deliciously hot and tasty, so we always end up returning.  My husband swears by both the quality and portion size of their sushi with their rainbow roll and lobster roll as two of his favorites.

We have always had good service in the dining room, but because the waiters have to work both our side of the restaurant and the cooking tables, I've seen some pretty sluggish service for other tables at times.  Knock on wood - we've never been one of those unfortunate tables waiting an eternity for someone to take their drink order.  also worth mentioning, there is usually a long wait for teppan tables on the weekend, with lots of families and prom dates going for dinner.  If you sit in the dining room, you can pretty much bypass the wait and they will still serve you the entire menu.  Also, with all of the cooking going on, this place tends to get a  little warm sometimes, so dress accordingly.

All in all, one of my favorite Japanese places in the Valley :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to when I am missing Hawaii! This has theee best Japanese tenpenyaki food. Great, clean, friendly, fast and affordable."}
{"text":"Maybe I like this place for sentimental reasons, but my family home is near here, and we would go for family dinner here pretty often. 
They have teppan grills, and they do the shows similar to the ones at larger teppanyaki chains. But there is also an area for those who don't want to be in front of the grill. They have decently priced, ok, sushi. But they offer a full menu of other Japanese food too. I find that there is good service, and it's close to home. Not the best Japanese food I've ever had, nor the best sushi, but I like it. It's homey."}
{"text":"Pros:  I called to make reservations on Valentine's day and they had availability and the teppan cook was pretty entertaining.

Cons:  I placed an order for noodles the same time as everyone else that ordered for teppanyaki.  The teppan cook came out and did his thing.  Everyone was eating and yet, I still did not have my noodles.  Luckily, I was able to share some teppanyaki food from my partner.  I was already getting full when I finally was served my noodles.  The taste and flavor of the teppanyaki was ok.  The steak was slightly undercooked and the yakisoba noodles were horrible.  I could not eat it but at least my partner enjoyed them.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Brought our whole family (6)for lunch on superbowl Sunday. Several of the teppanyaki tables were going. They did have 2 chefs going. So that was definitely beneficial. We did stand at the front for more then several minutes without a \"hi\" or \"we will be right with you\". They were short staffed for a weekend for servers though. 

Food experience"}
{"text":"#1 Cold rice.  The owner said that we received sushi rice, despite the fact that the menu said it would be fried rice.  Who wants sushi rice with chicken teriyaki?  Reluctantly they brought hot rice.
#2 Wrong order.  We pointed to the menu and ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and vegetables.  Received no vegetables and white (cold) rice.  The owner said because we didn't sit at the teppan table we received the regular order of teriyaki chicken. Although we have purchased this in the past in the same booth.  
#3  Chicken teriyaki was cold, and I don't mean lukewarm.
#4  Had to wait for new orders and the birthday girl waited an additional 10 minutes for hers.
#5  When new order arrived, it was missing the California roll (it was a Bento Box)
#6  Charged credit card twice for the order. 

Maybe this was a bad day for Hon Machi, but for everything to go wrong . . . . and we didn't receive any sincere apologies or compensation for a disastrous meal."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over five years. And recently experienced my final visit. Due to old food and poor service. Ordered shrimp temp roll, and the shrimp was old and re-heated. Our server gave us major attitude when we asked to get fresh miso soup. Never again will we go back."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon which was 50% off and used it at the sushi bar.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Decent service, tasty sushi, reasonable prices.  If I'm in this area again and crave sushi, I'll stop in."}
{"text":"Love it here! People are nice and is best to go during lunch time, been about 10 times now!"}
{"text":"Kristen here. Let me preface by saying that the food is absolutely 5 star worthy. I have only had the teppanyaki experience, so my review is for only that. The fried rice is to die for, and I usually get the filet. It is so so so very good. Since you are seated 8 to a table, regardless of how many you came with, the wait between ordering your food and actually receiving it after the show can take up to an hour. If you are hungry right now, don't go here. However, if you can wait it out, it is absolutely worth it. The show/presentation is hit or miss. Usually it's pretty good, though. They do the same tricks each time, but it is always so fun to have kids at the table and watch their expressions. It is an overall fun experience, as long as you come when it is lively and full. It's no fun if you're the only ones in the establishment. Also, my sister used to work here, and they were a little bit shady with her pay and her boss drove her to a different location on her first day... weird. Hon Machi only gets a high review from us because the food is killer. I would come here over Benihana any day of the week. However if you are looking for the better *experience* then I think Benihana may be a better choice for you."}
{"text":"Such a nice, quaint place.  We've been  to so many teppanyaki places in the area and have been disappointed by their prices and service.

The food was great and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! The sushi is the best I've ever had and their entrees are also very good. The service is so friendly as well. You can either dine up at the sushi bar, experience their teppan or sit in their dining area. I love this place! It's always our first choice when wanting sushi."}
{"text":"Lunch today - Teppanyaki grill and sushi. Maguro (tuna) sashimi was excellent. Spicy tuna handrolls good, no complaints. Smoked salmon rolls good as well.

Teppan grill was very good - friendly chef that did a very good job entertaining my small group, answering questions about the menu and the food in general. Everything was cooked perfectly and the quantity of food was good. My only complaint would be the mixed vegetables were a BIT lacking. Could have used more but now I'm being picky.

I (as well as another sushi loving group member) was really impressed with the sashimi, so much so that I will come again specifically for it. I'll also expand to other items on the menu for a comparison check.

Hard to judge a place by a single experience but I was happy with this choice for a small group celebration event. Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but not the best in town. They use warm rice and vinegar for sushi but I don't like the taste due to too much vinegar. Price is slightly above average."}
{"text":"We had an amazon local deal for this place and we spent it on the sushi bar. First the service was great. We were greeted at the door and promptly seated we ordered drinks and settled to order sushi. By the time the miso soup came, our first rolls were already ready! Talk about fast! The chef repeated our order to make sure they were correct and everything tasted great! 

We're from out of town and this place is on par for what we're used to in Vegas. I definitely would recommend this place with or without an amazon local deal!"}
{"text":"Nothing pretentious here. Just sushi meets sashimi meets sake meets Saba meets maguro. Some of the special rolls here seem to be ambitious but it's all presented freshly and in mouth watering splendor. Try the seafood dynamite and the tootsie rolls. I personally was not ready for the chimichanga roll but when in AZ, do as the Mexicans, n'est pas? I am not hating the Saturday special now running where all simple sushi is a dollar and all other rolls and such are further discounted! Good value in general and satisfying. If you'd prefer to go Hibachi style, this is a fun place to consider. It's clean, modest, charming, and quick."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour, sushi was decent and service was quick. However, the website was completely different than their actual menu and the happy hour menu is 100% different! Which was very disappointing. 

The new happy hour is only 50% off when you order 5 regular rolls or more... Again website says completely different. So beware it's not as great as it looks if you and  only 1 other person are going there together."}
{"text":"The service for lunch was very quick and attentive. I loved their fresh iced green tea, reminded me of Korea. The 2 for $8 sushi special was inexpensive and tasted wonderful. I recommend the tempura shrimp and spicy yellowtail. 
The hibachi chef wasn't as flashy as most but the food was very well done and portion size was decent. 
Definitely recommend for lunchtime dining."}
{"text":"Food was great! Perfectly cooked along with some great craftsmanship of the cook! Service was good to start, got our food quickly and drinks were refilled in a timely manner. The only two knocks was the time it took to get our bill and the chairs need updating.  Chairs have duct tape on them to \"fix\" the tears. If they would get new chairs this place would be a 5 star!"}
{"text":"We have been to other Hon Machis in the past and really like them. This was our first visit to this location. Overall it was great!

We didn't have \"real\" sushi, just an avocado roll (which was really good), so this review is only on the teppanyaki. Dinner was awesome - great service, great chef, great food (steak, shrimp and tofu dinners), great drinks (sake and mixed drinks). We really prefer the taste/sauces/flavor of Hon Machi vs other similar restaurants. Overall a great meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi. We odered uni, salmon roe, tuna, and shrimp nigiri. Also salmon sashimi. Only 4 stars because it took a while to seat us when it was not busy, and also service was slow."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the food was amazing. Probably the best fried rice I've had. We did teppanyaki with the kids and they loved it. Our chef was Daniel; he was engaging and really got the kids into it."}
{"text":"Iove the food but hate the wait. That's the only thing that keeps us from going. Other than that, our family enjoys this place but you really need to carve out some time if your goal is to have the meal cooked at the table."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, my family of seven decided to go out for dinner without reservations.

Red Lobster had a wait time of 90 minutes.
Carrabas wanted us to wait 45 minutes.
Neither was my pick.

So when my cousin suggested sushi, I almost did a back flip.

Hon MacHi seated us within 10 minutes. The wait is much longer if you want tepanyaki grill seating, but we just wanted sushi.

Hon MacHi nails the simple rolls, and their eel rolls are to die for. I typically don't like eel rolls. They generally are too warm and taste kinda off. But Hon MacHi makes them fresh, with warm eel and cold rice.

The only item I didn't enjoy was the seafood dynamite, which I considered a disgusting affront to all things sushi, even Americanized sushi.

The green tea ice cream made a lovely dessert, and Hon MacHi has premade rubber-band chopsticks for kids. My niece and nephew really enjoyed eating like grown-ups.

Overall, we gorged ourselves (five adults and two youngsters) for $180."}
{"text":"Great food ! We did not do Teppan instead electing to have several small plates ...sashimi, shrimp and veg tempura, chicken yakatori and udon noodles ... all delicious
Service was weird... like we were not anybody's responsibility... 4 servers not communicating with each other"}
{"text":"I don't know if this Hon Machi and the one on Dobson and Ray are related, so if they are, the one on Dobson and Ray is amazing, so this is not meant for that location.

My husband and I went to this Hon Machi on Alma School Road, and there was only one waitress who was also the hostess, and there were at least 20 people in the dining room. 

Need I say more? It wasn't the poor girl's fault, her manager understaffed her, and I could tell how frazzled she was. I've been in her shoes, and it sucks. But we didn't have the time or patience to wait 10 minutes for a refill on our drinks. We asked for a refund on a few rolls we didn't eat because the service was ridiculous. We paid the bill, left and will never return. 

Who knows if this is how the business is run on a daily basis, but it only takes one bad experience. We definitely won't be back, but we'll definitely be going to the location on Ray and Dobson. That place never fails us!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only three stars. Great affordable and quick sushi spot. The hibachi style chefs too. Happy hour here is a great deal"}
{"text":"Our teppan table was crazy boring. Basically the chef cooked and didn't even do that well. He burned my fish and our vegetables. I was excited to bring our kids to have a show in front of us; it was going to be a special event. While the tables around us has fire and fun, we had nothing. The most exciting thing our chef did was make noise with the salt shaker.  

It might have been his first time ever cooking teppan. I think I maybe could have done it with a bit more flair.

We will not be back."}
{"text":"Teppan style dining or traditional tables.   We had a showman for the chef.   I had scallops, chicken, fried rice and veggies, all of which were cooked exactly, nothing over or under done.  It's a great place to get together with a group to enjoy a meal.  There are sushi options, traditional Japanese fare, etc.    I'll continue to come back"}
{"text":"I love Teppanyaki. It is always good fun and usually good food. I have been to several different places and I some how always end up back at the \"B\" because other places just don't compare. 

The cook that we had was just okay. He rushed cooking our meal and was mumbling the whole time. It sounded like he was trying to be entertaining but his voice was so low that you could barely hear him because the fan for the grill was so loud. Before we knew it the food was all cooked and he was on his way.  I overheard him tell another table he works there 6 days a week. It was probably his Friday so he was ready to go home. 

As for the food...I must say that the miso soup and salad they serve prior to you main meal was excellent. The dressing in the salad was super good (I mean pick up the bowl and drink the dressing good).  The filet and shrimp for my main course was just right. He was right on with how I like my steak, juicy. They also serve veggies which is a mixture of mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, broccoli, onions and zucchini. I don't like how the serve it all together, I would prefer them separate so I can tell them what I don't like otherwise it's wasted food. The fried rice that I paid an extra 2.50 for was horrible. It was mushy and devoured with soy sauce. I don't like that I pay extra money for something that turns out to be botched. 

Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. She gets a gold star. 

Overall, this place has potential. Maybe I'll try another cook next time."}
{"text":"Walked in with a party of four, stood at the front for 10 minutes. They were clearly understaffed. We had a coupon from Amazon that gave no clear distinction that it couldn't be used for lunch specials. When they told us we only could order from the regular menu we were ok. Now we weren't trying to nickel and dime them, but we asked if we would be allowed to use ALL of our coupon for 3 people's meal, which would have taken care of their bill a little, and then a separate check for their lunch menu. They said because we were at the same table we couldn't do that. Which is ridiculous if you're doing separate checks. The waitress didn't know what some items on the menu were. We were treated very poorly from the start and whatever policies there was no apology for executing them or discussion. We were treated like idiots"}
{"text":"Madeline was our server during lunch. Very friendly and attentive. I ordered a bento box and my husband got teriyaki beef. Prices were reasonable and portions were generous.  Wish my CA roll was a little colder, but overall our food was delicious and we will be back."}
{"text":"The first time we went here, it was pretty good. The second time, it was mediocre, the sashimi and sushi were prepared with gloves on sometimes and off at other times, with plenty of slapping on the back and shoulder without a glove of someone back there who didn't belong there, yack yack yacking to one of the chefs. The glove did not go right back on until later when the chef remembered. That happened several times, more slapping on the back and shoulder. The tip of the iceberg was when we ordered scallops and were served some cheap fish in the shape of a scallop. We were lied to about what it was and finally, the chef admitted - sort of - saying it was a different kind of scallop,. My husband said it was skate, a cheap substitute. They tried to make it look like a scallop. The owner/Matre D or whatever insisted we pay the price of scallops no matter what it was. AND, the food was horrible, not fresh at all, and we're not going back. They didn't have the sake that my husband wanted, that they had the first time."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Not great but fine.  However, I take my son to Teppanyaki restaurants for a relaxed, entertaining dining experience. We went on a Tuesday at about 5:00, the place was nearly empty, yet I felt incredibly rushed. 

The server sat us and asked what we wanted to drink. My four year old had some trouble making up his mind, so I asked her to come back.  She was back in less than two minutes, he finally decided and she asked if we were ready to order.  No, we hadn't even opened the menus.  

When decided and ordered.  The server brought our soups and salads both at the same time, that's fine, but she set them down just as the chef was coming to cook for us.  It was hard for my son to eat his soup and also enjoy the show put on by the chef, resulting in soup spilled everywhere.  Then the server brought the check while we still had plates half full of food.

At that point I wasn't even going to bother asking for dessert, I just got a box and told my son he could have a cookie at home.  I would like to say I am going to give this place another try, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Our server was new and very in experienced. He couldn't really answer our question and brought us too many soups and salads (only one meal came with it and he brought us 5 when no one else wanted them) sushi was warm not cold like it should be. Just didn't seem fresh."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday with a group of 7. No wait and it was empty at noon on a Sunday. We all ordered teppanyaki and waited about 20 minutes for the chef to come out to the table. The teppanyaki chef was great and put on a great show and even asked if we wanted certain pieces of fat cut off the meat. Food was pretty good and very standard with most teppanyaki restaurants for a reasonable price. I recommend the scallops and the filet cut of steak. The shrimp was pretty dry and flavorless. The main problem we ran into was our server. He was very neglectful of our table. He forgot to bring out any rice until we asked once our meal was almost over and we had to ask several times for water refills. Mind you the restaurant is empty at this point. I understand a couple mishaps but the waiter was fairly rude to my entire party. I would go back and hope for a different waiter."}
{"text":"I was really spoiled when I lived in San Jose, CA.  There was an abundance of great ethnic restaurants all over.  We had great pho, sushi, korean bbq, dim sum.....and it was easy to find.  In Chandler, not so much. 

We like Honmachi and we have been here several times.  The service is friendly and the sushi is pretty good.  Recently we had Teppanyaki.  My daughter loved watching the chef as he put on a show and prepared our food. It was a lot of food and delcious!  

I would give it 5 stars but we have been in a couple of times when the service was not so great.  Once we were seated and sat there for about 10 mins.  I had to flag someone down to wait on us.  They were short staffed that night and I can understand but servers walked by us several times while we sat with our menus and no water or drinks at all.  One other time the service was rather slow after our order was taken.  If I were dining on my own I probably would not care much.  I like a leisurely meal but I have a child that gets very impatient so lagging service is no good.  

Overall we like Honmachi and will continue to go back.  I get major sushi cravings that they can satisfy!"}
{"text":"I stopped with 2 of my friends for a \"quick\" lunch.  One lunch was served immediately, the other two took 45 minutes to arrive. The waitress was nice, but full of excuses that didn't get our meals to us any faster.  (BTW, the restaurant was not busy). No compensation for the wait was offered, and when we asked, were told no one on the premises had the authority to offer anything. We suggested someone call a manager.  Magically, a 50% discount became available. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had a good time. I came here to celebrate for my birthday and had a great time as well. We got a Groupon and the staff were super nice. The kids enjoyed themselves and I got to celebrate my birthday in a Tappan place...a win win!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews and we're a little hesitant going to Hon Machi, but I'm glad we decided to go. The service was great and food delicious. We just moved to chandler and this place is now our go to place."}
{"text":"This was pretty bad. First the hostess was put off by us. She didn't understand that we wanted to have a table for dinner. Then the server didn't understand our order. She also forgot to bring out our diet coke. The placemats didn't look clean. I don't know if it was the kitchen's fault or the server's fault but we got our entrees before our appetizers. The birthday song was really obnoxious a few tables over because they pulled out a big drum that was way too noisy. (Honestly nobody likes the birthday song except the people in your party at your table. Restaurants should stop doing it completely. A more special birthday present would be either a discount or a free dessert without the song.) Finally, some of the meat on my plate was undercooked and some of it was partially burnt. It looked like there was only one server for a huge section, and I felt bad for her."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi eater and the sushi here is terrible. Everything has crab meat - even a basic salmon roll. No asparagus or wasabi aioli, etc. Teppan was decent. No fancy show but not bad"}
{"text":"Great, reasonably priced sushi! The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating for allergies and special requests. Haven't had a chance to try anything else yet, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Hon Machi for my sons birthday and had an absolute blast.  The food is consistently good there. But, the restaurant itself needs a good cleaning. Chairs were dirty, windows were dirty and sills were dirty.  It makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. 
The teppanyaki chefs are always fun and entertaining. Just wish it was cleaner."}
{"text":"Went there for my sons birthday.  Food was excellent.  Drink server was new and a little slow.  This can be understood with anyone new. He made up for it  in personality.  Plan on dropping a C note as this place is not cheap but well worth it."}
{"text":"So far the food has been consistent, which is one of my peeves. 

I have tried the Tempura Appetizer Mango Salad 

Bento Boxes for wife, 
Chicken Yakisoba for me along with Turo Roll \"I Think\" Cucumber rolled around rice, yellow tail, n few other items topped with salmon eggs. Delicious, def my fave.

Worth the time n money for sure,,"}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the service was so slow and the entire staff ignored us as we sat there for 30 min trying to get our bill"}
{"text":"Walked into eat dinner tonight and the place was not that busy but my gf and I stood at the front for 10 minutes no one even came to seat us so we said forget it and went to Zoe's kitchen across the parking lot service here is terrible from my one experience can't even say a word to us with in 10 minutes of arriving and no one else waiting to be seated in front of us oh well one star for you!"}
{"text":"Hon Machi is without a doubt in my top 5 favorite places to eat and go-to restaurants for celebrating special events!! The food was/is always amazing, tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection! I dont know where these poor service reviews are coming from??? I eat here regularly and the service was once again EXCELLENT on this visit!! Our chef was very entertaining and I feel bad for them when the patrons do not engage and interact because when they do... it makes for a very special pre-dining experience. Yes, its the same \"stick\" every time, but their performance does not grow old to me. *Note: if you have never eaten teppanyaki, be aware it can be a little pricey as you are paying for top quality, fresh ingredients prepared to your liking at your table. I tend to order the lobster and fillet mignon and my wallet does take a bit of a hit, but in my opinion its worth ever penny!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for sushi and the food and the value are great especially during their happy hour specials and lunch specials.  There are lots of sushi choices in and around Chandler but this one is the best all around value.  Some may have slightly better food but not much better and you can't beat the specials."}
{"text":"Had sushi here 2 times and it tasted alright for the most part, though the fish tasted a bit \"fishy\" not very fresh, and the ginger had a weird forresty taste or as if it had fermented for a while. BOTH times I got bad stomach aches and got the squirts! THE FOOD HERE IS NOT FRESH IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night and we were in the mood for sushi and yakisoba so we decided to finally hit up the local spot we drive by whenever we go to Sprouts.  We walk in and wait five minutes or so before anyone approaches us to have us take a seat.  (The place wasn't all that busy, so the wait seemed unnecessary.)  Keeping an open mind and seeing the teppanyaki tables we took a seat and waited for our waitress.  She approaches us and asks us in a rushed voice what we want, we didn't know yet so she rushed off without allowing us to ask any questions.  She comes back a few minutes later and sees us holding our menu and asks as well as answers her own question of if we are ready to order and walks off again.  Now I feel a bit peeved but my husband suggest we just wait it out.  Well we waited another ten minutes before she came back.  We place our order for vegetarian sushi and yakisoba.  She returns promptly to tell us they are out of yakisoba so we said okay, lets get the sushi and see if we want anything else.  About five minutes later she comes back to tell us the chef is too busy and won't make us the sushi we requested.  She asked us if we wanted anything else off the menu and we just stood up and left.  

I really dislike giving bad reviews but this place was a total fail in terms of customer service. I was hoping it would have been a fun local spot to enjoy  but I doubt I'll ever go back.

Summary: Not a good spot for those with dietary restrictions (i.e. vegetarians)"}
{"text":"I always have an appetite for good Sushi and found this place on Groupon. They have a great selection on rolls that are all to die for. I have gone to many different sushi places in AZ and this is definitely in my top 3!Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality, fresh sushi!!"}
{"text":"I dined at this place twice with the hope the first time was just an off experience for me.  Both times the place felt dirty.  Floors sticky and the restaurant smelled like the grease trap needed to be emptied and cleaned.  The service was friendly both times, but the happy hour value isn't there which reflected the empty period.  It's not a true happy hour and the description not the same as online.  Food during regular dinner menu is alright...not great.  Food value also not there.  Super thin slices of sashimi.  Again, the empty crowd during dinner hour.  I highly doubt this restaurant will make it.  When a seafood restaurant is not busy, it's hard to keep the orders fresh."}
{"text":"Terrible. There were very few people in the restaurant and still terrible service. I ordered sushi rolls that had so little actual fish in it that some of the pieces you couldn't even see the fish part in the roll. It was extremely over priced for a dinner that consisted of 99% rice. They are obviously not doing well and are cutting corners to decrease costs, but that isn't going to gain them new clientele, only drive people away."}
{"text":"Have been to this place before. Food was good. Came in with a groupon today. Asked specifically what it covered. Attempted to order from regular menu with groupon for my wife, friend and I, and my son was going to ordered from the lunch menu for himself. We were told that this was not allowed at the same table. Trying to explain again our intent, the restaurant refused, despite the fact that items on the groupon were significant. We got up and left. Went to Rock Lobster, aka The Sushi Room."}
{"text":"This is the best teppanyaki I've found in the valley...and I've searched. The sushi is always excellent as well - high quality. 

Next time you are thinking Benihana, try this place instead - it's higher quality, and they actually have fire on the grill...the chefs are always entertaining."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying some of my favorite food is teppanyaki. I've been to many local & chain teppanyaki places in my life and this one isn't one I'll likely be back to. The service was slow and the food was subpar for the prices. I had the shrimp tempura as an app and it was horrible & the fried rice just tasted weird. We ordered filet & it was the fattiest filet I've ever had. Overall it wasn't something I'd recommend if you love teppanyaki. The bright side was that we used a groupon & sat next to a wonderful couple & their kids and enjoyed getting know their family."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with the kids today. The chef was quiet however was very nice and got the job done. Kenzie got the shrimp, me and Jacob got the steak. I also ordered the fried tofu. The appetizer came out while he was making our food so it wasn't horrible timing. The waitress was super sweet and was very attentive. We left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I love sushi!! and I love all your can eat sushi for $20!! The sushi chefs here are always awesome... my boyfriend and I go and CHOW DOWN.  They have some awesome rolls, and always get them out quickly. 

Hon Machi is teppan, sushi and I believe they have regular menu items like teriyaki chicken.  I can only review the sushi bar because that is all I have ever gone for. I give 4 stars because it seems like they have a high turnover on wait staff, and they always seem to be training.  After one roll they tried to take my ginger and wasabi! ha! no worries though! 

So many options of rolls for the all you can eat (I wish squid salad was part of it!) I really like the tootsy roll, Arizona roll, and shrimp tempura. My boyfriend loves that nigiri is part of the all you can eat which isnt part of the happy hour. 

I love this place, we go every couple of weeks.  All you can eat is Sunday-Wednesday.  I would love to try the teppan there once because people seem to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and decided to do a little research on nearby sushi restaurants. Hon Machi is right down the street from where I live so I decided to look at their online menu. On their website it specifically states that Happy Hour is from 3 pm-6 pm. However, after dining at the restaurant I was charged full price. I brought this to the attention of the hostess and she just said that the website is wrong and their Happy Hour is from 5 pm-6 pm. Why wasn't this communicated to me before when I ordered off of the Happy Hour menu that she gave me? It's too bad because the food was good and the guys making the sushi were excellent. I almost feel like I was purposely deceived just so I would have to pay full price. So my intentions of paying a little over $10 for a meal turned into a $20 meal. Not a great way to impress first time guests. Unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"First...buying sushi in the desert is a sketchy proposition at best.

With that said we ordered sushi platter and some sort of teriyaki steak.

Steak was actually pretty good

Sushi was serviceable, but nothing special

Overall not bad."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on Sunday...total drive-by. WOW! Originally we set out to visit Yogi Teriyaki - and they're closed on Sunday?!! We had the Bento Combos 1 & 2 and the green tea. The Miso soup was tasty, and the house salad has a delicious dressing. Teriyaki Chicken was tender and full of flavor, the tempura was hot and crunchy (I like), sashimi was ok, the sushi was yum, even though it was only California roll. The Bento Combos were really quite artful, wish I'd taken a photo. I'm going back soon to really try the sushi - they've got quite a selection. This place gets points for Japanese atmosphere, and also the impossibly attractive hostess and server, who were both very knowledgeable of all the items on the menu - regular James Bond-style Supervixens! Dig the menu item pics, the prices are not unreasonable, and if you like Teppanyaki they have big table seating around the grills, as well as booths, regular tables, and sushi bar seating."}
{"text":"Was there for a late lunch the other day around 1pm in order to check the place and use my Groupon (again, I know).  

I was pretty much the only one in the restaurant so I got quick service and full attention. 

The waiter, Andrew, recommended the New Orleans roll as one of his preferred roll. I decided to order 3 hand rolls (Spicy salmon, scallops and yellow tail) on top of the New Orleans. 

I got the hand rolls first and they were big and delicious but I thought that for $6 a piece they had to as I usually pay $3.50 or so for the same elsewhere. Then the New Orleans came. It made me thinking that I did the right choice ordering hand rolls rather than rolls but it could be me and my likings too. This one felt pretty blend comparing to what I got before and the tuna on top was a bit tasteless. 

I like when all the flavors create some kind of a firework in your mount but this one was far from it. At least it was crunchy, so I got the noise from the firework without the show, a bit disappointed there. In my mind I could have used another hand roll, oh well.

I ended up paying $2 plus tip which wasn't bad when you consider the Groupon ($30). I guess I will give it another shot next time I can grab another discount but for now I'm still chewing on this last toll."}
