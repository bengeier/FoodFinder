{"text":"Decided to try a different jerk eatery as I normally go to annie's at Jane and Annette (which is pretty good by the way). This place offers a plentiful menu and everything is made in-house and fresh. Service was very quick. Only minor complaint is it's located near a very busy intersection. There is a small paid parking lot directly opposite."}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken. Nice clean food made with love. Sides were outstanding. Had jerk chicken, rice, mashed potatoes and plantain. Owner/chef on side was very nice to deal with. Finally we have a great Caribbean option for take out in the Junction."}
{"text":"I went to taste seduction today with a friend for lunch.  I can't possibly say enough about how great it is. The owner/chef served us and was so delightful from the moment we stepped through the door. I ordered the jerk chicken Mac and cheese which was delicious. It is a very big order foe the price and tasted great.  I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"From the warm greeting and great customer service to the delicious meal, this restaurant deserves 5/5. I ordered the jerk chicken which came with rice and some fried veggies. The chicken was juicy and flavourful and the veggies so good that I may opt for less or nice rice and more veggies. I can't wait to go back to try their jerk shrimp with fettucine!!!"}
{"text":"I live about 75 metres from Taste Seduction and often smell the delicious aromas wafting from their place from my balcony.  Finally got to try it tonight and what a treat.  The Jerk Chicken was perfectly seasoned and just falls right off the bone like butter and the reggae rice was outstanding.   Also tried the Jerk Shrimp Tacos which were also delicious, although a little light on the portion size for $12.  I'll definitely be back, probably weekly."}
{"text":"I ordered their curry goat with Boldt potatoes and their oxtail with reggae rice. The flavour of the curry was quite nice (only reason I gave this review 2 stars) but also very oily. There were a LOT of bones and very little meat. The oxtail also had mainly bone with very little meat. Oxtail was bland and texture was tough and chewy not at all tender, the way oxtail should be. The Reggae rice was dried out as if it had been sitting all day. It too lacked flavour. I  grew up on Caribbean food so it's unfortunate when you receive bland oily food from a local restaurant. I will not be ordering from Taste Seduction again."}
{"text":"Very good. I go to the gym around the corner. After a long work out I was not in the mood to cook dinner, so I thought I would give It a shot. Very good!"}
{"text":"Man, this is as good as it gets for a small take out joint.  I have re-visited since the beginning and they added $7 lunch specials to the menu.  My wife and I tried one each.  And man, for $7, the quality of food is unbeatable!  The portion size is very good as well for that price.  This will now be my regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Incredible jerk chicken tacos. Great flavour and spice. The Ting topped it all off. I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"I hate places like this. You try it, you like it, you have to come back to try every item, then the restaurant gets popular then you're waiting longer for your food then you get pissed and go to A&W. Sigh.  Just FINESSED the jerk chicken fettuccine, was bomb. Definitely try it. Debating on trying the tacos next or the shrimp pesto pasta. FML... decisions decisions."}
{"text":"I've passed Taste Seduction often and wondered who goes to such an obscure restaurant in a rather obscure location. It wasn't until another Junction restaurant, Honest Weight, gave it a glowing recommendation that we decided it to give it a try. We were not disappointed.   First time around we tried an assortment of tacos. Chicken, shrimp and fish, and each was amazing. We were impressed enough that we gave it a second go, this time including the Jerk Chicken Chow Mein and simply put - wow! Not only was the Chow Mein amazing, but the tacos seemed to get even better than the first time!   Given its location and limited seating, we've been ordering via UBEREATS. It's been getting her in good time and in good shape. Thank you Taste Seduction for the good food and thanks to Honest Weight for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Located a few doors north of Dundas West @Keele, Taste Seduction is perhaps the best Jamaican style restaurant in the city. Vernon, the owner and chef, has worked in different kitchens and critically acclaimed hotels, so he certainly has the passion for good food. I think most people only assume that, since most of the menu is Jamaican focused with the exception of shrimp tacos, mac & cheese, fettuccine with shrimp, you'd think that's all on offer. The Chef also does catering and is available for private bookings. The restaurant has a good vibe and is always clean. If you have the lucky opportunity to meet his wife, you will fall in love with this place. Usually, his oldest and youngest sons help out in the kitchen and they keep the good vibes going. The food is excellent. The chef only makes fish escabeche to order and has a limited supply of fresh fish each day. It generally sells out by 8pm, so be sure to call ahead to avoid disappointment. When you go there, don't worry about what to order, just ask Vernon to recommend something to you. I have tried almost everything but shrimp(allergy). I like his braised oxtail with triple mashed potatoes. The oxtail just falls off the bone. Jerk chicken with reggae rice(basmati with saffron) is my personal favorite, and since I don't like my food spicy, it has the right amount of flavors. If you are in #thejunction, be sure to stop by. Even people from San Francisco and Australia have visited Taste Seduction."}
{"text":"I ordered from here a few days ago off uber eats. Saw they had jerk chicken Mac and cheese so I decided to give it a try. First of all let me say that it did not look like anything from the photo. Now onto the taste.. or lack there of.. the macaroni was cooked well but the cheese they used was just terrible. It had no flavour to it. It was like eating chalk. Now onto the disappointment of what they call jerk chicken. Now of course they can't give you full pieces of chicken so it's almost like they pulled pork but chicken, which is fine... BUT that was definitely NOT jerk chicken my god it had NO jerk flavour to it. The only thing that had the flavour was the little pieces of skin that was in there. HIGHLY disappointed with the meal. I didn't even end up finishing it because it had no taste. I'm sorry but I've had some really good jerk chicken that has flavour through the skin ( RAPS on eglinton) but this was just a let down. I will never order from this place again. I waste of $15"}
{"text":"So delicious! I usually get the mashed potatoes and jerk chicken, it's so good! Really fresh! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. But this place has amazingly flavourful dishes, charming service and a cool location. The ingredients are fresh and expertly prepared. Why would you go across the street to insult your stomach at A&W when Taste Seduction is right nearby. Locally owned and operated. A pleasure to support this fine local business."}
