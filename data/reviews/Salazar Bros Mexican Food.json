{"text":"It was late on Sunday and stopped at Amados for menudo...they were out so I and the caravan behind me headed to Salazar's...They had it and boy was it fantastic...a little more spice would be okay with me...I continue to return for their breakfast burritos so good!!!"}
{"text":"The streak and egg breakfast burrito is simply perfect. Go for the red sauce to kick things up a notch. For dinner, try the \"special burrito\" for something a little different. The service is always snappy too. It's the perfect neighborhood burrito joint."}
{"text":"My work orders from here on the regular;  so whereas, I'm not fully versed on the entire menu, I can give my two cents on the items I have tried.    Ground beef street tacos:  Now, I am very much a crispy taco gal, but I will make an exception for these!  Simple and tasty;  gr beef, onions, lettuce, cheese.  I could easily lose track and eat half a dozen of these.  A staff favorite.  Personally, I LOVE the 'Flying Saucer,' which is like a loaded tostada.  Crispy flour(?) tortilla topped with beans, seasoned shredded beef (SO GOOD), pico, lettuce and cheese.  Probably 6-7\" diameter.  It's a lot for 1 person to eat, but I manage.  As I mentioned previously, I order food frequently for the staff here at work, so when I call in an order it's usually for 20+ tacos, etc.  The order is always ready for pickup in 10-15 min, hot and fresh.  The friendly service, efficiency, and quality of food earn these 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for many years and I've had a great experience every time. We eat here at least once a week and always get delicious food and awesome service. I would recommend to anyone craving some yummy Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a 5 star experience here to date.  Can't believe this place is rated this highly.  I've been trying to give them a chance to impress me since they first opened their doors but so far it's nothing but very average Mexican food.  Before writing this review I thought I'd visit them one more time since it had been awhile. Maybe somethings changed I thought.  Nope...still extremely average and not worth driving cross town for but if you're in the area and hungry then go for it.  Yesterdays choice was a carnitas burro and a order of super nachos.   My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food.  In my opinion you can usually judge a Mexican food place by the salsa that arrives with your chips before you order. If they can't make a good salsa you can pretty much be assured the rest of your experience will match the salsa experience.  That being said this place has the most flavorless salsa I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Salazar Bros is a hidden gem along the Chandler/Tempe border in east valley.  I first tried Salazar Bros about a month ago based on other yelpers reviews and have not been disappointed to this point.  The location is a little hidden and plain, but you cant judge a book by its cover because they more than make up for it with their great food.  I've made 5 trips to Salazar Bros and have tried the following:  Caldo de Res - 3 out of 5 stars, this is a simple Mexican soup with complex flavors derived from the simple ingredients.  The soup was a little salty but still delicious   Rolled Tacos with Guacamole - 4 out of 5 stars, excellent choice at a low price  Egg and Chorizo Burrito - 5 out of 5 stars, competitors overload this dish with way too much chorizo and you end up with a greasy mess that can ruin your shirt.  Salazar Bros has the recipe down, its a perfect balance of egg and chorizo on a very tasty flour tortilla.  You cant go wrong with this item to start your busy day with.  Overall, I rate them high for their low prices and great food.  Treat them well yelpers."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they first opened many years ago with the Salazar brothers! First they were on Southern and 48th Street, then on 48th Street and Baseline...now on McClintock and Rural. We love their bomburro burritos with no Pico de gallo, shredded beef tacos, and taquitos! Great workers, great prices, great red sauce and we have been followers ever since! We will continue to follow them and recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"I went to Salazar Bros because of the reviews I read here, and I was not very impressed... Its just like a Filberto's, nothing about it was unique. I ordered a chimi and it was ok - just ok. Nothing to rave about, but a quick fix if you're looking for cheap/fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Arizona.  Salazar Brothers is back and better than ever.  They reopened at Guadalupe and Rural in a stand alone building on the northeast corner.  The oil is vegetable oil and they serve breakfast items all day.  Some off the menu items include rice bean and cheese burrito, potato tacos .   The food is very good very clean I eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"The best nachos and steak burrito ever!! Definitely a weekend ritual to stop by here!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I have gone here for 3-4 years. We originally went to the location on Baseline, then they shut down and moved. We found them again here and I must say this is a way better location and set up for the place. The people here are FANTASTIC and they deserve some dang recognition! Everyone is so friendly and nice and the environment feels cozy and casual. Some days they will have the big screen on at the register to watch some sports games while they work and it's amusing, I love it. The prices here are super cheap but you get a good amount of food and it's good quality too! We have had too many things off their menu but the top 4 we go back to is the super fries (which has beans in it!!!!), the fish taco meal, California burrito ( which you can order with fries and avacado in it for extra, it's really good), and the rolled tacos meal. Not once have we ever had a bad experience here. The Jamaica always tastes great, I got my roommate hooked on that drink. Overall, this place is awesome and I am sad that I am no longer in Arizona to go eat here but anytime I visit again... I will be stopping by this amazing place. Keep doing what you are doing guys!!!! Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service . they really seem to appreciate and enjoy your business . plus the borders is amazing . s"}
{"text":"This place is the best ever! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The new location they have a drive thru. Its a great option to have. This is not a chain restaurant, family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Like a Filibertos but better quality ingredients.  Nothing spectacular but I have not had anything to complain about either."}
{"text":"We loved the green chili burrito. Yum!!! Fast friendly service and awesome food!! With the red salsa had more flavor but otherwise yum!!"}
{"text":"Good food good prices. Order at the counter or drive through. Clean inside and friendly. The place is easy to pass up because you can drive by to quickly. So slow down and try it out you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has bad customer service. The one lady that do the orders is very rude. The food it's okay, but the serving size and portions of food is very little for the money you pay. They don't have a salsa bar or chips. On the other hand Pulibertos Taco Shop on baseline and hardy has better customer service, atmosphere, salsa bar, chips, and a much more serving size in their orders for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Without question the best Mexican food in the area. Try the adobadda burrito add bacon, thank me later. Carne, pork, fish everything taste fresh and clean. You will not be disappointed. Much better than anything around."}
{"text":"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.    I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.    The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.  I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos."}
{"text":"GREEN CHILI BURRITO!  Everything is good.  The place is clean.  The staff treats you like family.  People on here bitch because there's no \"salsa bar with chips\"....who cares....they make up for it with awesome food.  Check the place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Drogas!  This place is insane. So good!  I stopped in for the carne asada plate...tasty, tender beef, delicious creamy guac, savory refried beans, perfect pico and a delicious warm tortilla that tastes homemade. And best of all,  very generous portions.   I split my pants.   Definitely give them a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent prices and the people working there are friendly. CLEAN inside unlike other Mexican rest's in the area. The taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food every time & fast. Mini Tacos for a buck each can't be beaten with a stick. The meats are all tasty & the tortillas fresh. Mmm mmm good! This is definitely a quick, good, cheap place to eat. Best mini tacos I've had outside of Cali."}
{"text":"This is a typical Mexican fast food place but great taste and quality.  Tried the chicken tacos plate and it was tasty and delicious. Prices are very reasonable as well (less than 10 bucks for a plate and a drink).  Better food than Filibertos (the place is very similar to Filibertos but better food).  Dining area and service were quite good as well.  Will return and try it as much and as frequent as I can."}
{"text":"This is one of my fail safe hole-in-the-wall eateries. They are consistently good and fast, as a matter of a fact I used to eat here even when they were on Southern Ave. All the breakfast burritos are huge and flavorful. Superb rolled tacos and sauce (although I wish they had more meat inside their still darn good). The service is friendly and they keep the tables pretty clean (unless you go during lunch rush at which that point it becomes an utter zoo). Better than Filliberto's and won't give you gas afterwards. Plus they are cheap- long live $5 lunches!"}
{"text":"Their bean and cheese burritos are awesome and great when I had a mexican food cravings. Their horchata is outta this world, especially when I've been without it for a while. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada burritos. Had a coworker that introduced me to Salazar's back in 2005 when it was still in Phoenix. Found out recently that it was now located in Tempe. Still as good as I remember it. Also, try out the Carne Asada fries! (Super Fries). They are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Salazar is my secret spot when I NEED tacos. Their beef tacos with salsa verde are crave-able. Amazing. Order one more taco than you think you want. You deserve it.  They need fresh brewed iced tea and then they would get a 5 star rating. I'm talking to you Salazar Bros! Iced tea."}
{"text":"I don't understand how Filiberto's stays in business, and this excellent place is forced to bounce from location to location. One benefit of a new building: the cleanest eating area and kitchen I've ever seen in a taco shop. You could eat fondue off the ground here. The food is excellent, too, leaps and bounds over the chains. A great little place to quench that taco craving."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! My guilty lunch pleasure this review is for the food and drive thru. I like the convenience of the drive thru location, I've also never been stuck waiting for over 5 minutes at the drive thru (major plus, when I'm hungry). The food is always warm, fresh, and satisfying."}
{"text":"The Best place to get a Shrimp Cocktail, Mexican Style!  The Carne Asada Tacos are Excellent too!  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  There is also a drive-through window..."}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Phoenix we have to eat here! They moved from 48th and Baseline, but some great food and service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food at such great prices. The menudo is delicious, big portions and amazing flavor. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I liked this Mexican place some good Mexican foods, some okay, and other maybe okay. I been here for couples times and considered maybe be back here and maybe not in the near future! They are have some good deal or discount for lunches sometimes! This deal might made me be back here sometimes in the near future!  I truly recommend, if you liked some Mexican foods!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's my go to place for spicy cheap eats! Always, great food with service that's fast and friendly! I've been coming here for so long that she knows my order, and chuckles because she knows I am going to order my usual quesadilla with jalapenos and a carne asada mini taco. (which comes with two corn tortillas so I always make two tacos out of it as not to wear it) The quesadilla is made from a huge soft tortilla, the jalapenos are fresh and spicy and it it smothered and melted into cheese perfection. The carne asada taco is filled with flavor and covered in pico de gallo & guacamole. They have great tasting red and green sauce if you want to add more heat, of course I always do.  It's the perfect place to go if your craving something quick and spicy!"}
{"text":"My go to super fast Mexican food place!  I am kinda of addicted to their food. Drive thru is super fast and everything seems to be pretty fresh. I might have to go tomorrow !   It's new so I haven't had to deal with a long line - hopefully they keep up with their great customer service!"}
{"text":"I would say that this place is pretty equal to filibertos. With the exception of the names of a few items, the menu is the same and prices are about the same as well.   My fav is always the carne asada fries which are known as \"super fries\" here. Fries were good and came with a generous amount of meat. Slightly less greasy than the ones at filibertos.   This place also has some really great churros with unique flavors! I had the strawberry cream one!  I would return!"}
{"text":"Beyond better quality food than Filibertos and Los Favoritos. Ever. I'm never going back to those places. I wish Salazar had more locations.  I highly recommend this place for Mexican fast food.   The people there are great and super friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I've been going here regularly for the past five or six years.  They've recently changed their name, but the menu and taste remains the same.  Get the Bombero if you want a mouthful of awesomeness.  UPDATE: Salazar got bought out and re-branded a while ago.  The food is now of inconsistent quality.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's booty.  I occasionally roll the dice, but times sure have changed.  UPDATE #2: A friend let me know that the official Salazar Bros lives again, this time at 48th St and Baseline.  Back to 5 stars, you go.  Easily the best of the Mexican fast food joints."}
{"text":"Camilo O does a great job of summing up Salazar Brothers, it just doesn't exemplify how much better the food is than F-B's.  The food here is unbelievably cheap, and is made very quickly.  More importantly it tastes great as well.  I usually go with the Chicken Tostada when I go here.  I used to always grab a taco or two to go along with it (also quite good), but after having leftovers every time I've found that unless I'm starving, the ridulously-cheap $2.15 tostada is totally sufficient.  Two bucks for a huge heaping pile of lettuce, salsa, chicken, and beans!  The environment is just like any other quick-stop Mexican shop, not quite as clean cut as Los Taquitos but not bad by any means.  If you're in the area it's probably the best spot around to grab a bite and run!"}
{"text":"Great decent Mexican food that we found open late at our new apartment. Nice gentlemen working at what seemed to be a rather dead time of the evening. Even let us attempt our butchered. Spanglish when ordering.  Burrito had good meat and tasty onions and bell peppers"}
{"text":"Tried Salazar Bros. for the first time.  Service was great and friendly.  The prices were average to Filiberto's or the like.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  I ordered the Chorizo and eggs breakfast platter.  The chorizo was very bland and dry and the rice and beans are just OK.  I ordered 3 rolled tacos with guacamole as well and those were tasty.  Would I eat here again?  I would but with Filiberto's just a mile away, that would be my first choice."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Super clean. They are always cleaning.  I noticed the fresh plants and friendly service. I would take my grandmother there  10 stars"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. The taquitos were ok, nothing special about them or the guacamole. Tried the carne asada, adobada, and tripe mini tacos. Carne asada is fine and the adobada was a bit bland. As for the tripe, I'm not used to drier tripe in my tacos.   Overall, it was fine by takeout standards. Wouldn't be my first choice, I'm going to continue to look elsewhere for a good taco/Mexican takeout place."}
{"text":"Ehhhh it's not horrible but nothing special. I got a fish burrito and it was over cooked and mushy. I live down the street about 2 minutes but think it's worth the extra drive to go to Amados down the road."}
{"text":"I come here atleast once a month, and I'm never disappointed. The staff is super friendly and nice! And the food is delicious! I always get a California burrito or Carne Asada fries and I haven't ever gotten sick! Their food isn't greasy which is good!"}
{"text":"At its core,  another \"bertos\" type format - you know what?   When I'm away from home and miss my 'bertos, what I really miss is this place right here."}
{"text":"This is going to be my go to when craving Mexican food. I got the 2 chicken tacos and the chicken was moist and very juicy not dry at all. The chicken tacos had diced tomatoes, onions and bell peppers. Really delicious! Didn't really care too much for the rice and beans."}
{"text":"Best burrito spot in the area, much better than amados or filibertos. Everything is really fresh. Green salsa is off the hook."}
{"text":"These are some of the best breakfast burritos in town! The tortillas are incredibly fresh, and they are filled to the brim! Prices are extremely reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the very first time yesterday. Not bad for a drive-thru Mexican food place. I will give them time though before I try it again. Why? Because I know they just recently opened at this location and the food was okay but not super spectacular.. Like every place, they need time to \"get the bugs out\", so to speak.  I will say this about their customer service: top notch! Very friendly people and you can clearly hear them over their loudspeaker, not like at their competitor's place, where you have to scream to be heard and also make them repeat themselves over and over."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Salazar's for some time now . They have some great Carne Asada burritos , and rolled tacos . They also have combination plates . Try the California Burrito if you get a chance ."}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for something quick.  This place seemed to get decent reviews, so we stopped.  First, they need to turn the A/C up.  It was seriously warm in there!  I'll skip the preliminaries and get to it.  My wife ordered the caldo de res, and I ordered #6 (burrito and enchilada combo).  Probably waited about five minutes before the burrito was ready, and maybe another five for the caldo de res.  My wife had to replace the caldo de res.  It was way too salty.  I mean almost like sea water salty.  I tried it also, and it was way too much.  To their credit they took it back and offered her something else.  She opted for the carnitas.  So how was the carnitas?  It was dry pork.  Not moist.  No seasoning.  Just dry pork.  Her refried beans were like what you'd get from a can.  The rice was so mild it may as well have been white rice.  Adding their red salsa helped it a bit, but still weak.  The enchilada was cheddar cheese in a tortilla.  That's it.  I should have asked up-front.  I'm not a fan of cheese enchiladas, but this was just an oily cheddar cheese (with more cheddar on top).  So even by cheese enchilada standards this was not good. The one saving grace was that the burrito was good.  Simple, but very good.  The burrito saved them from a one-star rating.  Well, give them credit for replacing the very salty caldo de res, too.  If I had ordered only the burrito I'd probably have gone with three stars.  Everything else was sub-par.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week.  The food is good....the service is fast and it's a good value for the money you spend.  We love this family owned business."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and their food isn't greasy! I love their green chili beef and chicken enchiladas, so good! They put grilled onions and green peppers in their tacos and enchiladas which is unusual and a nice touch. This is my go to place for quick Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I love this place something fierce.  The steak in the California burrito is deliciously seasoned, and Salazar's has the best Bean and Cheese Burrito on the planet."}
{"text":"It sure is a hole in the wall joint, but the food is spectacular and the price is right. I've eaten there twice in the past two weeks, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The 12 rolled tacos with guac and cheese for around $6.40 was delicious, and I could only eat half. For breakfast this morning I had a steak and chorizo breakfast burrito. For $4, it was huge and fully loaded with plenty of well seasoned meat. You cannot go wrong having a meal here."}
{"text":"Not too bad for Mexican fast food. The obvious comparison is Filibertos and they are similar. One thing I have to complain about are the tiny and cheap utensils they give you to eat with. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this place! Their breakfast burritos are the best I have found in Phoenix, their service is always great, and no matter what I order from here it's good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Salazar Brothers for almost 9 years. They moved locations on me once but i tracked them down. I've yet to be disappointed with their food or their service. The prices are great and the food is even better. Great family owned business that I will always support."}
{"text":"This place is a less greasy version of Filiberto's. The guy at the drive-thru is always friendly and the service is quick but not sloppy. Prices are reasonable! The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Easily the best beef burritos I've ever had! 2 large burritos with two sides of rice for $7.50 is hard to beat (I'm looking at you chipotle). I am going to take a nap after only finishing one of the burritos, I look forward to choosing down on the second this evening. Fantastic food, I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I used to work near there other location and when it closed and said they were moving I hoped to be able to find. Then while driving home one day from work I saw the new location, and boy was I happy, its within my work commute and close enough to make a regular lunch time stop.   I stopped one morning on the way to work and was happy to see they have a drive thru, I ordered a egg, potato and cheese burrito and had pico de gallo added to it. I have to say it was a great tasting breakfast burrito.  A few days later I met up with my friend for lunch and I ordered the #20, it's a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, this did not disappoint! So good!    I'm pleased to see Salazar Bros back, its great seeing everyone, and loving the new spot!"}
{"text":"Best friend and I went to Salazar Brothers for lunch today; it is one of our fav lunch time places. I haven't been in awhile and am glad we chose this place today. I ordered the #20 which was a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, now I'm not a huge fan on refried beans, but today the beans were great! The burrito was packed with meat, guacamole & Pico de Gallo, very flavorful and yummy! Best friend ordered 2 asada tacos & cheese quesadilla with jalapenos. If you're a fan of really hot sauce that scorches your tongue then they might leave you lacking in the heat, but their red hot sauce is favorable and not tomato saucy like some places it's just missing the heat.    Great food for lunch at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Went here for two breakfast burritos the service was good the burritos were made very well and tasted great.  I have not been back to try anything else but sure will be in the near future."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place, especially for breakfast!  If you have a hankering for a breakfast burrito, look no further than Salazar Bros.  We ordered the potato egg and cheese and added bacon to them.  Each burrito is huge so order one and split it if you aren't ravenously hungry.  I love their tortillas.  As a self proclaimed bean expert, their beans pass muster.  The inside is extremely clean, which usually means that the kitchen is also kept just as clean."}
{"text":"Now this is Mexican food! Best I've had in the Phoenix area. Ordered the taco salad & the carne was seasoned perfectly! The chips were great & the salsa was fresh! My husband ordered a burrito & it was ginormous! I will be coming back."}
{"text":"if only I could give this place zero stars! The chicken was stale and smelled bad! Chimichamga was worst and ruined our dinner experience! Dont waste your money dining here."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD!!! Very fresh and they're always friendly and nice. I think 3 brothers own it. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"We got take-out and it was delicious! We had the red chili burrito, green chili burrito and the carnitas burrito and split them. We also got chips and guac...the guac comes on the chips which was fine, but i would have preferred it on the side. The carnitas burrito was the best, followed by the green chili, then the red. Everything was so fresh and flavorful.  The place was clean and the staff were friendly...we will definitely eat here again! Great prices too."}
{"text":"This place is very good, definately worth going!! We got the carne asada and adobada with fresh guacamole. Only small business!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting Salazar's and the breakfast burrito is fantastic. Ran to the car to grab something after ordering and my food was ready when I came back inside. Ordered chips & salsa and it was served hot in a Styrofoam box. The pico de gallo was fresh and plentiful and wonderfully cool with the hot tortillas chips.  Although I had every intention to save half the giant burrito my taste buds overruled my plans and every last bit was delicious."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst Mexican food I have had in Phoenix. Four of us all ordered different items and nobody liked anything"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos and tamales!!! All their food is delicious. I can eat there everyday  and I would recommend anyone looking for some good Mexican"}
{"text":"To put it simply, it's like Filiberto's but the food taste better.  Hierarchy of quick-service Mexican:  Los Taquitos is the best, then Salazar, THEN Filiberto's."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Salazar Bros over 10 years ago and just recently rediscovered it.  They are just as awesome now as they were then!  Great food, big portions at a very reasonable price.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is fast and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back...a lot!"}
{"text":"Always delicious fast Mexican food.  We have had a range of things that have always tasted fresh and very good flavors.  Their rolled tacos are filled with a lot of meat, rice and beans are really good authentic.  The green chile pork is a favorite as well, but so is the red chile.  Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.  You can eat there, which is really spacious and clean.  Or you can order the drive through which they're also pretty quick."}
{"text":"It's the best \"Mexican\" food restuarant in Tempe. It's quick and we have been going here for over 11 years now. My family has been loyal to this restuarant since they've moved locations 3 times now. I personally love their red sauce and bomburro burrito. Their taquitos and guacamole are amazing and so are their crunchy tacos. It's not traditional mexican food, butit's tasty and their soda is always fresh. I don't always eat Mexican-American food, but when I do, it's Salazar Bros!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with my gf and it's such a great experience each time. The staff is SO friendly, food is great. They are more than happy to tweak the menu for vegetarians and let you substitute anything you want instead of meat! Yeah there's no salsa bar, get over it. They have amazing pico and the same two salsas that amados and filibertos have so I'm not sure why people who frequent those places complain. Their tortillas are fresh and soft unlike the other two places mentioned who may as well wrap their burritos with printer paper. Lol love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Waited until I've eaten here a few times before leaving a review. Staff is so nice and friendly :-) food is large portions for dirt cheap prices! Just ordered a giant burrito and horchata for $4 and some change!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This place opened up a few months ago so I finally went in to give it a try. Walking in I notice its very nice and clean. The food was better than I expected. I had the 2 Carne Asada taco plate with beans and rice included. The tacos had pico de gallo and guacamole on them included. Everything was delicious. My boyfriend had the Shrimp Burrito which we asked if they would make it a Chimichanga and they did even though it wasn't on the menu. The Shrimp Chimichanga came with shrimp, rice, tartar sauce, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. He said it was amazingly good. We are definitely going back plus very close by to us."}
{"text":"Just grabbed two breakfast burritos one machaca for my wife and the other steak and eggs for myself. Both burritos are a little smaller then other places but when you bite into them they are hot off the grill. The steak and eggs could use a little flavor, i used both green and red salsa and i lile the red over the green but not by much. I felt the green didnt have any flavor at all and the red had a bit of spice to it but thats it. I gave thos place four stars one for how clean it was. One for friendliness of staff. One for quickness and one for not finding any pieces of fat in my steak like i have found in other places....gross. Other then that i will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"The interior is spacious and the winding vine plants that snake around the walls are impressive, but I wasn't too impressed with our to-go order.   I had a pollo asado burrito ($4.50) and tried some of the chorizo plate. The burrito was filled with a lot of small pieces of chopped meat, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Unfortunately the meat was so incredibly salty the only way I could eat it was to get out some of my own homemade guacamole and smother the burrito with it to disperse the salt. I also got a few burnt hard black pieces in my meal and some bits of gristle as I ate. I had a bite of the chorizo plate which was better, but consisted of a lot of egg with a small amount of chorizo flavor.   The prices are reasonable, they have a drive through and they are open late (Until 11 weekdays), but you could say the same thing about Filibertos, and they are actually open 24 hours and have better food. So for now I'll stick to Filibertos for my quickie fast food Mexican eats."}
{"text":"This small little eatery serves up huge breakfast burritos that are easy on your wallet. We shared a steak and eggs burrito (~$4) and a machaca and eggs burrito (~$3.50). The steak and egg burrito had a generous portion of meat and egg, with flavorful, thinly cut steak. I liked that the machaca had veggies in it such as tomato and onion, but I couldn't taste much of the machaca in the burrito, and the flavor of the other ingredients tended to drown out the beef.  They also have your standard fare such as enchiladas, various burritos, tacos, as well as menudo.   We also tried some horchata ($1.70 for large size). It was cool and refreshing.  Condiments are basic, and they have a tub of individually packaged green and red sauce for you to go with your meal.  Overall, the breakfast burritos were good, but my favorite choice for a breakfast burrito is still at Los Favoritos."}
{"text":"First I must start off by praising the Yelp Gods as without them and my fellow Yelpers this review would not be possible. I first visited Phoenix last October and stumbled  upon a place called Del Taco. I now have moved to Phoenix and went on the hunt for Del Taco only to discover that my GPS lead me to a closed establishment (super sad face) I hopped on Yelp to see if I could find another establishment that served Mexican Food and saw that this place had great reviews and were close so I decided to give them a try and I totally do not regret it!  Usually when I go places I do not expect super large portions. I ordered a chicken supreme quesadilla, chips and guacamole, and 2 strawberry churros. When the man handed me the bag I was shocked as it almost didn't fit into my driver's side window. I ordered dinner for 1, not a Mexican Thanksgiving feast which is exactly what I got along with very friendly service!  Upon arriving home and opening the behemoth of a bag I discovered that the owners must've lived in Chicago at some point in their lives and mimicked their quesadillas off of their pizza. The slices were so big that I wanted to fold them in half like Chicago Style pizza but instead I opted to use a fork instead. I could only eat one and the flavor was amazing. The taste was authentic and has erased the concept of Taco Bell from my mind. The guacamole was one of the hugest portions I have ever seen from an establishment. It looked like it was atleast 2 guacamoles placed on the chips and the flavor was great as well although I added just a tad of salt. The churros were to die for and have ruined me for life. All in all that place will likely become my new home for my Mexican cravings! I am beyond happy!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I had the Carne asada taco combo. For a fast food Mexican place I was impressed. The Carne asada was tender and had good flavor. A lot better than filabertos. I will defiantly come back to try the breakfast burritos next time."}
{"text":"The measure of a Mexican restaurant can be made by the quality of its beans. Salazar Bros is the closest you'll get to a home made Mexican meal. The beans are delicious, the carne asada perfectly cooked. Beware, you'll never be satisfied anywhere else."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall, very clean!! Nothing fancy and you order and pick up at the front counter! The food is outstanding - Carne Asada was super flavorful and tender!! Prices are very reasonable!! Fantastic food and don't be put off by the lack of ambiance but a good sign that it's authentic is the TV is playing in Spanish!I if the salsa was a little bit better and there was no Styrofoam plates I might give it five stars!"}
{"text":"First off the place is always spotless. Second, you will not find better chorizo anywhere. I'm completely addicted to it. The chorizo egg and cheese burrito will change your life. I love this place."}
{"text":"The carne asada is so tender, my wife loves their super asada fries. I usually get their shrimp burrito. I was saddened when I visited them on the last day at their previous location, I am very happy to see them back in business again. Their food is excellent, the restaurant is clean, they are very friendly.  What more could you ask for. :)"}
{"text":"They are back, and just as good as ever,  They are getting back on their feet after they lost the lease seven months ago to goodwill.  I am happy to once again provide them with my business."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and got a carnitas burrito to go.  Very tasty, and really good hot sauce too.  Great deal for $5.50, I will definitely be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"One night i decided to try this place because I live right down the street and didn't want Taco Bell! I wanted good authentic Mexican food without having to dine in and this is what I got at this place! I've tried different items on the menu and have not been disappointed! The food is nicely seasoned, the prices are good and the guy at the drive thru window is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! I've never had anything here that I haven't loved. Their taco salad is really great! The meat could use some seasoning, but that doesn't stop me. The inside of this establishment could use an upgrade, it's pretty outdated and misleading. Walking in the door, I probably wouldn't want to eat the food honestly. The only other downside is that the drive-thru takes a really long time. I would still highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place deserves your money. I go at least once a week and get the #22 burrito. I always see the same guy and admire how hard he works/how nice he is. Salazar Bros is a much better alternative to Filibertos I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Great place for fast Mexican food. The food is authentic and the proprietor is super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be close by  to my house but then they relocated and the food is worth the extra 10 minute commute. The super nachos are delicious."}
{"text":"omg best menudo ever!!! seriously i go here every sunday to get the menudo and its amazing i crave it every day... if your looking for the best menudo go here!  we also get the chorizo egg burrito and its amazing as well. friendly staff very attentive also super  clean . best menudo!!! keep up the good food!"}
{"text":"Thought it'd be like a typical hole in the wall mexican place (NY style), but it was actually like a fast food like set up. Huge portions, really friendly dudes at the counter, pretty great for mexican food i think. I didn't eat there, but it definitely seems like something you could do, but i think takeout is probably best."}
{"text":"We love the tacos and the green chili burros are outstanding . The service is great and fast.  The new location is much larger and even has a drive thru."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about the carne asada tacos.  Unfortunately was disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for 3 years and for a quick bite or late night snack Salazar Bros always delivers. Kind of hard to place orders in drive thru but that's not a deal killer when the food is this good. Amazing Hard shell beef tacos, carne asada fries, and an assortment of churros are all A+"}
{"text":"I have drove past this place many times and finally decided to stop in. At first glance I was impressed as it is clean, had no funny smells, and bathroom was clean (I always wash my hands before I order). Ordered basic Carne Asada Burrito and my girlfriend order a chimichanga of some sort with rice and beans. After I ordered my food I noticed there was no salsa bar, that sucksc something fierce. Got our food fairly quick and GF asked for salsa which they gave us green and red in ketchup style bottles. My burrito was quite a bit smaller than most Mexican food joints I go to, but I wanted to be positive and thought quality over quantity....well after my 3rd or 4th bite I realized there wasn't much of either, and the salsa was the worst I have ever had (Taco Bell has better salsa). My burrito had more pico in it than anything else. I am use to my carne asada burritos being meaty. My GF said she was not impressed with her food either, and the best thing she had on her plate was the refried beans. I don't think I will be frequenting this place any time soon, as there are a plethora of other options within the area that have quality and quantity. Two stars for cleanliness and food coming out quickly."}
{"text":"My go to spot. Authentic Mexican food for half the price of filibertos. Get a chicken taco and a shredded beef taco. Maybe add the bean and cheese burrito too. You won't be able to finish it!"}
{"text":"Salazar Bros food comes faster and fresher than the competition up the street. They are also more friendly. I have only had carne asada burritos,  quesadillas, and enchiladas so far and all were delicious. The meat was tender.. and the beans were magical ;) oh ya and the sauce is titties. Get drunk and try this shit out b"}
{"text":"Lightning fast service early in the morning. The place also looked clean and neat. Got the nachos and a bean 'n cheese burrito with rice. The burrito was definitely enough food for a filling breakfast. I swear it  was at least 12 inches long. The nachos I feel were overpriced, the guac. isn't fresh, but the cheese was decent so it made up for it. I'd love to see them throw the nachos under a broiler or something to help melt and cook the cheese. Overall a good place that will cure the late night Mexican food munches."}
{"text":"I feel like I must have gone to the wrong place.  First, the map and location here on Yelp is wrong, it's not on Southern/48th it's on Baseline/48th, they moved.  I had the carne adobada plate, after reading the rave adobada reviews here and frankly, I don't get it.  The meat was essentially flavorless and the rice/beans forgettable.  The only good part was the corn tortillas and they weren't even great.  I think this place's reviews are a direct result of Phonecians having very poor taste, in general, and for food.  Not to mention it was gross inside and the outside was ghetto as fuck.  I double-locked my ride and dropped the switches so fools couldn't run off with my 13\"."}
{"text":"DON'T get the chile rellenos from this place. Unless you enjoy disappoint in your life - skip it!  Taste like cheese, tomato and green chile that's blan.Rice is plain and refried beans are salty as hell.    Why can't I give 1/2 a star?"}
{"text":"Salazar Bros is a full step up from ubiquitous  \"__bertos\" option both in Tempe and throughout the valley. The only downside is that they are not open all night. Their carnitas and carne asada are both excellent, and the guac is not the green slime you commonly find at the aforementioned competition. Haven't yet gotten too creative, so I have no opinion on their mariscos or other more adventurous Mexican offerings.   Also, they are really nice there and always make you feel taken care of. 4 stars in the overall grand scheme of eateries, but for what it is I feel comfortable saying it's 5 star Mexican fast food. Please support these guys and keep them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I drove the extra 1.2 miles because of the reviews. I wouldn't do it again. Meat was so-so, cheese was extra and they forgot it and the salsa was Filiberto's grade, at best, which I would rate only two or less."}
{"text":"I am falling more in love with this place each and every day. Super clean eating area and the back area looks spanking clean too. Friendly service, great burritos, and the tamales are soo soo good. Smells like Mexican Food Heaven in here my friends - good for a quick breakfast/lunch bite or late night grub after a night on the town."}
{"text":"Great portions of incredibly flavorful food. The burritos are jam packed with meat. The tacos are flavored just right and topped with colorful pico.  The relatively new location in the shopping center on the northeast corner of 48th St and Baseline may look like just another fast food Mexican storefront, but the food is well worth checking out.  Edited to add 5/23/2011: Nearly 3 years later and they're still in business and still excellent. Quick service and very good food from a simple but varied menu. While there was no one else in the place tonight, I'm really hoping that's not the norm. Quite a few businesses in this shopping center have shut down. This doesn't deserve to be one of those."}
{"text":"I got the two carne asada taco combo. It was okay. The beans were not hot enough to melt the cheese, the rice was good, the tacos just okay. A dirty table and a fly didn't make it better."}
{"text":"First, the food is very good and I would give the place 4 stars simply based on the quality of the food.  The refried beans are very flavorful and the rice was light and tasty.  I subtracted a star because I am comparing this location to its fast food neighbor about a mile East on Guadalupe called Filiberto's.  Filiberto's food is good, but they have the chips, salsa and pickled veggies bar that I love.  That's all Salazar needs to do; just add a chips and salsa bar and I'll stop going to Fili's all together.  Not to mention that Salazar Bros. green salsa is hot and extremely tasty.  Very few restaurants make a hot and tasty green salsa and they do theirs better than any in the Valley.    I will certainly be back to try their carne asada and fries and to get more of that green salsa!  *Tip* So you need to go to urgent care and the location on Guadalupe and Rural is on your plan?  Give your spirits a little lift and walk around the corner to get a little Salazar Bros."}
