{"text":"Organic pumpkin spice shake!   Heaven. It's a meal.  Great service and shady location on a hot afternoon."}
{"text":"Visited Shakes and Cones for a yummy treat after lunch and loved it! The chocolate soft serve was creamy, smooth, and so delicious. It reminded me of the soft serve you can get back east, which I have missed. So needless to say, I am thrilled to have this wonderful soft server shop nearby. I will be visiting as often as I can."}
{"text":"Excellent soft serve ice cream, and it is organic!
Choice of cups or cones. Lots of other items on the menu as well"}
{"text":"There is finally a soft serve place in the phoenix metro worth mentioning! Ice cream is so simple and delectable on top of being organic. The place is owned by a very nice young couple. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and took the time to address all our questions regarding items on the menu."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for shakes and cones! If you are ever in the mood for ice cream in the Scottsdale area, you must try this place out! Don't be afraid of the word \"organic\" on the sign. After one lick you will wonder where this stuff has been your whole life. Great, staff, great owners and best of all great ice cream!"}
{"text":"My 8 year old son loves this family tradition in old town! We love the BCG, banana, caramel and graham crackers... amazing, never disappoints. He loves the chocolate m&m's with sprinkles. ( review by an 8 year old boy full of sprinkles!)"}
{"text":"What a cute little soft serve place right in old town Scottsdale.  I got the twist with sprinkles and it was delicious.  I like that they make their waffle cones in house.  You can really taste the difference!  It is a little pricey and there is only outdoor seating, but still a great stop for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Shakes & Cones is the only soft serve I will ever go to again!!! With not only the friendly and inviting staff, the business is LOCALLY OWENED & OPERATED.  Shakes & Cones is making a name for itself in Scottsdale and will be the place to go for all of us around the valley. If you want a product that is tasteful and still healthier than most, Shakes & Cones is the place to try. Once you have tried Shakes & Cones I know you will be addicted and you will make the effort to visit over and over again. Thank you Shakes & Cones for bring a healthy alternative into a family love. Please visit Shakes & Cones soon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"love that we can step out of house and buy organic sweets at an ice cream walk up in the summer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm so glad they extended their hours. The BCG is one of the best ice cream treats I've ever had; however, it should be known that their shakes are more like a Dairy Queen blizzard in texture. Even just a cup or cone of their soft serve is good but you can always add some additions."}
{"text":"Been here before and loved the place. Anytime I'm on this part of town I always make sure to stop in. I don't know if I love it more than my wife loves this place but it's definitely a go to. Wish they opened earlier so we can indulge in the goodness they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Old Town.  Seems to be family owned and operated which, if true, is fantastic.  The servers are always happy and helpful.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Located in a cute location off the street. You order from the window rather than going inside. I ordered a vanilla blend with snickers and Nutella after work and it was sooo good. Satisfied my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant and the coffee and ice cream was great. Didn't take too long either. All in all good choice of place!"}
{"text":"Yummy soft serve certified organic non GMO KOSHER and Gluten free.  I had the strawberry shake.    It was really good.  All seating is outdoors and shaded."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a million times and never noticed it until tonight. Awesome ice cream, awesome service, and an awesome ambiance make this shop 5-star worthy! The vanilla soft serve is to die for. The girl who rang us up (named Francesca, I think) was friendly and welcoming and gave us great recommendations and her coworker (redhead girl) was warm and bubbly! It's clear these people enjoy working here, so props to the owners. I will definitely come back here, especially when I have guests in town!"}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious soft serve and such a cute shop. I am really a sucker for a well-designed look, and Shakes and Cones has a great atmosphere, from the sign and wall colors to the menu and casual, fun vibe. And locally-owned too!

Plus I loved my shake and got to eat it sitting outside on a beautiful afternoon in Old Town. I appreciated the organic non-GMO ice cream and felt much better about giving my 1 year old bites. The shakes are thick and have your mix ins of choice mixed throughout, so every bite was yummy. Wish I was closer and could enjoy a shake more often!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for the weekend and found this awesome spot!!  All the way from SF and really like this ice cream.  From simple cone to chocolate peanut butter shake.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Sweet sweet soft serve. Family night out in old town ended with this amazing new shop. Tons of choices, really fun staff and locally owned by siblings and their significant others who grew up in Glendale! It's always fun supporting local business, but this really is all my pleasure... so GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious organic yogurt with a great selection of yummy toppings. I recommend the Zoe's Cake Dish -- a perfect treat! Check out Shakes and Cones. You will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This is a really cool new concept. Great family run business in downtown Scottsdale. You order either vanilla or chocolate (which is excellent) and then from there they can make a huge variety of different shakes and ice cream desserts. Check this out if you're in downtown Scottsdale. It's right across the street from Bandera and next to RA sushi. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I think I got diabetes from how rich the ice cream is... But seriously an amazing treat for special occasions."}
{"text":"We had a great Oreo and Peanut Butter shake. The owner - Max - was great also.  The ice cream was high quality and we will definitely stop again the next time we are in old town."}
{"text":"I've been excited to check out shakes & cones since I saw the sign go up in their little order window last fall. I love their concept of locally-owned and operated, non-GMO, organic ice cream, I love the location and the feel and we had a good experience when we visited. The thing is, it's pretty standard ice cream. 

I love a good twist ice cream, so I got a small twist in a bowl. I liked it, but for me it wasn't something so amazing that it would make me pick them over another dessert stop. My husband had a strawberry shake and it was delightful, but again, nothing that set it apart from the competition. 

If you're walking by and thinking ice cream, it will fit the bill."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is so good! It's hard to find gluten and malt free ice cream, but this place does it right!"}
{"text":"Went again. This time I ordered the nutty buddy.  Seriously delish.  The sweet salty combo is wonderful. Just the right amount of hot fudge and peanuts.  The whipped cream was the best ever...they make it onsite.  This really is the best ice cream."}
{"text":"Best Ice-Cream in town. HANDS DOWN! Just go and find out for yourself. It won't disappoint. Great, friendly ownership too :)."}
{"text":"Great ice cream and shakes. I love that they use organic products. Also, great location with good parking. Pretty crappy customer service though. Everyone who works there is young and just seems like they don't really want to help you."}
{"text":"This ice cream is so delicious and decedent. Creative menu and cute walk-up service. Perfect way to cool off on a summer day."}
{"text":"The best ice cream you can get in the area. I have no problem saying \"no\" to other ice cream establishments, but if anyone even mentions the name \"Shakes & Cones\" I find myself at the window within the hour."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in old town I make a point to get over to Shakes & Cones! Their Vanutzel is amazing & I have never had anything I didn't like there. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place for a while.  We headed over there to find a hip little ice cream shop.  When I say little, I mean little (like no seating inside (just the two employees and the ice cream / toppings, etc).  Wife ordered the organic chocolate base with chocolate cake mix in.  I tried a couple bites to find it creamy but couldn't really taste the cake bits as they were blended to small.  I went with a vanilla base and the organic mint mix in.  It was extremely creamy with a very fresh mint flavor.  I would definitely suggest it!  There is limited seating underneath misters; which helped a little but not sure that will do much come July or August.  I will definitely make it a frequent spot when fall bike season comes again :) I'm also hoping that the organic ice cream options expand but they definitely have a tasty thing going!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Organic soft-serve ice cream!! I had the vanilla shake and my husband added organic peanut butter to his. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Pricey but the ice cream good. The person there was nice and friendly. Not a sit down place. A good place to stop by and enjoy a cone."}
{"text":"Seems like a love or hate relationship for most people. After around the third time at S&C, we broke up. I'm a big ice cream/soft serve lover, and at first I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. But then I had the salted Carmel shake a couple times after the first and something changed. Mega salt overload. Then I went to a standard mix in blend and it just seemed so bland. Lastly, I began getting the cones dipped in chocolate or Oreos. Bland. It just lost my interest, and now I have no interest to go back.

I think everyone should try it out once and see if it's for you..."}
{"text":"Service was fine product not that great. Only options where chocolate and vanilla or swirl of the 2."}
{"text":"Great little take out spot. Fantastic customer service and a perfect product. We live in south Scottsdale and it's the only place we go for ice cream locally!"}
{"text":"Clearly, integrity and being ethical is NOT on the top of their list. My suggestion? Do the right thing: either remove organic from their name OR use ONLY 100% organic products (not to be confused with \"certified organic\") and get rid of the cones, butterfingers and everything else that is clearly not.

Since I wrote this review I was harassed and belittled by the owner on Facebook , twitter, and yelp in a pathetic attempt to mansplain and defend his dishonesty."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because ice cream + Texas Sheet Cake, are you kidding me?

   ---   ---   ---

Our visit here was brief, but my decision was very easy once I saw this little gem on the menu:

Joe's Cake Dish
Chocolate Texas Sheet Cake topped with your choice of vanilla, chocolate, twist soft serve, organic whipped cream and nuts.

My wife makes a Texas Sheet Cake once or twice a year and I'm convinced that it is literally the greatest tasting substance on the planet Earth. I don't ever recall seeing it on a menu anywhere before, so as soon as I read those magical words, I was in.

After practically inhaling it in a matter of a couple minutes, I ask this question: why does every dessert place in America have this on their menu? Especially when paired with ice cream, I don't think it gets better.

Salute to Shakes & Cones for being the trendsetter that we need! More Texas Sheet Cake on menus in 2018!"}
{"text":"Best soft serve I've ever had! Try the Nutty Buddy if you like hot fudge and peanuts. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We went here today to get an ice cream but they were closed :( as we walked away the owner came out and asked my kids if they wanted a sample. When she came back she gave them both a huge cone for free! It was amazing!!! It tasted amazing and she is so generous! I'm so excited to share this business and come back..when they are open!! Lol
I'm so excited to bring my family to a place that serves non GMO deserts. This is rare and amazing! We are very health conscious and will definitely be spreading the word! 

UPDATE: Went back today with my whole family. They claim to open at 5pm on weekdays so we got there at 5 and nobody was there. Waited until 5:18 left a note and continued waiting for a few more minutes and left. Probably won't come again..this is the second time they were not open when they said they would be. I LOVE the idea and the sample we were given...but come on. You can have a great product but if the company is unreliable...it's just not worth it :("}
{"text":"New favorite ice cream place for our family! We have been twice, and both times have been fantastic!! We've tried the shakes, dipped cones, blend-ins and the coffee drinks...yum, yum, yum!! My kids love it, and there are so many options to make everyone happy!! The employees are friendly and happy to help! We will def be recommending this place to friends!"}
{"text":"I came here right around it first opened with my mom  back in Sept 2014. I have loved it ever since. It tastes exactly how ice cream should taste... refreshingly sweet. The owners (what I assume are the owners) are the NICEST people. Everyone that's I've seen there is always super friendly. I've had the shakes but I prefer the classic cone with swirl ice cream."}
{"text":"We have been going to Shakes and Cones for over a year now and it is by far my favorite place for Ice cream. ( We drive 35 mins just to get to go there some days.) My daughter has a red dye allergy and it makes it hard on her not being able to have sprinkles at most places but she LOVES the sprinkles from Shakes and Cones. Over the past weekend, I contacted Shakes and Cones to see if I could order sprinkles and ice cream for my daughter 5th birthday party. They were amazing with responding and had everything we needed ready to go on Thursday. Everyone was raving about great the ice cream is. My mom has not stopped talking about how good the ice cream was!! This is a must stop if you are ever in Arizona."}
{"text":"Don't even consider walking past this organic ice cream emporium!

I tried the BCG - vanilla soft serve ice cream, caramel sauce, banana chunks and graham cracker crumbs topped with whipped cream- all organic. Truly superb. 

Get your ice cream in a cup though because in the 108 degree heat in Scottsdale- it will melt faster than you can eat it. And you won't want to miss a drop of this delicious treat."}
{"text":"I'm not interested in burying the hopes and dreams of a restaurateur, but this places SUCKS! I can't recall the last time I threw away an ice cream cone after 30 seconds. Small twist cone for $4 plus a $1 tip to the really excited staff (NOT). Bland, bitter, not enjoyable, abject flavors.....need I carry on. The fact I'm actually posting something regarding an ice cream cone should tell you all you need to know. It's organic alright......like dung!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun little ice-cream shop in the streets of Old Town! Shakes & Cones is a bit on the expensive side, however they have organic soft serve which I've never seen before. It's super creamy, soft, and delicious, everything I hope for when I get soft serve!

I got just plain vanilla the couple of times I went with my friends, however I know they have a bunch of mix-ins to choose from. I thought the vanilla alone had a lot of flavor so I'd be tempted to get just that over and over!

If you're going to stop by, plan on just getting something and heading out right away. There's not much seating around, but it's a good choice for a cold treat on a hot day (or really any day) while exploring the downtown Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Bland soft serve. I was really craving ice cream one day & they were super close, so I decided to give it a try. I never expected it to be anything but delicious. 

They have chocolate & vanilla soft serve. It's literally no different that a Dairy Queen or McDonald's soft serve, except they are both cheaper & taste better. I'm confused. How do you make something so simple bad? 

The service was lovely, but with so much better product elsewhere, I'll skip a return trip here."}
{"text":"I got the kids cone because...diets. Boo. But man, this place was delicious. Plain ol' swirl was anything but plain. Well worth the calorie investment. 

Pricey? I guess. But gluten free. Organic. GMO free. You pay for what you get. 
You want quality, delicious ice cream? This is your place. You want cheap? Go to McDs. 

And! For a place that \"may not be here in a year\", they just celebrated two years. I think they've got it figured out. 

Thanks for an awesome treat!"}
{"text":"Cute shop in and awesome location that serves delicious organic soft serve! I got a cup of vanilla topped with cookie dough, but my fiancé ordered the salted caramel blended and said it was just delightful!"}
{"text":"Have visited Shakes and Cones a few times now, and have found my particular favorite is the Affogato, a coffee float.  It is terrific and made particularly great because of the certified organic soft serve and organic espresso.  

Now, by no means am I a foodie, but I am kind of surprised at how harsh some of the reviewers are being.  Nowhere did I find anything in print or on their signage that said that EVERYTHING in their place is 100% organic, nor did I find the people working their to be rude or unethical. After reading one of those reviews, I looked and asked, just to be sure-

I have been served by different people at different times and have found their customer service outstanding.  

Thanks for adding a bit of sweetness to Old Town Scottsdale...am telling everyone I know about you - and that's A LOT of folks."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with this place. Much of what I didn't like has already been stated in other reviews. I really don't like the \"stand\" concept. This is AZ. We need our AC. I got a twist cone, but it was mostly chocolate. I should have stuck with just vanilla as it was the better of the two. I do wish there were more flavors. I know you can get mix ins and whatnot, but those don't work out well in a cone format. Prices are a little steep, but I do appreciate the quality and organic nature of the soft serve."}
{"text":"Such a cute and simple place! The ice cream is delicious and taste even better during the summer:) love the fact the the menus is simple and not cluttered with options it keeps the long lines moving fast. 
I would recommend grabbing any available chair you see if you want to sit and eat. Sitting is limited"}
{"text":"I love Shakes and Cones.  It is one of my favorite places in Old Town.  The owners are super friendly and take pride in their store. I love that the business is family owned by Phoenix Locals. The ice cream is so yummy and creamy and knowing that it is all organic makes for a great treat.  It doesn't matter if its hot or cold any time I am in Old Town I make it a point to stop at Shakes and Cones.   My favorite item off their menu is the cookies and cream Blend-In.  It is waaaaayy better than any other ice cream spot in town."}
{"text":"Shakes and Cones is a walk up window style store front.  They have killer organic soft serve  ice cream!  Unfortunately they only have 2 flavors (vanilla and chocolate) but with all of the delicious extras, you can get really creative."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! My better half and I were visiting Phoenix for the day and I got a craving for some soft serve (92 degrees in May will do that to you). I found this little gem on Yelp and we drove on over. My standard ice cream go-to is a twist with rainbow sprinkles (or \"jimmies\" if you're from New England), but the sprinkles shipment hadn't come in yet... Good thing there were so many other delicious options available! I ended up with vanilla in a waffle bowl with cookie dough, heath bar and Oreos mixed in (Blizzard-style). Girl's gotta splurge sometimes! They were extremely generous with the toppings and the combo was fabulous, especially in the fresh edible bowl. The BF got the banana/graham cracker item on the menu and it was incredible too. And the best part is, it's all organic! So as you drive off stuffed full of sugar and creamy goodness, you can give yourself props for making the \"healthy choice.\" ;)"}
{"text":"Affogato? YES PLEASE!! I have never tried anything so delicious in my life. I am for sure going to come here every time in town."}
{"text":"Awesomely natural and gluten free. Great toppings and smooth soft serve. Loved it.
Super nice owners, husband and wife team. Clean, nice outdoor seating right in front. Reminds me of Super Duper in Bay Area but ice cream is better!"}
{"text":"Shakes and cones is awesome! First their ice cream is organic! Second the vanilla has real vanilla bean flecks.Third the team is amazing Tianna and Jessica are so sweet! 
Don't go to old town with out stopping for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Twice I've gone and no chocolate! Machine broken. Disappointment . I can understand once maybe,but I'll have to think again about the choice for my dessert."}
{"text":"Delicious and the service was great! The owner was the one who helped us and he was very personable and passionate about his ice cream! He took the time to explain the product including where the coffee comes from. Loved his energy. I tried the strawberry and vanilla swirl and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow..it's been about three years, but finally returned. Owners were nowhere in sight on this visit, but the shake I tried was pretty good. Even though we are in Scottsdale, paying $7.50 for a small shake is a bit too much. That said, the shake I had was the Smores special which was vanilla soft serve, some graham cracker crumbs, fudge and marshmallow fluff. It had chips and whipped cream on top. It was refreshing and tasty and I guess if you only go once every three years, I can swallow the over charge."}
{"text":"The soft serve is sooo yummy I just wish the other ingredients/options were organic as well. I also don't like the fact that they serve their organic product in a styrofoam cup with a plastic spoon... Get some cute biodegradable packaging and more organic options. Over all the concept is great just needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"After our experience, I'm a bit befuddled by all of the positive reviews.  

The idea of a \"stand\" (it's just a window where you order and there's no indoor area at all) is cutesy but on a hot Arizona night when it was 110 degrees at 8 p.m., it was annoying.  This place has soft serve and while I like soft serve, I didn't care for mine. The texture was odd and almost mealy."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for delicious organic soft serve!! Get the vanutzel!!!!  Great customer service and product"}
{"text":"The best soft serve ice cream in Scottsdale hands down! Great menu options, very fast and friendly service. Always my first choice for dessert! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, healthier, and home-made ice cream.  This is located in old town Scottsdale. It looks like a kiosk in a building complex because you don't actually go into a store but order on the sidewalk. A worker there was helpful by explaining what they serve and recommendations. 

I shared an order of the large soft serve salted caramel ice cream. It was so cheap for such a large cup. My fiancé and I couldn't finish it off because we were already high on sugar. 

What makes this place amazing is that the price is cheap by serving in cheap styrofoam cups and plastic cheap spoons. It's what the content counts because that's where the money is well spent.  I'm definitely coming back here either on a very hot day or even a gloomy chill day."}
{"text":"Great concept, awesome shake/blizzard thing ever! I had a oreo vanilla mix. Very pleasant staff."}
{"text":"YES. The best ice cream cone I've ever had. Worth the price! I can never go back to Coldstone again"}
{"text":"Great ice cream. Had the nutty buddy which was  loaded with Spanish peanuts and organic hot fudge over a huge mound of organic vanilla ice cream. The walk up window is legit and kaytlyn and Ashley are very friendly. Def worth some visits."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Tasty treats, awesome coffee and a friendly staff! Perfect when you're walking around the Old Town area!"}
{"text":"I have now gone here twice due to the owner's respectful e-mail to retry this business because the first time there were some issues and I will say it was  better the second time. This time I just ordered a vanilla malt and it was decent. I will say that the owner truly cares about his business and makes an effort to keep customers happy and I respect that."}
{"text":"Pretty good soft serve. We shared the nutty buddy  we decided on soft serve twist of vanilla and chocolate. It was layered with fudge and Spanish peanuts. The fudge sauce was average. It was not a chocolate tasting as I like. There was an after taste with the fudge.   The soft serve was smooth"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Their organic soft serve ice cream is so creamy and perfect. You can choose from chocolate and vanilla and then they have a variety of mix-ins that you can choose! I chose vanilla with Nutella, organic bananas and graham crackers mixed in, served in a waffle bowl. Wow, holy sweet tooth heaven!! :) One thing to note, this isn't really a \"sit down\" place, you order at the window and there are a few chairs in front, but I wouldn't plan on dining there, it is the perfect spot to grab a tasty cold treat and then enjoy it during your walk around Old Town!"}
{"text":"I am a self-proclaimed soft serve connoisseur and I LOVED my cone and experience here. The price is very fair and the ice cream is made fresh in small batches. I love that you order at a window and eat outside. The seating area has mist fans surrounding the stand, so everyone is kept cool.

I decided to get a small vanilla cone dipped in crushed Oreos and my boyfriend got a vanilla and strawberry twist. I like to judge a soft serve place on their vanilla and strawberry, and let me say, their strawberry was delicious. I usually don't like strawberry, but the flavor was spot on with no hint of artificial flavor at all. The Oreos on my vanilla cone were crushed small enough that they stuck on perfectly onto my vanilla ice cream. So much to love about this little shop!"}
{"text":"Thanks so much for bringing amazing chocolate soft serve to Old Town...Dairy Queen will be missing me. 
Ben and I have been raving about your yummy treats and excellent service (Hi Max!) since we stopped in last Friday. 
We'll be seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"Best soft serve ice cream I have ever tasted! I'm obsessed... You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"What do you do after you've eaten a ridiculously huge dinner and couldn't possibly eat another bite? Well you go ahead and order up a dessert from Shakes & Cones! C'mon guys, everyone knows we've all got a separate compartment for dessert!

I decided to order a kid sized Nutty Buddy which is the Shakes & Cones version of a simple vanilla sundae with chocolate sauce and roasted peanuts. Very simple, but totally effective. I liken it to a fancier version of a McDonald's sundae, which just happens to be my fave go-to drive thru quickie snack. It was the perfect size as there's no way I'd ever be able to finish a regular size by my lonesome.

Even though it was only five minutes to closing, the girls at the counter were very thoughtful and happy to take my order. I hope to return again some day and next time I think I'll get a plain cone with soft serve so I can really enjoy the simplicity of their flavors which everyone raves about."}
{"text":"I've been going to Shakes & Cones since the day they opened. The soft ice cream is great!!! It's organic and does not have the hormones, antibiotics and other crud that is in most other ice cream. The owner is very friendly and the staff is as well. Unlike some other reviews, the wait time is never too long."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Arizona. And it's ORGANIC! My doctor said I needed to gain weight and actually told me to eat ice cream! I'm not a soft serve person but theirs is rich and creamy. 

I had the vanilla sundae with caramel. The caramel is incredibly rich. The vanilla was flavorful and has actual specs of vanilla in it. Not bland to me at all.

And the other time I've visited I had the Vanutzel. Simply WOW. 

Met the owner who said that the ice cream is their own recipe. So this is not some preordered junk that you can get anywhere. 

If I lived closer I'd be back all the time."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place as we were leaving the farmers market one Saturday, and what a treat it turned out to be. I used to think soft serve ice cream was all the same, but Shakes & Cones takes it to a whole new level. I ordered the BCG (bananas, caramel, and graham crackers) which was fantastic - fresh banana makes SUCH a difference in a dessert. It was just the right amount of sweet and incredibly refreshing. 

Definitely worth checking out if you're in Old Town, especially with the weather heating up."}
{"text":"I'm not normally an ice cream person, but this was so good that I'm still craving more!  Went with a classic vanilla fudge sundae.  Quite possibly the best ice cream I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to order ice cream from the window in Old Town Scottsdale.  We stopped by one night on the way back to our hotel from dinner and really enjoyed - simple, but tasty."}
{"text":"Originally, we had neither heard of this place nor were intending on coming here. However, due to a slight incident with a stranger; we wound up enjoying this delightful shop.

Let me explain.

After dinner, my wife and I often stroll through Main Street and various parts of Old Town. We were walking south on Scottsdale Road, and I heard the sounds of brisk walking coming upon us from behind. Off the corner of my eye, I saw this guy with his hands inside his jacket about to walk past us. However, as he passes us; he immediately stopped. Then he steps in front of us (mostly her), and turned to mutter some words. My wife gets startled, screams, then starts hyperventilating.

I had already grabbed her coat, moved her aside, and I stepped in between him and her. He screams, takes his hands out of his pocket, apologizes profusely and begins to quickly walk away. I was probably a second away from kicking his a$$. 

As I comforted her, I yelled at him and informed him that his movement was not appreciated. He apologized again as he walked away. Now, my wife and I have always endeavored to be kind to strangers; and once the adrenaline had resided; I yelled out to him asking what he wanted. 

He yelled back that he was a tourist, and he was looking for Rehab Burger. Since the situation was now calmer, I summarily informed him that his actions would have definitely gotten him some Rehab Burger Therapy of a different sort. He laughed, my wife laughed, and I guided him to where it was at on 2nd street, which was the next street over.

Now, the best way to calm my wife down after an unnecessary scare like this is to offer her sweets. We didn't really want to walk all the way north and fight the crowds at Sugar Bowl. At that time, we were already at 1st street. And as I looked east down that road, I spied Shakes & Cones. And so there we went!

A short walk across Scottsdale road, and we were there. I was still so concerned for her that I didn't notice the fact that you order and pick up through the giant windows. I tugged at the door, and went right in - DUH!

The two young ladies smiled and politely informed me / us that we can just order at the Window, and we don't need to come in. And they assuaged my embarrassment by informing me that many people make that same mistake. (Pro-Tip: Order at the Window!)

They are billed as Organic Soft Serve. Pay close attention. Let me inform you that you should dispel any reservations you may have about Soft Serve. McDonald's and Wendy's and other fast food restaurants may have given Soft Serve a negative connotation.

Not so, here at Shakes & Cones. Their Soft Serve is fantastic! Period!

My wife had the BCG, and if there is anything that could have put some calm back into her demeanor - this was definitely it. She absolutely thought that the BCG was both sweet and delectable.

I had the strawberry shake and the Affogato. Both of these items were equally as delightful.

The flavors and consistency are of high quality, and the fact that it is Organic gets this shop an A+ rating in our book. We have been back several times since this writing, and no lost tourist has been harmed in the process."}
{"text":"I actually discovered this place on accident! I had just finished dinner nearby, and happened to walk by this cute little walk-up ice cream place. It's right behind RA sushi. 

It's all organic, and absolutely delicious. I like to get a swirl cone (chocolate and vanilla) dipped in their \"magic chocolate shell\" with rainbow sprinkles. The chocolate shell CANNOT be missed. It is literally the best tasting part of the whole cone, and that's really saying something because the soft serve is amazing. 

They also have organic sodas, which you can turn into a float. The root beer they have with their vanilla soft serve is unreal - definitely try it sometime. You can also get ice cream mixed in with toppings, like a blizzard, or get a sundae. 

This is a GREAT place to grab dessert after dinner in Old Town!"}

Was in and out. Everything was okay, but the shake didn't stand out."}
{"text":"Really great ice cream, friendly staff, and large servings. They also have a cute sidewalk area to sit and eat. Really nice for a night time snack. We had the blend ins and thought they were great and creamy."}
{"text":"Love this little shop! The gentleman owner is delightful! He has a great staff but was still making the waffle cones! The soft serve vanilla and chocolate twist in a waffle cone is really good! Great location in Oldtown Scottsdale with outside tables and chairs. I wish this business loads of success!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that it's non-GMO and organic. Quality and flavor is excellent. Nice knowing the dessert is made with high-quality ingredients

Happy friendly service. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great ice cream spot with organic and natural ingredients! I would recommend the salted Carmel shake, it has spun Carmel and pieces of sea salt in it... amazing! Pro Tip- sign up for their rewards program with your phone number & receive free items! Only outdoor seating available!"}
{"text":"Came here 5-15 at 8:45 pm & the employees were non-enthusiastic & the medium cone I received was tiny.  I asked for a new cone & got another tiny one.  
We used to come here when they first opened & the owner was friendly & the cones the right size.  For $4.95 it was a total disappointment.  The owner needs to oversee his teenage employees.

UPDATE:  I have since had correspondence with Dave the owner and he has been really great listening to my criticism.  I have upped my review in return.   The soft serve is delicious (as I had not stated before) but I wasn't feeling it from the employees that night."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for at least a month...better late than never I suppose!

I traveled to Scottsdale over the holidays with my wife and 2 boys to get away for a few days.  After grabbing a bite to eat we decided to wander around Old Town Scottsdale just to check everything out.

Luckily we happened to park right behind this cute little soft serve shop.  As we walked by, we saw two people smiling at our kiddo's and having just finished lunch, the timing couldn't have been better.

Turns out it was the owners who helped us.  They couldn't have been nicer giving our boys a chance to sample a few things to make sure they got exactly what they wanted.  I had vanilla with brownie and carmel and it was absolutely delicious.  I can't remember what the others had but I do know that we walked away completely satisfied.

I've used Yelp for a long time and I am not much of a poster but knowing that this business just opened recently I wanted to make sure to give a nod to a place that does business the right way.

Will be back again when we travel to Scottsdale for Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Get the Vanutzel! It's amazingly delicious. 

Shakes & cones is in a great location in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for my after dinner treat! It's a walk up only place with soft serve and shakes.  I'm usually not wild about soft serve, but their specialty creations are tasty! $6+ for cones and shakes is a little pricy for me though."}
{"text":"Creamy and delicious soft serve ice cream! I've only tried the vanilla but I hope to make another visit and try one of the mix ins because they sound amazing! The staff was friendly and attentive. We sat right in front of the window and they checked in with us a few times to see how we were enjoying our ice cream and if we needed anything else. It's a great spot not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I am very turned off by places with iPad checkout machines which immediately ask you if you want to leave a tip. Then the employee looks at that and will probably make my food with the tip in mind. Especially for a place limke this that has portentously high prices due to the rent they pay and the organic mumbo jumbo they advertise their ingredients as

Does a Vanutzel taste good? Yes. But is it worth $7.50 PLUS a tip (of presumably at least a buck)? No. 

If the owners want employees to have tips, get it off the f'in iPad and put a normal tip jar like Starbucks. Why do you think sbux doesn't do the dumb iPad thing? Because they've probably focus-grouped the be-jeezus out of it, and learned the obvious: it TURNS CUSTOMERS OFF. Now I'm writing a review with a good tasting, over-priced product in hand, while pissed off

PS. I did notice there's already a tip bucket for cash and coins. So why have a tip option on the iPad as well? 

Funny thing. As I was eating my over priced vanutzel, a couple with a dog walked by and the man stopped to check this place out. After a minute, as they walked away, the man said, and I quote: \"I can deal with Some transgressions, but five dollars for a soft serve?\"

Lesson to be learned for this place. People don't tolerate insane prices for things on which they are used to a normal price range. If you want to stay in business, at least make your (probably) number one seller, your soft serve, more reasonably priced. People will come for the soft serve, not be turned off by the price, and then maybe get your more specialty items after that. It's worth the gamble if you price it right

Five stars for the ice cream taste and presentation. Two stars for the price, which is determined by their probably-insane cost of rent. One star for the ipad"}
{"text":"I am from New York, so of course I am extremely picky when it comes to food. Moving out here was somewhat of a culture shock, mainly because I couldn't find any soft serve ice cream! I've been on a search for months to find decent ice cream out here in the desert. 

On my way out to dinner in Scottsdale, my hubby (from Tennessee, didn't know what all the hype over soft serve was) saw the sign for shakes and cones soft serve. I already thought, it must be frozen yogurt but we gave it a try anyways. A man told us they weren't open yet but if we stop by later and they get a machine running, they'll let us sample it. 

I obviously returned, eager to taste this organic ice cream. I wasn't sure what to expect but WOW! It was delicious. Very close to a carvel taste. It is creamy and you can taste how fresh it really is! My man finally understands why I can't just settle with dairy queen!! 

Not only is their ice cream amazing.. But my hubby and I stuck around and conversed with the owners a little and they are awesome. :) I will definitely be taking the 30 min drive out to Scottsdale regularly to have my fix of soft serve ice cream as soon as they open! I'm super excited :D"}
{"text":"Organic ice cream yes please! I love their twisted cone! Located right in Old Town so is the perfect stop during a stroll through town."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop by and grab something cold to eat while you walk around! I had the chocolate shake with butterfingers and it was great. The flavors are pretty limited but the quality more than makes up for it. Also the amount of toppings you can choose from is a big plus as well. The seating outside is pretty limited but you should take it to go anyway and go explore while you eat!"}
{"text":"Oh mylanta that was some good ice cream!  I got the salted caramel shake and it did not disappoint! I will definitely be coming back to try some more items! Worth the drive from east Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We just finished up lunch and we were looking for some dessert.  Stumbled on this cute place that had soft serve! Score!

Ice Cream:  The soft serve was pretty good.  Very rich and creamy.  There were little chunks of white stuff in our vanilla cone.  We thought it might be chunks of vanilla? No idea.  It will remain a mystery. 

Soft serve (small run you 3.95) can be ordered in a regular cone (no sugar cones available) or cup.  You could order a waffle cone but for some extra mula. Oh, did I mention this place serves organic soft serve?

Service:  The lady who helped us was nice.  It was her first day working alone so she seemed very scattered.  

Ambience:  You order your ice cream from the window. You can't enter their shop.  Instead, you enjoy your cone on a few chairs and tables right in front."}
{"text":"Was majorly craving some ice cream last night, and wanted to try some place different, then I had remembered this place that I had bookmarked on Yelp! The words \"non-gmo\" and \"organic\" in combination with ice cream is always a good sign. Even though you know it is still not healthy, its not quite as bad, right?
Was surprised to see it was just like a little stop at the counter outside kind of place, but I liked that. I would have liked to see more seating though, there were only like six chairs and two or three tables when I went. Our cashier was nice, he was obviously being trained, but did a good job, he made sure to double check he had everything right which was nice. 
I ordered a small twist cone with sprinkles. Swirl ice cream is a childhood favorite of mine, and they didn't mess it up! Sometimes soft serve ends up too icy, like either the flavor or consistency is off, but this soft serve was smooth and tasted good. There were way too many sprinkles on my cone for my liking though. Not that it was awful, but I do not think I would get sprinkles next time. My friend got a vanilla ice cream blended with peanut butter. I did not like it much, the peanut butter was overpowering for my taste, but he loved it. Ate a large at warp speed haha. 
I would love to come back when it starts to heat up, try some other things on the menu!Like that one with Nutella and pretzels, I've got to try that!"}
{"text":"I think they are all in for the name. Their soft serve ice cream isn't to die for nor does it even taste \"organic\" as they claim. The price is kind of on the high side but then again they are in the heart of Scottsdale so I guess it evens out. I would rather go to McDonald's to get their soft serve ice cream cones. I have not tried other flavors so I'm only judging based on what I've ordered."}
{"text":"I like to grab a soft serve swirl cone at this place when I'm in the area.  You order at the counter that faces the sidewalk and then they get your order to you.  The cashier chick has always been very friendly.  Prices are a little higher than other places because they use organic non-gmo ingredients."}
{"text":"Solid little place to get some soft serve. My GF had a chocolate shake and I had the vanutzel. She thought heres was good, not great. I felt the same way about mine too. This is a walk up place, with some tables and chairs out for patrons. Not out of this world, but would have no problem returning to."}
{"text":"We shared a soft serve waffle strawberry cone and it was as delicious. I love how they hey outdoor heaters right outside their order and pick up area! Smart for this time of year."}
{"text":"A little pricey but delicious!! Yum! You can taste how natural and organic it is!! Great seating outside. Relaxing and there are misters. Great place to hang outside."}
{"text":"Soft serve dipped in a delicious \"magic\" candy shell? When it's 102 at night , not a bad idea.

Great ice cream, organic. 

The real standout here though is the service. Two nice looking and extremely nice college girls who were intelligent and can hold a conversation.

A rarity in 2015.

{"text":"Best soft serve I've ever had! Awesome location in downtown Scottsdale and great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love me some Shakes and Cones! Simple cone chocolate vanilla swirl with sprinkles is my to go order. Also, love the ice tea!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard as far as soft serve ice cream goes. I mean, who loves soft serve?  It's always pretty good, but not better than legit ice cream.  So your going to be satisfied if your in the mood for something cold and sweet. They are a little heavy handed on the salt in the Salted Caramel shake so ask for a little less salt than normal if not into it being really salty!"}
{"text":"Remember when you were a kid and Dairy Queen was delicious? Then when you got older, you and all your friends lamented how it's not the same as it was any more? Well, Shakes & Cones in Scottsdale felt your pain and they apparently set out to create a soft serve ice cream shop that brings back those memories of delicious, soft frozen memories. Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. I have been watching this space for a while now, waiting patiently for them to open. It was worth the wait!! No joke. The coffee shake I had was so so creamy & good. I can't get enough!! My son had the swirl cone & said it was his favorite ice cream ever!! 

Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but well worth it for the organic ice cream. The waffle cone was delicious. Everything tastes great and fresh. Overall 4 stars only because of it being slightly pricey."}
{"text":"I stopped by today for a treat, I got the twist cone. It was so good! It's the real deal too, you can see flecks of vanilla in the ice cream. Delicious!"}
{"text":"So good! The menu is really diverse and it's nice to have as many options as they do. We ended up with a strawberry waffle cone, which we split between 3 people. It's was delicious! I really appreciate that the ice cream is organic. The location is right next to Bootleggers and RA Sushi, east of 1st St and Scottsdale Rd. Cute outside setup and we loved the warmers by the register and pick up areas. 

Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Shakes and Cones is an organic soft serve ice cream shop over in Oldtown Scottsdale. When you walk up, there is a big window where you order your food. Then, you go to the other window to receive your soft serve. 

     The service is quick and friendly. The staff is energetic and eager to serve you. I especially loved how my server asked me if I wanted to eat my shake with a spoon, or a straw. 

    The chocolate and vanilla are smooth, tasty and creamy. Their strawberry flavor is my new craving! It is fresh, flavorful, and amazing. You can try any one of their specialty shakes, or make your own creation with the blend-ins. (different toppings that are blended in to your shake) Or, if you want to keep it simple, have a straight up shake. Along with shakes, you can have various sundaes, soda drinks, and homemade waffle cones. Their Batch Craft sodas are made with pure cane sugar. This soda is a nice healthy indulgence, and is a great alternative to traditional soda. We really love the root beer freeze, where ice cream and soda are blended together. Super yum!!

     Shakes and Cones is a must-do if you are visiting or just want something sweet. I will continue to eat here for years to come."}
{"text":"Had the CBG (caramel,banana,graham cracker) all organic. Some of the best ice cream I've ever had! Now I know why they have rewards system...you will be back!!"}
{"text":"So great! Love this new cute little walk up place. We had a swirl cone, dipped cone & a root beer float. All delicious! A fun new little treat in old town!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great place for some friendly staff and yummy treats.  Their counter is right  at the street and they have great places to sit outside to enjoy th AZ heat. We got their Smores shake and it was like camping!!"}
{"text":"The Oreo Shake is great. I've been thinking about it all week. I'll certainly be heading back for more!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the organic stuff, but the incredible, custard like soft serve ice cream is terrific.  Really, really nice folks too.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing snickerdoodle shake!! Friendly staff.  Asked for some broken waffle cone to sprinkle on top of my shake, no problem. And I highly recommend the addition!!"}
{"text":"Tiny hole-in-the-wall (literally) with the most delicious vanilla soft serve.  It's so awesome that  I'd eat it if it was laden with chemicals -- but it's organic, so I can enjoy it without guilt. Yum."}
{"text":"Just visited Shakes & Cones today for the first time and had one of their specialty shakes - AMAZINGLY GOOD!

I think these guys just opened up this weekend as their full menu wasn't quite available but now I have even more options to look forward to on my next visit. Do yourself a favor and check them out."}
{"text":"Best organic soft serve you'll ever have. Enough said.Tucked away in old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Super cute place. A couple of friendly girls were working the place on the Saturday night we came by. They were totally open to us making our own concoctions. Beware there is no indoor seating and limited (maybe 8?) chairs outside. 

We ordered the Nutella sundae thing which was tasty but not exceptional and also a hot cocoa that tasted very much like the cocoa my Swiss family makes for me (a bit malty?). Sweet surprise 

Overall I'm not a big soft serve fan but this place was fun and quick. I enjoyed walking around old town with our treats! I would return if looking for dessert in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Shakes and Cones in old town Scottsdale about a week ago and it was fantastic! I tried the Vanutzel with Nutella, soft serve, and chopped chocolate covered pretzels and it was extremely tasty. My family had tried a number of other items and they all were delicious, it is definitely a spot to stop for. With most everything being organic you can feel less guilty about getting a sweet concoction. Another factor that puts Shakes and Cones over the top is it is a local business with friendly staff and a happy atmosphere. If you are in Scottsdale or even the Phoenix area Shakes and Cones is a definite spot to visit!"}
{"text":"Had to introduce my friend to the affogato...she's hooked!  Always a treat to go to Shakes & Cones!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live down the street and have walked here several times.  We've tried a few different items; root beer float (they have a line of organic sodas), sundaes, shakes & cones.  The shakes are not your typical, suck through a straw, variety. They are thick and delicious.  The chocolate is great.  Think Wendy's Frosty, but way better.  My only complaint is that a cup & cone are the same price, but you don't get as much with the cone."}
{"text":"I've recently stopped back by shakes and cones and had a great experience. The two at the counter were so nice and pleasant, a far cry from the snobby teenagers they had previously employed. In addition to following up to see how the ice cream they also offered me water while I was sitting at their outside tables. The organic soft serve was quite a treat, and I will be back for another one. Thanks for getting rid of the bratty teenage counter people, their manor was truly a turnoff especially to my diabetic wife who could not eat the larger standard portions and simply asked for less and in turn was treated like she had asked them to turn summersaults. Nothing curdles ice cream like sour demeanors. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely simple walk up ice cream, shake, and coffee place.  Their ice cream is amazing and the service is great.  We had a vanilla blend in with brownie and it's better than 90 percent of the ice cream places I've tried.  Price is very reasonable for scottsdale. ."}
{"text":"Super light soft-serve! I typically don't like soft-serve ice cream but the texture of the ice-cream here is like a light custard. Lots of options to chose from (shakes, sundaes, and cones). I like the seating area so I don't have to eat in my car. Cute shop and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! the best soft serve ice cream I've had since Disneyland. 

This place is a cute little ice cream shop with outside tables and seating. My friends and i were debating if we should have ice cream here... the friendly customers outside said \"you won't regret it\" lol... 

We looked at the menu and BAM! found an ice cream named after my alter ego -- ZOE CAKE DISH!!!  

soft chocolate cake with your choice of soft serve ice cream (i chose chocolate) with whip cream, chocolate syrup and shredded nuts.

mmmm mmm mmmm good! the best. #notsharing jk i shared. Definitely worth the calories.

Friendly service from the young ladies working the shop.

thank you."}
{"text":"Top notch ice cream delivered the real way. A must for our family when looking for a sweet treat. So much so we drive from Tempe to get our fix!"}
{"text":"We wandered over here after dinner next door at Bootleggers and it was the perfect sweet treat! I live in this area so I was surprised I had never heard of it.. So here I am writing this review, in the hopes that other people will discover and try it!

Shakes & Cones is a super-cute, window-style stand with many different types of ice cream desserts! It was creamy, smooth, and delicious. I got chocolate/vanilla swirl with Nutella and cookie dough added (..sweet tooth is an understatement), and my sister got the Vanutzel - a vanilla/Nutella shake with chocolate covered pretzels mixed in. My brother loved his order too, keeping it simple with a cone of vanilla!

Definitely check this place out! Oh and they have a free loyalty program so don't forget to join before you leave.. We are definitely rackin' up dollars towards free treats! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried it liked it...won't necessarily be back...
Nothing wrong with with the place or service just wasn't spectacular....
The window service was good...very attentive and friendly. 
Ice cream was good...I think the biggest draw is it's organic and all natural which is super cool but from a taste perspective it didn't seem to standout...
I won't do go back but I would make another out of my way trip...if I happened to be close and in the mood for ice cream then I'm there!"}
{"text":"OMG - delicious!! Cute place, super nice people and AWESOME soft serve ice cream! DO NOT MISS SHAKES & CONES when you are in old town Scottsdale ... this is NOT your typical soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"Totally Totally hits the spot on a hot Arizona day.  nice to know that its made with organic ingredients and the price isn't outrageous. Some places will take advantage of calling themselves organic and up the price , but not the case here. The cone was very plentiful, at least for my consumption. I really wanted to try the affogato but didn't want to be glutinous since I wanted a full size cone as well so I opted for a cone and an iced coffee. Coffee was good, which only made me want an affogato even more...oh well.
Minimal choices on flavors, they really only have chocolate and vanilla. So if you are wanting variety this is not your place. But if you want a good simple cone made with organic ingredients, totally worth the stop. Next time I'm in town, i'll try the affogato."}
{"text":"Tasty menu options of shakes, cones, waffles bowls, sundaes and coffee! They have GMO free, organic, Kosher and Gluten free options. Inexpensive prices considering the awesome ingredients. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream ever! There should be a Shakes and Cones in every state. Not only does the ice cream taste amazing but the mission of this place to serve organic products makes it even more amazing!"}
{"text":"The tastiest soft serve in town!

Enjoyed a strawberry & vanilla swirl cone and can't wait to return to try one of their \"DQ inspired\" shakes or ice cream mixers.

Cute walk up store front with heat lamps overhead and friendly employees."}
{"text":"The menu at Cones and Shakes is pretty basic. They have soft serve with various varieties of dessert using it such as affogato, sundaes and shakes. They also have coffee, both hot and iced.

I went for the most basic item, a small size cup of soft serve vanilla. The ice cream itself is organic and non-GMO. Although we had what seemed to be the easiest order to make on their menu, for some reason it took quite some time for them to make it for us. 

The shop itself has no indoor seating but they do have a few tables with misters outside. Since it was pretty warm outside even with the misters we decided to eat our soft serve while walking back to the car. 

The soft serve was very decadent, and probably some of the best I've had. It was very rich with a smooth creaminess similar to really good frozen custard. They use real vanilla bean in their ingredients and it was a perfect amount of sweetness. 

The price for the small was a little over $4.

Although there's no indoor seating it's a great way to cool down if you're around Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"While walking around downtown Scottsdale, my wife and I spotted Shakes & Cones and decided to stop for ice cream. 

My wife ordered a cone of chocolate soft-serve ice cream, and I ordered a \"Straight Up\" chocolate shake. The guy running the store was all by himself, but he did a good job of getting our ice cream relatively quickly. 

The reason I ordered the \"Straight Up\" chocolate shake and not ice cream was that the menu described the shake as being \"thin\" and specified that you could drink it with a straw. However, my shake was basically as viscous and thick as ice cream. Only at the very end could I actually drink it with a straw. I know that the employee didn't just give me an ice cream accidentally because I saw him mixing the shake at the machine. However, he may have hurried to get the shake to us seeing as a line was building at the register. 

Taste-wise, we both enjoyed the dark, richness of the chocolate ice cream. I just wish that I could have had the shake."}
{"text":"Love this place, chocolate shake and chocolate affogato my fav, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The young girls at the counter are bitchy but really good ice cream so I keep going back."}
{"text":"It was HOT when we visited Arizona for Spring Training. I mean over 95 degrees HOT. No amount of water was keeping us cool and we were wandering around Old Town just killing some time before dinner when we spotted Shakes & Cones from across the street! I feel like soft serve gets a bad rep because of the stuff we get from typical fast food joints but Shakes & Cones serves up some high quality stuff! Everything is organic, gluten free and made with non-gmo ingredients and I really felt like it showed in their soft serve! My chocolate and vanilla soft serve was so rich and creamy that I couldn't believe that it was soft serve! It carried the same decadence as ice cream and it was absolutely satisfying. 

While Shakes & Cones may have perfected their soft serve, they could use some help in their drinks department. Their Chai Latte was very average and didn't carry the same richness in flavor that I associate with chai lattes. It was the same with their Americano. It wasn't anything special. Now, usually I don't have an issue with drinks being extraordinary or what not but Shakes & Cones charges a steep price for these drinks because they're all organic and such. For the prices, I expected a little more. Anyways, if you're in the area it's worth a visit. I would just stick to their soft serve because that was amazing! 3/5"}
{"text":"So, okay. I had soft serve frozen yogurt. Just a swirl, small size, nothing fancy. I can't imagine why this place gets 5 stars. I was unable to locate anything special about it. We came after eating dinner down the street after finding it on Yelp, and after seeing the reviews, expected to be blown away. My husband got the blended froyo with m&ms. Again, the froyo base is the same so nothing special. Yes it was creamy, but an average soft serve to me. Seating sucks, and I don't like to walk while I eat my dessert since I can't concentrate on it. But it's just an ice cream, not too expensive (relatively), so not much harm if you do decide to try it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Always hits the spot, whether I'm ordering a swirl or dipped cone."}
{"text":"Good points:
1) Non GMO
2) Organic
3) Friendly staff
4) Great location

Not so good points:
1) Not many flavor choices
2) Kids size in cups but not shakes/malts
3) Vanilla male with chocolate was fudge. (Doesn't blend well.)"}
{"text":"I'm editing my original review. The owner reached out to me and was so apologetic and tried to make things right and I really appreciate that! He invited us back on his dime but our trip was short so I couldn't take him up on that offer. Any owner that cares that much and tries to make it right is 5 star in my eyes! 
Originally our worker was very unfriendly and cold which led me to not feel comfortable returning my order that I didn't care for. Had I originally dealt with the owner I would have returned what I disliked and gotten something else and would have loved it and given it 5 stars. He obviously cares about his business and shouldn't be punished because I was unfortunate to deal with the wrong staff member. Good job sir!"}

{"text":"Love this place. Total find... And where I take everyone visiting. Best ice cream in Phoenix. :)"}
{"text":"Great place! The ice cream and shakes were tasty and they had a lot of different flavors. the mist fans and outdoor seating made it a nice environment. Our orders were made very quickly. Only possible negative is that the serving sizes for the shakes are pretty large, keep in mind when ordering. Overall, a great place for ice cream on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Ashley and Sara were awesome! The sundaes were amazing! Great service as they were closing on a Sunday night. Before they closed the windows made sure we had what we needed."}
{"text":"When I dropped my wife off to get her hair done, I had a few hours to burn in old town Scottsdale and I stumbled upon this place. Pretty unique to have a walk-up window, so I liked that about it right off the bat. The guy who was running the register was super nice and friendly, so we talked for a quite while about life. The soft serve was very good and really smooth, so I was surprised to see that it was organic as well. I got a coffee/Heath bar shake, which was probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. I'll definitely be going here more often; I might even take my wife with me next time :)"}
{"text":"You know. . . vanilla is sometimes just plain. Boring. Unoriginal. Blah.

But not here.

Shakes and Cones Vanilla is like seeing your high school crush again ... and man . .. are they sexy! They're sweet...giving...velvety ... creamy...sexy....delicious... Yes I'm still talking about the ice cream.

The Salted Caramel Pretzel shake is the naughty boy you were told not to date. .. but you do so anyways because what does your mother know? The saltiness doesn't overshadow the creamy, delicate caramel..but increases the flavor profile 10x... Like the naughty boy getting a brand new motorcycle--- swoooonnn!!!!!!

Give it a try! It's a quaint little stop in Oldtown and bring your high school crush or bad boy ex with you!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. 

$3.75 for a small soft serve vanilla cone?

The taste was extremely average. Certainly this is not big league ice cream in terms of soft serve. Dairy Queen is far superior. My wife was also completely unimpressed. 

Yes it's organic. Yes that makes me feel warm and tickley inside. Yes I don't mind spending $3.75 for a knock out totally superior ice cream. 

This ain't it. 

The reality is that unless you drown the mediocre vanilla in some kind of toppings - on its own, this is a very so so vanilla that is no tastier than McDonald's. 

Some of best vanilla soft serve ice ever tasted can be found in Norway - not at shakes and cones. 

This place IMO is unlikely to make it - I will be surprised if it is here next year. 

Sweet republic is so much better (not soft serve but true quality ice cream).

If the owner now leaves a goofy comment after my review - please - no need thanks!"}
{"text":"I decided to go with the salted caramel soft serve which was actually delicious. It was not as salty as your usual salted caramel products. I will come back her again to try the bcg which my friend had that was actually really good. It convenient and pretty reasonable prices!"}

We came out from gilbert to try it and will continue to get our soft serve from here! We will just avoid going between 12-5pm as the summer is way too hot to stand outside (I devoured my ice cream because it was good but also because it was melting fast). They don't have indoor seating but they do have water misters if the heat doesn't bother you."}
{"text":"Nice little stop... bcg shake was really good! Although it's a bit pricey. The large size is really not that large. And for $8? It's the cost of a meal! The soft serve is much more affordable, but nothing spectacular. The s'mores shake was really rich and not one you can drink through a straw. Cute spot, nice concept, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best ice cream places I have been too! I was really craving a soft serve one night, and my sister and I were really close by this place! Super super cute, and AMAZING ICE CREAM. I just got the vanilla kids cone with sprinkles. The soft serve is really homemade, you can see the vanilla bean in it! Sprinkles are dye and high fructose corn syrup free, which always makes me feel better. Everyone there was super friendly and nice, and we will definitely be returning to try some of their awesome sundaes! :)"}
{"text":"Came here today and got a blend in sooooo good!!!The two working the counter were so awesome!!!! They were so helpful and nice!!! Great time at shakes and cones!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been a fan of shakes & cones since day one! Their products are high quality. The owners are seeking to run the place right. We've been the recipient of their rewards program several times. But the the night they showed why they are the best around. I ordered a shake and asked for peanut butter in it and it came just as I ordered it. But for some reason, I just couldn't handle how rich the peanut butter flavor was. I took my drink back up the counter and explained that I actually wanted to order another drink and they insisted that I not pay for it. This my folks is customer service. It's rare today, but places that have it are worthy of repeats - often. If you haven't tried shakes and cones - go today!"}
{"text":"Great new little Ice Cream shop in the Scottsdale Old Town area!  We were walking around on vacation and Ashley had the hankering for a cone!  We decided to check this place out!  Glad we did!  The owners greeted us with a smile and told us they had been open about a month now!  

I asked if they had Vegan Ice cream, and No dice on that so I got a 32 ounce ROOT BEER, It ruled!  They offered to top it off before I left as well! Very Nice of them!  

Ashley enjoyed a organic vanilla ice cream cone, and she thought it was fantastic!  A perfect lazy Sunday afternoon treat while on Vacation!  

Glad we stopped by Shakes and Cones! Should be renamed Shakes, Cones, and SMILES!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for ice cream in old town!!! The staff is always friendly and the ice cream is outstanding. The late night hours are also very convenient!"}
{"text":"Remember Nutty Buddies/Drumsticks/those things? Imagine a made-to-order rendition, mostly organic, not irreparably freezer burned in a 94-pack from Costco (ah, the summers of my youth...) You can totally get that at Shakes & Cones, but I have no idea what it tastes like. 

That was the plan, but then we sat down with a \"Vanutzel - Nutella, chocolate pretzels, vanilla soft serve - 12 oz.\" (watching the figure, obviously.) And \"Also, the Texas chocolate sheet cake with swirl soft serve ice cream and peanuts and whipped cream, add chocolate pretzels.\" 

Highlights: happy family-run (mom's due in two weeks!), fragrant vanilla soft serve, salty chocolate pretzels, peanuts, organic whipped cream, rewards card to fuel the addiction. I could've done without the super sugary sheet cake and the chocolate soft serve, but didn't do without, and ate all of it.

So yeah.  I'll get to the Nutty Buddy Renaissance eventually... until then, I may have lost my Cakes & Shame privileges."}
{"text":"Organic soft serve ice cream in cups, cones, and shakes! It really is a basic soft serve ice cream place, but lots of organic toppings (organic fudge!) and natural sprinkles (no food coloring or artificial ingredients at this place). I would definitely come back if I revisit the area!"}
{"text":"Be patient, it's worth the wait!!! There is normally one person taking orders and making everything. 

The Salted Caramell is the must here. It's a Carmel, creamy shake with flakes of sea salt, very rich. My boyfriend and I shared and couldn't finish it. Never happened with dessert before."}
{"text":"This is the perfect little ice cream stand to hit up after a nice dinner on a summer evening. They offer up all organic soft serve ice cream with all the delectable mix ins you could want. They are price compatible with cold stone but you get much better quality ingredients. The gluten free waffle cones are fresh & smell divine. The ice cream itself is nothing short of perfect. It doesn't take some time to get your order bec there are usually only two people working but IT IS worth the wait! They have a little patio area and cooling misters to help beat the heat while you wait! Last night I got the small BCG shake with Nutella mixed in, and it was absolute heavenly! The organic ingredients truly make all the difference in the world! This place is literally walking distance from my home so I have a feeling I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for best ice cream in Scottsdale and was excited to stumble upon Shakes & Cones. The girls behind the counter were super friendly and willing to accommodate my order of hot fudge sauce on the side (I was bringing it back to eat at our hotel). I ordered a chocolate in a cup and my husband ordered a twist blend-in with peanut butter and brownie bites. Not a drop left in either of our containers by the time we finished! And I loved knowing that it was organic and made without any fillers or artificial ingredients!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is definitely organic, creamy and delicious. I had the chocolate fudge sundae and it does provide the good quality of ice cream. Just a stand in Scottsdale and is nice because it is in a good area near the art district."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for crepes, and we happened to park right in front of this place. The sign ORGANIC soft serve (also, gluten-free and non-GMO) caught my eye right away because McDonald's soft serve is secretly one of my most favorite ice creams. On our way back from brunch, I caved and ordered a cup. You walk up to a window where they take your order and a second window to pick up your order.

Soft serve Flavors: vanilla, chocolate, swirl (combo of the two). I ordered the vanilla because I wanted to compare it with McDonalds. But really.. you shouldn't compare this ice cream with regular soft serve. For me, the only part that makes this 'soft serve' is that it comes out of the machine things. The ice cream was creamy and smooth. It had that homemade-feel. I got the kids cup size which -thank goodness- was the perfect amount for dessert. It was a lot more than what I thought I would get too.

Eat quickly because there's no indoor seating. You get your ice cream outside in the Arizona heat, and it melts FAST."}
{"text":"Almost did't go here since it is all soft serve, but our server at lunch said it was good so we gave it a try. Great tip the ice cream was awesome. I had a twist in a cup. The flavor was awesome. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Cute little walk up window that serves non-gmo, gluten free ice cream.

There are SO many options for sundaes, but they have 3 regular flavors and a seasonal flavor of soft serve ice cream. All the additional flavors come from their extensive list of add-ins and toppings. 

Portion sizes are really generous (judging from the \"small\" sundaes coming out of the pick up window) and the price is fair. I had the affogato, which is 12oz of vanilla soft serve with a pour of hot coffee for $6.95. I'd recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and service in person. Don't ever use a delivery service as the staff will invariably cause an issue that will result in multiple charges and no delivery."}
{"text":"I got the blended vanilla soft serve with coffee! It's honestly the best thing I have tried. If you are a coffee lover you will absolutely love the blended vanilla with coffee! It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"First off I'm a sucker for a business owned by locals, I love that they are using organic and non-GMO ingredients.  That being said the shakes are awesome.  Personally I like mixing peanut butter cup and Oreos but I can't wait to try a few of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Simply delicious and the staff was fantastic. We tried the vanilla and chocolate soft serve.  The strawberry sundae was perfect and the whipped cream home mad. Make sure you try it."}
{"text":"As much as I would love to avoid hyperbolic syntax, this is THE best soft serve I've EVER had. I'm bummed we didn't join the loyalty program about 30 visits ago. We used to hit up a certain gelato...spot...(who shall remain nameless), but after hitting up some classic sweet, sweet soft serve, the cravings for this ice cream just don't stop when my sweet tooth strikes. 

I love the adorable setup with the sidewalk window smooshed between 2 restaurants. My hubby and I love to take a stroll after dinner in Old Town and \"end up\" at Shakes n Cones (as if it just happened by chance) and then continue our stroll through the hood with ice cream in hand. Walking and consuming ice cream basically offset each other, right? That's what I'm telling my hips. The selections are quite simple - cone, cup or shake. Chocolate, vanilla or twist. Classic toppings/mix-ins, nothing complicated like you find in overstimulating fro-yo joints these days. Ready in a jiffy (or a little longer if there's a line). Sweet-as-can-be staff at a family-owned establishment. The fact that the ice cream is organic is a major plus. All the goodness lives here, all of it!

There is always room for ice cream. Wait, there is always room for THIS ice cream."}
{"text":"Seriously,  this is the worst ice cream Ive ever tasted. Or not tasted, I should say. My friend got a coffee shake with brownie bites. Coffee was bitter and brownies were non-existent. I got a dipped cone that tasted like waxed chocolate. Vanilla ice cream was bland as well. The best part was it was $20 for 3 cones and a small shake. Do yourself a favor and skip this place....ugh...I can still taste the waxy coating on my shitty dipped cone."}
{"text":"Delicious soft serve ice cream that organic! I had a small caramel sundae which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The whip cream seemed like it was out of a can, I expected better, homemade, for the price. Not much of a place for sitting. Its a store front only with just a about 6 chairs and 3 tables outside. I think this place could be much busier if there was indoor seating. Good for take-out."}
{"text":"I love that it's organic and non-GMO and am willing to pay the slightly higher prices for it but why on earth would a place that serves organic only ice cream use STYROFOAM containers??? That's like smoking at the gym. Styrene=cancer and is not biodegradable. If you skip the container and go straight for the cone, It's really really delicious soft serve. The chocolate is very rich almost like a pudding."}
{"text":"Such good cream. I fux w/ dis place heavy duty. Bomb ass cream. The kinda cream you drive miles out the way from your Airbnb your crashinin, while your out visiting your relatives in hot ass Fuk Arizona. But that cream tho... I still think about it"}
{"text":"I've never liked soft serve before Shakes & Cones, but wow, this stuff is delicious! I love to get the sundae with chocolate sheet cake, chocolate soft serve, and homemade whipped cream topped with chocolate syrup. (Can you tell I love chocolate?) Service is always fast and friendly, and it's the perfect little spot to get a treat after shopping in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"How difficult is it to order a small chocolate cone?

Apparently very difficult. ...it took 15 minutes and there was no line or no one else except my daughter and I.

A small place where you order from a window off of 1st Street and Scottsdale Road. 

So I order a small chocolate cone, did I say cone and a small chocolate shake. After waiting for 10 minutes my daughter and I sit down to wait and then after another 5 more minutes the girl brings out a chocolate ice cream in a CUP!!! Granted it was more in ice cream quantity than a cone but I ordered a cone and just mainly wanted to taste. I asked her is this the cone and she said she would give me a cone with the cup. I just said no.

And by the way 5 minutes later the shake was done. 

The soft serve ice cream was nothing special. 

I definitely hit the wrong time to try out this place and for the price would definitely not come here again.

Do yourself a favor and get into your car and go to Sugar Bowl down the street or go to Churn or Cold Stone and don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Tiana is the sweetest girl and she is there every time I go. Not only does she serve amazing ice cream you also get the best customer service experience. She's so enthusiastic about this amazing ice cream that it makes you want to come back to eat more. Good thing I have some discipline. Her and the other nice gal that work Sunday nights always take care of me, Tianna is my favorite. Amazing soft serve with and angelic smile!"}
{"text":"Saw this place walking to dinner and knew we had to stop back after dinner. We are so happy we did. This place an out doors and so cute, the staff is friendly, and best of all the ice cream is amazing! Every time I'm in old town I'll have to stop by!"}
