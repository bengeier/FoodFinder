{"text":"People...get real, this place is just as good,  if not better than your local hole in the wall. It's clean and well staffed with an excellent menu selection! They have great bands and can get a little loud but, if you're not into that, stay home.  Ask to be seated in Jake's section...if you're lucky, he'll be there to take care of you better than you deserve."}
{"text":"I ordered some boneless wings and it took over a half hour to get them on Sunday afternoon with no more than 20 patrons in the whole bar. People came in, ordered, and got their food while I waited for my simple order. Not impressed one bit."}
{"text":"The food was decent, the service was horrible.  The server greeted us as we walked in, we sat down and waited about 15 minutes for her to visit the table.  After receiving our food, she didn't come to the table to ask about our food.  We waited a very long time for our check.  The bar/restaurant was pretty much empty with several servers hanging around rolling silverware.  Life is too short to spend WAITING at Ace's in Middleburg Heights.  The prices seem a little pricy, as well."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the variety of homemade selections.  Same great food as their other locations.  Wings are outstanding along with the stuffed hot peppers!  My two favorites.  Very good beer selection too.  Highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars..would rate food but we waited 20 minutes o order and 30 minutes to get food still haven't got..this place blows"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs... nothing but rude bartenders and overpriced food.  I will never ever go back there again!  And I urge other people to do the same."}
{"text":"Barmaid very inattentive.  Ordered food to go.  The burger was good, not great not bad just good.  The fries were home made fresh cut but really needed to be cooked more.  But I must say the barmaids attitude was poor!  Service was poor!  I left a tip but felt like I should not!  For the price of a burger & fries and the average to poor quality and crappy service I would not go back.  Nor do I recommend."}
{"text":"Has great potential, but can you say \"A swing and a miss!\"  Came in on a Tuesday night. Special was 25 cent menu with bone b and boneless wings, fried pickles, shrimp and buffalo pierogies. We asked for one of each, but found out the shrimp was sold out, so we settled for 4 of the 5.   Our server was outstanding. Very friendly and attentive, but the kitchen took a bit longer than expected. Food came out in shifts- 15 minutes from first plate to last. Turns out they were almost out of pickles, so we got a half order with a half order of mini corn dogs. Unfortunately, the pickles described on the menu were planko breaded spears. We got cornmeal chips.   The sauce for the pierogies was excellent, but the deep fried nuggets of love were too tough to bit through. More like a fried ravioli.   The boneless wings were good, but the candies Cajun was just so so. The bone in wings, the last to come out of the kitchen, were in a great sauce, but we're not cooked nearly enough. Was like chewing through a rubber hose trying to get thru a drum stick.  So much wanted to like this place, with the outdoor patio and food specials. But then again, the overwhelming smell of diesel fumes while sitting inside the restaurant doesn't help either."}
{"text":"Nothing major to complain about, just an average place. We've been here about five times. The food is decent yet a bit pricey for the quality, the staff is friendly, and there's never a wait. They have live bands sometimes, but when they do its so loud you can't hear anyone talk at all. Everything is 'okay' all together."}
{"text":"Went to see a band here this past Saturday. Not crazy about the food, and for the quality I felt it was too expensive. Got personal pizza with four tiny squares for 7 bucks boyfriend got a spud meal for ? Don't remember price. (Picture attached)  Service started out great, then promptly got shitty after we finished our meals. We even made an effort to learn our servers name and we were very polite and patient, but then we barely saw her after our food was finished. We had to wait until she popped out of the back to flag her down to collect our plates and asked if she would clean off our table so we can enjoy the band. (We even asked to make sure she was staying while the band played so that we wouldn't hold her up from closing out). Again disappeared and my boyfriend had been finished with his beer for a good ten minutes. No biggie, I got up and grabbed him one with a bartender at the bar, paid w my cash, and brought it back to the table. Still no sign of our server until one moment I saw her come out from the back with rolled silverware (possibly doing her sidework) but we had to wait for her to come out and then ask her to bring us the check. It wasn't a gigantic deal, but the service was not as I'd expect it to be.   The beer I was given had ice formed around the bottom and the ice looked like it had an orange rust color to it that left a bit on my hands. Possibly not a clean cooler or ice bin.   Hearsay, but the other couple who had dinner with us told us the bartender charged them different prices for the same two beers the second time they went up to buy more.   And as a side note, and at no expense to the yelp stars for this review, the drunks here were extremely loud and annoying."}
{"text":"My review last June stated they would be out of business and now they are! Wish I was a betting woman! Good riddance!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came in for lunch this afternoon. He went to Pennsylvania Culinary and I cooked in various restaurants for 10 years. We both had a soup and sandwich combo. The soup of the day was chicken noodle. There was a lot of something in that soup. It was so overpowering we couldnt figure out what it was. In fact he just sent me a text in all caps saying it was killing him not knowing. I have a feeling this soup will be a topic of conversation for a long time."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give one star. Service was awful and bartenders were unfriendly and ignored you at the bar! Took 15-20 minutes to get a drink and forget tabbing out !!"}
{"text":"not worth it, even with a groupon, the onion rings were soggy, and getting 5 onion rings for 9.00 is pricey, the strip steak was terrible, like they pulled it out of freezer, lacked taste, baked potato was hard and cold, when I asked to have microwaved, the server stated there was no microwave, with so much competition out there, , I definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Tried my best to like this place, the food was decent, even though they messed up my order. Asked for shredded cheese on fries. Got nacho cheese. Asked for my burger to be cooked medium. Extremely well done.   Onto the service.... absolutely horrid. Sat ourselves on a dead Sunday. Waited over 15 minutes for someone to wait on us. Didn't tell us the specials of the day. Found out about them after we ordered. I would not recommend this place if you expect even decent service. And I work in the food service industry. This was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I went during the day for a quick lunch.  The service was very fast and friendly and the food was excellent!   I got a buffalo chicken salad, it was so filling and fresh.  I had to take half of it home because the portion was so big.  For $8 you really couldn't beat it."}
