{"text":"Great restaurant, very clean, food is awesome and very affordable.  This restaurant is run by a family, nice people, could be more friendly with customers perhaps their culture, i dont know.  We go there often and highly recommend."}
{"text":"L'endroit ne semble pas très achalandé, possiblement parce que le plupart des personnes que j'ai croisé sur place, venait simplement chercher des commandes à emporter. L'ambiance est décontracte. Service rapide. La nourriture est bonne, mais fait plus traiteur de plats asiatique à emporter qu'une bonne bouffe de restaurant asiatique à déguster sur place."}
{"text":"Nice hot fresh meals served quickly and tasty. This family run Chinese Restaurant has a trendy interior design and in a great location (being next to so many other restaurants).  We had gone with friends just after the holidays to try out the restaurant. Ordered the General Tao dinner for two, with an extra order of peanut butter dumplings (5). Everything was great. The General Tao had decent sizes of chicken - large amounts of it being white meat, and not having too much batter. The Singapore noodles surprised us as there was shrimp in it. Not something that we were expecting - but it was good.  Their egg rolls are all homemade and very tasty - however they are filled with only cabbage (no pork meat) Peanut Butter dumplings were a hit. Not watery at all, the peanut sauce stuck to them very nicely.  Certainly be back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant have a great and fast service. The foods are amazing. You don't have the after taste like most of the Asian restaurants. The price is affordable for the portion you eat. Always take the Chef suggestion in the menu during lunch hour. Tried other dish and I must say I will come back everyday. Good Job guys!"}
