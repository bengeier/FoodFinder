{"text":"Your typical hotel restaurant. The service was slow, way overpriced, mediocre side items. For the price of the food and the reputation of the hotel, I would expect there to be freshly prepared foods, nothing previously frozen and more creativity from those running the kitchen. 
Not worth trying when there are so many other great options within a short walk."}
{"text":"We only went there for Happy Hour on Monday, 6/5. During 4-5:30 on Mondays the cost for certain drinks are 1/2 off the Happy Hour prices, which made them really well-priced. The cabernet I had was excellent. My husband liked his beer too! The great thing about this place though was Lindy, our server. She asked where we were from and what brought us to Cleveland. When I told her we were in town to go to the Cleveland Clinic we talked for a bit. She was very knowledgeable about things to do in the city, which was helpful! When we went to leave she asked if she could give me a hug! She was genuinely such a wonderful person that we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the \"late night diner\" version of this restaurant, open from 11-4 am Thursday through Sunday. It seems like a good idea, as the hotel must house plenty of drunk people who crave breakfast and milkshakes at 3 in the morning.

However, it'd be worth your while to find a restaurant outside of the arcade. Try the street that connects it to the House of Blues district. 

The service here was beyond bad. They were just plain mean. We sat and waited at least 40 minutes for our food, all while we could see half of it aging under the heat lamps. When we were able to finally question the waitress, she yelled at us and said she'd assumed we wanted all our food together. Well, OK, we agreed, but could we just have the drinks we ordered? She yelled back that she thought we wanted our drinks with our food. Um, yeah. Everybody wants their Pepsi alongside their bacon, because it's as good as the finest of wines and clearly worth waiting for.

The food was simply average. Not even worth describing. Imagine your average diner in any town in America and that's what you'd get. Now add a snarling server and you've pictured the Late Night Diner.

I felt like the waitress was literally going to slap me around. I know that my friends and I were wildly intoxicated, and this must get extremely annoying as a customer base. But if you can't serve drunkards with a sense of humor, try being a waiter during the day. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"BLTA!!!!  The only green thing my 5 year old will consume is avocado.  And bacon is a favorite.  So, I got her the BLTA minus the LT.  OMG!  I dream about the quarter of that sandwich that she was not able to cram into her little tummy.  The bacon was so different and good!  I asked for crispy.  I can only imagine how good it would be +LT..  And the French fries were by far the best I ever had.  Crisp out, soft in, not too thick or thin.  And a unique flavor in itself.  I am NOT a French fry fan."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for happy hour and left less than impressed. Our server was a sweetheart and that was the saving grace.

The food was terrible. Our favorite part was the dessert. The ambiance was just ok too. I don't recommend it unless you're freezing, not hungry and need to stop in somewhere to warm up. Sorry."}
{"text":"I was officiating a wedding at the Hyatt so I grabbed a glass of wine to kill time.  While sipping away a couple of people came to the bar and the bartender was gone for well over 5 minutes, probably closer to 10.  She was friendly and timely with me, but seeing these people wait definitely dropped their stars."}
{"text":"We received a free breakfast with our hotel pkg. Upon going to the restaurant I was a bit nervous there wouldn't be much my husband and I would like. We like your basic breakfast classics. He wound up getting the frittata and I had the dark rum Carmel french toast. Wow! Both items were very yummy! The restaurant was pretty dead for a Saturday morning..and I had to keep asking for refills for my coffee which is why they lost a star. Always keep the coffee cups filled!"}
{"text":"Ok food but unbelievably slow service. Waited over 20 minutes for a breakfast burrito, server was nice food just takes too long to come out"}
{"text":"Two waitresses were here this morning. One that was sort of doing her job and the other one who was walking around but not helping at all. I literally saw my food sitting on the counter for five minutes until the one waitress served it to us. The second waitress walked by it twice, saw it, and walked on by but not because she was helping anyone. 

Food = Okay, I guess.
Service = Hello? Anyone work here?"}
{"text":"My work team held a Christmas lunch at 1890.  It's been years since I had been to 1890.  Things have changed.  We arrived at approx 11:30 and were seated right away.  The wait staff was super attentive.  The group of 8, proceeded to order.  I personally ordered an entree, Salmon, quinoa and brussel sprouts, 3 of my favorite dishes $22.  Everyone else at the table mostly ordered sandwiches and fries.  The food took a little bit of time to arrive, and there was no bread service while we waited.  My salmon was overcooked and the quinoa and brussel sprouts were mushy and tasted as if they had been left-over from the day before, broth added and re-heated. The meal was dull, unappetizing and a bit pricey for lunch. I don't think that anyone was really \"wowed\" by their meal.  I probably would not re-visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt and our room included breakfast at 1890.  What a nice assortment of breakfast dishes!  We were only expecting bland buffet style breakfast.  I had eggs Benedict with their homemade breakfast potatoes, a mix of white and sweet potatoes cooked with lots of onion and peppers and served with Siracha Ketchup.  

My wife had a spinach and chicken sausage egg white omelette.

Both dishes were good and they give you a large portion.  

The service was great too.  The decor is a bit odd, I think they need to redecorate to make the restaurant fit in better wth its historic surroundings. With some remodeling, this place would get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks were decent. We decided to hit their happy hour before heading to the game. The atmosphere is plain with no music or no excitement. Happy hour without being happy?? Not good. Other than that was good."}
{"text":"Had a quick workday lunch at 1890.  The restaurant wasn't at all crowded and, likely as a result, service was relatively quick.  The lunch menu featured a very hotel-like (which is appropriate, of course) selection of salads, sandwiches, burgers, and some dinner entree-like fish and steak items.  I ended up having the English Style Club Sandwich, which is turkey, smoked bacon, a fried egg, and Dijon mustard.  The smoked bacon didn't particularly stand out, but I think the fried egg and Dijon mustard tied the sandwich together well enough.  The dish comes with a choice of a cucumber salad (I think) or fries.  The fries were pretty decent--not as oily as one might expect.

The service was friendly and efficient.  Prices seemed a little bit high for what we got--lunch for 2 (sandwiches and iced teas only) with a generous tip totaled $40.  I wouldn't say this is a big \"power lunch\" place but you'll definitely see a number of tables full of suits.  Because it's tucked away in the Hyatt Hotel, which itself is a little camouflaged in the Arcade, I like 1890 as a low key place to get away for a little bit and enjoy a decent meal."}
{"text":"With my Starbucks...checking email at the Arcade....it's fun to be a tourist in your own city!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty standard hotel breakfast.

My family and I came in because it was the closest breakfast place near where we were staying. It's actually located in one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen, so the view is quite nice.

I ordered an omelet for breakfast and some bacon. The omelet was decent. It wasn't something I'd write home about.

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. I was mostly intrigued by the imported jams they had at the restaurant which were from Austria. The jam was very good.

Service was decent, kind of awkward at points.

Overall, not a bad place to eat breakfast, but not a place that will blow you away, either."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and I just got a salad that was pretty pathetic. Salad was $13 for a handful of mixed lettuce, not even a half of an avocado and red onions sliced so thinly that they didn't really have any flavor. The waitress was friendly, but not very knowledgeable about the food being served. At the end, instead of separating the check by item, she just divided the total by three, which made the total uneven for two of the couples with us. 

Not a horrible place to go, but there's definitely a lot better in the area, especially since you could spend the same amount on E. 4th street for a much higher quality product."}
{"text":"They are open late on a Sunday - so, that's +1 star from me, since they actually fed me after my delayed flight. If it wasn't for the welcoming and helpful service, the place would be a 2-star with a stretch.  The food is average, if not below... and the wine list is overprices and very limited.  
Since when the salad is a pile of oldish greens on a plate with some sprinkled cheese and dry flavorless croutons? Oh, it's a Cesare? OK... how does that explain old greens? and shouldn't the parmesan cheese and the croutons be the highlight? 

Anyz... thank you for feeding me late on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here only because the hotel gave us a $40 credit.  Who eats $40 worth of breakfast for 2 people you ask? The BF and I at this overpriced place.

A cup of coffee was $3.50, albeit with refills but it wasn't Dunkin Donuts that's for sure.

I ordered an egg white omelet with tomato, peppers and mushrooms. It came with toast and a side of home fries.  It also had this delicious roasted tomato thing with bread crumbs on top, no idea what it was but it was great. 

The BF had some sort of panini that he loved and home fries.  The food was really good, but it was priced the same as the food on the room service menu and I think the menu was even the same. 

The total came to $50 something with the tip. 

It was good for free, but I would have been annoyed paying $3.5 for a cup of coffee if it was out of my pocket.  Waitress was super nice and quick, also the guy who came around refilling drinks was mildly amusing."}
{"text":"We went for Easter Sunday Brunch. You come here for the ambiance not the food.   It was okay but not great, the views off the balcony is beautiful.  A few items on the buffet were very good: Omelet,  Roasted Potatoes and carrot pancakes.  Other food items looked very good but tasted straight out of the freezer box.  The roasted chicken was over cooked and very dry.  The chicken sausage was kind of bland.  Bacon seemed overly greasy, it's really hard to mess up BACON but somehow they managed to mess it up.   The dessert table was very pretty, however there was only 5 or so options, most of which seemed stale or overly rich (the chocolate moose was gross it tasted just like cocoa powder), however the lemon cake was excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a very nice brunch at the 1890 at my hotel, the Hyatt Regency Arcade this morning. The food was delicious and the service outstanding.  Ashley was super fast and friendly. She made great menu suggestions and checked back on me frequently.  I do a lot of business travel and when I am away from home, cheerful service makes all the difference in the quality of my stay. Ashely certainly earned an A+!  Overall, the brunch is a great value. There is a wide variety of items and there is something for everyone. Later in the evening I stopped back at the 1890's bar for a beer and a snack. Lynnd was the bartender tonight and was outstanding! She made a great beer recommendation and was super fast and friendly.  Overall, the staff at the 1890 are superb.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quiet place great for a little conversation. Reasonable beer prices and can take your drinks out of bar to wonder around or bring to your room."}
{"text":"Good food! Great service and I tried the Turkey and Bacon club sandwich with a house salad with my choice of dressing. I also tried the Tito Mango Tea which was delicious. I definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch for anyone. I just wish the hours were longer for lunch."}
{"text":"Service is not good. The waitress will take your order, never check on you while eating, and then you have to leave. Luckily I had $25 in free breakfast credit thanks to being a Hyatt diamond member and left my room number on a post-it note, but if you have to pay a bill, be sure to ask for it right away when you know you're done ordering. The last morning during my week-long stay was the only time I received an actual bill thanks to a better waitress (prices noted at the end). Your breakfast will typically take about 15 minutes to make.

Overall, the breakfast is not very appetizing. I ordered the corned beef hash with Hollandaise sauce, and it was okay. The skillet was filled more with potatoes than the corned beef hash. The \"hash\" was more like shredded, small pieces of of corned beef, like pulled pork. I really wish there had been more of the corned beef. This would've also added more salt and flavor to the dish. Without a lot of meat, the skillet was bland.

I also tried the lox bagel, which also was tasteless. I think I am too used to an everything or poppy seed bagel, which help add flavor. This does come with onions and capers, not listed in the description on the menu. I do realize that onions and capers are standards for a lox bagel, but the menu stated it was only served with tomatoes. I would've asked for no onions and capers if I'd known. This was okay, but just be aware there's no other side served with this lox bagel.

In constrast, the chorizo burrito is served with a side of fruit (not listed on the menu). This was actually very good, but of course, how can you not have a flavorful dish containing chorizo? Containing potatoes (same cut as the corned beef hash skillet), mushrooms, bell peppers, and eggs, I would definitely order this again. I should also note each morning I also added a side of bacon.

The fact is, is that I'll be eating breakfast here again because I will be staying at the Hyatt when I return during the summer. So, there's really no choice, and I am unsure if there are any other faster breakfast options within walking distance (especially when you factor in walking time). At least I'll have my own review to reference for next time. A word of advice - if the restaurant is out of newspapers, just go across the arcade to the hotel's concierge and pick them up there!

Burrito $13
Side of bacon $4
Orange juice $4
Tax $1.68
Total $22.68"}
{"text":"I found this in-house restaurant/bar just delightful.  Barb our waitress both mornings, could not have been nicer, cheerier, or more of a delight early in the morning.  She was attentive, did not rush us, and explained the lay of the land.  They open for breakfast at 6:30 which gave us time before our flight to fill out tummies.  The items available at the buffet were plentiful, hot, tasty, and they would even make an omelet if you wanted one.  The fresh fruit was in season and sweet, not in need of ripening as is often the case.

When you enter, the restaurant is to the left and the bar is to the right.  You can also enter the bar from the arcade after the restaurant closes.  Enjoyment at the start and end of your day."}
{"text":"Poor beer choices,  a local beer only available bottled! Coors on draft, only half of our Order delivered. There probably are many better happy hour places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I was not happy with our experience here.

Stayed at the Hyatt ARcade while in town and stopped in here one night after dinner for a drink. There were only two other parties here, one, a football fan from the wedding downstairs (obviously more interested in the game then the wedding) who was yelling f bombs the entire time he was here, and a father and his 9 year old son sitting  at the bar, yes at the bar, not in the bar area. 

The staff saw our annoyed looks at the continues antics of the pig in sheep clothing (AKA The wedding guest) but did nothing to calm his words or his tone. They also did nothing about the 9 year old bellying up to the bar with dad.

We opted for room service after this fiasco."}
{"text":"It's just another overpriced hotel restaurant; they are all terrible, except for the amazing AMP 150 in the Marriott. There are sooooo many awesome choices within walking distance that are better and less expensive than this place, even if you are staying at the Hyatt. 

I have been here twice, both times on someone else's tab. Both times, the service was great and the food was okay or even good...it's just not good enough to justify the expense. A bowl of soup is $9, for crying out loud!

The fried fish, fries abd cole slaw I had last Friday was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"I went there a few months ago and the restaurant was virtually empty. The service was lacking - we had to stand in the lobby for quite some time before anyone came to greet us, despite there being nobody else there (so it wasn't as if they were busy or short staffed), and we had a reservation.

The portions were good, but the food lacked seasoning. I went for restaurant week and I'd hope that isn't what affected the dining experience (in fact you'd think more people would be there...) - but others in my party got regular menu items and their food wasn't very good either. Everything was either over seasoned, or seriously lacked seasoning.

I made a huge mistake with my dessert - they had dessert pierogi because that was the restaurant \"signature item\" - and I was totally misled. They were truly foul. It  was a regular pierogi, with cinnamon and sugar on the outside (but not enough - just so you could see it, and when you tasted it made everything odd - in a \"food should not be like this\" way.) It came with honey, and whipped cream, but neither could mask the taste - or even attempt to make it a dessert. It was truly foul.

The drinks were ok, but nothing special. Actually, a place like red lobster and maybe even applebees has better ones."}
{"text":"This was my first item here. I can say I really enjoyed the place. Our server was Barbara; she was very pleasant, helpful and did everything perfectly. The atmosphere was really cool being in the Arcade and having a view of the Euclid Ave level of the interior. Inside the restaurant itself takes on the look of an American diner, but thankfully not in an overdone cheesy way. The food I ordered lived up to the healthy eating goals of Hyatt. I had salmon, cooked perfectly, over a bed of orzo with the most amazing combination of dates and pineapple chutney. And the sweet potato fries that came with my friend's turkey burger were so good, yes I stole a few. And just a note for those of you wondering where this place is - if you enter off of Euclid Ave (you can also enter off of Superior Ave.) you simply walk straight in and keep going and you will run into it. The lounge is literally straight back, the restaurant is on the left side across from the hotel lobby area. Also for you Platinum Hyatt Gold Passport Members looking to redeem your Platinum Extras certificate for 1,000 bonus points - doing so at this place for lunch or dinner is an option."}
{"text":"Sort of vacant hotel, but surprisingly a really great spot for a meal. It's not fancy, but the service was good and the food was tasty. Both times I've been it was consistantly good food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for drinks, but this was my first time for food.  We just ordered the pierogies before and evening out while were guests at the hotel and they were REALLY good!  I would get them again FOR SURE!   Very full of flavor, topped with cheese, scallions and bacon. I would ask for more sour cream, but I don't know how to control myself.... The drinks were also good and nice and strong.

On one of my other visits, however, I stopped in during happy hour.  To note, glasses of wine are NOT discounted, but bottles are.  However, each of the bottles I was looking for (it was cheaper to order a half off bottle than a glass) they were either out of or had already been opened.  When I finally selected a bottle, it was turned.  Overall, that experience was very disappointing and I ended up paying almost the same for a glass of wine that was only available in an opened bottle (that WAS on the happy hour menu) than for the bottle itself.  :("}
{"text":"Hotel bar and restaurant.  I ate (as per usual) at the bar.  Though I usually stay away from deep-fried food, I had the fish & chips.  Nothing special but not bad either.  

Behind the bar a young man was on his first day on the job and was being trained.  He has a lot of potential and I hope he is successful there.  I'm sure he will be."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I went here for breakfast.  First, it is in an absolutely beautiful building.  If you like architecture, check the arcade out.

The place was virtually, if not completely empty.  However, the food was solid.  I had an omelette with feta cheese and spinach, potatoes, wheat toast, and fresh-squeezed OJ.  The service was quick and everything was solidly good.  Nearly all options were healthy.  I would definitely return."}
