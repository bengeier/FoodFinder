{"text":"Breakfast finishes at 2 p.m. we arrived a minute and a half afterwards when our waitress came to us and said sorry breakfast is finished for 1 minute and a half!? What a ridiculous place don't bother eating here everything's gotta catch including how they treat you even if they do smile."}
{"text":"Nourriture bonne. Service souriant et efficace. Mais la chanson d'anniversaire, vraiment désagréable quand ça pars 4 fois dans le temps de ton repas."}
{"text":"La bouffe est bonne, mais je trouve que 20$ pour des pâtes c'est trop cher.  Le bar à pain était original!"}
{"text":"Pacini's was a nice surprise, I think the best part was just how unassuming it was in the mall here in St. Hyacinthe. You walk in from the mall side where it feels like it is pretending to be a nice restaurant and it actually is. I enjoyed a couple of dishes which I shared with my wife: the Cesar salad (average), the pizza (it was old-school thin crust and delicious), and some pasta (arrabiata I believe). However, the star of the show was the bread bar which obviously takes some thunder from the meal but when you can grill your bread with the following spreads: butter, garlic butter, tomato-basil, and another one I just can't remember, well you are in carb heaven. Check out the pictures."}
{"text":"Superbe décor et ambiance,  service impeccable,  plats délicieux que demander de plus?  Bravo Pacini St Jean sur richelieu!"}
{"text":"Agréable surprise pour le déjeuner, différent des autres, bon prix, bon service, j'apprécie la tranquilité. Nous allons revenir"}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant inside great service and good food Pizza look great Ambience was great"}
{"text":"Came on new years day... These guys have a bread bar...... With different varieties of butter (pesto,  sun-dried tomato)... U can also toast ur bread to ur liking... Nice ambiance"}
{"text":"Great service. Good driving distance fron hotels and Longueuil Metro Station. Excellent Italian food and ok wine list. Good portions for kids. And the \"make your own bred grill\" is always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, the service took the longest time ever (more than 1 hour to get the soup.)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Whenever I'm in town I'm always excited to go eat here. The menu selection is great, the staff are very fast and friendly, and the bread bar is a great addition and really sets them apart from others. The menu offers a great selection. One of my favourite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Pacini est un restaurant déjà connu mais j'ai adoré l'ambiance, j'y suis allé plus d'une fois et je n'ai jamais eu de mauvaise expérience. Le service est rapide, le personel est souriant, j'y suis déjà allé avec un enfant de bas age et le personnel nous avait amené des crayons et des petits jeux. La qualité de la nouriture est excellente."}
{"text":"Unique looking great design place with superior background music in a cross between modern Danish and garage but with acoustic padding and great really great look to the place. The seats are wonderful the layout is attractive the menus beautiful to look at and the food is quite decent. The staff is actually charming helpful and lovely and quick to please. we're at the one at the edge of the West Island of Montreal Quebec and it definitely needs more people on a Sunday to be here to stay in business but it is clearly fairly new and quite overlooked. It deserves many more people here but we're glad to get the fantastic service so we give it a 4 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"Pour un restaurant Italien qui pense que Sauce Alfredo c'est seulement une sauce blanc sans aucun parmesan, c'est dommage,  et ça a passé 2 fois, non seulement une. C'est un restaurant trop chère parce que ça inclut le bar a pain(bon) et la soupe minestrone(très bon) ou salade césar(bon). Je ne retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant! Nice ambiance, good service and good food, music was a little loud"}
{"text":"This location is nicely decorated, the service is courteous and the food is ok but hum why so expensive? I don't mind paying but the snails I ordered were tasteless because they were covered with oil, the duck salad had nothing extraordinary and the mojito tasted like lemonade. They have a bread bar with one choice of bread, I was expecting variety. I was curious about this chain but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Honnêtement,  au début j'étais un peu douteux sur la qualité de la bouffe au Pacini, car c'est une grande chaine. Finalement, je fus très surpris de la diversité de leur menu. J'ai choisi la salade de canard au chèvre et elle était excellente.   De plus, je ne sais pas pour vous, mais le bar a pain fait vraiment sortir l'enfant en moi haha. Le simple fait de choisir mon beurre et mon pain pour les faire griller moi même me rende très heureux. En plus, c'est un beau complément pour votre plat.  Finalement, le service était impeccable et la dame qui travaillait lors de mon souper était très gentille et très souriante.   bref, je vais y retourner et je recommande cet endroit :)"}
{"text":"It was passable that s it! But i did appreciate the fact they had in house bottled water in glass containers!"}
{"text":"Mon avis portera uniquement sur leur service de pizzas à emporter!  En passant, c'est très pratique après une soirée au cinéma Cineplex Odeon....lorsque tout/ ou quasiment tout est prêt à fermer sur St Denis! Le service est rapide et la serveuse a même proposé de nous téléphoner afin de nous avertir que notre commande était prête et n'attendait plus que nous!  Les pizzas sont rectangulaires et présentées sur du papier journal...c'est original!  La pâte est fine et la garniture aussi....mais ça  demeurent de bons produits; parfaits pour combler une petite faim!  Les pâtes peuvent être un peu brûlées aux extrémités! Je recommande la quatre fromages!"}
{"text":"This place has a fairly large seating area covering a couple dining rooms which makes it big enough for groups.    As a restaurant, it has pretty mediocre quality food, high prices and slow service. My sister and I tried out both a 4 cheese pizza and a pizza with arugula and prosciutto and a couple of salads.    The meals come with access to their \"bread bar\" which is a sad excuse for bread.  It looks (and tastes) like loaves of wonder bread from the supermarket.  There are some herb butters for it that help, but it is embarrassing to have such bad bread in any restaurant and especially in a city with so many good bakeries and restaurants."}
{"text":"Dimanche passé, pour la fête des mères, nous sommes aller brunché au Pacini de st-eustache. Sérieusement surpris par le beau menu déjeuner, autant pour les plats que pour les prix. En plus c'est le moment parfait de profiter du bar à pain pour vos toast! Si vous n'aviez pas penser aller déjeuner dans un Pacini, ça vaut le détour. Un très bon service de la part de Julianne, notre serveuse. J'ai pris le cassoulet (patates, bacon, jambon, asperges et le tout gratiné au four). Très bon. Surtout accompagné d'un bon mimosa pour bien commencer la journée! Tous les déjeuners viennent avec du bon pain au canneberges et un mini yogourt aux fruits qui rajoutent une bonne valeur ajoutée gratuitement au repas. Un menu pour enfant est aussi disponible. Content de voir que Pacini ont été capable d'adapter leur menu pour des bons déjeuners! Ils pourraient rajouter un oeuf à côté de l'olive géante sur la pancarte."}
{"text":"Excellent decor, service varies but sometimes its quite good. Enjoy toasting bread with the kids, glad that they kept this tradition.   The food has improved but still tastes somewhat industrial.  The prices have increased, the quality needs to increase along with it. A decent place for families."}
{"text":"Dernière visite ici catastrophique au niveau du service le serveur était arrogant et impolies un service de 35 personnes extrêmement décevant.  Aujourd'hui super service par contre le saumon goûte l'eau et le \"topping\" de légume goute beaucoup trop le vinaigre.  Une partie brune sur le saumon me laisse une amer expérience de la nouriture...."}
{"text":"Alright, so my friend lives in Longueuil so we went there for her birthday supper; she liked the bread bar so why not. The decor is very nice, modern and sleek. The four of us (all in our twenties) sit at a table and the waitress, a middle-aged woman greets us. She immediately takes away the wine glasses, saying with a condescending tone: \"I imagine you won't be taking any wine!\"  Woooow.   Okay, well I'm hungry and we're already seated so let's look through the menu and order something.  We ask 3 times for some water before she finally brings a small bottle, just enough to fill our four glasses.  For such subpar food, it sure took a long time to arrive. The salads tasted like one of those premixed bags you buy at the grocery store. No originality. Canned beets. Nice. The bruschetta was good. Pizza was okay. The only thing I really liked are their fries with julienne zucchini and caramelized onions. Bread bar was okay; just some good old sliced bread with flavoured butter.   I ended up eating many slices of bread and finished maybe 1/4 of my salad. I asked for it to-go, and the waitress paused. Looked at my plate with condescension. Finally agreed to wrap my plate up.   The expression \"péter plus haut que son cul\" comes to mind. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Very nice location of this chain.  The interior is modern and clean, and there's a ton of seating. The food is tasty (the prosciutto/arugula pizza and the penne arrabiata are my favourite), and the service is great.  Other pluses: Awesome Caesar, VERY affordable (2 alchy drinks, two starters that came with the two mains ended up around 60 bucks, tip excluded), and an open kitchen.  And of course there's the bread-bar, I mix butters for extra tastiness.  No 5 stars because it is still a chain and thus it doesn't \"wow\" you with its unique food, but worth visiting if you don't mind chains.  We will come back often."}
{"text":"Ah le Pacini et son bar à pain. On va là comme on va au St-Hubert, bref on sait à quoi s'attendre et qu'on va payer trop cher pour un plat de pâtes bof. Mais on va pouvoir faire griller notre pain et avec de la margarine aromatisée des 2 côtés! J'y suis aller pour le brunch également, rien d'épatant là non plus."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce restaurant à l'occasion de la fête d'un ami.  L'intérieur du restaurant est vraiment classe pas de fioriture qui alourdisse le décors. Le service est rapide dès lors que votre commande est passée.  J'ai trouvé le principe du bar à pain tartiné au beurre aromatisé (ail, tomate ou pesto) que l'on se fait griller sur une plaque (style barbecue) assez sympa.  J'ai pris des \"Penne Bocconciutto\" (bocconcini et prosciutto) avec sauce napolitaine et pesto rosso (tomate séché). La présentation était bien, mais je m'attendais à mieux. L'idée dans la présentation est là, mais les saveurs absentes, je n'ai pas retrouvé le bon coté de la sauce napolitaine, c'était à mon gout une simple sauce tomate.  Mes amis m'ont fait gouter ce qu'ils ont pris.  L'un a pris des \"Lasagnes Oceano\" que j'ai trouvé bonne.  L'autre a pris des \"Linguine crémeuses au gorgonzola\"  qui était tout aussi bonne.  Le dessert que mon ami m'a fait goûter un \"Torta cioccolata\" gâteau au chocolat et cerise. Était bon, mais un peu plus chaud cela aurait mieux fait ressortir les saveurs.  J'ai passé un agréable moment car j'étais avec mes amis mais la nourriture ne m'as pas tant que ça transporté en Italie.   Pour ce prix, j'aurais pu me préparer la même chose avec des pâtes fraîches et des légumes frais du marché.  Personnellement je n'y retournerai pas, à moins que se soit avec un bon groupe d'amis pour passé la soirée."}
{"text":"Pacini is a Canadian Olive Garden and I've only eaten at Pacini once, and not because it wasn't good, but because greater Montreal's gastronomic choices are limitless.  I love this north shore suburb of Montreal, which really depicts what living in a Francophone bedroom community of this great city might be like.  The feel upon entering is less Olive Garden ... but then the feel of the menu is somewhat Olive Garden ... and then the food that arrives is better than the Olive Garden.  I had an excellent dinner here, partly because I took quite a while to scour the entrees on the menu and ask some questions.  I will hold it to 4 stars but wanted to note that the service at this Saint-Jerome location that evening was 5 stars - genuinely friendly, helpful, and quick.  Pacini is mostly a Quebec chain, with an apparent location in Western Canada.  However, if it can thrive at roughly the corner of Jean Talon and Lacordaire in Montreal, LOL, then that's a good sign in and of itself."}
{"text":"After the renovation,the restaurant looks better than before!and we ordered the spaghetti in the meat sauce,and the steak,it was very good,and the special fries are so good...the service is ok,but we waited a bite long for the food!"}
{"text":"Italian food? Yes please!!  I went there with my mom and sister. It was great. we were really hungry that day. So we started off with the \"Bread Bar\" that has (4 types of breads to grill, and margarine with 3 flavors: Garlic, Tomato & Basil and Pesto).  Then I ordered from the menu: \"Mixta Pasta Generoso\" since I was craving for all of them!! In case you're not sure what's inside...read this: (Trio de linguine Alfredo, tortellini sauce rosée et spaghetti bolognese).  Yummy yummy! Right?  Anyway, the meal was super delicious. However, I topped my dish with extra cheese and mushrooms. so this might helped ;)  The ambiance was nice and the service was perfect indeed. we finished with a cute tiny \"Dolci  Dark Chocolate\" ice cream.  I would definitely recommend this resto, it's on my top 5 here in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced but a great place to go to when you want carbs. Came here after running the Montreal Marathon and that Bread Bar was a dream come true!!!  Not totally a destination to run to, but if you're in the area, it's a good place. Great for families"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est horrible. La nourriture est pas bonne, ça coute extrêmement cher pour ce que c'est, environ 20$ le plat qui est fade, et pas très gros. C'est supposément de la nourriture bien présentée avec un petit peu de persil déposé sur ton tas de pâtes (pas bonnes les pâtes bien sur), et parce que le serveur, qui s'en fout pas mal de toi, te propose de te mettre du parmesan sur ton plat (wow! quel service)  Seul point positif, le bar à pain, illimité, ça vaut la peine de prendre une entrée à 3$ et de vider le bar à pain. Par contre, si vous êtes tous seuls, ou plusieurs à faire la même chose, ils aiment pas trop.   Il y a des restaurants beaucoup mieux dans les environs pour manger quelque chose d'italien, Pizzafiore par exemple, avec de meilleurs plats, de plus grosses portions, moins cher, et avec un meilleur service.  À éviter, sérieusement."}
{"text":"My lunch was very good!! They have a special monday -friday + all you can eat bread buffet. Ordered the Pizza Molti Fromaggi was soo delicious thin crust but soft and crispy with great mozzarella and sauce. It came with choice of fries , salad ceasar or italian salad. Service was great too very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Belle endroit bon service  mais le pire filet  mignon de ma vie. Dur et sec. Très salé. Pas de légumes. ..ne vaut pas les 35$ demandés."}
{"text":"Two stars because food was good on Saturday.   We decided to go back on Sunday. Made us wait for 30 minutes (we had been only ones waiting and had checked in) just to tell us that they were going to be unable to seat us because they were backed up in the kitchen.  Good thing that we decided to ask about our table because we saw two other parties get turned away. The restaurant was not close to full. 930 amSunday."}
{"text":"Not having a data plan while roaming around Montreal left me without my trusty Yelp reviews.  Thought I would just wing it vs. planning ahead, since I discovered a great pho place for lunch.  This place is not great, but not as bad as the reviews would state.  It is a bit pricey for what you get.  The bread bar was kinda overstated - more like a toast bar.  I will be planning ahead for future meals.  I must say that servers in Montreal (here and elsewhere) are nicer than they are in the US."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you notice the modern designs and incredible detailed creativity put into this place. Clean to the T, organized and friendly staff. Attentive waitresses, and even the menus are clean, beautiful and well laid out.  Found is pure awesome. Quality ingredients, creative chinaware and perfect portions. They have bread options inside with several condiments to choose and an open grill to toast your bread. So good!  Free wifi too. Prices are fair for the great quality and selection of unique dishes you get."}
{"text":"Personnel compétent, service excellent et ambiance et environnement vraiment au top !!"}
{"text":"Food is nice and so is the restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Service was very slow for just a duck confit salad and soup so I removed a star. Bread grill is a fun unique experience and tasty butter spreads. Salad was very tasty. I would go back to try again and hope for better service."}
{"text":"Had the pesto cod over pasta. Cod was good and not dried out. Pesto flavoring was different. Side salad was just okay. It could have been from a bag.Bread bar was different. You grill the bread yourself and choose a flavored butter. If you like white bread it would be fine but the whole grain ones were more like white bread.The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Pacini was located right beside our hotel and right away we noticed gluten free.  The inside is very large and I liked the decor.  The bread toasting Station at the back was cool but no gluten free bread :(.  I had the prosciutto and arugula gluten free pizza, it was awesome!  Not the biggest portion for the price but definitely tasty!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and a lot of varieties in their food. I enjoy their bread bar and the different types of butter. My favorite is the tomato and basil spread.   The group I came with all enjoyed their food and we left with happy stomach.  The staffs were courteous and we got our orders timely and accurately.   Overall, it was an excellent evening."}
{"text":"We were looking for good Italian food and found it at Pacini. It's nothing high end or gourmet... just good, basic North American Italian fare. Absolutely no complaints with my order of Caesar salad to start and lasagna for my main. Was tasty, fresh and hot, and the salad also had great flavours and a hefty wedge of lemon on the side. They make their own croutons and provide fresh bread to start.   We were in a bit of a rush and the server was friendly and helpful. Ensured that we were in and out in the time we needed to be. What more can you ask for? Outdoor patio? Yeah, they had that, too!"}
{"text":"I've been twice with my girlfriend and we simply loved everything! the bar a pain is delicious: you can choose up to 4 types of butter (pesto, dried sun tomatoes, garlic and plain) to eat within 6 or 7 types of bread.  The food: starting by the entree, the minestrone soup was really good and it gets even better when you add some parmesan! If you like french fries, it's a must order the frites parmigiana, a mix of french fries, zucchini and onion, with a tasteful seasoning. I don't have any complains about the pizza. The dough, the sauce and the toppings were amazingly good. For the pasta, we tried spaghettini a la sauce bolognese, penne a la primavera, tortellini a la sauce rosee, linguine with shrimp a la sauce Alfredo and pesto: all full of flavor, delicious. Everything was well served, enough sauce and al dente. As a dessert, you need to try the profiteroles.   No matter if you are with your friends, your date, your wife/husband, your family or alone.... It's a very welcoming atmosphere with smiley servers."}
{"text":"Hugely overpriced, $17 bowl of pasta bolognese that had less taste and thought than cheap bottled sauces; a plate of antipasti that had a couple wedges of mozzarella, a couple artichoke heart quarters, 4-5 olives and a huge amount of salad that was the same as the separate salad we ordered, which itself was really nothing for the $15 price. a \"bread bar\" where you toast your own bread, slices of supermarket breat the give, no italian bread or baguette, and sprepd some garlic butter on it. Service very slow for the lack of customers, no one greeted us on entering, we had to go find them. Nice atmosphere though. Not worth it by any measure."}
{"text":"La nourriture était bonne. Mais il y avait plein de petites choses qui ne m'a pas plus dans mon experience. Le service était seulement correct. Le menu difficile à lire et cela de plusieurs façons. L'ambiance ennuyante. Même dans la salle de bain, il n'y avait rien pour s'assécher les mains."}
{"text":"Sans plus rien de wow nourriture sans goût nouveau bonne ambiance en famille mais réserver lors du dimanche car cest full ligne d'attente... Bon service mais les plat trop dispendieux pour le manque de saveur ... Déçu mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Design, décor, ambiance vraiment très réussi, par contre côté cuisine et service il y a bcp d'améliorations à apporter. Commandé cannelloni et pizza et les 2 plats n'avaient aucun goût,  très fade, obligé de rajouter bcp de sel et poivre et huile d'olive. 2 étoiles juste pour le côté esthétique du restaurant"}
{"text":"Joli décor, service vraiment agréable. Le bar a pain est toujours un succès. J'avais pris du fettuccini alfredo, il était juste correct, je ne goutais pas vraiment la sauce. Ma mère avait pris des tortellini a la sauce rosée, ils étaient vraiment bon, elle a apprécié. Mon ami avait pris de la pizza piquante, mais pas assez piquante a son gout (mais je suis sur que pour quelqu'un autre ca lui brûlerait la bouche :P) J'y retournerais c'est sûr, mais pas de fettuccini alfredo cette fois ci. C'est a essayer, le bar a pain en vaut la peine. Choisir son pain (4 differents) son beurre (4 differents) et le faire griller soi meme sur le grill. A la fin du repas, la facture est accompagnée de cerises marasquin trempées dans du chocolat au lait. L'expérience Pacini quoi!"}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance pour les soirées entre amis. Le services est sympatique et les plats classiques."}
{"text":"Nous étions des habitués du pacini sur St Denis, le bar à pain nous enchantait et amusait les enfants. Toutefois au fil des années nous avons observés le déclin de cette succursale et j'espère qu'ils se reprendront en main. La nourriture n'est plus aussi savoureuse, la croûte de la pizza soit trop cuite ou trop molle par excès de sauce. Les pâtes juste correctes. Pour un restaurant italien ça fait pitié. Et que dire du service. Une des dames qui y travaille depuis trop longtemps est rude et maladroite sur tous les niveaux tant son langage que son service. Nous n'y allons plus car nous ne voyons pas l'intérêt de payer si cher pour si peu de qualité. À quelques mètres se trouve la pizzeria dei compari qui offre une nourriture succulente (pizza au four à bois et pâtes de toutes sortes) pour moins de 20$ avec un service efficace. Il faudrait peut être s'en inspirer...."}
{"text":"Très décevant! Je me suis rendue à ce resto avec mon copain vendredi soir puisque nous avions un événement dans le coin et que nous ne savions pas où aller. En arrivant, nous sommes allés au bar à pain. A ce propos, rien d'intéressant à signaler! Sauf qu'il y avait un énorme câble dans lequel il était vraiment facile de s'enfarger en y allant! Vraiment dangereux!!!   En entrée, mon copain a pris une salade César. Vraiment très décevante. Un gros 7,50$ pour une mini portion de salade sans goût et noyée dans sa vinaigrette.   En plat principal, j'ai pris le duo de pizza fromage de chèvre et spaghetti sauce bolognese. Le plat était bon, mais sans plus. La pizza était vraiment très salée.  Mon copain a pris la pizza \"carne\". Mêmes commentaires.   Au dessert, j'ai demandé conseil à la serveuse entre le dolci et le panna cotta, mais elle n'a pas pu m'aider puisqu'elle n'avait jamais goûté le panna cotta. Je l'ai tout de même essayé. Plus grosse déception de la soirée. Je ne l'ai pas mangé.  Même chose pour mon copain et son tiramisu. Manqué sur toute la ligne. 7$ par dessert, c'était beaucoup trop.   Je ne vous recommande pas ce resto. Ça vous coûtera cher pour rien."}
{"text":"I know Pacini mainly for their unlimited bread bar,  where you can grill your own slices of toast with different buttery spreads like garlic, tomato or pesto. I hadn't been to this chain in almost ten years and I'm glad that hasn't changed. However there has been some significant renovations. I believe all Pacini restaurants have undergone the makeover, more booths, comfy sofas and a very elegant, classy vibe.   This St Jerome location is charming, located in an old building near the river, it reminds me of being in the Old Port of Montreal or old Quebec City.   This is a great place to be on a date, have an intimate party or just relax, their terrace is also huge and the environment is peaceful. Don't come here so much for the food. The portions are on the smaller side, and the sauces really plain. I had the Alfredo which tasted like cream, but without parmesan, I had to add so much salt. My bf had the tomato sauce pasta and that was equally lacking in flavor.  The Pacini brand has opted for a new menu that is a lot more health conscious, as one can read about on their website. On the main page you will see the face of their nutritionist spokesperson. They have cut out all transfat, lots of salt and any unnecessary additives. Unfortunately that has been the cut back in taste. Perhaps their more expensive dishes such as veal, duck risotto or steaks would be more appealing.   They used to serve free soup or salad- that has been eliminated, even their trademarked chocolate covered cherries at the end of the meal have disappeared.   Nice place to hang out, come here if you love the unlimited bread like I do, it's so fresh and actually better than the main dishes. You can get a cheap lunch option for less than 12$, then it becomes worth it.  Btw, they have a good birthday discount. The percentage of discount you get is equivalent to your age! I can picture lots of old folks coming and getting an almost free meal of their choice."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and ambiance but needs improvement in service. There were a numbers of servers but we were consistently waiting for drinks and food. Our table all ordered the table hôte and service from start to finish took nearly 3h. A bit long for our liking. Food was excellent overall."}
{"text":"If I had the choice between cafeteria food from my elementary school or Pacini's I'd go with the first one. The service isn't terrible nor was the decor but the food left me questioning. How can garlic snail taste so empty? What's also sad was that my bolognese lasagna tasted like it came from a buffet. They weren't inedible but they were plain. I've had many frozen lasagne that were better. I expected a lot more from a $20 dish. On the bright side, the desserts were okay. I can't seem to remember one among three of the desserts I've tried though. Let's just say that they weren't really memorable but what I can recall was that they weren't bad.   For me, the food is mediocre at best. I certainly wouldn't come back unless someone I know really wants to go to this place and is paying for my meal."}
{"text":"Funny story. My husband and I went in one day initially for lunch. We sat down and looked at the menu. It was a Sunday, so from what we saw the lunch type meals were not available. The bread bar was not open at this time either. The place was pretty much dead. We really didn't feel like having a full meal dinner-style so we left without ordering, but only to go back that same night for dinner!   There are plenty of options that are interesting and delicious for DINNER, but I would not advise that you visit this resto for lunch on the weekend during the daytime, unless you are looking for dinner during the day. They serve breakfast I believe on the weekends and I have a feeling it's really good but we haven't been there for breakfast yet.   The bread bar is a cool concept but it is only sliced bread that is offered which looks bizarre and renders you slightly disappointed. Assorted buns and rolls or some different types of bread would really make it great. The food was quite good I have to say, my husband was happy too. His steak was slightly over-cooked though. He asked for Medium-Rare but it was more Medium-Well. One other thing, the music was good but much TOO LOUD.   Their birthday policy is applicable the day before, the day of, as well as the day after your birthday and you get your age discounted off your meal. Sunday was the day after my husband's birthday so he got 39% off his main meal. To take advantage of this be sure to bring ID because they do ask for it."}
{"text":"Again, a great meal in Montreal!  Our last breakfast in Montreal was at Pacini's.  We'd gone there just to check it out - didn't know anything beforehand.  We weren't sure breakfast was served there, but then noticed it opened at 7am.  Wow.  We were told to sit anywhere we'd like, so we chose a nice little table near the front window.  The menu was nice and we both found several things that we could see ourselves eating.  I ordered something that was a cross between an omelette and crepes, but had \"lasagna\" in the title, and looked kinda' like manicotti.... I dunno but it was AMAZING!  I also ordered an orange juice (came in a wine glass) and my breakfast was served with a shot of a delicious health drink of some sort.  My girlfriend had the same shot served with her meal, and ordered a nice fruit breakfast with an over-easy egg on top of toast (yum!) and some \"goat cheese apple crumble\" - mmmmm.  Everything we ate tasted great and I couldn't finish mine though because it was so huge!  Our bill in all came to under $25.  This included a \"bread bar\" where you can select any number of bread slices from a nice variety (try the raisin ones!) and then butter, jam etc... to go on top.  The server was nice and the food came fast.  The restaurant looked very nice and clean as well.  I'd love to try this place for lunch or dinner... or just come back for another delicious breakfast!  It's right on Saint-Denis too, so very convenient!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend wanted Italian.  So onto Yelp I went. After a brief search in my favourite style....what's closest to me, this restaurant appeared.  Although the online menu was only in French, we managed to decipher it enough to figure out they had what she wanted.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted in both French and English by staff.  Immediately seated by a window, and given menus, in (thank goodness) English and French. We ordered a bottle of wine, along with a spicy penne for myself and a chicken Alfredo for my girlfriend.  Food arrived in a very reasonable time.  My first impression of the food was that it smelled amazing, closely followed by tasting exactly as it smells.  My penne was amazing, not overly spicy, but enough to keep the tastebuds awake.  The chicken on the Alfredo, was fall apart tender. Staff were attentive, but not overbearing. Made sure our wine and water glasses were both kept topped up. The only reason for the four star would be that the decor was a little worn and dated in places.  I wouldn't let that stop me from eating there again."}
{"text":"Pacini was conveniently located right next to the hotel my friends and I were staying at. However, the food was forgettable. I tried the Spaghetti Bolognese with an Italian Meatball. The meat sauce was bland and the meatball was dry. Additionally the service was excruciatingly slow even though there was barely anyone in the restaurant. Skip this restaurant; there are many more options nearby."}
{"text":"it was right downstairs from our hotel, so we thought we'd grab a bite before setting out. went into the restaurant mid-day (1 or 1:30pm?), there were people there but the place was not full. however, we stood there for nearly 5 minutes and saw the two staff busying themselves with a bill or some other kind of business. either they didn't see us at all, or just didn't want to see us. either way, that was bad service even before we could sit down!  so we left and went to kilo next door--it's cheaper and probably better too."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. A nice small place where a LOT of people seemed to have been celebrating their birthdays; every 5 minutes it seemed they were bringing cake out to someone! That aside, the decor and ambiance and warm and welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and made sure we always had water on the table. Many restaurants have a soup and salad bar, but this place has an all you can eat bread bar; you can grill your own choice of bread (white, brown, sesame, etc), with your choice of spreads (butter, garlic butter, pesto spread, etc). Better than just having a bread basket put on the table I guess. My boyfriend Danny and I had ordered a pitcher of Stella, and were pretty disappointed at how watered down it was, considering we were paying 20$ for it. After everyone had ordered, plates started to come out all at the same time, except for mine, it seemed. 10, 15, even 20 minutes went by with nothing sitting in front of me. I was baffled because I had ordered what seemed to be the simplest thing on the menu - margherita pizza. Finally, 25 minutes later, I had a piping hot pizza sitting in front of me, with a free pint of Stella for my troubles - a nice touch. The pizza was good, nothing overly amazing though (read: it was no Lombardi's). In all, it was satisfying, but doesn't stand out in my mind."}
