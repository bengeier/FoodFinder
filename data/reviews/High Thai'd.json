{"text":"Quick, tasty, authentic, nice.  Awesome."}
{"text":"My girl and I were in a pinch trying to find a Thai restaurant open late and with 15 minutes till closing the staff were happy to seat us and the service was attentive and quick. I always judge Thai and sushi joints by their seaweed salad (i dont know why but if its bad my meal is ruined)  and it certainly passed the test. Taking the advice of the waitress I got the Coventry Rd. Curry. It was delightful. Not quite as spicy as I had hoped, but delicious all the same. With every type of sea creature and wild mushrooms, peppers and onions in curry sauce, this plate was a winner. I'll be back soon to try their sushi, which I'm sure will be excellent judging by the freshness and quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Decent place for Cleveland...however they might be stretching themselves a little thin by going down the path of Asian fusion.  Sweet potato in masaman curry? Interesting, but doesn''t work in the already sweet coconut curry type of dish.  Look at the ingredients listed in the menu, avoid the sushi, stick to the traditional Thai fare and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh! Everyone is extremely friendly and more than happy to deal with the vegetarian modifications we make, which is so nice and such a big deal! Try the vegetable tempura to start; and definitely go for any of the flavorful fried rice dishes! Also a great option for takeout if you live in the area! Service is sometimes a little slow when you dine in, but they are all still very nice."}
{"text":"Meh. Going downhill. They seem to be cutting more and more corners on food quality. Curries with fewer pieces of seafood/smaller pieces. Noodles clumpy. A lemon slice instead of lime with my Pad Thai?! It's all starting to feel a bit cheap and crappy, especially for the price. 

Service has become lackluster, so we've started doing take-out instead of dine-in (why pay an extra 20% if you're not getting anything for it?). But even that has been frustrating. The last two times I called, they told me it would be \"10 minutes\" for the food to be ready, but it took almost 35 minutes on one visit, and over 25 on the next. Boo! I have wanted to be enthusiastic about this place--after all, it's walking distance from my house, and I love Thai food. But it's lame enough at this point that I'd rather drive somewhere else rather than eat here. Coventry deserves better."}
{"text":"Great, if not a little expensive. I had the Avocado Curry (A+) and my friend had the Chicken Pineapple which he raved about. We also had the pot stickers which weren't bad. Nice little restaurant and pleasant service."}
{"text":"High Thai'd has a stupid name.  True.  What do you expect for Coventry?

However, the food at High Thai'd is as good as it was at Mint.  The service is better.  They are NICE.  This is not fancy, it is just good.

Great carryout service, great table service.  This restaraunt makes Coventry Village work."}
{"text":"I went there couple times, I think their Pad thai and tamarind duck are pretty awesome! my friend like red curry a lot. 
overall, good taste, good service, reasonable price. nice ambiance. easy to find parking nearby."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! The curries are insanely good, and they have very good bubble tea options too. I have eaten here so many times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Part of me feels like I shouldn't review this restaurant because I've only ordered 1 entree each of the 3 timed I've dined there. 

But I'm bored, procrastinating and still thinking about how good the Duck Choo Chee is.

To keep it simple, Thai is one of my faves and I've had enough average Thai food to last me the rest of my life...to the point that I'm often skeptical to try a new place for fear of disappointment.  For me, the true test are a places Tom Yon Goong (I'm sure that I spelled some of that wrong) and the Duck Choo Chee.

During my first visit, both dishes were hot, spicy, well prepared and in reasonable portion sizes (for lunch). The price is right, the location is convenient and I'll eat there again.

I guess I'll get ready for work now..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland.  Food is delicious and pricing is fair.  Their pad thai is delicious and so is the mango sticky rice (when they have fresh mangoes in stock)."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place and it is fabulous!!! I always get their regular pad Thai a little extra spicy (they have a 5 star system) and have really never been disappointed, which is saying something since I'm a regular. I've also had the chicken satay and spring rolls, which were both great as well. The staff is extremely friendly and prices aren't bad for the amount of food you get. Overall an amazing place - and they have really speedy take out."}
{"text":"I was starving and ready to eat almost anything - I'm glad I stopped in here.  I was cold and quickly was served a nice mug of hot jasmine tea.  I was still cold so I ordered soup... Vegetable pho.  Which was flavorful, fresh and yummy. The service was timely and polite and the decor pleasant.  My overall experience was very good and I look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"High Thai'd just happens to be in the same location as Mint Cafe, with the same menu, and the same decor. But, apparently, it's under new ownership, with a new chef. I asked if the menu would be changing too, and they indicated that it would not, but the new chef does cook some dishes slightly differently.

We are (were) diehard fans of Mint Cafe, so I was holding my breath the whole time. I can say that the two dishes we got tasted basically as I remembered them. The Masaman Curry has wonderful chunks of sweet potato that melt in your mouth. The 'ginger ginger' dish may have tasted a bit more chinese than I remember, but was still delicious. Next time, we'll have to try the ever important Country Style Pad Thai. I fell in love with thai food in Chicago, and the only pad thai in Cleveland that tastes anything like that is the Country Style. 

The service was friendly, but rushed and uneven - but I seem to remember that at Mint Cafe, too. We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered the country style pad Thai, friends ordered the pad see ew, chili duck, and lemon grass chicken. First of all my friend who ordered the pad see ew actually received crazy noodles...I requested my dish to be extra spicy and it was not. Pad Thai, even if not requested to be extra spicy, should still be spicy, which it also was not. The chili duck didn't have spice, it was basically just sweet. Although the mistake on the dish and the failure to receive any sort of spiciness to our dishes, they were actually quite good. It's about average prices for a restaurant and definitely good sized portions, bigger than I expected. It was the first time I tried duck...very tasty. Two of us ordered green tea bubble tea which was great, while the other friend had the honey dew bubble tea. I definitely want to come here again, but I'll be sure to make my point across about being spicy! I'd recommend coming here. Try it out."}
{"text":"I've been a here a few times since it changed from being Mint and while some of the dishes I've ordered have been okay, my last order of Country Pad Thai has to be the worst version I've ever had. It was not spicy, at all, it had zero depth of flavor, and the tofu's texture was dry and overdone. It pretty much sealed the deal on me never going back, unless friends drag me. I have enjoyed the Mango Fried Rice in the past, but otherwise I'm not impressed. I would go down the street to Tree Country Bistro or drive to Peppermint in Lander Circle."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely delicious. The food is so fresh and the flavors are well blended. Their wings are fried in ginger and are incredible. Fast service and great staff. This is my go to place for dinner any time."}
{"text":"Update:

The avocado curry is a new favorite for me! Sweet, flavorful, and not too spicy - qualities I look for in curry. The golden bags appetizer is amazing too! It comes with a really tasty sauce. I was really tempted to guzzle it down.

The food, service, atmosphere, price, and cleanliness are still great here. I'm really looking forward to trying more menu items.  The staff is especially friendly and fun to converse with while waiting :D"}
{"text":"It's no different from Mint Cafe in terms of food. However, the decor is great. My favorite curries and noodle dishes are still on the menu, so no complaints from me.

The new sushi options are ok - too overpriced. However, the new bubble tea is great!

Service is much better than Mint Cafe."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Best Thai in Cleveland.  It started with a tom ka gai that was rich and thick, a perfectly spiced heaven in a bowl.  Choo chi duck was excellent as well, and the rest of my party had excellent entrees too.  I've had this menu pairing all around the world and this was the best I remember."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times so far. The food is pretty good, but speed is unreliable. Today I went with a group and we waited over an hour for food.

On food: I order the high thai'd fried rice every time because I am a fussy five year old. The rice itself is good, and I like the onions, shrimp, and peppers. It has chicken and peas that are kind of mediocre. I've heard recommendations about their Pad Thai, but no ringing endorsements of their Pad See Ew and curry dishes.

On the wait: I've only eaten dinner on weekends here, semi-busy each time. I've had a 15min wait, a 30min wait, and I just had a 1hour 10min wait. That runs the gamut from acceptable to comically ridiculous.

Price is about $10."}
{"text":"amazing smoothie to accompany your meal. food tastes great, not the hugest quantity but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with my last order. Ordered the panang chicken, it was loaded with green beans and barely any chicken It had 4 slivers of green peepers and literally a slice of a mushroom...  I would be embarrassed if I served someone this dish. I did however like the fast pick up time after I ordered and the veggie rolls are yummy."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian selection. The tofu green curry was delicious!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Indonesian fried rice was to die for! So flavorful and portion was big enough for leftovers the next day. Thai iced tie was a little too sweet, but i guess most places that use the syrup are like that. Would definitely come back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I think my review might be biased.

I used to adore Mint Cafe and while High Thai'd is very much like Mint Cafe, I feel something is missing.  The decor is similar, the tables are all in the same places, the workers are the same, the food is even ALMOST the same. Yet, I wasn't in love. My old regular, Pineapple Chicken, was a little soupier, rather than having a thick sauce, but it was still tasty. The service was still great. 

My main issue is the name. I don't mean to sound awful or critical, but the name is a bit cheesy. And by a bit cheesy, I mean that apostrophe is totally inappropriate! A large portion of this complaint is in jest, but, for real: it bothers me."}
{"text":"I love Sushi from here, very tasty and fresh!!! I recommend Sushi Cake Roll very yummy.I give 5/5 for Sushi^^.Best Sushi in Cleveland confirm!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD:
Great Thai food, and one of the best in Cleveland. So, I come here often when I have a carving for some Thai. I always get the Country Pad Thai and the Chicken Satay. They are delicious! The bubble tea is not bad, especially since there aren't  many places that serve it in Cleveland. 

They just started serving sushi not that long ago, and I would stick with the just Thai food when coming. If you want Japanese, go to Pacific East down the block. 

SERVICE:
Always nice and friendly. Never had any problems there."}
{"text":"We were looking for some thai food and most other places were closed. We ordered Pad Thai and Avocado Curry, Summer Rolls, and few beers.
Both of the entrees where okay, nothing special. Both were lacking the complexity that I am used to having in Thai food. The curry sauce was delicious, but the chicken had clearly not been cooked in the sauce and was a little bland, the veggies were fresh and still had a crunch which I really like. 
The summer rolls were not at all what was described on the menu, they were deep fried with some type of filling. Not sure if this was just a miscommunication but we didn't bother to send them back. We got everything we had ordered before we got our drinks which was weird, I think our waitress had forgotten about them. Besides that she was very sweet. 
Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The massaman curry is quite tasty. Gluten free friendly. Only downside is that our meals have been on the slower side to arrive the last couple times we visited... wait staff is excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this restaurant. Five years ago before moving away, we used to go to Mint Cafe. We loved it. Was our favorite Thai restaurant in all of Cleveland. However, this restaurant is nothing like Mint café. I don't think it has been cleaned since Mint closed it's doors. It's very sad to me because they have the bones--the food was pretty good, but it's just too dirty for me. I will just continue to go to Peppermint Thai."}
{"text":"Took my cousins kids here, two students at CWRU, and had a great time. Food was fresh and filling, with great service and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was a die-hard fan of Mint Cafe, with their delicious appetizers and pad thai. When they closed, it was like a little part of me had died. I'm so glad they reopened, even if it is under a new name. The food is actually a little bit cheaper now, so I'm not complaining at all.

The appetizers and bubble tea are good. I've had both the black milk and honeydew tea, and they're great. For apps, I've had the tofu triangles, spring rolls, summer rolls, and vegetable tempura. You can't really go wrong with any of those options. My favorite is the peanut sauce that comes as a side to some of those apps. It's so good!

I've rarely strayed from my pad thai main course. Country pad thai, medium spicy, with tofu and veggies (minus the fish sauce). They are so accommodating to vegetarians here, even making sure if you want fish sauce or eggs. The food also comes in huge portions, and lasts at least two or three meals. 

The service is a little bit slow at times, taking a while to get your food and refill your water. Also, one downfall is that they don't split checks. Unfortunately, I found this out after 15 of my friends and I had dinner. It was quite hectic sitting at the table for another 30 minutes figuring out who owed what."}
{"text":"Kinda Meh. Dishes lack flavor and the vegetables tend to be a little overcooked. It seems very americanized and not very authentic thai tasting compared to what I've had elsewhere.  The service and the people are nice enough. It's just a little over-priced for what you're getting considering I think I could probably make something a little better at home."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm. Came here for a late night dinner and left satisfied. 

I saw the Pad See Ew and was sold. I also ordered the taro bubble tea out of curiosity since I'm trying to find a boba place in Cleveland that I like. The bubble tea came in smoothie forms, not like milk tea. We came about an hour before closing and were seated right  away - ordered within about 5-10 minutes of being seated. Our waiter was very attentive and quick with our orders. We got our drinks first - I tried the honeydew (very sweet for those who have a sweet tooth) and the thai iced tea was delicious. The taro bubble tea was amazing! My only reservations about the bubble tea were the pearls themselves. They weren't chewy and too soft but I suspect that's because we came before closing and got the last of the pearls. The portion size of our food was just right and enough to take half home though it was delicious enough to finish in one sitting. I like my food spicy but wasn't sure about the levels here so I got a 3/5 on the spice rating. They included extra spice seasonings on the side in case we wanted to add more - I added a good spoonful extra to get my spice fill. The Pad See Ew included shrimp and chicken, both of which were delightfully moist and not overcooked. I also tried the Pad Thai and definitely would have added more spice to it (or ordered the Country Pad Thai). It had a bit more lime than I would have liked but it was still tasty. Currently craving more Pad See Ew - hope I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but I would say not as well done as their predecessor, Mint Cafe. They have your typical Thai fare, so be prepared for some glistening noodles. The spices are pretty good, but nothing is astonishing. 

I do like coming here for lunch though because the prices are not bad. Sushi here is clean, but not fancy. You won't get sick, but you don't get that much pizazz either. For a lunch time meal, unless you're requesting a lot of flair, this is not bad. 

But do be careful of time. The service is not always the most timely, but the staff is very nice and willing to accomodate."}
{"text":"I am on a quest to find the best pad Thai in Cleveland. This would definitely be in the top 5. The chicken was not dry and the shrimp was not overcooked. They offer spicy and mild pad thai. The thing is that the mild pad Thai was too bland. My boyfriend got a spicy pad Thai eating of 3 on a 7 point scale and it was the perfect amount of spice and it wasn't even spicy. I recommend getting a 3 or 4 if you're not into spicy things. Also it took awhile for the waitress to get our drinks (water) but our food came out really fast so that made up for it."}
{"text":"I'll try not to be biased since I loved Mint Cafe... but High Thai'd was just ok. 

We ordered the beef satay to start, and both the sauces were too sweet and not savory. We both got country pad thai (medium spicy) and though it was satisfying, the flavor was still a little on the sweet side. The pro was that the portions are pretty much the same and pretty filling. Other pros were that the waitstaff was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is great spot to grab some thai.
Everybody that works here is friendly and nice. I've never had to wait for a long time, and I've been here a few times. I like the location on Coventry- I've grabbed food here a few times and then walked across the street to the coffee shop and done work. Also you could always grab a bit here with friends and then go out for drinks. I've tried a few different things on the menu and would recommend the country style pad thai. Good stuff. 

The only reason I give it a 4/5 instead a 5/5 is the prices....it's really not that bad, especially in comparison to other places in Cleveland- probably a little less expensive actually...
But I guess I'm spoiled from being living in Philly in the past and experiencing eating in a restaurant city...you could find just as good food in Philly for less expensive prices, etc.
Anyways don't let that stop you from coming here! It's a great place, highly recommended! Prices aren't bad, I swear!"}
{"text":"There is a huge difference between their take out items and the same dine-in items. I've ordered the Jade Noodle from here several times while dining in, but when I order take outs of the same dish, they use a much thinner noodle and give you a lot less. What a ripe off :( 

Nevertheless, I still like coming here. My favorite dishes are the jade noodle, country pad thai, and pad see ew. 

By the way, all their items are $1 more expensive for dinner, so try to come here for lunch if you can to save some money!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here since it changed over from Mint Cafe.   The Pad Thai Country Style is still exceptional, and the service was great. I highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place changed over from Mint Cafe to High Thai'd. Checked it out and it wasn't the same. Took a few years off before I decided to try it again and it is worse than I could have imagined. County Pad Thai was bland, no seasonings at all. Chicken was tough and plain. Won't be coming back ever. How does a Thai place mess up Pad Thai?"}
{"text":"I have discovered the avocado curry, and it alone deserves a boost back to five stars. The service is always great here, too. I've had my ups and downs with High Thai'd but we're back at a good place! 

Also, the pot stickers."}
{"text":"High Thai'd is generally hit or miss, although even a miss is never bad. The flavors are either bold and bright, or a bit bland, depending on the day. The fish and meat are always fresh, though, and takeout is ready quickly. I prefer this to Tree Country, which is frequently bland and the meat tastes and feels like it's been cooked and reheated over several days. High Thai'd is cheaper and tastier, and our favorite for a local meal on a Friday night of Netflix on the couch."}
{"text":"Clever name, High Thai'd. 

Pretty damn tasty food at this joint. I'd say the menu is perhaps a bit too large. There's nothing I dislike more than a giant menu. And also, the fact that they serve Japanese (including sushi) is a bit strange to me as well. But whatevs... the Thai food that I had was delicious. I always have SOMETHING to bitch about. 

The seafood coconut soup was pretty much the bomb. Also, the red curry. Spiced perfectly. The portions were gigantic so you'll most likely be taking food home.

Great service.

I agree with what most others said -- everything is pretty similar to the previous business that was located here, Mint Cafe."}
{"text":"Very good country phad thai and rainbow sushi rolls. we come here a lot- quick service, nice atmosphere, good food."}
{"text":"This place was a bummer. The interior was drab and uninviting, the service was lukewarm at best, and my dish was the saddest, most depressing pad thai I've ever eaten. There was no spice or flavoring in the noodles at all. Normally, I have to request a spice rack to enhance my pad thai; this time, I had to ask for it to make it taste like anything. To make matters worse, the chicken and shrimp in the dish looked a little underdone, so I avoided eating the meat. Nonetheless, my stomach has felt a little queasy since I ate there, and I can't rule out the food as the cause. I really wouldn't recommend this place. It just wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch on a Saturday. The place was empty when we got there, but a few parties came in after we sat down.

Service was quick and the employees were all very friendly; however, the food itself was pretty meh. I ordered the Chicken Pad See Ew at a 3 star spice level. At other Thai places such as Banana Blossom or Peppermint Thai, 3 stars offers a decent kick, but at High Thai'd, I could barely taste the spice at all. I ended up heaping chili sauce into my dish to compensate, but it still wasn't spicy enough for my taste. Other than the lack of spice, the dish was also a bit too greasy for me and there were only a few pieces of chicken (though the chicken was very juicy and tender).

In short, this place isn't terrible, but there are certainly better Thai places around."}
{"text":"While I was sitting at the bar looking at some of the really nice sushi pics on the page, a waiter was looking over my shoulder and said \"wow, those look really nice\". When I told him they were from his restaurant,  he said \" oh, so sorry, we don't have sushi anymore,  we haven't had it for over a year\". 
Maybe someone should take down the gorgeous sushi pics? 
I did have the \"devil wings\", which were not very devilish in terms of heat, but,  had good flavor and an awesome crunch."}
{"text":"Being in this restaurant was like living a nightmare.  My group left before we even ordered.  There was no one in the place at all when we got there.  The waiter was reading but there were dirty tables everywhere.  We were there for about 3 minutes and I saw a cockroach run across the wall.  My friends and I were on the fence at that point, but we hadn't decided to leave yet.  As I was noticing how dirty the menu was my friend yelled and hit me with his menu.  A cockroach had crawled up my leg or chair and had crawled all the way up my arm and was on my shoulder.  We left immediately."}
{"text":"Went to High Thai'd on a week night for dinner with some friends. I personally wasn't too impressed with the food. Not to say that the food was terrible, but given the decent number of good to excellent Asian restaurants I've visited in Cleveland, I can't particularly say I'd want to return here. Additionally, this place is probably priced the same if not higher than other places on Coventry. I had the duck penang curry and one of the spring roll appetizers. I was not a fan of having the duck skin still on the duck pieces in the curry, and I can't say they tasted particularly fresh. The service was not a good sell either; with a mistake in my appetizer order after making it clear 2-3 times that I wanted to exclude the shrimp. This place seems to be a college student hotspot, which might explain why it gets by while being subpar."}
{"text":"High Thai'd Rock Bottom?! WUT?

How clever... especially since High Tide is closed. 
Weird... whatever

Mint Cafe was pretty darn good. High Thai'd is pretty much the same joint. Everything I have had here tastes pretty identical to Mint. Pad Thai, Green Curry. I couldn't tell the difference. Still have some of the best Bubble Tea!

They say it's a different owner. Maybe it's Mint's brother."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the food was really quick.  The food was excellent!  We had 3 different dishes (mango fried rice, beef masaman, and pad thai) and we loved each of them!  We highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The best thing about High Thai'd is that they're consistent. It's not the best Thai food that I've ever had, but no where near the worst. The vegetarian dumplings are delicious and so is the dipping sauce that they come with. I've tried a few entrees, and they've all been alright. My boyfriend always orders the Country Style Pad Thai. which he enjoys. I also like that they deliver, even if it is via Food Fetchers."}
{"text":"I ordered the High Thai'd Fried rice and my friend ordered the Massaman curry. We also ordered their High Thai'd shrimp and chicken spring rolls. I've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants, and I have to say this was one of the best experiences I've ever had. All the food we ate were superb and delicious. I wasn't expecting much from the spring rolls, but I was surprised at how much the crispiness of the shell balanced the fresh, juicy shrimp and vegetables. It was so delicious. My fried rice was extremely flavorful and all the spices and meats really came together synergistically to enhance the dish. It wasn't greasy or flat, and I have eaten a lot of fried rices. It was just the right mix of heavy and fresh ingredients. However, I do wish I had asked for extra spicy instead of medium spicy. My fried rice could have used just a little kick but i think that was me not being aware of the spice levels. It was an extremely awesome experience except for the fact that they charged my friend an extra $1.35 for extra white rice for his curry and they bring you just a tiny cup. I thought that was a huge rip off. Most places don't charge you for extra rice and if they do it's never more than $. 50. Just be aware and either don't ask for extra rice or know that you will get gypped."}
{"text":"A group of us came here on a random Wednesday night. High Thai'd was able to initially accommodate our large party. Food and beverage came out in a snap.  But the rate limiting step of this meal was getting the check.  

As for the food, I ordered the country pad Thai which as tasty.  The dish was surprisingly spicy (a good thing)  but may be a surprise to those who are unsuspecting.  This is not the best Thai food that I have ever experienced, but I certainly would not hesitate to come back again if craving Thai and limited to Cleveland area.  There were also a variety of bubble teas and specialty drinks which looked tasty as well as Japanese and Chinese entrees on the menu.   The pricing is very reasonable. 

3.5 stars for food. 
2.5 stars for service."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place! The man who I believe to be the owner (or is at least a manager) is incredibly kind and always remembers my boyfriend and me, and has offered us free Thai iced tea while we waited for our large take-out order to be ready and upgraded our regular bubble teas to slushy bubble teas as a thank you for being regular customers. Aside from his generosity, the food is consistently delicious. High Thai'd is always my top choice when I want to eat out."}
{"text":"Such an unexpected surprise to find great Thai food on Coventry! We planned to visit another restaurant on the street and found it closed so we headed to High Thai'd instead. They weren't super busy but had several full tables on Friday night. It seemed like several tables ordered at once so it wasn't the fastest service but our food didn't take too long and clearly care out hot and fresh. My husband and I split the vegetable and tofu pad Thai, that had a ton of veggies and super crispy tofu, and the red curry with chicken. We ordered the curry spicy and it was, so flavorful and balanced with broccoli, green beans, eggplant, carrots, bamboo, and chicken. The portion was large and filling. That with the pad Thai made for total comfort food and we left full and happy for a cold night. I've been to Thailand and can say that I was really pleased with our meal here. I look forward to becoming regulars to dine in and carry out!"}
{"text":"Love High Thai'd.  Customer service is always great and the portions and taste are right where they should be.  Recommend the Country Style Pad Thai and the Avocado Curry. Both house favorites and deservedly so."}
{"text":"Ok, the people who gave this place 3 or more stars, I have one question for you: do you really feel that the food here is spicy enough?  I don't.   As someone who has lived in Thailand (Bangkok specifically, for a short time), I found the food here to be really lacking in spice and authenticity.  I felt like everything had been de-spiced as if to say that just because you live in Cleveland, you don't like spicy.  We want our spice, high Thai'd, give us the spice, gotta have that spice!!

And I also found that the food here was more expensive than it needs to be.  $14 for a dinner portion of noddles with shrimp?  Really?"}
{"text":"Always my first stop when I'm in Cleveland. This place is a hidden gem.
The crab on mango salsa appetizer is amazing. Best Panang Curry I have ever had. The Cold Thai tea is delicious. The sushi is huge. The staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting High Thai'd, and it was great! My fiancé and I both got the High Thai'd Mojito, and we both agreed it was the best mojito either of us had ever had. We split the Potstickers, which only came with five, but they were tasty. He got the Indonesian Fried Rice and I had the Crazy Noodles - both were delicious. Our server was very attentive. Without a doubt, we will be back!"}
{"text":"It was typical Thai food.  I had the avocado curry and it was good, but I wouldn't make a special trip.  They have a sushi bar and service was quick.  There were lots of Asian people eating there and so I think that gives them some \"cred\"."}
{"text":"While visting in Cleveland this past weekend, two of my friends and I stumbled upon High Thai'd. We ordered three different meals and shared them all and they were all DELICIOUS! Very tasty, full of flavor and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I know that we will go back in the near future."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai food in Cleveland. Only place you can get truly spicy Thai food with nampla on request. All of their curries and entrees are uniquely flavored and well portioned. Must try for anyone looking for high quality food with enough meat/seafood at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Storms all night kept me awake - but I finally got a bit of sleep.  I got up early to return the rental truck, finished packing up my motorcycle, put on my gear and kissed my mother goodbye.  I headed to Cleveland Heights to meet one of my best high school friends for lunch - with a short side trip to Ferrara's - and arrived at the front door of Tommy's only to discover:  CLOSED.  Apparently, Coventry suffered quite a power loss - and the folks at Tommy's (which serves breakfast) decided to take the rest of the day off!

Fortunately for my friend and me - the staff of High Thai don't serve breakfast and the power was restored before noon.  Eric and I had a most excellent lunch here - and I was able to park my motorcycle within view of our seats at the front of the restaurant.

Friendly staff who were helpful in determining whether the curry was vegan friendly (no Nam Pla upon request).

We had the crispy tofu triangles (fried tofu is essential fuel for the solo motorcycle traveler!) and we also had some green beans & tofu and some delicious curry.  All the food  was quite excellent.  The noise level in the restaurant was not at all bad - we were able to talk and work out routes from Cleveland Hts so I could avoid the freeways and it seems like every young waiter at High Thai came up to pay his respects and give me his wishes for a safe trip once they realized that the fully loaded motorcycle was mine.  Several of them said they wished they could be making my trip!

What a sweet send off from Cleveland!  Excellent company, delicious food and super polite, professional and friendly service.  I look forward to returning here again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Again, its just one of those restaurants that has a million items on their menu and everything tastes blah. Tried lemongrass chicken, tastes rather insipid. I heard the pad thai was OK, but haven't gotten around to that yet. Their fried rice dishes are $10+, which is a bit high compared to what I'm used to.

Again, nothing special. Just you average chinese/Thai restaurant. One thing they do have going for them is fast service. Although food-wise, you can certainly do better."}
{"text":"Points for the language pun! The English nerd/major in me loves it. I love Thai food, and after coming back from California, I was disappointed that I couldn't find anything that looked good. Like any self-respecting foodie, I turned to yelp. 
High Thai'd was a great choice. Good service, reasonable prices ($9) quickly prepared and delivered and well served (my meal was pretty). Not quite five star worthy, but part of that is because they gave me beginners chop sticks, which ruined my delusions of Thai grandeur. :) 
Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the first thai restaurant i've tried in cleveland and i loved it. The service was quick and the server we had was very attentive and friendly. Me and my friends all ordered the country style pad thai, wanting a spicy dish but were disappointed because it wasn't spicy enough. next time we go, we will be asking for a \"very very spicy\" version of the dish. the appetizers came quick and were also very delicious. The location is very convenient and the only thing i would ask is for them to start making deliveries.

i will also be trying tree country soon to see how it compares."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, don't get me wrong. But it is really expensive for the among that they give.

If you do go, the beef basil and crazy noodles are pretty good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for thai food, and I feel that the food's been pretty fair for Thai food, albeit a bit on the expensive side.  I've had their curries, pad thai, and bites of a few other dishes, such as the salmon choo chee dish.  All have been alright, although I tend to prefer the curries here to their other dishes.  Admittedly, I'm not the best judge of Thai food in general, but the food seems good here, although it also hasn't blown me away (so 3 stars seems fair to me).  I have no complaints about the staff, who have always been nice, and the atmosphere seems appropriate for a Thai restaurant located in Coventry."}
{"text":"This place offers comforting thai cuisine.  I loved my panang curry with noodles.  Its not the best thai i have ever had but its good.  That being said I always want to use a spoon and eat the curry like soup.  Entrees are about 10-15$.   Theres street parking but also a nearby garage.  Dont forget to bring quarters."}
{"text":"NOT SHABBBYYYY!!!! I was very pleasantly surprised by this place.  I've heard some good and bad things but I had some time to try this place out.  I went with my go too- pad thai with extra peanuts and this dish had some flavor!!  My friend got the clear spring rolls and coconut soup- both were tasty.  The service was warm and welcoming and most of all FAST!!!!  The interior was quiet and a bit more old fashioned but hey I can't complain when the food comes out to you ASAP and your water gets filled up right away- something I can't way about other places in the area.  I would defintely go back here and try more of their dishes and maybe get two things to try!! The craziness, but in all seriousness- give this place a try, you might be pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"After having my first Thai food experience in Chicago, I would say that this was one sub-par. It was clean, open, and the food was like my rating A-OK, didn't wow me. I felt like the sweet and sour chicken was just the sweet part. I barely saw any chicken and it was all kinds of odd vegis, which was different, but I don't know about a good different. I see that they recently have started a sushi bar and I would consider going there for that if that had any type of specials. I think that they do good business, for lunch time on a week day, the were pretty busy. I overheard two other people dissatisfied with the amount of meat in their meals as well. I would say that they do have a plethora of options, which is good for Thai. However, for lunch, those prices were a tad high...I mean it's mostly vegis people, keep it around $5-8. Overall an average review, for an average place."}
{"text":"This review is based on take-out only, but I was a bit disappointed. When I got home, we had not been given the sauces that should have accompanied our appetizers. The curry was tasty, though nothing special. I suspect that High Thai'd is probably a pretty good restaurant, but our first experience was not impressive."}
{"text":"When we're craving that certain something. Meaning basil fried rice. You guys are our go to place, we've never had a bad experience. Your staff is extremely friendly, your restaurant is always clean and your food comes out quick and delicious. We normally get one to go. I would recommend some more comfortable seating, other than that. I wouldn't change a thing. We'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"High Thai'd makes me so sad, just because I was a huge fan of the Thai restaurant that was in this location several years ago. In the five or so times I've been here since its open, I don't think I've had a dish that's been without fault in some way, whether its overcooked seafood or bland noodle dishes or curry. I am on Coventry pretty frequently, so I have stopped in here several times, giving it chance after chance but I feel like its not worth coming here anymore. I'm just overall disappointed with this restaurant, and would definitely choose a different thai restaurant over this any day."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was mighty tasty!
The waitress was very nice, even though there was a slight language barrier. She happily explained the spice levels, and recommended I have the levels 1-3 spice. I ordered the Pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the High Thai'd Fried Rice (level 4 spiciness). I tasted his and WOOOhh, the waitress was right because it was too hot for me! My level 3 was perfect. :)
Not to say he didn't like his-- oh boy we both ate ALL of our food, no rice left behind.
The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and quaint. They have super cool decorations,  very near statues in the front as you walk in!

I'm gonna go back and try the pad see ew!"}
{"text":"Decided to grab dinner here with a friend after I lost power from the storm.  I got the Basil Chicken and she got the Pad Thai.  She said her Pad Thai was not bad, pretty standard.  I thought the Basil Chicken was alright, but kind of bland.  I've had more flavorful basil chicken.  I was also disappointed because it was not spicy AT ALL, even though I told them to give me a 4/5 in terms of spicy.  Will I be back? Probably not, I prefer Tree Country down the street. Although I am curious about the Avocado curry that people rave about."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! If you're in the Cleveland area, don't pass this restaurant up! As a lifelong lover of thai food, I have never come across better coconut soup. I also ordered the masaman curry with tofu which was fabulous. The waitress was also very friendly. This place is accommodating to vegetarians as well!"}
{"text":"We randomly happened into High Thai'd before heading to a show at The Grog. I'm a fan of Asian food of any style, and it seems like Coventry has no shortage of them lately. High Thai'd just happened to be the one we picked. 

The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. The food was delicious, as I find most Thai food to be. I can't say it was the best Thai I've ever had but it was definitely on par with some of my other favorite Thai places like Sweet Mango in Strongsville. What made them garner the 4th star was the OMG-I Might Inhale This-Supremely Delicious Thai Iced Coffee Boba (\"bubble tea\"). The pearls were perfectly cooked; absolutely perfect. I've had a great deal of overcooked pearls lately and this was heaven."}
{"text":"This was our second trip here. First visit was tasty and standard, though the most recent trip was less than impressive. There was only one server on a busy Saturday night, so it took quite a long time to place our order and then get our food (we were at the table for like an hour before our food arrived). We were with a big group and the food itself was varied; my pad Thai was all right, i know it's a standard dish but that means I tend to have it whenever i go and i wouldn't put this one at the top of my list. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"American Thai at it's finest.  I enjoy this place, and eat there frequently.  I find the food is of good quality, ample portions and excellent service.  I have never had anything off the menu that is not excellent.  I do think that their spice scale is a little on the weak side, but obviously they are doing this to cater to americans.  I have been successful in asking the waitress or waiter to make it very very hot - and they are able to really pack a punch.  I find the food to be very flavorful overall, and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that nobody has given this restaurant the review that it really deserves.

There used to be a restaurant here called Mint Cafe.  Mint Cafe served better Thai food than that place on Lee, better than the Map of Thailand in Chinatown, and far better than its neighbor Tree Country.   I thought the food was even better than some of the places I've been in Boston and NYC.  I was a regular, and carried out every other week.  I always got the Tamarind Duck and the Golden Bags.  My girlfriend always either got the Pad Thai or the Mint Cafe Fried Rice.

Then, Mint cafe closed down and was replaced by High Thai'd.  At first, it seemed exactly the same as Mint Cafe. The decor was similar, some of the staff was the same, the menu was the same (except for a few places where \"Mint Cafe\" was replaced with \"High Thai'd\" - i.e., \"High Thai'd\" fried rice, etc).  But then I tried the food.  Here is what happened to my favorite dishes:
- The Golden Bags are little fried meat/vegetable dumplings with scallion twist ties.  The first thing I noticed was that they seemed larger than before.  That would be good, except I also realized that they had changed the filling to a largely vegetable filling (to save money?).  They were also sloppily made and oily and left a bad taste in my mouth.
- The Tamarind Duck had different vegetables from before (more carrots, peppers) and was completely covered in ginger, which overwhelmed the dish and made it taste pretty awful.
- The Pad Thai was quite mushy 
- The High Thai'd fried rice was okay.  

The service is still quite good, like before.  But we no longer order here because, unfortunately, the food has clearly gone downhill.  For Thai food, we drive half an hour to Pepper Pike, to a restaurant called Peppermint.  It's the sister restaurant of Mint Cafe."}
{"text":"They have pad see ew! Be still, my heart!

My favorite Thai noodle dish, a heap of long, flat noodles stir fried with broccoli, carrots and a protein with a lovely brown sauce, is here. I've only found one other Thai place that serves it in the Cleveland area so far, so I'm immediately in love. This pad see ew featured shrimp and chicken, though next time I'll be requesting they replace that with tofu (even better!). Very good, and I still had half my plate to take home for leftovers.

The restaurant was clean, everyone was served promptly, and the prices were decent. My table enjoyed the panang curry or pad thai. But that doesn't matter--they have pad see ew!"}
{"text":"The first time that I got the crazy noodle to go it was a little dry, but this time I asked them to add a little extra sauce and it was perfect . The summer rolls were just ok. Could be done without the basil leaf, but that is just personal preference. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, I really enjoyed my fried rice, but customer service what give this place four stars in my opinion. We showed up close to their 3 o'clock closing (not on purpose)  however our server was very pleasant about it. He was very attentive our food came out quickly, he checked on us continuously and our glasses were never empty. It was great. I will definitely be back for the fried rice and the service."}
{"text":"We were in the Coventry neighborhood for a birthday party a few weekends ago, and since I don't cook on weekends, we ventured to this place. First, great service! Second, the food was INCREDIBLE!! Third, the drinks were fun & fruity. I was so impressed & found myself wishing this place had a west side location!! Stop in if you love Thai eats"}
{"text":"This place had some pretty tasty thai food.  Philly was lacking in Thai restaurants so it's nice to be in a city with a bunch of thai options.  I got the pad thai (boring I know but it's usually a good barometer of whether or not the place has good thai food, same goes for pizza places and ordering just the plain cheese).  I also got the veggie soup very tasty and I was overall impressed by the veggie selection in the menu.

Basically, I would totally come here again and get some kind of curry this time."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic (and most delicious) Thai food in Cleveland. The service is pretty good, most menu items can be made vegetarian. All of the curries (especially the yellow and avocado curries) are hearty. You can substitute brown rice. I felt that the food was beautifully arranged as it was served with carrot flowers and slices of lime."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, I'm totally used to a Thai place having a 1 page menu like the restaurants in NYC. Here at High Thai'd they have an extensive menu that is 5 pages.  There were so many selections.  It took longer to figure out what to order than to get our food.  

The service was good and the waitress was very attentive.  I tried the mango curry, the chicken dumplings, the tempura and the pineapple fried rice.  All were pretty good, especially the mango curry. 

No complaints here as far as the food in concerned. There was plenty of food and I had leftovers to take home.   The food was just as good the next day.

My only complaint is that they could kick up the music a bit.  It was eerily quiet and we could hear the conversation at other tables."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I have eaten to date. Great service. The windows in the front face cute wrought-iron people shaped sculptures.  No food pics because I wasn't convinced at first, but after tasting it, wowwwww."}
{"text":"We had never noticed this place tucked into a storefront on Coventry, until we tried to get lunch one day at Tommy's and it was closed.  Too hungry and tired to scope out alternatives, we asked the cashier at Mac's Backs for a recommendation, and he sent us here.

Great selection of vegetarian options (any Thai restaurant ought to meet this criteria) and both curries we ordered were quite tasty.  Biggest complaint was that I asked for \"level 10\" hotness, and the curry was, by my lights, only mildly spiced.  The place was completely empty around lunchtime on a Monday, and the service was (as a result?) very attentive.  The price was a little high for lunchtime, but we enjoyed our meal and would go back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delectable. I remember first coming to this place when it was first Mint Cafe and when they went under new management I was thinking that I was gonna be disappointed when they reopened. I was wrong. 

Everything is marvelous from the urban atmosphere to the food to the newly added sushi menu. Their service is fairly fast and they check on you frequently to make sure everything is to your liking. 

In regards to the food I have tried many things on the menu. The best appetizer is the seafood coconut soup and the best entree is kind of cliche but they have pretty good pad Thai. Instead of having to choose one meat or another they include the shrimp and chicken under the same price. The sushi may not seem authentic because it is in a Thai restaurant but don't let it fool you. It's absolutely delicious! 

Not the best Thai place I've been to but definitely worth trying out if you're a first time goer."}
{"text":"I dined here accidentally, wandering in only after my first choice for dinner was unexpectedly closed for vacation. So. Very. Glad. I. Did.

-spinach dumplings:  tender, perfectly steamed, filled with spiced veggies and served with ginger sauce
-seaweed salad:  amazing flavors, just the right amount of briny goodness, tempered with red pepper and sesame oil. The iceburg lettuce bed didn't add anything though, I would have preferred more seaweed
-tofu and vegetable pad thai:  initially concerned about the slightly colorless noodles, but thankfully the flavor was spot on. Good, solid pad thai

With so many vegetarian options, there's definitely room for a second (or third, or fourth) visit."}
{"text":"Very happy with our experience 
A large group (12) with various tastes. Everybody got something they liked. 
Beer selection was great. Lots of local flavor
Service was outstanding.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I have only ever had the Indonesian Fried Rice and it is great. Had been here with friends and they've enjoyed the dishes they've ordered, can't remember which specific ones though. Large portions, good value."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and I'm always looking for the best pad thai I'm northeast Ohio. I think this is tied for first place. I love that it's just slightly sweet, spicy (go for level 4 if you like spice, but not too much), and has plenty of peanuts. I scarfed down almost the whole large portion. We also had some summer rolls for appetizers (not my favorite of all time, but still fresh and good). The service was good, and the waitress was super helpful with my sister, who wasn't sure how to order because she is picky. Love this place. I'd be here all the time if it was closer."}
{"text":"OMG THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THAI FOOD PLACES IN CLEVELAND!!!

Their thai noodles are just SO flavorful that I just keep going back there again and again! I particularly like their crazy noodle, regular pad thai, and their fried chicken wings in the appetizer section. The waiters are very friendly and they don't come bother you too much, which I appreciated. OH BTW DID I MENTION THAT THEY HAVE A SUSHI BAR? AND DID I MENTION THAT 12 pieces shashimi is only 12 dollars ish (i don't rmb the exact amount and pieces but it's super cheap comparing to other places in cleveland). Although their cut might not be as good as pacific east next door. but anyways, I would definitely keep going there!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  The service is great and they are really great about personalizing (is that a word?) your order.  They will leave off onions or make it super spicy or leave out  the spice and I really appreciate that.  They actually have a few pretty tasty martinis and cocktails, as well.  

We've never encountered a long wait and the staff is always very friendly.  Definitely recommend the Crazy Noodles and Basil Fried Rice."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on Coventry! And super friendly staff. My favorite dish is the tofu string beans. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I disagree with the other reviewer. High Thai'd is an awesome name. It could be interpreted on various levels. I think the best level would be to go there high, and eat Thai. That is the best advice I can offer you. I get the green curry most of the time, but all items off the menu are satisfying."}
{"text":"Ok but nothing special. My wife and i ordered 2 separate and different dishes and they were exactly the same. Too much sugar in the crazy noodles, the tom yum and the tom gar soup and my tom yum had 2 whole shrimp in it. (They never asked me if i wanted chicken or shrimp)

Probably won't go back. Unfortunately tree country bistro is equally mediocre as is pacific east and hunan coventry so the moral of the story is that if tpu want good asian goto chinatown and siam cafe, boolong or li wah"}
{"text":"3.5 that I'll round to 4*

We went late at night on a weekday, arrived 45 mins before closing.  Some restaurants would have turned us away given nobody else was there.  But they sat us and were super courteous all night.. no rushing.. no pressure.

We got the deviled wings for appetizer.  The name made me think it was going to be spicy, which it wasn't. But it was super fresh and crispy, well seasoned, and one of the best chicken wing appetizers I've had in a while.

I got the crazy noodles, which were pretty good.  Nothing wrong with them, but nothing spectacular.  Broad noodles, with some chicken, shrimp, and veggies.  He got the Conventry Road Madness: shrimp, mussels, squid, with veggies in a deliciously spicy sauce.  Ever since our trip to Thailand last year, we keep saying that Thai food in the States is a whole different beast from that in Thailand.  But this place comes prety close...  I also got the green tea boba smoothie, and he got the thai iced tea -- both were yummy.

It's a easy location for us, and the food isn't anything to blow your mind -- but it's good.  We'll be back for more.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and authentic thai food. I'd suggest the crazy noodle. Cozy and calm atmosphere inside. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and never when it was Mint Cafe (you'll usually find me at Pac East when in Coventry).  I ordered a Pad See Ew with Chicken (which is the true national dish of Thailand, not the better-known Pad Thai), as I do on every first visit to a new Thai restaurant. I'd say the dish was disappointing, except months have passed since I visited, and nothing about my meal stands out in my tasting memory.  I do remember being completely flummoxed that my dining companion proclaimed this as his favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  But what are you going to do? He's a white guy.  (Sorry, white guys!)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with some friends! Their Thai tea is a little bit too sweet for my taste, but I had a wonderful waiter that really appealed to any allergies at my table. He was also prompt with refilling my water glass and suggested any particularly unique dishes. I recommend their curries, it's a hidden gem, and their Thai salads! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
