{"text":"Yes! A fresh, hot piccadilly pizza reminds me of how Chuck e cheeses pizza used to taste in the past (once was my favorite fast food pizza but now terrible)! But the dough needs to be cooked more...I found myself throwing away most of the dough (though I liked the taste).  It's great to get a blast from the past! I would only eat here though if the pizza looks like it just came out of the oven...because these need to be eaten HOT!   Minus one because it's super expensive at $3.50 for a small slice...but hey, it is a tourist area. It doesn't make it right but it makes it understandable. It just means I won't frequent it unless I have a craving."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst pizza I've had in Vegas. Even if I was to ignore the flavorless sauce and the doughy crust, I just can't recommend you eat at a pizzeria that uses such terrible cheese. It had the flavor of nacho cheese from a dollar theatre. There are quite a few better places on Fremont st. so by all means eat at those.  I can't even recommend that you eat here if you're drunk."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want some pizza and a cup of water. They charge you for A CUP of water. I couldn't believe how rude their staff was. I had to have my male friend ask for napkins because the women didn't even acknowledge me. Most sexist place I've ever visited. I don't even know why I keep visiting the most worst places on Yelp. Do not EVER VISIT THIS PLACE. Unless you speak Spanish, the associates only tended to the people who spoke Spanish. Unless you were a man, then the helped you. I will be spreading the word on not to come here. I would not even give 1 star."}
{"text":"Sadly, I've eaten here a few times.  This place is only good for one reason...the late night, I'm super wasted and need something to stuff my face with.  The price and size of their pizza is reasonable, but the quality is nonexistent.  I would never eat here when I'm sober.  This place receives 2 stars merely for its convenience.  Located in the heat of the Fremont Street Experience, this place gets it's business from the people stumbling in that see a pizza sign."}
{"text":"Everything is good!! All beef hot dogs, pizza deep dish and pan. Coffees & ice cream all the junk food u want when your drinking. Plus a great price. Went back a second time for the works hot dog so...good!!"}
{"text":"Prety good pizza...great dough!"}
{"text":"Inedible. Raw dough. Huge crowds. Rushed. There are better options out there. Ordered a large cheese pizza and was greatly disappointed"}
{"text":"Had cheese stick, wings, and pizza and all of it was good! The only reason why I wouldn't give it a 5 star is because of the cashier, she had a face like she didn't want to be there, should smile:)  And everyone complaining about the 3.99 pizza, you ain't forced to buy it, there's plenty of other food places"}
{"text":"I usually stop here whenever on Fremont St. Nothing great here but is fast, convenient n the food is ok. The seating area could use more rounds of cleanup. But this is the spot when I'm on Fremont n need a bite. Pizza by the slice joint, n a few other items on the menu. Simple, easy, n quick."}
{"text":"Definitely think it is a frozen pizza. Digornio tastes better than this. I don't care how much you've had to drink I would not buy ANY slices!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot! Perfect amount of sauce for a slice of pizza. I'd go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Just about 12 Noon on a Friday and it's just me and another gentleman in here. A typical pizza by the slice joint. $4 per slice. I'm the type of person if I don't tip I feel guilty but the only  thing the guy behind the counter says is $7.98 then here comes stiff city."}
{"text":"Feelin' buzzed off your football beer?  If it's not too late, dip in to the Picadilly Pizza on Fremont Street.  Grab a slice, or a slice and a coke combo for under 5 bucks.  It's cheap food and you don't care what it tastes like.  You're wasted.  Not so high ratings because they yell at you if you show up 2 minutes after closing time, you must pay in cash (at least that's what I remember) and it's in the middle of all those lame gift shops that attract all the tourists from places like Iowa."}
{"text":"A Chicago style greasy spoon on Fremont Street. Vienna Hot dogs, Maxwell street style Polish sausages. Pizza slices are not too bad. Its not the Ritz but it delivers the goods. Great staff always friendly."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Piccadilly Circus Pizza for a long time. Unfortunately, this location has nothing to do with the PC that I know. Terrible service, crappy pizza (not the same as other PC locations), and..... are you ready for this...a 50-cent surcharge for debit or credit cards. I will never eat here again.  Save your money and eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"As often as I stay on Fremont street, I'm surprised this was the first time I've eaten here... or not.  Some friends of mine were \"jonesing\" for pizza, so I lead them to this place on the recommendation of other friends that had eaten here before and claimed was good. First off, it's a \"pizza by the slice\" kind of place, but the selection was pretty skimpy, as were the slices.   The cheese pizza looked overcooked and dry, like it'd been sitting under the heat lamp all morning. Very unappetizing. I got a piece of Hawaiian. It was dry. I've had frozen pizza that taste better than this! My friends seemed to enjoy it, but they are also easy to please, so...  Next time I'm jonesing for some pizza, I'll walk a block up and go to Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible customer service. I don't care how busy you are, you do not let people cut in line and just apologize to everyone behind that they were pushy. It's your job to serve everyone in order. Not to mention they gave us a pizza 5 minutes after we ordered and it was burnt and dry. For $25 for a 15\" pepperoni pizza you can do better. Don't come here just because your walking the strip. There are many restaurants with caring staff."}
{"text":"This pizza place was alright . The wait was kinda long even though there wasn't a line.. that's all I can think of .."}
{"text":"Used to be good, been here a few times on previous Vegas visits however, this time we both got sick. Our friends went there the next day and they too got sick. Something not right."}
{"text":"Not bad for a snack (late night) price and size of pizza isn't bad. Most likely for me it's a \"one and done\" type place for me."}
{"text":"Cheap foot fast and hot   not much more to say about this place they advertise Vienna beef and have sporty peppers, so they try to make Chicago Dog, it was OK it filled the belly till I could figure out what I wanted to eat for a full meal  the BF had a couple pieces of Pizza it was soft and hot lots of cheese"}
{"text":"Crust is like a thin deep dish, but if you don't like your pizza with an extra helping of grease don't eat here. This place is for desperately hungry tourists."}
{"text":"If you know what's good for you save your money and don't eat here. It's overpriced it's stale and extremely greasy. There are a lot of other places on Fremont Street to choose from."}
{"text":"You pay at the counter then grab the pizza. The Pizza here is really good. My group of four got pizza but couldn't find seating. They need more seats inside. We had to go to the standing seat to eat our pizza. Overall the pizza is good and you should check it out."}
{"text":"Good hot food. The calzone took about 10 mins but came out  fresh and hot. Only complaint is the seating area was so blessed hot we took our food and left"}
{"text":"Crap.   Pure and utter crap.    I went here for lunch with my friends and wife and this is not good pizza.   I don't understand how a place can F up pizza but this place does.    Do yourself a favor and avoid it, go into a casino and get pizza it will be better then this.     The pizza was expensive $17 for a pie, and it was best described as \"bowling alley pizza\"."}
{"text":"Not much to report on this place because I only ordered a slice of pizza. It was fresh, hot with light sauce, fluffy crust and delicious veggies. $3.99 for a slice was decent"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick slice when you're out walking around on Fremont. I've been several times and only last time noticed that there is seating in the back of the store. Thank goodness because after walking all day it feels good to take a quick break. Good pizza, decent prices."}
{"text":"Keep on Walking! Everything is Better! Bad Food Bad Attitudes Bad Service just extend your game of Dodge the Hookers & Beggars and find Any Place else !"}
{"text":"This place is alright not great just average. Usually meant for drunk walkers walking by and getting a slice is alright but other than that theres way better piizza places around freemont better than this."}
{"text":"Worst place ever  Stay away for this food / people   Not clean wonder how the still open"}
{"text":"I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. Just don't keep your expectations high.  We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn't want to leave. We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. So, in that sense, it served its purpose.  We got the 5.99 \"special\" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like \"Michaelina\" type \"pizza\" you would buy in a grocery store. I mean..I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.  Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn't that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?  If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...  2 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best pizza I've EVER had. I never eat at the same place in Vegas, and I've eaten here every single day. I'm even taking a pie to go back to California. I will be back, and I'm telling my family."}
{"text":"The pizza was cold and maybe two days old and the Hot Dog was over priced. and then they charged to use a credit card. Do yourself a favor and keep looking. This pkace gives Freemont Street Dives a bad name. There's much better places to have a quick lunch around there that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Located on the old Vegas strip very cool place to visit if your in the area. It's small little pizza place but don't let the size fool you. The pizza is actually very good. Sitting off in a corner of the main strip this place will surprise you. Being established in such a well place is truly amazing. I ordered the meat lovers slice and my wife ordered the pepperoni and both were very good. It also has a small salad bar located in the inside of the business buts separated from the pizza place and apparently very good cause customers for both sides where in an out by loads.    The pizza is also cooked as ordered and doesn't just sit out under hot lamps it's cooked fresh and hot and ready to go. Not pricey at all especially for being located where it is. It's also by all kinds of cool attractions and things too do and a lot of things to see as you walk old Vegas strip. Highly recommended by myself."}
{"text":"There was a long line for pizza by the slice here so we took the bait. The pizza is one of the worst I ever had.  Pizza Rock sells pizza by the slice and is right down the street. It's excellent! Read the reviews and try them out."}
{"text":"One thing a hungry girl should never forget - if the restaurant is empty (it was lunch hour nonetheless) there is a reason!  I dined all alone at Piccadilly Freemont - and not because I'm a lonely thirty-something spinster!  Well, I guess I am a lonely thirty-something spinster - but that's not why I dined alone.  Trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.    This place is just awful.  I don't know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but I can assure you it's on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum.  I ordered the $5.99 special - 2 cheese slices and a 16 oz soda and it seemed like a bargain until I got my food.   I looked at those puffy, pitiful, slices of pizza  crusted over with a few shreds of cheese, and my heart sank.  Moments like these make me pause and wish I was more of an outspoken trouble maker.  I wish I had the nerve to thrust my chin forward and demand my money back.  However, since I am about as spineless as a gummy bear that's been sitting in the sun for an hour, I took my sad little lunch and ate all whilst plotting my yelp revenge.    They couldn't even get my diet coke right.  The 16 oz cup was filled to the brim with ice and perhaps 3 sips of soda.  How very disappointing.  I expected better Freemont street!  Well, not really.  I guess I should have known I was strolling down the boulevard of tourist traps.  I'm ashamed that, as a local Las Vegan, I didn't have the sense to keep on strolling.  Do yourself a favor folks, skip this joint.  It's a waste of calories!"}
{"text":"Simple shop on Fremont street. The pizza is good, but nothing to rave about. You have evel pie and other shops for more to choose from. This is perfect tourist food lol. Me as a local I pass here from time to time and grab a slice. Very odd because I was over charged twice there. They fixed it but still a little weird.  The staff is mostly broken English. Still usually very friendly. I have no problem coming back here from time to time because the prices are good and the pizza doesn't take long. If I was looking for a more intimate place I obviously wouldn't choose here. However for fair prices and good pizza it's perfect for tourists!!"}
{"text":"Yeah its not the greatest but you know what you're buying before you buy it. Its right there in front of you. The pizza was decent, it seemed clean to me, and the service was very efficient and friendly.  It wasnt as bad as I thought it would be and the prices aren't cutthroat."}
{"text":"It's the best pizza....if you're drunk on Fremont street and need food. Quite pricey at 3.99 for a slice of cheese pizza and there is a .50 charge when using credit cards."}
{"text":"Jayzis, this place.  What a waster. Found myself pleasantly buzzed on Fremont Street, watching its famous light show above when a hunger came on. Approached a few police officers and asked if there was a place to get a decent slice in the area. They said sure, Piccadilly's down the block. Now I don't know if this is the ONLY place to get a slice in the area or if they actually think it's good...(or perhaps, they just like to mess with tourists). Walked up to the counter, saw they had a display case full of pies with slices ready to go and behind said case were a couple of ovens.  So what did I expect? Not unlike every other pizza joint that's set up the same way, I expected to order the slice, they throw it in the oven for a few minutes to heat and crisp it up, I eat the slice. Didn't quite go that way. Instead, I ordered the slice, they took it out of the display case, put it on a paper plate, and handed it to me. This sorry, luke-warm, excuse barely retained the properties to accurately be called pizza. It was a decently sized slice, I'll give'em that.  It was when I folded it in half to make a bite more manageable that I realized just how shite it was.  This thing coulda been rolled up into a cannoli it was so flimsy. I wager I could have went to Walgreens, purchased a frozen Tony's pizza, slapped that sucker on Las Vegas Blvd for a few hours and let the sun bake it and it would have been a better option. Even drunk, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this restaurant the pizza was cold and no good and they will not let us use the restroom I think the people working there whereSpanish with no papers"}
{"text":"Its probably frozen but its quintessential after-bar pizza when you have been stumbling around downtown/fremont for 6 hours.  It does the trick, but nothing amazing. Nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you love soggy pizza,  dining with cock-a-roaches,  and being overcharged.   It's mostly my own fault, trying to find food on X-Mas eve, even in Vegas was difficult."}
{"text":"It was late, and I was starving. Was on Fremont and was desperately looking for a food joint. Came across Piccadilly and decided to try it. Got their large with half pepperoni. Spent over $20 for it! No where near worth it. Not even worth half that amount. First mistake: they cook it in a pan. Unless u have the right dough for this, which they don't, it won't cook right. Second mistake: u need the right oven to cook such a pizza, which they don't. Their sauce was ok. Not rubbery plastic taste that most pizza shops in Vegas have. Pepperoni did cook well, but pizza dough was not nearly cooked enough and had no flavor. Service was ok, considering how busy it was. If your on Fremont and there is absolutely nothing else to eat, then give it a shot. But don't expect much."}
{"text":"OK. This place is for when you are drinking and walking up and down Fremont... THAT'S it. The whole pizzas are a bit expensive and I think it's around $3 for a slice so I can understand why people would expect more from this place but it's Vegas... you're paying for the location and once again... It's Vegas. We had a slice at about 11pm one night and about 1:20am the next night.. both nights, drunk and the pizza tasted greasy and delicious."}
{"text":"Took a little long to get our pizza. However  was worth the wait.  Italian style pizza hot and fresh. I was a bit faded but the pizza was grand. It help cushion the morning hangover while indulging in hot cheesy slice of heavan before ubering a ride to my room for a good night sleep. I will definitely make a stop here again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for what you get (over $3 for a slice) but it was very tasty and it's hard to resist the smell from outside! I'd splurge on a whole pizza next time for the money spent per slice."}
{"text":"One of the biggest tourist traps around. Skip this overpriced crap and look for McDonald's in that one casino for cheap food, or a sit-down restaurant for a better value. $5.99 is apparently a \"special\" price for two average (at best) slices of cheese pizza and a pretty small soda, and the rest of the menu is definitely overpriced. Only reason this gets two stars is that the food and service weren't actually horrible."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend from this pizza place 3 times this past weekend being in Vegas.   The first night we ordered a large pepperoni pizza to go when we got to our room we devoured it. Yes we have been drinking and we were hungry but it just seemed like it was really good. So the next day when we went to downtown in the afternoon we stopped and had just a slice of pizza. We were sober and again this pizza was just amazing for us. My slice seemed a little greasy this time around but it was still good. So again on the next night after walking downtown we stopped again at 1 in the morning and ordered a whole pizza to go when we got to our room we were just as satisfied.  It may not be the best pizza I've ever had but it is definitely in my top 3. I would definitely go back again even if it is three times in one weekend lol. Oh and by the way customer service was whatever but it didn't bother me. It's not like they were rude or anything all they did was took my order so it was just a casual simple transaction."}
{"text":"With the amount of business this place does and the location, the food should be better. It's decent late night food but you have better options just east of this place.  Uncle joes pizza just down the street for one is a better option."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Piccadilly pizza. As drunk as I tend to get on Fremont, this place is a welcome haven for us idiots. It's remarkably clean. For the amount of business it does. The pizza is hot and ready fast. The employees are courteous.  The historic casino photos make for something interesting to look at while you regain your senses."}
{"text":"We came to enjoy the night at freemont experience and tried this place out  It was really good pizza the only reason im not giving them atleast 4 stars is becuase we were attended by 2 diffrent people and they were both extremly rude to both my husband and i"}
{"text":"Even half in the bag this was not great pizza.  Average pizza is sooooo easy to make, why couldn't they pull it off."}
{"text":"This place is designed for the super drunk masses taking part in the Fremont Street Experience. If you aren't super drunk, which we weren't, you're going to regret paying the 50 cent fee to use a credit card. I mean, who does that? Joints that cater to captive, stumbling, money-is-no-object audience do, I guess.  Take one of the other reviewer's advice and hit up the McDonald's down the street."}
{"text":"oh my god, what a shitty piece of pizza. this is a tourist trap. shitty floppy bland pizza smothered in grease, charged me 50 cents to use my credit card? we only stumbled in here cause we were buzzed and uncle Joe's pizza was already closed down the street (we heard it was awesome). this place is cheap to say the least, and the pizza was extremely crummy, bleh!"}
{"text":"We were down in fremont street and wanted a quick slice of pizza, so we walked by this place and  decided to order.  The pizza seems to be pretty much cooked and once you order they pop it back in the oven.  Not my favorite pizza but it wasnt bad. The location inside it pretty cute, they have playing cards, a post card, room key and a chip from each of the casinos hanging on the walls. All the employees were pretty freindly."}
{"text":"They are quick, patient and the best late night snack! Slices are huge! So yummy, our favorite!"}
{"text":"They make pizza to go, but it seems like people mostly go there after a night of partying. I ordered a pizza to take up to my hotel room at the D and we enjoyed it. Don't eat it after it cools down though!"}
{"text":"An easy stop when you want a quick snack while traversing Fremont street. They are open late so it's a good post-drinking stop. The pizza is good for a fast food style place."}
{"text":"Not good pizza. The slice of pepperoni I got didn't taste like anything. I ordered it to go and placed paper towels above and below it when I saw all the pooled grease. When I got back to my room, the paper towels were drenched in grease. I sprinkled the Parmesan cheese they gave me. It was brown and probably expired. I'm hungry and I love pizza so I took a bite. Nothing. No flavor. It was weird.  I didn't take a second bite and ate a nutrigrain bar I had in my suitcase, instead. On the bright side, it was cheap so I only wasted $4."}
{"text":"The other reviewers got it right - the pizza is greasy, very below average, but satisfies drunk cravings I guess.  What frustrates me is that the price doesn't reflect how shitty the food is! I paid about $21.50 for a 15 inch pie that my girlfriend and I shared. Slices are over $3. I'm from NY and you could get wayyyyy better pizza for that price."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. Drier than a desert. Lousy service and rip off prices. Stay away if you're smart. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Cheap pizza after a long night of gambling on Fremont street!  It isn't super gourmet, but hits the spot for that late night pizza craving."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday weekend was craving pizza so saw this spot and stopped by.  Overall it was really good. I think I paid around 5 bucks for a slice.  Be back soon maybe. Thanks"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes like something you microwave. The combo comes with a small cup. If other pizza places are open id avoid this one."}
{"text":"MMMM - a yard of something sugary sweet and full of alcohol, plus 4 beers plus some vodka and juice, add about an hour on the slots trying to win that damn Corvette from the 4 Queens!!  I am feeling really buzzed n hungry.  The original Hungry One and I stumble into Piccadilly.  OMG I am telling you now,  the greasy cheesy Gods must make the pizza themselves!!!  Drunk food heaven right here on Fremont in Downtown Las Vegas.  You would be a fool to try this sober!!!"}
{"text":"Affordable pizza slices, friendly staff, and opens late -- okay. I supposed there are many places that opens late. This place is worth checking out if you love pizza crust like I do. It's been talked about by my visiting friends and locals a few times.   There may not be enough seating in the back, so we stood by the counter there and made new friends. If you happen to be there, I would recommend you to do the same."}
{"text":"Every downtown has to have a late night pizza joint where you can grab a quick slice and drink and sit or keep walking.  Although not the best pizza in town, even downtown, you cannot beat the convenience, price and service at Picadilly.  It has other greasy spoon delights deep fried and munchie-friendly.  Watch out for bums, freaks and tourists doing their thing next to Hollywood Blvd. Wanna-bees."}
{"text":"Zero stars... How is there no re-fill for a large but there is for small and medium!! That's a ridiculous  rule. Never coming back!!"}
{"text":"Seems like other people didn't have a good experience here, that's too bad because every time I eat here it's great. I'm usually with a group of people so we order a whole pizza (then it's made fresh). I'm always happy with the taste and cook of it. If I get a slice I ask first when the next pizza is coming out. There is a sitting area in the back, nothing fancy but who cares. All the walking on Fremont it's nice to sit and chill for a moment. Besides you see worse things on Fremont then a dining area in a pizza spot. Cough cough naked old men begging for money. Lol! Give it a try, make sure you get it fresh, and you be the judge."}
{"text":"This is the spot that takes care of my drunk hunger! I am a downtown girl and this is usually the snack stop for a slice. The pizza is average, not great but not horrible. It will satisfy that urge for a fast food fill up after trolling the Fremont Experience strip.   The cleanliness could be better, they could use an interior upgrade. The place looks so old that it is impossible to get that fresh clean feel and look. The small dining area they have needs improvement. The tables and chairs have seen better days. The old 80's chair I sat in had ripped vinyl."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people hate this place so much! It's just like a boardwalk 'we have everything' hole in the wall. You know what you're getting when you come here!  Seriously! They have whatever you might be craving...churros? Sure! Snow Cones? Like...real snow cones and not chunky ice cones? YEP! Greasy pizza? Corn dogs? Smoothies? Ice Cream? Yep, yep and more yep.   I say stop in, chow and be on your way!"}
{"text":"Its a cheap pizza by the slice type place. You can \"dine\" in or out but they dont have a restroom and sent me across the street. (Can you even serve food in a dinning area and not have a restroom?)  I wasnt distracted by the flashing lights of the casino and made it back over to buy a slice. I normally love pizza by the slice places as they are quick and easy to carry as you go to your next stop.  This pizza fit those categories but it was made with low quality meat and cheese. Was kinda bummed out with it.   The next time I'm on Fremont st I will definitely find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I spent $3 a slice on pizza that was a slice from a small Domino's pie, what a bummer.  On the strip i could accept that, but on Fremont st?  Get that shit out of my face.  I only realized this non-sense after my buddy paid.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"So I'm not a huge fan of Piccadilly but I think I keep ending up here because it's quick and convenient. I've ended a few of my nights downtown with a trip to Piccadilly which is located at the end of the Fremont Street Experience. They serve pizza, hot dogs, churros and a few other things. It's not too bad of a place to sober up at because they don't serve alcohol. The pizza's alright and I guess it tastes good if you're liquored up and need to eat but basically, their pizza quality is comprable to the standard carnival or fair pizza.  There's a seating area in the back and the tables are sticky and gross but when you're intoxicated, it doesn't seem like such a big deal. Customer service is ok and I don't plan on going back but if I somehow end up there under the influence again, I probably won't complain."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever.... I was craving some pizza and since my regular pizza joint down the street was closed... I decided to try this one out... big big mistake.  Their bait there is... 2 cheese slices and a small ( kids) drink for $ 5.99 I opted for to pay extra for one pepperoni slice and ended up paying 9 bucks....  The pizza was a big soggy doughy mess with almost no cheese or toppings.  It was about  80% dough, 10% sauce, 5% cheese and about 3 slices of pepperoni. I could barley choke it down. Ended up throwing most of it away. For having \"pizza\" in their name and that being the selling point of the place... I was very disappointed..  Never again  The restaurant was not very attractive ... mirrors were dirty, tables hadn't been cleaned, trash cans were full and dirty, and the counters along the wall were also dirty."}
{"text":"Spent some time the other evening at the Fremont Experience in Vegas and suddenly the wafting from below the neon signs called me into Picadilly Pizza. Near the Walgreen's, it's right next to a Liquor store. Grabbed a slice for $5 (it's Vegas after all), piping hot, pepperoni, a few pieces of paper towel (not to mention a few beers from next door) and back onto the road. Great pie and a great late night dinner for everyone."}
