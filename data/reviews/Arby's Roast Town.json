{"text":"It's always dead at this location for some reason. I never ever see anyone here when I drive by. They got rid of one of the soda machines in here for some reason and the staff is beyond minimal. Very rare I come to this Arby's but I really wanted a Beef N' Cheddar lol"}
{"text":"Hey... It's Arby's... It's fast food... Enough said really. 
But this location is very spacious and it's always been clean when I've been by. And heck who can resist the curly fries!
The staff have always been good and prompt. My food has been hot and fresh (again, it's fast food so fresh-ish lol). 

What can I say - when you need you're roast beef and curly fries fix, this Arby's will do in a pinch"}
{"text":"I ordered their new SEASONED ROAST BEEF THREE CHEESE & BACON sandwich and was totally unimpressed. The sandwich looked no where near the picture and was squished flat with a stale bun. No wonder they are closing stores!"}
{"text":"There isn't an Arby's in Markham. I'm good with travelling to Ajax to visit this location. I shop at the box stores across the street now and again, so this restaurant is convenient for me to drop by. 

Staff there are always polite. I love the medium sandwich with curly fries. Today, I went with the bacon roast beef. It was pretty good, but I love my usual more! Perhaps it's the fake cheese that doesn't do much for me. 

The restaurant is spacious and clean. I'm glad that Arby's is still alive and kicking."}
