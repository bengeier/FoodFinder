{"text":"I  just  love  angela  pizza .  Has a delicious  pizza sauce. The only drawback  is that my favorite  topping  is pepperoni ,  but their pepperoni   too salty. I normally  don't  like  italian  sausage, but  angela mia has the best  I  have ever tasted ."}
{"text":"Yep, just as good as the Euclid location.  Please make sure you call the correct location when you place your order!!!  Just like I wrote in my previous review....tastes similar to Tasty Pizza but way, way better.  Great sauce...probably my fave sauce in Cleveland.  Why not 5 stars?  Because they seriously need to split lines for, \"Place an Order\" and, \"Pick Up an Order.\"  When it gets buzy, the waiting area is jammed and people are waiting in the same line to do both things.  Complete cluster."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pizza. I see the Tasty Pizza reference. They don't skimp on the toppings or cheese. Wish it had a bit more sauce thou, because it was pretty good!!! We warmed up our leftovers the next day on a pizza stone. It was fabulous, like it woke it up!! Maybe ask for it well done next time. Pretty crowded on a Saturday early evening in the pickup order area, but that just means people like it."}
{"text":"Being from New York, my pizza standards are rather high. The pizza here isn't bad at all. The service sucks. Don't call for take out!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO STARS, I would. I ordered 20 wings, and when I brought them home, they were so fatty and slimy, they were inedible. I called and inquired about the return policy, only to get a rather unpleasant reply from the staff that there would be no cash refund, only the option that they would remake the order. Why would I want you to remake the order when it should have been cooked correctly the first time? High fat wings equates to low quality chicken. I've had better wings at PIZZA HUT. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Angela Mia my entire life . Love, love, love everything about this location! The pizza and service are always great. I love cheese but lately there has been too much, even on a regular pizza. Please scale back on the cheese."}
{"text":"Growing up in East Cleveland we lived off this pizza place. I haven't eaten Angela-Mia in over 25 years. Hey I live in Philly home of the thin sliced pizza. I recently came to visit my in the Cleveland area saw this place and said why not. It was so good it made forget about those skinny thin crust pizzas back east. I got a deluxe pie with everything but the anchovies.  It was delicious and filling. This is a definite must for out of towners. Cant wait to stop by again"}
{"text":"Such a great pizza!  The cheese is real!!!  My favorite is extra cheese and a veg.. Just say yes and get your order on!"}
{"text":"Got a pizza from the new location yesterday and it was good. Same Angela Mia taste! Greasy but yummy. It's a Cleveland classic!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love the buttery flavored crust, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and its not greasy!. The ingredients are fresh and tasty, and just the right balance of everything.  I bought a pizza and brought it back to DC with me. Nothing like Angela Mia Pizza in this area...can't wait to bring back another one...or two!!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to find good pizza in this area...we found it!  I have had different pizza in Little Italy and this is better.  The price is also reasonable.  I like the fact that the toppings are under the cheese and the cheese is whole milk.   One word of caution.  Don't do a half and half pizza.  You will have a hard time determining which side has your toppings."}
{"text":"I am very upset with how Nikki and Angela Mia handled me. I purchased a pizza, lasagna and wings about a month ago or less. I got back to work and my lasagna was frozen on the inside. I called and spoke with the Manager (Joe)who advised my next lasagna was free. He pretended to take down my information and we agreed. I just called today and was told by Nikki that Joe told her he never said that and there is nothing they would do for me. I have been a faithful customer for more than 30 years and this is the treatment I get. Turns out I'm not such a valued customer after all. Not only did you loose me, you lost my co-workers who are upset for me, as well as my out-of-town guests who love AM. I suppose all things must come to an end."}
