{"text":"You know, I always thought bartenders were supposed to be welcoming and friendly. No? The one we had brought us beer but then completely ignored us for the next half hour, serving other people but breezing by us and the profane gentlemen to our left at the bar.  Finally, another bartender came over to bring another beer. When we asked for our tab, suddenly our original bartender regained her hearing and piped up, \"THEY HAVE RUNNING TAB ALREADY!\" Aha, magic! When it comes time to settle our bill, suddenly we exist!  Kind of a boring place, too, but they have Great Lakes beer on tap and it was delicious.  It's right next to the ballpark, so it's slammed before home games. Obviously."}
{"text":"Great feel in the bar. Drinks were good. Games on all tv's. Restrooms very clean and all around great bar. Ask for Mark the owner and also hit up before Browns games."}
{"text":"Welcome, is exactly how i feel when i walked into this establishment.  I've been here twice with my wife and and my wife and a few friends another time.  Not a fluke.  Both times i instantly felt at home and at ease.  Some places make you guess at how they do things, not here.  Here it is the common practice, drink, food, order and you receive it.  Staff is all friendly, ownership takes an honest approach, and an interest in your thoughts and comments.  I urge you, if you have a real problem, to talk to the owner, with calm discussion, i'm sure they will do what they can for you.  (If your in there and it's wall to wall because it's an Indians game, be patient, it is a small establishment, they can only serve so many)  (be realistic, you don't get service at a stadium setting the same way you would on a dead Tuesday evening).    The atmosphere is casual, as when last in here we were amongst  a group of friends, cops, a few people just getting a bite to eat and take in a game at the bar, and an entire wedding party/family.  It's comfortable, open, and dark.  (for me that's a great thing, it's dark in a classy way)  (too many places like to light up the world, and that's just not relaxing after having to deal with day to day problems that life can throw at you...when you want to get away and just have fun, this is a place that works great. )  Even when it got busier, you could easily handle conversation without yelling or straining to hear, as it takes mass of sound well.  Making it a great place to meet friends for skillfully made drinks, by efficient, friendly but not overbearing bartenders.  (Including on tap rootbeer).  Food is prepared with fresh ingredients.   This does not mean food is (here's your piece of meat, with some veggies steamed on it).  Not by a long shot.  You can tell that the owners, and their head chef share a passion for food.  Layers of flavor are common.  Not stacked upon one another, but readied for your enjoyment through different mastered techniques of the culinary arts.   The food is a step above what you would expect ...if not many steps above, of the establishment it is in.  We joked with the owner that we would love to franchise him.  Once the word gets out about the food there will be no stopping them.  (this is a place that you could take in a game, or head to the other room and have a wonderful dinning experience for a special event of some sort (come on guys, you know you hate the stuffiness of a french waiter,,but at the same time you feel your wives deserve that \"special feeling\" on a fork for those birthdays and anniversaries.  Goodfeller's can please both of your wants.    Bathrooms are clean and not cramped.  As is the layout of the restaurant.    Prices are reasonable, particularly considering the quality of food you are receiving.  200 miles, and not a complaint in the decision to drive there.  Go for the food, enjoy the drink, Leave thinking you'll be back.  I know we will.     Thank You to all of the Goodfeller's staff we have encountered on out outings.  T&E"}
{"text":"While on a road trip from Buffalo for the Bills-Browns game, our friend suggested this place.  He had been here before an Indians game and said the food was delicious (he's Italian---I instinctively trust his judgement).  Once we got into town and saw there was no grilling allowed in Browns lots, we knew we had to find some quality food.  So, we caught a cab and ended up here at around 9:30 on a Saturday night.  Even in our Bills gear, we were nicely greeted by locals and the Bartender.  I was impressed by the amount of taps, and my husband even found a new favorite beer (Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale--too bad it's not distributed in Buffalo!).  The Bartender, Dave, was grinding mint for mojitos and mixing fresh Moscow Mules: I was impressed.  The food was outstanding: ingredients were clearly fresh, and dishes were freshly prepared.  My hubby and I split a poblano pepper appetizer, filled with goat cheese and andouille sausage, and surrounded by a fresh roma tomato and cilantro salsa brava:  If we weren't in public, I would have licked the bowl.  We also split an andouille and pesto pizza, which was freshly baked and light-tasting, despite the propensity of those ingredients to be heavy.  Both the owner and the cook came out to check on our party of four, our food was cooked quickly, our drinks were fresh,and we felt more at home than we do in most of our local bars back in Buffalo.  I can't suggest this place enough to locals and out-of-towners----you won't regret it.  Thanks again, Marc (sp?) and crew, for the wonderful Cleveland hospitality."}
{"text":"We were there during a very busy day, so I tried to cut them some slack... but the service was still terrible. We were there about 4 hours prior to first pitch, and they told us 45 minutes. After seating us 2 hours later, we ordered drinks and looked at the menu. After the waiter took our order, he told us that all food was on a 30 minute wait before they could cook it! So, why did you seat us and take our order?! We had to walk out, because we were NOT going to be late for a game which we were sufficiently early.  Under-staffed and not willing to admit it. I will not be back there, even though it is right across the street from the Jake."}
{"text":"Alright!  This was my first downtown bar/restaurant, and it didn't disappoint, although I had very low expectations.  My husband and his friend were looking to grab a beer and something quick to eat before the Indians/Tigers game tonight.  We sat down in a big booth.  At first I thought it would turn out grim, because nobody came over for a while.  But as soon as we were going to seek someone out, the waitress came over and was COMPLETELY attentive for the rest of the time.  She suggested a beer special, a \"pint\" (which was more like a pint and a half--so huge!) of Great Lakes Grassroots Ale for only 4 bucks.  Great!  She also brought us waters right away--a gesture that never goes unnoticed in \"bar and grill\" locations.  Our food was really good...better than we expected.  I had a turkey burger, which was seasoned really well and had a whole-wheat bun, plenty of toppings and cheese, and a side salad.  It was really delicious.  My husband had some really good wings, and his friend had the Smokehouse burger which he also liked a lot.  On the TVs in the background were, of course, sports, but also news, and it wasn't too loud.  A local middle-aged guy even came up to us to chat (in a non-annoying way) about the upcoming game when he noticed my husband and his friend were wearing Tigers shirts.  Just an overall friendly vibe.    Service continued to be great and even got speedier toward the end (I guess they realize that people want to get in and out for games or whatever).  It didn't disappoint, and in fact, I was pleasantly surprised and would go here again should the circumstance present itself."}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service. The location is great. Did I mention slow service?"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good however the service was terrible! Our waitress was rude and incredibly slow. She never came back after out food was delivered and it took close to 45 minutes to get our check. The tables with other waitresses were done long before we were."}
{"text":"Where the HELL did Cooperstown go?? I highly miss Alice Coopers' restaurant that used to be here, but decided to give this place a shot anyhow. DO NOT ORDER THE TIJUANA TUESDAY MARGARITA FOR $4.00. What a fucking joke. It was disgusting. I know better than to order a margarita from a random place like this, but thought I should give it a shot. Just stick to beer. Anyways, the service was 50/50, the guy didn't bock too much about splitting the bill for all of us 6 different ways, which was cool. I had the Tilapia dinner and I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Yikes Yelp! This place is a dump.  The former Alice Cooperstown. The former Local Heroes The soon to be former Good19Fellers  Yes, this play on Rapid Robert Feller's #19, posthumously uses the legendary Indian's persona to host an awful restaurant.  The menu, a laminated abomination of frozen goodies, stale offerings and a few fresh cut items.  The service...as dead as #19, and yes, he's still dead.  The food offerings look as if they've been reincarnated from the grave.  Stale, bland offerings that come out of the kitchen too quick to be fresh as they purport on their menu.  Their chicken tasted frozen...could have passed for a Swanson Hungry Man dinner or Stouffer's meal.  Fresh cut fries were delicious!  Really, what's it take for other restaurants to dump the frozen fries, press some potatoes and fry up some great fresh cut fries?  Service has gone way down hill since the days of Local Heroes.  Seems their long hiatus through the last poor attempt at a Cavs season has sent most of their good staff searching elsewhere.  So any of the few and I mean very few good people they had are long gone.  During our recent visit they were working on the broken jukebox.  So instead of having the repairman in before doors open, or after hours, they get the bright idea to BLAST the music at 1pm during lunch service.  When I write in other reviews, \"compared to other downtown offerings,\" this is effectively what I mean.  This place needs a 0-star rating, a new menu, some friendlier staff and a manager that can tell the repair people when it's appropriate for guests.  Mens' bathroom stall was busted.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Nice bar although very quiet early in the early afternoon. I stopped in the way to Tap City and was pleasantly surprised. I asked the gal (Very cute by the way) behind the bar to recommend a beer which she did. I tried the Breckenridge, it was great. I ordered some egg rolls which were good, although a bit light on stuffing. They tasted good with the Wasabi sauce. I would stop by again and say hello"}
{"text":"Wow!  I expected more from a place that had been closed for several months as the changeover from Local Heroes to Good Fellers.  It really looked like they gave about half the place a fresh coat of paint and that's it.  The food is the usual bar stuff except bar stuff tends to be a bit better.  I had the chicken soft tacos, which were very dry.  The two bright spots were the stuffed poblano pepper and the server was very friendly.   Oddly enough, the pepper came with tortilla chips that were fresh last night when they were first served to the customers.  I found this to be an odd and unnecessary combination.  There were at least 15 television monitors in the place, and they ALL had the same program on.  This is not good when you advertise yourself as a sports bar.  Probably won't frequent this place again unless all other food establishments close up....including the food carts!"}
{"text":"Good service! even though me and a couple of coworkers came here late. The bartenders were friendly and told us what was the chill spots in town."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I could call ourselves regulars here as the food, service and facilities make this a great lunch spot. We usually eat in the dining room past the lounge area and can hold conversations while watching the flat-screen tv's. I would recommend the salads-all good. The fries here are great as well. I guess I would say that don't just go here to drink before an Indians game, the lunchtime fare is worth the time to find a parking space and enjoy."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly! The sound system an tv's are on the same circuit. Which they decided to work on while we were in the restaurant. My chorizo app and chicken sandwich was DRY!  The bright spot was the fresh cut fries. For average (at best) bar food, the price was a bit over priced ( by about $1.50 per dish).  Nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Before a recent Indians game, I stopped in to Local Heroes. It was suprising and a nice change from the other restaurant and bar options in the area.  The servers and bartenders had great attitudes and the food was very good for a reasonable price. It has a spacious atmosphere, so you can sit down and eat or have a drink without people falling on top of you or sitting right next to you. I would definitely recommend Local Heroes to others."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'll give it 4 stars for its location and beer selection.  Great before and after an Indians game as long as you can get a place to plop down.  While there, I spoke with 2 gentlemen who said they frequent Heroes often and just love their food (from a man food perspective).  I'll stop back again."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Wouldn't make it a point to come back..."}
