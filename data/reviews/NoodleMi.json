{"text":"Ordered the $8.99 pick your own noodles and toppings dish and everything tasted like nothing. Got the Malay laksa and it was bland. They gave some free pork cutlet and it was bland as well. Service was okay, but it could be better. All in all, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pros: Good service, nice cozy feel, and cheaper prices Cons: Taste is inferior to Deer Garden and Magic Noodle, need to have better hot sauce, and provide choice of egg noodle.  Overall, this restaurant is trying to do what other places are already doing, but not as well. I'd rather pay more and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A new noodle shop in town beckons a try! This little shop is located in the Jubilee Plaza. At first glance of the menu, my Yelp instincts told me that their rice dishes look better than their noodles. But I felt obligated to try their noodles since they are called Noodle Mi. The menu set up is much like that of Deer Garden noodle shop. You pick and choose your soup and noodle toppings. We ordered a Japanese pork bone soup with vermecelli noodles. A side order of wings, and Taiwanese popcorn chicken. We also ordered Japanese curry with pork cutlet on rice.  ..The verdict...My Yelp instincts are spot on!. The rice dish was flavourful and beautifully presented. The noodle soup I ordered was bland and tasteless. So note to self on my next visit: focus on the rice dishes.  (Tip: They offer afternoon tea specials starting at 2:30. Mostly noodle dishes tho)."}
{"text":"A great place to have Asian style noodles, different from a typical Japanese noodle house, lots of choices on what you can put in, service is kind of slow but nice.  Would return again"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef bone soup with beef brisket and Vietnamese sausages. Also ordered a side of Taiwanese popcorn chicken   I found the soup lacking flavour. They do give you a good amount of meat though. The popcorn chicken lacks seasoning and batter.   Their menu is limited. Offering the soup noodles and a few rice dishes. When the menu is so limited, it's crucial to ace all the dishes. There is room for improvement."}
{"text":"We went back last weekend at 6:30pm but their door was locked. No explanation."}
{"text":"This place is a bit on the smaller side, but it's definitely cozy. My other half and i like noodles and decided to give this place a try. The broth options are quite similar to deer garden (right across the street) though this place does have different ingredients you can choose from. The portions are quite decent, and the food came out quite quickly.  The popcorn chicken could use a bit more batter to give that extra crunch and flavor, but it is quite juicy and meaty. The toppings were all a healthy portion too, though the beef brisket did seem to be cut in the thinner side.  There really is nothing bad about this place, but at the same time nothing truly note worthy. Customer service was very good and friendly  It's definitely has its own charm and it's worth a try if you want to have a quieter, cozy dinner.  Would definitely come again, hope they can improve as they have potential."}
{"text":"Cozy place with good seating. Comfort foods. Hainan chicken rice is yummy and comparable with other nearby places, and you can get a hearty Japanese curry as well."}
{"text":"This is probably a good restaurant! New and clean environment with good service! Food is good especially the ' hainanese chicken rice', must try, also the the noodle is good too, real taste and no msg, Tom yum spicy soup is good for people who like spicy, overall everything is good and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars to Noodlemi not because their food was horrible or because service was terrible (the server was in fact very friendly and polite) but because nothing stood out for me and their food lacked good taste.  Perhaps I made a poor choice of ingredients for my noodles but in general everything tasted very bland. Slightly cheaper than Deer Garden and with fewer options, this place offered noodles in a soup of your choice at $8.99, with two toppings and a drink. I chose the thin noodles in pork bone broth, king oyster mushrooms and red sausages. My friends also noted that their noodles were rather tasteless. I also tried their popcorn chicken which tasted mediocre. There's certainly room for improvement!"}
{"text":"NoodleMi might not be the best noodle shop in the neighbourhood but it is A-OK.   The usual self choice combination noodle combo for $8.99 or you can order one of their preset menu. All day combo and the better valued Afternoon Tea Set from $4.99 which both includes a choice of drink.  Feels like a family run/own restaurant as the wait staff though friendly but trying hard to keep up with the demanding customers. Hopefully, the staff would improve over time with more practice!  Taiwanese Fried Chicken Vermicelli Soup ($5.99) with Milk Tea The chicken itself was quite moist but a little more seasoning in the batter might have improve the flavour! The soup noodle was hot and comforting. Ask for some chili oil to spice it up if that's what you prefer.  Grand Opening 10% off and at this low pricing, I could said it is value for the money."}
