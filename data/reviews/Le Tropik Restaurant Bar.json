{"text":"Ate here for Dinner and Breakfast.  Dinner: Buffet was available, but opted to order off the menu. Ordered the club sandwich and it was OK. The chicken/turkey was very salty and i expect it was pre-frozen food that was defrosted.  Drinks: Poor beer selection, but that seems to be typical of many hotel bars. Mixed drinks were fine.  Breakfast: Buffet was included in my hotel stay. Decent spread, but nothing jumped out as amazing."}
{"text":"Well, I got back to my room and fell asleep. Woke up at dinner time and wanted something in walking distance....Low and behold a highly rated restaurant here in the Holiday Inn! I'm saved! I walked to dinner and sat facing the tropically landscaped large atrium like area of the hotel -- quite pleasant. As it turned out, the friendly bartender, whom I had met the night before, also was covering a couple of tables while tending bar. I had a soup that wasn't particularly memorable -- which is why I'm not telling what kind it was.....I don't remember... I also had a seafood Linguini that had a good assortment of sea critters in it, albeit very small pieces. It was a bit on the bland side for my taste, so I dumped a bunch of what appeared to be powdered Parmesan cheese. I prefer grated, but this was straight out of the Kraft can. Rodger, the friendly bartender kept my wine glass renewed and made good conversation. Bottom line, a solid 3 star experience bolstered by the glass of wine I was able to take back to my room!"}
{"text":"Day 8 of my penance, stuck here in the warehouse area of Montreal near the airport. Decided to finally try the breakfast here at the hotel.  All in all not bad at all.. (hey it rhymes, how did I pull that off so easily lol)  For 11.95 it was a pretty nice spread for a breakfast buffet especially when you concider that a ala cart meal is about the same price.  One of the short comings of a breakfast buffet is the eggs. In this case they had some have decent cooked scrambled, which I abore bit I found out if you want made to order Sunnyside up and so forth, they are happy to make them for you no extra charge... wow really??? I almost fell over.  They have a nice fruit station and also cereal and tea. Nice pastries and the bacon and sausages where really decent for a change.  The only  omplaints I have is the service can be a bit slow and they are not too at tentative to the bread station as it ran out of sliced bread and I never saw it refilled.  I like the fact that you get a stainless coffee carafe on your table and it's it's a nice atmosphere."}
