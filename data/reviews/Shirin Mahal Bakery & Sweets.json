{"text":"love love! my fav is the pineapple rolls. keep coming back for more. Thank you for the wonderful cakes you had made for us in the past. See you soon"}
{"text":"I like this place. Sweets are good quality and chicken patties are delicious ! Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to taste good Indian - Pakistani sweets !"}
{"text":"Yay I M a fan, if you want good quality halwa poori in GTA, this is your place to be, they'll give you two pooris halwa and chickpeas, potato curry, pickle and sweet for less than 8 bucks, the desi tea is extra. All of the above mentioned is really worth having, yeah and the people who're not from subcontinent probably won't be too scared going in, there aren't too many seats tables available, this is a full fledge bakery and sweet shop and quite expensive at that, the sweet flavours are authentic pakistani. and i have just realized i am rambling, but people i gotta say I love their food, but at the rate their prices have climbed i am finding it difficult to keep pace, and losing patience fast......"}
{"text":"The best sweets in Canada especially Samosa. Will recommend everyone to go to that place."}
{"text":"Very clean pakistani bakery with a variety of sweets, cookies and salty options. We love the gulab jamun there. It has a home made taste that you wont get in other stores. Their potato patties are also great - i think they are made with ghee - cant go wrong with that!  Prices are a little steep but you get what you pay for.  Definitely recommemded!"}
{"text":"This is a Pakistani bakery (or so it seems based on the products). Place looks clean but customer service is very bad. Every time I have been there, have had to literally fight my way through the order. Menu is very confusing and the amount of food you end up paying for is fuzzy at best. Sometimes it is not enough. I ordered 8 Puris and got 7 and that after the lady on the counter being down right confrontational with me. I won't be going back again. Food quality has already been described in a review below although I have not found it to be that bad."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars only because the Mithai is good, though over-priced. But the service at this place continues to be such a disappointment, the ladies behind the counter are unbelievably rude and behave as if they're doing us a favour and giving the sweets for free. If you ask for a 1 pound box the contempt is written all over their faces. I'm sorry I can't buy pounds of mithai just to appease you. When you're in a business like this learn to treat your customers with some respect, your attitude has forced me to look for other bakeries that sell mithai."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the quality of sweets -- it felt like rasgulla had kind of rice flour mixed in it. Kalakand was missing khoa. Never stepping into another Shirin Mahal ever."}
{"text":"This is a decent Pakistani bakery and you can find pretty much all the mithai (sweets), biscuits, cakes, patties, kachori, samosas and they offer halwa puri breakfast as well.

The store is quite big and clean. They have put in some tables and a TV so people can have a seat now as well. 

I get stuff from here all the time and I don't think I have been disappointed anytime. The service is good, the folks tend to be as fast as possible but it takes time when selecting sweets. Pricing is a little high but that with every bakery in town, you are paying for quality here.

For my Muslim Brother and Sister - They serve halal meat in their patties and Kachories"}
{"text":"Everything I had was mediocre except the chicken patiz which was really good. The samosa was terrible. I was shocked how someone can make such terrible samosa."}
{"text":"This place has been here for long time

Classic Clean Setup 

Good Chicken Patties

Good location 

I haven't tried anything else but the patties never fail"}
{"text":"The cookies and the chicken paiteez are amazing. I like this location more than the one in Scarborough. Amazing...makes me miss Pakistani bakeries."}
{"text":"We always get the lb of cookies and chicken paiteez. Tried beef but wasnt a huge fan, chicken is the way to go. The cookies are great."}
{"text":"Good selection of Pakistani desserts or traditional sweets. Excellent chicken patties, which is a necessary staple at many bakeries in Pakistan. They also have a good selection of cookies. Very good traditional Pakistani breakfast served on weekends. 

The  BF includes Halwa Puri and Chana. Halwa is a semolina dessert, puris are fried tortillas, and  Chana is chick peas. Served with pickles. Tea is served separately.

Service can be downright indifferent. Watch when your cookies are being packed. They sometimes throw them in the bag carelessly and many a pieces may be broken.
Nice sitting area.

It is better than many of its competitors including Al Mukarram. Despite bad service it now has 3 locations, that is a pity but a common trait of many Desi businesses.

It is  comparatively more expensive than other East Indian sweet sellers. Desserts are about $10 per lb.

A focus on service will make it the best Pakistani or East Indian bakery and seller."}
{"text":"The mithai is good only around eids. We made a special effort to drive down to the Mississauga location on three different occasions. Two weeknights and a Saturday. The mithai was stale and hard all three times. I know that is not the way it usually is because we always buy lots of mithai at eid and it'a so fresh that it melts in your mouth. The owners really need to implement quality control checks."}
{"text":"One of the worst sweet places I have ever been. I have been here multiple times and the sweets are just okay. They're not great. But their customer service is the absolute worst. They are rude and act as if you are bothering them by coming into the store to buy their product. I would not recommend this store to anyone. There are much better places with better service."}
{"text":"The review is primarily for halwa puri breakfast.

Was there for breakfast this weekend (halwa puri). it looked like It isn't a dine in place but they put tables and chairs on weekends for breakfast, i say that because there was so much space that was not utilized and it looked the tables were haphazardly placed. Puris were extremely oily, even more oily than the one they make back home, and they didnt give paper towel or anything to wipe the oil of it (newspapers are given back home to wipe the oil, not hygenic, but useful nonetheless).

The potato and chickpeas gravies are good, but the puris are an oily turn off, I wouldn't go there again for breakfast.

The service is not bad and they do have tasty collection of sweets."}
{"text":"What a lovely little bakery! This place is a new tradition for my family. We visit every weekend and pick out biscuits for tea. We also by puffs filled with spicy beef. I even picked up my husband's birthday cake from Shirin. 
All sweets are sold at a flat rate in either half or one pound boxes. $10/pound. 
The bakery shop staff are cute. They're always eager to pinch my daughter's cheeks and fill our box with different biscuits. I recently discovered their rusk and can't think of a cup of chai without it. Yes, it has all the crunchy goodness one would expect in rusk, only lighter and fresher. Delish! 
What a perfect find!"}
{"text":"This is a nice bakery. It's clean and has tables for seating. It does have a tv as well. It seems like they have a breakfast menu and a lunch menu. They have all sorts of desserts, mithai to be exact. But they also have cakes. I like those curry puffs, they have beef, chicken and veggie!"}
{"text":"Last week we purchased some beef and chicken pastries from here and they were fabulous; however, they were slightly cold :( hence the 4 stars. 

Moreover, I purchased some cookies as well and I really enjoyed them. To be fair, the cookies come from a unique set, and if you are familiar with Pakistani style cookies, then you will love this place. Photos attached below."}
{"text":"It's really delicious sweets and samasas , after a long time, I ate  like a home made sweets . I appreciate and thanks Shirin Mahal , really you deserve it . Friends you should try ."}
{"text":"I've only tried the mithai from here.  I'm taking off two stars for the price. It's delicious but seriously over priced.  More expensive than anywhere else in gta and anywhere else I've tried in the states (Chicago, Atl, houston, New York, LA) I just didn't think this kind of mithai was worth that much.    
For people that do not find it over priced, go for it."}
{"text":"Shirin Mahal Bakery & Sweets does look a little out of place in this plaza which most of the other stores are either Chinese, Vietnamese or  T & T Supermarket.

If you have a sweet teeth... a really sweet teeth... you are at the right place. 

If you want to be overdose with Pakistani sweets, you definitely can at Shirin Mahal.

Today I just want some \"biscuit\" and cookies... and I am not disappointed with the selections... And surprisingly they are really crisp, light and not overly sweet.... 

The only compliant I have to get at least $10.50/1 lb....?! How can I finish that? Why can't I just get a dozen or so?! I guess my coworkers at work are in luck today!"}
{"text":"Lovely small place to have good bakery stuff. I was so surprised that some chocolates were using golden foil"}
{"text":"We had a breakfast combo with puris, katlama, meat katlama, halwa, chickpeas and pickled onions at 10:30am on a Saturday. Everything was incredibly oily. The puris and katlama were pretty much indelible, you could feel the oil gushing into your throat as you take a bite. We could only finish half our meal and we felt disgusted for hours after we left. As we were leaving, we politely told the staff that the food was a bit too oily and she responded really poorly. She said \"that's how it's supposed to be\" and \"our food is good, that's why people come\". I find that very disappointing. When a customer gives you feedback, you should apologize that they didn't have a good experience and thank them for their feedback rather than responding defensively and telling the customer they are wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent Pakistani bakery 
Good rus malai desert 
Good mithai
If you want to feel that you are in pakistan, go in there . You won't be disappointed"}
