{"text":"Excellent service, delicious good and very polite staff. Worth giving a shot. We ordered Udon Noodle Soup, sushi platter and salmon platter. Salmon was very fresh and the rolls were very well made. The Udon soup is definitely worth a recommendation."}
{"text":"This sushi place is very good!!!! All very yummie and beautifully presented :)  Niki was great!  Definitely a place to come back =D"}
{"text":"Since moving to Toronto this is easily the best sushi restaurant I've ate at. Welcoming and attentive staff. The sushi rolls we ordered were so fresh and well presented. We were even brought a complimentary sample of a dynamite rice wrap roll. It was a spur of the moment decision to check this place out and we'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The customer service is awful! I placed an order for delivery and when it didn't arrive an hour and a half later I called and they told me it was to be picked up. I said I asked for delivery and I could not pick up and they then yelled and told me I wasted their food. I will not eat here again"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats. Took like an hour and  a half. The rolls were mushy and I think the avocado was bad. The dumplings were cold and disgusting."}
{"text":"We've made a habit lately of quantity over quality with sushi, but decided to splash out. You definitely get what you pay for. This place is amazing, in terms of taste and attention to detail this is one of the city's best. Some of the freshest cuts of fish that I've had in Toronto. Service is also excellent."}
{"text":"I was a little put off by the prices, higher than expected. But, when we got the food I honestly couldn't complain. The Food: Tempura shrimp- a little on the higher price side but the pieces are decent and great tasting.  Spicy salmon roll-a tad pricier then expected but the quality put into this \"FAR\" surpasses the couple bucks. Avocado and the avocado/cucumber rolls(avocadoQ), the chef is an artist they put a generous amt of vegetables instead of a thick amount of rice around the sushi. You can see they have pride here for sure! Delicious and much healthier. The staff: Very kind and friendly. The Restaurant: Clean, great atmosphere, soft accompanied music. I HAVE TO RATE THEIR FOOD QUALITY AS 5. ANYTHING LESS WOULD BE DISHONEST. I am new to the area and was searching for a new spot. I found it!!  Won't bother going anywhere else as long as this restaurant keeps up with the quality I was given today.  I only went to 1 place ever in Ajax b/c no one could compare. I have to say this spot is much better."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over Toronto and this is by far my favorite. The chefs are very authentic. The staff is extremely courteous. The food is always very fresh. They have fresh cut flowers. And the value is so good it is almost absurd.  Pro tip get the salmon or tuna sashimi. The dumplings are also fantastic. Have had most of the rolls and you can't go wrong.  Three dishes for two people are normally enough."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. We had lunch. Our experience was average with nothing to boast about. The miso was good; seaweed based sunoumo salad was on target with no fishy after taste and perfect amount of crunch; the udon lunch combo was vegetarian, was adequate, not a lot of veggies, slightly mushy noodles, too greasy with too much tempura bits, broth was too salty, but it was hot and size was fine; the kalbi was subpar with good flavor but small singed pieces which were not as tender and succulent as at Dani's; with the kalbi lunch combo, I got just a small bite of side seaweed and soy glass noodle; the fish on the sushi rolls were watery and didn't have the bright taste that makes sashimi so delightful; the California rolls were dominated by cucumber bits and taste; the wasabe was dull and didn't have any kick; the tea was too watery and missing that roasted rice flavor. Overall, portions were fair, service was attentive and friendly. This is an ok place to go for a bite but it won't be our go-to Japanese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. I keep coming back for more. It's the best sushi place in the Toronto area. The sushi is fresh. I've found that the maki rolls at a lot of places are mostly filled with rice, but not here. They have a great filling-to-rice-ratio. Also, if you decide to eat in they have real flowers at each table! It's a reflection of hi na's attention to detail that I love. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, presentation was excellent but I prefer fast service vs fresh flowers displayed on my plate. Nice, quiet place. 2 special rolls for $30.00.   You be the judge."}
{"text":"Service was great!!! I love hina sushi!! Their rolls are so pretty and delicious! Each ingredient in maki blend in so well and u dun even need extra sauce to take it with! Small restaurant. Food is so refreshing!"}
{"text":"We had the Agadashi tofu, tempura sushi, California roll and sushimi.  Agadashi tofu was excellent. The tempura sushi and California rolls were extremely fresh and very thin layer of rice. Really delicious.  I've had better sushimi but that was good too. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Just moved to New Toronto and this place has become my new go-to when I get a craving for sushi. Staff is friendly, venue is clean.  Love the complimentary apps! The maki rolls are delicious and the chef seems to take pride in presentation and execution.  Particularly like the torch rolls, reminds me of Vancouver sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing service, friendly staff, best sushi we've ever had! Always exceptional presentation, and fresh sushi. We usually receive free extras courtesy of the chef! The restaurant is clean with modern decor and fresh flowers. Easy to access and we have yet to wait a prolonged period of time for our food."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced Hi Na to me a couple of years ago and I've been championing this venue ever since. Their prices (for Toronto sushi) is borderline pricey, however, for the quality of the fish you receive - it's well worth the money - and then some. Hi Na is located west of the Downtown core (Etobicoke/Toronto) in Mimico, which is an up and very coming location for more quaint and higher end gastro pubs. It's not quite there yet in terms of back to back restaurants, but it's slowly getting there.  The service is standard for Japanese resto as they are very courteous and respectful. The Lobster, Spider and Unagi Dragon rolls are delicious. Quite frankly, all their rolls are above the norm in terms of quality, taste and freshness. They are one of the few that serves great sushi, sashimi, cooked and specialty items that are of all high quality.   If you haven't been to Hi Na's before and you are a fan of quality fish - without paying the prices of Ki and Hiro's downtown... then this is definitely worth a trip!  You get what you pay for... and then some."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats, food arrived 1.5 hours later. I order a maki set with sashimi combo for me and my guest. We were hungry and staring at the uber eats app as no driver picked up the food until 1 hour later and took 30 minutes to drive 2 km. My food has been sitting there for who knows how long. I don't think anyone wants to eat sashimi raw fish that's sitting on the counter and in the delivery drivers car for 1.5 hours.    While I was sitting here hungry and waiting for my order, not once I got some type of call/notification from restaurant or uber driver regarding the extreme lateness. I don't blame everything on the driver. Restaurant has to be responsible for coordinating their business with uber.  The food was very soggy by the time I got it from the uber eats driver. Perhaps it would've been better if it didn't take so long to reach the customer. I'm giving 1 stars because the food was still in edible condition.   I don't really recommend this place. If you do end up ordering, order 1.5 to 2 hours in advance. If you don't want to eat your dinner at 10:30pm at night.  Overall, spent $40 with tax and delivery charge for soggy food. Messaged and Called uber, uber said they don't give a sh*t. No refund or apology from Uber or Restaurant. Awful experience.   Stay away from ordering from here!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just had dinner here and not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent and so was the decor. They have definitely elevated themselves above and beyond the typical Japanese restaurant. My only complaint is that they don't offer brown rice which would have been a nice addition. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great service and the rolls were fantastic. Presentation was surprisingly beautiful. Awesome quality as well worth the extra price. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"My hubby and I found this place while trying to wait out the evening rush hour. We ordered the Hina Sashmi special and Dynamite roll. Each piece  melted in your mouth. Great service, reasonable price and large portion. Very well presented dishes and quite an extensive menu for a Japanese restaurant. Can't wait to be back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"This was the second visit and likely our last. The service and presentation were great. The resto is clean. The food was disappointingly bland. I asked for more spicy mayo to make it palatable, it still didn't work. For what we paid it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi restaurant. I ordered the tampura with 6 pieces of sushi, and I must say that for a very reasonable $12, it was definitely worth it. Food is delicious, restaurant interior design is appealing. Staff serving was friendly. Overall, would recommend and would return for another lunch."}
{"text":"Fish is fresh. Good portions. Friendly staff. Always offers tea while I wait for my pick up order. Wish they gave some kind of discount for regular customers. We find it pricey."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meals here and after a day at work, this is my personal reward for hard work!!!! I lovvvvve HiNa restaurant!!!! And NOW.....open Monday's too!!!! Yayyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is great.  I really like quick delivery and this is by far the best sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"We were planing to go to sushi 2 go but it was closed for reno. By luck we went here!!! The place is totally dead not sure if it was cause lunch or it's new. Decor is simple yet classy, plating was unexpectedly fancy! The food wow! From the miso soup to the free appetizer to the main course even the the dessert was great!!! Everything was superb and very worth coming back even though it was pricy! Well worth the extra dough!"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday afternoon for lunch. Very cute and intimate atmosphere. Wanted to try out this local gem as a lot of reviews raved about this place. Prices are on par with other standard sushi places but their lunch specials are very fare in price. I had the spicy salmon and spicy scallop lunch special. Came with miso soup and salad. The rolls were very nicely done in terms of the fish and rice ratio. Fish being 85% and rice being only 15%. The rolls are also huge (not like other sushi joints that make their rolls tiny).   Definitely wanting to come back to try their sushi boats! Looks delish and can't wait to try their take out service next time"}
{"text":"A perfect choice in the Lakeshore-Queensway area. We have tried a handful of Sushi restaurants locally and are always impressed by Hina. The location is great, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is refreshing and clean.  We most often order pick-up, and the food is always ready when we arrive, and very fresh. We have ordered the Medium Sushi & Maki Patter several times now, which is $48 for 42 pcs. and the quality is fantastic. No fishy chlorine after taste like some other places!   Definitely recommend. And I look forward to trying something new each time!"}
{"text":"Very pricey sushi for something that doesn't offer much more than the run of the mill below average sushi restaurants. nickel and dime every single change, and not very flexible with special requests.  for much better sushi experience, for not a lot more, there is sushi kaji down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent composition and attention to detail. From the Udon to the sashimi, everything spot on. Fresh, quality fish. I've already returned since my first visit last month."}
{"text":"Best a-la-carte in the area. We ordered the love boat and it came decorated with flowers and beautiful, skillfully cut sushi shapes including a sashimi butterfly. The soup and salad were well balanced. Service was attentive too. Can't wait to com back again."}
{"text":"Very good, solid sushi joint. Updated this from a three star because i either didn't get the right stuff the first time or was mentally incapacitated. Possibly the latter.  The maki rolls are very good, quality of the sushi is great, decent value for the price, and makes you just want to come back. It's consistently delicious.   The items we got: the spicy salmon and spicy tuna, better-than-average for a pretty standard roll choice. The spicy dynamite roll, very tasty, flavorful. And the smokey roll, wrapped in seaweed, but really nicely balanced with fish, rice and holiday gift wrap... One feature, the sashimi combination platter -- delicious, and better than most sashimi since it tasted just so damn fresh.  Other things I've had include the Alaska roll and snowman roll, the satu roll... And all just really tasty. The big feature of this place is the size of the maki rolls. Ginormous. Not super cheap, but you can probably order 75% as much as somewhere else and be totally stuffed. Local love for my neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"The sushi is always delicious and decorated so pretty, I love it. The reason im only giving this 3 stars is because I could hear the chef calling my friend and I idiots and loud in Korean which is so rude and it made me really angry that they expected us to be super quiet when we were just talking in a normal indoor voice. I'd order take out but after this I don't think I would sit down to eat again."}
{"text":"The avocado used in my roll was rotten - dark brown and slimy. Just disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"Cute little place!  Ambiance: it was so quiet and the furniture was nice. They could put a little more space between the door and the exit though. Otherwise, very nice.  Service: he was accommodating, didn't rush us, and gave us what we needed.  Food: it was great, really. The presentation was lovely, the taste was delicious. For the price, you get what you pay for. Like, I'm not complaining so much that I didn't get what I'd get at a 5* sushi restaurant. Lol. But I'm coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Good lunch specials( had the sashimi and the veggie sushi specials) very nice and courteous service, fresh tasty food. Decent value for money too. Close to Costco too if you feel like skipping the hotdogs there."}
{"text":"Very nice selection, quality and presentation.  It's a bit pricy, but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the area and the miso soup is delicious. Was a bit frustrated as my sushi kept falling apart."}
{"text":"I cannot even tell you how good this place was. Great food. Fantastic decor. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times. The salmon sushi roll , beef teriyaki and grilled tuna are really good just the sashimi tastes like frozen fish everyone and it's too cold and hard to eat"}
{"text":"Solid menu, affordable and authentic. A la cart pricing but massive speed flavourful rolls of sushi goodness. Loved the dynamite, rainbow and California rolls and also had an order of the kalbi (beef short ribs). Dinner came with miso soup and some delicious hot teas with a bottomless refill opportunity. Will visit here again if I'm in the big city."}
{"text":"Groupon.  No real deal.  They dream up total price and then a discounted price and put it on Groupon.. False advertising.  Hence low rating.  Else the food was ok, not unlike other sushi places."}
{"text":"I used to love Hina. I ordered through Uber eats recently and the quality of the sushi rolls have gone down from 10/10 to 5/10. See picture comparison. These are both spicy salmon. I understand the pretty presentation was because I ate in the restaurant and the other pic is take-out but it used to be the same sushi quality even when I order for take-out/delivery. They put waaaaay too much spicy mayo on the spicy salmon/tuna now and I like the seaweed around the fish and rice instead of the other way. The size of the roll has significantly become smaller as well. Anyways, I'm done going to Hina and ordering for take-out/delivery. #sorrynotsorry #baiiii"}
{"text":"This place is pretty dang good!! This is the epitome of quality and quantity!   While I was driving down queensway on a Tuesday Night, I had noticed that most sushi restaurants are closed on a Tuesday...WHAT?! That's something I didnt know...but now I know. So finally my friend spotted this place OPEN! And the Sushi Gods have spoken!! I was really craving for it so thank goodness! Although it was about to close they told us that they can still do take out which was fine with me.   The staff were kind and the place is cute and small with lots of dry roses displayed. It can fit about 30 people I would say.  I would also like to point out that they carry Torched Sushi!!!!! The greatest thing ever! So we ordered torched volcano roll and spider roll. Let's break this volcano roll down...it comes in 8 rolls and they're super stuffed with salmon, avocado, cucumber and topped with tempura bits and shredded spicy salmon and then torched...OMG BEST THING EVER! I really couldn't fit it all in one bite. The best thing about it is you can eat the fallen toppings after! The spider roll is like any other spider roll but the lightness and crispness of the soft shell Crab is to die for and not to mention that they are the biggest rolls ever!  If you're ever down on queensway on a Tuesday...know that this place is open :)"}
{"text":"What a surprise find!  We didn't know the area well, so we queried on Yelp for 2 $$ restaurants.  Yelp led us to this little Japanese restaurant that rocks a 4.5 stars average rating.    We ordered a medium Sashimi Combination Platter, a Lobster Roll and a Philadelphia Roll.  The portion of the sashimi platter was generous.  The sashimi was fresher than AYCE and as fresh as any non-AYCA restaurants in the GTA.  The rolls were okay.  Both the Lobster Roll and the Philadelphia Rolls were fresh.  The rice layer was quite thin.  The presentation of the lobster rolls was beautiful, but the taste of lobster didn't stand out.  The Philadelphia roll, as standard as it was, tasted more satisfactory.  For improvement opportunity, I wish the rolls were more tightly rolled.  The decoration of Hina is very nice.  The ambiance was like a cross between a restaurant and a lounge.  Contemporary yet grown up.  Usually restaurants with this level of ambiance has a higher price range, and Hina is not.  Services was average.  The waitress was courteous and effective if detached.  Food alone 3.5 stars.  Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered uber eats  20 minutes prior to closing. I waited for a hour and half. I wasn't notified by either group so I waiting for hour half until 3 called to uber eats. Stand by you're hours."}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Also, not good for vegetarians- very little choice and not great quality. But apparently the non-veggie rolls were good.   Also, delivery time through uber eats was WAY longer than advertised."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find great sushi in Etobicoke and I wish I found this place sooner. Apparently it's been here for ages but I never noticed it.   It's a cute little place and our server was very sweet. What I liked about this place is the effort they put into their food. The plating is beautiful and they have some really creative menu items. The sushi is tasty too, which of course, is the main reason I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Still a favorite in Etobicoke. The food is great, as is the service. A small change to the music inside would be a wonderful improvement for the ambiance.  And it seems that most people have still not discovered this place as it never seems really business....whcih is good for getting great service."}
{"text":"Omg!!! I can't believe I didn't know about this place!!! Incredible food and so fresh!! Amazing service and great prices! Definitely will be coming back! I had the Spicy Tuna Lover Roll, Salmon Sashimi and tried a piece of my friends Polar Bear Roll...absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy some Korean dishes along with your sushi. I got the beef short ribs meal with a sushi combo and shrimp tempura. Loved that they gave 5 pieces of shrimp instead of the usual three as with restaurants."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Extremely friendly staff! We celebrated anniversary and made it perfect!"}
{"text":"Hina is so... Hina (the Japanese word for small/cute)!  Walking in for the first time, the place felt classy and intimate, but still homey. I ordered a dinner combo with a salad, big ol' bowl of udon and the A&S (avocado and salmon) dragon roll. Everything was very rich in taste, and the presentation was top notch. The sushi chefs here are really good at what they do. The shiitake mushrooms that came with my meal were mind-blowingly good.  I was alone and doing some schoolwork, and my server adjusted perfectly to that situation. She checked in/refilled my green tea often enough to make me not feel neglected (lol), but not so often as to interrupt my work.  For $22 (before tip), I was happy/satiated and had some leftover udon which I enjoyed the next day. This is definitely one of the best sushi spots in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Hi Na is a very sweet little restaurant and the food is delicious, affordable, and carefully created and plated by the chef. The best casual sushi restaurant in the area for sure, considering others on Queensway and Bloor St....! Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"The sushi here is unreal. Absolutely mastered by the chef. You always get what you pay for here even though it's pricey. I recommend the Volcano roll. Delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Food-wise?  Same freshness as my usual places in 'ssauga (Hinote, Sushi Park).  Plating?  More attention is paid on this front.  So that's something that you'll definitely notice!  Service?  Fine, no compaints.  Even received some sort of complimentary spicy roll with crab, tobiko, avocado in a rice paper (2pcs) which was a nice touch.  Price?  Uh...here is where you'll notice that Hina is on the pricier side, especially considering the area - with not much happening.  \"Special Rolls\" (think:  sauces, deep fried) were at least $12, some handrolls were $6/ea, & dinner entrées were at least $18-20.  Hint:  If you're in the area, stop by for LUNCH to get a sense for the food.  And if you like the food, check them out for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite sushi place in Etobicoke. The interior is very stylish and the service is prompt. The food itself is absolutely amazing - all the rolls are huge and stuffed with ingredients. My favourite was the apple cider roll which was delicious. The presentation of the food was also above average which is nice to see.   One downside is the cost - this is not a place I would go on an average day due to the price. Some of the rolls are more than $15. I do highly recommend it once in a while though as I loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm very satisfied with high food quality and service. The rolls are very big, less rice but more inside and also the taste wonderful that I strongly recommend.  Beautiful interior inside, also the washroom was so clean and nicely decorated with fresh scent."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and they were great to deal with.  We had just take out, but everything was still done with care and presented nicely. The flavour was also on point for everything! They also wrote a little note for us to enjoy our food with a complimentary rice paper rolls on the house.  Had: Spicy Dynamite Maki  Spicy salmon rolls Smokey rolls Vegetable tempura Goyza soup Rice paper rolls  All was great. The smartest was they cut the top of the tempura box out so that the steam would escape, leaving our tempura still crispy and warm by the time we got it home!  I would definitely recommend...for the flavour and price this place is a steal!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that the service is excellent here. The food is also excellent. The presentation of the dishes is excellent. Just go now.  We tried the volcano torch, ss roll, spider roll, lobster roll, orangeville roll, and the sashimi platter. Te portions are huge. They also gave us two extra pieces of sashimi. Couldn't be happier. The portions are quite large also."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place. Sizable portions, good deals, high quality sushi, wonderful service, nice ambience, and the aesthetics are wow. You will not be disappointed.  It's a small-scale place so my boyfriend and I made reservations for Valentine's Day just in case, but when we got there, there were still a couple of empty spots. I looked around and the others had really nicely decorated sushi on wooden boats and platters which made me really excited to get our own. We ordered miso soup, seafood soup, shrimp shumai gyoza zensai(appetizer). I was really satisfied with the shrimp shumai gyoza but the seafood soup was too salty for me. Not a problem, I drank a lot of water(that was nice and didn't taste like tap water) and green tea. EVERYTHING looked delicious on the HI NA signature maki rolls menu but we ended up getting the sunshine, the spicy lobster, the Alaska, and the spicy crispy salmon. I was surprised when the huge wooden fish-shaped platter arrived, those were big portions.  This is no low-quality AYCE stuff. The rolls had a thin layer of rice and mostly ingredients. I don't know if the crabmeat was real but it sure tasted real. The salmon and caviar is top-grade sushi level. It turns out that since the portions were so big, 2 maki rolls for each of us was too much, so I decided to take home the 6 pieces left so that my little sister could try them. We had ice cream and once again, they decorated it wonderfully with chocolate sauce and MINIATURE FUNCTIONING TINY UMBRELLAS. Wow. Never seen those before in my life(maybe because I've never been to such a high-quality restaurant). They even put a cherry on top. So, I enjoyed my enhanced green tea ice cream and went to the washroom. When I came back, there was yet another surprise. The waitress gave me a small box of Hershey kisses and I thought oh my goodness can this place get any more perfect. She took good care of us throughout our stay, refilling our tea and making us feel comfortable. I had a wonderful experience, and would recommend this to any hardcore sushi lover. Honestly, this place was quite pricy for the amount that we had to order to get full, but for a special occasion it's unquestionably worth it."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here - ordered one of the red dragon roll and another salmon roll (forgot the name). We both agreed A+ for presentation/decoration of the food but C+ for food taste. The service was good, clean inside, cushioned seats were super comfortable.    But the food... the fried shrimp tempura inside the sushi tasted stale. It wasn't crispy and hot as it should be if it was freshly made. The salmon slices on top were thin and didn't taste fresh either. Eel slices on the dragon roll was very average as well. Perhaps we came during off-time (around 2-3pm) so we were the only customers in the restaurant hence they didn't have fresh food available."}
{"text":"Clean and pretty place, nice waitress , chicken udon soup was average with an ounce of chicken and beef teriyaki was imposible to eat as meat was as tough as jerky and they refuse to replace it with chicken, it is the worse teriyaki we have ever eaten too bad, we need good places in this area"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here from Uber eats one evening. The order was placed at 7:19 and the food was scheduled to arrive at 8:07. It didn't get to us till 8:52. On the way to us the teacher said that the driver was making another stop on the way which seemed to add to the time.  Food: we got the sushi and sashimi combo with after tax and delivery charges came to about $36 for 2 people. It was definitely ample food and came with a salad and a miso soup. The salmon was the nicest and seemed to be the most fresh.  Not much to rave about but your pretty standard sushi fare."}
{"text":"Ate the sushi platter for two. Great soy sauce, freshly made warm rice, decent fish portions, and nice staff. Extremely fresh. Very impressed."}
