{"text":"Absolutely delicious!

My family just came from rodos and we loved it! They had some of the biggest and best gyros I've ever seen. A gyro with a full pound of lamb cost only $5.50 and $6.00 with fries. I cannot recommnend it enough! Cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Kind of the Primantis of the gyro world.  Try the gyro special with fries.  It is huge. The fries are excellent, as is the house salad, which is identical to their Greek salad, but smaller and half the price.  Prices are very reasonable.
I had a lamb burger there, since I love lamb, but it was unfortunately very dry.  The menu is limited, (after all, your going there for Greek food), but sufficient if your main interest is gyros."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The best gyro's in the state hard to finish one especially if you get the fries too. I live in plum PA and will drive 45 minutes to get gyros here."}
{"text":"When you first walk into the restaurant you are hit with the delicious smell of Greek food.   The portion sizes are huge and the quality is excellent. Also, the staff is very friendly.   The classic Greek salad is my personal favorite - the lemon oil dressing is amazing."}
{"text":"Rodos is amazing...period.  I wish they accepted something other than cash, but it's well worth the hassle.  Plan on one meal equaling two.  The tomato, spinach, egg and feta is mmmm mmmm mmmm."}
{"text":"Best Gyro around!!! Hands down!!!
Service was good. Ask your server for the dinner specials, they change daily. So you know that it's a good scratch kitchen!"}
{"text":"Wow this place really needs help and not in the food department.. They have one lady taking care of everything at lunchtime she is waiting tables answering the phone running the cash register she might even be cooking.. But the place is full and the food is good.. Hope they last with the slow service.."}
{"text":"Knowing that we are gyro fanatics, my parents wanted to take us here to try the gyros (as they heard that they were really good). 

The Rodos Gyro did not disappoint! They put a TON of meat on the sandwich. I wasn't able to pick it up and had to eat some of the meat before I could. The veggies were fresh and the sandwich itself was really tasty. The sauce wasn't the traditional tzatziki sauce I am used to; but, it was still pretty good. Their fries are also crispy, fresh, and seasoned. 

My only complaints are:

It was freezinggg in there and I had to leave my coat on while eating.  

They serve ketchup packets in a cup for your fries rather than just ketchup on the tables/in the cup for dipping. 

While the prices are reasonable for the portions of food, they only accept cash. Beware before you go and expect that they accept cards."}
{"text":"If the spanokopita was better, I would have given this five stars.  We were wandering around the area & found this on Yelp & gave it a try.  I got the Greek side salad & spanokopita, Mike got the gyro, and we shared the zesty feta fries.  The fries were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside & fluffy inside.  The feta was tangy.  The salad was the perfect size to order & still have room to snack on the other items.  Mike loved the gyro.  I am looking forward to going back to try the entree items/dinner menu.    Cash only, but a bank ATM next door.  Good service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Have great food.  Unfortunately the waitress ruined it all.  Unfriendly and obviously in a hurry to go home.  They use to have a wonderful wait staff.  Never felt so rushed to leave.  Husband didn't even finish his meal.  She rushed right over with the check and a box.  Her attire was unprofessional.  Looked more like she was there to scrub walls.  Very disappointed.  Loved the food but won't go somewhere that doesn't appreciate customers."}
{"text":"(Cash only) I have loved Gyros my whole life, when Rodo's moved into the area I was pumped! The restaurant is very clean and has light music playing. The staff is very friendly and the service is great!  We usually get takeout because of the proximity to our house.

We always start with the grape leaves. There are 6 to an order and they are plump and tasty! Lots of flavor and are kept moist with a lemony/olive oil drizzle.  I could eat an order myself, we usually devour them standing in the kitchen before we open the rest of the food!

The gyros are ENORMOUS!!! Do yourself a favor by ordering an extra pita and sauce, it cost a couple bucks but it's worth it! You basically get 2 gyros in one!!! 

The Greek salad with chicken and Greek vinaigrette is phenomenal!! So many flavors combining to make a beautiful salad!! 

We always finish with their homemade Baklava.... It is just like your Yaya would make!! The honey, phyllo, and nuts are amazing! Today they had double chocolate  and it was great!

This is the best Greek food in the area you should definitely go!   I normally take pictures of my food to post to yelp, but we always eat this too quickly!!"}
{"text":"I picked up a takeout order from Rodos last night and it was just as fantastic as my dine-in experience back in November.  I called and ordered the usual Rodos Gyro and Pita Maria when I was about 20 minutes away... when I arrived, it had just come out of the kitchen and I was out the door in a few minutes.  I really wish they'd franchise or expand so I could have one of these gems in the Southside, but it's definitely worth the trip! I see from previous reviews that people come from all over for the food at Rodos and I don't blame them!"}
{"text":"Food is always outstanding! Fast and hot! The gyros are huge! Thanks or doing such a great job!"}
{"text":"Everyone hypes up the gyros. And for good reason, they're massive and they're the best. But the real star on this menu is the Lamb Burger. It's perfect. Do yourself a favor...."}
{"text":"* NOTE:  Cash Only 
I Love Gyro's and I Love Rodo's Greek Cafe, the best combination. Rodo's ,is a small Greek Restaurant. It may be small, but adequate to bring a family of twelve. We visit monthly, we can't get enough. The staff is friendly and helpful. We have always had great service. There has never been a long wait, and the food has been served hot. Prices are reasonable, do the research, without a doubt. 
We start with the Broiled Feta appetizer, an excellent dish served with pita chips. The Gyro's are HUGE!, huge enough that you can begin with a fork till small enough to pick up by hand. I love the Greek Salad with Gyro meat. It is a large salad I have trouble finishing. The tzatziki sauce is great, but I also like the Greek vinaigrette, order them both on the side. The lightly greek seasoned fries are great.  I have not had the Lamb Burger, but others have said it's terrific.  
We have taken Gryo's home to a family member. Never a soggy Gyro. Everything can be packed separately for travel. 
I also like the fact that they are a BYOB as well."}
{"text":"The app feta and olive plate was ok but overpriced at nearly $8 
They no longer offer \"dinners\" or \"pastas\" 
And if you like your gyro meat sliced thick like roast beef this is the place for you.
You also may want to request an extra pita...there is a lot of quantity to each gyro."}
{"text":"(Cash Only!)

We went here the other day on a friend, and fellow yelper's, recommendation. 

I enjoyed our food. 
I ordered a traditional gyro--it came with a ton of meat in it, and the meat, though traditional gyro style lamb meat, was much more flavorful than most, IMO.

My husband ordered a Greek salad with chicken and a wonderful huge chunk of feta cheese on top--Yum!


I'll keep it simple!

PROS:
Food was fantastic;
Portions were large;
Price was very reasonable;
THEY HAVE DIET DR. PEPPER!!


CONS:
Smallish interior dining area, but absolutely adequate for this little joint;
My bench was broken at our table;
There was dried brown gunk on the wall next to me, looked like it had been there for some time;
They don't take credit/debit cards--cash only!



(Warning:  The olives have the pits inside still--we found out the hard way!)

They do have a few sweet items too for after your meal.
i had the chocolate baklava, it was pretty good, but I'm still a fan of traditional!  ;)"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here. Don't let the location throw you off.  It always amazes me how good and friendly the waitresses are even though they are very young.  The gyro=to die for.  I always want to try something else, but the gyro and fries are just too good to pass up.  The Pita Maria appetizer is also outstanding.  I think it's BYOB too, but you should call and check to be sure."}
{"text":"Terrible lunch experience. What restaurant has 1 person working at lunch? Literally 1 person to cook, take orders and serve the food. I should have just left but I'm starving and walked here from work so now I'm stuck eating here and going back to work late. Never again!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Greek restaurant in Western PA, and I found one in Rodos Cafe.
I've passed this place in the past, but because it was called a cafe, I assumed it was a gyros restaurant. Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I was pleasantly wrong. The menu is filled with classic Greek cuisine and other foods with a Greek twist. There's your usually Gyros, lamb dishes, and on Friday's pasticcio, but there are also yummy items like the three Greek cheese pasta (my brother had it and it was creamy and yummy). 
For appetizers, we tried the broiled feta cheese, and the artichoke dip. The feta was lightly baked and gave it a creamy. dip-able texture, and the artichoke dip has lots of flavor. Both came with fried pita, which was amazing- I'd get the pita by itself if they have it, The salad that came with my entree was fresh and came with kalamata olives and big hunk of feta cheese, and their house Greek dressing was very good without being too oily. My meal was the souvlaki, which I was little disappointed with- souvlaki is usually lamb kebab, but this was a chicken and pork kebab (I wish there was a description that told you that). The pork was a bit dry, but the chicken had a great flavor and was very juicy. It came with a bed of lemon flavored orzo and slices of roasted eggplant, zucchini, and yellow squash. All were delicious. 
Next time, I'd like to try the lamb burger, which says it has roasted red peppers and feta cheese. I'd also recommend the gyros- my wife had it and the meat was perfectly cooked- and I really want to try their pasticcio.
In all, you won't go wrong with Rodos if you're in a Greek mood."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place in White Oak, probably the entire Pittsburgh area.  It's got a short menu, but what they do, they do well.  Spiced to perfection, huge portions, friendly, quick service.  I'd have given them 5 stars if they took credit/ debit cards; running to find cash is a pain!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on their Gyros. Huge. Delicious. Authentic. And the rest of their menu looks equally enticing."}
{"text":"I could eat that lamb burger everyday, the gyros are bigger than your head and cut with lightning from Zeus himself. Im pretty sure they got real greek goddesses in the back rolling the grape leaves too. I personally dont mind its a CASH ONLY establishment, I think that gives it a more old country feel . Plus if you enjoy a bottle of wine with dinner or you just like to party, they have a BYOB policy."}
{"text":"A simple little place. I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews, I guess I was expecting more with the stellar reviews. It didn't feel  or taste that spectacular.  It was good, more like a sandwich shop than a restaurant. Not a huge selection on the menu.

I had the gyro, it was super stuffed, something you eat more like a salad at first, then pick up. The taziki sauce was good. The Greek fries were just thick cut fries with a very light  dusting of oregano or something. Not much to brag on.

They do only take cash. But that is not a big deal to me. Not great, not bad. A decent place for what it is."}
{"text":"Great portions means value for money. The gyro is easily two or three worth of meat. Had no problem cooking the onions for me on request. Well seasoned and tasty. Plenty of other Greek fare on the menu as well, and equally well done of those I have had. Not a pizza place that just happens to have gyros. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Small menu, sparsley decorated space, plastic cups, oddly garnished plates. Ordered loads of food Tasty... not so pleasing on the eye. I would go back if i was around the hood, but i dont think it is a destination kinda place. 3 stars average. Own a restaurant ..try to improve daily."}
{"text":"This is a great Greek restaurant. I'm accustomed to the Greek, Italian, American restaurants where I live. This is a purely Greek restaurant. They do carry out and dine-in. This place is cash only.

My wife and I started with the Pita Maria - seasoned pita chips with artichoke hearts, spinach, diced tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and Greek sauce. This was a great appetizer. I great combination of ingredients and the pita chips added a nice crunch to go along with the . For my entree I got the Roman Greeco - a gyro with tomato pesto and cheese. This was an interesting gyro. I was unsure about the tomato pesto with my gyro, The pesto was a good change but I think I would prefer a more traditional gyro with tzatziki. The portion was huge, I was only able to eat about half of it. 

The service was great. The wait staff was attentive and checked on us throughout the meal. Overall a great place for a Greek meal."}
{"text":"They had the best gyros I have ever had. The price was so reasonable. The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was very pleasant. It's definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Came back to town from california and my mom took me to dinner here. It was amazing. I've had lots of gyros from all over the country, and Rodos has the best seasoned meat I've had. The prices are reasonable, and you get a ton of food. The pita maria appetizer is delicious. Fried pieces of pita topped with feta, spinach, and artichoke. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you like gyros, this is the place for you. The gyro is so large it will feed two. And the meat is Cooked to perfection. You can dine in or take out. Enjoy"}
