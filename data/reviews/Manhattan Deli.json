{"text":"My parents are \"regulars\" and the servers know what drinks to bring them before they sit down!  The food is excellent, and the service is always friendly.  I always enjoy stopping by whenever I am home!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Everything I have had is always fresh and good quality. My favorites are the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. The pickles they give you at the beginning of the meal are delicious! Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"We've had some really good things and some \"not so good' things here.  Good sandwiches, and Middle Eastern dishes.  Their specials are hit or miss but that wouldn't keep me from trying something different.  It's straight forward deli cookin'."}
{"text":"Not really sure where to start this review because my mind is spinning thinking about all the great things Manhattan Deli has to offer!  I've been frequenting MD for years now and I can say that you'll find one heck of a corned beef sandwich here!  Definitely one of my go to orders, but I've also tried their turkey sandwiches, soups (the matzo ball is to die for!), and their Mediterranean goodies (I'd list my favorites, but that would be all of them).  Oh and I'm pretty sure they put something in the pickles because they are addicting and oh so good!  So basically, if you're in the mood for a killer corned beef sandwich (or any sandwich for that matter), then head here because you'll walk out one satisfied little foodie!"}
{"text":"Sit down, sit down, you look famished! Doesn't your mother feed you? Oy!  Prepare for a sandwich experience.  From the free fresh and pickeled there pickles to the pounds of meat between bread so succulent you could eat a loaf on your own, the Manhattan Deli is one of the best sandwich shops in Ohio. Have never been to NYC, I can't compare it to a real Manhattan Deli, but I can tell you this, you won't leave hungry.  The sides are terrific and I wouldn't pass up the potato salad, even though I really do despise mayo. It has too much flavor to be missed. You can't go wrong with any choice, from their bagels with lox (oh.. so tasty) to their Ruben, stacked high with corn beef and sauerkraut.  The price is right for the amount of food, and I'd think they'd be losing a profit on some of the sizes of sandwiches I've seen...  But come, sit, sit, let me get you a little 'nosh."}
{"text":"Manhattan Deli Mentor Oh.  How can you not love a place that gives you a plate of house made pickles when you sit down. Yumm.  We have herd about the Manhattan Deli from numerous friends that live in Mentor, so when we were at Roma's last hair appointment, we thought we'd drop in since it is right down the street form L&G.  When you first walk in, you see the classic deli counter with meats and prepared foods for purchase to take home. Corn beef, pastrami, Latka, ext. along with baked good and pastries.  Our waitress, Rhonda was a very pleasant and polite mature woman who was very informative and insightful of the menu and specials. She also came to the table with the plate of delicious pickles, so in my book she's awesome!  Since this was our first time, naturally I had a little tasting of many things to truly give an accurate depiction of our dining experience.  For starters, we ordered a hummus plate, zucchini sticks, and a huge Greek salad.   The hummus was almost inedible, I don't know if it was the tahini or the citrus, but it did not taste anything like hummus, and it came with pre-packaged squares of pita that were so dry they were almost rubbery.   The zucchini stick were thick spears coated in a crunchy thin breading, these were probably some of the best I had ever had. I could eat these all day.   Roma and I shared the Greek salad; small baby olives, oil and vinegar, cucumbers, red onions, and a pile of feta. Pretty tasty!  For the main course we ordered Beef Shawarma, Falafel, and Latka.   The beef was thin strips, over cooked with old seasoning caked on each strip. Even with all the seasoning, they had very little if no flavor at all. Sitting on a pile of chopped iceberg lettuce with pickled beets and a side of tahini, Yikes that's alotta salad!  I was so looking forward to having the falafel, but man what a disappointment. Again, they were so dry, I almost had to dip them in my water just to ensure I could digest them. No flavor what so ever.  Then there was the Latka, another disappointment. Yes it was cooked fresh, and yes it looked delicious. But they were bitter and almost sour tasting. Even with some apples sauce, I couldn't eat them.  The saving grace for this experience was the desert. Roma had the lemon cheesecake, and I had the carrot cake. Both were absolutely delicious, but wouldn't you know, they weren't even made by the restaurant, they buy them from a local bakery. Surprise!  I guess this is all do to my willingness to be daring, and seeking some true ethnic cuisine. Everyone that suggested this place recommended the brisket, or the pastrami. I wish we would have stuck with that. I am not writing this place off yet. I will be going back and trying some of the more popular dishes. When I do I will hopefully be able to rewrite this review."}
{"text":"This will be an unusual review.  I haven't written one like it.  This has to do with the all you can eat fish places that we go to with regularity - Mentor Family Restaurant, Lakeshore Eatery, Mama Roberto's and Manhattan Deli.    The fish tastes great at all of these places and the price is not unreasonable.  All give a good portion on the first plate.  It's thereafter that we have an issue.  One piece every 20 minutes - some a little better, some a little worse.  Those that ask how many you want, take longer.    The management and owners need to take some things into consideration.  For our family, one person gets AYCE and the rest of us order from the menu.  That means 1-4 profit makers in our party of up to five.  We also come in at other times and spend money.    The slow down only serves to make our fish eater stubborn and he isn't afraid to tell the wait staff what he wants, especially when he isn't getting it.  I'm sure the wait staff hate AYCE fish.  Tonight we had a different tactic to the slow down.  They ran out of fish. I have very rarely been at a place that runs out of anything.  I am sure we are not the only ones disappointed in this situation.  Again, I ask that management take some time to rethink how we can make everyone happy.  Copying this to the other restaurants listed.  Don't think I am singling out any one place.  Now I am going in search of other places that do AYCE and hoping for the best."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Mentor -  Relaxed, friendly, huge sandwichs,  Great waitress -  Great Manager - Mark... All in all - I have been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  Not only was there a 6\" hair wound through both halves of my sandwich - the edge of the cheese had mold on it.  It looked like a sandwich that your blind, senile, 90 year old grandma would try to serve you.    Gross and will never be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great Father and Daughter dinner tonight. The matzo ball soup and corned beef was great and Emily had a really good salad. Have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing but the older ladies that are serving are quite mean ! The sandwiches are huge and had I of know this I would have split a sanswhiche with my husband ! I ordered the matzo ball soup as well so I was totally full after are meal ! I had no room for dessert !   One nice thing my husband like is they served beer and wine ! Nice added feature to a deli !   We also took home there home made grape butter. Sweet but good on toast !!!"}
{"text":"I found myself nearby and in need of lunch the other day, and Yelp efficiently found me Manhattan Deli.  They have a lot of options, and the employees seemed really friendly.  They made my order really quickly, which was definitely a plus.  I liked, but didn't love, my \"Vermont Gobbler\" sandwich.  The turkey was definitely good quality and the cream cheese was a nice touch, but the bread was a bit dry, and I wasn't a huge fan of their honey mustard.  It was HUGE, which justified the high price point, but I wish they offered a half sandwich option.  I will say the fries are excellent, especially if you ask for extra crispy.  This is the kind of review that's three stars because I didn't love the place, but would definitely give it another shot if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite breakfast and lunch restaurants. Mary who is a dear and a pleasure to be sat in her section , makes the whole experience enjoyable. I really enjoy the chopped liver as well as the matzo ball soup. It's nice to have a good deli in town"}
{"text":"I remember being a little girl walking into Manhattan Deli with my Mom and thinking, \"I wish I could live here.\"  As an adult, I drive 40 minutes to come enjoy the best deli around and still consider bringing a cot with me. Just noshing on pickles, matzo ball soup made from scratch and some damn good corned beef on rye. It's joy in om-nom-nom form.   Now, you need to trust me on this one. I've been coming here, eating like a horse and leaving happy since I was just a wee-mini-Cara. This is what a deli is supposed to be. A huge menu full of cold-cut favorites, sandwiches galore, middle-eastern tasties and homemade soups. And if you really want to know what wins my heart, they give you free pickles instead of bread before your meal. Love at first \"crunch\".  My wait staff experience at Manhattan Deli usually consists of two options: A mildly crabby older woman or a super friendly older guy--either way, I'm usually the youngest one around. Regardless, you'll always get great service and atmosphere at a low cost.   The prices are great, perfect lunch selections for any palette and the best deli fare around. Any way you slice it, Manhattan Deli is deli-licious!"}
{"text":"When I want fresh, crispy, nutritious food I come here. I enjoy what they prepare to my order. I like fried things crispy and they get it right each time. The salads are wonderful. The soup hot and freshly made. Their breads are artisan breads. The desserts are decadent and great to take home to share with someone special. If you like variety, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"When I hear the name Manhattan Deli, visions of real east coast deli come dancing through my head...but alas I was mistaken.  The food is not bad, nor can I go out on a limb and say it is good. It is average, and far below most NYC area delis.  I have eaten here more then once with the hope, that by some freak of nature the Deli fairy visited and improved the food. One can dream can't one? But, sigh,  unlike my optimistic dreams, I was left with only the dream. The dreams and the memories of real rye bread,  real corned beef and real NYC mustard. I dreamed for the Deli fairy doing its work, but the dream, just like those of my youth, it was just like the Tooth fairy, instead of a real good sandwich all i found was a lousy quarter under my pillow(actually it was dried up corned beef, on the floor under my table).  Why I didn't rate the restaurant a little higher, is for as the food is average, the service is usually far below."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite dinner. For lunch and dinner, it's your typical deli. Prices were right and the quality of the meats they order in are good. The inside is a bit dated. The service was as expected.  I ordered the potato pancakes stuffed with corned beef with a side of sour cream and applesauce. The potato pancakes were good. While the corned beef was lean, it was thin sliced deli meat, just a sandwich on the pancakes. It lacked the flavor I was expecting.   I think this would be a great place for breakfast. The dessert counter looked tasty and I'd come back for a cup of joe and a piece of cake! Looks like they'd put together a good catering deli tray as well. I'd recommend for those types of needs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best place to get matza ball soup and a reubin because it is so delicious and very nice people work there."}
{"text":"This place has a good homey feel and very good food. The Lebanese platter was really good and literally some of the best hummus I've ever had. She must add some hint of citrus or something. And the Baba was great too.   Got the Farmer in the Deli breakfast with Spicy Fries. Both amazing and their ranch is homemade and idk how they get it to be so good but it is. All in all just a great restaurant highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I got the Greek salad and Beef Shawarma Platter and both were fantastic! The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food. I will definitely be back and next time will definitely have to try the wine and the desserts!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch. Waitress was nice and I had the Pastrami Special Sandwich with Chive Cream Cheese. Some awesome onion rings as well. Big and crunchy and not greasy. Really entire this place."}
{"text":"Gotta try the latkes, they are the bomb and super filling. Besides that the typical club style sandwiches is whatchagonnaget."}
{"text":"I'm always disappointed in Manhattan Deli.  Maybe because I grew up in New York City and I know what a real Manhattan deli is like; this place ain't anything like that.  The food is always at best \"ok\" and I think it is overpriced for what you get.  Their cold cuts, which I think should be the strength of a deli, are just OK, and they don't have a lot of my favorites, like tongue."}
{"text":"Used to eat here every Friday for their fish.  Over the last year the fish servings keep getting smaller. The owners are super friendly but they need to improve the fish served."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good breakfast place. At first I wasn't really in to it but after going there a few times I've grown to really like their breakfast. They also have very good sandwiches. We have also had some really good service here. My girlfriend really likes their salads. Help support local businesses and give it a try I'm pretty sure you will like it."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I have a good meal! I have tried so many different things and I have never not liked anything. They have a wide range of choices and I don't think you could go wrong with any of them. Growing up in the area I never went there until an old friend took me a little over a year ago. I wish I knew about it earlier!!! If you are in the area it is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my family. It was St. Pat's and crowded and the waitress explained they didn't have time to make a salad. Only problem was, that's like the only healthy/vegetarian option they had available sans old hockey puck veggie burger. So I says to the waitress, not your fault I'll just let Tim and Mark know we're disappointed but we understand. So the waitress comes back later and asks my wife if she is just going to sit there and pout. WTF? My wife is always polite and never said a word. Then this mess of a waitress starts boxing the leftovers on top of the dirty plates she hadn't cleared. There was ketchup and food all over the bottom of the boxes. Rookie move. And there were other issues but I've piled on enough, you get the point. Come on Mark and Tim you work too hard to have some untrained waitress reflect on you guys like this. Please don't let this place go downhill."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as Slymans downtown Cleveland but also not as expensive and not as hard to get to. Plus, has more convenient (later) hours.  Good all around place to eat. Food is always consistent. Corned Beef routinely tends to be a bit dry for my taste.   Service is a 7- 8 out of 10. Deserts are to die 4.   Be sure to sign up with your birthday and anniversary for a free entree during  that month.  Wed. is ladies night so they eat for half price."}
{"text":"Always a great stop for breakfast and lunch, very clean and fast. Best sandwiches in Mentor. The Cleveland over Philly is the best. Great daily specials."}
{"text":"When the manager is there, this isn't bad.  When he isn't, it is awful.  The cooking isn't as good, the wait staff doesn't know what should be on the plate, orders are wrong, etc.  Last time, and I do mean the last time I will ever be there, they refused to substitute a salad for fries without a significant upcharge (the manager had done that for free weeks before), and tried to pass off a skimpy portion of corned beef with potato salad as the same amount as on the low carb plate I had a week earlier (1/2 lb. of corned beef with tomato slices).  As I said, I will never be there again."}
{"text":"Super disappointed tonight.  We ordered take out - three identical sandwiches, Midtown Ruebens.  Each one was totally different.  One was burnt, one undercooked, and one was missing almost all the meat.   We ordered the extra lean corned beef, as we have before.  This was very fatty and chewy and definitely not the quality that we've had in the past."}
{"text":"We love the Manhattan Deli. Best Matza ball soup and tabouli. Yum. They treat you like family. Love the bakery, too"}
{"text":"As my sister and I were driving around, ravaging to find a place to eat, with nothing looking/sounding good, she suggested Manhattan Deli...which was fine by me as it gives me another place to review. :)  My mom has been here on several occasions and has raved about it so we figured why not. Our stomachs had control at this point and honestly, soup on a cold day sounded very appealing.   And it's not often you see both owners walking around the place asking you how everything is and if you could use anything. Really nice people who worked there.  Our waitress was killer awesome. She took our order by memory and we both ordered the corn beef hash that came with a bread roll, salad and two eggs for $7. Cool.   When the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty. The portions were HUGE! My sister and I could've definitely split one. The bread was made by hand I'm 99% sure and was delightful. I ended up with a salad (which was also huge for a side salad...nothing fancy but fresh and homemade dressing) whereas the sis subbed in some clam chowder soup and insisted I try it. I don't like clams...well...not of that particular nature anyway. ;) It was really delicious and had great flavor and consistency. Not watered down or anything that would remotely resemble an instant soup.  My sister and I easily ended up getting containers for our food as there was no way we could eat it all. On the way out, I couldn't help but admire the cheesecake that called my name before me. It was their chocolate one (cannot remember the name of it as I was so mesmerized) and looked super rich but divine. I had to have it. So I got two. No, that wasn't my inner fat-kid talking...I bought one for my parents to split ya weirdos. The lady at the counter was super nice and boxed up the slices in a safe-transport container...which my car appreciated.  Definitely will be back to try other things. Really enjoyed it and their coffee kicks ass too. Very good, even black, with hints of chocolate in that too. Loved it! GO! Do it now! :D"}
