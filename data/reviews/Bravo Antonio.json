{"text":"Excellent Italian food!  I have now had breakfast, lunch and dinner here.  For t Mill has needed an authentic Italian restaurant for a long time!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food.  The pasta is made fresh and so are the sauces and soups.  One of the better Italian restaurants in the Charlotte metro area.  Portion sizes are good and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We had come to the restaurant because of the good reviews we had read. Unfortunately, somebody must have been off or the restaurant was having an extremely bad night the evening we decided to eat at the estabilishment. 
I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana sub, which was nothing more than a big hunk of chicken on a over toasted sub roll. This is an open face sandwich as well. My wife had Pasta Ala Antonio, which was rose sauce with garlic and mushrooms over angel hair pasta. Well to be honest, there was nothing pink about it. It was like marinara. And the taste was no different than a chef boy ardee dish. My 2 year old had grilled cheese with french fries. The fries were so hot and oily and not done. Terrible food. The sub came with the same oily, severely undercooked fries and the pasta with a salad. The drinks were from a 12 pack of sodas as you would purchase from the local grocery store. And they only had one diet coke left at 7 pm.  No refills ever offered, even on unsweet tea.
Atmosphere is cozy with 7 or so tables. Old tables that have paper folded under the legs to keep from tilting. I had such high hopes for this cozy place. The waitress asked what was wrong and I happily told her. She too, agreed with me on the under cooked fries and the piece of oily bread that came with the pasta. She apologized saying the chef was in a hurry and had a big party before we got there. (a table of 7 or 8 that left  about 15 minutes after we were there) There was only one other table of 2 that was there.  I was also told by the waitress that the delivery truck had also turned over that day as well....
I suspect if you are the only table there, it may be ok. If there are other diners, not so much. Im terribly disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast place, and boy, did Ft. Mill need one!  Excellent grits, really good fresh made Italian sausage, and I can't say enough good things about the vegetable fritata or the pancakes.  We love the staff, too; Paula always has a smile and she likes to remember your name.  I wish the coffee were a little less bitter, but otherwise, I am a fan."}
