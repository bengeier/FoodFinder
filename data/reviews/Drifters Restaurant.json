{"text":"I guess you could say we drifted into this place on a cold day.   The Boss and I were looking for a different meal one day and decided to venture on route 73 to find an open place for a decent meal. When he suggested a truck stop I kind of just laughed it off. But then again growing up in 3 provinces it dawned on me that maybe he was right.   So we ended up here at a Calgary Mega truck stop and seated in a booth inside Drifters Restaurant. I liked the interior and the feel of the place is like you've just rolled into Calgs from a road trip. There was others dining inside, but just enough. The waitress was very friendly, and would often converse with us. I ordered the veal cutlet, and mashed potatoes and the boss ordered a hamburger with fries.   The food was tasty, a bit better then the average. Our plates were completely finished. The beer was very cheap, so we had a few. Then I had lemon meringue pie for dessert. The whole experience brought back memories of when I was a waitress at a smaller truck-stop so all the nostalgia was added to every bite. Especially when one of the waitresses sat a booth filling up the sugar bowls."}

{"text":"went to Drifters again, and gotta update my review to 5 Stars. it's the perfect place. it's not like the food is any gourmet foodie stuff, but it's still good food. The whole Drifters experience is what makes it 5 stars. the service is excellent - our waitress was busy clearing up with customers so the cook came to take our drink orders and bring them to us - so nice! prices are great, and there's lots of room so if you want to take a bit of extra time to do the crossword in the newspaper, the waitress doesn't mind, and she'll keep your coffee filled for you, too!  (also, check out the attached gas station. one of the best gas stations i've ever seen! so many books on CD, to help the truckers stay awake!) (oh. and I was talking to a trucker who said he prefers Drifters over the other truck stops because there aren't any hookers that come knocking on the truck doors - which I guess could either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you want to do after you eat.)"}
