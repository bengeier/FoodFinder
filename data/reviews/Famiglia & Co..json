{"text":"The food was very good. I had the veal scallopini with lobster in a cream sauce. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed our food.   The service really stood out. Very friendly servers, always around when we needed them. We were served by several people who brought us water, fresh pepper etc.  I've had better food and possibly better service, but this was a very good combination of the two.   Would go there again."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm confused. The sushi was A-1, delicious, and pricey ($25.00 for an assortment plate). The pizza was quite nice but the linguini with clam sauce was not impressive, at this price don't you think that they wouldn't serve the unopened clams that circle the bowl, 1/3 of them were not edible. Astonishing.  We finished off with the Tiramisu that was very good, but at $7.00 for a scoop? And literally, it appeared they use an ice-cream scooper. Just this side of skimpy for the price.  Even with their faults, it would have been more acceptable if the waiter had been just a little more affable, maybe they were short-staffed, maybe that's how it works over there, he was often difficult to get a hold of.  The fact that it's a byow establishment usually makes it all the more appealing, but I have an itch that there is better out there."}
{"text":"Very frustrated with my visit to this restaurant last night. Even though the food and our waitress Amanda were absolutely amazing, I had a horrible experience with a man, whom I assume to be the manager of the restaurant. When I called to reserve I was informed by this man that there was only room for a 5:30 reservation, I said that was great and he mentioned that we would have to be out by 7:30, I thought it was unprofessional for him to mention this, but I understand how restaurant seatings work. Let me mention that this was a staff dinner and that 4 people of the group finished work at 6, but they would have plenty of time to eat between 6 and 7:30 and I did not see this as an issue. Around 6 pm most of the people from the group were seated and had already placed their order, with 4 people still missing the manager came to my table to ask if he could take the table away. I thought this was extremely rude, but I am not one to cause a scene so I told him that more people were coming, but if he needed to take the table away he could and he said no and walked away. I also received a text message from coworkers telling me that they were finishing work late and would be there around 6:30. The rest of us started eating without them, two coworkers showed up at 6:30 and there were still two people missing. At this point the man comes back and starts picking up the plates from the two empty seats and says \"I don't think your friends are coming\", the two people walked in as this was happening so he reset the plates, but this was the most unprofessional and rude thing I have ever experienced at a restaurant. We were a group of young adults and I believe he would have never acted the way he had, had we been older. No matter our age, we are paying customers and his behaviour was unacceptable. I hope to find out who this man is and get an apology for his behaviour."}
{"text":"Regardless of the quality of the food, which is a hit and miss, the service is always a miss. You always have to wait too long for your meal and the servers are often unprofessional as they are not attentive, not very responsive and their manner is too casual."}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times and it's always been quite good.  We were four and had the following:  Arugula salad - GOOD - good ole salad with dressing Pizza - VERYGOOD - tasted excellent and the crust was fantastic Penne with meat sauce - GOOD - Deep fried meat ball - GOOD Giant shrimp - EXCELLENT - the balsamic really leaves a wonderful taste  I think one of my biggest beefs is with the price however it is comparable to the same thing in other places, 9$ for half a bag of arugula and cheese shavings is the norm (I've seen 9-14$) but it still hurts a bit.  The great thing about this place is that it is a bring your own wine so you can drink what your palate loves!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. It used to be a old Dunkin donuts.  Came to eat here once with a group of friends it was your typical Italian food nothing crazy nothing terrible. Would I travel back down to the west island to eat here ? No   Would I recommend this spot.. not really because nothing really stood out in my eyes. We did have a nice waitress which always makes dinner better."}
{"text":"Nice little bring your own wine. This location has had restaurants come and go there. None ever seem to last. Famiglia has been around for a little while now and people seem to enjoy it. I've been a couple of times, my favourite is the chef's special pasta. Its tortellini in a rose sauce with speck, i get it every time."}
{"text":"The most authentic italian cuisine you can find. It's like taking a trip down memory lane."}
{"text":"It's pricier for the quality I ordered I ordered the fish of the day (Mahi Mahi, 28$) it was undercooked and subpar. I had better expectations.  I've also had the pizza and the crust is like their bread which is stellar but the cheese is also subpar.  Bring your own wine is a positive part but I won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"5 ieme visite et cette fois avec un groupe de 8 collègues de bureau.  Réservation faite en ligne et la confirmation fut faite. J'ai fait une erreur en oubliant une personne sur le nombre de convives et le serveur a été très professionnel et à modifié la table sans me faire sentir mal.  Plusieurs entrées et plats principaux ont été commandés et tous ont été ravis de leurs choix.  Boulettes ,calamars et salade César, tout était bon. Ensuite les pizza, gnocchis maison aux patates douces et linguinis aux fruits de mer furent aussi parfait. Le cafe aussi est excellent.  Le tiramisu était maison. L'excellent service d'Eric a fait que notre soirée fut mémorable.  Apportez votre vin Je suis un régulier :-)"}
{"text":"Comfortable ambience. Great sushi. Service can be very slow - if you are not in a hurry try this place out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cozy bring your own wine Italian restaurant with good food, look no further. Giovanni and his crew offer excellent service and the kitchen is always spot on."}
{"text":"I was initially put off by the fact that we made reservations, came on time, but came in to see that there was no spot reserved for us and they had opted to give away our tables. Still, I didn't want that even to ruin my meal. I don't usually opt for pasta dishes but, when it's promised to be quality homemade dishes, I'll give it a go. I wanted to try the best pasta dish they could boast and chose, upon recommendation, the sweet potato gnocchi. It did not disappoint. The gnocchi piece were the size of meatballs and the mushroom sauce was delicious. It was a bit on the pricey side, as BYOW's tend to be (since you've already forgotten how much you've spent on wine). In any case, I'd rather spend $16 on a good homemade pasta than $13 on a crappy, out of the box pasta. The ambiance leans to the modern side and is very reminiscent of Au Vieux Four Manago. The sushi is a bit out of place but I've heard good things about it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant really disappointed me. First of all, the smell when walking in the restaurant is disgusting. It must be the cheese but it smells like pure vomit. Not very appetizing. The food is very disappointing as well. Took grilled octopus which was cut in a strange way. Nothing special. I took the gnocchi with the mushrooms and was pretty good however my husband took pasta with clams in white wine sauce. The plate was so basic, a child could have cooked something better. If you feel like Italian and are in the West Island, Le Vieux Four Manago is a much better option & its on the same street."}
