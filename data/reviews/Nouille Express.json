{"text":"They have the best Beef Chow Mein in Montreal. It's near Concordia University. If ever I feel like having Chow Mein Noodles, that's the place I rather be!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite chinese food place in Montreal. The portions are humungous and the price very reasonable.  I am a semi-regular customer. #28 - Chicken (chow mein) is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"**i tried the afternoon special meal A. for $10, it consisted of fried noodles w/ pieces of chicken/beef + assorted vegetables. it also came with a small soup, and 1 imperial roll.**

the portion was generous given the price so if you aren't picky and just want to fill your stomach, you do get a good bang for ur buck. personally, the food was too greasy/oily/bland, so i wouldn't recommend  based on what i got, but it's worth trying out the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Bring Cash!! they only accept cash 
Be very careful what you choose, if you're completely new to the place make sure to read reviews and be informed of what exactly you're ordering! I made the mistake of choosing something that looked appetizing on the menu but ended up being the most bland thing I ever had, service is decent and -13% off for students. I personally recommend General Tao chicken and jumbo peanut saut√©ed shrimp ! the soups are decent as well but otherwise I find it generic and bland"}
{"text":"I've been going here since the early 2000s. I've ordered the #32 'House Canto style noodles' every single time and liked it...and every single time I've forgotten cash! 'Cash Only' it says, and the owner tells me he doesn't want to raise the prices by 15% to use the debit system. I got news for ya, I'm a chef and the food on the plate was about 15% of the $10 charge! Either get interac and stop trying to swindle your customers with the self owned $2 ATM conveniently located near the entrance or I will find another cheap noodle house who will take my bank card. The End."}
{"text":"Best general Tao chicken & best peanut butter dumplings I've ever had.

It's over 13 years I go there, and they are consistently amazing.

Very reasonable prices, and a Concordia University monument. It's conveniently located next to Guy metro, so easy to get to.

Once again, amazing food, great price. Would highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese restaurant next to the Concordia University.

The good: Food is terrific! Prices are good. Menu contains Chinese writings. Service is usually good and friendly. Big plates with a lot of food.

The bad: Seatings and tables are old and cheap. Place is small. Can be very noisy (even when restaurant is not full). Employees have their own table in the restaurant and it is always fully occupied (for some reason, that bothered me). Getting there in winter can be dangerous (slippery cement steps). 

The verdict: If you can ignore the cheap look and seatings of the place, you can enjoy quite a very good meal for a nice average price. Best General Tao I had so far."}
{"text":"Ate there once.  Will not repeat. 
Cheap prices, but also verrry cheap quality food.  
Many better quality food options in the area for the same price-point."}
{"text":"Horrible presentation. Horrible food quality. Very unhealthy. Made me despise asian food and a disgrace to the Asia continent. Made me and all of my employees puke. This should be enough for you not to take the risk, or for them to elevate their food quality. Wondering what the kitchen looks behind the scenes..... #stayaway"}
{"text":"When ever I visit Montreal I go here. Good menu options. And good cheap food. Only accept cash."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for a high quality meal then there might be better options near the concordia area that is more authentic. However, I must say the dishes here are extremely cheap and portions are VERY large (I get takeout and it usually lasts me two meals). Perfect for students on a budget. My go-tos are usually the Yangzhou fried rice or the \"yu xiang\" eggplants haha

TIP: MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH, they don't accept anything else!"}
{"text":"Chances upon this place after heading to the grocery store right next door. Just a heads up - I'm from a Chinese family so that might bias my review of this place.

The ambience is okay. I imagine this place to be more so a delivery joint than an actual sit in and eat. Overall, the food is okay. I'd imagine this is great for hungover college students. The portions are huge and the food is very cheap.

We got a Shanghainese noodle soup, which tasted more like a strange, sweeter version of pho. The shrimp was large and plentiful though, but the bbq pork was tough to chew.

There was also a large rice bowl of egg and beef. The quality of rice is decent, and the beef was tender in accordance to the standard way this dish is typically made. The taste could have been stronger though.

The water did taste a bit strange. Overall, come here for fast and cheap eats. If you're a tourist or looking for an actual sit down, find a different place."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a friend during an afternoon and the food was quite good and affordable. Service was quick and the waitor very polite and efficient. You will find there what you find in most Chinese restautants such as rice, noodles, shrimp, beef and chicken, but there are also several vegetarian options on the menu. I recommend the tofu general tao which was pretty cheap and quite good."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in the heart of Sir George Williams campus with quick service and yummy food. I took only a soup and the waitress looked disappointed, but I'll come back because the prices are friendly, the atmosphere is worth it and it's a perfect lunch solution between classes ! :)"}
{"text":"This particular area of downtown is loaded with quality, affordable Chinese restaurants so you have to be good to make it here.  Nouilles Express is a no frills, low-cost restaurant serving up mighty tasty food.  It's quickly becoming my go to Chinese take out spot.

They do all the dishes you'd expect from any Chinese restaurant.  I'm a fan of their hot and sour soup as well as the General Tao's chicken.  Portions are huge so what you can't finish you can easily reheat the next day.

The restaurant is cash only so come prepared.  In case you forget there is an atm there so you can withdraw some.  I can't comment on the actual service in the restaurant because I only ever get take out here though they are quick at preparing take out orders."}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw the prices and the fact they have a nice selection of vegetarian options I said lets do it.
I ordered the General Tao Tofu, although people I saw a good review on it here, personally I was disappointed. The Tofu was over fried and socked with oil, pretty much a hard on the out side oil sponge. The sauce itself was nice. I had the combo with the spicy soup (the other soup is with chicken) which was full of cornflour yet with some rice in it it was not bad. If you are vegetarian and order the combo make sure the egg roll is also vegetarian ! 

Bottom line: Big Portion, very cheap price (and 13% off for students!) but not an amazing food. Maybe I will try it again maybe not (probably not)"}
{"text":"Home of the de facto best GT in the downtown core.*

Cash only. Why? SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE https://squareup.com/ca/


*Wok Cafe really has the best overall GT if like, you entered all the Chinese places in the neighbourhood into a GT cook off and everyone had like, just, all day to prepare the single best GT dish of their lives. Except in the regular world where people go and eat GT everyday unannounced like, just, to feed themselves, Wok Cafe has plain ol' lost the ability to consistently prepare a good plate of GT, mostly on account of obviously having different people prepare their unique flavour of GT sauce every day with varying degrees of skill and success. I imagine at one time there was just one cook responsible for GT sauce making at Wok Cafe -- he was either the originator of the recipe or a disciple of whoever came up with it --and life was good. Then I guess he left or whathaveyou and all the other cooks figured \"How hard can it be?\" Pretty hard it turns out. At Nouille Express, the sauce doesn't have that level of complexity, but whoever is working the kitchen on any given day can produce a hot mountain of always crispy, well battered morsels of chicken covered in gooey sweet orange GT sauce that's maybe second fiddle at the GT cook off but wins my heart any other day of the week because it never disappoints. All I eat is GT so who knows about anything else on the menu. Seriously, cash only?"}
