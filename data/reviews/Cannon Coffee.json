{"text":"Brookline is cool.  Cannon Coffee is one of the reasons why Brookline is cool.  Stop in, grab a coffee or whatever, chat with the other customers, listen to music.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Cannon Coffee is such a cute little place, the coffee is great, the food is wonderful. The staff is polite and friendly. They have an open mic night on Wednesday's and it's safe and appropriate enough for me to bring my kid. I really appreciate a place like this in Brookline. Everyone knows each other, it's not corporate and the A@%holes go to Starbucks. Great job Cannon!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, comfortable chairs, tables if you need to work, plenty of inexpensive parking on Brookline Blvd.  Now if they'd only open a branch in Dormont!"}
{"text":"Super adorable coffee shop with a great back porch for outdoor seating on nice evenings.  Love it."}
{"text":"newly remodeled...expanded food menu...indoor/outdoor seating...great coffee, great people, great for the community"}
{"text":"This place is great. I was walking with my dog on a really hot day, and the kind folks at Cannon Coffee let me bring my dog in and gave him a cup of water. I really appreciated that. The iced coffee is mighty delicious."}
{"text":"really glad an independent coffee shop is doing well in brookline, but customer service isn't always good.  i'm a local and used to frequent it a lot and was never really treated warmly by the staff despite coming in a lot.  oh well!"}
{"text":"Cool local coffee shop with nice food offerings and good drinks. It's easy to tell that it is operated by people who care about doing great work and are always looking for ways to improve."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. The coffee is absolutely amazing and so are their yummy sandwiches. I was there when Nate and Ben first opened the shop back in Feb. 2010. This place has become my home away from home. All of the baristas there are very friendly and they are warm and sociable. Sadly, I had moved very far away but whenever I am in town this is one of the places that I must stop at because they are all like family."}
{"text":"In a world full of Starbucks, this place is a breath of fresh air.  An independent coffee shop run by young people.  They do art shows, yoga, and poetry nights to name a few things.  Most importantly; the coffee is delicious!"}
{"text":"In a long career of coffee shops across the United States, this is probably the most friendly and laid back place I have yet to encounter.

The owners have excellent taste -- both in drinks and in food -- and everything appears to be made on-site or locally sourced; even their hand soap is a nice organic brand, not that awful antibiotic-laced gunk most places use.

The owners are very friendly and community-oriented; their attitudes reflect their kindness, and their prices reflect a desire to purvey fine fare, not to wring their customers' wallets.

It's an excellent communal hub; a good place to spend some hours reading, working, or chatting; or simply a great place to order some take-out, and a quick hot drink -- no matter what you do, or how much or little you spend, you can expect only the finest treatment from their staff, who seem to take service very seriously and genuinely care about providing a memorably pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I like this place a bunch. My husband and I go here for open mic from time to time. Everyone i really friendly and the coffee and food is excellent.Laid back eclectic style with creative people everywhere you turn.just what you expect of a good coffeehouse  We are going tonight~"}
{"text":"These days it looks like Brookline Boulevard is making a comeback.  With Las Palmas ethnic grocery store, Scoops ice cream shop, and a new pretzel shop in the works, Brookline seems alive again and right in the middle of this is Cannon Coffee.  

Cannon has a very laid back atmosphere (sorta like a living room) and they serve excellent coffee.  The owner is very friendly and has no problem chatting with his customers.  Also, they're committed to serving actual coffee without the moca-machi-latte-frappe concoctions that seems to be so prevalent everywhere else.  Great people, great atmosphere, great coffee, check it out."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop in Brookline that is actually owned by a friend of mine named Nathan. I actually have never been there during the day (which I would like to do sometime soon), but I've been there for the open mic night on Wednesdays- which is amazing! People from all over the neighborhood come (BYOB) and play what they've got with smiles and fun and no judgements. The talent was wide ranging, but fun is had by all because everyone is so inviting and accepting. It's really nice to come into an intimate neighborhood place as an outsider and feel welcomed. My friend who I went with actually was inspired to get up and play something on her violin, and they loved it. Furthermore, a large part of the group walk over to the Brookline pub afterwards to grab beers with each other every week- which I partook in and had a blast. I can't wait to go back again, and maybe this time I'll go up and sing something (..... not really)!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at Cannon Coffee for a while when I was taking the bus to work.  They open conveniently for commuters at 6:30am, and offer the same selections for coffee that you'd find at Starbucks. (coffee, expresso drinks, tea)  

They do have, what my husband refers to as 'foo foo coffee drinks' but less of a selection than your average starbucks, but still good and Local!

But the best thing about Cannon Coffee is the atmosphere.  This is an old school coffee house with games and books for patrons to use, a piano in the corner and a great eclectic vibe.  They work hard at being part of the community, with open mic nights and concerts offered on various nights too.

So, if you're in Brookline for whatever reason, stop in and get a coffee at Cannon Coffee."}
{"text":"Great artsy type independent coffee house. Great coffee (commonwealth brand, local), great atmosphere and a good place to sit and read the news, browse the web on their free wifi, and people watch. The owners will serve you your drink and bend your ear. Terrific people. Great new addition to Brookline and the boulevard."}
{"text":"Super solid coffee drinks, great service, never had their food, they have that Pellegrino lemon and orange soda in their case if you're feeling dehydrated (I see that a lot in Pittsburgh is that like a thing?)  

I've gotten a super fantastic double cappuccino and an iced dirty chai.  They were both very good and baristas making them were super friendly and all hip and stuff.  

The atmosphere looks extremely comfortable.  Bookshelves and red velour chair(s), hardwood floors, tasteful art, a fish tank (that was a fishtank right?  I might be making that up.)  All combined and with the addition of the heavenly aroma of good coffee, it's definitely a place in which I would \"hang\" if I was a cool person that did that but I can't study in coffee shops cause I get too distracted watching other people and being more interested in what they're doing instead of my stupid whatever I'm reading.

The point is, everyone looked very happy and comfy and this is a place to go for great coffee.  So...if this is your neighborhood, you're very lucky."}
{"text":"Good cappuccino. They brew Commonplace coffee. I liked the bird in the cage. Overall nice place."}
{"text":"Now that Sugar Cafe closed (equaldistant from our home), we're left with only one great coffee shop in walking distance....  that would be Cannon Coffee.

Reasonable prices, decent brew, good small eats, and an awesome aura (complete with a back deck, local artisan sales, and open mic nights) make this the complete neighborhood coffee shop package.

Everyone is always nice and you get to see a great representation of the diverse neighborhood that is Brookline."}
{"text":"Note : it's now called \"Cafe Noir\"  
Nathan Mallory, original owner has sold the shop to a Lebanese man...not sure if they plan to radically change it or not...I have noticed that the flourescent overhead lights are always on...not a nice atmosphere for a coffee shop experience .  better than no coffee joint , I guess."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at Cannon Coffee today. Their iced mocha is very on par with any other mocha I've had in the city's Coffee Scene. I saw a food menu with some sandwiches on it that sounded very delicious, I will definitely come back to try those. 

They play WYEP throughout the place, which I like, and they also have a back porch, that might have a white dog running around in it or not.  Cannon fits along perfectly with all the other places on Brookline Blvd.

I really like Cannon Coffee and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I had a really great caramel cappuccino made with almond milk once. But the next two times I went in there they didn't have almond milk and the drinks just didn't taste that good (inconsistency bothers me). I don't think it was the fact they used dairy instead of almond milk that it tasted bad. The last two times I went they tasted really bitter and chemically, probably from the caramel syrup.

Seeing as I love local establishments, I will be giving Cannon Coffee another shot. But I think I'll stick with coffee instead of a flavored drink."}
{"text":"This coffee shop, nicely located on the main drag, was a delightful find. The ice coffee was delicious and paired nicely with the scone I had. Scone had a very unique flavor and I totally dug it! 

Wifi was speedy, service was friendly. Overall it was a nice find! Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I am sitting at Cannon right now with my dog and a really good wifi connection. The back deck is nice, they gave him water, and the coffee is good. Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Great small business cafe!
Met my girlfriend here for a coffee on a weekday afternoon.  They have a small menu of hot and cold drinks.  I ordered a latte which was made perfectly.  The expression they used was smooth and rich.  They have a few food items too but didn't try any this time.  
Definitely recommend for a great coffee drink and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cannon Coffee is the first part of a new non-profit where the owner intends to set up coffee shops in various neighborhoods of Pittsburgh and reinvest the earnings in the community. The next installments will likely be in Sheraden and Beechview.

As to the shop itself, the prices are decent, the coffee is good, and the baristas are extremely friendly. It's an independent coffee shop that provides all of the benefits you would expect an independent shop to provide(Many in Pittsburgh are guilty of not fulfilling their role!). The decor is fun, old looking mix-and-match chairs and tables. A patio for smokers and non-smokers to share the fresh air. A piano that can be played, usually some other instruments hanging about as well.

Every Wednesday night they have an open mic at 8."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a year. Always quiet,  free wifi, and great coffee. The patrons and staff are cool, as well.

They hold an open mic on Wednesday evenings (never have attended due to another standing gig I have), but I've heard good things. Also, local artists work on display and available for purchase.

The only downside... The wait for food is pretty long. Two grilled cheese sandwiches took almost 30 minutes! 

If you're in the area, it's worth making this your stop for a caffeine fix..."}
{"text":"I had an impromptu meeting to conduct and was really craving a good pretzel from Vinnie's. When I parked, I noticed this little café and figured it would work out as the perfect location for the meeting. I told my associates to order me a chamomile tea and that I would return with sustenance.

When I arrived with the pretzels, the three of us sat at some comfy chairs. It is rather tchotchke and Bohemian in a sparse way in the interior. I enjoyed my tea. I was told the iced coffee was good."}
{"text":"This place clearly deserves 5 stars. The coffee was excellent and they also have wifi however, you will need to ask for a password. A couple of regulars came in after us and they were super sweet. My boyfriend and I will defiantly make a return trip!

On the return trip we had an excellent conversation with the owner about some new ideas he had to bring in more business. One of them being a Sunday brunch which sounded amazing! Defiantly hit up this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when doing a little bit of neighborhood research upon finding out that I would be spending a lot of time in Brookline.  This section of Pittsburgh has a lot of character, and it turns out, a lot of interesting characters as well.  My first visit was on a Wednesday night after a long meeting, and I was needing something special to get me going.  A latte was just what the doctor ordered, and this cute little coffee shop on the Boulevard that looked so inviting and interesting on my Googles looked even more inviting in person.  I am so glad I stopped in, because I not only had a great latte, but I ended up spending a couple of hours enjoying local poets, musicians, comedians, and other entertainers bring forth a truly unique evening that I will never forget.

One late morning, I found myself in the same neighborhood feeling a little bit hungry and I remembered the hand-drawn signs at Cannon Coffee describing their wraps and paninis, so I swooped into a parking space and decided to give them a try.  The thoroughly tatooed and delightfully engaging woman working the counter by herself quickly whipped up a delicious pulled pork panini and a perfect latte for me.  To think that I usually ended up in a Wendy's in similar circumstances left me feeling thankful for that urge to try something different and put my hard-earned cash into the hands of a local-type establishment.  I will definitely be visiting this place again soon, and I would encourage anyone who is tired of the usual trite and cliche entertainment offered in most Pittsburgh establishments to check out the Wednesday open mic night at Cannon, because chances are, you will never see this kind of unique local color and artistry anywhere else."}
{"text":"I couldn't ask for a better local coffee shop.  The service is outstanding, my dogs are allowed in, there's a patio out back, they serve good food as well as delicious coffee-friendly confections, and everyone is consistently nice. I've not yet been to an open mic but I love that they hold them, plus are an active part of the community.  Everything a local coffee should be!"}
{"text":"Good food, good coffee, nice staff. A great neighborhood coffee spot. Last time I had lunch (veggie grilled panini). Top notch! I also met the potter who makes their mugs last time I was in. I love that Cannon Coffee supports a local artists (mugs are for sale in the shop!)
All around great."}
{"text":"Something was slightly \"off\" with the space-time continuum today, as I found myself in a Pittsburgh from an alternate reality, one in which the hipsters and yuppies conquered Brookline rather than Lawrenceville; a world...I never made! GASP!

I rectified the paradox by besting a certain neo-beatnik supervillian who possessed superhuman intelligence, advanced weaponry, and fortunately a glass jaw and poor aim, seemingly setting everything straight in the process. Although, Cannon Coffee remains as a memento of this adventure. The displaced, futuristic couple who ended up here as a result of my antagonist's foiled scheme had no way back to their homeworld. 

I read too many comic books. 

And you can read them, in here. Get them from Geekadrome up the street. 

Hey, at least it's not another pizza parlor or bar. The Boulevard has enough of those. 

I kept meaning to stop in for the past year and procrastinated so much, a Texan of all people got the worm before I did. Crud! This is MY neighborhood!!! Grrrr...

Takeout appears to be my specialty as of late, so I call, ask politely, the nice, schoolmarmish gal on the phone says \"no problem\" and there I found myself in this transplanted, wonderfully retro-fitted relic of a place.

Now I have another reason to wish my maternal grandmother was still alive. She'd be in here everyday, reading her tabloids and making sure everyone knew all there was to know about her. 

I walk in and see all manner of antiques, including an old cash register (I always wanted one as a kid. No shit.) as well as friendly, bookish people sitting in the kind of stately, cozy chairs you might find in Bruce Wayne's study. If only these folks would besiege Brookline Pub or Gordon's. Hey, I'll lead the charge. 

\"Your panini is ready,\" I am told by server who failed to use the proper singular \"panino.\" 

 \"You're Darren, right?\"

\"Yes I am.\" 

After chatting for a few minutes with the woman who waited on me , I walk out with a grilled-zucchini panino, a small, perfectly crispy, tart, juicy apple, and a large, artfully decorated sheetcake brownie.

I get my lunch into Lawrenceville (I felt I had just left there) and gobble it up. Yes, I went veggie again, and I am glad because this may have been the very best vegetarian sandwich I've ever had. Zucchini, onions, tomato, spinach, Muenster (the goth metal cheese), and aioli (aw hellyeah!) colluded with that most artisinal bread in a drastic attempt to make me swear off meat for good.

Well, I had steak for dinner this evening, so they failed in that regard. Nonetheless, my palate is still having fantasies about that panino. I'm trying the Cuban next time. 

Now onto dessert. Again, I couldn't figure out if what I was eating was a brownie or a slice of sheetcake done up by a cake decorator gone mad, but this harlot of cocoa and fudge had such a time tossing my  taste buds into a tizzy that I was almost late for work!  I couldn't wolf it down. I had to savor it. Damn you and your wiles, pastry!

I know I like to goof on places such as these, but the people running Cannon Coffee really seem to want to be a part of Brookline and were gracious that I gave them my business. They can stay as far as I am concerned. 

And I don't even drink coffee. Imagine that."}
{"text":"Closed during hours it says it is opened is a big no-NO in my book. I walked in, guy said it was closed and then he pulled out his guitar and started strumming it."}
{"text":"Why five stars? Anyone who can start a coffeehouse with a world full of Starbucks and Caribou's gets a pat on the back from me. The only strike against Cannon is that they close early but it's not that big a deal with me to take a star away. I ordered an iced coffee for 2 bucks, it was every bit as good as Starbucks' iced brew and the best part, the \"plastic\" cup my beverage came in was made from plant products. So it will  rot in the ground. I love supporting locally own businesses, it's good for the community and the economy. It's got a Beehive feel without the freaks. You can borrow a book from the bookshelf, listen to good music when they have open mic night or just go in with an iPhone like I did and chill. I got to talking to the owner and his partner, he has some great ideas, I wish him luck and hope it comes to fruition. Locals go behind the counter and help themselves and leave the money on the counter. There is a deck behind the counter for smokers or if you just want to sit outside. I like this place and can see myself becoming a regular. Hey Nate good luck and save me a comfy chair!"}
{"text":"People looking to open up a coffee shop in Pittsburgh have it made!  Want a homey feel?  Buy a house and convert it into a business!  Want a beautiful molded ceiling?  Already there!  Want character? It's built in.

Get the point?  This place has history and I love it!  Lots of books line the walls, but little trinkets decorate the walls and ample seating, including comfy chairs, make it a prime spot for work or a casual meet up.  They also have a killer outdoor patio that actually offers power for your laptop too, which is a total plus if you want to hang in the pretty space.

They have all the normal coffee, tea and soda offerings (yay for Italian soda!). I went with an iced vanilla latte and it was perfect.  The dude who seemed to be the owner was incredible friendly and even had his fluffy friendly dog with him.  If you're looking for a furry friend to break up the work day, this doggie is looking for attention!  

The food they were making for breakfast and lunch smelled awesome, so I'm looking forward to stopping back for some bites."}
{"text":"Over the past few months, I've spent a good portion of my life at this establishment, and with good reason.  The owners have created a  beautiful and wonderful gem on the Boulevard.  It's fun, welcoming, warm, and... of course most importantly...  the coffee is great.   

I have always been pleased with the quality of their product  - both edible and drinkable! Their Turkey Florentine and Chicken Salad Sandwiches are phenomenal. Their fresh soups are FANTASTIC and they strive to use locally produced products. And how can I not compliment the rest of the staff? The quality of service that I have received from all of the Baristas is top notch. They have great personalities and never miss a beat. Just a really excellent place all around. You can tell these are people who are passionate about their business, care about their customers, and truly enjoy what they do. Their knowledge and commitment to excellence would be hard to match. 

On top of all this, they are also focused on giving back to the community by holding community sponsored events in their space: Open Mic Nights, Meetings for various community groups (churches, schools, business owners, writers, knit/crochet groups, book clubs),  and a night of Cookies and Stories with Santa. They even held a wonderful class about the finer points of Coffee. :) 

Not interested in those group aspect sort of  things? Not to worry -- this is a great place to curl up with a book on one of their comfy chairs, they even have a great selection right there if you happen to have forgotten one. There's a wonderful chess board, and even some other board games should the mood strike you. Or just bring a friend, sit in the corner, listen to the great music they play while you relax, chat and catch up. 

Cannon Coffee is quite stuck with this loyal and very happy customer for a long time!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming !!!  Nate the owner always has an interesting update on events in the neighborhood ! Oh and great coffee/teas  :)"}
