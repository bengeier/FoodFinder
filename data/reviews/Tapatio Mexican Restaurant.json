{"text":"Food was decent but service was terrible. From the time we walked in the door service was pitiful. The hostess threw menus on the table w/ out saying a word & walked away. Server had to be asked for refills & the tortilla chips we were given were burnt & we had to ask to get decent ones. Took forever to get our food. I ordered a large meal that was fairly expensive & came w/ 3 tiny tortilla shells. When I asked for a few more they charged me for them!  The server never came back to ask about refills or if the food was okay.  On top of it all the place was freezing cold. We had to eat w/ our coats on. We used to like going here but it'll be our last visit. Very poor experience- over priced, terrible service & only average food."}
{"text":"Service was meh... food was meh... likely I'll go here by choice?  None. 

My family was served salsa that was bubbling... like fermentation in prison wine might.  Told the waiter but I don't think he understood it was rancid.  We avoided the salsa altogether after that.  And chips with salsa is half the reason we go to Mexican joints.  

Needs a cleanse and maybe a little remodel..."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, Madison is, how we say, limited in dining options for the most part. There's some great restaurants downtown but not too much up on top of the hill. Tapatio is one notable exception. 

I always judge Mexican restaurants on the chips and salsa. If those are good and fresh, the food is usually pretty good as well. Tapatio checks both those boxes, fresh crunchy chips and great salsa. Also, the queso dip is a must. That shit is like crack, for serious. 

I've only eaten there once but it was with a very large group, notoriously difficult for any restaurant to handle. It's safe to say we overwhelmed them. That being said, everyone got their orders (all correct) and it didn't actually take too long. The chips and salsa kept coming and the beer was cold and plentiful. It's safe to say I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and staff. As a member of the military, it's good to see this location supports the hard working youth such as high school kids who are working hard for their earn. They support our military very well too, offering us a military discount. The real great quality about Tapatio? THE FOOD! My wife got the shrimp tacos and they were cooked to perfection. I got the Super Donkey, and I will say a damn good job the staff does to make your dining experience there, not only a pleasant one, but an outstanding one! I am definitely coming back again, and will be recommending this to all members I serve in the military this location!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and half for are food, and was awful... burnt to a crisp. Didn't even bring out more chips and salsa, or put utensils out. The table was soaking wet from the people before, I wouldn't recommend eating here to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison! We tried another Mexican restaurant in Madison and were disappointed in the food and service. Tapatio has been consistently good every time we have gone. If you don't know it's there it's definitely a little hidden."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison! Big fan of the queso dip, taco salad in it's giant, flaky taco-shaped shell, and fajitas."}
{"text":"currently madison's best mexican restaurant. consistent, affordable and the interior is delightfully tacky."}
