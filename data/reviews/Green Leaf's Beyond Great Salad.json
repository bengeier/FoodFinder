{"text":"Oh my gosh. Took forever. First it took 15 minutes to even order. But atleast an employee acknowledged me.  Everything is premade. so you cant substitute add etc. You think with everything being already prepped it wouldnt take forever. -_- WRONG. Not only did it take another ten minutes the 2 employees completely ignored me after i paid. terrible. will not be coming back here. Food subpare as well."}
{"text":"Sandwich made me extremely sick. I think I got food poisoning from it, so I don't think their stuff  is fresh. Lady helping me was really nice, but if you eat here, eat a sandwich from cold cuts, not chicken or a salad."}
{"text":"Panini  sandwich was ok but way too crunchy and dry for my taste. Giving it one star because they took  extremely long to make my food , we were going to get a frozen yogurt at this place too but didn't have an extra 30 min.  btw no one else in line so it's not like they were busy.... I dislike places that have employees talking about personal stuff vs taking care of the customer (I felt like I was interrupting the conversation) Def not coming back ."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing. I loved the selection, plus I got a smoothie too. It was a win, win. So good! Thank you, Angelica B."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place as I have discovered I have many new food restrictions. So to see something with healthy options was a relief as usually now my kids and husband eat and I sit there just to drink water.  Let's start with why this place earned 2 stars at all. It is only the great service that wants any stars. I would give the staff member 5 stars. The young lady was kind enough to go in back abs check ingredients of all their dressing options for me. She took the time and it was very thoughtful.  Let's get into why she was checking ingredients in the 1st place.  This place doesn't carry oil and vinegar. All salad dressing options contain syrup (cane) or sugar in some form.  When I sat down to eat I tooka mushroom 1st they were indeed fresh however not washed and I bit into dirt. Not appetizing. After I picked all the mushrooms out picked through the mushy greens in the spring greens I chose. Some were brown, some were like sludge, others were just wilted...needless to say it was a big disappointment. I was sad to see that healthy food also cost almost double what I paid for my kids to eat for chicken strip fries, a biscut, and coleslaw.  We won't be returning. Thank you to the amazing employee who took the time to check ingredients, but the food was horrid and way over priced."}
{"text":"It's good to finally have a healthy fast food option at the Mills. Green Leaf's is like a mini salad bar, you pick your lettuce either spring mix or romaine, four sides and a dressing for between 7-8 dollars. You can choose additional sides for a dollar a piece. Sides include the usual, cucumber, shrooms, olives, cheese, my favorite jalapenos etc..however they have a slightly seasoned tasty chicken, and big chunks of Bacon not bits but big bites of Bacon! At a quick glance there is a good selection of dressings at least ten, with a chipotle something or other and  Mmm sriracha..of which I didn't notice until after I chose the usual ranch, epic fail! The labels are hard to read in small print wrapped around the top of the bottles, and I didn't see them listed anywhere. My suggestion is they list them on the case, reducing squinting, and people's faces & handprints on the glass. Your salad selections are tossed in a big bowl, mixed with your desired  amount of dressing and put in a not as deep as it looks to go container. A decent deal and a healthier option for lunch, it's about time!"}
{"text":"We waited there, the only people in line, until another girl came up. Suddenly all the employees who had been ignoring us were very eager to work so they could wait on the PYT instead of us. Needless to say we were shocked so we took our business elsewhere. We asked the lady before we left why the girl who came after us was waited on first but we had no answer. I guess they must do a great business since they can clearly afford to lose customers."}
{"text":"Went to the location inside the Arizona Mills mall in Tempe.  Not sure if there are other locations.  I ordered a regular sized salad and this thing was a monster.  I couldn't hope to finish it all.  Everyone else around me was ordering sandwiches and those were giant as well.  Great place for fresh, healthy food and plenty of it...  Try it out!"}
{"text":".got the acai berry smoothie and the chicken salad with quinoa! It was pretty good! Would go back for smoothies again"}
{"text":"Yikes!! I usually love this place!!! Almost every time I'm at AZ mills and want a healthy option I go here.. until today... the lady next to me is eating her salad .. and then this she pulls out a metal long sliver wire. Looked like from a metal scrubber.   I mean extreme health code violation. And this lady could have had some major internal bleeding. She kindly goes up to be counter and hands the item back to the staff. The employee says. Oh. Yeah that's probably from the cleaning scrubber.. not even an apology. Not a free salad. Nothing..  I will not return. And for your safety. You shouldn't either. It was sad to see."}
{"text":"Asked them for the ingredients for their dressing. Told them I was allergic to eggs. Broke out into allergies. They didn't even offer to reimburse or asked if I was okay. Lawsuit coming their way."}
{"text":"Diana was very helpful and helped me pick out some great sides and food I had an amazing protein packed salad it was delicious.Diana was very helpful and helped me pick out some great sides and food I had an amazing protein packed salad it was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm here now.  Slowest service ever.  Constantly asked what I ordered again. People behind the counter moving with zero sense of urgency,  line around the corner,  why?"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not very good. I had a half BLT wrap with a side salad. The wrap was okay, but small. The salad was a bowl of lettuce with choice of two sides - a couple of cucumber slices and a small scoop of diced tomatoes. Had to pay for water, so I bought a soda - $3 for a bottle of Diet Pepsi. I was still hungry when I finished. Next time I'll go to Subway. Much better choices for a lot less money."}
