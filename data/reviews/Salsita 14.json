{"text":"I went here against my better judgement. My daughter insisted!! Walked in to their \"new\" location on Country Club just North of Main. They used to be at the corner of Main and Country Club~the old Sub shop building....anyway, we each ordered 3 tacos..that was it. The service was slow. We wandered over to the \"bug\" infested \"salsa bar\"..there were fruit flies or some other wordly little critters flying all over the place. ENOUGH SAID....NOt going back...thanks"}
{"text":"I ordered green chili plate and 2 carne asada burritos with guacamole and sour cream to go I get home and have 2 half oz sour creams and 1 guacamole that is already turning brown"}
{"text":"Tried this Mexican food spot for the first time today. I ordered the carne Assada fries and was very pleased! The meat was perfectly cooked and excellent flavor! Way better than any of the \"Berto's\""}
{"text":"To judge a restaurant solely on its presentation seems strange. I, personally, go to restaurants to eat, so I like to evaluate them based on the food itself.  When I visited Salsita's last night, I ordered the carne asada plate and a chicken taco, with grilled onions on the side, all for about  $11. The meats were tender and flavorful, the tortillas soft and warm, and the onions were grilled to a soft, carmelized perfection. I would have preferred my meal to be a little hotter. Overall, I think the quality and taste of the food match the price point. It is far above the usual fast food offerings, and a bit below what I would hope for at an authentic, more expensive restaurant.   I left Salsita's well-satisfied and happy to have found a solid Mexican fast food joint in the area. The restaurant itself and the staff are about average: Sufficient and unpolished.  In a word, Salsita's is decent."}
{"text":"Try the Torta Cubana- best I've ever had.  Carne Asada Tacos too.  The rest is meh."}
{"text":"Salsitas has some of best Mexican food in the East Valley, and the service is great. I love coming here with my friends and family, and supporting local business. They do Sonora style hot dogs grilled right out front on Friday nights around 7, and those have to be my favorite things on the menu. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner from Salsitas are always on point. Try the horchata and waters too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here Memorial Day weekend. I left the restaurant and threw up in the parking lot. I dont think their shredded beef is beef. I wanted to write a review then but was just sickened just thinking of this place.  This is what reminded me of my experience http://www.azfamily.com/story/36067770/dirty-dining-aug-4-2017-health-inspectors-find-cockroach-on-food-prep-table"}
