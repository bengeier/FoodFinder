{"text":"Hated it.  When we first walked in, the first thing we noticed was the stench of cigarette & cigar smoke.  The hostess was very unfriendly and didn't talk...she just walked us to a booth, put our silverware on the table, and walked away.  The fabric in the booths is noticeably filthy and old.  Speaking of old, their website says they have award-winning beer.  What they don't say is the most recent award was 11 years ago.  We ordered a magnificent mile meat lover pizza.  Please change the name...it's not magnificent.  It looked like someone dumped a jar of pizza sauce on top of it.  It was very watery and soupy.  We returned the pizza, paid for our soda & left."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday evening to hit up the 5-7PM Happy Hour (5-7PM and 10-midnight, I do believe).  Parking lot was crowded, but the place was not.  Busy, but not like we expected from the lot.

Sat in the downstairs bar area, and got a table no problem.  Great service.  Our waiter kept checking on us, even though we took our sweet time looking over the menu.  Settled on an all Happy Hour fair.

The beer ($6 pitcher):  We got the All-Nighter first.  It was good.  A nice, light blonde.  As expected.  Round 2 was the seasonal All-Nighter (Sommerbrau, maybe?).  This one was better.  Definitely worthy of my ordering it the next visit.

The food (prices guesstimate, from what I THINK I remember):  They had Chicken Fingers ($5- mild, hot, bbq, teryaki), Chili Cheese Fries ($4), Spinach Artichoke Dip ($6), 10-inch thin cheese pizza ($5), and there was one other item, but I can't think of what it was.  We had the Mild Chicken Fingers (pretty tasty, and plentiful), Spinach Artichoke Dip with tortilla chips (good, have had better, but have had worse), and the cheese pizza (filled the void, but probably wouldn't order again).

Overall:  $30 total (incl. tip) for 2 people, 2 pitchers, 3 apps, all HH items.  Will be back for more.  Next time, I'm thinking we'll try the 10LB burger though.  Sounds yummy!  And as we left, we peaked our heads upstairs and will probably look to sit up there the next time, as the couches were full but the tables were empty.  I would just question the amount of service attention we'd get up there."}
{"text":"We decided on this place since some of us wanted dinner while the rest just wanted a drink.  As a group of 7, we were seating right away as the place was pretty empty.  The waitress came by right away to take drink orders.  They had a blueberry vanilla ale on the menu, but when we ordered it, the waitress said they didn't have it, and then recommended some sort other beer with mango.  I ordered that just because it sounded interesting, and it was pleasantly surprising.  However, I do not recommend drinking this if you are going to be eating a full dinner.  The beer was full bodied and filling.  We also ordered a brewtus which was a 50 ounce glass filled with a beer of your choice for $15.  (You get to keep the glass.)  We chose the All Nighter which we all shared and enjoyed.  I think the best part about the brewtus was that refills were only $5!  Food-wise, everyone seemed satisfied with their food.  The artichoke dip and alfredo pizza were the two things that I found to be really good.  The service was really good here.  By the time we ordered, the place got busy but the waitress still made it a point to come by every few minutes to check on us.  I'd like to come back for their happy hour.  I glanced over their menu and they had some pretty good deals going on for their beer, well-drinks, wine, and munchies."}
{"text":"Beside the hostess having the personality of a rock, the service to follow wasn't to impressive either.
The food was great from everyone at the table point of view from it being quiet the whole time until we couldn't eat no more.
The drinks were good, no crafted beers were partaken at our table.
Maybe they were having an off night....."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for happy hour. Its was really good we has the calamari, beef sandwhich, Reuben. Was really tasty except for the ranch chips, I would not recommend to salty. Taste like They just put ranch mix seasoning on chips. Overall I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here on a regular basis and have never had a bad experience. Tabitha was our waitress and had been on multiple occasions. She is entirely awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is very small and the food was great!! My husband and I ordered the garlic knots and a small deep dish and it was more than enough for the both of us!! Bread is so filling and yummy. I also ordered the \"all nighter\" blonde ale, very good!! They need to hire more valuable workers though. The bartender barely even glanced at us when we walked in and there were no clean tables to sit at. There was one gentleman working (I regret not asking his name) but you could tell he was hustling to serve. He cleaned our table as quickly as he could and provided us excellent service the rest of the evening!"}
{"text":"I stayed 3 days and 2 nights at the Golden Nugget. The Four Queens is right next door and i wanted to try this place for the beer. My wife and i had the blonde,  brown, hef and stout.  They were all great.  We went 4 times during our stay.  The Chicago deep dish was awesome. We also had the sliders, wings,  fries and potato skins.  All of it was good. We meet 4 of the servers/bar tenders.  They were all nice and good company.  The next time we hit up Vegas, this will be our place to eat.  

Keep in mind it's a small place in the casino.  We love the local atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent guest to Chicago for a few years now and never seem to have even one complaint when popping in. The beer selection is great, food is always on point, and the customer service is always top notch. I found one of my now favorite Hefeweizens here through Mia. She recommended the Bavarian wheat Weizenheimer and I've been hooked ever since. I've returned numerous times specifically because of the experience Mia is responsible for. Always so polite, attentive, and informative.. Definitely a great place to stop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I don't want to stray from my burger reviews with so many places in town yet to try, but I feel compelled to talk about an interesting meal I had last week.  My girlfriend and I wanted to try something different for dinner, and I quickly remembered hearing about the wild game sliders that they serve over at the Chicago Brewing Company. One thing I like almost as much as burgers is trying weird and new foods, this promised to do just that.

While I suppose I should come back to try their burger at some point, this establishment is more on the 'typical' pub food side, and isn't necessarily on the top of my list for burgers to review. Still, the wild game aspect was intriguing enough to drag me in. The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy, pretty standard faire for a local restaurant. We went there on a random week night around 6pm, and quickly decided that based on the large amount of families and screaming kids the bar side would be better for our needs. Even though there are high top tables away from the bar itself, you can still anticipate a smoky atmosphere with mediocre service. We waited a bit too long to get our menus and first drinks, but after that it wasn't too bad.

There are six wild game sliders on the CBC's menu, each paired with what the chef believes to be the perfect complement to that meat's flavoring. You have the option of trying 3 of one style, or all 6 for a little less than twice the price. Based on a slider meal we had a couple days earlier, we knew that 6 sliders between the two of us would be more than enough and would allow us to divulge in all flavors.

Here's the rundown:

Alligator: from what I'm told alligator meat has very little flavor, so it is always seasoned to give whatever dish it is served as more character. Having a connotation with the cuisine of the south, this one is quite over seasoned with Cajun flavors. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but you really don't get an idea of what alligator tastes like based on this. The soft egg, Remoulade, and other toppings paired well with this.

Antelope: almost too gamey for my liking, but quite good. The meat was pretty much what I anticipated it to taste like. Again the jalapeno jelly and toppings all paired quite well with it. The meat might have been a tiny bit dry, but I'm not sure how much of that is a natural trait of antelope meat as opposed to it being a slider which is always inherently dry.

Bison: I'm always a big fan of bison meat, and this didn't disappoint. I buy bison steaks quite often at Whole Foods, and have also been known to make a great bison burger with some of the ground bison meat from Smith's. Unfortunately we're not treated with different toppings for the remainder of the meats I will mention, but as I've stated already they paired well so why mess with a good thing.

Jackelope: possibly one of my favorites of the bunch. Wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it turned out to be a great mix of two different meats, a little sweet with just the right amount of gamey. This one definitely stood out for me.

Rabbit: could have been my least favorite of the group. It seemed very gamey, stiff and dry, which I've heard should not be the case with rabbit meat. The dryness I could tack on to the slider size always being impossible to cook (see my review of Slidin' Thru coming soon), but I can't explain the gamey taste. Neither of us were really a fan, I think it was the only one that had a bite or so leftover.

Wild boar: a favorite of both of us. Picture a sausage patty, but the tastiest, purest form of that. I may not have gotten my full half of this one because someone else also really liked it, but what I had I enjoyed quite a bit.

Overall this meal was a lot of fun, the little signs on each patty are a great touch, and it's an easy way for the commoner to try something 'exotic' while still sticking with a familiar form. If you're feeling a little adventurous and want to try something different, definitely give them a visit. Their beer isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"If you need a quick, cheap bite on Fremont this is the place. They have great beer, service and food. I had wings and a burger and both were delicious. My husband had a Philly cheese steak and said it was too salty for his taste though. Overall this was quick and easy for us to take a break from gambling. Also, I should note that there is a cigar bar of some sort attached to the restaurant. I was nervous about this at first, but we experienced no smell or smoke from that section."}
{"text":"The service from the bar was not great when the waitress came over it became worse. Food was blah.  The staff was worried more about the gamblers at the bar. Waitresses were more worried about the bartenders."}
{"text":"Great food! Great bartenders.... Brad and Jason upstairs are awesome! I always get great service from them both. Ty have the ability to socialize and continue quality service. Def comin back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem and one of my favorites every time I visit Vegas.  The staff is always awesome, the food is great (amazing for the price) and the beers are decent.  (I would say in past years the brew was a little better than this trip, but still tasty enough.)  

They've added a non-smoking section so if you don't like cigar smoke with your food, it's no longer an issue. 

Did I mention that the staff is awesome?  Hard to describe, but the whole vibe of the place is great."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! The brewmaster does excellent work! I tried 6 beers: the stout, hefe, IPA, blueberry wheat, triple, and quadruple. All of them were excellent! I like trying breweries and craft brews everywhere I visit, and I usually find that each brewery has a couple of really good beers and a few not so good. At  Chicago brewing company, I did not try a single mediocre beer! This may be the best brewery I've been to, as the beers are across the board good, especially the triple and quadruple, which I hope they make permanent items. I typically do not like beers with fruit, so I ordered just a sample of the blueberry wheat. It was good, and the blueberry taste was neither fake nor overpowering. The food was decent, which is more of a bonus for me with a brewery. I had the happy hour chicken tenders, which were quite good. I then ordered some sliders, but I was so full from chicken tenders and beers, that I couldn't do much damage there. The sweet potato fries are waffle fries, and decent. The sliders were good too. My only disappointment was with the staff. The service was excellent, but when you go to a beer place, you expect to be surrounded by beer fanatics. Apparently the servers have a mild interest in beer at best. I still highly recommend this place to any beer connoisseur! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner, hostess was nice and friendly.  My friend ordered a chicken sandwich and I ordered country fried filet.  Both dishes were really tasty and the service was very good. We had the garlic knots for an appetiser and they were really tasty.  Would definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"the beer may be good but the food and the service was terrible i wouldn't reccommend this place to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome friendly bartenders, great food, fun gaming. Love this place, I have included Chicago brewing in my favorite bar list. Great service great food :) try the black & blue sliders or any of the pizzas you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Both Erin and Marlene are excellent bartenders and fun to hang out with. Good menu and a full bar to choose from."}
{"text":"I finally decided to go after passing it for quite a while and am happy I did!  I arrived quite early for breakfast so I sat in the down stairs bar area.  I ordered a regular breakfast(eggs, bacon, potatos) and started some small talk with the bartender when she mentioned to me about their blueberry-vanilla beer.  WOW!   Love it!  So refreshing and fruity!  I plan on going back for more!  You will see more check-ins here by me!  Service is friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, 3pm on a Thursday afternoon may not be the ideal time to assess a brew house, but it's worth logging the experience nevertheless. While the atmosphere at the bar wasn't unfriendly, it wasn't friendly either. Nothing like, \"be with you in moment\" or \"what can I get you\", but rather a somewhat removed bartender going through the perfunctory motions of his job and getting to you when he was good and ready, although without malice or attitude. Beyond that, the place seemed generally cheerless with a scattered assortment of that discomforting and singularly Vegasian type of the damned you run into occasionally off the Strip, not quite consigned to the clear, uncontested merit of hell, but somehow more vague and less defined--purgatorial or limbo-esqu--half plowed, engaged in chain smoking and vapid, pointless, loud conversation, or even worse, simply voiding any meaningful existence, head down, playing countertop video poker machines. The beer was certainly decent and what food came out of the kitchen looked adequate (at best). As a friend noted hours later after we'd left and found ourselves five minutes into a visit to Big Dog's Brewery, \"I already like this place a hundred times better than the Chicago Brewing Company.\" Woof."}
{"text":"Mia and Alex were our servers. The food, beverages and service were simply outstanding!! Happy New Year"}
{"text":"The root beer is excellent. The flavor of the Chicago pizza is decent but tonight they had poor production. The pizza was paper-thin in the center and very thin for the rest of the bottom. The edges were like popovers and so thick the inside was doughy and not fully cooked. The sauce was so runny that after taking one piece out, the sauce actually ran out into the pan. There isn't any cornmeal in the crust either. Maybe it's better with different preparers, but tonight was not a good night for them."}
{"text":"I honestly did not have one sub-par item in this place. I ordered the 10 piece hot wings and my buddy ordered the 10 piece barbecue wings and they were both equally delicious. The beers were just as delicious as the wings. I ordered a brown ale that had a delicious nutty flavor. The garlic knots, as everyone else here has raved about, are garlic buttery heaven."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I have to say that If you can't eat the crust by itself, its not good pizza. This is one of the few places in Las Vegas that got it right. Make sure you order the Garlic Knots. I highly recommend them and The Cinnamon Roll knots are awesome."}
{"text":"have been trying out some Brewery's around town.  My friend went to this one said I needed to try it out.  The beer we had was the Amber and their Stout.  They were both pretty good.  I had the Chicago Dog, in order to fulfill my chicago cravings.  It was a good dog, but nothing like what you get at Wrigley.
Upstairs is a smoking/cigar lounge.  Its a cool place to hang out, specially if you like cigars.  In terms of the service, it was to be expected.  The bartenders there were friendly and accommodating.  There isn't much more to ask for from an environment like this.  Either way, a pretty good place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"We had the white pizza and a glass of their homemade root beer.  The white pizza was delicious. We also had the potato skins, but they weren't anything special. I would definitely go back for the pizza. We stopped for lunch.  It's a small place with tvs to watch the game."}
{"text":"Bar area tends to be smoky, but the patio is a great atmosphere and always good times."}
{"text":"New menu recently went into effect. Literally 90% of the dishes my family ordered are now not available or changed. For example the steak sandwich is still available but now it's a flat iron instead of a New York strip steak. No more fried filet mignon entree or sliders. No more ranch chips....and the list goes on. 

I tried to keep an open mind even after the disappointment of the new menu but unfortunately the food we ordered was just as disappointing. The biggest disappointment was the under cooked under seasoned hot wings. The skin was slimy not crisp and the hot sauce flavor was nonexistent. 

So sad to see another good restaurant go downhill."}
{"text":"This isnt my favorite restaurant by an means. I didn't have plans to go often in cravings for typical \"bar food\" , however I do like how they offer non smoking area. Tonight gave me another reason to come back more often, Rorke was one f the best servers I have had; constantly cleaned our area and kept our drinks full. So kind and patient highly recommend asking for him! Thanks man!!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good price, nice atmosphere and also good appetizers. Good place to meet up for drinks, to start the night or to catch a game."}
{"text":"I came in late Saturday night and I guess they were having a anniversary party. I was very upset with the service, the bartender up stairs was rude, drunk, threw a water bottle at 2 girls walking out, as he continued to talk badly about them after they left. He wouldn't serve anyone a drink and was very unprofessional, and drunk and complaining that people don't tip! I will not be back to this establishment, to let your bartenders get that drunk and be that rude to customers, they don't deserve the job the have."}
{"text":"We each had two beer samplers in cute mini mugs, fried calamari and shared the deep dish pizza. 

The beer was good, but very \"middle of the road.\" It didn't seem like they took a lot of chances with the beer and just went with what would sell.

The calamari was delicious, as was the deep dish pizza. It's only 9 inches, but it's more than enough for two people to share, especially after sampling a ton of beer!

The real stand out for me was the root beer. It was AMAZING! The server even made me a mixed drink with root beer and vanilla vodka. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had, The server was great and after a minor incident he took the drinks off of the bill. What he did was very respectful and I am very glad I had him as our server. Next time you go ask for Billy, because he is by far one of the best. Their other service is good but this man gets a 10/10"}
{"text":"Had a craving for potato skins, so went here before a movie at Red Rock.  To my surprise, was told they changed their menu and no longer make them.  What's up with that?  They didnt bother to change their online menu and that's the only reason i went.  Since we were already there, had the trio of filet mignon sliders served with au jus which were tender and actually good.  Also had their onion rings, good but not as yummy as fleming's stack.  Also ordered their chicken quesadilla.  Yuck, made with overgrown dried out triangular crackers.  Tried their light beer they brew themselves.  Not impressed.  The highlight of the whole dining experience was seeing the girl next to us win 800 bucks at keno, of all things!"}
{"text":"Went for first and last  time yesterday. I am from Chicago and went to watch the Cubs playoff game. We were excited to meet other fans, but disappointed to learn this is not really a \"Chicago\" establishment as the name implies. Different tables of us were given conflicting information about happy hour and about their policy on watching the game. We were told in the downstairs bar that they only provide sound for the game in the upstairs bar, so we had to move upstairs. That was fine, but once there we were informed that a private party had reserved the space, so we could not listen to the whole game. Another employee then told us that the party would be in a separate room and we actually could keep the sound. We specified that we needed to know for sure so we could decide whether to stay or go watch the game elsewhere and were reassured we should stay. So, we ordered more food and drinks and invited other friends to join us, bringing the group up to 6 people. It was extremely frustrating when employees then turned off the sound and we then had to watch several innings while listening to crap music instead. The bartender did take mercy and we were able to hear the final inning. The bartender was actually amazing, running drinks and food out to us from behind the bar even though he was the only one up there. The beer was good, pork sliders good, and pretzel bites were good. The caprese salad was disappointing, and the garlic bites were cold by the time they got to us. Overall, it was a disappointing and frustrating game watching experience, for which I blame poor management. The employees did their best given a poorly planned event."}
{"text":"Chicago Brew Co. has become our neighborhood bar over the past five years we have been going there.

I am not a HUGE fan of their food but I can tell you that their Spinach Artichoke Dip is KILLER and if you catch Happy Hour, you can get it for a helluva deal at $4 or so.

Their Happy Hour in general has a lot to do with why this is one of my favorite bars. They have traditional happy hour along with a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 and is good in the Beer Garden (fantastic outdoor patio with stringed lights) and the Loft (located upstairs and where you can find me a majority of the time). Their (tasty) brewed-in-house beer is 1/2 off and I think it's $1 off wine and well drinks, too. 

The atmosphere and staff of this bar is what got them the \"Yay! I'm a fan\" rating from me. Everyone is super friendly and it's one bar that doesn't feel like your run-of-the-mill PT's thanks to The Loft and the Beer Garden. 

My only complaint is they recently got rid of their Big Buck Hunter game machine. This may sound ridic but a girl's gotta hunt."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this brewery.  We shared the beer sampler, which was fun and generously poured.  We also shared a few appetizers.  The food was better than expected and artistically plated, I was impressed.  We shared the blue sliders, a Margherita pizza, which was very authentic to one I ate in Pisa, Italy.  I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Food is okay at best but the beer is AMAZING! My favorite is the All Nighter and the sampler (you get to try 9 of their beers, including specialty and seasonal ones ) Its also really cool to bring beer lovers here or friends out of town because they brew their own beer in house which makes for a great visual."}
{"text":"I'm going to upgrade my rating for Chicago Brewing Company to 4 stars based on the last 2 times I went there prior to moving away. The food which I originally thought was just OK seemed to have gotten better and more interesting. The last time I was there, my friend and I shared a sampler of their wild game sliders. I believe we got the alligator, jackalope and wild boar. And, as always, they have a nice, rotating selections of their own locally brewed beer."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic deals on food during Happy Hour and I love their Pot Roast and Full Rack of Ribs!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chicago deep dish pizza in Las Vegas.  Definitely beats B.J's deep dish, maybe Amore's...  not sure I think I have to go back to make sure since it's been a while.  The crust is amazing and for sure the best crust I've ever had in my life!  Also had the garlic knots which were decent."}
{"text":"Stick to the beer and pizza and you'll be fine.  I've had most of their beers and they are very good.  I like the amber beer in particular.  The pizzas that I've had are good, although, I have to wonder what they mean by thin crust, Chicago pizza.  I don't think the menu writer has been to Chicago.  As to the idea of eating anything other than the pizza, forget it.

On a recent trip to Chicago Brewing, we got the steak sandwich and the Huli chicken sandwich.  The steak sandwich comes on a large roll with the steak inside smothered in some sort of mayonnaise based glop.  You would have to unhinge your jaw to take a bite.  No problem though, the greasy stuff they coat the steak with acts as a lubricant and with only a slight tilt, the top slides right off.  After I scraped off as much of the oily mess as possible, I took my first bite. I found the meat sufficiently tough that it would take a school of Piranhas about a week to consume.  Resorting to a knife, I chiseled my way to a second bite only to discover I was eating a solid piece of gristle.  Disgusting.  My waitress agreed and I was spared paying for this tribute to the lowest consumable grade of meat the USDA permits restaurants to legally serve. 

Then there was the Chicken sandwich.  It was so dry that I do not believe it could have been served in a place where smoking is permitted due to the imminent fire hazard posed by the flammable material found in the bun.  The skin on the chicken could not be pierced by anything short of an industrial laser, although,  I'm certain that any Texan would love to have a pair of boots made of this stuff.  Eating it, however, is out of the question.

Go to Chicago Brewing for beer and pizza and avoid getting too adventurous when ordering from the menu."}
{"text":"MEH.  Maybe I am spoiled at home, but this place would not pass for a 4 star in Houston."}
{"text":"Good Za' and nice beer selection, comfy environment with slots as far as the eye can see. Bartender topped off our beers (half empty on our way out) before we left! I recommend popping in here when you're on Fremont"}
{"text":"As a pizza fanatic I always try to stop by when visiting Fremont for their Chicago Deep Dish and chicken wings then wash it all down with their tasty Brown ale. Step away from the excitement of the casino a bit and check out this Hidden gem inside the 4 queens and you will not be disappointed. Very relaxing environment. Servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"All I have to say is the blueberry vanilla wheat beer is AH-mazing! Haven't been able to find anything like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Service slow with no one in restaurant. Staff worried more about schedule than customers"}
{"text":"I signed up for a yelp account JUST to save other people from going to this place. We had to go LOOK for a server to get his attention. The pizza here was awful, which means you're screwed because there's basically nothing else on the menu. This restaurant is also very tiny and.has limited seating and is far from the main drag. ...the two friends I was with also said their pizza was poor. One of them described their pizza crust as \"tasting like charcoal.\" ...the beer was okay, except we went for dinner. Perhaps the other reviewers drank a little too much before posting their thoughts."}
{"text":"Like the place. Great prices, Not too expensive. Good food for a bar"}
{"text":"I definitely won't be returning here. My wife and I are new to town and wanted to start checking out the \"local\" scene! We were recommended to this place, and let's just say we won't be returning. The service was painfully slow and they weren't even busy. We ended up deciding to just share an appetizer, so we got chicken wings. I enjoy sauce, my wife does not, so I asked to get the BBQ on the side. They wanted to charge extra to put it on the side, the same sauce they would have put ON it. We both got one drink, the one appetizer, and ended up spending almost $30 on just three items. We will be going else where from now on."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but service was lacking. We sat outside and enjoyed the day. Would return if I was in the area but definitely not seeking it out..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very accommodating. Put tables together, Alicia was very attentive and took care of everything."}
{"text":"Awesome Hefeweizen! 

Great food and the best bartenders around!

We always stop by when we're in town!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place to relax downtown. They make some of the best microbrews in Las Vegas, and have some great food to go with it. The Cheesy Garlic Knots, and the Deep Dish Pizzas are my favorites."}
{"text":"First time I came here was with an old friend.  We sat upstairs at the bar and enjoyed each others company along with 50 others that were nothing but friendly.  The bartender was a sweetie and so was everyone else.  Drinks were average, but at least they listen to you when you say \"No Ice.\"  I enjoyed my evening as we wondered downstairs since they close the upstairs. 

Everyone was wonderful and our bill was only half of what we expected.   It made my night wonderful and I'll never forget it.  Thank you guys for making that evening wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was in Sin City for an Allman Brothers show in Red Rocks Casino when I found this little gem.  Actually I always look for Brew pubs around any area I travel to and try to taste different beers.  I stopped in for lunch and some beers.  I sat at the bar positioning myself to see the Red Sox game.  There are plenty of big screens in this place and they have all the games.  The restaurant was divided between restaurant and bar, smoking was allowed in the bar but not in the restaurant.  This was a clean and cozy place which had an upstairs lounge,  The bar  had about 8-9 beers of their own beer on tap and I started off with the Ramblin Wreck amber ale.  This was a nice refreshing beer, ice cold and ran about 4.5% alcohol.  I then scoped the menu and quickly honed in the Filet Mignon Sliders, the thought of fillet sliders made me forget about the other things on the menu although I did see  Cheese Knots on the appetizer menu.......hmmm.  So, I ordered the sliders and my next beer reluctantly passing on the garlic-cheese knots(next time....).  Being a \"hop-head\", I ordered the Hard Play IPA.  Though not as strong as I thought, this beer had plenty of hops.
Being a Sunday afternoon, there were several locals playing video poker at the bar and some just getting plastered on Jaeger bombs at 1:30 in the afternoon.  After the barkeep carded and shooed away two under aged kids, he brought out my trio of goodness.  There sat in front of me three sliders made from fillet mignon loin, grilled onions and mushrooms served with au jus.  So I started to dig in, man what an experience and guess what I had three of these little morsels to satisfy me.  Too bad I was pressed for time or else I would have tried more of their beers.  This is a good place to hang out and the service was great.  I would definitely stagger back in here, even though it's about 11 miles from the stip.  In fact I might just drag the Buffet Boys to this place next month, when we take over Vegas.  Look for Buffet Boys invade Vegas.........................
Oh yeah, the concert that's another story.............."}
{"text":"This place a dear friend brought me to for the 1st time. It's a nice bar/restaurant. Good simple foods and good ambiance."}
{"text":"This place was our happy hour hang out. We visited about once a week or two, but no more. We have two kids, so have to sit in the restaurant. Well, as of this week, they no longer offer happy hour in the restaurant. Only in the VERY smokey bar. I think the beer is \"OK\", but I see more and more people ordering buds, bud lights, etc. I know they do not care, but we will never go there again. Thanks for canceling happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great beer, good appetizers, and fair to middling' meals. Pizza looked great. I would definitely come back, but be selective with the menu. And order the beer sampler!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since arriving on Las Vegas and both meals have been great, accompanied by superior service from Kierra and Bob. The IPA is insane and the foods has been yummy. I'll be back next trip If not before."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever written a restaurant review. It's not anything I've felt compelled to do before, but after the experience I had at the Chicago Brewing Company I feel like it's my civic duty to warn others. We are new to the area, and after perusing menus online we chose the Chicago Brewing Company for our first outing because the menu we saw said they had wild game sliders. After we were seated we discovered they were no longer on the menu. We should have left then, but we'd already ordered a beer so we decided to stay. Instead I ordered the steak sandwich. My husband ordered the filet mignon sliders, and we got a couple of kids meals for our children. My husband and children's meals were bland, forgettable, and overpriced. How I wish I had anything that good to report about my steak sandwich. 

I love steak sandwiches. Anytime I see one on a menu I order it. This was the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea they could even be bad until I had that one. I ordered my steak medium, and when it arrived it was so rare it was purple. I like rare steak, so I didn't send it back. The steak was much smaller than the roll it was served on, it had a pile approximately three inches thick of the white, flavorless part of a head of iceberg lettuce, and it was drowned in so much garlic aioli that it basically tasted like a garlic sandwich. You could barely taste the steak, which was too bad because maybe if we could have we would have realized it was rotten. The steak was covered with so much melted cheese that it appeared as though the Blob were attempting to digest it. At least the Blob could have digested it. My husband and I could not. My sandwich was so terrible that I gave it to my husband, who ate the steak only in an attempt to at least get our $14 worth out of the meal. We aren't generally complainers, and our waitress was nice, so we said nothing, tipped our waitress, left, and walked around the Village Square shopping center. I stayed longer, but my husband went home, where he proceeded to get violently ill. I hadn't eaten nearly as much of the sandwich as he had, so it took a little longer for my food poisoning to kick in. 

Later that night I called the restaurant to tell them so they wouldn't serve the steak to anyone else. The kitchen manager told me it takes six hours for food poisoning to kick in, which is a lie. He said the general manager would call back the next day. That was also a lie. I decided to look the Chicago Brewing Company up on Yelp, and that was when I noticed four other people complaining about being sickened by this restaurant. That makes me number five, and that's just five who bothered reporting it to Yelp. God knows how many people have actually gotten sick from this place. It's clear they must be keeping their food around long after it should have been tossed out. It's a tiny restaurant and it seems to mostly just be a place to eat while you are gambling, so their food turnover is probably not that high on certain items--one of which I'm going to assume is the steak. 

It's not a coincidence that people are getting sick there. Save your money and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Ordering the Doritos Tacos Locos at the Taco Bell next door is less likely to sicken you and ruin the rest of your weekend, and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Delicious juicy burgers and beer! I went with my girlfriend and friend on a recommendation. We were met within a minute to be seated and our server followed right after we were seated. Good start!

 First off, I was recommended the Old Town Brown Ale. Absolutely fabulous! I must say that this beer was better than one of my tried and true favorites, Newcastle Brown Ale. (I never thought I'd ever say such a thing)

The pizza looked amazing but I was more inclined to try their BBQ burger, medium, of course. Very savory and delicious burger! I was absolutely enamored with the combination of burger and beer that I had ordered. I also had a chance to sample my friend's filet mignon slider and the au jus that it came with. Another fabulous choice! The burger was tender, juicy, and the au jus was excellent. Not over powering or to salty like some. Mouth watering!

Needless to say, I will be back to try their tempting looking pizza soon!"}
{"text":"I like this place alot. Mainly has to do with the beer, but it has its other benefits.

Food is a good mix of pub / restaurant fare. Dining area is completely seperate from bar and lounge. I have brought my family with two young ones here quite a few times for dinner, as atmosphere provides enough distraction that my kids are not bothering others patrons.

Lounge area outside and upstairs are great and offer nice happy hour specials, even late. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This happens to be the coolest little spot on downtown. Tucked away in the corner of the Four Queens, you will find some of the tastiest beers on Fremont.

Its got a typical pub food selection. Garlic Knots are a tasty. Anytime I bring people to see \"Old Vegas\" I slip them in here a little treat."}
{"text":"Last night i ordered the windy city deep dish pizza and it's was delicious! My server bella was very professional and attentive towards myself & my guest....i would highly recommend everyone to go and experience the top notch service and the delicious food here!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, clean, lots of places to watch games etc pizza is not bad and the beer is good, I reccomend this place"}
{"text":"After a few trips, a solid personal pizza with great sauce.  Decent selection of sandwiches.  Tasty craft brew, try the amber.  Cigar after food, excellent. Big screen TVs for games, multiple locations so you're not struggling.  Don't go to Fremont Street if you're looking for good service people.  \"'Cause this shit is REAL\".  If the place is busy, it may be slow.  Forgive a little and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"Love Kimmie and most of the bartenders here; the beers and food are very good, but the bartender with Kimmie on Xmas sucked.  20 minutes to get a menu and after an hour not even a look.  Had bad service from her before but played it off.  The gentlemen next to me were not even playing full quarters and got served several times.  Will go back but not if she is there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have never been before, so last night while we were trying to figure out what to eat I suggested Chicago brewing company. Big big mistake, my husband ordered hot wings. He said they were some of the worst he had ever had. He said they weren't hot enough and were terribly dry. I had a chili burger with fries. The one thing that was right was the way my burger was cooked, other than that it wasn't good. My fries were cold, my chili was cold and the flavor was off. The food in mine and my husbands opinion was a huge let down, especially since we had heard such great things. The service was good, our server was very attentive and accommodating. We can be pretty tough customers when it comes to certain things and she handled it well, she was a wonderful waitress. If you want to go for the food beware, steer clear of the hot wings and chili burgers. Such a let down."}
{"text":"They have the best onion rings here! I always get their chicken tenders with a side of their ghost sauce! I'm never disappointed coming here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  Small bar food menu, but very good.  Had the Philly Steak Sandwich and an iced tea and hit the spot.  I love patronizing downtown businesses when I get the chance since I don't work too far away from there.  Have friends coming in next week staying at El Cortez so we'll probably have to hit this place in the evening when things are a little livelier."}
{"text":"Last night went to chicago bar and had such a good time, their house beer is really good and bartenders are really nice people, the lady downstairs such a sweetheart and the guy upstairs all kinds of funny! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company does not honor their Happy Hour prices on Saturday as per their website.  The Blonde/Golden Ale metal winner is good as yellow toilet water.  The beer is underwhelming and over price."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends. The service is fine, a decent happy hour, good brews and tasty food. Been to a couple other brew pubs in town and Chicago leads the pack. I will be going back.."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant a year ago and loved it, food was great and our server was awesome. We decided to visit again on this trip as we were staying at the Four Queens this time. We looked forward to our return. Unfortunately, second time is not a charm. It was busy due to a football game but we waited for a table to open while we had a drink at the bar. The original bartender/server was friendly and we are pretty sure he was our awesome server from a year ago. However, when we finally got a table, our server was not friendly. I can understand being busy but courteous customer service shouldn't go out the door when you are having a bad night. As for the food, that was a headache. We ordered the garlic knots, filet mignon sliders, and the uptown roasted garlic chicken pizza. I ordered a bloody mary as well while my wife just had a beer. First, the bloody mary wasn't the most horrible I had in Las Vegas but it just tasted like tomato juice water. I received the pizza fairly quickly and it was okay. As it cooled, it tasted less great and more eh. My wife still hadn't received her sliders when I finished my fill of the pizza and I am a very slow eater. We had to inquire about the sliders and finally got them after ten more minutes. Even after my wife finished off the sliders which she found to be okay but nothing special, we still hadn't received the garlic knots, which should have been first. After waiting another ten minutes, we were done with the waiting, informed our server to cancel the order and that we just wanted a to go box for the pizza. He half heartedly tossed us a box and I watched as our server informed the chef of our cancellation which seemed to make the chef huffy, as apparently our garlic knots were finally done, forty minutes into our dinner. We left soon after and are unsure if we will visit again. We were left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company in the Four Queens Casino is like an express version of the Fort Apache location - seat yourself and pay at the front on your way out.  That said, they still take your order and deliver your food tableside.  It's quick, high-quality and reasonably priced for being in a downtown casino.  The 22oz drafts are $5.  My favorite brew is the Ramblin' Wreck which is a cross between a Smithwicks and a Guiness.  The large pizza is crisp, tastey, plenty for two people and starts  is about $16 for a cheese version.  This location doesn't have a happy hour.   They have lots of TVs so you can catch your favorite game.  The place is kind of small so you'll have difficulties with groups larger than about 6 people.

The only place better for pizza downtown is the Grotto in Golden Nugget.  You will pay more at the Grotto unless you go during the weekday happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is terrible.  I've been there 3 times, and it's always been horrendously slow, despite the place not being very busy (5 tables seated max).

Today was the last straw.  My friend ordered the artichoke spinach dip, and the waiter botched it.  The waiter put the order in as chili.  By the time the corrected dish came out of the kitchen, my friend had to leave, and couldn't even eat her food.

When I got the check, I found the waiter had rung up my friend's Diet Coke as a 14 oz beer, charging me $5 for a soft drink.

I will never go back there, and I told the staff why."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Las Vegas from LA. So happy to be back at CBC as it has been one of our favorite local hangouts for years. The bartenders, servers, and hosts are great at their jobs. We've known bartenders Jesse, Alan, Michelle and Brady for years and they are like family. Great food, fun and people!"}
{"text":"I went here perhaps a year ago, and AGAIN, my husband and I WALKED OUT because no one served us in over 20 minutes. Not even a \"We'll be with you shortly.\" The hostess DIDN'T even saying anything when we left. NOTHING! Didn't try to stop us or ask what happened. They do NOT care about their customers at all. Goodbye forever!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We've been going for years because of the great food and awesome beer. Nice environment. If it's busy, it will take longer for service in the table area of the bar, but overall this is an excellent place."}
{"text":"Interesting menu~ looking forward to exploring it further! \"Black and Bleu Sliders\" are a culinary head trip~  To start with, they are thicker than most, and mine were cooked to perfection! (Tasted like beef~ Seriously!) The carmelized onions were sweet, candy-sweet~ The chipotle-mayo was a sneaky character~ An intensifier~ And the acid from the Bleu crumbles balanced the bite to perfection!  Steak fries were crisp and airy, which was a pleasant surprise for a Vegas Pub~ They do this one right, and if you are a food-dude or dudette~ Do yourself a favor and give this one a try!  
The staff was busy and pleasant in the downstairs bar, and the basketball playoff game was drama, even if you're not a huge fan of the sport~
A nice deviation from most Vegas pub food~"}
{"text":"came here for the first time with a few friends and tried the beer sampler and got a 22oz Old Town Brown which was great... was able to discover that i don't like light beers and really only like dark stout beers... IPAs just aren't my thing.

PS, beer buzzes feel interesting when you aren't a beer drinker and start getting pretty drunk off 40+ ounces of beer. definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I was here this weekend got pizza and some home brewed root beer. I have had severe stomach pains and sleepness nights and not to mention everything else that accompanies stomach pains. Its been 6 days now and I am still not recovered. Not sure if it was the root beer or the pizza, but man i am sure sorry i ever ordered that and ate here!

Update! Took 8 days to totally heal no more rest room stops every 2hrs and no more stomach pains.  Worst 8 days of my life.  Thank God that's over.  Needless to say i will never come here again."}
{"text":"Holy moly. I think I just ate an entire cow. And then some.

First off, heads up: If you're looking for a beer review, go check out Elite Emily's review. I'm not a huge beer drinker and can't really tell the difference between a stout or an IPA, I can't tell which one had more hops and which one had more malt. I'm even worse at beer than wine (and I'm pretty bad at wine), so if you're looking for that, sorry.

But if you're looking for a food review, I just had the Chicago Chili Burger. This thing should have its own ZIP code. It's huge. They serve a huge patty open-faced -- not even trying to hide it, like, \"Oooh, we put a tiny bun on top so it looks bigger...\" No, it was like, \"MAN UP, SPARKY, THIS AIN'T OUR FIRST TIME AT THE RO-DEE-O.\" Then, on top of this delicious hunk of meat (the burger, not me) they pour on some sloppy, messy chili and green onions on top of it.

This is no sissy burger. This is not one of them chain restaurants \"Oh look we dropped a bit of chili on this burger\" burger. This is a burger that looks your daddy straight in the eye then makes out with your momma then slaps your sister upside the head while walking out your front door and fist-bumping with some very bad dudes.

Grab your fork. This burger ain't here to f**k around.

It was a test, but it was also really good. The meat was juicy and tender, and the chili was really tasty. It was a sweeter chili, since of course it was Chicago-style, so I wish it had a little more spice to it, but that would be my only complaint. Otherwise, A+, gold star, attaboy.

BUT WAIT! There's more!

One look at their dessert menu will give anyone a foodierection. I was looking at something called \"Blondie & Clyde\" which is like a mash-up of a brownie plus a butterscotch bar, but on the bottom of the page were their deep-fried treats. Elite Emily and I share a weird love/hate relationship with deep-fried anything, and she spotted the deep-fried carmel apple (which was either a caramel apple or an apple from Carmel, CA). Hector went with the deep-fried honey bun, and I couldn't be the odd man out, so I indulged in the deep-fried Ho-Ho.

I loved mine... the deep-fried Ho-Ho reminded me of a chocolate chip donut bar, and the deep-fried honey bun was like a bear claw. But I was most impressed by the deep-fried carmel apple. As you bit into it, you heard a \"crunch.\" This is because somehow, after the apple is deep-fried, somehow it still comes out crisp and tart! It's really great, you have to try it to believe it.

Great place, I highly recommend it, under one condition: don't go see a movie right after it, because it's bound to lead to food coma."}
{"text":"This place is the schiznit! Good food. Good brew. Sports on the tube. No complaints......"}
{"text":"I liked the other location so much i had to go to this one and i was not disappointed. Their chicago deep dish pizza is on point. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Really good New York style pizza,better then their Chicago style in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to get a late night snack. The menu is pretty straightforward and the food is good (pulled pork Mac and cheese, guys). The prices are also reasonable and the service is good too. The location is super convenient; especially after a movie or on the way home after a show or a night out. It's great to have late options that aren't on the Strip and aren't fast food!"}
{"text":"I have to give this 3 stars because of the food & food alone. I've been here more than a handful of times & before, I always sat in the dining room. There, the service is excellent.

But the last couple of time I went, me & my guy sat in the bar. We went in the middle of the week & usually around 12 or 1 for lunch. I understand that the servers that wait in the bar area also have tables in the dining room area but they need to manage their tables better.

Our server was nice enough, a bit awkward & standoffish. He took our drink order & my guy wanted to sample a couple of their house beers which the server brought quickly enough. Then he went into the dining room & didn't reappear for a while. My guy had decided which beer he wanted to order but our server was nowhere to be found. No biggie, we waited & another server ended up asking us if we needed something. After we placed our order & my guy got his beer, the wait wasn't long for our food to come out. And boy was it amazing!

I've had their baked ziti with chicken (which I adore) & their pizza & both have been excellent but for lunch I love getting sandwiches from bars. So I ordered their hot pastrami sandwich (for the second time) & bf got their \"black & blue sliders\" & instead of regular fries, upgraded to their smokehouse fries. (Note: I may be wrong about the name of the fries. Basically it's steak fries with melted cheese, bacon, chives, creme fresh, & other stuff I think) 

The pastrami sandwich is awesome! It's served on marble rye bread (my favorite rye) that is crispy & crunchy & not at all soggy, the pastrami is perfect, and it comes with melted Swiss cheese & cole slaw (on the sandwich). The combination of the hot pastrami & the cool crispy cole slaw is divine. It's exactly the way a sandwich should be made. My hats are off to the cooks. My side was their regular fries which are pretty lackluster & bland. But I never care about the fries. 

Bf said the black & blue sliders were good (who can go wrong with steak & bleu cheese?) but that the \"smokehouse fries\" were not very good. I had a bite & they were alright but very sweet. 

The problem was what happened after we got our food. The server asked us if we needed anything else & we said no....and then he didn't come to our table again until we made it obvious we needed him. He came in a couple of times but never came up to us. Once even when we were done with our food and clearly just sitting there. Finally he came in, took an order at the table next to us, went on our other side & asked if that table wanted more beer, and eventually landed at our table. We asked him for a box & the check & when he came back, I just handed him my debit card without even looking at the check. And I NEVER do that. But I was afraid we'd never see him again. He came back fairly quickly & gave me my receipt. While this was going on, another couple had come in & sat at a table & no one had come up to them at all in 5 minutes. No acknowledgement, no menus, nada. They got mad & left. I could see the woman telling the hostess & being pretty upset about it & frankly, I don't blame her. I would have done the same thing. Our server could at least acknowledged her. He saw that they had left & after the woman stopped talking to the hostess & walked out, that's when he walked out to the host stand to inquire about it. Nice. 

Bottom line: if you want to eat in the bar area, prepare to wait. If it wasn't for their awesome food, I'd never go back again. But sometimes you have to put up with sub-par service if you want a great meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We are locals and stopped in for a brew and had a great time! Special thanks to Bob our bartender for being awesome! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot off the Fremont street. The food was ok but the real spot light for this place is the beer, They also have a cigar lounge that I thought was cool. We will always have to spot by when in town."}
{"text":"Friendly service, awesome beer (All Nighter especially) and great food at great prices. They even made us one of the biggest and best nacho plates ever though not even on the menu. And best of all, it is right across the street from us. Couldn't ask for more !!!!"}
{"text":"BABY DON'T YA WANNA GO?  Sweet Home Chicago!

As a born and bred Chicagoan, I was really excited when I first  saw the glowing 'CHICAGO\" shining on to Fort Apache.  I've been several times since then and always come to the same conclusion:

Awesome variety, average food, good beer.

This menu has something for everyone.  They have wild game burgers such as Alligator and Elk, deep dish pizza, and a lot of standard fare.  What has got me buzzing since my last visit though was the Ghost Burger.

For those of you who have ever watched the TV show Man Vs. Food, you know all too well about the hauntingly hot ghost chili, but have you ever tried it?  A lover of all things hot, I was thrilled to learn that Chicago Brewing Company had several items on the menu featuring the ghost chili.  I have a good tolerance for heat, but let me tell you that the ghost chili is the REAL DEAL!  After my first bite, my mouth was an inferno of pain, my face began to sweat, and I couldn't reach for my mug fast enough.  I struggled to get through all the burger, but did it. 

It was an experience I'm happy to have had, and would never relive.  Expand your horizons, and taste some fire!

Bottom Line:  Great selection on the menu and good beer make this brewery a great destination for happy hours and group gatherings."}
{"text":"Place had a really good IPA. I went with a local that has lived here for 30 years. He was right about this place it is really good. The beer was good as well as the pizza and appetizers. Would go there again.  I could recommend it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because of a recommendation. All I can say is \"mistake\" we went here with some friends and from the second we pulled into the parking lot I was already leary of it. The location looked a bit tired and run down but everyone was pretty hungry so we tried it. The inside of the restaurant was just as depressing it doesn't really feel like a restaurant inside I can't pinpoint what it felt like but the atmosphere was just not nice. The manager or the guy who was dressed like the manager seemed inattentive to the restaurant and was just walking around but not really doing anything.  Our waitress was great but that's about where the great stops for this place.  One of the people in our party got pretty sick the next day. We were all pretty thankful we didn't eat the same thing they had. Needless to say we will never go back to this place and I will never ignore my gut feeling."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the Brewery and upstairs lounge. 
I have only ever had a couple appetizers so I can't really rate the restaurant. 

The IPA, Hefeweizen and Old Town Brown are soooooo good. Happy hour prices are very reasonable. Worth the drive to westside of town. They also have a location on Fremont St."}
{"text":"To be honest, their house beer is \"eh\", but for the price it's really hard to go anywhere else. Especially during NFL season when you can get pitchers for $6!!! They have already helped provide a catalyst for my alcoholism. 

Also, the bar food is amazing and kitchen is open 24 hours.

It definitely is a local bar and every time I go in I see the \"usual suspects\" hanging around there, kinda like the Cheers bar :)

Stop in and have a drink...or don't, more beer for me."}
{"text":"This was convenient to our hotel and we were looking forward to trying their brews.  My companion said his beer was too \"young\" (underdeveloped). My gimlet was fine, and didn't cost much ($7), but it took 4 requests to 3 different staff before I got the glass of water I wanted.  Menu was typical (pizza, burgers, sandwiches) but the calamari was done nicely and the portion generous."}
{"text":"Not so Good, fries burnt other half not cooked.burger wasn't anything to talk about 
Tuna salad was Nasty Tuna was spoiled but they made good on it. 
U be better getting McDonald's and little ceazers pizza"}
{"text":"Not to chab very clean good beers. I got the sampler 9 different beers all good not a bad beer in the  house check it out"}
{"text":"I love CBC.  Consistently good service, tasty beer, and yummy food.  Their IPA is my favorite.  There is plenty of booth seating for the restaurant downstairs, and a nice bar area upstairs (elevator available- we met an elderly gentleman who was unaware and had taken the stairs).  CBC used to have big game sliders- which was my favorite menu item, but I have been told they were removed from the menu. Still, plenty of delicious items to choose from.  I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small, generally cold, and sometimes pretty smoky but it's a great place to watch any Chicago sports teams. The food menu is pretty basic bar food. Prices are very reasonable & portions are large. I got chicken fingers tossed in hot sauce, served with blue cheese dressing & veggies. It was tasty...huge I couldn't finish it. My husband got a Chicago dog that he really enjoyed. They have their own microbrews that are pretty good too. Service is always great every time we go."}
{"text":"4 star pizza 3 star chicken wings. 4 star staff. Something different in downtown Las Vegas. Cozy bar upstairs. They'll treat you right."}
{"text":"Still a hidden gem that should not go in-noticed! And rumor has it that Bloody Mary Sundays are on the horizon 
Great Service Great Food Great Bartenders 
Awesome Staff
Amazing Food coming from the Kitchen"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite after seeing a movie nearby. Sat in the bar area, which surprisingly was not smoky (unlike many other bars in town). There were a few people playing slots, but it didn't seem like this place is driven by its gaming presence. 

In the past, I have not been that impressed with the beers here. I'm not sure if they've changed their recipes or their brew master, or if my tastes have changed, but my husband and I both enjoyed our selections: the Ramblin' Reck (amber ale) for him, and the IPA for me.

We weren't that hungry, so we split two orders of sliders: meatballs and buffalo chicken. Both were fine but underseasoned. Each was served with a sizable side of fries, which neither of us finished.

The rest of the menu seemed like typical bar fare -- burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches -- but I think I'll stick with the beer next time. See you for patio weather!"}
{"text":"Came for a private party. Who knew they had an upstairs?  Nice lil area with a full bar. They had an appetizer buffet set up for the party. I'm not big on fingers but theirs are so good! Might have to do my husbands party here."}
{"text":"As much as I love the pizza and the brew here, today the bar staff failed sorely at holding thier shift together.  We were super-happy to settle in to a bar seat and order the brown ale and chicago pizza.  17 minutes later, we still had no beer or water.  I know the pizza takes time and we were prepared for that. However, we watched the bar staff have internal drama while our hydration needs were overlooked.  Extremely poor form on the barstaffs' behalf. Enough to make my man want to walk out.  I had to support him.  As we walked away,  we got a 'thank you' from one of the bartenders who never made eye contact when we were looking for service, serveral minutes after the bartender who took our order---and never fullfilled it--stormed off into a back room."}
{"text":"I gave a mid rating only due to the fact that I only had alcohol & the place has a smoking section. First time here & the place is broken into a smoking & non smoking area seperated by a door. This is awesome for non smokers as they get to enjoy the bar & restuarant w/o the issue of smoke. The downfall is if you sit in the non smoking area there's no bar. I tend to want to sit at a bar because normally it's faster service & you can chat w/ the bartenders too.
We decided to go to the bar which is located in the smoking area, both. We chose the upstairs bar which is small about 8 seats total. There is a small table w/ lounge type chairs, about 6 in that same area. It was great because we got to interact w/ the bartender who was very tentative to us & all the other patrons as well. He even suggested a twist on an old classic. There is a small balcony which we got to step out to to grab some air.
We must have come at the right time because there was very little to no smoke around us. Either that or people were just being very respectful to the non smokers, which is hard to find at a place these days. The drinks were on point & we were never fully empty before the next round came. That's a sign of a good bartender. Solid place! Next time we will try the food!"}
{"text":"great stouts!!!!!!! Food is awesome, service so/so, place is clean, and has really cool decor. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"WOW!!! That was a amazing lunch

I ordered CHICKEN CORDON BLEU (Grilled Chicken Breast, Grilled Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese And Honey Mustard) and it was amazing for $10."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to patron this bar for happy hour after a friend's recommendation for after work drinks. We sat upstairs which is cozy and presents a dark, comfortable atmosphere where the bartender also serves the tables.

At first, the bartender was quite attentive until a group of friends arrived to visit him.  Suddenly it was as if we did not exist. The service became so poor I am tempted to never go back. 

In my opinion, this organization gets zero stars for service. The two stars that I have presented are strictly because the happy hour food was decent. Not great, but decent for the price."}
{"text":"We went here just looking for a quick bite to eat and turned out to be some of the best and most affordable food we had while in Vegas. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Good food uplifts this place to the 4th star frontier. Probably just average brews, but their huge double-decker brewery flight and comparison to other local options, it is definitely worth a visit.  This was the fourth LV based brewey I visited, and my second favorite (second to Triple 7)

The double decker sampler tray comes with 9 samples:
*  Weizenheimer - regular Hef
*  Blueberry Hef - seasonal, different, but interesting flavor
*  All Nighter - light Ale tasty and easy drinking
*  Ramblin Reck Amber -yummy - my favorite
*  Hardway IPA - solid at 6.2% ABV
*  Black Widow Stout - not my fav. Too tart for a stout
*  Root beer very good
*  Black and Tan okay (mixture of the stout and All nighter)

I enjoyed the happy hour prices on the appetizers which included a pretty yummy 3 burger filet mignon slider."}
{"text":"Visited them while we were in LV for SEMA/AAPEX .. great pizza! Small place but service was spot on .. clean, couldn't really smell the smoke from the casino .. that's a plus for me!!
Check this place out
Craft beers are good, pizza is good .. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed some Chicago-style pizza, bread puffs, and stuffed mushrooms here.  I really enjoyed their house brewed beer."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this great little surprise find. My wife randomly saw a brewery mentioned on Yelp while we were wandering around Fremont and given that we were in the early stages of a challenge to try 100 new beers while on our US holiday, we dropped all other plans and headed straight here.

Chicago Brewing Co is tucked away at the back of the casino floor and if we weren't looking for it we would have completely missed it. We headed up the stairs and grabbed a table overlooking the floor for a spot of people watching and upon seeing they had a beer flight we promptly ordered one each. At first we wanted to order our drinks at the bar, but the bartender told us he was finishing his shift now and would send someone over to our table. He then proceeded to stand around talking for five minutes and playing around with his phone behind the bar before someone came to take our drinks order. They were taken by a very friendly waitress however and once ordered, the drinks came out very quickly.

The flight is huge. 9 beers (well..8 and a non alcoholic, but nonetheless tasty Root Beer) on a double decker tray made me very happy and glad the the car was staying put in the parking garage for another day. Now, it was a couple of months and a lot of drinks ago when we ordered here so I'll just pop in how I rated each beer on Untappd, because I really can't remember much of them.

All Nighter: 3/5
Weizenheimer: 4/5
Ramblin Reck: 3/5
Blueberry Vanilla Wheat: 3/5
Hardway IPA: 4/5
Old Town Brown: 4/5
Black and Tan: 4/5
Black Widow Stout: 4/5

I like my beers dark, so they were either really good to get that many 4's at the end or I was just getting drunk. Either way they were tasty and definitely worth stopping in for a try. 

Oh, and hit the toilets before you get into the bar. There aren't any inside and you have to walk all the way back across the casino floor to get to the closest ones."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in here for the first time and my girlfriend had a club sandwich and I had a steak sandwich witch was good. The service from Billy was great. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, having moved here from Chicago only a few months ago.  My first trip was my first night in town and we enjoyed the happy hour beer and food.

Unfortunately, my second trip tonight was somewhat disappointing.  The host was awesome and had a great attitude and smile, however when we got to our table the service was lacking in many ways. 

The tall guy (wont say his name out of respect) seemed like he was bored and freaked out by the 4 tables he had to wait on.  We returned our pizza twice to ask the to finish cooking it, I ask three times for ketchup for my fries, and he totally forgot our sweet potato fries and when I brought it to his attention he mumbled something and then walked off to the kitchen never to say another word about them.  Here is a clue \" I am sorry I forgot to put your order in\" would have been appropriate.

So...not sure what to make of this place, but I hope that if I decide to come again, the service and food steps up a notch or two

Gives Chicago a bad name....."}
{"text":"Not too crowded so it's perfect for watching sports games while enjoying appetizers with family members. Food is very underrated and is very delicious for a reasonable price. Good service and friendly people !"}
{"text":"Looking for a great tasting restaurant with a cheap price in Vegas? Look no further - Chicago Brewing Company is your place. Located in the Four Queens Casino in Fremont. Good pizza, good beer, good service. 

We started with some garlic knots which were greasy and great! We also tried the beer sampler (9 flavors), and then moved on to a pitcher of some type of Mango beer - really good. Last, we split a deep dish pizza (pepperoni & sausage). All delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A Vegas favorite. House brews are delicious. Deep dish pizza and blackened chicken quesadilla are a must. They have cigars on site if you're in the mood, too.

Love the atmosphere, helpings and prices.

Been dozens of times."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday (2/18) night around Midnight after our time at the Twenty One Pilots concerts for some late night food as we skipped dinner before the show. 

I was just getting over a cold and didn't really plan on having any alcohol (although I wish I could have) due to my horrible sore throat (that the concert made worse!) so I asked the server for some hot tea which completely confused him. 

I understand the restaurant portion was closed although they are open 24/7 but the fact they were completely out of hot tea overall was still confusing. They did offer me honey and lemon though but he never brought me a spoon so it was in the end just awkward hot water but still helped. 

We split a pizza, pretzel nuggets and garlic knots and for being bar food it was actually quite excellent. Maybe we were just starving but even the leftover the next day were still good!

Just stock up on hot tea guys...sometimes a girl needs a midnight tea ;)"}
{"text":"My dearly beloved Chicago's! What happened! You removed two staple items from your menu - the Caesar Wrap and the Rueben Sandwich. As a CA resident that frequents your bar on a bi-monthly basis I was saddened to learn this. Your service and appetizers are still great but please listen to the customers and your staff and bring back these two staple menu items. You Caesar wrap is tastier than any other. Don't ever change!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot to grab a bite and beer while staying in Vegas. All food is good and the prices are good too. For beers they have around 6 fine examples on tap. Solid and underrated in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to go and eat. If you want to have the best time, you have got to make sure to ask for Austin as your server. Such great service & very genuine! Out of all times I have been he has given the best service leaving me no choice but to leave this review!"}
{"text":"We like coming to Chicago Brewing. 

Staff: The staff is always great!very friendly and helpful.

Drinks: Drinks during happy hour are dirt cheap! 

Food: Food here is good! I recommend the Pizza or Chicken Fingers. Food used to be cheap during happy hour, but not so much anymore. 

Venue/Atmosphere: Nice setup. There's multiple areas to sit, including an outside patio. 

We have never had a bad experience here. 

Only gave this review 4 stars because to food prices, during happy hour, went up. 

Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"We were starving when we arrived here so we checked this out since we love breweries. Pretty good IPA I must say, the food was delish as well."}
{"text":"The beers are great! So are the sliders and garlic knots. My husband and I stopped in for lunch. The staff is super friendly also."}
{"text":"Great patio seating for afternoon dining- shaded with a barrier to muffle the traffic noise and block exhaust fumes, as well as lights for evening hours.

Service was dismal- saw signage advertising their lunch special and ordered it, was not told about it by our server. Other than being super cute and taking our order, then later bringing our check, didn't see much of our server as other staff brought out our food and we were not asked how we liked it until it was nearly gone. Initially intended to ask for ketchup but never saw anyone to ask. Seemed like we may have been a bit forgotten on the back patio.

Ordered the lunch special of a ham and cheese melt with a cup of the soup of the day- cream of mushroom. Sandwich was a good value with tons of ham- a bit salty for my liking but like I said, good value. Soup was very tasty and smooth, with good flavor. Added a side of onion rings, which was about ten rings for $3- perfectly crisp in beer batter, did not fall apart while eating.

My guy had the 10 piece hot wings with a cup of chili- wings were not hot but had good flavor and were a large size, priced well at $10 for the order coming out to a dollar a wing. Would come back for these wings despite lack of heat, wish they offered more sauces. Chili was also good quality- meaty with a few kidney beans, topped with green onions and cheese. Beer used in cooking was clearly eviden in the flavor of the dish itself.

My office occasionally has happy hour meetups here, and after experiencing the food I'll have to attend next time. Highly recommend the soups to order, and patio seating for dining and enjoying the weather."}
{"text":"Great place!   We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had to stop in and try their brews while in Las Vegas, right? In the far back corner, up some dark stairs in the Four Queens casino is a divey and smokey brewpub that hit the spot! We got a full sampler, including their Root Beer and recent GABF award winner. They were all pretty tasty as I recall.

The dark pub had screens with sports, video gambling on the bar and a few other tables where large groups were dining. The service was great and the vibe was relaxing. My only criticism is that there was no way to remember which beer was which. They were served and pointed out, but remembering which is what of about 10 samples was a little challenging.

Otherwise, this place was great & I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"we moved to vegas a year ago and this our favorite deep dish pizza place.  The deep dish pizza is very good.  The beer is fair.  The serivice is good but it takes forever. We like to order out.  Everyone that visits loves the pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The beer was great. Enjoyed the whole experience and the server was on his game. All-in-all, the food, the service and the atmosphere was great. Will come again."}
{"text":"Came here to watch Cubs playoff, game one against the Dodgers. They pride themselves in being a Chicago sports bar. Well, apparently not. They closed off the loft bar until 6:00 pm for a BABY shower of all things. I guess so the mother-to-be and baby can inhale cigarette smoke and drink. What where they thinking. Really!!!! Oh wait they weren't. One more thing, the downstairs bar they will not put the volume on for the game!!!!!! They should be re-named to Gamblers brewery. That's who they cater to."}
{"text":"Garlic knots, kids menu and the service are great here. That's the easy stuff but I have a hard time with this place calling themselves Chicago Brewing Company when their deep dish pizza doesn't represent the city they claim to be influenced by.  I may be spoiled by Gino's East in Chicago but true deep dish should have stacked toppings and not just a big piece bread with a sprinkle of topping and a little sauce.  What's even more insulting is that they charge $14 for the 9\".  No plans of coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"The downtown location is small but the beer is awesome.  When we went few weeks ago the seasonal beer was a blueberry vanilla wheat beer.  Man it was good!  My father-in-law had the sampler and all the beers were very tasty.  I REALLY enjoyed the hot wings and the deep dish pizza.  Will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Live down the street from this place and have been wanting to try it for years now, especially being from Chicago. It's a lot smaller than I anticipated I guess I thought it was going to look more like yardhouse on the inside. Menu isn't too big. We started with the brew house fries and the 10in pizza from happy hour. The portions were so big I couldn't order an entree so I just got a side salad which was also large. My husband got the south side cheese steak. We also got the sampler of all nine special beers they had going on. And the large glass on the table you can buy for $10 and pay an extra $5 to have them fill it up! 50oz of IPA and we get to get the glass sounds like a deal to me! Service was very friendly. Will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"So, we decided to stop in for a bite to eat, my husband had been here before years back and experienced good appetizers and beer. A lot must have changed because the food was simply the opposite. When we walked in the host was very helpful informing us that one of the areas offered happy hour and we decided to take advantage. We ordered garlic knots and 6 huge and very appealing knots were presented. I love bread however after just eating one of these knots I was already OD(over doughed) we then ordered Fillet Mignon sliders served with au jus and that proved to be straight up maggi seasoning, the meat itself was decent but the buns were just cold strait out of the bag slapped on, then came out a cracker like and overly salted pizza and as if we did not have enough awfulness we decided to ordered their highly recommended freshly baked brownie but that turned out to be freshly over baked almost burnt brownie with a low quality scoop of imitation vanilla ice cream. Perhaps the real chef called out that day, but its hard to say if we will be back for take II"}
{"text":"I have been a weekly regular at Chicago in the upstairs Cigar Bar. This is by far my favorite place to relax, smoke a cigar and watch a game on the many TV's. There is comfortable seating, good selection of their own craft beer and good whiskey to accompany a fine smoke. The food selection is great with the best Chicken tenders in town. But what really separates Chicago is the staff. The bartenders including Brad do a great job and will remember your drink after coming here just once. Frank site Manager and Nick the Operations Manager for the Group are frequently on site to make sure the experience is perfect. I highly recommend that this become one of your Go To Places!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because La Comida closed earlier then they advertise (boo). I wasn't really in the mood for pizza, but hot damn, this was really good! I was really surprised to see a line forming outside of that other 24/7 place inside 4 Queens. I have eaten their before, just typical late night menu. But anyhow, went in to the Chicago Brewery and ordered the white pizza and their lightest IPA. The place was dead, which shocked me cause the food was so gooood! Delicious and super cheap! They are open until 1:30am every night and since I am a night owl, I will be back!"}
{"text":"A glance from outside reminded me of a speakeasy from the 1920s area in Chicago.  Not that I'm that old, but it looks like something from Boardwalk Empire.  
As I entered, the front waiting area was filled with a pungent aroma of cigar smoke mixed with hookah tobacco.  I immediately noticed the size of brewing vats, bigger than hip -hop, to the right as we were led to our table.  The smell of smoke dissipated as we neared our table until it was only the smell of pizza fresh from the oven.  

The waiter was pretty awesome, no complaints about the staff at all.   We ordered a 2 pitchers of the sweet nectar known as beer.  The Weizenheimer came in a pitcher that looked like sweet golden honey, but upon tasting it we realized something had gone horribly wrong with the beer.  The beer tasted like Juicy Fruit Bubblegum, bleeehhh!  We set this one aside and poured out attention into the Ramblin' Reck Amber Ale.  Mmmm, the amber ale was a tasty brew!  

I ordered a BBQ burger which was surprisingly dry and the BBQ sauce burned my lips like hot lava from Mt. Vesuvius!   I waited for it to cool down slightly while focusing on my fries which weren't bad and went deliciously with the fine ketchup they had available.  

I would visit this place again, but I would definitely avoid the wheat beer like the plague.  How this beer won awards in 2004 boggles my mind like an enigma wrapped in duct tape so much that you can't even tell what it is anymore.  3 stars for gross beer and dry burgers."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was really good. We have gone back 3 times now. Pizza is top notch.  Portions are perfect. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is just good. I have been twice now and regret not eating here sooner. I have only been in the dining area so I can't speak for the rest of the place, but apparently there is a beer garden, cigar room, full bar and outdoor seating. 

my fellow yelper buddy, Ethan Z., has been trying out some pastrami sandwiches in my honor. I decided to try out the pastrami sandwich here just for him! Too bad he couldn't be here to taste it because it was damn good. I also tried a chili cheese dog that was very good. The dog had homemade beer chili, cheese and green onions on it. The dog came with a side of fries that were good especially dipped in their homemade ranch. I would order both again and probably will.

The service here is great and the servers checked on us often."}
{"text":"I love this place! First of all, the bartender Jason is AMAZING! He's at the upstairs bar and really knows how to please his customers with the best mixed drinks this side of LA. The reason for only 4 stars has  to do with their selection of highly requested liquors. They really need to get on board with Crown Royal's Apple  and Deep Eddy's Vodka. The food is good too from what I've had but the atmosphere is worth it all. Throw caution to the wind and enjoy the several outdoor areas to enjoy the air or stay inside and enjoy the great ambience!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere upstairs and downstairs options, food is good but needs more options to choose from.  Pizza excellent.  Beer lots of options but not to impressed most tastes watered down nothing that makes me want to come back for another.  Overall staff and service excellent."}
{"text":"WOW. James and his awesome bartender, Chris, helped me pull off a great 50th surprise birthday party for my husband on May 19. The food, drinks, and service were fabulous. James and I coordinated about 4 weeks in advance, and I was allowed early access to the location to decorate and to bring in a cake (which the downstairs bartender was kind enough to place in the fridge until the party began). I was impressed that Chris kept up with our demanding crowd of 20, but he was right on point. Looking forward to returning again soon. Thanks James and Chris--you two rock!"}
{"text":"The beer is good enough to provide you with a set of goggles for the evening. The food is subpar and nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is cool. Bottom line, stick to bottoms up and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Casual atmospher. Open 24 hours. Craft Brews on tap as well as a large selection of bottles. I'd like to try the good next time I come. They also have a cocktail / cigar bar upstairs that I'd also like to check out sometime. Over all I liked it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I come often because it's a block away. If i have to walk, i will. Their house beer offerings have never really impressed me, but the food is really good. The king salmon dinner, the caprese salad, all amazing. 
Just recently I tried the blackberry wheat and Hopocalypse which were both incredible to me. The rest of the beer has been just ok. I know i'll be back again,lol

PS: no more late night happy hour :("}
{"text":"Pros:
1. Friendly staff
2. Clean place
Cons: 
1. Warm beer
2. No vodka in my cranberry vodka
3. Very bland garlic knots 
4. Super greasy, making bread soggy
5. Horrible stomach ache"}
{"text":"I think worse than getting mediocre food is getting mediocre food from a place that you've really enjoyed.  Thwarted expectations are disappointing.  I've eaten at the Chicago Brewing Co. outlet in the 4 Queens downtown.  This was my first visit to their full restaurant / brewery.  The beer, as always, was good, but the food was not.  I started with an enchilada soup that was okay.  Then I got a pizza.  There was something wrong with the crust.  First, it was under-done, but more, it was like a biscuit dough, not a bread/pizza dough.  A really strange consistency.  I've always enjoyed their pizzas downtown, this was not that.  Their topping was heavy on cheese, light on meats."}
{"text":"My favorite place downtown.  Great pizza (we've only done their thin crust).  Good to great appetizers.  Excellent beer.  And an outstanding root beer (I can't think of better).

Friendly place with a friendly (hustling) staff.  They will accommodate groups.  A don't-miss Happy Hour.  They'll validate your parking.  It's 4 1/2 stars.  A little dark, and a little small to come up with the fifth star."}
{"text":"We ALWAYS eat here when hitting up Freemont St and now our nephew/younger cousins hit it up as well. The garlic knots are great and even with 5 of us (4 being big time guy eaters!) we can get by with sharing the knots and 2 large pizzas! Where else can you feed 5 and get a few pitchers for under $100! Definitely a hidden gem tucked up in the corner of Four Queens!"}
{"text":"Our party ordered burgers, chicken strips and pizzas. All of it was DELICIOUS! The service was fast and very friendly.. Food was great quality for the price! Would definitely go here again if we weren't from Washington! Highly suggested :)"}
{"text":"So, our first time to Chicago Brewery. As you walk into the place, you are overwhelmed with the cigar smell from their cigar lounge. We get seated in a booth and asked for what kind of drinks we would like. I ordered  a cup of coffee and my husband ordered an ice tea. When the drinks arrived, there was no sugar and no spoon to stir with. When we asked for sugar, they bring us sweetner. The waitress stated that they don't have sugar, but we have raw sugar. Really. Next we ordered the calamari, pretzel bites, and the molten chocolate a la mode. And of course, the calamari was like chewing on a rubber band. So as you can see, the service sucks, and the food is not that great. My opinion, if try all their beers, maybe you'll forget about the service and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Pizza is thin crust and delicious!  The quesadilla was the best I ever had. Blonde ale was yummy and service was great!"}
{"text":"First off this place had the best food! The garlic knots are the shiz. Pizzas as well! Not to mention brews on brews! I love the heff w/ an orange! The only thing about Chicagos that sucks is the vibe. It's just a regular bar, cool but nothing special. Quality wise Chicagos has the upper hand though over mainstream bars like PT's. if you're looking for custom brews and some serious bar food Chicagos is your place! If you're looking for something high class and date worthy it's definitely not going to knock the socks off your potential mate. Four stars."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly bartenders/servers.   Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving them just three stars because their happy hour menu used to have way better deals. Otherwise though the beer and food are great."}
{"text":"Sliders! Sliders! Sliders! They are a must! Filet mignon sliders- probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. Everything about this place is awesome. The staff is super friendly. I like how it overlooks the casino. The beer is great! Can't go wrong here. The reason for 4 stars- we also ordered the Chicago deep dish. There was way tooooooo much cheese! I wasn't sure if I was cutting into soggy crust or cheese. It was definitely cheese. Crust was almost absent besides the huge pieces at the edge. I've eaten deep dish from Chicago so I guess I had my standards pretty high. I was pretty full off of sharing an order of sliders so it wasn't too disappointing. Also, this is a cigar lounge so if you would be bothered by cigar smell/smoke, I suggest getting the sliders to go!"}
{"text":"The menu looks delicious, but I'll never get to taste what's on it because I will never go here again. My two friends and I waited for 20 minutes and never got served, so we left. The staff didn't walk over to our table even once. There was one table across the way with guests who had finished their meals, and there were two men seated at the bar. They also waited and did not get greeted or served, so they left.


We were nicely dressed, friendly, and smiling. We did not deserve to be ignored like that.  

Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I thought I was coming back to update my review.. just to find out I hadnt reviewd this place, what?!

Its a small spot but very comfy sofas and a few TVs to watch sports, excellent beer and even better chicken wings (they are enormous and delicious)

My own little secret corner @ the 4 queens....ah!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place many times! 
Usually come there after a long day at work for a dinner and some drinks. 
The staff is definitely nice. The food there is pretty amazing. I have always enjoyed the food that I ordered from them. 
Also they got a pretty nice selection of beers. As I am personally not a beer person, they always have choices that work for me, that do not taste like beer. 
Not sure what that place is like during the day, but later at night it is a pretty great environment."}
{"text":"Where to start? Beer was not good. Focacia bread was not focacia it was a hamburger bun. Not bad...just not what was on the menu description for my sandwich. Mushrooms on the pizza were canned...yuck. Oh yeah, can't forget the lady vomiting at the table next to us. Other than the above, everything was just dandy."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Chicago, this place was not even close....not even New York slices are like this....I went off the beaten path and I shooouldnt have done that...the food was terrible the service was lousy and atmosphere is too smokey it was definitely a dive bar with make up so if that's ur kinda party I know a spot"}
{"text":"We love the chicken tenders tossed in their hot sauce. The Chicago style pizza is very good too  be sure and enjoy it with one of their own brewed beers. They have draft root beer for the kiddos."}
{"text":"I love the smell of cigars, so I can get my fix upstairs. But at the downstairs bar you'd never know. The delicious fragrance of a nice cigar stays upstairs. Great, diverse menu! Several choices of places to eat, a bar upstairs, a bar on ground floor, at a table."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have eaten at the both the bar and restaurant. The servers are great in the restaurant area, but I will pick the bar every time. The bartenders there are amazing. I love them all, ESPECIALLY Michelle. She remembered what i drink after my first time meeting her and on my second visit, she promptly had it ready for me within a minute of  walking through the door.  There were some rude customers when i was there last but her ability to handle nasty people was nothing short of a super power. Coming from NY i know attitude, and the bartenders back home would of just pointed to the door.  Now for the food, it's super yummy. I've sampled a few things from their menu, the calamari, ahi salad, and clam chowder are all on my favorites list. The chicken sandwich, spinach artichoke dip, and garlic knots are some of the best \"drunk food\" you can get. The atmosphere is great. Lots of room and enough tables in the bar area so non gamers and non smokers don't have to sit next to a cigarette while they're eating, even though its very well ventilated. Their machines kick a$$ too. I've began to make this place a weekly ritual. Kudos guys!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant many times because it's near my school. The place is usually quiet even when it's busy, and the food is typical bar food, maybe a step above on certain menu items. 

I'm giving this review because during the two years I've eaten here, the service has never been great. There is no shortage of staff walking around, but even when it's dead inside the service is incredibly slow and lacking. Tonight I stood by the entrance waiting for help for three minutes while the staff wandered about taking to each other, and when the hostess finally walked up to greet me, she wasn't pleasant. 

I ordered the meatball sliders, which are pretty tasty, and a side of fries. I'm pleased with the taste and presentation of the food and I'm sad to have to give this place a bad review because the hostesses & servers seem busy socializing when they should be working.

Also, was it so hard to offer or give me ketchup or napkins for my fries on a to-go order?"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and I've had the cheesesteak two other times and it's very good it's big enough to split with someone if your not extremely hungry.. my last visit I had pizza and beer and it was such a good decision , the pizza was sooooooo good you can tell all the ingredients are fresh and prepped on site which I can truly appreciate.. The beer we had read really good too.. I will definitely be coming back to this place.. our waiter Rob was nice and had a lot of knowledge about the beers and helped me choose one that would be in my liking and he was so spot on with that.. totally recommend this place plus they are open 24hrs can't beat that & offer two happy hours mid day & late evenings which are always my favorite.."}
{"text":"Had a meeting over drinks ... My favorite kind LOL
While at the bar.. My girl decides to play Keno on the machine and hit it 6 times ! i couldnt believe it , she won $1000 ! Female bartender was great !!!"}
{"text":"Beer is fine. Food is fine if limited in selection.  Service is what kills it.

The chicken tenders are meh, cooked just fine but utterly flavourless although the bbq sauce is solid if a bit sweet for my tastes.  The garlic knots are good but the pizza dipping sauce tastes funny.

Service was sooooooo slow. Bar was moderately filled and dining room was empty and everything took an eternity.  Getting seated, drink order delivery, food order taking, food delivery, everything.  There were over 12 staff on the floor and only one seemed to do anything and then only half the time.  She was friendly enough just absent.

No reason to come back especially with better in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this locations and it exceeded my expectations.
I took my parents here. It was their first time in Vegas.

When we told the server we were celebrating and ordered a scotch, he brought me more than a double. Food and drinks came out quickly. Everything was perfect. I could hardly tell that I was downtown and not at the Summerlin location.


It made me look good for choosing such a fantastic restaurant to celebrate with my parents."}
{"text":"Great pizza and really great Garlic Knots. Big and garlicky, took some home. The beer is so good. Try sampler, every beer was great. They also make their own Rootbeer."}
{"text":"Garlic Knots were good.  We tried based on prior yelp review.  Prices were actually decent for Vegas, but it's Fremont St so all the food is cheaper down there.  Waitress screwed up the order.  She didn't write it down so I was not confident she'd get it right... We both got burgers.  1/4 lb which is what I prefer.  The more toppings you put on it, the more it costs you."}
{"text":"So, this place is GOOD! The pizza was phenomenal! Lots and LOTS of cheese. And had a really good flavor. The cheese they use on the French onion soup was incredible. The garlic knots sans sesame seeds are yum! Too bad I really don't like beer. The friends I was with raved and raved  about this seasonal blueberry beer.  Service was exceptional. Thanks Alex."}
{"text":"Excellent Beer and appetizers and service. I highly recommend for tapas, good beer and cigars during happy hours. The calamari was excellent and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I was charged $25 for Mediocre Pizza and when I asked the bartender why it was so expensive she told me to go to little ceasars if I want cheap Pizza. Wow. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Unusual combination of a pizzeria and cigar lounge happening at the same time. You can smoke a stogie while eating and drinking while gazing down at the casino crowd trying lady luck.
Just ate a huge salad slathered in a creamy garlic sauce , then a Chicago deep dish pizza all watered down with a pale craft beer. 
Stogie to follow."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from san diego so we love our beer, we ordered the deep dish and a flight perfect for two people. The food and beer were delicious and reasonably priced $9 for a flight. It's not on the menu so ask your server, the guy with the beard was very informative and on point very good service."}
{"text":"Mozzarella sticks were ok. The calamari was awful. Philly was awful. Maybe just stop here for a drink."}
{"text":"This is a review for their location inside the Four Queens.

It is in a small space on the second level, overlooking the casino. There are gaming machines at the bar and the bartender took good care of us while we were playing. My friend is a home brewer and he likes to try local micro brews when we travel. He likes the Triple 7 better, but I preferred Chicago Brew Co. Their All-Nighter was great and I ended up getting a growler of it to take back to my room."}
{"text":"Cool Brewery with good beers and they have the best deep dish pizza I have had outside of Chicago (the city) ever! Service is always top notch. They also have a cool upstairs sort of cigar lounge bar with a Touchtunes to play music."}
{"text":"Escaped the pricey places on the strip and ventured downtown with the hubby.

The beer is great. The Greek Salad is nothing special... mostly just a platter of lettuce with a few sliced tomatoes, olives, feta tossed on. Menu said it had cucumbers in it... but I couldn't find them. The dressing was fine. DH had the house salad and was fine with it. We shared the 9 inch Chicago 'style' pizza. Not truly a deep dish pizza... just a layer of cheese and pepperoni/sausage. It collapsed and ran cheese everywhere inside the screaming hot pan. It tasted pretty good. I just get a little annoyed when the menu description doesn't match the product. 

I'd go back for the beer and pizza knowing what I'm actually getting."}
{"text":"I don't know how it is possible to mess up a burger and fries, but they did. The fries were hard as rocks and the burger was still significantly raw, despite being ordered medium-well. Service was so slow - despite how empty the place was - that our meal took over 3 hours to complete. I got super sick after I got home, too, and it was just a bad experience altogether. I will never return, and I beg anyone reading this to not go, either."}
{"text":"The largest turn off about this place was the service. We were stoked on a brewing co, however, after waiting 20 minutes we actually had to go up and ask for help. It's really small. We had the IPA- the beer was great but unfiltered. I ordered chicken tenders, they were burnt, but other than that they would prob be good. My boyfriend got the Philly cheesesteak he wasn't impressed. My aunt got the filet mignon sliders and loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing bartenders and incredible happy hour with some great microbrews.  Love the All-nighter and all their crafted brews.

Great place to catch a game, and awesome setup to kick it with friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited this place after driving by it a couple of times while running errands. The huge Chicago sign outside of the attractive building is what drew our attention to it... then, of course, discovering that it was a nearby microbrew, well, how could we resist?

I love microbrews... and I enjoy trying them out from the different regions of the country. When we first sat down, we were greeted by a very knowledgeable waitress who helped us through the beer menu. We started our evening with the nine-beer sampler for $9. This gave us a chance to warm up to all of the local offerings. After working our way through them all, my wife and I both chose our favorites.

Next came the food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer. Sure, you've had this in other places, like your neighborhood chain restaurants, but this one takes the cake. It was a huge portion and the flavor was nothing short of spectacular. If you like spinach and artichoke, this appetizer must be on your list of things to get here.

We then looked over the good-sized menu. There was a decent amount of things to choose from, but given the name of the place, we were immediately drawn to the deep dish pizza. I mean, with a name like \"Chicago\" how can we go wrong with deep dish pizza?

We chose correctly!

The deep dish pizza was some of the best I have had, and unlike other places that specialize in this style of pizza, it arrived to the table a little faster than I expected, which gave it a little time to cool down, which was good, because it was piping hot when the waitress arrived with it.

The dough was perfect. The cheese was real and it was perfect. The sauce was homemade - and one of several you could choose from - and the pepperoni was spicy and plentiful. Definitely a good choice if you like deep dish.

We finished our food, drank our beers and the waitress cleaned out the pint glasses - which had the restaurant's logo on them - and we got to take them home with us.

If you're in this area of Las Vegas and you have a little time, I strongly recommend visiting this place... it'll fill you up and it won't set you back a whole lot of money either."}
{"text":"Ronika!!!!!! Is truly the best and because of her amazing service, we will be coming again. Chicago Brewing Co. you are lucky to have Ronika on your team! The food was delicious and your beer is tasty. We now have a regular hang out spot. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"This location of Chicago Brewing is my favorite.  Located upstairs in 4 Queens, when we stay downtown, this is a must stop for us.  From the cool starlit sky above, to the helpful  bar staff, video poker that allows me to play long enough on medium fundage, to the actual beverages they sell, 

The beer itself is very good, although it seems that I have locked on to the hefeweizen and IPA.  

Don't tell too many people because it is a small area and last time we went, I had to take my IPA downstairs just to find a place to play."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and always friendly service.  They offer 2.50 large beers and 6.00 personal size pizza during daily happy hour.  Great fresh brewed beer and decent pizza.  Lots of parking and a good atmosphere.  Only complaint is they dont have sound on for sports."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat in the later part of the evening. We had the garlic knots and chicken wings. They hit the spot for late night snack, but I am not sure if I would come here for dinner. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but didn't love it."}
{"text":"Their IPA is exquisite, and that's coming from someone who knows a good IPA. It's a combination of Sculpin and West Coast, refreshing, tasty and hoppy. Bar staff friendly and knowledgable. Only disappointment is that we were the only ones in the bar drinking beer!!!!!"}
{"text":"One thing of me being a social drinker is finding fantastic place to have me a cold one.  Where is a better place to go than an actual brewery.  I came to Chicago here at the 4 queens and even though I was in here for 30 minutes only I had one of the best dark stout beer ever.  Is call the Black Widow and I recommend this beer especially if your a dark beer drinker is delicious. tasty, amazing, orgasmic, and the best.  Oh yeah come on down and get freaky at Chicago.  I approve this message."}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood restaurant of all time! My favorite beer is their heff and they do have the best pizza in town. Have been coming here for almost 15 years. We always have the same server and he is very friendly. We almost ordered the same food every time when we are here and our server knows! Great for kids and family gathering!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour yesterday and didn't really go in with any expectations. 

Happy Hour
Prices were super awesome, $9/pitcher, which was perfect to split with my buddy. They also have a few $6 app choices like pizza and pretzel bites. Apparently they no longer have a late night happy hour which sucks for those who work til 12 on the strip.  

Service
Our bartender was Brad, who really makes you feel like you're a regular on your first visit. He was hilarious and you can tell he has quite the customer base that come back to visit. 

Atmosphere
What I like about this location is the three distinct experiences you can have. There is a gaming-bar area which would be somewhat similar to PTs, there is a restaurant as well which caters to more families I'm sure, but then there is the upstairs bar area which includes a cigar area. It's nice to have a bar you can sit at and not feel pressured to gamble at. 

Taste
The beers we had were super yummy. We did a pitcher of Hef and a light beer selection. The pizza was just alright but the other foods that people were ordering looked bomb. 

I will definitely go again! Just wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"The previous reviews are very accurate. This is a solid place to eat. We had a greek salad, root beer, garlic cheese knots, a small white pizza and a deep dish (only choice was with peperoni and sausage so I did not eat that). Everything was good. We were seated right away and our food came out pretty fast. There was left over pizza and garlic knots and those were even better the next day reheated! Nice casual place to grab a bite to eat downtown."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. I went for lunch and ordered a ginger ale and the cheesesteak with beer cheese and it was so hot and delicious. The fries were skinny and so tasty. But...the service was okay. We waited over half an hour for our drinks to come and i had to ASK  for a refill. Mind you, it wasn't busy (2 pm) and we were at the bar, there were 4 of us, so please do the math. And our food did not come at the same time. The guy waiter (he reminded me of Jordan Peele) was courteous, but he didn't seem like he wanted to be there. Other than that, this would've been a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Microbrews, bbq wings, patriots football. Forgot i was in vegas. Staff was fast, cigar bar a
in addition. pretty cool lil place."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant located in the Four Queens Casino.  It's open until about midnight.  The bar serves typical bar food.  The real draw is that it is a microbrewery that serves craft beer.  They have about 8 different beers and they vary by type, typical of a normal microbrew.  I got the IPA and I thought it was quite good.

The food was ok, but was served in large portions.  It's typical bar food such as pizza, sandwiches and fried appetizers.  The french fries are really good for some reason, I don't know why."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Great prices! Stopped for a late night dinner and was not disappointed at all. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After seeing the sights downtown we wandered into the 4 gueens for dinner and we ended up going to the Chicago brewing co because there was a very long at another restaurant on sight ,what a nice find it was ! Our waiter said they are known for their pizza , ( many restaurants have told me that over the years and been very average ) our waiter was right , we ordered a sandwich and a deep dish pizza and both were excellent ,especially the pizza ! And to top it off the bill came to less than $ 50 , ( pizza ,a sandwich and a few cocktails ) .Next time in Vegas we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  To be fair, I've only been here twice, a year apart and never \"really\" ate here.  I went last year on Halloween and dressed up.  It was great to see the staff and a lot of the patrons dressed up as well.  Sat at the bar with my girl and got some drinks.  Had an amazing blueberry vanilla beer which unfortunately is seasonal even though it is super popular.  I then asked for a daiquiri, a simple drink that anyone should be able to make.  The bartender had no idea though.  He asked what flavor I wanted and I said just a straight daiquiri, not frozen, not fruity.  He didn't know what to do so I told him the three ingredients, rum, simple syrup, and lime juice and he still told me he didn't know how to make it so I told him and he still refused to do it so I just grumpily ordered a beer.  That truly annoyed me.

I went again just last night and our bartender was polite and engaging, got me my beer and rum and coke, and our happy hour apps.  It was pleasant but nothing special.  

All in all to me, this place is just alright and has no reason to stand above other similar places except maybe for it's decor.  I suppose I should try more food though before I put too many judgments."}
{"text":"We LOVE their pizza! We get it downtown all of the time so we tried the HQ. We sat at the bar and WOW they couldn't care less that we were there! This is an old people gaming bar so they don't need our measly beer and pizza money. I put in a $20 but that's small potatoes here, I guess. They didn't take our order, they were short with us and the SECOND I cashed out, they through down the \"reserved for gamers\" sign on my machine. I'm sure they won't even care about this review. Why would they? The staff is getting tipped from all of the old gamers... Who are we?

The location in the Four Queens is closer anyway."}
{"text":"The four stars are for the beer. Mr Cormier is a true craftsmen. The wife and I thought the food was unremarkable and somewhat bland. the service was fine."}
{"text":"Used to be good. Horrible service food has gone way down hill. Been coming here for 20 years must be new management last few times it's gotten worse think I'm done, too bad."}
{"text":"I think Chicago Brewery gets it every time.  Well, I've been there twice since moving here.  Great wait staff Mia) I believe, always has a smile and happy and kind.  Food always really good from chicken ceased, filet migon sliders and pizza..."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in the Four Queens Casino on Fremont Street in downtown Vegas. The Chicago-style deep dish is amazing....lots of sauce, sausage & pepperoni....holy crap it's awesome!

They also have a very delicious (but small) selection of microbrewed beers that are very good as well! I cannot believe that, in all the times I've been to Vegas (my wife and I go a few times a year and always stay downtown) that I only experienced this place for the first time last week (NYE 2010). Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love going to Chicago Brewing Company and have been a return customer there for more than 2 years now.  Although the parking lot looks crowded during peak sport seasons, if you're just popping in to eat in the dining room- it's not crowded at all!  (Everyone else goes upstairs to watch the game.)  I have not tried the adventurous side of their menu, but I can vouch for their philly, fries and chicken fingers.  Members of my family have ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with ghost pepper sauce, and they love it (at least, I'm assuming the tears rolling down their cheeks are tear of joy with each bite...)  Customer service is always on point here.  Oh and be sure to try their root beer!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I come here for my Iceacholics fantasy football drafts but this year decided too add fantasy hockey too draft night at Chicago Brewing Co. One of teammates gets us the hook up if weather permits we get a reserve section out in the beer garden area (they only run that during the summer months) just did it inside since too cold. We were upstairs bar area. Part of the restaurant that most people don't know about but lot more spacious then the downstairs bar area. It carpeted upstairs, the lounge chairs lot more comfortable (downstairs more stand up bar stool/chair), and even have little arcade type area have golden tee and couple other games.  Watching any games have more then enough televisions upstairs or downstairs. They do also sell cigars if in the mood for stogie and cognac. The restaurant area not all that big but have ample amount of booths and tables too choose from. It interesting setup since you literally have three different area can hang out at! 

They do have great prices for HH. It been while since came here for HH. The beer here is delicious! Every time I keep coming love mixing up my brews from darker stouts too lighter ales. I know not many brewery in Vegas but feel Chicago Brewing Company Brew the best craft beers in Vegas. They mix it up from time too time and they do seasonal beers all the time.

The food I order the Italian Beef Sandwich. I believe it first time ordered this sandwich and why not ordered it sooner. Not that I had problem with any of there sliders (they have few too choose from) I love! Especially if put some Ghost sauce on the sliders or just about anything goes well. The KEY is NOT ON THE MENU.......So if want too get kicked by some SERIOUS heat just have ask the server for some Ghost sauce. We got some last night. Italian Beef Sandwich had so much flavor no need too kick it up. The pickled jalapenos, roasted bell peppers, onions, and something else all combine put on top of the sandwich. You have cup of au jus dip it in. So good!! The fries nothing special skinny cut fries. Even if nothing special refreshing basic fries come out hot and well seasoned. Sure this sandwich would order again and again."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  In passing someone overheard my husband and I chatting about wanting pizza for supper..... he recommended Chicago Brewing (said he had been in Vegas 2 days and had already eaten there 3 times).  GREAT recommendation!  Service was second to none, as well as the pizza!!!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Well , 
   This place shares a menu with another place on the property so some stuff is made there and other stuff like the muffuletta is made somewhere else and brought up . The muffuletta was so so . Definitely not a muffuletta   not what you may be expecting if you are from nawlins . 
   But the steak sliders are really great . They are made on site.  I hate sliders because of the ratio of meat to bread . But these things are tasty and more meat then bread . Plus the 9 beers for nine bucks is a great deal . ( yep its a sampler but a big sampler )  
I would like the management to ditch the menu items they do not make in house and do what they can do best ."}
{"text":"Tough review only because I LOVE LOVE the real location on Sahara. I understand this location is basically tiny restaurant tucked upstairs in one corner of The Four Queens. So not much you can do. Truth the food, micro brews, and the service is fabulous. Right on point and more important consistent with the Sahara location. Just walking into the The Four Queens if your not going Hugo Cellar is like why am I even this is old dump of hotel. So kind of kills the vibe for me. Once you get upstairs the place is so tiny, hell of low ceiling, and kind of feel trapped in box with lack of places to move around in general. The times I have come only because had visitors from out of town staying downtown. Now that downtown has evolved then more then just hotels. Bars, Restaurant, and Banger Brewery competition lot more tough. Chicago Brewery falls in the OK category. 

The beer is the same craft beer get at the other location. I really like all of them. The food just ordered appetizers order of garlic knots and mozzarella sticks. The garlic knots love at Chicago Brewery. The knots always hot, moist, nice golden brown crust, and the marinara sauce dip them in brings it all together. The mozzarella stick was ok. Just your normal bar food  not something would recommend if looking for munchies while watching football games. Our server was on it the whole time."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!!! Have you tried the Pizzas???? If you havent, you're doing yourself a GREAT disservice! The pizzas and food in this establishment are amazing (the 4 Queens location too). The Service here is attentive, but the service at the other location inside the 4 Queens is the opposite. You need a neon sign around your neck saying \"Help me\" over there!"}
{"text":"Horrible service/borderline racists. Sat down today 01/12/18 around 6:50pm waitress and mgr on duty see us sitting waiting for help. We wave to the waitress and she goes to a table where the people had just walked in ignoring us. Tell the mgr and he says \"oh she probably didn't see you\" although they both seen us sitting there.
Really sucks cause I've been waiting to try this place. After that, will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just like Ty Murray, I found this little \"Jewel\" on the Northwest side of Las Vegas, just East of Red Rock Casino. 

And started thinking when I walked in, \"You were meant for me...\" (yeah, lousy Jewel reference).

There's a dining room (remember, in Vegas you can still smoke in the bar areas), a bar and a secret loft cigar bar with a fireplace and an outside beer patio. Honestly, being a non-smoker, the air in the bar was fine.

This is an eatery that brews beer, and brew master David Pascual has won numerous awards (well, the beers have) . There's a great assortment, I tried the IPA and the creamy Black Star Stout. The IPA is on the lighter side, a tad hoppy, not too bitter and not over whelming. They offer short mugs, 22oz mugs, the 50oz Brewtus, Pitchers, Growlers and the Brewzooka's (oh my).

You're my boy Blue!
Well, maybe not.

I ordered the Black & Blue Sliders. A compact set of three each equipped with a black angus patty dusted with cajun spice, loaded with caramelized onions and a microcosm of blue cheese crumbles.

The caramelized onions were delicious, but extremely over powering. I looked, searched, opened and anticipated a burst of blue cheese, but sadly found just a smidgen, a dot, barely a hint of that penicillin-added mold culture we know as blue cheese.  

Just rename the thing the Caramelized Onion Slider, don't tease us with Cajun Spices or Blue Cheese...or better yet, offer a side of Blue Cheese- and for goodness sake, spell it BLEU Cheese.

Friendly service, the bar is loaded with video poker, so sitting at the rail is tough. The high back tables in the bar area are comfortable and it's not too loud, bright or over powering with smoke."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood dive bar. Brad is a great bartender and the food is delicious. We like to hang out upstairs, though it's usually smoky. Chicago's 24/7 is perfect for after-work drinks! 

As far as food goes, you can't go wrong with: Philly cheesesteak, spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings, fries, garlic knots, sweet potato fries. I have yet to try more, but I'd be willing to bet money that everything is good."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been here in years.  The previous time the beer was average at best.  I was very surprise on how nice the brews have come along.  I only had the Red and the IPA.  But both were ver good.  I was disappointed that I could only get the IPA in a pint and not the 22 oz.  The food was above average bar food.  the bartender was kind of stand offish but nice when she came around (sidenote...she is/was pregnent so I have to assume it would be hard to be in the  work mood)"}
{"text":"Located in the Four Queens casino it's a nice respite from walking around downtown. The beers are middle of the road for each style....that's not a knock on them...they are what you expect for each style...nothing that pushes any boundries. Food wise it's solid as well, with pizza,burgers etc...a good pub menu and a good value for what you get."}
{"text":"We went to Chicago Brewing Company last weekend at my wife's suggestion.

We started with a bowl of clam chowder. The presentation was nice and had a fresh clam shell on the side of the bowl. The taste was okay but had a little too much pepper and more vegetables than I care for in my clam chowder.

We both got one of their micro-brews to drink. I ordered the Weizenheimer which is their hefeweizen. My wife got the black widow stout. Both were decent though we both preferred the beer the other ordered so we swapped.

For our entree we split the wild game sliders combo plate. It consisted of six different sliders: alligator, antelope, bison, rabbit, jackelope (antelope and rabbit), and wild boar. I was really excited to try all the different types of game but was underwhelmed. 

The alligator tasted like seasoned salt and cumin and was a little heavy on the spices. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.

The antelope was really dry and I had to choke it down. It had a licorice/anise taste to it.

The bison and jackelope sliders were also dry and not particularly memorable.

The rabbit had a very mild taste and wasn't as dry as some of the others.

The wild boar was my favorite. It was a little dry but the meat had a nice taste and wasn't masked by spices.

The sliders had animal toothpicks in them labeling what kind of meat they were which was a nice/cute touch.

The sliders were served with waffle-cut sweet potato fries. They were pretty good and not too sweet.

Not sure if I'll go back. If I do, I'm gonna try something else."}
{"text":"Chicagos isn't quite what it use to be but still a great place! 

First, they don't have the celery salad any more! It was so good! Second, the servers just aren't what they use to be. Yea, I don't regular this place like I use to but at once a week, at least, you'd think they'd start remembering their regulars, after all they tip better. There are very few servers that are still there and still don't recall us. But the service isn't the worst and most will check on you before HH is over, big bonus. 

The HH is still the best at $6 a pitcher for craft local beer! The food portion is yet to catch up or rather has fell behind, it use to be way better. But alas it is still the best place to sit on the patio and have a beer. 

Recently, we were told the patio was closed due to damage to the patio wall. A couple times we checked in on the status of the patio being open, it's the best place to air and the perfect weather!, each time however getting various degrees of confused looks and responses. But yet there were people seen on the patio on a couple nights when I drove by. Seemed there was a major miscommunication on the situation? Weird, Chi-brew lost our business several times during that period. On the last try we called ahead, I didn't make the phone call but Traci T said they talked to her like she asked them if they served beer. 'Duh our patios open.  But I was excited! When we got there the wall was damaged but if I hadn't of know I wouldn't have know, ya know! ;)

Visit Chi-brew, it's a great local place!"}
{"text":"The service was great but, the food and atmosphere (restaurant side) were mediocre. I had a philly cheese steak & my husband had a hamburger.  I didn't get any feelings that made me want to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Please save yourself the money!
To get started when we first walked in the place looked dingy, carpets looked like they havent been vacumed in days. We ordered the sampler ... The beer was warm... As far as the pizza ... I have had better frozen pizza ... It came out kinda burnt and was just gross... I only ate one slice ... Service is ok .. As a avid pizza eater I would recomend to skip it. So disapointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out a few days ago and weren't impressed with the food. He didn't really like their American Amber? I don't drink beer, but I think that's what he called it. He liked their hefeweizen, though.

For an appetizer, we got the steakhouse fries. The menu said it was topped with beer cheese and I'm not a huge fan of beer, but we tried it anyway. I didn't like it much, but it was all right. I probably wouldn't order them again, but if my boyfriend wanted to, I'd munch on the fries on the bottom that didn't have much (or any) cheese on them, which is what I did that day.

We both tried the country fried filet mignon. I didn't really like the mashed potatoes -- they were sour for some reason. I've had mashed potatoes like that and I'm not sure what it is in them that makes it taste that way, but I don't like it much. The meat was kinda tough and dry; the fried batter just fell right off. I just felt like I was eating a kind of dry steak and some chips.

As for service, the staff was nice. However, we got the wrong drinks three times. We had a guy that was in training as our server, but I don't blame him for this. The first time, my boyfriend ordered I think a 16oz beer, but the bartender poured him a 20z, which he said was fine. Then a waitress refilled my raspberry iced tea with unsweetened iced tea. I let our server know what happened and he got me a refill of the right drink. Lastly, my boyfriend was trying to ask our server for the hefeweizen before he walked away; however, he had already swiftly walked out of earshot. The busser was handing us our plates of food and heard my boyfriend, so he said he'd send the server back our way. The server was nice enough to return with a beer, but it was a refill of the same beer. I'm guessing the busser just told him my boyfriend wanted another beer, but didn't specify which or did not indicate that the server should come and ask. He also could've, but the server didn't bother to. Can't really know for sure, so I can't say who's responsible.

The place didn't seem that busy as there were empty tables, so I don't think that was the problem. I think they need to work on communicating or fulfilling orders a bit more. Overall, it was decent. We're not sure if we're going to come back, but if so, it won't be because we enjoyed the food. I'm willing to give them another chance, though."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and likely the last time. My wife and I decided to try it out. The beer was good, and the food was fine. Our waitress was very nice, and the reason for the 3 stars is that these following items should be changed: 1) they don't offer any Military discounts and 2) I intentionally went during happy hour only to find out, it was for the bar only, not the dining room side of the place.

Not sure why Happy Hour wouldn't be in all areas. After all, the website has no disclaimer related to this. Regardless of where I receive the food and service, Happy Hour should apply.

Update: Michelle responded to my concerns, so moving up the rating as at least they listen to the customer. thank you!"}
{"text":"We went here on a high recommendation from a friend who brought us. I got the beer sampler and absolutely loved the red, brown and IPA. The seasonal beers were too fruity for my taste. The food: sliders, seafood and wraps were surprisingly good for bar food. I really liked the atmosphere and our waitress was great. Finished with some great Bacardi and Cokes. I would like to revisit this place when I return to Vegas. A lot better of a deal than the Strip."}
{"text":"After work one night my co-workers and I decided to stop by here for some draaaaaaaanks n' food. This was my first time here... We ordered some dranks and a BUNCH of food. No complaints, your average bar food and we are drinkin so it's allll good anyway! I never saw the bill, just threw down some money to pitch in but I think they have some good drink specials... 
We were hangin' out upstairs which I guess closes earlier than the downstairs bar which I found a LITTLE annoying but I guess we could have just moved the party downstairs, however we just called it a night then anyway. I would definitely go back for some more draaaaaanks n' food for a fun low key night!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food Tiffany did great job food was hot and service was excellent!! Thank You."}
{"text":"I will make this short and sweet. I posted pictures of the food. It is as good as it looks. The head cook came to our table and said hello. The place is very clean. You can see into the kitchen. I had pizza and salad. Its got TVs and beer! So you will love this spot if your a sports nut like my husband. It can be a romantic lil spot. Nice lil cuddle spots if you get a booth. Its a must return to for me and the husband. Its a lot of beer snobs at this location so if you want to sit around talking about how great the beer is others will join in and give their 2 cents :)"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour (minus the smoke). Can't beat $2 draft beers, I love the hefeweizen. If it wasn't for the smoke, I'd give it a higher rating. Maybe I'm just spoiled from all other places without smoking these days."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  I so wanted this place to be great...unfortunately, it was disgusting!  The ahi plum salad had fish that should not have been served atop over-dressed wilted greens. They DID take it off of our check, but it never should have made it to our table. Half of my bf's fries were over-cooked, half were under-cooked...you could see the color difference. It was the first time I've ever seen BBQ sauce on a burger not move; he was able to hold his burger, shake it and the sauce still not drip or even slide around at all. While I had no beer, the bf ordered their blonde and it was flat. My \"date night\" ended an hour ago when my bf went to bed sick to his stomach. WY to cock block Chicago Brewing Company!"}
{"text":"Rott gut stale beer made from cheap ingredients.  Check
Bland pizza sauce straight from a can.  Check
Hardly any meat on the deep dish pizza.  Check
Burnt crust.  Check
Terrible service being completely forgotten about.  Check

Check please.

Please do not insult Chicago with this POS."}
{"text":"A decent micro brewery in the midst of one of my favorite casinos.  I've been here several times and played video poker while enjoying my huge brew. Service has always been kind and helpful.  On my latest trip I ordered the steak sliders. They were good.  Food here is pretty cheap for Vegas pricing and drinks are 'free' when gambling.  
Whenever I'm on Fremont Street, I always visit the Chicago Brewery."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  The bartenders are a lot of fun and their summer seasonal beer rocks.  The spicy chicken tenders are a must and the all menu is very affordable."}
{"text":"Food portions are huge so bring an appetite. The brewed beers a good as well and they run a good happy hour. Not quite true Chicago style but a good place to stop for a quick beer and snack before a movie at the thearter next door or a good place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good pizza. Bears game on the screen. Nuff said."}
{"text":"The food here is good - some items are definitely better than others, but I've never been disappointed. If you're looking for an appetizer - get the spinach and artichoke dip in the bread bowl. The bread bowl takes the dip to a totally different level. 

The real key components that set Chicago apart are the phenomenal house-brewed beers, and the awesome staff. They're all knowledgable, give great suggestions and are quick with a recommendation. 

The ambience makes for a great place to grab some drinks on the weekend, and especially during happy hour (crazy amazing prices for craft beer). If you're in on the weekend, make sure you pop up to the Loft upstairs and see Brad. Quick with a joke and always phenomenal service.

All in all a great place to stop in if you're in the area, or just want a good beer."}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing company does beer well, has a great patio, a separate smoking bar for pipes and cigars, and is perfectly average for quality of bar food.  

The Beer:  Chicago brews a lot of great beers that keep the beer snobs coming back ...Coconut Porter, Hawaiian Honey, Blueberry Wheat... and a solid selection to keep novice beer drinkers happy as well. 

The Patio: My favorite thing about Chicago is the beer garden (patio) when the weather is nice.  Cool lighting, nice feel, great Happy Hour!

Two Bars:  Both bars are separated from the restaurant to allow for smoking, but the upstairs bar is cool, classy, and comfortable.

The Food:  Chicago has a huge list of food, with a lot of interesting options...but all-in-all the food is just average bar quality...maybe slightly better...but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in old Vegas. The garlic knots are as everyone has said, superb. I also had a root beer which although could have been colder for my liking was very good. 

The personal Chicago style pizza was almost as good as Gino's East in Chicago which is the best pizza I have ever eaten. I could only mange to eat half and I can usually put away some pizza so if you have someone you could split it with I would suggest you try that first. 

I was surprised how small the place was considering the reviews I seen, and then to actually taste how good the food was I am surprised there is not a constant line out the casino door."}
{"text":"The quality in food has dropped in previous years, the pizza tastes like a 99 cent frozen pizza with little flavor and the crust feels like cardboard. The garlic knots are not soft and tasty like before, they feel hardened and also loss of flavor, the beer is still good though"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Chicago Brewing.  Not sure why, but for some reason I wasn't expecting much.  We sat in the bar area and ordered a sampler of all the beers, 9 total.  They were all actually pretty good!  I liked that they had all different types, everything from Wheat beers to IPA's.  Some were better than others but they were all good.  We each ordered a glass of our favorite and had a plate of garlic knots, which were also good.  The service was fast and friendly and I noticed they had an upstairs area along with the bar and main restaurant.  The food menu had lots of choices and they also have a full bar in case you don't like beer."}
{"text":"Great food and beer.. The staff is great! The upstairs bar is cigar friendly.. Bonus for me..
Check out the bars happy hour items.. Chicken tenders are incredible!!"}
{"text":"ICYDK: This small restaurant is located inside the casino so if you're sensitive to smell then you might want to reconsider. But if your a regular in Vegas you know it comes with the territory.

Craving some deep dish pizza I turned to trusty Yelp which lead us to this place.

Ordered were the wings and the deep dish and neither disappointed. Overall the food was 3.5 stars but I'm still on the search for the best deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times and like it enough to bring family to it. The menu is pretty big and offers something for everyone, but in my experience I will say that the Deep dish baked ziti is AWESOME! The ziti comes out and the outside is like a deep dish pizza. Inside you have a well spiced ziti that we also included itailan sausage, onions, and mushrooms. There is more than enough for 2, and this is what my wife and I usually share when we dine here. Now like the name states this is a working brewing company and they have about 10 of their own beers. I always get the Black Star or Black Spider (can't remember the name) stout. I think it has a great creamy roasted flavor. Only complaint would be that it never comes to the table very cold. I really think they could step up their beers and their beer service if they would serve it ICE COLD in a frosted mug."}
{"text":"When you spend a large amount of time in the same area on a 5-day vacation, you inevitable find a spot or two that you become extremely comfortable with ... a place that becomes a home away from home. On my recent vacation in Vegas, one of those spots was the intimate and welcoming Chicago Brewing Company at the Four Queens. I visited them three times on my vacation, each time being served by Bob (the gentleman in Leila R's picture) I also ran into Bob once at the nearby Banger Brewing and had a great chat with him - it's always great when brewpubs employ people who have a true passion and knowledge for beer. Bob overheard me mention that I was running out of clothes due to my flight being delayed because of the nasty east coast weather, and when I went back for my final visit to Chicago Brewing the next day, Bob gave me an older 2XL t-shirt that they don't print anymore. (Thanks Bob!) Needless to say, the service here was outstanding.

Chicago Brewing's beer sampler is an outstanding deal - 9 different samples for $8.99. I enjoyed it so much, I got one each time that I went. They keep six year-around brews, plus root beer (which is included on the sampler) and typically have two seasonals. Unfortunately they only had one seasonal - an outstanding blueberry wheat brew - so the final beer was a different brew mix each time. It started with a traditional black and tan, the next was a mix of the Hefeweizen and IPA, and my last mix was 1/2 brown ale, 1/2 stout. All of their beers are great, but the blueberry wheat was my favorite. I also really liked their Hardway IPA - it had a nice hoppy flavor but not overpowering with hops. At 6.2%, it's like a \"Session IPA+\" The Black Widow Stout, an Irish Dry Stout, and the Weizenheimer Bavarian-style Hefeweizen also stood out for me. And their root beer is a great palette cleanser for the finish. 

My first visit was for the beer, but I was eyeing the food menu ... and the wonderful looking Chicago Deep Dish Pizza they were serving. So I made a second trip back specifically to get one of these bad boys. It's a personal 9\" deep dish with sausage and pepperoni. The dough was great, cooked perfectly through, and it wasn't overly saucy as some deep dish pizzas are. I'd definitely get this again. 

On my last visit, I had no intention of eating ... until I heard it was half-price appetizers for happy hour daily. One thing caught my eye - filet mignon sliders. Topped with mushrooms and onions, and served with a side of au jus, these are like little French Dip sliders of pure awesomeness. 

My expectations for Chicago Brewing Company were low to be honest. I guess it's the location inside the older (but charming) Four Queens and its old-school, dimly-lit bar vibe. But those expectations were blown away. This is one of my favorite places in Downtown Vegas, and I'll be coming back on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I make it a point to grab lunch here! There pizza is top notch, the brews are cold and delicious and the service is usually awesome! The last couple of times I've gone, the bartender/server was a younger guy that was happy to help, knowledgeable and even cut my cigar for me when I left! I totally recommend grabbing a pie and brew here, and try the wings as well! Worth the trip, every time!"}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food. Garlic knots we're amazing! Mike was our server and he was honest, friendly and on top of it. We Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is now 4-7 again but still no late night happy hour and you no longer have to leave the bar area to get your food. They deliver it right to your table as before. It is annoying that the happy hour is only offered in the smoking venues. I would love to drink my $6 pitcher and eat my $6 pizza without having to go home and shower and wash my clothes afterwards. Other than the smoking complaint, this place is great. Maxx is a great server and takes good care of my party at least once a week. 

All of the food I have tried at CBC has been above average. This place has been a staple for my friends and I for the past two years and we will continue to frequent this place even though they discontinued our favorite 10pm happy hour. The seasonal beer right now is awesome! I hate it that the springfest is no longer available but the brew they replaced it with is a 9% ABV Belgium beer. It's not sold in pitchers but during happy hour it's available in a 16oz goblet for $3. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 or 4 times now and at different times and days. I have always sat in the bar area at a table and I always have to wait or get up and get a server to wait on me. I find this to be very disappointing as I do not understand why when walking in past the hostess stand they can not ask dining in? 
As for the food I have had the chicken strips, French fries, cobb salad and a few appetizers and I do enjoy the food. I usually get a beer and as much as I enjoy a cold mug of beer I do wish I could get a cold pint glass of beer. 
My only complaint is the wait for service even with 3 bartenders on the other day I had to still go get a server to wait on my party. Not even one bartender acknowledged myself or my party. Guest service could be better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop the best filet mignon sliders and potato skins. BEST THING EVER. LAID BACK VIBE, GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was amazing! We tried the sampler with the 9 beers they brew to decide and it was a great choice. The root beer is delicious. Didn't try the food but menu looks good. Definitely a good little spot!"}
{"text":"Not all that. I won a free lunch for two from a local radio station and I'm glad I didn't have to pay the bill. The atmosphere is ok. Service was ok, not great. The menu didn't have much of a selection and the prices were a little high for the quality of food. I wouldn't really go there again unless I won another free luch."}
{"text":"We were greeted as we came in.  (So they knew we were there). Took 15 minutes for them to take a drink order.  (This is at 9:30pm, place was not busy). We ordered food at the same time as the drinks.  (Server wrote down our order). Waited another 15 minutes, never received our drinks yet.  Asked the server, that took our order, the status of our drinks and he replied: \"Are you ready to order?\".    I said we already ordered and we are waiting for our drinks.  He said \"you did?\" .  I tried to refresh his memory, but nothing.   I don't know if it was drugs or lack of sleep.   But we were done.  Place is a joke."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. My husband and I shared the small all meat and added mushrooms & olives. Delicious. We also shared the Greek salad and it was very good too."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great. The sliders were lacking flavor. The thin pizza was made with some funky dough. The kind of dough that you get from Pizza Hut. The service was spotty. Our server would disappear at times. He also didn't have much of a smile in his face and it felt like he didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"I used to love this place then I met this douche by the name of Jesse that works the bar.  Been coming here 15 years and loyalty means nothing to him. Good luck to their restaurant staff I hope the bartenders don't bring down their delicious beer made by their experience brewmasters."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza, garlic knots and draught root beer. So far I have ordered that meal twice and it keeps getting better. The pizza is awesome. It's cheesy, spicy and the crust is buttery and perfect. The garlic knots are out of this world. So much garlic! And the root beer is made in-house and has an awesome vanilla flavor. I don't know about anything else here, but I will be back for more pizza, root beer and knots."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the two servers were awesome. The beer is excellent.
overall A+ 
So when In Vegas stop at the 4 Queens casino and give Chicago Brewing Company a try"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in years when I stopped in after a movie with my Mom and Yelp's own guru: Downtown Steve (5*;) Used to live within walking distance and was a reg years ago. 

We were the only patrons in the dining room and had a young, very charming waiter. My ahi tuna salad was good, and a large enough portion to take half home, but some of the grape tomatoes were just the wrong side of fresh. Mom had chicken fingers and fries which she enjoyed. Steve had a pastrami sandwich, and asked if the onion rings were fresh. The waiter had a puzzled look on his face and asked: \"they do that?!\" We all nodded and giggled; to his credit, he asked the Chef and came back to report that they are frozen. 

Food was good, service was good, Pinot Grigio was A-ok and the company was great. The bar area (smoking) seemed busier as did upstairs. The patio is usually a fair weather favorite spot and lots of folks enjoy their Happy Hour specials. Will have to visit a few more times to see if it is as I remember.  For now, 3*"}
{"text":"Okay, I went here first on a Groupon so this may be a somewhat biased review. I went here again with a few friends after seeing a movie at Red Rock for full price. All I can say is wow, this is a pretty darn good microbrew. Now the beers are pretty good, but nothing to exceptional. The thing I was impressed with far more was the food. My groupon came with a burger, and all I can say was holy cow, the thing was both ridiculous and awesome. Was huge (about 7 or so inches in diameter, 3/4\" thick patty IIRC) , had barbecue sauce and onion rings on top. Was pretty darn good. 

Now I would agree with my friend David S.'s review, between that and their normal bar food if I were a nearby resident I would have a hard time visiting on a frequent basis because the food is all just too much. But for living on the other side of town, you can hardly ask for more!"}
{"text":"9 beers in their sampler. 'Nuff said, but I'll add more.

8 our of the 9 beers in the sampler we all agreed were good. I won't say which since that's too subjective.

Tried a variety of happy hour snacks. Excellent meatballs! A hint of spice and a nice sausage and beef blend. The mustard for the pretzels was surprisingly good; creamy.

Would definitely go back or recommend, however like many Vegas places it has indoor smoking and is a bit acrid."}
{"text":"Super awesome!!! 5 star food and 5 star friendly service.  Baked ziti with Italian sausage to die for.  Definitely two meals, baked in a garlic crust. Heavenly.   Black and white sliders delicious.   Angus beef, blue cheese, carmilized onion.  You have to have the ranch chips......yummmy...home made food at very affordable prices.   The lemoncello is secret Italian recipe.   Do eat and drink here.   Will be back...."}
{"text":"You want beer pizza and wings this is the place to go, we sat at the bar, the bartender was awesome to us. We ordered wings, very hot and delicious, we ordered a thin crust meat pizza and let me tell you it was the bomb. One of the best pizzas i ever ate. Very fresh filling and yummy. We also had drinks my favorite is the root beer on tab. It was so good and cold. I like how you can play poker on the screens at the bar too. They are open late too. We just wanted a place where we could drink eat pizza and wings and gamble and have a great time. Will return here for sure, loved this place."}
{"text":"Good food, not great. They mean SMALL when ordering a small salad. Couldn't have been more than two lettuce leaves ripped up on a small saucer. Garlic knots were yummy :-)"}
{"text":"Its been a few years since i last frequented Chicago Brewing.  I was really pleased with my recent visit!  Chicago was opened in 1999, and back then the craft beer and the menu would have been a real exotic in Vegas.  They have several slider hamburgers with odd meats like alligator, bison, kangaroo, and antelope.  These days, it might be just a novelty, but I loved it!  

I had alligator sliders with the house stout.  My coworkers tried the house IPA, the cheese steak, and one of the salads (the one with tuna on it).  My alligator sliders were awesome.  They each had an egg sunny side up, a tomato, lettuce and sauce.  The dish came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I've never had alligator before!  It tasted kind of like a cross between fish and beef.  The patty itself was lightly fried with some spices that really made the flavor quite nice.  

My friends both enjoyed their lunches as well.  The salad wasn't the best, but it wasn't an iceberg bomb either.  The beer was pretty good.  Back in 1999, this beer would have been top notch.  Today, the West Coast style of brewing is to make bigger beers.  None of the beers crafted at Chicago are above 6.5%.  Chicago has kind of fallen behind the times a little, but the beer is still awesomely fresh.  You can see the brewery through glass walls in the center of the establishment!

Overall, while not the best brewery in Vegas (ahem, Draft House), it is a real treat for craft beer drinkers.  The food is good too.   The restaurant is small enough to be cozy and intimate, so even non-beer drinkers should have a visit to check out the strange sliders or maybe a pizza!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, it's in Village Square located on the northwest corner of Sahara & Fort Apache. They have thier own parking lot, no trouble finding a spot. I have only eaten in thier restaurant side a few times so won't be reviewing the food part of it but thier bar that has its own entrance on the north side of the building. 

As the name suggests they have all sorts of types of beer, thier Hefenweizen is really good! The bar as TV'S all along the bar along with gaming machines. There's seating area for 2 or 4 on the bottom level. Upstairs has more loung  type atmosphere with sofas and comfortable seats. You can order food at the bar, it's your typical bar food. 

The prices are good IMO, me and the wife had 8 vodka soda water's and it was under $65 and left pretty buzzed. Late at night the crowd gets shady but then again that's everywhere. The younger crowd hangs out upstairs. I live very close to here so will be returning."}
{"text":"Not like the location on the west side AT ALL!
The menu was tiny and food was mediocre- no flavor. Just not enjoyable at all (frozen pizza like) and super pricey. Nothing notable to say that was great. I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best deep dish pizza and garlic knots and I always win at the keno at the bar!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere, the shrimp appetizer showed up way to soon so you know it is oversalted and overmarinted. Made for shrimp that was overdone and tough. They only have one steak dinner on the menu and being all alone it should be better. Mine did not have the flat iron crust and since it came sliced the juice bled out making for a dry steak without the flat iron charr. One last thing this restaurants location is loaded with sewer gas, inside and out. Once you take a bite and start tryimg to enjoy it the front door opens-whoosh in comes the sewer gas again accenting the pungent smell inside already. Some food gives you gas this food comes with it!"}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from this place so I ate there quite often. Beer is pretty good but I'd have to say the food is what sets this place apart from other breweries anywhere. I live in the bay area now and theres nothing like this out here sadly :(.

I have to say, this place has the best Ruben sandwich I've ever had in my life. You seriously need to try it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here yesterday. The service was outstanding. We were seated immediately and the food and drinks came very quickly. My food was very good, but I unfortunately couldn't eat it all because I wasn't feeling well. Our waitress overheard me telling my boyfriend I wasn't feeling well, and she told me she hopes I feel better. I didn't get her name, but she was very sweet. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! Inside the 4 queens casino toward the back, small Chicago style brewery with fresh oven pizza and ice cold micro brews. The starter salad and 10\" meat lovers pizza my wife and I had was perfect to share, I had a great all nighter beer and my wife enjoyed her root beer. Wish we had one of these brewery near our home in the Bay Area, 5 stars on Fremont street do yourself a favor go here and not the cheap pizza slice joint down the street. Same price for 2 slices there as a 10\" oven fresh pizza!
Great service, great food, great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while now and my first visit was definitely a pleasant one. The man who greeted us at the door was very polite and showed us to our table. It was such a nice day out that we decided to take advantage of the outdoor seating area. It was really nice and had plenty of shade. We couldn't come here and not try a deep dish pizza. We ordered one with pepperoni and sausage and some steak house fries as an appetizer. Everything came out great and tasted as good as it looked. I'll be back again when the mood strikes for good pizza with a good beer."}
{"text":"The best deep dish pizza in Las Vegas!! It is the best pie since I visited Chitown. I'm no expert. But! I will eat the pie over any other I have had to date. Thank you for making this a pizza destination."}
{"text":"We have been to Chicago Brewing Company (CBC) a few times now and always have really enjoyed the fun atmosphere, the great hand crafted beer, and the food. CBC sits in the corner of the parking lot on the Ft Apache side off of Sahara. Very cool looking brick exterior which really reminds of you of a older restaurant from back east, possibly Chicago. 
When you walk in they have a few areas for you to choose from on where to sit and eat, and of course drink. Off to the immediate left when you first walk in is the enclosed bar and gaming area. They do serve food in here as well, and with all the TV's neatly tucked up under the bar we usually choose this area. Off to the right hand of side when you walk in is the main dining room which is pretty good size with all different sizes of tables to accommodate a couple or a large group. There is also a second story that is accessible through the bar area, but if I remember right its strictly drinking up, no food. 
Last time we were there was about 3 days ago. We went into the bar area like I said we normally do, and as usual it did not disappoint. We mad small talk with the bartender who is very friendly and even more knowledgeable about his beers. I always go for the Chicago style stuffed crust pizza. They offer many toppings of meat and vegetables. I kept it pretty plain on this night and ordered just pepperoni. I ordered the large which is a little pricey at over 25$, but the pizza is huge and very filling. I also ordered their soup of the day which was the Cajun chicken. My girlfriend ordered the steak sandwich which turned out to be the star of the night....more on that later. We then ordered a few of their hand crafted beers, I ordered the blond, and my gf the stout. Both were very good and not over powering, but not watered down either. 
Now onto the food. My soup came out first. It was a huge bowl of soup, with plenty of great tasting veggies and chicken. The broth was very satisfying and eventually I ate the entire bowl. Next came out my pizza, and my gf's steak sandwich. The pizza was great as usual, very thick, very meaty and the sauce is something that will keep you coming back for sure. True Chicago style pizza. Now the steak sandwich stole the show with a nice 7-8 oz what looked to be NY strip steak, a garlic aoli, lightly breaded onion rings and a very nice bib lettuce. All together this sandwich is top die for. At one point I found myself trying to steal more of the sandwich and left my pizza to the side. 
Overall we cannot get enough of CBC. We always take the extra time to figure out how we can get over there at least once a month, maybe more. True Chicago style pizza, but with a lot more. Check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was meeting an old friend of mine in Summerlin and wanted a good pizza and some beer. Bartender recommended the Scotch Ale. That was one of the better beers I've ever had! Moved over to the restaurant side and had the meat lover's deep dish pizza. Very good pizza and had two more Scotch Ales with dinner. Was there 2.5 hours and waiter treated us great checking on us when drinks needed refilling. Overall great place and would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish pizza, craft beer, garlic knots, onion rings, and chicken.   Nice service, as well. One of my favorite places to invite friends and family to."}
{"text":"The cheesy bread was awesome.  The pizza was a mess.  Good beers, people at my table said.  The root beer was pretty fine.  But, when cheese and sauce is just falling everywhere, and when the attention to detail is not Lou Malnati's quality, I dock points on my ratings."}
{"text":"I came in here for dinner before going to a concert at the nearby Golden Nugget. I wanted to sit at the bar but my dad informed me that it was part of the 'cigar lounge', so we sat at a high table instead in the non-smoking part of the restaurant.
I didn't think about ordering the Chicago deep dish pizza and went for the Chicago Dog instead, and mind you, this thing is HUGE. The toppings they give you are relish, mustard, peppers, and onions. Believe it or not, I finished the entire thing along with a side of fries. The Chicago Dog has got to be one of the best hot dogs I've ever tried.
Though the restaurant is super small (located inside 4 Queens casino), I had a good dinner. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza, garlic knots and beers are all pretty good.  Assuming you can get a server.

On my last trip, about 5 minutes after sitting down, a server dropped menus on our table without breaking stride and without saying a word.  Another 10 minutes passed and he didn't return, so... fuck it.  Lots of places to eat in Vegas.  The party at the next table had the same problem.

Tiny place, so seating can be a challenge."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure of eating here since it is next door to Magnolias and I am not a fan of that restaurant. This turned out to be Fremont Streets best kept secret. We ordered the brew wings and Muffaletta sandwich to share. The wings were crispy with a perfect amount of sauce and the sandwich was fresh. Our only criticism was the waitress could have been a little friendlier, (was not rude, just didnt smile or great us) however I have a great respect for anyone in the service industry in this town."}
{"text":"If you are looking for pizza that is not from you know the normal carry out this is it! They have the best deep dish pizza!!! Their wings are amazing 2 oh yeah you need to try their clam chowder their potato soup or their French onion soup they re the absolute best!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and fabulous food, brews are just as they have always been tasty."}
{"text":"From 1/9/16
We came to Chicago Brewing company after a movie to nosh on some burgers and have a drink. Chicago Brewing Company is located in Village Square, on the Fort Apache side of the street.

We were seated, and the restaurant area was practically empty, no complaints there. Our server seemed kind of blah; I'm assuming she was drained by the tone of her voice. But hey not her fault, sometimes you just have an off day!

We ordered the burgers; they were soooooo good, cooked perfectly and just all around good flavoring. 

I will be back for sure to try their other items."}
{"text":"Nice spot for lunch and great beer!  I had their Hathaway IPA,excellent!  Lots of hops with no bitter after taste.  Also enjoyed their lighter seasonal IPA.  
Deep dish pizza was very good, and we are
critical since we love Giordano's pizza in Illinois.  We had the miracle mile meat lover pizza and Tuscany salad.  Both very yummy!"}
{"text":"First of all I used to love this place and came here frequently with my wife and friends when they came into town. I also work on the strip so I would often recommend tourists to travel from the strip to eat here. This is my first time back in 2 years and it was a huge let down. They completely changed the menu and even the staff complained that patrons often request items from the old menu and often times leave when told they can't be accommodated. We decided to give it a try and the food was made well and they even attempted to make the brew house fries which hands down was the best thing on the menu. Wasn't the same. It was good enough to eat but I'm sad to say I'll be crossing my favorite place off the list for date nights. I'll be voting with my wallet else where. The service was good but I came for the food and I now know what disappointment tastes like."}
{"text":"Long story short. 

Threw the \"dirty\" rag on the table I was sitting at- to the other table, when walking into the bar seating area.  Waiter saw that and gave me a dirty look. Had 20 minutes until his sexton closed, he gave some girls some stuff and helped them, came to us 5 minutes before shift (yes, 15 minutes passed) and then said here's so menus, I'm leaving. 

Then, we pick what we want and go to bar, he says, \"wrong menu\". Gave us another one, finally ordered and they delivered. Overall it was okay- not so bad, but not so good. I figured for having table seating it might be a little better than standard bar food, but not that impressed. 

I get the waiter, but just get over it, obviously I wasn't purposely being a jerk, I just didn't see you. 

I also got eye-rolled for smoking and as well as they held their noses, by two \"dimbo\" girls.  It's a bar, 2AM, get over yourselves. Speaking of them, the crowd was young, too much for me. Can't believe I'm saying that and I'm not even 29, that's both: depressing and pitiful."}
{"text":"The place was nice and chill on a Sunday afternoon, before the Knights game. Started off in the dining room area. I like that the music was low, so our group could have a conversation. I ordered some pretzel bites to start, and a deep dish pepperoni and sausage pizza for lunch. The pretzel bites were great! They were not and buttery, with two sauces. Both the cheese and mustard sauces were really good. The pizza was also good. I do prefer Giordano's deep dish, but this pizza wasn't bad at all. The handcrafted root beer is a star! It's heavier and smoother than bottled stuff, and much less carbonation. I'd come back just for the root beer. After lunch, some of us headed to the bar area to smoke cigars. A nice place to hang out with friends. The employees were nice and very helpful. I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for Happy Hour for their great chicken wings. Their pizza is great too. They have a wide variety of things to choose from on their menu, and offer a  variety of beers also, that they make there. Go and enjoy !"}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago, very enjoyable meal.  We shared the Chicago deep dish pizza (excellent) and the garlic knots.  My wife and daughter split the ziti dish and I had a buffalo chicken wrap.  All of the food was very tasty and fresh.  My wife, who is from Chicago, also greatly enjoyed her meal.  The portions are enormous, especially the deep dish pizza.  We had plenty of pizza, garlic knots and ziti to bring home and enjoy for a couple of days after.  The buffalo chicken wrap was also very good and had just enough \"zing\" to satisfy my spicy food cravings.
      As we had a child with us, we did not check out the bar area, only the restaurant, which is physically seperated into two different rooms to accomodate both families and bar customers.  Overall, I found the Chicago Brewing Company to be a very good find, and would definately recommend giving it a try if you haven't been there already...."}
{"text":"After driving by Chicago Brewing Company countless times, I finally decided to stop by for Ken M.'s UYE last week. In short, the company was great, as was the brown ale. I sampled the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie brew... meh... not my thing. I split the wild game sliders with Norm and Tony (6 for $30) and my favorites were the rabbit, wild boar and bison. Honestly, I can't even remember what the others (alligator, antelope, rabbit/antelope mix) tasted like. It was a week ago, afterall.  If you're a fan of sliders, check it out since they're some of the more unique ones you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"We visited June 18th. Of the 3 breweries I sampled in Vegas, Chicago Brewing had the best beer. The IPA was outstanding, not overly hoppy and lovely citrus overtones. I also thought the atmosphere and food was excellent to very good. I really enjoyed sitting in the cigar lounge overlooking the casino floor as hubby did a little gambling and I did a little drinking and people watching (no I don't smoke, but smoke smell was not overly offensive). We had an excellent pizza for dinner, husband enjoyed a root beer. Sure wished we would have ordered the garlic knots as suggested in the other reviews, especially regretted it when the table next door got an order...they smelled divine and I overheard them raving about them...but by then we were full and ready to move on. I would have given CBC 4 and a half stars if it were possible. Service was good and I wanted a beer w/ souvenir glass and they did not have them, so the guy tried to get me to buy some $15 glass, minor stuff."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicagoan who frequented Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, etc. all my life. CBC's deep dish leaves nothing to be desired. In fact, I enjoy the rich dough / crust even more. 

Vegas recently got a Giordano's, but I will be hitting up CBC for deep dish. It's less costly and as a local now, I hate going to the strip just to eat. 

The kicker is that there is cigar-friendly section. For non-smokers, the main restaurant section is smoke free.  The humidor is decently stocked. Prices range a bit, but one of my fav smokes (CAO Brazilia) was in stock and sold at a fair price  of $7."}
{"text":"We were in tonight for dinner. We sat in The dining room because the bars were both full. It was football Sunday at the the end of the season so that is to be expected. Our server was really attentive and rocked it. She checked on us often but wasn't annoying about it even though the dining room was empty. 
We started with the steak sauce fries which were absolutely yummy. I would definitely suggest them to anyone coming in. After eating those I was expecting our sandwiches to be just as amazing and they just missed the mark completely. I had the NY steak sandwich. The garlic aioli sauce on it was the only thing that saved it. The French bread was really soggy, the steak itself had no flavor. It could've at least had some salt and pepper on it. 
Overall the food was good but with BJs and Claimjumpers so close in distance I was hoping for better food for the price. I will stick to the other two instead and possibly stop in to pick up those fries again."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, be aware that it's a cigar place, so it reeks of cigar smoke and the food was only ok.  The waiter didn't even bother coming back to see if we wanted a second beer."}
{"text":"Excellent little place inside the 4 queens casino, had the garlic knots and filet mignon sliders for appetizers with a wheat beer that was a great start for the delicious deep dish pizza filled with pepperoni and sausage!!! Must visit for any deep dish pizza or regular pizza fan!"}
{"text":"The happy hour appetizer menu is a joke, good in the way of drinks but a joke for food. On the menu is personal pan cheese pizza , garlic knots , and pretzel bites. The pizza was thin crust and $5 you are better off going to little Caesar's. It was OK but so small and thin the $5 just didn't seem well spent. The pretzel bites came with  weird tasting cheese; me and my friends couldn't figure out if it was just some weird pasteurized melted cheese or plain bad. We avoided dipping pretzels bites in it and opted for ranch/mustard instead. The garlic knots were much better and very big, they were actually the best thing on the menu. The sangria was also pretty good and I believe only $5-6 it came in a big glass as well with fresh fruit; delicious!!!! Will be back for the drink happy hour, it was worth it, but my advice is eat before you come otherwise prepare for dissapointment."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  Their Cod Fish entree served with cole slaw is wonderful.  This is a great restaurant to visit over and over again."}
{"text":"My beer was amazing!!!! The taste was great!!! The atmosphere was fun!!! We had a group of 15 and they were very accommodating!! We love pizza so it was really gonna challenge us to go outside our own pizza box!!! We would have loved to get a big deep dish pizza but they only serve it in 9\"!! Kind of a downfall:( we ordered a large meat pizza, thin crust!! Let me tell you it was superb!!! Sauce was just right, the amount of cheese was perfect!!!! And the wait staff was excellent!!! Definitely two thumbs up!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great looking brewery from the outside and inside. Went for their graveyard happy hour and was extremely impressed with both the micro brews and the price points of $2.50 for a 22oz :0. Great service even though they were slammed. Awesome all the way around."}
{"text":"charlie may have been one of the best bartenders i have ever had. his attention to detail efficiency was spectacular.

the food is amazing, the beers are delicious and the service by charlie was stellar."}
{"text":"I took my sister out for dinner here. This place is awesome! We had Teriyaki wings and deep dish chicken Alfredo pizza soo delicious!! Loved the beer sampler as well! When I come back to Vegas def coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer. And the deep dish Chicago pizza is great., robust sauce and big. My wife had the Caesar salad wrap and she says it was quite good ."}
{"text":"Great service.  Ashley was so nice and explained the menu items. The garlic knots are super good. Great place. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Only in Vegas does one have to walk through a poorly ventilated casino and into a little cigar bar to get a craft beer.

We had a special deal in our Yelp Spring Break book for a $2.50 beer here which lured us in.  I went for a mango wheat (because wheat beer is pretty awesome and mangos are super awesome) only to find out they had switched it out for blueberry vanilla or some such thing.  Obviously better that your typical Bud Light/Heineken typically found in Vegas, but it tasted a bit like an air freshener.

It really wouldn't be a bad place to hang if it weren't for the cigar bar aspect, but we could only really handle it for a few minutes before we took our beers to go and lost some money in the slot machines."}
{"text":"We were told this place was amazing. I think amazing might be a bit of a stretch.
Good food, at a great price. Absolutely! But that is about it.

The beer drinkers at the table loved the selection of beers.
Maybe that is the secret? Go to get drunk and have good pizza?"}
{"text":"Had a good night out at Chicago Brewing a couple of weeks ago.  Server was quite friendly and fast.

Pluses, service and the food, very good.  

Super pluses!!! Old Town Brown Ale!  Great tasting craft beer and great price $6 for 22 ounces.  

Minus, only one.  You can sometime smell the smoke from the bar in the dining room.  

Other than that, A OK"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Hipster looking lol. More of a restaurant vibe than brewery. Their selection was decent. Light tasting ipa and the typical stout to pilsner list. Bar tender not as attentive but she was aight. 2 stories seems like it could be popping but it was kinda dead at 8pm sat"}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic knots and a 9 inch deep dish pizza. The garlic knots were decent, the pizza though was less than impressive.

Great list of beers at least.

Service here was EXTREMELY slow. All the other tables had at least 4 people so again I think we were viewed as the least important table. Our server was never apologetic for the waiting either. Just about scrapes 3 stars, we definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Never eaten here but the beer is some of the best. The Saison is to die for!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here while in town for a youth hockey tournament.  It was a brewery within walking distance of the hotel.  I thought it was a perfect match.  However, the place allows smoking.  I would have given them four stars if they were smoke free.  

I realize this is a Las Vegas thing, but it ruined my apatite.  They do have outdoor seating.  We asked to sit out there.  Our waitress came back and said a large group had used all of the propane the night before.  I am not sure if I believe that.

I ate a small thin crust pizza.  It was OK.  My wife had a huge salad.  She said it was OK.  I bet both would have tasted better if we weren't passively breathing in second hand smoke.

The beer was good.  I had the house brown ale and the IPA.  I would have had another if the place was smoke free."}
{"text":"Great crispy wings, pizza and filet mignon sliders, highly recommend! Only down side is all the smoke! It is a cigar bar after all. Prices are fair too"}
{"text":"This place has a nice outdoor lounge area. Their happy hour specials are pretty great too. 4pm-7pm they have half off house drafts and some great deals on appetizers. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Their happy hour goes pretty late. I would recommend their large pan crust BBQ chicken pizza. Yum!"}
{"text":"Try the chili cheese fries for an app!!  Huuuge portions.  The beef dip sandwich is  a fav lunch item."}
{"text":"It was a slow day, the waitress was good. The beer was actually really good, I'm not a huge IPA fan so I usually get the lightest IPA. The happy hour deals are great prices and the food is good and came out quick. I'd definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Great service. We sat at the rail and received excellent service from three different bartenders. They were all working in synchronized harmony making sure that we we're well taken care of.

The Beer: we got the sampler which had 9 tastes for only $8! The IPA was almost perfect for me, floral flavors with lots of hops :) The seasonal was a vanilla blueberry heffeweizen, which was just so uniquely tasty. I thought it would be too sweet for me but it was a perfectly refreshing summer beer.

The Food: the garlic chicken pizza was very flavorful and just the right size for yourself or for two if you shared it with a salad, which we did. The salad was just simple field greens with tomatoes and onions. It was just good enough.

Overall I was just so happy to find good craft beer, brewed in Vegas. Everything else were great surprise bonuses. Can't wait to come back ;)"}
{"text":"So this time around my husband and I came here because he was looking for a cigar lounge on Fremont Street. He visited this place twice during our trip and had a great experience both times. When I came with him during one of his visits, we were greeted with a friendly waitress. We ordered drinks and pizza and watched the game, which was nice. There is not much of a menu, your normal bar food, but if you are looking for a nice chicago style deep dish pizza, come here and check it out.
Just to note: there are 2 sides to this place- the cigar lounge and the restaurant, so you can choose either side. 
Our bill for 4 drinks and the pizza was 36, which is good for Vegas. The only thing that complicated things with our visit was that the waitress got quite busy at times and so it took a while to get our check, but that was okay!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The rambling wreck is the best beer in Vegas. I got the giant souvenir glass, which is an alcoholic's wet dream. Thin crust pizza was very tasty. Only complaint, for a cigar friendly bar, the ventilation was bad on the couches. Will be back next time, won't waste any more time at triple 7, this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"I like the Filet Mignon sliders, garlic knots and the thin crust pizza.  They are really good.  My complaint would be: I think it's too expensive for the kind of food.  $11 for three sliders!  Maybe I could see it if they piled the meat on them, but they don't.  Just one very thin layer of meat.  $14 for a pitcher of beer! 

I make it a point to go during \"happy hour\". The appetisers are half price then. Also you can use your 4 Queens players card and get money off the bill (if you have any comps due).

I also feel the service here is painfully slow."}
{"text":"In a word disappointing. First the good stuff: beer isn't bad and very inexpensive; the staff is very nice and extremely friendly; cool looking interior and the dining area looks clean and newer.  The rest is bad: food is awful, extremely salty and over cooked equivalent to cheap pub food just with a bigger price tag (I didn't have the pizza though, perhaps that is good); the bathrooms were filthy which always makes me question what the kitchen might look like.  Only recommend if you are hankering for cheap bar food and drinks but you would really prefer to pay more for it."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Chicago's - we usually dine here on Friday or Saturday nights on an almost weekly basis.  We like it because it's only about 10 min from our house and the food is consistent.

We order mostly the same things (not all at one time of course) .. LOL
Brew BQ Burger, Sliders (Black and Bleu and Chicken Cordon Bleu), Deep Dish pizza, Steak Fries appetizer, Steamed Clams, French Onion Soup, Clam Chowder.  On occasion - I'll order the Philly cheesesteak and although it's not a replacement for a real cheesesteak - it is a pretty good sandwich.

One thing that I really like about this place is that the waitstaff doesn't turn over often - so if you are a regular like us, you know that you are going to get decent, cordial, consistent service.

Although we aren't big drinkers - you can't beat their beer prices.  I'm a fan of the stout beer and for $4 - it's a really great deal.

Chicago's is not a trendy place nor is it a dive - but you'll get a consistent, reasonably priced meal every time you go."}
{"text":"Although I live right across the street from this place, I don't eat there often.  This time I enjoyed it.  The baked ziti deep dish was a treat!  They take ziti, mozzarella, parmesan and fine marinara sauce and bake it right in to a deep dish pizza crust!  Fantastic.  The salad was good.  I got a beer but found it too warm.  I asked the server to make it colder so she brought a frozen mug to pour it in.  Didn't help much.  For $4 I would have preferred her bringing me a newer colder one."}
{"text":"They open at 11:30, but it was 11:34 before they opened up. Not a huge deal, just a pet peeve. We went to sit at a table and it was still dirty from the night before, but the waiter quickly wiped it down (and he also later wiped down the other tables in the dining room).
We ordered the garlic knots and the 9\" deep dish pepperoni. We're from Illinois but have lived in Denver for the last year where the pizza is terrible so we were looking forward to good pizza.
First, the garlic knots are a great value. I think we got about 7 of them for $4.99. They're large knots too. They're more on the flaky side vs. Chewy. Good though.
The deep dish was also quite good. It's no Gino's East, but still good. The sauce isn't quite as chunky as you'd find in Chicago, but frankly, I prefer a smoother sauce. Server did a good job and was friendly and prompt with refills. 
Overall, I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Things that have brought me great disappointment:

1. The Minnesota Vikings 
2. The discovery there is no Santa Claus
3. The quality of the beer at Chicago Brewing Company

Las Vegas lacks a brew pub with great beer, great food, and fun atmosphere. (Big Dogs comes close, but not quite.)  Chicago Brewing Company offers okay food coupled with mediocre beer.  The cavernous (and usually empty) dining room gives off a forlorn vibe.  Combine this with the quality of the beer and you have the epitome of depression right on Sahara Avenue.

What can Chicago Brewing Company do to save itself?

1. Start brewing truly original (and tasty) beer.  They are a prime example of how microbrew doesn't always mean good.  For example:  A porter should have a hint of roasted coffee aroma, not taste like someone's excrement after a trip to Starbuck's.
2. Expand upon the more creative options on the food menu.
3. Rearrange the dining area to make it more intimate and less \"cavern of doom.\"

Until then, I will wait for someone to open a great brew pub in Vegas.  However, I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch! Appetizers were fabulous drinks were awesome, and service was amazing! Our server Ronika was very informative, upbeat, and quick. She delivered  exceptional  customer service. Just move into town from SoCal and this was the best customer service I have experienced since arriving in Las Vegas. We will defeat be coming back.

My favorites eats were the garlic knots the deep dish pizza (magnificent meat lovers), and the spinach artichoke dip. Also enjoyed the house beers very delish."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the day it opened. Had employee Christmas parties here. Many long drinking/ gambling nights. The big catch is how nice and endearing the staff is to regulars. But also love that they are not afraid to send people home when they are acting up. You definitely get that \"Cheers\" vibe. Continued success. Oh btw just found out they started brewing their own Nitro coffee from beans roasted down the street at Desert Wind Roasters. Great companies support other local businesses. Whohoo!!"}
{"text":"I came here last Friday night while I was in Vegas to hang out with my brother and my best friend...we came at around 11:30 just for a few appetizers and beer. I was surprised it wasn't busier, but it was good - there were only a few other groups in the bar area. My brother and friend liked the beer selection, I didn't really pay attention as I'm not a huge beer drinker. Service was average at best - our server checked on us maybe once after he brought our food and just seemed kind of aloof. My friend ordered wings which were DELICIOUS, but I had the chili fries - they came with tons of cheese as well as this creamy beer cheese, which was all right but it was just way too much cheese. They should do one or the other. The chili on it was good but we couldn't eat very many of them. (They were cheap though - I $9 for a HUGE plate.)

I did like the feel and atmosphere of the bar and I'm going to give it another shot when I'm back in Vegas and in more of a drinking mood. Maybe if I'm drunk next time I'll love the chili fries."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and wonderful pizza! The apps are reasonably priced! Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Chicago style deepdish was great. I don't know how true to the original their pizza is as I have never been to Chicago, but I thought it tasted fantastic. What an unlikely place to find it too. The beer was quite nice. I have had quite a few IPAs and consider myself somewhat of an aficionado and theirs definitely stood out.  Deff"}
{"text":"This place is just decent. Place was packed, which shocked me. We were able to find a table (connected to others) and our waiter took forever- poor thing was the only one running around like a chicken with his head cut off. He was really nice though. Food was decent- they forgot our potato skins which was the reason we were there LOL! The manager ended up comping our sodas which again, was really nice. This place may be better during off times..."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place 1 year ago, but I guess all those people are gone now. Today they have an Asian/filipina hostess she was rude. The pizza is not the same the taste is not the same. Thank god I only spend 15$ here.

 please stay away."}
{"text":"Hate to say it but the beers here are mediocre.
I have liked their Fremont St. location due to proximity to downtown activities and casinos, but find this place lacking and their beers tasting like average craft beer from the late 1990's to perhaps early 2000's. The brewery scene in Las Vegas has improved, but Chicago Brewing hasn't.
Nothing very interesting or crisp tasting, with the usual \"pale, amber, brown, stout\", and a weak IPA core lineup. Seasonals were a steam beer, blueberry vanilla ale, and golden ale with lime and none were really any good.
Service was decent, location easy to get to and a little dated on décor but passable. Food was just OK."}
{"text":"So far, the best place I've been to in Las Vegas for craft beers in a brewpub.
Lower original gravity=less taste, and most places are mailing in their versions of different styles on the lower end of the ranges. The beers here are more true to style, with more taste. 
I'll admit that I'm spoiled living in the Pacific NW, so the brewpubs in LV wouldn't last long there, but are still a major step above BMC beers.
Chicago Brewing's amber is solid, their pale is solid, their IPA is good but not overpowering with bitterness. Had a great weizenbock seasonal here once too. Generally good beers.
The pub overlooks the 4 Queens casino, and has a cigar case. Smoking and non smoking areas since they expanded.
Very good service, very nice and friendly servers who take good care of you while there. 
The pizza is good, and the other food on the menu is better than average bar fare.
Worth checking out if you want something more than Bud, Miller, or Heineken for beers while visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Four Queens and there was a coupon for buy one get one free beer and we went to try it out. The beer was good. The place was nice and cozy. The food menu looked good and it was reasonable priced. The staff was very nice and friendly, even gave me a miniature draft as I was cashing out."}
{"text":"Beer Hot !! 101%. Chicago 9' Pizza +\-  but service guy... Terrific this men never smile for  a second. Bad experience sorry.  My friend send me to this place. Never back a gain."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Primarily because it's the closest bar to where I live.

If you're a member of the younger crowd 21-35 you'll probably love this place. If you're looking for a quite place to get away and have a drink this is not the place.

Friday and Saturday nights, as well as many evenings, the place is so packed it's hard to find a spot at the bar.

You'll find a lot of kids yelling and screaming acting as if it's the first time they've ever had a drink.

As for there food I've tried most everything on the menu and every time it's been a disappointment.

The staff is usually very friendly and attentive.

So although I go here on a regular basis I wouldn't give it high marks. But like I said if you're younger and want to hang out with a louder crowd you'll probably enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza I have ever had! And if I were to have a last meal on earth.... the chicken wings, a deep dish pizza, and a 22oz glass of the \"All Nighter\" beer would be it!

Our family has been coming here as part of our Thanksgiving tradition for over 10 years! This hidden gem is located in the 4 Queens hotel. It is located upstairs near the Golden Nugget side of the casino. They have a bar area with about 15 seats at the bar, and then about 5 high top round table that seat 4-8 people. They also have a cigar lounge with couches to sit on while smoking your stogie.

The chicken wings come in an order of 10. They have various sauces but we usually stick with the mild buffalo sauce. Very tasty!! The star of this place, in my opinion, is the deep dish pizza. It comes in a small personal pan, split into 4 pieces. Don't let the size fool you. This pizza is smothered in cheese, on top of a light, but doughy thick crust. The pizza also comes with sausage and pepperoni embedded into the cheese. I once ate the whole thing, and then slipped into a food coma! lol! My Fiancee and I split one pizza, and sometimes have one slice left over. 

This place is also part of a brewery. The serve their own craft beers ranging from a light pilsner, to an amber ale, an IPA, and a stout. I have had the pilsner and amber ale and thoroughly enjoy them. 

If I were ever to stand by a 5 star rating this is the one! The service is fantastic! The pizza is fantastic! The wings are fantastic! And the fact that it is still a hidden gem is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars for us! Here on St Patrick's day with our awesome server DAMIEN!! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Great Place!! I felt at sweet home here thanks to the bartenders!  The Italian Beef was EXCELLENT!!   Add some Provolone and you're in heaven.  My BF got the BBQ Bacon Burger and also loved it. It was huge.  The beer was great too."}
{"text":"Since this is a brewing company, I had to try the beer. The best way I thought was to go with the sampler... It comes with 9 (i'm not sure, I stopped counting after the first buzz kicked in!).. 

Out of the beers, I enjoyed the seasonal beer which was the blueberry vanilla. Guess it's cause I like fruity. I don't usually like dark brews but I enjoyed the black star stout. Had a very yummy coffee taste to it. The other beers I didn't really care for.. and actually some had a really really bitter to it. (Yes, I know beer is suppose to taste bitter but I didn't care for these). 

The food was good. Nothing I'd actually really crave again. The chili cheese fries were good.. reminded me of an upgrade weinersnitchel  chili cheese fries. I liked that they used thin fries instead of a thick cut. 

I don't like blue cheese but it went well with my sliders. The carmelized onions added a nice sweetness to it...

And there you have it, my review of chicago brewing company."}
{"text":"This is for the Irish nachos.. Gross!! Mixing cheese sauce with shredded cheese is disgusting!! Just use cheddar people! The beer selection was great and tasted really good. Next time we come back we will do without the nachos"}
{"text":"Moved in across the road.  Server was a bit of a lingerer for my liking.  Ordered the chicken tenders, they were very nice, just need to be drained more as they sitting in oil which was unappetizing.  Pizzas were ok, however one base was on the over cooked side and was under cooked."}
{"text":"My memories of Chicago are probably like everyone else's...mooning an umpire at a White Sox game. Like most people I have interfered with a potential playoff home run baseball, rode the back of Bill Cartwright, never ate at anything Michael Jordan owned, threw up deep dish pizza in a drunken haze, and snagging some cheap chick from Tinley Park in the bathroom of Exedus II. (We all know they are the easiest chicks in the Metro area...gotta love the naïve suburbs.)  You know, the usual things any one does in Chicago.

All of those good memories came flooding back to me when I passed the Chicago Brewing Company. A wave of emotions hit me...I almost hit my hearse into a bus full of nuns...almost reliving another Chicago memory I have tried to hard to forget. The smell of burning Habit is really oft putting and not one you forget easily...but I digress...
I sauntered into the bar a few months ago ready to smash any of those Chicago loving goons for just looking at me wrong, and what I found was a really nice place to eat, a great bar and some good food.
First, the downstairs dining room.  Sometimes your old pal Rex has a hard time getting up and down stairs. That damn keyboard cleaner really throws off your balance when you huff two cans.  So, I decided to eat where it was most convenient.  The one legged hooker with dysentery appreciated it...all that shaking from the hoping up the stairs can produce some horrible results.   She got a chicken sandwich with hot sauce and I got a cobb salad, a corn cob screwed up my partial plate. Remember kids...always brush at least once a week, I wish my 6 foster mothers told me that instead of what a loser I was.  Anyway...the cob salad is gigantic. It is a great salad. Chicken, bacon, avocado, egg, you name it. All fresh, all well seasoned and all very good.  Jasmine, if that was her real name, told me the sandwich was very hot, I wouldn't touch anything she touched but next time I tried it and I thought it was excellent. Big piece of chicken fried and covered with hot sauce.  There could have been more sauce because the bun was a little dry.  I ate several times down there and all the food was good, the waitress service was great and I never had a time where I wanted to start slicing up the booth with my steak knife. A good sign. The food was always good, but nothing they did was ever great other than the salad...wondering about the pizza...keep reading...

The bar upstairs is where things get fun.  There are a few tv's, some high top tables and chairs and a great little lounge area.  Good times on the weekend if you like the yuppie crowd. Rex doesn't. Perfect for discussing what is easily the best part of this place...the beer. Ah, the beer. They brew their own beer and it is good.  Despite burning my tongue on a tailpipe...don't ask...I could taste all the hoppy goodness.  They have a pale ale and go always up to a nice dark beer. Fruit beers, the blueberry one I tried, was good but not great, other than that they were damn good brews.

Rex will end this on a bad note, just like his 4 marriages, 8 colleges, 19 stops in state run facilities and the one time he met Kyle Petty.  The deep dish pizza sucks! Not just by deep dish pizza standards...but by pizza standards.  The crust is buttery, but after that it falls apart. It is not filled enough with toppings and cheese. It is a chinsy deep dish pizza.  Most medium deep dishes are about 8lbs, sometimes more. This is like 4. They need to add more to it and make it a more substantial pie.  I was disgusted. I threw mine over the balcony and screamed down from the bar \"Al Capone should have killed all you sewer rats.\" Strangely they got upset by this. I am not sure I am allowed back.  I am not sure I care.

Rex Marvin leads. You follow."}
{"text":"Great experience good food great beer the garlic knots are the best ... Kimmie was the best server we have had in years.."}
{"text":"My family really likes this place. The outdoor seating is wonderful, especially with a young child. The happy hour specials are great, and can be utilized outside. I enjoy the food, the beers, and the pizza is a nice replacement for almost the real Chicago deal. The service is top notch.I am looking forward to the cooler weather, to enjoy lazy weekends on the patio, watching sports and enjoying the amazing food and service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place as well as it's satellite location in the Four queens Hotel on Fremont. The beers are well made and tasty. Service has always been friendly and efficient when I have visited.
The pizza both deep dish and tavern style are tasty hot and fresh, not great mind you but tasty. The Garlic Knots here are outrageous, they are so damn good. I've also had the sliders with ghost pepper sauce and they too are quite tasty.
This is definitely worth a stop in, if you are in the neighborhood. Good Beer, Good food, and good fun!!!!
Also they have a smoking deal, get a 50oz beer for $15.00 and you keep the glass, and refills are $5.00. Well worth it"}
{"text":"Tasty Beers ina nice intimate atmosphere CHECK! AWESOME PIZZA, CHECK! GARLIC KNOTS TO DIE FOR, CHECK!!!!! 

The IPA here is one of the best in Vegas, it is well balanced with a wonderful hop aroma, and a nice hoppy finish!! The Heffe is also a very nice true to style Bavarian Heffe with hints of bubblegum and clove, and that twinge of banana in the finish.

I prefer the thin crust pie with buffalo Mozz on it, delicious!!! 

This is a sattelite location, and no brewing is done on site, but if you are down on fremont, and looking for a tasty adult Beverage, and some good greasy grub, this is your kind of place MERICA!!!"}
{"text":"I have been craving Chicago style pizza for a long while and for my 4 year work anniversary at Zappos, my co-workers took me to this place to celebrate.

It's a small venue, I like that it is split where you can smoke cigars on one side and non smoking on the other. 

We sat and in a very short time later, Bob, our amazing server was there to greet us and grab our drink orders.

I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the Fremont area! 

The Chicago style pizza was just what I wanted. The sauce is delicious, the mozzarella cheese oozes when you pull a slice, I love that!

The Filet Mignon sliders are amazing, you can literally cut into it with a fork, that's how tender they are!

I wasn't a fan of the chicken wings, they were over cooked and dry, so I wouldn't recommend ordering that.

The calamari & the quesadilla was alright, it doesn't really stand out. 

The customer service is amazing, request for Bob to help you out, the atmosphere is great, stop in and have fun and enjoy some good food!"}
{"text":"This is as close to Chicago as I'll get for now.  Such a grand theme outside and in.  I like the look.  I also like how they have tall cushioned booth seating.  It sorta keeps meal conversations with some privacy, although the ceilings are super high.  The brick walls are cool!

Yes Florence dear... Double tiered beer sampler and it turns like a carousel.  So neat :)  good flavor variety with their beer menu.  Guess which we liked?  And it's not wimpy just cuz they're not dark.  We prefer the fruity beers.  Except however, the one that literally tasted like coffee (shoot oh forgot the name).

Ooooh MUST TRY their prosciutto wrapped skewers!  I enjoyed it with the horseradish.  Yeah I like horseradish don't snicker at me... Ppptthhh.  I woulda if I coulda ordered anotha...

But we had pizza to work on.  Deep dish margarita pizza with chicken.  Delicious for sure.  The deep pan crust was its own - not my chalky dough type of preference.  It was good though.

Place is good for any reason to have pizza with anywhobees you want company with.  This includes young kids who like to repeat \"mom mom mom mom mom\" until the parent pays attention (not with our party).  Have a slice of pizza and chug a beer!  Not for the kid..."}
{"text":"This is such a gem! Pizza is fantastic, service is amazing, and it's fun to watch the casino floor! Did I mention the pizza was fantastic?"}
{"text":"Sitting here watching basketball and enjoying the decor. The staff is very helpful, and accessible, but don't feel the need to check on you every three minutes. Our waiter Billy is was good, and the manager seemed nice too. 

The food was stellar. Our group had pulled pork sliders, pulled pork mac n cheese, a miracle mile meat pizza and the pretzel bites. The sliders weren't spectacular, but certainly above average. The pretzel bites themselves weren't anything special, BUT, the dipping sauces (cheese and mustard) wwre AMAZING.
We had a thin crust pizza, and it was great.  Crust still had a little chewyness to it, and didn't seem like it was made on crackers like many thin crusts.

The root beer was really good (I think they make that in house too). I only had the Weizenheimer Bavarian wheat from the beer list, and as a wheat fan I have to say it was pretty good.

This was our first time here, but it certainly won't be our last."}
{"text":"I love this place. Used to live around the corner and would bring the kids for dinner. I think it's the best pizza. But it has to do with lots of great memories with family and friends. I'd get the 22oz Hef and the fat meat lovers pan pizza. The dough is great.  Just chewy enough with a hint of sweetness.  The wings were great too. Great times, great memories. This place is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Service: Pretty darn good.
Atmosphere: I like it.

Food: Overall, I like it. My four-stars is based on my overall opinion of the place. I have been here a bunch of times, but I haven't really checked in or reviewed it, so my notes here may make it look worse than my actual opinion. I will have to make more notes as I eat here again to round out my review, but for now, I am just reviewing tonight's meal.

Cheese steak: not so great. Not bad as a roast-beef sandwich, I guess, but not what I am looking for in a cheese steak. The meat is thinly sliced, but chewy. Shouldn't have mushrooms (in my opinion, but I wanted to try their version in the format it was offered). And the beer-cheese was okay, but not really what you want in a cheese-steak sandwich. Pass.

Burger: hubby says good.

Onion rings: at least they get the onions cooked all the way through, but the batter feels heavy with grease. Pass.

Macaroni salad: Not the worst I've had. I little too sweet, and it does have that metallic tang that so many mac salads have, although it is faint. I don't know why that flavor is there, but it's not good. Pass."}
{"text":"In my search for local brewed beer I was led here to Chicago Brewing Company. Chicago is one of the bigger breweries in the Las Vegas scene and pretty much anyone into craft beer has been or heard of this place. My review really just applies to happy hour so keep that in mind.

CBC features several standard beers along with a few rotating seasonal. The hefe, IPA, brown, stout and some others comprise the regular beers, keep an eye out for the Hawaiian Honey with an astounding 14% ABV. My personal favorite, the Hefe is true to it's German roots with a crisp wheat taste and golden color. Service is hit or miss during happy hour and may have to wave down a bartender to get your order in. 

Happy hour is M-F 3pm-7pm in either the upstairs or downstairs bars. I was a little disappointed that there is no late night happy hour which probably explains why this place is a ghost town after 8pm. They offer up $6 pitchers along with $2 14oz and $2.50 22oz. Great prices on awesome beer you can't get anywhere else in town. CBC is pretty weak on the food offerings, $6 for chicken fingers, a cheese pizza and garlic knots. Meh. The upstairs bar doubles as a cigar lounge so if second hand smoke isn't your thing, stay away."}
{"text":"Wow I wish we had come here early in our trip to Vegas, I had read about it but didn't go until our last night. This is a hidden gem at the back or the 4 Queens casino on Fremont st with excellent craft beer and tasty appys, and because it was happy hour (3pm - 6pm) they were half price, as well the beer $3 for a 14oz during happy hour. I would highly recommend the filet mignons sliders, generous helping of caramelized onions, and sautéed mushrooms. If all that wasn't enough the staff was very friendly and very passionate about beer. 
  My wife and I will definitely be back here on our next trip."}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company deserves two separate reviews - 1 for the beer and 1 for the food.

The beer was surprisingly good.  When restaurants also have an extensive menu, I am usually a little apprehensive about the quality of the beer.  However, the IPA at Chicago Brewing Company was rather good.  I tried a sampler and the Belgian was a little above average, the IPA was very good, and the rest were as anticipated.  

The food was pub food catered to a Chicago audience.  We had a deep dish pizza which wasn't too bad, as well as a baked pasta, nachos, and wings.  The wings could have been spicier but tasted solid nonetheless. 

I heard they had some football specials so if you happen to swing by on a Sunday, try the IPA and maybe the wings or pizza."}
{"text":"A limited but good beer selection.  Since I collect pint glasses and brewery tee shirts, I had to give Chicago Beer Company a try.  My husband is a wine lover, we were happy to see that they had his wine of choice!Since it is located in the Four Queens Casino, I was happy to see that smoking and non-smoking sections were in two separate sections.  The bartenders were helpful and knowledgeable when advising me on beer choices!  I am glad that I gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Went in for some food on a Thursday night at 7pm. I should have taken it as a bad sign when there were only 3 other tables with people at them. I ordered the black and blue sliders which were about the most disgusting hamburgers Ive ever eaten in my life. Burger was overcooked the caramelized onion was actually so caramelized it was now candied onion. The whole mess was completely inedible. I just paid and left 2 of 3 sliders sitting on the plate. Do not come here for the food.  The rootbeer and service were actually pretty good but the food was about the worst thing Ive ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (who's from Chicago) & I came here from Santa Barbara (we were visiting Vegas) to watch his Chicago Blackhawks vs. New Jersey Devils & it was such an awesome experience!  We ordered the Tower of Beer sampler, garlic knots, & deep dish pizza.  Everything was great!  From the food to the wait staff, it was such a laidback atmosphere. To top it all off, the Chicago Blackhawks won & went on to win the Stanley Cup!  My boyfriend was so happy lol."}
{"text":"This place is crazy cheap and it is 24 hours!  I rarely come out to bars but this is a pretty nice bar that isn't too sketch and has plenty of sitting space.  I hate when I have to stand the whole night waiting for a stool.  This place has plenty of tables downstairs and lots of couches and seats upstairs too.  Definitely a good spot to hang out.  Fireball shots are only $6 each!  Cost-effective if you ask me."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick cheap lunch (fuel)....
I left with a T-shirt and a to-go cup of Stout.

The ambience lacks pizazz, but we sat at the casino-view table for prime people- watching (the joint is elevated a little bit above the casino so the view is good).

The sandwich wrap I had was decent, and huge enough to share.
Our servier was friendly and quick.

Try the beer flight...it's a great deal, and this place actually brews some fairley decent brew.  

FYI
There's a cigar bar attached to it, so you might wanna sniff before you sit."}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company... Wow I'm not really sure what happened to this place... Years ago they had amazing food and amazing service now I refuse to go because the service is terrible and the food is even worse the atmosphere in this place isn't even good anymore"}
{"text":"Beer was good ....  that's about it.   
We went during happy hour , to try out their own beer brews and have a little food.  My wife and i were looking for new and were HOPING this place would be good.   We were unhappy. 

We got the chips and salsa , it came with some sort of cheese sauce.  Kinda tasted like that stuff you get in a glass jar ( tostitos ? ) from the grocery store. 

I ordered a steak sandwich with onion rings.  I think i got 5 onion rings ... not worth the upcharge , the steak sandwich was good however , it was literally a whole steak thrown on a peice of bread .....  Anytime i have ever had a steak sandwhich before .. they usually slice it at least.   

My wife ordered a ruben ... the waitress brought out my sandwhich and basically told us my wife would have to wait for hers since another waitress took her food on accident . ...  dont they put tickets next to the food for this exact reason ?  It took nearly another 15 minutes. By the time she got her food , mine was almost cold as i didnt want to eat and make my wife sit there while i was eating. 

We did get an apology out of the waitress , but thats it.   I dont think i expect free food or discounts for everything , but there are certain things that you would want to take care of your customers with , and this was it. 

Im sorry but first impression like this is hard to break .. will not be back."}
{"text":"Tucked in the Queens hotel on Fremont st. The pizza was just okay! It wasn't nearly close to anything I've ever had, but it isn't terrible either. The fries here though, are addicting!! The service was also great, which always makes things more pleasant. The ambience here is a bit dark. You can see the Queens casino floor from inside the restaurant, which you'll also have to walk through for the restroom bc the restaurant does not have their own. This is also a cigar bar it looked like. They had cigars in the cases and the bar had gambling machines as well! Wouldn't see myself here again unless I'm starving and walking through Fremont St."}
{"text":"I've visited Chicago Brewing Co. various times for business lunches, nighttime drinks at the bar area, and even for a group fantasy hockey draft event. The service in this place is superb. The food is quite good as well and I believe they offer daily lunch specials. So far I have had both the pozole soup/pizza combo and the fish and chips (each lunch special was $10). The soup was very good, pizza was cooked well, and the fish and chips were spot on but the portion size left a bit to be desired. The craft beers here are extraordinary. You'd be hard pressed to find one you didn't enjoy! From pale ales to IPAs to blonde ales, they typically have the perfect beverage for any pallet. Boasting upstairs and downstairs bar areas to enjoy these custom brews in addition to a cigar smoking area with cigars readily available for purchase, makes Chicago Brewing Company one of the coolest spots to hit for a night out away from the strip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Love the deep dish and beer selection."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer prices, and cozy atmosphere.

Food-Good, but nothing special. We ordered 6 sliders...3 Black n Blue and 3 Filet Mignon, plus a order of their steakhouse fries. Black n Blue had more flavor in my opinion; Filets were too salty. Fries were decent, but the cheese on them was GOOD! Beer was good as well and I liked their selection. 

Prices-Food was average, but their beer was cheap! 60 oz for $6...how could you go wrong!??

Atmosphere-Cozy almost at
home feel for the dining area. I think made the service better. Bar was a different story. Just not my thing to eat in areas with smoke. Just drinking? Sure.

Overall, I would definitely go back to Chicago Brewing Co., but only for their cheap beer."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game on the tv, drink, and smoke a cigar or two. I liked the deep dish pizza and the appetizers. So great atmosphere, food, and drinks. Just be warned its a cigar bar too. So don't be surprised to see people smoking a stick."}
{"text":"Some of the best beer you will get in Vegas. I love the Old Town Brown and the Weizenheimer. The garlic knots are excellent and they are incredibly cheap at happy hour.  The deep dish pizza is good but I don't think it's great. It pretty much falls completely apart when you try to get a slice. The bartenders are always cool friendly people but be warned, you may be waiting a long time for a beer. The service is always very slow despite the friendly staff.  You could be the only person in the entire bar and still be waiting with an empty glass. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. A great pregame spot when you want to hang out downtown."}
{"text":"Okay place to grab a beer and watch the game. The food is average and prices are okay not to pricey but not cheap."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review, because if it were a bar/brewery only, I would EASILY give them 4 stars. I think their beer is pretty solid, and the happy hours prices are excellent. There are a few things that irked me, but we'll get to them. 

I was here with a pretty large party, so I suppose you should take that into account. Service wasn't exceptional, and maybe serving a large party affects that somewhat. The manager of the restaurant was extremely polite and accomodating, and I appreciate that. I don't regret celebrating here at all-- I'm glad I chose this place. I probably could have done just as well picking a big ol' corporate BJ's brewery or a Yardhouse, but as always, I give preference to smaller businesses and experience their unique spin on food. 

I tried their standard pale, which was very smooth but perhaps a bit uninspiring. Perhaps it could have been a bit more floral but it was very easy to drink and that is a plus. Their amber is sweet and comforting. Better than a bottle of Fat Tire no doubt. I also tried their brown ale. Slightly less malty than a New Castle, but again, fairly easy to drink. Trying these beers was fun and I would like to try more of them. The coconut porter looks especially tempting, so I'll have to save that for next time.

My food experience wasn't phenomenal, but it was decent enough I suppose. I ordered the italian beef sandwich, because my understanding is that its' an authentic Chicago food item. The meat was perhaps a tad more well done than I would have liked, and salty, but the Au Jois was adequate. The macaroni salad was pretty standard. The chicago pizza that others ordered looked pretty agreeable, and the Reuben looked delicious-- I think I will choose it next time. 

I think it's a bit silly that happy hour is not allowed in the dining area. Several from my party walked over to the bar and brought back beers at a much better price than the rest of us who had to order at full price. I don't quite see the purpose of this policy, but hey it's not my business. 
For my birthday, a complementary chocolate pizookie was served.  I am partial to chocolate but it was honestly pretty damn good, and I do appreciate gestures such as this. 

So how does this place stack up to a BJ's or Yardhouse? Probably about even. I'd give them a 3.5, rounded up to 4 because of that personal touch, and the novelty of brewing their own beers. I WOULD certainly recommend this place for an event , just manage your expectations I suppose. It was a cool looking, fun environment to celebrate in and I thank them for helping me have a fun night."}
{"text":"This is a must stop whenever I am in Vegas. The pizza is freaking awesome, I love the filet mignon sliders, and the beer is pretty damn good. I stopped in earlier this week and tried their seasonal beer - Belgian Saison. Total thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Female bartender with large blonde hair (Shelly?), has been rather rude and giving poor service as of late. Makes it easier to pass it up as well because the beer selection has been slipping. With all the other new brewpubs popping up, I think they mainly rely on their gambling barflies rather than their product."}
{"text":"This was my first and sadly my last time here! A friend of mine who has eaten there on several prior occasions suggested the place. Since she spoke so highly of it, I really wanted to try it.

At first glance, I was very impressed with the decor, but that's about the only thing that impressed me. My dining companion said that she only gets one thing when she dines at Chicago Brewing Company -- the Shrimp Cocktail. When they brought her plate of shrimp out(it was previously served in a cocktail glass), the first thing she said to me was \"the shrimp are smaller and the price went up since the last time I ate here.\"

I wanted to try a Chicago Style Pizza and so I ordered one. The first one came out, I didn't like the sauce they used although the toppings were quite tasty (bacon and chicken) We asked if they would re-make the pizza this time using a white sauce and they obliged. The second one came out but was obviously under cooked. I had one piece of each pizza, a coke and just because I didn't eat much I ordered a root beer float.

My companion and I both left unsatisfied. Within less than an hour, I became physically ill. From reading the reviews here it seems like most of the people like the place but that was not our experience. Unfortunately, I can't agree with everyone else this time. In my opinion the food is mediocre at best and priced a bit on the high side. A complete and total waste of $40 and talk about something that will ruin someones day? Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I have posted an accurate, fair review. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hope your experience (if you decide to go here) is leaps and bounds better than mine was!

If the business owner is willing and should happen to see this review; I would graciously accept a refund but I don't believe you could ever convince me to return."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions when it comes to giving this place my rating. When I first went there it was perfect and I had nothing negative to say at all. Then the last 2 times I was there the food was cold and their fries were old and stale, and there booze there is, in my opinion, kinda weird tasting."}
{"text":"Not bad but most of this is smoking video porker.  Had the chicken enchilada soup, which paired nicely with the sun down stout, on nitro."}
{"text":"This is a classic homestyle pub where you always feel welcome when you walk in. The food is well-made, reasonably priced and seasoned well. We sat at the bar and it wasn't too loud - it wasn't too smoky and it was friendly. The bartenders were both personable and very attentive.I don't suggest gambling here as the machines were very greedy. 

My understanding is that there is a cigar bar upstairs since I don't smoke cigars I didn't opt to check it out. However, I did notice there was a lot of traffic going up the stairs to that cigar bar, which I shall take as a positive sign.

I suggest this little gem for the nights when you just want to hang with friend, have a beer and relax."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked after seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted on yelp. Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the \"Buffalo Chicken Wrap\" priced at $10 and the \"South Side Cheese Steak\" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for \"Slot August Nights\" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details."}
{"text":"Been to NYC and, the pizza here is better than 90 percent of what Ive had in the big apple. Amazing deep dish pizzas that leave you wanting more....but your belly will bust!"}
{"text":"This won't take long.

It seriously was just MEH. Nothing to get excited over. Nothing bad. Nothing great. Just, MEH!"}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and fell in love with it. Great home brews, pizza and the flights they have aren't 4 little 2 oz pours, they are 8-12 glasses. awesome. great staff and great price. will def. be back"}
{"text":"came here with some buddies after finding out about this place on thrillist. the food was great. we ordered some wings and fried calamari for appetizers. then we each ordered our own deep dish pizzas which were extremely delicious! the waitress, I can't remember her name but she was very pretty and was really great. I noticed that she didn't write a single thing down and got every single aspect of our order correct. I thought that was pretty amazing. we ordered the hef, it wasn't the greatest hef I've had, it was a little flat and light, wish we had time to try more of their beers. will definitely go back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My nephew took my wife and I there and it brought back some old school memories. The food was very good it also had a cigar lounge and the beer very tasty tasty. My very first stop when I hit Vegas again,"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem in downtown -- it's tucked away in a corner of the Four Queens and it's very easy to miss.

Absolutely amazing pizza.  The 9 inch personal deep dish with all the meats is only $10 and is huge.  It's so good.  Varying soft & crunchy crust, not too oily, and just a slight bit of sweetness to the sauce.

Service was fine even though it was kinda busy because of sports."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and the service is always amazing. Bella has been my server the last couple times and she's absolutely wonderful. She helped me find my favorite beer! The garlic knots are soooooo delicious. 10/10 love this place."}
{"text":"Horrible example of deep dish or any pizza for that matter. Would probably go to Dominos before ever come back here."}
{"text":"It's getting downgraded and fast - 2 stars.

Listen people, we understand that times are tough - their tough on us too. But if you're going to cut back on your happy-hour offerings, don't use the lame excuse that it because there were too many drunks making trouble.

No more $10 yard beer specials and who knows what else was lost in this recent management decision.

If you cant manage your restaurant and its patrons, just close down and make room for someone who can."}
{"text":"Been here three of four times now. excellent beer, nice little place, sit smoke a cigar, get away from the slots for a time. I'd definitely go here again. Oh and Ask for Kimmie."}
{"text":"Come here for the beer only. The food we had was awful. We had the chicken wings as appetizers. They were not cooked well. She had the burger. The fries were the only good thing. I had a sandwich with 3 types of meat. Too salty and on one of the bites I heard a hard crack sound.  It was a bone. Her soda was watered down. Like I said the beer was the only thing good."}
{"text":"First time here. It's separated into a bar and restaurant area. No smoking in the restaurant area.

Not many TVs in either area. Could be the only down side.  

The beers are great and cheap during happy hour. The salads are made to order and good sized.  

Nadine was a great waitress. No conplaints. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Continue my night by las Vegas street and I found this cozy brewery sport bar nice service which provide me with some beer tastes so I can have the right choice to drink food was a little dry but good at the end I would come back probably."}
{"text":"What a great place. My father and I came here Friday from San Diego around 2:30 and had a great time. Ordered the chicken fingers as an appetizer and had a thin crust pizza for lunch. Food was great. Service was even better. Our server/bartender Tiffany i believe but receipt says Kimber was off the charts great. She greeted us with an awesome smile and followed through with a great  customer service passion. She should be applauded. About 5'9 Brunette lady. Awesome smile. Really good. 
Thanks
William

{"text":"The food here is actually pretty good. It's some of that food bar food that hits the spot in those clutch moments of hunger and you're not sure what to eat. I have not been disappointed by anything I've ordered, though I have had friends who have (I think they just didn't know what they actually wanted).

Definitely give it a try! May not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go with my family we get
Pizza and it is always good. Good costumer service. But it always smells like smoke I thought that was from the bar. Other than that it is a good place to eat at!!!"}
{"text":"Difficult place to get to since you either go up the stairs to the third floor or take the Elevator to the third floor and walk through Magnolias restaurant which is a very tight walk through with all the tables and chairs. Once inside the restaurant which is very small you can sit on the 21 and over side or the family section. Food is pretty good and the prices reasonable. I had the Filet Mignon sliders which were good, but my family had the spicy chicken sandwich and meat pizza. My family said the spicy chicken sandwich was very delicious and the Pizza was awesome! I had the 9.00 dollar beer sampler which was more than enough beer! I highly recommend this place. Remember it's in the Four Queens casino."}
{"text":"I went here on Fourth of July around 9 o'clock not expecting it to be busy and it was not, I figured everyone was doing their own thing. I was craving some great cracker thin, crispy style pizza. We ordered the artichoke dip to start. It had a nice cheesy layer on the top, which was piping hot, but the inside of the dip was not that hot, which leads me to believe this thing came straight from the freezer. Aside from it being unbelievably salty, the flavor was just bland. We also ordered the veggie thin crust pizza, that looked super nice but the only parts of the crust that were crispy were the edges, they didn't cook it long enough for the whole pizza crust to crisp throughout. The veggies seemed fresh enough, but there was barely any cheese and I felt like the sauce they used came straight from a can. The food was just meh, but the server was nice and they had a decent beer selection. My friend also left his phone there and they were honest and kept it at the bar for us. I would maybe consider going back to drink at the bar, but probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"Just ok, not much to write home about. Dark in here and only 2 tv's weird for a s bar that says its a sports bar. 
Had a club sandwich we split average price. Played video poker, asked if our drinks were comped cause we are playing, they adjusted the bill.
Maybe more a local place as the one server looked so unhappy to see us."}
{"text":"First, the food here was excellent. I really enjoyed my club sandwich, and being a club sandwich aficionado, that means it must be good.

The beer could have been better. They claim a lot of awards, but they don't seem to be very recent. Small menu and nothing was really \"wow.\""}
{"text":"This place has thee best deep dish pizza I've ever had! All of the ingredients were super fresh & we always have the friendliest servers. We went close to closing time & they still let us sit & eat & made us feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to grab a beer late at night and walked into this place around 10:30. I loved their beer (hence the 1 star instead of 0), but the customer service was simply horrible. Our host didn't give us the drink menu at first and we made eye contacts with him to ask for one, but he looked at us and did not come back until quite a few minutes later - although there was only one other table in the hall. When we tried asking him a question about the menu he cut me off mid-sentence with \"i'm not your server.\" The manner in which he talked to us was clearly very rude and unprofessional as a host. Our server also had so much attitude and sarcasm in her tone. She spilled some of our beer on the floor and table as she brought them over, and when we asked her to repeat which one was which she said something along the line of \"ask me later unless you want to keep the wet table\" as she went to grab something to wipe the table with.
We felt bad for walking in close to closing time and tried to figure out why everyone was so displeased, and tried to stay nice and polite as much as possible to make up for whatever that was, but were unable to identify/solve it. I may return to this place in the future, but will surely be afraid that something like this may happen again."}
{"text":"Here in town visiting a relative in the hospital. First impression of this place gave it a, comfy, old times feel.

Our hostess and server were both very friendly, the menu had a great selection, I had the Meatball Sliders. It was delicious! It didn't take very long for our food to come out and the waitress was very attentive. I would defiantly come back here!"}
{"text":"Deep.Dish.Pizza. 

Need I say more?! Give it a try! Soooo yum. I was literally swimming in cheese. They're super generous lol. 
Beers were okay. They seem to have the same beers on tap, nothing crazy special. The flight is a good deal if you're looking to just quench your thirst."}
{"text":"You can't beat this for the money. Great chicken fingers and pizza."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place on every Vegas visit for years, this week we came nearly every day. I love the deep dish pizza. My husband loves that one side allows cigars, so he can watch sports and have a cigar. Great service from Mike and Bob. Great prices on beer and 1/2-price apps weekdays from 3 to 6."}
{"text":"I had been coming here since this place opened its doors....but do not come here anymore.

The quality of the beer has become a damn joke and management has completely lost it.

It is really sad to see one of the breweries we had here in Vegas that used to be so great....fall to be so low. And please understand...used to be great..REALLY GREAT and I used to be here 3-4 times a week.

I had waited to do this review.....but it seems to just get worse. It's really sad"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place now and then for years, always meaning to stop in and check it out.Well, the wait is over, today I finally parked and went in, ready for what awaited us...
Interesting layout. You walk in, straight ahead is what I'd call the well lit main dining area, the the left behind the doors is the darker bar area, can get food in there too, then upstairs from that is the cigar room. We choose the bar area, sat at a table and was immediately served by a friendly woman. Not bad so far. Menu is the pretty standard bar food, peppered with 'Chicago' styled food, pizza, sandwiches, etc. I tried a Ramblin Reck amber ale, a very tasty house draft, highly recommended. Also ordered the Chicago Italian Beef and the wife got a cheese pizza.
The issue here was the food service. A lot of what we ordered came out wrong, I would not recommend the coleslaw (too dry, like cabbage and nothing else) nor the fries (limp). The pizza was good as was the Italian beef. 
I may give it another shot one day, at the very least, to enjoy a few of those Ramblin Recks."}
{"text":"I like this place. Happy Hour is from 4p to 7p all week; 11p to 1a on Sunday-Thursday.

Noise is tolerable, and there are a few tables with outlets nearby if you're looking for a place to work.

Nice building, nice folks, beer decent.  Happy Hour is the best value.  Can't say I've ever had the food here."}
{"text":"Great place to recharge! The staff is super friendly in a not fake way and the bar food is actually really great! I have been to Vegas tons of times but never to old town and I'll be back now. It's a great place to grab a drink and good food and actually be able to sit. The filet mignon sliders, wings, and mozzarella sticks are yum! Plus check out the happy hour!!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Service for happy hour was pretty nonexistent. Yes, I know I am ordering one beer and one appetizer but that's why it's happy hour--some people choose to get happier than others, and you still have to wait on me. $5.40 is ultra-cheap for a beer and an appie, but we were there for a couple hours and my friend (who was of the getting-happier variety) had to wave down the bartender who would pass us on his way to and from the other happier tables. Also, the loft is a cigar bar, which I didn't know going into it. I'm not that bothered by that type of smoke but some people might be.

I did have a blueberry beer which I did like a lot, but it would have led to a severe case of gutrot were I to have had more than one. My friend kept downing their IPA and believe me, her happy hour mission was accomplished."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!

The waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!

As most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!

I asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.

To wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!

After a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!

So....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.

I'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!

Overall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!

Other things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!

Will I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, Buffalo sliders tasted like puuure salt sweet potatoe fries tastes burnt and hard as a rock, servers were rude and non helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to the brewery a few times and enjoyed it the fruit flavored blueberry beer is really good so ordered the beer the bare tender told me we are all out of any fruity beers. I seriously doubted it. Cus the guy next to him said under his breath keep that fruity shit downstairs. How are you of of beer at a brewery what a joke. 

Being that it has a Chicago name most would assume it's a Chicago sports friendly bar. Well the other night during the Chicago Hockey game there were plenty of Chicago fans I jokingly said to the bartender hey were in a Chicago bar why aren't you a Chicago fan?! 

Wow the attitude I got from the bartender and the customer at the bar was amazing. He responded this isn't a Chicago bar!!  I will never return there again used to be my go to spot to watch football games. 

Just a price of advice have Chicago friendly bartenders at least support the name. Jeez. I felt like I was in LA with the way they acted."}
{"text":"Best Sunday football spot that we have found over 15+ years 

Lots of fun 
Great beer 
Great bar 
Great bartenders 

Can't go wrong spot"}
{"text":"This was our first experience here and it's walking distance so we decided to try it out. 

What an awesome experience !! The bartender who helped us, she was too cool! Friendly, personable and you could easily tell by how she interacted with everyone, she's been there a while and many there in the bar are local. 

We had a great meal; and thought we were taking home food but nope! Too good and we continued to nibble until it was gone.. the steak was excellent! The green beans with red bell  pepper so tasty and the margarita pizza  yummy!! 

Overall a great experience and we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Cant beat 24hours.  I had sliders with caramelized onions and blue cheese... delicious. Their IPA isnt half bad either."}
{"text":"Yay! I am so very happy that we loved this place. 

There's a very relaxed environment, I love that you can look right into the kitchen all the while following your team on the flat screens. We ate in the main dining room, downstairs and didn't venture around - but it was a great experience. 

I had the Strawberry Harvest Wheat brew and it was delightful, not overpowering and quite refreshing. I was interested in the steak sandwich; however, the waiter talked me into the club sandwich. The portion was huge - which is good for taking home, but the club itself was so large that I couldn't actually take a bite. It was cut into quarters, and speared with a long toothpick - but there wasn't a good way to take a bite of it. I ended up with a handful of food that I just had to kind of gently shove into my mouth. I was NOT happy with it. My husbands hot pastrami sandwich was phenomenal! 

We will absolutely be back to try this out again; although I will definitely not be getting the club sandwich. :)"}
{"text":"These guys are the shit! They serve amazing food and drinks, they're extremely friendly, quick and efficient. This place is a must."}
{"text":"This tucked away place is a favorite of mine because of how chill the bartenders are and my favorite coconut shrimp"}
{"text":"I've had a restaurant.com GC for Chicago Brewery for about 6 months as I knew Id eventually find myself hungry in the middle of the night. Last night was that night.

They had only their late night menu available, but there were plenty of options available.  My girlfriend and I ordered the filet mignon sliders, garlic knots, and chicken fingers. All were well above average, but not amazing enough to come back exclusively for.  We didn't get to try the pizza because of the late night menu, but I remember it being pretty darn good.

We also had the beer sampler... I'm not much of a beer drinker but all their beers were pretty good. The sampler was more than enough beer for the both of us."}
{"text":"if you are looking for a place to have a drink, eat some good bar food, maybe watch a game and smoke a cigar this is the place for you.  Great place to grab some drinks with some friends and munch on some good food.  I have been here plenty of times and have always had a pleasant time."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and chicken wings.  Service can be spotty and the bar area can get really smokey with drunk tourists smoking cigars.  Still, it's darn good."}
{"text":"ANOTHER great speed lunch in our lunch break!   Thank you guys AGAIN!  In and out in 40 mins with time to chill!  Fresh, Hot and killer lunch special!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to come and relax and have a couple of house microbrews. Had never eaten here before until last Thursday. The service was pretty good, attentive and fast. The food was pretty good as well. Had the veggie pizza and it was to die for. Typically don't take leftovers home, but did this time because the pizza was so good. 

Now I wont just look at this place as a great place to have a good beer on the weekend or after work. I will consider it for a good lunch or dinner spot as well. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Ken M. who organized an UYE here tonight, I got to try their new wild game sliders.  They were added to the menu last fall.  The six sliders are made from the following game animals:  alligator, antelope, buffalo, jackalope (rabbit and antelope meat mixed together), rabbit and wild boar.  They come 3 for $16 (must be all one kind of meat) or a sampler platter of all 6 for $30.

Three of us shared the sampler and we each had a taste of all 6 meats.  My rating would be from best to least: Rabbit, wild boar, alligator, antelope, jackalope, and bison.  All had sauces to enhance the flavors of the meat.  For example, the wild boar had red currant jelly and sharp cheddar cheese while alligator had a remoulade sauce and a fried egg.  There was a toothpick to break the yolk and make the alligator meat really flavorful!  The platter also came with some waffle cut sweet potato fries which were really yam fries--not sweet potato.  This was a good choice, and I'm glad Tony and Clint shared the sampler with me.

Service was good, and I had a mug of their on site brewed root beer.  Another great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) with a nice bunch of people at a good place.

{"text":"My wife and I shared the Garlic Knots and Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Food was amazing and more than enough for both of us.  We'll worth it!"}
{"text":"It's my neighborhood favorite bar always a great time always great service never a dull moment here"}
{"text":"In the interest of full-disclosure, this was my first visit here and I have not had another since. 

Overall atmosphere was less than impressive. Service was average, but nothing worth coming back for. The beer was fine, but also nothing worth making a specific trip back for. 

Being huge fans of BBQ chicken pizzas, we tried their version - the Brew BQ Chicken Pizza. I imagine the chicken used is the pre-cooked, sliced strips you can buy at the grocery store (which, if you've ever had, is terrible). We picked most of it off or even had to just spit it on the plate. It lacked an adequate amount of sauce and the crust was about as good as crunchy cardboard. 

Not saying this place doesn't have other tasty options, but I certainly won't be back to try and find them."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place, for good pizza. Error - its not good its GREAT
Clearly, one of the best pizza in LV. My colleague and I shared the Chicken White Pizza - Thin Crust - boy its was spot on - really high quality ingredients and well cooked -  I will return for take-out - only negative its in a pretty run down casino which is horribly noisy
Highly recommended to try this place out for Pizza
Good work by team there"}
{"text":"A neighborhood brew-pub, I have driven by several times and finally decided to stop in after reading all the positive reviews.  This review is for the bar menu only, I didn't get a chance to review the beer/alcohol.  

The service was the stand out this time.  The waitress who initially helped me told me to what a few minutes to order, that way I would get happy hour prices.  I thought that was very nice of her.

The food unfortunately was a let down.  I ordered the BBQ chicken fingers, greek salad, and, of course, ice tea.  The chicen fingers were, meh, nothing special.  The BBQ didn't add anything to it.  If anything, it took away from the dish since it clashed with the breading on the chicken.  The celery salad was unique and tasty.  I wish they didn't take it away so soon.  The greek salad had a little too much dressing.

I am sure if I had a chance to review the alcohol offerings along with the bar food I would have given this place more stars, especially during happy hour.  But if you are just going for happy hour food, there are better brew-pubs out there."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and delicious food. I wish every place on the strip provided even half of the service this place does. One guy working the bar, taking orders, running food, refills and not one huff or puff - just a smile. Can't wait to come back !!"}
{"text":"We live within walking distance of this place, which is one of the reasons we initially tried it! The food is good! Love the Greek salad and the chicken cordon blue sliders. The deep dish pizzas are excellent and very filling! On Sunday's, they sometimes make a ravioli bolognese. It is unreal! The only thing we don't like here are their burgers. They are a tad too greasy for us. But other than that, we love it here!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place. Good microbrewery and great food. Yesterday, I had a chicken sandwich that blew my mind. It was gigantic and so good that it puts Chick-fil-A to shame. I washed it down with a hardway IPA. Can't go wrong here.

I have had a waitress in the past who seemed to always had a chip on her shoulder. Not sure if she still works there or not. She was just unpleasant to have as a waitress but It was over a year or so ago I was last here. However, yesterday we had someone named Tara who was really sweet and nice. 

I know all the food is pretty fresh. If it's available the coco for coconuts porter is amazing.  Also I'd highly recommend the ribeye sandwich ( it's huge) , any of the burgers, chicken sandwich, and the New England clam chowder( I think it's a Friday night thing).  Also they make a ghost pepper hot sauce that's not on the menu if you like your wings scorching. 

Anyways for the price, you can't go wrong here honestly."}
{"text":"On the few times a year I am out late, this is a dependable place to get okay food and a drink before heading home.

I am not a fan of their beers, but they have plenty of other beers in bottles.

I like the ghost wings and pizzas.

I would go to BJ's over this place during the day, but a good place to go ending a night out."}
{"text":"I have only had the bar menu, but I like the Chicken Fingers.  The chicken fingers tossed in ghost sauce are terribly spicy and are not worth ordering, but definitely get a side of  ghost sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"I read some great reviews several months back and but it on my backburner to try.  Looking in the most recent reviews today I should have checked out the place sooner.  Really, a borderline 3 for this place.

We got there on a Friday night and it was a bit packed.  Decor is nice, dark, lots of brick.  Liked seeing the huge vats for their in house microbrews, real plus.  But really folks, does it take you 10 minutes to acknowledge that we might need a place to sit?  Naughty, naughty you hostess you!  On a Friday night you know business will pick up so be on the ready!

After finally getting seated we were greeted by our server.  Nice guy.  Told him we had never been there before so he showed us the menu and told us about their house microbrews and some of his favorites.  I told him I like dark beers like Guiness but I also don't mind a more medium brew like a Newcastle.  He told me I should have both!  His suggestion: 1/2 of their Old Town Brown and 1/2 of their Black Star Stout!  Also known in many places as a Black and Tan!  At $5 for a 22 oz. glass how could I go wrong?  Turned out to be a great choice, malty beer with chocolate notes, and a light bitter finish.  Fantastic!

I get around to looking into the menu and behold what do I see?  Chicago's master brewer...is a Filipino!  Graduate from UNLV no less!  That's it...go Filipino go!  Nice job Mr. Pascual on making some killer beer!  Makin' our Asian community strong, one person at a time.  Glad he got a page for him on the menu.  

On to the dinner menu, lots of variety!  Definitely bar food in the works for sure.  Appetizers looked appealing, garlic knots, onion rings, chicken tenders, brew wings, calamari, mussels, and clams.  So much to choose from.  If I had been there in time for happy hour we would have sampled some of these.  Menu has a diverse selection, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, entrees, and pizzas both Chicago deep dish and thin crust.  They even have a section devoted to their popular sliders.

We thought about getting a specialty Chicago deep dish pizza at first but it was a bit pricy at $14 for a 9\" (man did they look tiny sitting on the warming line) and $24 for a 14\".  You can also build your own deep dish pizza if you like.  Maybe next time!

The lady and I both ended up getting sandwiches from their menu.  She got the Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($10) with thin pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and honey mustard on marble rye bread.  I got the Southside Cheesesteak ($10) with peppers, mushrooms, and onions on a French roll with their signature beer cheese sauce.  The lady had onion rings, and I had fries (asked for them to be well done).

The verdict?  Food was ah.  It was ok, but nothing to really write home about.  Nothing was really all that special.  Her pastrami sandwich was alright, but it wasn't exactly overflowing with meat, and the coleslaw was a bit bland.  The onion rings didn't seem super fresh, do I detect from a bag and not hand battered?  Oh goodness I hope not.  My cheesesteak was fine (I've had better), their signature beer cheese sauce had a hint of beer but mostly tasted like basic Cheez Whiz to me.  Does no one know how to toast the inside of bread before putting the meat on it?  That crunch makes a world of difference.  My fries on the other hand were very good.  Super crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  

An ok experience overall.  Hostess could have been better, but our server was A-OK.  I must go back just to sample more of their beers!  The food though, might need some improvement.  Plus a star though for their Filipino master brewer!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant all the time, so I'm not sure why it took so long to write this review.  Anyway, there is no better deep dish pizza in Las Vegas.  My wife and I always get the Hawaiian and it never disappoints.  Note:  this pizza isn't for health nuts, so if you're on a diet I would avoid it.  The 9\" is the perfect size for two and, though it looks small, it will fill you up.  Chicago Brewing also has excellent beer, with 4-5 standards that they serve all year and some wonderful seasonals.  Last night, I tried the Fauxlanders Red (a sour) and it was outstanding.  For a casual night out with the family or a friend, this is the perfect spot.  Staff is friendly but not suffocating and they have a nice small patio out back.  You can fill up your growlers here too."}
{"text":"Came in 6:40 for dinner after a hike with my girlfriend, wanting to try the beer and deep dish. We sat ourselves at a table in the mostly empty, but fairly smokey bar area. Server rushed over the let us know we had 20 minutes left in the happy hour and took our orders right away. I tried the house IPA and it was very good. Meatballs we're good as well but garlic knots we're garlicy and great, with ample marinara for dipping. I tried a windy City supreme deep dish and it was good, not Chicago, but not bad for Vegas. Overall would come back for a beer and some grub."}
{"text":"Disgusting and awful.  Their \"Chicago deep dish\"  was a watery mess.  It's obvious this is a gambling establishment and not actually there for good food."}
{"text":"Never EVER will I go to Chicago Brewing Company after my experience tonight. I had a bad experience here last month when they completely overlooked a 40-person birthday reservation with no staff to assist and a server that would only stay upon the promise of \"being taken care of,\" but tonight topped the charts for the WORST service I have ever received anywhere. 

I decided to go back to try again, as I had been sent a $100 gift certificate by management for the last experience I had. 

The host, Destiny, became very visibly upset as she literally pushed me aside, through my group to walk us to our table. We had only walked a few feet from the hosts booth and were all so confused why she suddenly seemed so angry, as she had basically ignored us upon walking in. As we approached the table that she was throwing our menus down at, I proceeded to ask her if there was something that we did to upset her. She responded with, \"I don't appreciate when people walk ahead of me that I am seating. I'm the host!\"  

Destiny, you work in the service industry as the front of house staff. You set the tone for your guest's experience and you are the LASTING IMPRESSION of the business. If you get that upset over something so minuscule, work in a cubicle and don't plague mankind with your terrible attitude. 

Never again, I'm in disbelief that a business could be run so poorly. You have just lost a LOT of business. And I gave the $100 worth of gift certificates to guests in your restaurant. Cheers to even more business lost for you guys tonight."}
{"text":"This is another spot in Vegas that my wife and I frequented often. During the week their happy hour is great, with a 22 oz. tall beer for $4. The staff has always been friendly, though there seemed to be a lot of turnover the last time we were there.

While we always sat on their back patio, they do have a large inside, a smoking bar section, and an upstairs for private parties and events."}
{"text":"Recently visited the boy he has to try out one or two of their crafted microbrew beers.
The ball was half-full yet they have two possibly three bartenders behind the bar. I had to wait about five minutes if not more, to order a beer. 
The bartenders, what children that work there, with busy playing Games with each other or chatting with you all the customers and not paying attention to that job.
With so many choices in this town, this is not one that will be on my list of places to return to. I think management has dropped the ball by not paying attention to their business."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes at a table for service, another 5 minutes at the bar before ordering a flight of beer, and waited ten more minutes for it to be made. It wasn't the servers/bartenders fault though. Management decided to have him bartend/serve/run food/and apparently manage the whole place for lunch on a Thursday. Apparently they have 2 chefs to stand around in the kitchen though. The beer was good but come on. ... This place is located in a casino, wtf?"}
{"text":"So last night 13 Biking Las Vegas crew members assembled at the CBC for a birthday celebration.  Ample parking in a well lit lot.   There is a bar when you first enter so you get a whiff of cigarette smoke, but it's not too bad.  Just noticeable.  The Hostess was nice.  We were seated and as our group grew, they were very accommodating bringing an additional table and chairs without any indications of hardship.  It was like you were family.  Alex was our Rock Star Waitress.  Funny, outgoing, fun, gracious and kind.  Beers came out cold, Alex was seamlessly attentive.  Never made us feel like she was trying too hard; know what I mean?  Anyway, we never felt like we waited too long for anything and she and her team managed our big group with the smoothness of a well tuned and oiled machine.

We did not order appetizers and got right down to business.  There were a lot of salads consumed tonight.  Go figure, eating with a group of cyclists.  I had the Ahi Tuna Salad.  It was big and I was full when I finished.   It was comprised of about 6 ounces of seared Ahi on top of a bed of baby greens, daikon sprouts, crushed cashews, colorful yellow and red pear tomatoes.  It was supposed to have a wasabi plum dressing, but what I got was more teriyaki based.  It was okay.  A little salty.  They poured the dressing for me.  Gratefully it was not a heavy pour. 

No one complained, plates were cleaned, and they brought out two desserts for the birthday boy...to share.  Deep Fried cheesecake and a chocolate lava cake.  They were both delicious. 

I wasn't blown away, but I'd come back to try some of the other items on the menu.  

It's clean and Alex was the Bomb."}
{"text":"Good pizza open 24/7. Great for a night owl like me who needs a margarita pizza at 2 AM. Still haven't had the beer here yet. Will reserve posting a full review until then but the pizza alone was warranting of a good partial review."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - always enjoyed myself. 

Went most recently with my husband and toddler to have lunch. It was a Monday a few months ago, the place was pretty empty as it was a little after what would have probably been the lunch rush time and it was on a weekday.  But that didn't stop the server from making it a wonderful visit. I wish I could remember her name to give her props, but needless to say, we were happily impressed with her service along with the food.

Server was knowledgeable about majority of the items. There was a question I had she wasn't sure about, but she answered honestly that she wasn't, went to the kitchen to find the correct answer and returned promptly. I'd rather have a server treat me with honesty than lie to hide the fact that they didn't know the right answer. Also proved that she had good relation with the BOH team and encouraged our guest perception that the whole establishment was working well together.

The beer was as it should be - cold, delicious and served in clean glassware (seems simple, right? but we all know that's not the case).

Food was perfectly done and served hot and fresh.

My toddler was - as always - a little pain, but our server coddled him flirting with her and paid extra attention. As a veterans of the food service industry, my husband and I were impressed at the attention given to us and the overall quality of the entire visit.

Highly recommend to families and to anyone who wants a great dining experience.

Thanks, Chicago!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice, atmosphere was awful. Smelled horrible inside like an abundance of cigarettes in the main restaurant area, not the bar. Couldn't really enjoy the food as a result and still smell the cigarettes on my clothes. Seats had holes and were very worn. Food was just okay. Sad it wasn't better. Won't be going back unless they remodel and get rid of the smell."}
{"text":"Place isn't too bad to stop and have a drink. It was kind of packed for a Thursday night. We saw a guy getting helped out by his friends. He was stone drunk, legs dangling. Have a feeling this happens more often than you think. 

It's basically a PTs with a slightly better draft list since it's a brewery. The beer isn't that great. It's not something you would purposely go out of your way for. They are slightly better than the normal bar options. The brown ale would be the way to go. 

I put some money on the machine to play and cashed out when the getting was good (up $10, big spender!). Bartender asked me to sit at a table to free up the machine to those who wanted to play. That's a normal thing in these bars to do that but it was nice as the bartender comped our drinks so that we would move. I thought that was a little nice touch."}
{"text":"Mike was our server, and he was extremely courteous and helpful.  Uptown Roasted Garlic Chicken and the Chicago style deep dish pizzas were good choices for this afternoon."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went one night, they had a great atmosphere. We had a choice to eat outside since it was so nice out. I myself tried their blueberry vanilla beer and I personally very much liked it."}
{"text":"On the Saturday afternoon of Memorial Day Weekend, my Dad and I decided to check out Chicago Brewing Company.  He loves beer and I love daytime drinking so our only requirements were somewhere that you could have/do both. We got the BEST seating outside, directly under the speakers that were playing the BEST 80's songs.  We had so much fun guessing artists and song titles while drinking in the shade. The beer flight there is a STEAL! You pretty much get to try every beer (I don't recall the exact number) and for a great price (I don't recall the price either, sorry!). They also have chilled Fireball just WAITING for you to shoot. 

The best part for me was complimenting our server on what a great job she was doing, only to find out that she's actually a busser! She said our original server got too overwhelmed with his other tables so she had to take over our table.  I was just in awe that someone with such little serving knowledge gave me one of the best dining experiences that I can recall.  I wish I could remember her name but CBC I hope you promoted her to be a server!!

I highly recommend the hot wings as well.  If you're gonna go big and get beer and Fireball -ya gotta get hot wings.  We tried their 'death sauce' or whatever they call it - basically the hottest of the hot. But being hot sauce connoisseurs it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. 

This was my first and only experience at CBC but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As far as pizza places go there's not much that sets this place apart from anywhere else. 

My friend and I stopped in here while on Fremont Street and the first thing I noticed was just how small the place is. Despite the size, however, we did have to wait a bit to get served, probably due to the fact that you seat yourself here. 

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which is served with marinara (mediocre) and garlic aioli (amazing - just the right amount of garlic flavor without being overwhelming). 

For the pizza, we skipped the Chicago style deep dish and went with a large thin crust meat lovers. Like I said before the pizza was average, not bad but not great either. 

The service seemed to get worse the longer we were there. While our food came out in a reasonable amount of time my friend had to ask for a refill and no one came by to see how anything was after we got our food. 

Overall it wasn't a terrible experience but it's not somewhere I'd make a special trip to."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a \"theme\" restaurant, but in my opinion the only thing that may appear theme-ish is the fact that they serve deep dish pizza, (which is quite tasty, by the way).

I do not like beer, but for those who do enjoy the frosty beverage, they have several local and on-site drafts on tap. My boyfriend really enjoys their summer ale at the moment.

They have a fairly extensive menu, which ranges from gourmet pizzas to pot roast to standard bar fare. The food is definitely good, but some items are a little on the expensive side. For example, a large chicken caesar salad will set you back $12 (it's decently portioned, but it's still chopped lettuce with some chicken). Conversely, the chicken parmigiana, which is absolutely delicious, is $12.99; but any average eater could easily get two meals out of it.

The staff is nice and fairly attentive, but sometimes the service is a little slow, depending on if you sit in the bar or not and the time of day.

I'd definitely recommend, but know you're probably going to throw down about $20 to get the full Chicago experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now and have developed many friendships over their delicious beer -best draft beer!

Oh and I do enjoy their clam chowder :)"}
{"text":"Super yummy! The chicken tenders are lightly breaded and very tender cuts of chicken breast. The deep dish pizza was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday palace. During Football season, I'll stray off with an Happy Hour menu; Wings and blue cheese dressing. In-house brewing. An \"All Nighter\" was my choice, of the house picks. Nice beer battered onion rings. With the name \"Chicago,\" You have to try there pizza; It just seem logical. A local 24Hour joint"}
{"text":"I have to talk about the beer I fell in love with initially: the stout of order. Now if your a Guinness lover, like me, this little number will have the similar joy that it brings but with a bigger coffee kick that lingers at the end. Oh buddy!
As for food, my boyfriend and I got a garlic, mushroom and spinach deep dish pizza that included roasted tomatoes which pulled the entire pizza together. I would love to high five to creater of the amazing sauce and crust that went into this pizza. Its as if the pizza Gods came and just delivered this piece of heaven to my neighborhood brewery. And its crazy to think that I've been living in this area for years and never thought to stop in. Count me in as a regular!"}
{"text":"Extremely limited menu after 11pm. Service wasn't that great either the waiter kept walking away before even listening to my friend's orders for beer or food. The Prosecco was from upstairs and not chilled but I guess the one cool thing was after the two glasses I had they gave me the rest of the bottle for free. Also this isn't their fault but the customers were extremely loud and almost belligerent in fact one guy screamed so loud and acted like he was going to throw something on the ground after losing a bet or something not sure but it scared the crap out of me. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The second floor is a great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"I love the way this place looks from the outside.  The inside is also very nice and comfortable.

The beer here is worth stopping in to try.  I enjoy their Amber ale, very good taste.  I've eating here a few times over the years and the menu changed recently, probably for the best.  One time I got the exotic animal meat sliders like rattlesnake, alligator and deer.  Not bad, but no need to try it again.  The last time I got the Cajan chicken sliders and they are an above average slider.

This is a good place to stop for a beer and some sliders.  Check it out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We tend to eat at night time as we live down here at downtown Las Vegas and we gamble a lot! We usually get out from the house around 10/10:30 so when it comes to food choices there aren't a lot of restaurant open; so we are just glad to some restaurants down here that are open 24/7. 

So this Chicago brewing is pretty small place. And they mostly have bar food! Service is pretty great! But it's pretty loud in here due to the place that is very confined and all the tables are pretty close together. 

We sat on the bar and played video poker, didn't really win anything but we also didn't get any comp for the drinks either. So maybe because it's a restaurant anyway.. so.. we ordered some mozzarella cheese, calamari, cowboys balls (cream cheese and corn fritters) and wings (that they claimed is never frozen) well.. they all taste like a frozen food to me! We ate 2chicken wings because they really are not that good! The calamari was ok; it was a bit tough! And mozzarella cheese were also pretty tough! But those cowboys balls are the bomb!!! Just one thing we liked! 

Service is pretty on point! He was very attentive to our needs, super polite and friendly! 

So after all; for the service alone! And the convenience of it opening late yes we will go back! But based on food; ehh probably not! :) although we didn't try their pizza though! So maybe next time and I'll write an updated review if we did!"}
{"text":"YEAHHHH ANDREA B.!!!  We need to hang out soon!

The bestie and I came here twice.  In three days.  Sure it helped that we were staying at the Four Queens, but whatever.  The service, food, and beer were top notch, and we'll definitely be back!

Things seem aloof at first, with the self-seating and whatnot, but once you grab someone's attention, they're yours forever...  teehee.  An IPA, a root beer, garlic knots, buffalo wings (hot), and Brew-BQ pizza later, and we were in heaven.  Weeeell...  at least in heaven's foyer.  Even though we fell in love with the magical knots (GET THEM...  EVERYONE RECOMMENDING THIS IS SPOT ON), tang and heat of the wings (I'm no math teacher* or anything, but I'm preeetty sure they dumped on more than just 10 menu-stated wings on there), and the beverages (ROOT BEER = PERFECTION -- the IPA is pretty hoppy and leaves you a decent finish), we were kind of medium about the pizza.  The crust was super, and the pie itself was fresh outta the oven, but the toppings were somewhat lackluster.  Not enough bbq sauce, no seasoning on the chicken, etc.

Round 2!

Minus garlic knots (we still had leftovers in the room; might I add that they make PERFECT bedtime snacks at 7am when you return from EDC?), replace pizza with the Uptown Chicken Garlic Whatever (sorry, that's not the actual name).  And...  DIVINE INTERVENTION INDEED.  Perfectly grilled chicken, strips of sundried tomatoes, a yummy garlic presence, just the right touch of basil, all on that deliciously crispy crust.  LOVED IT!

The fifth star belongs to Bryan (? -- I think that's his name), who saved my slight coughing fit with a glass of water and a giggle, and to that fake \"open nighttime sky\" you can see above the smoking side of the joint.  Awesooooome.  See you again soon Chicago Brewing!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat/drink/watch sports. Happy hour from 3-6 is also worth taking advantage of.
Favorite beer is the chocolate stout"}
{"text":"We ran here for lunch and I honestly expected it to be busier. There were only 5 tables occupied, maybe people like to wait until later in the day to get their craft brew on. When you walk in you will be slapped in the face by hoppy goodness (not a typo, the place smells like hops and barley).

One server covering the whole place, she did a nice job of checking all the tables. One had a large group at it that required extra attention. 

We ordered burgers, but ended up getting some wings too. The burgers are all build your own, it would be nice to see them add a couple signature burgers to the menu. We don't lack creativity though, so we came up with some flavor combos. I went with a Mushroom Swiss. It was cooked well enough. I think I'll ask for a Medium Rare next time to juice it up a little. You have your choice of steak fries or regular. Both are good. 

The wings were a little let down. The sauce was good, but the flavor didn't penetrate the skin, so the meat inside tasted bland. Don't worry, the hot sauce packs a little punch.

I'll go back, next time to try one of the great looking pizzas I saw heading out to the other tables."}
{"text":"So the bartender upstairs is amazing, Jason is great always social always on top of his game! Couldn't have anyone here better because he does offer the beer selection on top of the alcohol selection. Very friendly & knows his regulars"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!!  Food is great,  so is the beer, and amazing root beer!  Bob has been our waiter several times and he is awesome. We would highly recommend this for a nice evening."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded to 4 for very good service

Dropped by here to use some comp dollars and try some food / beer.  I was curious what it would be like after the mixed reviews.

Sat in the non-bar room after noticing someone smoking in the main room...it's amazing to me that smoking is still allowed in restaurants here in Vegas?  Blah.

There are TVs all around so it's a nice place to catch the game :)

Anyways we tried a small thin crust with pepperoni and jalapeno and the garlic knots and 2 hefeweisen's and the bill was around $26 without tip.  The garlic knots were a lot of food for $5.  The pizza is on the smaller side but decent.  The beers were average, nothing spectacular but not bad.

Mike our server from Maryland was very nice and quick to help us out.  When we sat down someone actually came out from the kitchen right away and asked if we wanted menus.  Maybe the service is bad when it's more busy but the other night it was great.

I'll come back here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza--- Absolutely! Oh and the crust is Vegan, and the veggies aren't soaked in butter or anything crazy so if you're vegan you can order a pizza w/out cheese and tons of veggies, and let me tell you, it's delicious.

Beer- Pretty damn good!

Service- Pretty awful. We waited foreverrrrr for our server, I'll give it to her that she was extremely nice about me be vegan (I feel like a pain in the ass, all the time) but there were three of us that would eye her while she was wandering around helping other people and she wouldn't even stop over to ask if we wanted something. It also took a long time to get our check. 

Over all it's definitely a good place to eat! watch out if you need to use the bathroom a lot, because there isn't one in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very cool sports bar serving good tap beer.  The giant beers were $5 and we had a 2 for 1 coupon from the Four Queens Hotel where the Chicago Brewing Co. resides.  Great  brews.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is cool, down stairs bar and restaurant, bar upstairs with a balcony, and plenty of beers and food to choose from. The staff are friendly and polite."}
{"text":"All I can say is that the deep dish pizza here is fantastic!  

Super good garlic knots too.  Service is good.  It's located inside the Four Queens.  If you can't find it just ask one of the staff.  I was hungry and after I ate, I wasn't.  That is all."}
{"text":"After two full days at bbq competition in the freezing cold weather, we just wanted a nice cozy place to rest our feet and we found it here.  Nestled in the back of The Four Queens, where we were staying, we found beer and pizza...what a great combination.  And this wasn't just any pizza, this was Chicago-style thin crust, my favorite! The pizza and garlic knots were both delicious! I also ordered a sampler flight of beer, which came with eight different beers and a sample of their root beer as well.  I was definitely impressed as was the rest of my party.  I'll definitely return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I called in an order and it included a buffalo wrap and garlic knots. I asked to have the buffalo wrap mild but when I got home and had the first bite, my mouth was on fire! I think they accidentally put it as HOT instead of mild. What a terrible mistake. It was too spicy, I couldn't even eat more than two bites. I ended up throwing it away. There goes $10. 

I also ordered the garlic knots. Now those were pretty good. However, the menu on yelp said it would be $5 but when I got the bill, it was $8. I know $3 isn't much of a difference but the prices should be listed correctly! There goes $20 down the drain. I was not impressed. 

The service wasn't good but it wasn't bad. Then again, what should I expect from a brewery/restaurant. I would like to come back to give this place another try but we'll see.. 

This review was based on my \"to-go order experience.\""}
{"text":"The Margherita pizza was fantastic,  surf and turf was  awesome , clam chowder was so flavorful. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Josh S. told me about this local Vegas place that has magical blueberry vanilla wheat beer. It sounds grosse but is in fact beautifully brewed, very smooth and tasty! This brew is now one of my top favorite beers of all time. Truly stellar!

The food is also very well prepared. I only eat meat sparingly and could not pass up the Trio of Filet Mignon Sliders appetizer (three broilded tenderloin filets topped w/ sautéed mushrooms & onions). The light and fluffy bread melted in my mouth along with the perfectly cooked Filet Mignon meat.

To save room for the beer, I chomped on a light Asian Ahi Salad (rare seared Ahi Tuna, mixed greens, toasted cashews, daikon sprouts, fresh tomatoes, w/ a Wasabi PlumVinaigrette).The Ahi Tuna was perfect and the dressing was good enough to bath in! So yummy! 

Sadly I only had enough room for the one beer but was eyeing the 50oz glass for my collection..next time. This place is a must for locals and visitors alike, regardless of its off-the-strip location. BTW, there is also a cool upstairs with games, additional bar, lounge, video poker, cigars/humidor and outdoor dining for cool nights."}
{"text":"Chicago brewing is awesome. I love the stout. Awesome price for a pitcher of any of their house brews. Cool cigar lounge upstairs. The staff is very friendly, professional, and attentive. The food is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome cheap brews. It's a great place to just hang out and get a beer or eat some of their great food."}
{"text":"Beers are great!! Food is outstanding.... from the salads (yes, salads) to the deep dish pizzas to sliders to the baked ziti that probably weighs 4 lbs, DELISH!! My boyfriend and I have been 5 times now and has become one of our favorite spots, and we're picky!!

Would have rated it a 5 star but due to the terrible service we receive EVERY TIME we are there, yes, EVERY TIME, I just can't rate it a full 5! Such a shame! Between the servers sitting in the back soda station complaining about anything and everything to the curt disposition the servers posses each time they need to refill water or to take your order is beyond me!! Even when I ordered my salad with no olives yet came out with olives I did not complain, the server quickly realized the mistake but without apologizing or even making eye contact takes my plate away and brings me a new one. This new one, clearly picked through for olives, STILL HAD OLIVES.... which I placed on the rim of my plate so she'd notice, oh, she noticed yet did not mention a word!! Folks, I'm not asking for a foot rub or someone to bring me food on a gold platter but is a smile or even an attempt at pretending to care about a guest that loves this bar/restaurant, that keeps returning such a large request?! 

I rate this place between food and beers a 5 star, service on the other had? A 1 star!!"}
{"text":"I've now had my return visit to CBC and it is definitely a 4 star for the food. We went with another deep dish pizza and also had chips and salsa as we had a friend with us. The veggies on the Lakeshore Veggie are cooked perfectly (we get it without mushrooms because I can't stomach the fungi). The crust is crunchy a buttery, the sauce tangy but not overpowering. The chips and salsa (plus beer cheese dip) were also good. I loved the chips and the salsa. The cheese beer dip was sweet. I don't know what that was about, I don't know what beer they used, but it just didn't taste right. I could have eaten more chips, but thank goodness the pizza came out just in time.
I also had a full mug of the Ramblin' Reck Red. It was quite delicious. I bit more carbonation than other reds I've had, but still a nice malty flavor. 
I would have considered a 5 star, but our service just wasn't good. It was dinner time and happy hour so CBC was hopping. Our server was working tables inside and outside. We kind of got the shaft. He was very apologetic, which was nice, but not fun. 
I am looking forward to my next time so I can have some more beer."}
{"text":"Great experience having dinner here! We were looking for affordable dinner downtown and craving pizza. I found this place on Yelp and thought we would check out Chicago Brewing. The restaurant is inside the a Four Queens casino and you need to walk up stairs to access the restaurant (I'm not sure if there is an elevator for those who need it.) The restaurant and bar area is small, maybe 15 tables maximum. We found a spot at one of the high top tables (there were only a handful of non-high tops) and were immediately greeted by a server who brought menus. We ordered the root beer, the Chicago deep dish pizza, which is a personal size pizza, garlic knots, and chicken tenders tossed in mild sauce. Everything was very good and the service was great!! We loved the pizza/marinara sauce!! The whole meal was under $30 for the 2 of us."}
{"text":"Perfect, quiet place to escape from Fremont and be able to talk to your friends. Appetizers and pizza were fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. Got ahi tuna salad, tuna was nearly frozen cold, tasted way too much like fish. Clearly not remotely fresh. French fries were stale as hell and cold. Never ever eating there again"}
{"text":"Bradley Cooper look-a-like \"CHRIS\" on 3rd floor lounge great hospitality, took care of us on our first visit! Cornelius is great host/server and our server \" Tamara\" was great to us recommending the chili for next time."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I'm dying to go back to Vegas just to eat here again! The pizza is so delicious! U must try it!!! Don't get fancy and  start adding all kinds of toppings just keep it simple cheese and pepperoni! U will not regret it (deep dish/Chicago style). The wings are so good and the prices are so reasonable I'd drive all the way from Cali just for dinner to eat here!!! Service was ok pizza takes long to come out so be prepared to wait! I love that we arrived in town so late but this little delicious slice of heaven (literally) was still open!"}
{"text":"good happy hour food pricing and service when you can get the bartender's attention. 
I'd go back.  
Beer good, prime rib sliders a bit overcooked, but aok with tobasco."}
{"text":"The pizza and microbrews were just fantastic, and this was a nice little excursion after walking the downtown Fremont section of Las Vegas. 

The pizza is the traditional Midwest thin crust, but you have options. You can also order the deep dish pizza pie. I ordered mine with cheese, sausage, mushrooms and onions. The pizza was so good and close to some of the best thin crust pizzas I have had while living in the Midwest.

The bartender went over the list of microbrews that they brew themselves. I had a couple of Hefeweizens, which is my beer of choice. Really good beer. Less tart and more of a banana flavor to it. 

Overall, I had a really good experience. If you're walking the Fremont section, and you are looking for a good ol' pizza, I would strongly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of chains/franchises, yet, While in vegas it was certainly difficult to escape them. This place was the best choice for our first evening in downtown vegas.

Good Beers, good sandwiches and pizza.  Our server was great too, very friendly.
Recommend the Reck's and the IPA.

If you're in downtown vegas, and would like to try something other than the buffet, check this place out, it is inside the Four Queens Hotel (which is not specified on Urban Spoon)."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. I normally don't write reviews but I feel like I need to in my case to showcase what kind of business they are running and the type of people they employ.  Their bartender Jojo held a fundraiser event here last February for a friend of both of ours who passed away. This event was held AFTER the funeral and all proceeds were intended to go towards a memorial tree or bench in this persons honor. It has been a year and still nothing has been done with the $2000 that was raised. Raffle tickets, bracelets and tshirts were sold and the bartenders tips were also suppose Ron be donated to this cause. There were also Ciroc drink specials as well. Jojo has been giving me and the family of the deceased the run around and empty promises which leaves me to believe he has kept and spent all the money that was raised by family and friends! The managers and owners are NOT holding this person accountable after all
The proof has be shown that this person is lying. So I encourage you all not to support this business!!! Taking advantage of someone's death is a new low!! Also it smells like sewer in the restaurant area  Please DO NOT support this business!!!!"}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company is Legend-ary!

The fresh brews are all tasty. The Amber being superior. 

Upstairs is a nice cigar-friendly lounge complete with second bar, leather chairs, plenty of seating, and patios for fresh air. I've spent a lot of time at this bar and really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the house beers at this place. Nice environment, real chill.  I recommend it for a chill night with some friends."}
{"text":"This very casual sportsbar/brewery is right off the Casino Way entrance to the 4 Queens on the Fremont St Experience thoroughfare. And, for an unassuming place in a dated casino in downtown LV, I gotta say I was impressed!

I will fully admit the pizza was an afterthought after I saw the Tower of Beer sampler they offered for $8.99! The 9 different beers were surprisingly good. 8 are their regular brews w/the other one being their house-made root beer, which is delicious!

They offer Chicago deep dish pizza, but I had a thin crust that was my own concoction and it was decent. I've had better and I've definitely had worse.

The other delicious surprise were the garlic knots. Nom! Even the marinara dipping sauce was good, and I am usually not a fan!

The service was good as well. Initially our waitress was a lil brusk, but she was competent and that is what matters. She did warm up in the end. The guy waiter was a hoot and was rocking a great t-shirt that said \"&!?$ Milk, Drink Beer!\"   

So come for the beer and stay for the food and enjoy the Fremont St experience."}
{"text":"Tried their beer sampler- it was very good! I tried their garlic knots and calamari, both are very good! I look forward to trying the rest of the menu!

However, these are my complaints: my friend ordered a grasshopper for me. Don't get me wrong- it was very delicious. However, when it came to the bill, it appeared charged as a Colorado Bulldog (those are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT drinks). Also, my friend asked me to suggest him s drink to order at the bar (I'm a bartender) and I suggested a Sombrero (milk and Kahlua, nothing special) the bartenders apparently were clueless on what it was, apparently googled it and still had no idea what it was or even nearly claimed it does not exist. But yet they have a button on the register for a Colorado Bulldog?! (basically a sombrero with a splash of cola)

Well, I really want to like this place. I'm giving it another try, just because the food was great."}
{"text":"When down at Fremont this is a must stop for us. Great food, great beer, wonderful service, & an overall fabulous atmosphere. We will be back again on our next visit. Stop by this venue & you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A cozy enclave on the 2nd floor of the Four Queens to openly enjoy your cigars and enjoy the Chicago Brewery beers on tap. There is a dining area to the left and a loungy area with bar tops to the right. Garlic knots, deep dish pizzas and other goodies are served on both sides.

Service is quick and food served hot. Bartenders even remember and acknowledge us. Comfortable place to relax and watch ESPN. Ask for tasters if you're unsure of their beer on tap selection. If you gamble and know what beer you like, order the large size. Buurp!"}
{"text":"You MUST try their deep dish pizza!!!!! It's truly the best! I go here every time I go to Vegas and it's never disappointing. It's pretty small inside and they don't have many booths. They sell their own beer and have cigars for sale as well. It does take a while for service once you seat yourself but overall worth the wait"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time because of the deal they have with \"the indi card\". 

Well tonight I went and asked the server prior to ordering if they still honored the card. 

Never heard back from her. 

When the bill was presented. No discount. The only reason I went is for the discount. Being a disabled Vet on a very tight budget. I am very selective when I go out. 

That being said. I do not think I will be patronizing this place any more because of this. 
It's not even the money $9. But the principle that no manager would come out and talk to me so I had to just leave cash and go. (For the entire amount)."}
{"text":"Good selection on the beer, especially when they're having the seasonal beer. Great atmosphere at second floor bar/lounge. Food selection here is pretty good too. Whoever likes spicy food you must try the Ghost Wings. Chicken wings with ghost Chilli pepper sauce, hottest pepper in the world. They should have a challenge here for eating those wings. Another signature item must try is their garlic knots.  Overall a fun place to hang out and enjoy their hand craft beers."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Super chill server. Great food and cheap!! Worth the stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick dinner on a late Sunday night. They have a midnight menu that starts at 11pm and happy hour that starts at 10pm. Their menu is limited to pizza, sandwhichs, typical bar food. We didn't order the pizza or beer because we just had it for lunch. I had the chili, my bf ordered the pastrami sandwhich which was just ok but I didnt like the bread it came on. He also had a side of mac and cheese that looked like it was kraft from the box. I could of made that for 25cents. The only cool thing I thought they had was chicken wings or tenders with ghostpeppers. It is supposedly the hottest pepper on the planet? Its pretty expensive too, $14 for 4 tenders or 6 wings. Since no one in our group wanted to eat it for a challenge we ordered the tenders and each took one. I think we all had about 1 bite and immediately needed a jug of water and glasses of milk. It was SPICY!!

If you ever have friends to want to take a challenge, Chicago's ghostpepper chicken wings are the place to go for it."}
{"text":"Do groupons work, here is proof. They are all the way accross town for us but worth the drive. I had the patty melt which comes on rye. Cooked to order, juicy and tasty. The had a board full of beers (i didnt think to ask about a sampler.) Had a Weizenheimer with lemon. Very good. Would also reccomend the homemade potato chips, the pizza and the handcraft root beer. Service very good. Found out they have great happy hour specials. $2.5 for a 22oz, $11 for a pizza, $6 for a pitcher, yeah...i'm there."}
{"text":"I can say our server was great.   Very attentive.   And the food merits 3 stars at minimum.  We had the think Chicago style and it was very tasty.  What took away was the cleanliness of bathroom.   Before dinner washed hands and it was just gross.   1 hour later, as we were leaving, went in to see if someone had bothered to clean and the answer is no.   Made me a bit concerned about the overall cleanliness of the establishment."}
{"text":"Late night burger & wings - burger rocked but the fries & wings lost their crispness since the chef forgot to pop a few holes in the styrofoam but it's ok - next day I broiled em & yum yum gimme some!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last Friday.  The most notable item consumed was definitely the spinach and artichoke dip!  ($10) probably the best I've had in Vegas.  Delicious thick white cheese and not a ton of pesky vegetable spinach.  Comes with baisc tortilla chips.  Nice portion!  Also had a decent buffalo chicken wrap served spicy style...not too spicy...came with thin fries. ($10)  Wanted to try the mango wheat but resisted.  Good job by Jonny our waiter keeping the iced tea flowing."}
{"text":"Great pizza and beers, when you in down town Vegas this is a must, great people and atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was not our first visit, but it pretty much sums up the others.  Last time we sat at the bar, but this time in the dining room.  It's pretty, all brick, high ceilings, nice circular booths and also tables.  

The service was excellent.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to learn that it was not overpriced.  My husband had the brown ale, and he reports that it's very good.

Our server had to return numerous times, because it takes me forever to figure out what I want to eat, but he never displayed any impatience.  I finally decided on a burger with avocado, and my husband orderd the Chicken Piccata special ($10 - such a deal!), and the Split Pea Soup special.

He liked his chicken a lot.  It was a good-sized portion of chicken, and came with green beans and fresh red-skinned mashed.  The soup was good, too - a large-sized bowl with thick pea soup.  I tasted it and, as usual, it was way too salty for my taste, but he doesn't care about that.

My burger arrived on a huge bun, with the avocado, lettuce and tomato.  The tomato was a slice of completely white tomato CORE.  I asked the waitress who delivered it to bring me a slice of real tomato, and she promptly delivered a whole plate of red, sliced tomato.

The burger was big, and is supposed to be Angus, but it was dry, somewhat overcooked, and definitely not flavorful.  Instead of fries, I ordered a side salad.  The waiter had said I could substitute the salad for the fries, but he didn't say there'd be a $3 extra charge.  I didn't make a fuss when we got the bill because a) we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate, and b) the salad was absolutely huge, a composed salad of greens, iceberg, carrots, chickpeas, tomato, cucumber, olives, and croutons.  I gave half of it to my husband and still had enough to fill me up before the burger arrived.

I like this place:  great atmosphere, great service, and if the food were a tad better, I'd ramp up my rating.  But we'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my Co workers for Ken M's UYE Pizza, Peppers, and Pints event. Unfortunately I didn't see anyone from Yelp so we sat in the bar area because my co workers didn't want to sit around children. 

I really wanted to order some of their Sleeners but my co workers and I are participating in a weight loss challenge. That means we shared two salads. We ordered the Greek Salad and the Buffalo Mozzarella Salad. I mostly ate the Buffalo salad. It had mixed greens, Roma Tomatoes, sliced Buffalo Mozzarella, and we had the Balsamic dressing on the side. The croutons were two small slices of  toasted French bread. Everyone was being good and didn't really want to eat them except for me. I mainly had veggies all day and needed some substance! The two salads can easily be shared between three people with enough to take home. It also makes you full fast!"}
{"text":"Had the Quesadilla and it was ok.
I actually enjoyed their beer sampler the best. 
Their root beer is a must try :-)"}
{"text":"Loved: The garlic chicken & spinach artichoke dip.
Hated: The chips that came with spinach artichoke dip were soggy and stale.
The service was lack luster."}
{"text":"I went here to watch the Bears game and they are losing the game.  Had a bit of fun time last night dragged myself here. Alex, the waitress was like a cute little sister she sat down with me and helped me pick the menu. 

The hostess was very friendly and put me in a booth to watch the game. I ordered the Reuben. I must say all the staff seems genuinely friendly relaxed and it was refreshing in a NON smoking  environment in the dining room downstairs. The Reuben was stacked high & freshly sliced which came with cross cut sweet potato fries. Very good!

The only issue I would like to hear the game here but perhaps in the bar the  game audio is on.  The dining room had Christmas carols playing  in the background."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has a lot of potential that they are not living up to.The building and layout is awesome. The decor needs to be revamped. Oh, FYI... lose the 10+ year old best beer banners from the early 2000's. The furniture seemed old and when we were sat the table was disgusting. Not acceptable  being there was only two other couples in the whole restaurant. 

The food was mediocre/gross. The buffalo wings were slimy and luke warm, the garlic knots were hard and barely palatable. I liked the Reuben sandwich although it was really greasy and my girlfriend liked the salad. 

I don't know maybe i came on a off day, but i wasn't pleased. I may try this place 1 more time being its really close to my house."}
{"text":"They are right across my house, they have nice beer, and  good prices. So definitely in my favorite beer place.

I used to be a Gordon Biersh fan, but after I discovered this place, it's my go to place for beer."}
{"text":"We were there last nite and will never go back the food is the worse than words can say the bartender was rude extremely dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I really liked the beer sampler, 9 samples for $10 is a great deal! They even included a non alcoholic root beer which is one of the best I've ever tasted! 
I ordered the corn fritters and potato wedges which were both very good. My friends had a chicken avocado sandwich and a deep dish pizza. The bread on the sandwich were kinda hard to eat but once the 3rd piece of bread from the club was taken out it was better. The pizza tasted good but just wasn't as deep as you would find in Chicago."}
{"text":"This place is what makes me love living in Las Vegas. Chicago's has a large menu so take your time when choosing. 

The buffalo wings are amazing with a slight vinegar twang and not too hot. The deep dish pizza is completely customizable, I recommend layering your pizza CHEESE FIRST, sauce, pepperoni, extra cheese, and extra sauce. Pot roast, when it is available, is probably the closest to homemade you can get. Lastly, I recommend the in-house brewed root beer: it has a sweet, vanilla, molasses taste. Simply awesomeness.

Chicago's is open 24/7 and the menu differs constantly so make sure you familiarize yourself. BUT the wings are available all the time, FTW.

The service is always friendly, knowledgeable about their brews, and (forgive me for saying) very easy on the eyes.

The beer review section: I suggest everyone to try the sampler then pick their favorite. The Old Town Ale and Hawaiian Honey are personal favorites. All the beers a distinctly different taste. I do usually prefer a dark ale (Guinness drinker) but Hawaiian Honey is the first light ale I've enjoyed in the at least 7 years.

I will definitely suggest this to EVERYONE that visits Las Vegas. A little trip off of the strip will definitely do you good."}
{"text":"Good food,  ok staff, nice customers, this place has a regular customer base that feels like a 'Cheers\" type bar. They have a good wine selection, which is rare for a gaming bar. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Tabbi was our server and she was very efficient with our order and our drinks. She stopped by our table at least three times to ask us if we needed anything. The food was great too! We came during happy hour so the drinks were cheap. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Just a spur of the moment choice to stop by for a meal. It was around 3p, a late lunch. There was hardly any customers in the dining room two other tables besides ours, so service was impeccable! 

Vinnie was our server, he was great! Always checked on us, made sure we were happy with our meal and refilled our drinks when needed. The service was good but then again there were only 3 tables of 4 tops or less so that may have been the reason.

As far as quality of food, it was average. Nothing out of the ordinary and that's one reason for 3-stars. Their menu doesn't excite me, it's nothing that would ever lure me back or have me craving something from here. I do get it's a more pub type menu but there's nothing here that would have me thinking \"oh I should come back for *insert savory dish*\". I ordered the buttermilk battered chicken breast with steak fries and a side of buffalo sauce. The chicken was crispy and well breaded but it wasn't a meal that had me wanting more. The steak fries weren't cooked thoroughly, some pieces were cooked well other pieces were hard and not fries through. 

Also the interior design wasn't enticing or presentable. A remodel or renovation is needed. Their menu needs work, maybe revitalize it, the menus we received were falling apart and not presentable. I wasn't impressed by the interior design, it seemed a little outdated and worn down. This was another factor to my 3-Star rating. Customers want to feel like they're walking into a well-maintained design."}
{"text":"Best food downtown--by a landslide!

I came here twice while I was only in Vegas for three days!

Why?   Really good service and VERY good, fresh food.

The first time I was here, we had pizza.   The garlic knots are a must try, so a table of two could easily split an order of knots and a personal pizza and get plenty full.    SO good, I felt badly for not being able to finish my pizza!

Then next morning I went there for brunch and had a club sandwich and fries with a bloody mary--hair of the dog.    (I hear great things about the beer, but just never got a chance to try it.  Next time.)     The sandwich was fresh and warm and the fries had kind of a batter on them that was just sooo addicting. 
The bloody mary was spicier than average.  I was proud of them for not being afraid to lay the hotness on thick.   Impressive.    Hangover cured.

It's a place I couldn't get sick of, with something for everyone on the menu!"}
{"text":"Based on the beer alone, I'd give Chicago Brewing Company 5 stars.

The selection of beers is great and the prices during happy hour are awesome! Definitely try out their beer tasting sampler if you're curious about the selection of beers they have.

The atmosphere is really nice and fun to hang out in. I dig the brick walls and views of the brewery. The servers are friendly and make sure that you're doing well regularly.

Although the food is a bit overpriced, the portions are huge and everything I've tried has been good. The chili fries are perfect to share among friends, although I wasn't stoked with the beer cheese sauce they make. The burgers and sandwiches have not disappointed, and I really enjoyed the homemade ranch chips.

For a couple beers this is place is perfect, the food is consistently good but not amazing. However, the quick service and chill vibe will bring me back."}
{"text":"This place offers a smoking and a non smoking side. The menu has a some Chicago favorites but not as many as you would think from the name. The beers are good and what you expect from brewery's today. Nothing I would go out of my way for, but good while you are there."}
{"text":"Looking around town for a place to watch the cubs game today. I came across this place thinking they would have the first game of the year on playing against their biggest rival. They had it on a few screens but music was playing over the speakers instead of the game. 

That was really the only big disappointment I had coming here instead of going to Brando's sports bar. 

However I will say the beer is great and had a nice variety to choose from. Along with their happy hour special I would come back again. But if the Cubs are playing then I wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"Tonight I am having the Buffalo Mozzerella Salad for appetizer and BBQ Chicken Pizza for my main entre.

The salad was not bad.  I could have used more mozzarella and tomato.  Balsamic vinagarett was a reduction, I think.  Whatever it was, it was very good.  I shared it with my dinner mate.

The BBQ Pizza is amazing.  I like my BBQ sause sweet and the sause fitsthw bill. Everything is fresh and made to order.  The only hint I ammnot understaning is why thy pit corn on it.  I ordered it without the corn as I could not imagine it with corn.  The deep dish crust is amazing.  It is doughy and chewy and tastes great just like I like it.

Im conclusion, it was a great night with great food and great company.  You should have a good time.

Ps, they have beer to."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four solid stars. My friend and I ate here during happy hour after seeing a movie at Red Rock. We stuck with the HH menu - some Garlic Knots, Chicken Tenders, and of course, their draught beer. The knots were delicious and definitely a HH crowd pleaser. The chicken was pretty good; they were tender fingers, but even though we ordered them hot, I could almost detect no spiciness.

To wash down the food, I had a Blonde Ale, while my friend started with their Hardway IPA and then switched to the Blonde Ale. I found the Blonde Ale to be quite tasty. At $2.50 for 22oz, it's definitely a steal. I tried a sample of the IPA and it tasted like a solid IPA! I wasn't in the mood for something that hoppy, but I can see myself ordering it next time. I also had a sample of their blueberry and vanilla wheat. I'm glad I did the sample first because it wasn't something of which I'd want a whole glass. It reminded me of another beer I've tried in the past that tastes like Fruity Pebbles!

What I truly appreciated about our visit today was the service that John provided us. It was just the little things he did to make sure we were happy. After all, it was happy hour. For example, when my friend ordered the IPA, he warned that it might be getting towards the bottom of the barrel, so he brought out a sample first. He also suggested that I get a sample of the blueberry and vanilla wheat first because other people have found it to be too strong in its fruitiness. I was actually going to ask for a sample, but he suggested it ahead of me. (And I'm really glad because I ended up not ordering it). He was also mindful of the fact that we were there for happy hour. He offered and came through by warning us when happy hour was almost over.

I can't speak for their entire menu, but this place is certainly on my list of good happy hours. Oh wait, I need to update my list! It's a little out of my way, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area, especially since I've now decided to see all my films at Red Rock."}
{"text":"Amazing beer,  the best calamari we've ever had and the sliders were awesome.  Second time coming to this place and we'll be back again!  Best part of our trip!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy drinking a nice beer as much as I do, then you have to come to Chicago. They brewed their own beer so you will always find something different. If you like girly/ sweet beers, then you must to try the strawberry wheat. Although this is a seasoning beer, they always have something fruity in their menu.  However, if you are embarrassed to drink a fruity beer then the hefeweisen is always a good option. The best part about Chicago is not their beer selection, but their PRICES!! If  You go during happy hour,( I believe is from 4pm to 7pm ) you can get a entire pitcher for only $5.00 bucks!! Really... you cannot bet that price. Their food is good, their ambiance is awesome and their staff is amazing.."}
{"text":"We had the chicken BBQ pizza.  It wasn't bad, just not awe-inspiring.  We liked the ale, though."}
{"text":"Prime rib sliders, awesome.  Great spicy chicken fingers. Beer was ok, but not quite cold enough.  Nice bartender but a second bartender was needed. And you can play video poker while you drink."}
{"text":"I come here with my hubby every year for fb play-offs same spot, same bartender, same delicious bbq pizza.  The smoke that accumulates can be a concern for you sensitive folk. The blueberry vanilla hefenweizen goes down smooth and the homemade root beer is yummy! The stout, red & IPA brews are spot on. If sports are on come early and grab a spot, great location to just chill and watch the game. I've been here 5 years in a row and I love Kimmy's blunt attitude.  If you're picky she'll walk right past ya. Keep it simple and she'll treat ya right! Go Chargers!"}
{"text":"Price for 1 cup of milk: $1

Price for ghost chili pepper wings: $15

Price of seeing a big guy being brought to his knees, getting into a fetal position on the floor, and crying like a baby after one bite of the ghost chili pepper wings and then writing about it on Yelp even though it didn't really happen so people will vote this review as funny.: Priceless!

For everything else you have Yelp.

@ Chips + Salsa / Beer Cheese - The salsa was just okay. The beer cheese just really didn't work. It just drowned a good portion of the cheese, minus all the fat that goes along with the cheese. You might as well pour oil into some beer and dip it in that. Thats essentially what you're getting.

@ Calamari - This was one of the saving grace of the night. Very delicious and crispy. The scores would be a lot different if this was the only dish I was rating, but it isn't.

@ Filet Mignon Sliders - Absolutely disastrous. I asked for medium rare, one of the 3 sliders was overcooked. The taste department was so dry, flavorless, and uninspired. The onions and mushrooms did nothing for this dish. I had to add barbecue sauce to a filet to make it not suck! When you have to do that, that just tells you how bad this dish is. The bread looks like it just came from a 20-pack at Costco . Not even warmed up or anything special done to it. Slider Truck is where its at for sliders. 

@ Olive Deep Dish Pizza - This just wasn't that good. Deep dish is suppose to be packed full of flavors. This was like eating bread dipped in ketchup and olives, flavorless and boring. 

@ BBQ Chicken Pizza - Some redemption. This did carry some good flavors and was good. I've had better BBQ Chicken Pizza before, but this  at least saved this place from getting a 1 star. 

@ Ghost Chili Tenders - Ghost chills is the hottest peppers in the world, period. I didn't try it because I'm really sensitive to any kind of spicy food. Our group did try it and it wasn't that bad for many. The worst effect is some numbness that lasted 10 minutes. But with a little milk and time, everyone was okay. Not like the oh em gee I can't open my mouth or eyes.

The reason for coming to this place was solely for our group to try the ghost chili. The menu is dull and uninspiring, its your typical bar food, and not even that good. 

Our waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive and personal. Nothing more you can ask from a waitress. However, food did come out kind of slow taking around 35 minutes for our food to come out. 

This place does take Restauraunt.com certificates, which could make a group meal cheaper. Double check to make sure the Happy Hour Deals aren't cheaper.

I wouldn't come here for the food again. If someone wanted to try the ghost chili, this would be the place to go. A great staff can only make bad food go so far."}
{"text":"Such good specials pretty solid food would recommend for that happy hour. Not so much out of happy hour, but hey we all got to survive"}
{"text":"It is located in the 4 Queens Casino and Hotel

It's a sports bar with beer, tv's and has fantastic appetizers.
They have the tastiest barbeque chicken tenders, awesome filet mignion sliders, and great chicken wings.  We enjoyed the tenders so much that we went back the next day and had 2 orders of them.  All the appetizers are 10.00 and under.

We never tried any salads or sandwiches.  They have friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"If you want to get off the over priced Las Vegas strip go to the Chicago Brewing Company.  This is where to locals go for a great locally brewed beer without the overpriced Strip pricing.  Walk into the brewpub, bear left and proceed up the steps to belly up the small bar where the bartender (Jason?) will actually introduce himself and will try to remember your name for the next visit. (Some kind of word memorizing gig he does.)  Had some pizza which was OK.  The upstairs got crowed after 9:30PM."}
{"text":"Such a great experience !! I do feel bad that I was the servers last customer. Johnny was great regardless , didn't rush us or anything . VERY KNOWLEDGABLE with  the drink choices and food . I was being a pain in the butt , and indecisive, but he helped me out . I tried the cheesesteak and my BF tried the burger , both delicious . Also the brews they had were very good . I will definitely come back again to check out their pizzas !"}
{"text":"Oh my Damn. This place rocks. Wings to die for. Pizza is hand made and probably some of the best I've  had in Vegas along with their root beer. Found a new favorite will be back. Got to witness some of their other food items coming out of the kitchen and they all looked super tempting."}
{"text":"I've only come to Chicago Brewing Company twice, and both times were because of their awesome happy hour.  Happy Hour goes from 5:00pm-7:00pm and 10:00pm-12:00am daily.  You can get a pitcher of beer for $6.00; you can get pints and so forth with happy hour prices, but $6.00 pitchers have won my heart.  My two favorite brews at the moment are the All Nighter and the Weisenheimer.  Also notable are their chicken tenders on the happy hour menu, which is $6.00 and includes around 8-10 pieces of chicken.  Sauce options are mild, medium, hot, BBQ and I think maybe one more option; chicken is served with ranch and a celery/coleslaw hybrid kind of salad that I'm not too crazy about.  I'd rather have plain celery sticks.

I would say that if I'm ever in the area during happy hour, I would recommend going to this bar.  But that would be a lie, since this past Friday my friends and I were on Fremont Street and I STILL recommended this place for happy hour.  I'd like to try more food from the place before I give a full 5 stars, so stay tuned for an updated review in the future."}
{"text":"The beer sampler was great, the food was good, and the service was awesome! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and just chill. Ambiance is good, music is ok, not too loud so you can still have nice conversation with friends. They serve good food and good drinks. Servers are really nice and orders come out fast. Would love to come back! =)"}
{"text":"Best food I had in downtown! Most places who claim to have deep-dish Chicago pizza outside of the city usually fail, but this place has every right to make that claim. 5 of us ordered garlic knots (based on reviews!) and a personal pizza. The knots were perfectly greasy, buttery, and addicting. Us 3 ladies accidentally finished off the pizza while we chatted over Blue Moons and the guys gambled, so we had to order them another one. It was pretty close to what I remember from visiting Chicago, a deep dish with a firm, crispy crust and oozing with cheesy greatness. Very highly recommended if you're near Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Oh Chicago Brewing Company, why did you kill your happy hour? CBC easily had the best happy hour in town but that recently changed when they got rid of their late night happy hour and shifted their regular happy hours to 3:00pm to 6:00pm. Aside from the terrible hour shift the happy hour still does provide some delicious beer on the cheap. Six Dollar pitchers by itself would be a pretty good deal but the quality of the beer brewed at Chicago brewery puts this happy hour over the top. Their Old Town Brown being my favorite, they offer a variety of beer to match just about any taste.

On the food end of things, I can't say I'm too experienced. I've usually stuck with the run of the mill bar food. The chicken fingers are easily one of my favorite in town. They're very lightly battered, none of this extremely crispy business you get from other places. They're decently sized and the Brew-BQ flavor is delicious, and a major plus is that they are discounted during happy hour along with the drinks. I've also had an above average hamburger there, nothing spectacular but it's definitely satisfying.

Overall a great place to have some good bar food and good beer. My only complaint is that they need to bring back the late night happy hour and shift their current happy hour an hour back so that it ends at 7:00pm instead of 6:00pm. 6:00pm just seems too early for a happy hour but maybe I'm just spoiled because of the hours that the previous happy hour ran."}
{"text":"Great place to chill and relax after a long day. My man Brad always has my scotch poured and cigar box unlocked before I get up the stairs."}
{"text":"Great sliders and being from Utah I lived that we could get a flight of beers. We got home of them haha. All were very good quality but the seasonal ones were by far my favorite. Atmosphere is kind of dark and dreary but none the less the service is pretty good. If visiting Vegas definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"one of the worse experiences of my life, let's just say the GM knows nothing about customer service!!! never going here again, and definitely not recommending anyone here!!!!"}
{"text":"Another excellent place to find craft beer in Vegas along with some pretty good food.  With the recent addition of their Hardway IPA, they have gave me a reason to visit more often.

This location offers a nice variety of seating, dining area, bar, upper level lounge.  Good deal on beers during happy hour, off the beaten path, in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the service was great. The beer and food, however was terrible. To start the beer sampler was flat and only cool to warm. The garlic knots had little flavor, but weren't terrible. The garlic chicken pizza was horrible, it tasted like they threw canned tomatoes on a stale cracker with canned chicken. There was no garlic, and for that matter no good flavor to to this. I for one won't ever go back as there are dozens of better places to eat on Freemont."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in downtown Vegas! Chicago tucked away in the Four Queens was an amazing place. Our friends has suggested we have dinner and drinks there so we all did!

Boy we're we surprised! We had their sliders which were so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking of them. The meat was flavorful and super tender. The calamari was absolutely perfect, something you would get at a 5 star seafood restaurant for the 1/8 of the price. The mozzarella sticks and deep dish pizza were also extremely tasty as well. Their food not only absolutely delicious but super affordable.

They also have a great drink selection and a whole Bloody Mary menu!

Their service was exceptional! Our waiter and bartender was super fast and kept checking in on us and had great suggestions for drinks and food!

If you don't like smoke I'd come during the week because it's known for being a cigar lounge. But if you can get past that you're in for a real super affordable treat!"}
{"text":"To quote Samuel L. Jackson: \"that is a tasty burger!\" Good brews and burgers. We were helped by BILLY and he ROCKS! Very friendly, helped with food and beer recommendations. A nice slice of comfort."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on reviews. It was ok. Inside the Four Queens, it's a tiny place in the back. I had the Black Widow Stout and it was so-so. Served in a huge frosty mug apparently designed for over-indulging tourists. We ordered the deep dish pizza. It had potential, but the dough was undercooked and, well, doughy."}
{"text":"Since there have been several changes at Chicago Brewery, I felt it necessary to update my previous review.  It appears the restaurant may be under new management, as there is now an imposing man who \"helicopters\" the restaurant like a hawk, making diners uncomfortable.  The menu has been completely scrapped for items that we can find at any chain restaurant, meaning that our favorites are no longer available.  It's a shame that after 10 years of eating here, we'd actually walk out... but that's what it came down to last Saturday after witnessing the manager berate our waiter in full view over something that wasn't his fault.  Not worth going into detail, but our disappointment had absolutely nothing to do with any of the wait staff.  I hope the owner's recognize and resolve the issue."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and everything we've ordered has been fantastic.  My favorite is the filet mignon skewers with horseradish sauce along with an order of their crispy onion rings.  It fills me up for dinner and I have the other half for lunch the next day -- two full, top notch, meals for about $20.  That's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend! It was a Saturday night about 7pm, we walked in with a guest count of 20 people. The person who was going to make the reservation forgot too... I was amazed by how nice they were to us and got us right in even though it was a busy day!

It had been some time since I had been here, not to much seemed to have changed. Still good food and good beer! 

We ordered \"The All Nighter\" for the the ber and then orders an few finger food to eat. The wings were very good! Everyone in all was happy and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Beer is pretty decent. Garlic knots tasted like wonderbread. Pizza crust tasted like chewing on charcoal.  Come here for drinks, but not to eat."}
{"text":"Decent-Good craft beer (big selection) but their menu is so-so for me. I always end up noshing on their food after a couple drinks, but the menu is kind of pricy to go there just to eat. Cool environment, can get pretty busy but is often really low key."}
{"text":"stopped in to get a bite for lunch, had the cheesesteak which was 4 stars, but their rootbeer is just mind blowing delicious. FYI it comes slightly cold in a full glass with no ice. Gets room temp pretty quick, so if you want get a glass of ice too. Like a lot of reviews it took forever to get the bill paid, finally just walked to the bar and asked for a bill and paid. I would wait a long time just for the rootbeer."}
{"text":"Walked in an walked out. Way too Smokey, dark and dingey for me. Had their beer at a recent brew fest and it was good but not worth the stinky atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past decade.  I'm thinking the menu and/or recipes have changed in the vast amount of time between my last visit and this recent one.  The decor is fun.  Brick with stained glass windows.  They offer two options for seating; tables and chairs or half circle booths.  The booths remind me of 'old Vegas' booths one would see in dining entertainment halls [in casinos] back when the brat pack were performing.  I'm thinking it could easily be transformed into a faux medieval tavern with taking out a few modern decor items and putting in some shields, swords and tapestries.  The smoking section is the bar and enclosed in behind glass walls and glass doors so one can truly be separate from the smokers.  I will say however that once in a while I got a faint smell of cigarette smoke; I'm guessing the servers exiting and entering the bar to serve food.  Anywhere you sit in the dining room you have full view of televisions (sports channels, bleh) and the kitchen.   We ordered garlic knots and pretzel bite appetizers.  The garlic knots are huge and delicious!  Friends ordered pizza and a Vienna beef sandwich.  I ordered the flat iron steak dinner.  Everything was delicious!  I cut a garlic knot in half and created a flat iron steak slider.  The handcrafted root beer is now my number one favorite root beer.  I didn't think my childhood RB favorite could ever be knocked down to second best, but their root beer succeeded.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The only thing I could see improving this restaurant is make it all no smoking so I can check out the bar area (but that's for my personal benefit).  Overall I would say this restaurant offers my favorite garlic knots and root beer hands down in Las Vegas.  I love the brick and stained glass decor.  Five stars as I'm going to overlook the few and far between faint smells of cigarette smoke in the dining room as the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"My little brother LOVES this place and I really like all of the options they give you but the food quality is okay. The environment is nice and cozy with their huge booths and can fit 6 people comfortably."}
{"text":"Just had the Mac & cheese with pulled pork and all I can say is that it does not compared to the filet mignon mac & cheese they use to have and now I'm sad. 3 stars just for the excellent service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I arrived a little before my friend who is a regular here and I found a spot at the bar. I am the type who just wants a beer that the bartender recommends. Thankfully I lucked out and was greeted with a smile by Alan!! He was super friendly without even realizing I was meeting up with one of his regulars . That leads me to believe this is a place to come enjoy a beer with good company!! I decided to try their seasonal blueberry vanilla beer (yes! I know that sounds gross) it honestly was delicious and I enjoyed not just one but two of them! They have a variety of different options and the glasses come chilled!!!!!! Check it out if you're in the area and looking for a yummy beer with fun bartenders and interesting regulars .. I can't speak on the food or any of that just beer and crowd"}
{"text":"This is a cool little brewery & restaurant.  I had a thin crust pizza and it was good.  The IPA I had was just average. The root beer they have on tap was very good. Decent customer service from a nice gentleman who was one of the only few servers working during a busy afternoon."}
{"text":"So happy we listened to our fellow Yelpers! Had the garlic knots and shared the Chicago deep dish between the 2 of us. The food was fantastic! 
They'll provide samples of their brews - I enjoyed the old town brown the most."}
{"text":"5/4/16 Service was decent, lots of choices of beers but I was set on trying the house drafts.  I ended up ordering the flight sampler of their 9 beers.  Nothing stood out as well as the Old Town Brown and the Hardway IPA which I'd rate both at a 4/5.

 Ordered garlic knots 3.5/5 the bread was fantastic the sauce 1/5 not so much.  Also had the chicken tenders the crispness of the breading was great. I think next time I would do the sauce on the side. Had the Hotiyaki, wasn't quite hot enough for my taste perhaps next I'll go hotter. 

 Overall an average experience.  I read great things of their pizza so next time I'll pass on the knots and have pizza and tenders. I'll give then a chance for redemption.


Came back 11/10/16: service was much better this time thanks to (Ronika) we ended up eating in the dining hall this time around since I had my son with. 

Ordered the Italian Beef with onion rings. I really liked that it is served dry and you can add the peppers and au jour as needed.  Great bread that held up and tasted great.  The onion rings were just OK. 4.25/5

My son had the Build your own burger-  so he opted for bacon and cheddar medium well..with fries.   He loved it.. I did try the fries they as well just OK. 4/5

Moving my initial review of 3 stars to 4 stars."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is in one word simply AMAZING.  

On 11/23/16 My family and I happened upon this location by accident as we were catching the Elvis show here and decided to give it a shot.

Right away the energy was great as the servers Michael and Tiffany were constantly in motion and handling the patrons within moments I had my Brown Ale in hand. 

I noticed the 9\" Chicago deep dish pizza for $9.99 and thought I'd give it a go.  The Pizza takes roughly 25 minutes to make and upon arriving I knew I had made a great choice.

The Pizza was hearty and cooked perfectly The cheese was holding the piece from coming out of the pie after cutting it.  The pepperoni, sausage and cheese made up the 1\" thickness of the pie. I was only able to finish 1/2 of it.  Lucky for me my family was there to help finish the remaining pieces along with the house Root Beer (the menu states voted Best of Las Vegas and after tasting I see why) definitely a must try.

The next night we came back 11/23/16 and brought even more guests as we went from a party of 4 to a party of 11.  Again the service was spot on but this time we tried several appetizers.  Everything from the garlic knots with marinara sauce, mozzarella sticks and table favorite chicken tenders satisfied our need to feed.

The chicken tenders were another high quality item the breading was seasoned perfectly and 5 large juicy pieces are sure to please.

So if you happen to be around Fremont Street and have a large appetite inside the 4 Queens casino you will find this great place. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Jesse in the bar started an argument with my elderly Veteran father and then kicked him and my entire family out of the restaurant for life. We have been eating dinner here every Friday for the last 7 years. Jesse is a hot head that should not be in customer service!!

Billy and Johnny have been very kind over the last 7 years so we will miss them but as long as Jesse is around we will express our dissatisfaction with Chicago Brewery! What a joke!"}
{"text":"They changed the menu and went once after that and we were disappointed since it wasn't the same and thought \"another restaurant goes corporate....\" after a time, some months and in the middle of the week we decided to return and see if it improved, it has! The burgers are once more great, good steak sandwich, best root beer and onion rings, they now have dessert which before they didn't have anything at all to speak of, and of course their beer is excellent. They did take some items off the menu, hope they still serve the Alfredo Pizza which we highly recommend.... We live close by so we were happy that we have this local's place available again."}
{"text":"I live very close to here and I know it's always a great place to go for some awesome bar food. Their chicken finger appetizer is amazing! The chicken finger are very meaty & the flavor is out of this world. My fiance had the Chili Burger, and it was hands down the best burger he has ever had, although he had to eat it with a fork. Haha he didn't mind once he took a bite. I had the all American Sliders & they were very very good. The flavor was better then my father's! & that's saying something. The service was incredible & very fast. But to put icing on the cake, the Bay Breeze I got was the best in town. Perfect ratio. I have to say, I'm in love with this place & you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Don't go here now if you were a fan of their old food. We went after not going for like 2 months. They completely changed the menu and now it tastes like bar food. They took off everything we used to eat and now their food is absolutely terrible. We were also treated terribly by the staff. We only saw our waitress once even though she had no problem spending time with the booth next to us for our whole visit. I will never ever go back here again because they obviously aren't catering to the dine in side as well anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they turned into just a bar. 

P.s. don't order their meatball sub unless you want the taste of fake cheese and a disgusting after taste to linger in your mouth."}
{"text":"CBC is pretty solid as brewery/restaurants go, but nothing special. Though, as far as micro breweries in Las Vegas, it's the best I've tried. The beer selection is decent but nothing I tried struck me as special. And isn't that the point of brewing your own beer? To be different than all the other guys? The food is typical brewery fare, comfort food, pizza, and a lot of fried stuff. 

The service is quick and friendly, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Been here a time or two before, and it's always nice. But this time we walked in sat down in the restaurant down stairs and immediately were approached by promoters and they gave out free items and free shots. Perfect because we were celebrating a birthday. It was happy hour from 4-7 and our server even extended the happy hour prices past happy our. Beyond nice. Food was delicious and perfect temperature. I'd be more than happy to visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Worse service , after a long time client because someone disrespected me because I'm gay.., she she a Prost Nig ! 
She on them , whatever are many places to spend my money , they can keep their girls asking for money there so trashy!"}

- An UPDATE 

THREE THINGS..I NOTICED IN LAST SUNDAY's Happy Hour:
1. Its Happy Hour STARTS at 4pm, NOT at 5pm as I had mistakenly thought before.

2. Beware:  There is \"NO Happy Hour SEATING at the Bar Counter downstairs\"!

3. Its HH is POPPING during game time with excited screaming fans (me included)!

YES, its attractive offers are still ALL there, i.e.:
- 22oz draft for $2.50; wine, 3; well drinks, 4; delicious HH bar dishes ($3-6) ); 
- Its reverse HH still goes between 10-midnight (I've got to give it a try after movies sometime)!

YELPY DETAILS YOU CAN IGNORE:
- After a long walk in Pueblo Park yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, I wisely decided to hydrate myself properly, well, deliciously! So, I went to CBC for the 22oz draft and thin crust pepperoni pizza($6 plus $1 extra for pepperoni)...over exciting NFL games! 
 - And...What a healthy HYDRATING experience it was, indeed! 

Now, here's something STRANGE about \"Seating at the BAR COUNTER\", though: 

- When I got in CBC around 4:30, I first went upstairs to take a look at their small loft bar. The bar counter itself was completely full; the lounge area still had a few bar tables. However, other than the lone barkeep, I did not see any server upstairs (perhaps, not until after 5pm). 

- As I was alone this time, I wanted to sit at the bar counter, so I went back to the downstairs lounge.   Here I was surprised to find out that the Happy Hour seating is \"restricted\" to the lounge area! In other words, one cannot have HH at the downstairs bar counter itself! 
- I think the reason for CBC's doing this is that they want the gaming machines available to playing customers. Perhaps, CBC knows that most their HH customers are NOT INTERESTED in playing video poker machines?
- There's no such restriction in the loft bar lounge, however. 

- Well, luckily, I got a comfy bar table along the wall, with a great viewing angle for several tv's! The food and drinks were great! My server was pleasant and attentive. And the atmosphere was just right for the occasion! The lounge area was almost completely full by 6pm, full of screaming fans for the 49ers and later for the \"home team\" Bears [who lost, if you care to know, to the Texans!]

BTW: - Oh yes, there's an elevator, too, hidden around the corner of the bar. So, CBC is handicapped friendly.

{"text":"Cool spot. Good service. Alan was a very good bartender. I highly recommend this bar after about 10:30. Nice crowd to boot"}
{"text":"Had the nitro stout and it was exceptional. But now I feel sick from the gd smoke, even though we sat in the no smoking dining area. If you can't stand cig smoke, cross this place off your list."}
{"text":"The BF and I sat on the patio to enjoy some beer. It was during their happy hour so we ordered off of the specials of select appetizers. Beers are $2 off, $1 off wells, half off the house wine. 

Their patio is pretty nice and in the afternoon part of it sits in the shadow of the building so it isn't too bad. There are TVs out there if you want to catch a game.

Order of teriyaki chicken tenders - these were crispy but the teriyaki was too salty for me since it was tossed with it. Probably would order them plain and just put a little. 

Mini cheese pizza - this was pretty alright flatbread type. I wouldn't really order those again. 

We also got some waffle sweet potato fries which were crispy and really good. 

Washed it down with their Black Star Stout which was really nice, nitro nice dark malt and dark chocolate notes.

Service was decent, but standard. 

I definitely love their beer and some of their food, but this visit was just A-OK."}
{"text":"The food and beer are fine, but the service, specifically in the bar, is awful. I have been on two separate occasions and sat in the bar, and each time had to wait upwards of 10 minutes to be greeted, let alone be given menus and have an order taken. On my last visit, the server took our menus away after we ordered appetizers and when we asked for them back so we could order dinner, she told us that she was off at 6. This all happened at 5:15, as if we were inconveniencing her to order food and spend money in the establishment. Needless to say we paid for our appetizers and went over PT's to eat."}
{"text":"Nice place, great food and Pizza. I will be going back. A great place to eat while at Fremont Street"}
{"text":"Well this place doesn't suck!  Yum-oh! Chicago style deep dish!!! Most excellent - and the bartenders....great service!!!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: BEER AND SERVICE REVIEW ONLY!

I dropped by here and caught a bit of Monday Night Football in the upstairs sports bar area.

The bartender hooked me up with some samples and I ended up enjoying a hefeweizen (although they call it something else) and a stout.

I preferred the hefeweizen to the stout. It had a nice finish.

Service was fine, nothing special.  

That is all."}
{"text":"I visited this place quite a while ago, but I can still distinctly remember the reasons why I haven't been back.

First, the wait...we waited a looooong time to be seated, a longer time to be waited upon, and the very longest time to receive our pizza.  I was not impressed with the service at all - if you're gonna make me wait, at least smile when you get to my table.

The pizza arrived almost 45 minutes after we placed our order and it was lukewarm, which suggested to me that it had been sitting for a while.  My fiancé and I were only one of two tables at the time, so it's kind of incredible that our waitress forgot about us.  When I asked for Parmesan, I got a sticky, goopy, flat-out nasty shaker...aren't you supposed to clean those from time to time??  The pizza itself was okay...the sauce was pretty unusual.  It was a meat sauce, almost like they had run out of regular pizza sauce and subbed a pasta sauce instead.  It was bizarre-tasting and had an equally bizarre texture.

I hate feeling like I've wasted my money.  This was one meal I'd definitely take back if I could."}
{"text":"Fun place with good drinks and food.  Perfect for a group of friends to hit on the weekend and try some unique items.  We ordered the wild game sliders which included Alligator, Antelope, Bison, Jackelope, Rabbit & Wild Boar!  Now of course some were better than others but just to say you had them is a conversation starter.  Also they have a ghost pepper sauce that is not on the menu but if you like it spicy ask for a side of it.  They also have deep fried desserts if you're brave enough."}
{"text":"They have a friendly staff. Food is always great. I'm from Chicago...& this is pretty darn good. Love their pizza. One of the closest to the real deal. Their hot dog is my favorite. 

Can't forget their homemade brewed root beer. You can get a jug really cheap. I get the root beer to go..and buy vanilla bean ice cream..so good. Gotta try it. And if you bring back the jug you can get a refill for cheaper. Also you can buy their home brewed beers in jugs too. Refills also cheaper."}
{"text":"Tasty food, been coming here on and off for years. Machines aren't bad, won some and loss some. Cocktails and beers for all"}
{"text":"The service that we received today was absolutely extraordinary! Our waitress, Ronika, was fantastic! This was our first time here and we definitely will be returning here because of her excellent customer service! Thank you for making our first experience incredible."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go in Vegas. Excellent service and wings. Not to mention superb draft beer. You get a REAL drink here unlike the strip. Bob and Kimmy really make this place great!! The pipe smoker and royal flush winner!!!"}
{"text":"YAYY! I found a brewery in Las Vegas!! Great brews and even better the space! So much room and things going on at this spot. Almost a little brewery/sports bar. Then again this is Vegas...lol 

Thanks Nadine for great brews! We'll see you all again EDC WEEKEND!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say they absolutely do not deliver on a good pizza!  Nothing at all worthy of the name on their building!  They do however have a good IPA \"Hardway\" but wonder if they even make it here!  Resident here and in the past have enjoyed coming but just can't find my way to coming back!  Sorry!  There has to be better pizza in Las Vegas!  Gonna find it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the Deep Dish and Chicago Dogs. The beers were good too - I had the Irish stout!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Brewery Stop #3

They have a restaurant and a bar area with the brewery in the middle, which you can see through glass windows. Open 24 hrs. We tried there:

All Nighter Light Ale
Ramblin' Reck Amber Ale
Old Town Brown
Hardway IPA
Weizenheimer
Black Widow Stout
Seasonal: Raspberry Wheat
Seasonal: Belgian Double
Seasonal: Honey Ale?

All the beers were light...flavorful, but not too exciting. The most exciting thing was that they have a variety of sliders with different meats....alligator, antelope, bison, jackelope, rabbit, wild boar. You can order a sampler for $30. I wish we could have tried them, but we were short on time.  Next time."}
{"text":"If you like hot wings try the spicy with a couple drops of ghost pepper sauce.  Gives it a good kick!"}
{"text":"Wow great staff... You guys rock.
Whiskey and coke...check
Stout... phenominal, 
Hefeweizen.. oh my beloved tastebuds.. Lucky Vegas goers??? (That is not a real word right hahaha?) Root beer is like old fashioned Hires made with the dry ice. I honestly would give these guys 10 stars. Thanks for a great experience.... When in Vegas this is the place."}
{"text":"Sitting here now and had to write a review the food was such a let down. The filet mignon sliders were such a disappointment I managed to get one bite down. The aju sauce was basically brown water, no seasonings, mushrooms tasted rotten, and it came with a side of plain lettuce?? I can't say about the beers but with food like this I could imagine drink till it tastes good"}
{"text":"Deep dish was perfect. Cheese was the ideal texture--stringy, creamy and chewy. Perfect.! We also got a order of chicken strips with hot sauce and they hit the spot!  I enjoyed my large beer. Good meal for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Very good selection of beer at very reasonable prices. The food is also very good, my only complaint was the service was horrible. I will try it again hoping for much improved service."}
{"text":"I got really bad food poisoning from here on Sunday March 4, 2012. I think it was from a salad. Avoid at all costs! Mediocre pizza too."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to celebrate daughter's graduation from UNLV.  They were having their Holiday party and we were told it was Open Bar from 6-9. Could not believe it.  Was also informed a free prime rib buffet.  Had a great time.  We'll definitely be back even if we have to pay. Lol"}
{"text":"We came on the recommendation of Desert Companion's best-of eating issue, so I was expecting the good stuff.  What I got was a pizza and a tall Stout, which both turned out to be mediocre.  

What I should have gotten, apparently, was their burger fare.  Between the game sliders (with sweet potato fries, yum!) and the HUGE barbeque burger, I felt like I'd made a mistake with my tiny, thin-crust mini-pizza.  The stout seemed weak-tasting, but I'm the kind of person who likes a dark beer that can hold a spoon in it.  The hef my friend ordered seemed like a far better, tastier option for Vegas' summer. 

The loft area would be great if there were a couple tables instead of being purely for two people to eat / groups to drink in."}
{"text":"Great service and a cozy bar environment. They have a back section where you can get away from people and chat with your friends. They have deep dish pizza, but just like Windy City, it's not REALLY deep dish. It's not deep enough! I don't understand why they can't make the crust thicker by using a deeper pan. The crust was REALLY good though and the pizza, in general, was delicious, so I'm not going to complain too much. They brew their own beer, too; I had their light ale and it was very drinkable. :) If I'm in the area again, I'll stop in fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"From the outside the place looks great. Inside decor is not so much - nothing special. Saturday night place was kind of dead, yet the service was really slow. Our server asked if we wanted to reuse our beer glasses and we were drinking different kinds of beers.  Food came out, our server did not ask if we wanted refills on our drinks - glasses were empty. Food was pretty good and seemed fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but this time stands out.....

Rocco and Steve run a great establishment and the craft beers are second to none (try the \"All Nighter\"), the new menu items are killer (Filet Skewers) and I'd come back just to try them again.

Ask for MJ, Jake, Brady, Erin, Alan, Brian or Jesse behind the bar, there's no better spot for \"industry\" when we all get off of work.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Chicago Brewing Company (CBC) is alright in my book. They're open 24/7 and have consistently decent food. The variety isn't much and there's nothing healthy options on the menu. 

I will highlight that the soups and house-made root beer are too legit to quit. The bar section is separated from the actual restaurant. Happy Hours during the game are extended into the main dining room.

Good service, decent prices, and portions are large. I always need a to-go box when dining here."}
{"text":"This place would totally be 5 out of 5 hands-down, but I'm pretty bummed with it recently. We have been regulars since we moved to Vegas last year but in the last few months they have gotten new managers that have not only changed the menu but gotten rid of the happy hour in the dining area. Which is a bummer if you ask me because if you have littles or you simply hate being hot-boxed in cigarette smoke you obviously can't nor do you want to sit in the bar. They've also gotten rid of the sweet potato fries which is an absolute sin in my opinion. Haha I know that sounds a little dramatic but they were amazing!! I'm hoping this review secretly brings them back:)
Other than that this place is pretty awesome! Service is great! Food is delish- not your typical bar food. I highly recommend the black and blue sliders. They're out of this world. And of course, the house brewed beers are awesome!! And super cheap. 
Bring back my sweet potato fries and happy hour and we'll move back in:)"}
{"text":"Back in town selling houses and stopped in to one of my favorite brewing houses.  Bobby Dickman (yes, that is his real name- I understand he is still in counseling, lol) was tending bar, serving food, checking on patrons, and basically doing everything.
Bobby is a one man band.  The most amazing thing about Bobby is that he never forgets a face, or a name, or an order.  An affable fella.  The 4 Queens are lucky to have him.
The Philly cheesesteak was average today.  Loads of quantity. Not so much on quality.  However, the atmosphere is relaxing, the beer is cold, and Bobby's easy going nature and good humor makes this site an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Excellent beer menu and beer flights. Still allows cigars in the bar. I had the muffaletta they have the meats right but the bu and olive spread are not really well suited for a muffaletta sandwich. They would be better off calling it an Italian sandwich. The fries were awesome and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place to visit and have drinks and finger food with friends. The beer is pretty good and the food is tasty (try their wings--they are very good). I would have given it 4 stars but the service was not the best...table was a little sticky, first pizza was unusually sweet (they apparently put brown sugar on their caramelized onions) and the waitress forgot about us a couple of times. Overall, not a bad place to visit."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes... and YES! 

Stopped in for a quick bite before a concert downtown and wow am I impressed and so relieved. I truly gave up on finding decent Chicago-Style pizza. Not only did I find that, but as well they have great tasting crafts on draft and iced cold! 

Started off with the sampler of crafts. Literally a carousel of 9 samples for only $9 bucks! The drinks were great and threw in a side of calamari to start. 

Now normally I have low expectations on calamari as I generally know where to go to have a great appetizer portion of calamari. (An authentic Italian restaurant!) However, this place - best Calamari since my review in Tucson. 

Ordered the Deep Dish pizza (no meat #vegetarian) and again - decent size and definitely enough for 2-3 people (with appetizers and drinks of course). The red sauce was bold but balanced. Amazing stringy cheese when you pull out a slice and not too much dough - which really set it off. 

All in all very impressed and happy to have found a go-to Chicago Style eatery in downtown Las Vegas. It's located in the Four Queens. 

The only caution I would give is if you are sensitive to cigar smoke, this may not be the place for you. Yea - that's right! It duals as a cigar bar and this guy is not offended one bit. As matter of fact the sweet smells of cigar tobacco while eating the rich buttery Deep Dish and refreshing sampler was enough to have me sit back and my chair and feel a great amount of contentment. 

An absolutely must for pizza downtown!"}
{"text":"Brad is I great bartender had me feeling like I wanted and the Hefe beer here is awesome. They also sell cigars. I also like there pizza it was delicious.  They have a great happy hour from 4 -6pm. I'm not a big beer drinker but they even have a good alcohol happy hour special. . If you are looking for some good beer come to Chicago Brewery and have a drink but make sure you come while Brad is bartending AF Get A Hefe with a shot of blueberry Vodka."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good beers, good apps and good prices! It's literally a 10 min walk from my house. Every time I come here, I order the All Nighter - never fails me!"}
{"text":"The signature deep dish pizza is absolutely delicious! Oooy goooey cheese, crisp crust, and fresh pizza sauce make for a perfect late night dinner. We shared the chicken strips too and they were lightly crispy and the meat was super moist, not greasy at all. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is great for beers, but food choices are limited. For $2.00, you will get the 16oz glass and for an extra .50 you can upgrade to the 22oz. The two beers I was struggling between were the Seasonal Daisy Triple and the Fruit Seasonal Mango Hef. Jeff, our server, was helpful in helping me choose between the two. I was looking for a lighter beer and he steered me toward the first option and offered me a sample to make sure I enjoyed it before I committed. The beer was a nice balance to the snack that we ended up getting.

With four choices of food on the happy hour menu, we decided to get something to tide us over and wait until later to get real food. We decided on the chicken tenders ($6) tossed in the Brew-BQ sauce with a side of ghost sauce. I had experience the insane heat of ghost sauce before and was willing to press my luck again. My lips were on fire and I was in sweet agony. I am truly a sadist when it comes to hot and sour foods. If pain is not something you strive for while eating, don't get this sauce. Jeff was kind enough to keep watch on our waters. I drink a lot while eating and it was only intensified ten folds. The tenders came in an order of five large, juicy strips, dosed in the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Located inside the Four Queens, the restaurant is easy to spot when entering. It is all self seating and a free for all in trying to find an empty table. 

This past Friday was slammed and I am not sure if Pride had anything to do with it. It could be that this restaurant is always jam packed. Anyways, our party of three found a spot near the bar and situated down. Normally the waitresses will bring the menu, but they were busy, so I snagged a couple. 

When our waitress appeared, she was quick to take our drink orders. The specialty beer right now is a Mango Hef. A pint goes for $4 and the larger one is $5. 

The menu is drastically smaller than the Rampart location, but they do have a few vegetarian friendly dishes. My friend and I ordered a Greek Salad and a Vegetarian Pizza. Our waitress was sweet enough to have the salad split for us with the dressing on the side. The amount that we each got was large. Too bad the dressing was mainly oil. Even after mixing it up, the oil was predominantly what ended up on the salad. The pizza was good. The crust was soggy in certain areas, but that tends to happen with a veggie pizza. The nice chunks of zucchini or squash, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives gave many different textures. The seasoning that they used on their crust was something we found ourselves wiping up.

Because it was so busy, the staff were not too concern with putting away dishes in a quiet manner. We heard every clank and clunk as dishes were thrown into bus tubs. There were not any refills either or an attempt to check in on us."}
{"text":"Specialty beer is definitely worth a try. Everything else is decent beer. Very good resemblance of Chicago style food like their pizza"}
{"text":"Beers were a mix bag, some good, some not (to be expected), service was good, though they goofed on the bill. Chicken strip were very good, above average chicken went into making them, that was clear. Perfectly cooked as well.. Only thing I'd suggest is asking for them to be tossed in the sauce, they serve it drizzled on which leaves some bites with more flavor than others. The teriyaki sauce was extremely sweet as well, more than most I've tried."}
{"text":"A great place to come and enjoy yourself! I have only been to the bar a few times but plan to check out the upstairs soon. The regulars who attend are as much fun and notable as the staff, which are always friendly and nice. I haven't had a bad experience here yet, and the food is always so good!"}
{"text":"Is this the only place in Vegas where if you go during happy hour you don't get the happy hour prices if you sit at the bar? But you can move 5 feet away to a table to get the happy hour deals, makes no sense, especially if your gambling. And they only have 3 food items, 10\" pizza, garlic knots and pretzel bites. (During happy hour) too many rules! Maybe they should have a flyer with all the restrictions!"}
{"text":"Trent the cook made me a pretty delicious breakfast sandwich with home style potatoes at 4 a.m., hit the spot for a late night bite."}
{"text":"Great food. Bartenders are hit and miss.
Brady who is a bartender there is awesome. There is also some Hispanic lady there and it seems like she hates her job. 

People don't go to a bar to just drink. They go to talk to someone and having an impersonal bartender does not go along very well.

For shock factor. Their ghost pepper wings are awesome.
Food is always good and reasonably priced for the area.

Do try their happy hours. Chicken nuggets for $8 during happy hours. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"We came to try this place again, we'd been here a few years ago and brought guests, I don't remember what we ate, it wasn't that impressive, so my husband and I thought we'd try it again.

I was trying to stick with a fairly health meal and I ended up ordering the soldier's cobb salad.  It has chopped tomatoes, egg, smoked bacon, and crumbled blue cheese tossed over mixed greens.  It was a decent size and very fresh.  My husband got the ribs and chicken.  I was able to try a few of the ribs and they were very good.  

Our service was good, the food was decent, since they brew their own beers, it will be something we come back for to try another day."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood where this place is located. I used to go there all the time. They USED TO have some really great food but over the past year the food and service have declined horribly to the point where I will never again spend another dime in this place. The last few times I have tried to order food from there they have messed up my order. I ordered a pizza with artichokes and instead they put anchovies on it and no artichokes! It was SO NASTY!!! Also, it looked like they forgot to put the sauce on the pizza and then put it on last minute as the sauce was on the TOP of the cheese! Never seen a pizza like that in my life, or a nastier excuse for a pizza for that matter! Recently I decided to give them another chance and tried to order the meatball sliders. My boyfriend phoned in the order which they took, only to call him back 10 minutes later and tell him that they've taken the meatball sliders off the menu. They couldn't have told him that when he called and ordered it in the first place? Rude & unknowledgeable staff. They recently cut their menu in half, or more. They took everything that was good off! Baked ziti, gone! Quesadilla, gone! Chicken cordon bleu sliders, gone! Meatball sliders, gone! Chicago hotdog, gone! Pot roast, gone! I literally have no reason to ever return to this place again. Way to piss off & lose all your loyal customers Chicago Brewing Co.! Also, I think the old hag, rude, nasty female bartender who bar tends downstairs threw my iphone 6 in the garbage there & claimed that it was never found when I called right after I left! Also, the last time I was inside, I saw the upstairs male bartender (Not Josh) refuse to take a pregnant woman's food order because he was too busy serving hipsters alcohol. This place just doesn't care about it's customers."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time to try out the beer and the service was excellent. We were immediately accommodated and seated on the patio. We ordered an appetizer and a sampler of all 9 beers and they all came within 5 mins of placing our order. The beer sampler was very easy to understand which one we were tasting and the beers exceeded our expectations. The appetizer we ordered was delicious and even being the only people on the patio we were continuously checked on. The manager James was exceptional. He greeted us when we came in and was very friendly, accommodating and even gave us a tour of the building and the beer brewing process. We left with an overwhelming feeling to tell people how great of an experience it was coming here. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza was awesome, the wings were good, the chicken tenders were really tender, the potatoes skins were some of the best. And the IPA was fantastic."}
{"text":"Three words: Brad, Brady and Jake.  The best bartenders in Vegas.  True story.  The Llyods to my Jack.  Chicago is the Cheers for Vegas.  Everybody knows your name.  They are always glad you came.  

Not only is Chicago Brewing company one of the best zombie apocalypse strongholds in Summerlin,  the food is always on point.  Chipotle ranch 4 lyfe. 

Shout out to Jake for his stellar performance in The Hunger Games as Peeta Mellark"}
{"text":"The beers are extremely well done. Would definitely return and sample more of the lineup. They could put a little more effort into the pizza, kind of a half-hearted attempt at Chicago-style. It wasn't bad and I would eat it again but it's not anything I'd get excited about and I can get excited about deep dish."}
{"text":"I have yet to try their pizza.

Great buffalo chicken sliders though. They also run reasonably priced lunch specials which were a great alternative to having to pick between Jack In The Box or Taco Bell during the days I was at Euphoria. They have an awesome happy hour and a vast selection of beer. Oh, and did I mention that their garlic knots are to die for?

Okay, I'll update this with a review of the pizza some other time. 

The Final(ish) Verdict

Pros: 
Great food
Great happy hour specials
Strong drinks
Great service
Steampunk-ish vibe and old-timey ambiance
24 Hours

Cons:
While the service is attentive, they can be slow to get your food to you at times.

Return Factor: 10/10. I still need to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Normally i have an okay time here. My last visit wasnt even okay. 

I didnt even get a chance to eat here and had to leave due to the terrible service. We took a seat at the bar and ordered the deep dish pizza we were craving all diggity day long and a brown ale, along with a couple waters. Then we watched the bartenders behind the bar have internal drama and not even look in our direction as we waited.....and waited........annnnnnd waited. Neither the bar nor the dining area was busy or even half full and i sat for 17 minutes without even the orders for the waters go fulfilled. 
At that point i had seen enough and had to walk out before the food and drinks even arrived. I hated to do it but i could not support the staff and business where that could happen. 

The bottom line is that it was a bad experience but the food i have had here in the past has always been solid, the beer is surprisingly good and priced very well."}
{"text":"We've been here a lot. Food is great and today the potato and bacon soup was ridiculously awesome. I wanted to take a \"before\" photo but ... Oh well. Gone! Yum."}
{"text":"Usually go for pizza. But this time went for salad,nothing special. And mild wings,naked. Very delicious. Also got chicken tenders. Juicy and big. Very delicious too. Good to know there's other options. A must place to eat while you're in downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"The Chicago style deep dish pizza is to die for! My husband and I agree this is one of the best pizzas we've ever had! We stumbled in here by accident and now we always make a stop here. Feels like a hidden treasure. We actually had it two days in a row.. beats the buffet in quality and flavor. The bread is so soft and doughy. The cheese is so flavorful, you can tell it's top quality."}
{"text":"The look of the building made me feel right at home. We have these types of buildings in the midwest so I was looking forward to the visit.  When we walked in we were advised by the hostess that the upstairs would be a fun place to sit, so we went up there. 

Upstairs There are three small  seating areas, but only small group was there. The  first thoughts I had were that the rug looked like it had seen better days and that table bussing was apparently not a priority. The little bar was crowded with happy people and the bartender was great- wonderful smile, nice personality. 

I didn't find the leather club chairs to be especially comfortable and would have preferred a real table, but overall, it wasn't a bad experience. There were two nice flatscreen TVs showing basketball, which the bar group enjoyed loudly. I loved how the natural light looked, streaming in through the windows and hitting the brick walls. Ah, Ohio...

The food? Meh.  When you serve cheese sauce with beer in it, the beer does not make up for using VELVEETA. Ok? REAL cheese, please. The chips weren't that good either. I was so disappointed. I tried the garlic pretzels and they were good, but more like soft, kosher-salted rolls. My friend's steamed clams did not taste fresh to her, but she thought they were ok.  

I don't know that I would come back here. I don't have anything awful to say about it, but I was underwhelmed during this visit."}
{"text":"Walked in to have 'lunch' sat for 15 minutes before realizing we aren't getting service unless we go to the bar that is full and 'reserved for players' as the bartender put it. We came in good hope again hoping for good service go to the bar and the bartender has shitty attitude about asking what a woman was drinking and said I'm not your father I'm not making decisions for you.. I get it's not up to the bartender but no need for the shitty response because he claims to be having a 'bad' day from lack of sleep. 1/10 lost my business."}
{"text":"Great wings, good pizza, and cheap beer. I don't think you could really go wrong if you came here. 

Also the waitress we had was really nice, we had a ton of leftovers and where about to leave them behind because we where going straight from the restaurant to a bar and didn't want to cart the food around so she offered to put them in a box and leave them for us back behind the counter and even if the place was closed by the tie we came back, she said we could still come in and get our food."}
{"text":"I love this place as a bar, I've stopped going to the restaurant half of it years ago.  The last time I ate a couple slices of their small deep dish pizza, I fell into a food coma, and it ruined my Friday night.  I was so stuffed, that I couldn't move. I suppose I should blame myself, but I wouldn't have eaten so much if their pizza wasn't so damn delicious!

We come here pretty regularly during happy hour.  They have good deals on their house beer, and great deals on their appetizers ($3 garlic knots!)  They have kind of a weird system though, happy hour pricing doesn't apply if you're sitting at the actual bar. You can be IN the bar, but you have to sit at a table.  
There's an awesome deal for girls on Saturdays (I believe it's all day). All vodka based drinks are a dollar, and they pour them strong. Again, be careful where you're sitting.  This deal only applies to patrons sitting in the UPSTAIRS bar.  Don't be scared to order something more complex than a vodka-cran.  Things like melon balls, and electric lemonades are included too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chicago and had pizza, and I've been to a lot of restaurants that advertise Chicago-style pizza. With the exception of one restaurant, that being Chicago Brewing Company in the Four Queens Hotel & Casino, not one of them has actually lived up to the claim of having real Chicago-style pizza.
Fortunately, this is that restaurant, so this is a positive review! They apparently have another location across town, but this is the one I've dined in. Several times, in fact.
The restaurant occupies a little nook in the corner of the Four Queens, and though the prices aren't super-cheap (though you can go across the street to one of the sports bars if dollar-fifty hot dogs are your thing), they're quite fair, and the garlic knots include a surprising amount of sustenance for the price. The beers are apparently brewed at the other location, but they're still local, and they're still delicious. So I recommend them highly.
Get the sampler flight. It's not only eye-catching to have a bunch of wee mugs artfully presented on a two-tiered tray, it's a great way of finding out which of the beers you think you'll like are what you really want to drink, and which beers you weren't sure if you'd like at all are actually a lot better than you'd expected. That's how I found their fruity wheat beer (I think it may have been blueberry), and how we decided what to bring home in a growler.
For the pizza? Get it. It's as close as I've ever found to being real Chicago-style pizza, like I've said before. Reviewers of the other location that are *from Chicago* concur. Maybe it's just not entirely possible to make Chicago-style pizza anywhere but Chicago, but these guys come close and it's delicious to boot. They may have other offerings on the menu, but I never bothered to try because I was so happy to find real Chicago-style pizza.
I feel I've probably not said Chicago-style pizza enough times. Chicago-style pizza. Chicago-style pizza. Chicago-style pizza. There we go.
Anyway, if you like what I keep talking about, then go here. If you've never had Chicago-style pizza (in Chicago or anywhere else), try it here if you're in Vegas. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Chicago brewing Co is a 24 hour drinking, gaming and late dining place in the Summerlin area. I really love this place. I used to come here often when I lived close and had a late schedule. Nowadays it is few and far between to have days off and late nights. Anyway my favorite thing about this place is that it has freshly brewed beer. The best beer of my life was had here. It was an apricot heffewissen that they brewed in house. And they don't discriminate either- they make beers in all colors and styles so all beer lovers can enjoy this place no matter what your preference.

The next best thing about this place is the staff. I have been coming here over 5 years and in that time they are one of the only restaurants I have ever seen maintain the level of quality in their products and the same staff. That says a lot about a restaurant. The staff is always friendly, on top of things and it doesn't matter when you come. I love that there is always room in the dining area even when it is busy you never feel ignored by he staff here.

Lastly I of course love the food here. Their menu is pretty varied so even if you want something different every time you come, that is possible here. They have everything from thin or thick crust pizza, to burgers, to steak, quesadillas, sandwiches, sweet potato fries and also full entrees and desserts. My favorite meal here is the chicken quesadilla with a side of sweet potato fries and nacho beer cheese! A lot of food but so worth it. I will for sure be back for awesome beer, awesome food and awesome times here."}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for Chicago Pizza and we didn't want Rosati's, so we grabbed our restaurant.com certificate and jetted to the other side of town.  We didn't expect to get such good food here.  Everything was delicious.

As usual, I didn't go for the pizza.  I love pizza, it just does bad things to my blood sugar, and Chicago Pizza, although tasty, does extra bad things.  I enjoy eating a few bites here and there from my husband so I can get my fix.  In a place like this, I try to reserve my carbs for the beer.

We ordered the following:
The beer sampler - we wanted to try everything so we could decide what we wanted to order (I loved the Weizenheimer and Matt ordered the Black Star Stout)
Brew Wings - Ordered hot, but really weren't hot at all.  They still were crunchy, huge, and just overall yummy.  Some of the best I've had in town.  Instead of celery and blue cheese dressing it had a celery salad which was really cool, crisp and refreshing and I loved it.  Very creative and original.
Baby Brew Salad - I ordered this with a Balsamic Reduction Vinaigrette.  For a side salad this was huge, fresh and delicious.
Deep Dish Meat Lovers Pizza - Matt substituted garlic for Canadian Bacon, not sure why he doesn't like Canadian Bacon since it is just essentially ham!  The whole time he was eating this all he could say was \"wow, this is so good.\"  He was very very happy with the pizza here and this might be his favorite.

I'm not sure how often we'll go here since it is, as I said, not really near where we live.  But with our restaurant.com certificate it was only $20 bucks for all this food and beer which was a bargain.  I am tempted to try the ghost pepper wings on the menu but I am a little scared.  However, with the regular hot wings being so mild I am thinking that they will be mild as well.  I shall have to work myself up to it next time. 

Oh by the way, the beer is wonderful!  Nice to find a place in town that has the beer towers again after The Pub at Monte Carlo stopped serving them."}
{"text":"Very nice place, clean bar area. Its located in 4 queens, kind of hidden though, in the corner of the casino, where you have to walk up stairs. I honestly wouldnt have known about this place had it not been for the reviews on Yelp.

The bad: Not exactly bad, but I wasn't all that impressed with their deep dish. Ive been to Chicago on several occasions, and while I dont know about their regular pizza, the deep dish doesnt taste anywhere remotely close to Chicago. Still good though, and for 10 bucks, not much to complain about. If it was $15 or more, I'd be ticked.

The good: The happy hour. FANTASTIC!!!! Its Mon-Fri from 3-6pm, all apps 1/2 price. The apps were just straight up awesome. I had the wings, calamari, and chicken tenders. Ate the first 2, boxed the last to have later as a snack.  They also had $3 in house beers, but I dont drink beer, so no review there.

Overall, a nice little diamond in the rough. Wasn't crowded, service was good, food was great. Will definitely come back for their happy hour when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 stopped in here this past Friday night because we were all craving pizza. Found a spot to sit in a back corner, and we were greeted pretty quickly. Waiter was friendly and attentive considering they were pretty packed and quickly brought us drinks. We had garlic knots, mozzarella sticks and two 16\" pizzas and had quite a bit of pizza leftover. Everything was delicious! I've never seen so many pepperonis on a pizza in my life. Prices were extremely fair, too."}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas for years and have never been here. Finally getting the chance thanks to Sin City Brew Tours. Enjoying a relaxing evening with friends and love the designated driver! The beers are good and the atmosphere is fun. Stop by with friends."}
{"text":"Among the many...and I mean many.. bartenders in this amazing city, Bob stands among the best. The Man knows his beer and his football, as well. Bartender Kimmie is amazing, too...as is Tiffany...as is Mike...and don't get me started on the kick ass kitchen crew. Two thumbs way UP!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible, service is really good also. The waitress was very knowledable with the menu and was very polite. The deep dish pizza is definitely worth it, I have no problem going back there again for food. Anytime the food and service is top notch then it's a must to return."}
{"text":"Their garlic cheese knots were to die for! LOVED them! They beers were just OK. Their homemade Root Beer was very tasty. The only bad things I would say about this place: my grandfather was in a wheelchair & due to it's 2nd floor location, it was tricky to get to - we had to go up the elevator & through another restaurant to get to it. Also there is limited seating. One side is smoking section & the other is non smoking both are very small. Visiting this place was definitely worth it for the Root Beer & the Cheese Knots. The pizza was just OK."}
{"text":"Not really a true brewery... It's a small room inside the 4 Queens. The \"brewery\" is offsite 7 miles away. 
As a home brewer the beers were nothing I couldn't make at home myself... Maybe I should talk to 4 Queens and I could get a brewery! LOL
Unless you just want to check another \"brewery\" off your list... Not really worth checking out."}
{"text":"This review is only for beer and cigars at the Chicago Brewing Company.  We stopped in here a couple weeks ago and sat at the bar.  The bartender was super friendly and helpful.  I had the beer sampler (see pic) and all the beers were delicious.  Each one seemed to accurately represent that particular style of brewing.  My favorites were the Ramblin Reck Amber Ale, the Old Town Brown and the IPA.  I also smoked a great cigar at the bar.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked great and next time I'll definitely eat.  The beer was really outstanding and so was the service.  Chicago Brewing Company is located on the second floor of Four Queens.  I've been in the casino many times and never seen the restaurant until the day we went there.  The ambiance is typical neighborhood bar...very comfortable and casual.  I'll be back at here every time I'm in the downtown area.  Beer-5 stars, Service-4 stars, Ambiance-3 stars, Value-5 stars, Food-no rating."}
{"text":"try the beer...quad damn it...went home with a growler of it last night..."}
{"text":"Have been customers for many years. Last night we went there for dinner and discovered a \"new menu\". In short, all the entrees have been removed! Now it's just typical \"bar food\". Too bad. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Head upstairs for a quiet and frendly experience.  Brad does a great job of making new visitors feel welcome.  Cosy seating areas as well as small intimate bar area.
GREAT chicken strips.  Try things out during happy hour with good in house beers."}
{"text":"Sunday nights, I don't get out of work until 10 PM. Like many towns, there's not a lot open around 11ish unless you want to pay exorbitant prices on the Strip, or eat fast food. 

Well on Sunday, 4/17/11, Lawrence T., came to see the show I work for and afterward, we were in search of some food. Having missed out on Ken M.'s UYE \"Pizzas, Peppers & Pints\" and living too far away to come here by myself, I was dying to try this place because they serve Ghost Peppers and luckily, it's right around the corner from Lawrence's apartment, so that's where we ended up going.

It was a ghost town when we walked in. There was one person in one booth when we walked on in. We were seated right next to the kitchen. I was torn when I saw the menu. \"Chicken fingers in ghost pepper sauce or ribs.\" It was a tough choice because I'd been dying for ribs for a good week now, and to add insult, my parents had went to Lucille's BBQ earlier that day with my youngest siblings and brought my sister and me back nada. The pull for BBQ was too strong, and I ordered the ribs and fries ($19), and Lawrence ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich ($10)  topped with breaded onion strings, and macaroni salad.

We didn't have to wait too long for our meal to be delivered to us. The food runner switched our plates and seemed a bit surprised that no, the meat was my order. My ribs were good, but not fall off the bone. They weren't the Memphis Dry Rub ribs that I love so much, they were smothered in some sort of BBQ sauce. I regret not trying the Ghost Pepper... anything because common sense tells me I can eat BBQ anywhere. Lawrence took half his sandwich home for the next day but I assume he liked it.

Our bill came out to $31.35 with tax, which is a little steep for late night food, but that's my fault for ordering ribs. Would I be back, eh... only if I'm for sure going to order something with the Ghost Pepper, otherwise, nah."}
{"text":"I don't get down to Fremont Street as much as I did in the past. Let's face it, depending on when you go, the area can be quite sketchy. When I do get down there though, Chicago Brewing is one of the main reasons for it. The staff has always been great, and the beers really good, especially on a hot Vegas day or night.

I really like the pizza, and they do have plenty of other items other than pizza. But, those garlic knots with marinara sauce are the bomb. Put a plate of those in front of me with a tall one, and I'm a happy camper. The place is small, but i think that's part of the charm of it. It would loose some of the allure to me if it was any bigger. Prices are decent as well.

If you like good food, good beer, friendly people, then you're at the right place. But damn, get you some of those garlic knots."}
{"text":"This place was a good place to go for a little snack. We both got a side salad and our own order of wings. The wings were a big portion, and we even took some home. The salad was nothing great, iceburg lettuce a couple grape tomatoes. They are famous for their Bloody Mary menu, and my husband loved it. We always stay at the Four Queens so it was convenient. They have TV, all sports related."}
{"text":"Drinks & appetizers review only 

Decent beer.  The pours are extremely nice here.  You can buy a pitcher of IPA for $20, or a 32 Oz for $13.  We got the pitcher.

The IPA is decent.  It's really a standard IPA.  No complaints about it.  I'd say it's on par w/ BJ's Brewery.

TIPS:
-Located in the \"4-Queens\" Casino in Fremont area
-Inside is pretty old T
-There are lots of TV's inside"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!!!!! I ordered chicken wings and they were pink on the inside so I told my server she said she was going to go to the cook so they can recook them so she did and brought them back out meanwhile my lunch break was over so I had to take them to go a few hours later I try to eat them again and they were still pink. I then went back to talk to the manager and he was the rudest person I've ever met in my life!!! He tried to tell me that All chicken is pink on the inside, when have you ever ate a piece of chicken that is pink on the inside???!!!! That means it is not cooked fully. I am pregnant and I can't be eating raw chicken and get salmonella. Worst customer service ever I will never be going back there and my life!!! Don't give them any of your money!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Pizza is great!! I recommend the thin crust. Very crispy, perfect amount of toppings and tasty. Friendly, fast service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chicago deep dish doors not even come close to Gino's or Giordano's. The happy hour specials are awesome. highly recommend the filet sliders."}
{"text":"I love a good IPA and the Chicago Brew Co has a good one. Albiet a small bar its big on taste and I opt for the sliders and an IPA when I go and leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"You had me at: \"Beer brewed onsite\", \"beer garden\", \"open 24 hours\", \"we cut our own chicken tenders and make the batter here\", \"the posole was made this morning\" and \"can I get you another one\"."}
{"text":"Awful -- we walked out.  We had hoped to enjoy Happy Hour here but after 10+ minutes, no greeting, no server, no nothing.  We asked at the bar and were told to \"Have a seat; someone will come over.\"  No apology, nothing.

Life is too short. We walked out and went to Lazy Dog who appreciated our business very much."}
{"text":"We took a friend out to eat here for his birthday dinner because we wanted something that was \"nice\" but also \"kid friendly\" since he wanted to spend some time with our 2-year-old. Clearly, he doesn't have kids or he wouldn't have said this.
 
It turns out, our server was awesome, the food and drinks came out fast. But hold the phone.. The cinnamon knots for dessert were out of this world!!! Made fresh and served hot, they melt in your mouth, not in your hands! I think I might even pop in some time just to order that and nothing else. 

While I am not, if you are a beer person, this is the place for you! The 2 men I was with thoroughly enjoyed \"beer hopping\" brews they would normally not have the opportunity to try elsewhere. And I happily sipped my glass of red wine, while my son happily enjoyed his milk."}
{"text":"Place has been here forever. I never bothered to try it until tonight. Dinning room was closed had to eat in smoke filled bar....... But wow was the food good. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizzas are small but will definitely fill you up. The food was awesome but the restaurant was small. However I would go back for sure when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Upstairs bar is way better.  Great bar staff.  Quick service.  Cheap beer and wine."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a lazy Monday afternoon with a buddy of mine.   The place was easy to find and it was about half full which was surprising for a Monday afternoon around 1.   We were greeted and shown to a table.   We looked over the beer selection which was pretty decent, but we wanted to try the stuff they brewed.   We both ended up ordering the IPA.  It was good, it had a nice bitterness to it.   Since we really weren't that hungry, we ordered some steak fries to snack on.   Those were pretty good.   It was a good match for the beer.   

Overall, this is a nice place to go.   Will I be back?   Yeah, probably, but I need to see more of what's around first."}
{"text":"Beer was ok, but the in house root beer was fantastic - give it a shot. The food was ok, but certainly one of the better options Freemont and the prices were right. 

Our waiter was very pleasant. Was not swooned by the place, but I'd return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This was possibly one of the worst places I've eaten at based on the service and lackluster food. While you can see the wait staff walking around the restaurant constantly, don't expect them to check in too often. Repeatedly through out our meal, my boyfriend had to flag down people that were servicing other tables because our waitress was nonexistent. I wanted to split my meal with my boyfriend and no extra dish was given to do so. We ordered a pasta dish but, it was so bland we didn't finish it. At the end of the meal, due to our party size, we were charged an 18% gratuity. I can't justify 18% gratuity when I saw our waitress once to take our orders and a second time to disperse our meal. We also waited a tremendous amount of time for our meal (45 minutes). After all that waiting, our food was lukewarm/room temperature when it got to the table."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, service not so much. Mellow mood on a Sunday afternoon during football season. Deep dish pizza is super saucy which I loved. Too bad it's the second time I've been here and service fell short both times ... don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Great beer here, and a better atmosphere to boot.  I ventured out to this place and was quite impressed with the beer offerings that they had.  I had the Black Star Stout, the Hardway IPA and the All Nighter and all of them were stellar.  For dinner I had the Cajun pasta, which I would highly recommend to anyone.  The guy sitting next to me at the bar, who appeared to be a regular, told me the deep-dish pizzas here were stellar, but since I was a party of one I thought that a whole deep dish would be too much my waistline.  The rest of the menu appeared to be standard brewery fare with a solid selection of pastas, pizza, sandwiches, burgers and appetizers.

The atmosphere of this place was kinda nice.  Downstairs had a enclosed smoking area bar (where I learned the bartenders can take your food order but not deliver it to your table due to smoking laws; they leave you food right outside the section, tell you it's ready and you have to get it yourself) complete with many TVs, and there was an upstairs section as well that had a Golden Tee machine and a cigar lounge.  There also was a normal dining area and a patio as well.

Service in the smoking area of the bar was a bit slow, as the bartenders seemed a bit preoccupied by the girls at the end of the bar rather than my empty beer glass, but I can't really blame them too much since the girls were hot.

Great food, great beer, great atmosphere.  Hit his place up if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I spent a few hours here today and must say I was impressed. 

The food once ordered was top notch, delivered fast, was plentiful and was fresh and tasty.

I sat upstairs at the Bar with a few local/regular patrons and they were both inviting and great to talk to about current events and most importantly micro brews.

I love heff beers and theirs was pretty darn good. When I commented on the color and taste the bar tender I believe his name was Max was happy to share his extensive knowledge on the subject.

Its a pretty far drive from home but if Im in the area I will be happy to stop in and have a great brew, great food and great company."}
{"text":"I really would give this place four stars if it wasn't for the fact they allow smoking in the bar. Cigars too, which I guess is a selling point with them. I was under the impression that a bar that serves food in Nevada couldn't have smoking, but I guess not here. It's too bad really because the food is good, the beer was awesome, and the bartenders were friendly, but ultimately I couldn't take noxious cigar smoke from other patrons wafting over my food. Just a thing to keep in mind if you're a non-smoker."}
{"text":"Was here for Small Business Saturday, and scored a giant pint glass for $10. A decent price, and for $15 they will fill it with a cold one.
The bar area is typical poker bar chic (I use that term loosely) and is relatively inviting. Chicago Brewing usually has some unique flavors on tap, and I was pleased to enjoy a Coconut Porter. This one deserves kudos, the coconut was not too prevalent but was definitely there. I haven't had their food in a while, and ran out of time to get some garlic knots or pizza. Outdoor seating is available too."}
{"text":"Everything is good in this restaurant.  I love it so much, but their salads in particular are the best in all the valley.  I think its because they're plentiful and just plain delicious!  Beer and wine offerings are always very impressive.  This place is great for kids or even a casual date.  Or a girls date night.  Enjoy this locals spot in vegas."}
{"text":"The mango habanero wings are fuego  Great drinking snack. Not spicy like the name implies. I also had their guava beer and it was great! Not too sweet, and definitely for people that don't like strong beers."}
{"text":"YUCK, YUCK, and MORE YUCK, or is it YUM, YUM, YUM?

If you are a smoker, especially an excessive one...you just may like this place.  A little mini-casino, but mainly a bar with food.  Horrible ventilation, so you walk into a complete and utterly thick and smelly fog.

For the rest of us, the non-smokers -- no way no how."}
{"text":"in my opinion, pizza & beer is kinda hard to mess up, but this place is really, really good.  i'm  a fan of Chicago's Lou Malnatis and this place is almost as good.  if you can't fly to Chicago for pizza, then definitely enjoy the pizza here."}
{"text":"Nice spot to meet up wit frenz & chill out...They got the upstairs 4 folks 2 get loud...Family area downstairs, if U got the kids...Amy & I went 2 this joint & thru down a few beers...DAMN!!!  Took us a memorable glass home 2...Food is aight...I-candy, 4 sho..."}
{"text":"Gambling at the bar was ignored by the bartenders and staff the people their right now 9/3/17 should all be let go I can't believe how terrible this place is and I will reflect it to all my guest downtown"}
{"text":"So yah, here I go with yet another Groupon-related review!

I have wanted to check out this location for a while. Honestly, if I'm in the area I'm usually too tempted by some of the other restaurants to check this place out, but I'm glad I finally took the plunge.

I came with my two fellas for some burgers and beer. I ordered the Bar Brew-Q Burger, as did my main fella and my friend Ryan B ordered the Chili Burger. I was very happy with my food. Huge, I'll definitely be doing some sharing next time I'm there. The burger was moist, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Great price for the quantity and quality. 

To top that glutton fest off, we couldn't resist some delectably indulgent deep-fried treats. We ordered the deep-fried ho ho, honey bun and caramel apple (I refuse to type carmel, lol). They were interesting options and I was quite happy with the choices. I liked the honey bun and apple the best, but I definitely would suggest sharing at this place. 

The beers are great too. Tasty and they go well with the pub grub. We'll definitely be checking this place out more regularly."}
{"text":"Pizza and beer. A match made in heaven. I've been hearing some great word of mouth about this place for ages and have been dying to try it. Finally, I got my chance. 

I ordered the white pizza and a hef. The garlicky goodness was so badass. I love when white pizza is done right. It's a hard trick, but they pull it off flawlessly. The beer is fantastic as well. I'm psyched to try their rootbeer on my next trip. It looked so refreshing, 

There are quite a few other menu items that caught my eye as well, so I look forward to my next visit there. It'll definitely be sooner than later. I'll have to add this to my regular rotation in town. 

Love it."}
{"text":"Oh Chicago, it pains to me to write this bad review. I was a frequent customer, my husband was a huge fan of this restaurant. But they had to change. They removed the happy hour on the dining room and they changed the menu. 

Tonight me and my family went to eat dinner, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup which was way way way too salty and peppery. Our burgers was OK, but the most disappointing item was the chocolate cake. Oh the cake! Haha it costed us $7 for a small chocolate cake drown in chocolate syrup, not ganache with a pitiful scoop of ice cream. The ice cream was so small. I am getting my cake from cheesecake factory next time!!

The server didn't even fill our empty water, and the host didn't say anything when we are leaving, sorry chicago, we will never go back"}
{"text":"Get off the beaten path and try this place out!  Great food, great service and reasonable prices.  A must to try is the blackened chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, we sat up in the loft area.  There was a pungent overpowering smoke odor and I just felt like I wanted to shower as soon as I got home to get the smell out of my hair.  We sat at a table and one of us had to get up each time and order pitchers at a time since it took awhile to get drinks.

The second time, I sat with a few friends at the tables on the first floor by the fireplace.  The service was extremely slow and I realized after awhile it was because the main bartender was also running around grabbing table orders too.  I'm not sure if that's usually how it is, but that definitely caused a delay in service.  Again, we'd preemptively order a couple drinks at once to hold us over until he came back around.

Don't ask why, but I ordered the ahi tuna salad. At a bar. Hmm.  It was actually pretty okay though.  Too much salad to tuna ratio, but it was okay.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The general agreement from my other friends about the food was that it was okay.

If I was rating just beer, I would give this place 4 stars.  They have a house blueberry vanilla kinda beer that is really yummy.  Their house beers are good and I'd go back for that alone.  I really like their house blonde, it's light and tasteful.  But the service is just terrible and the food is just okay. And they don't have that famous big glass drink thing they used to that I've heard people talk about (sorry for the ambiguity since I've never actually seen it)."}
