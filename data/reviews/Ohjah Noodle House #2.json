{"text":"In our quest for more ramen, we tried this place after the review in the Sun, and previous good experience at their steakhouse. Very tasty, quiet on a Monday night with no crowd or line. We had the tonkatsu, and both thought the pork wasn't as tender as other places. Limited beer selection, we got the Nigori sake and it was great. Good garlic edamame."}
{"text":"I have to say much  better than I thought it would be, definitely try the Oxtail Ramen number one. You have to finish up with the mochi ice cream so very fantastic but not better than the surprisingly great lychee saki chilled fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen, amazing staff and the fried rice is to die for. So glad they finally opened a ramen house near where we live. Anyone that loves ramen like us needs to come here and enjoy the friendly atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Five stars for everything EXCEPT ..... As we were enjoying the great food and service, as we have on several previous occasions, a healthcare worker sat down next to our table in hospital scrubs.  Nowadays there are too many bugs, like MRSA, floating around medical facilities to risk exposing the general public.  The few minutes needed to change into street clothes are little to ask for avoiding such risk.  All good restaurants should discourage such carelessness by patrons.  European countries strictly enforce more considerate behavior by patrons."}
{"text":"Eric and his staff took care of our large party with perfection.  Food came out fast, hot and delicious. Next time we're in town, we will be back.  Kids and parents loved the food."}
{"text":"I had the tonkatsu soup and it's very good.  Employees are friendly.  Planning our next visit here again."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service was great.  The interior was nicely designed, well lit.  I hate to give two stars but the smell was awful.   There appeared to be some sort of plumbing problem causing sewer gasses to come up into the dining room.  I'd guess they had a dry p trap or broken vent line or issue with the grease trap.  I complained to the server and she brought out a manager who was very nice and agreed he thought there was a problem too.  I suggested some of the likely causes of the sewer gas and suggested they check the drains and traps.  What is frustrating is when he said he was aware of the issue and a he though he new where the problem was coming from.  So why wasn't it being addressed??  The restaurant was great and a ramen place is needed in this address but the fact that is smells like a pig fart is a turn off.  No one wants that.  Please let us know when the plumbing is fixed we'd like to come back but won't if it stinks like a truck stop restroom ...  I know that's harsh but it is true so I hope it motivates the management to have a sense of urgency about it.... Just saying it's costing you business.  At least I am letting you know about it.  Believe me everyone notices as soon as they walk in the door.  You may be used to it as an employee but as a diner it can't be ignored."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp Ramen and house combo Ramen with the oxtail.  Both were amazing. Service was very good and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Came in for the grand opening.  Very nice decor and great friendly staff.  We both enjoyed our meal which was fresh, hot and delicious.  Don't overlook this place if you're looking for great food at reasonable prices.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the front door, I was immediately and enthusiastically greeted by the staff and was promptly seated. The inside décor of the restaurant is very modern, clean, warm and inviting. The waitress was very friendly, attentive and informative. Despite being the only server at the time of our visit, she quickly took our orders and I was impressed with how quickly the food came to the table. 
        I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which came standard with chashu, bean sprouts, scallion, wood fungus, soft-boiled egg, seaweed, and of course ramen noodles. You could also add additional and extra of any of the toppings for a fee. The ramen came to the table nice and hot. The broth had a cloudy, white, creamy appearance and all of the ingredients were separately laid in the bowl for you to mix together. The noodles were not too thin and not too thick. They were cooked so they were soft, but still had a little bit of a bite in the middle. The soup had a good salty and umami flavor and a deep earthy aroma. The broth left a creamy, gelatinous film in your mouth and the soup had a lot of textural contrast thanks to the various mix-ins. The chashu was fall apart tender and added a nice sweet and slightly smoky flavor and aroma. The beans sprouts and scallions added a nice crunch to the soup, while the wood fungus had a crunch and jelly-like softness. The soft-boiled egg was perfectly cooked. The white of the egg was firm and the yolk had a nice custard-like texture. The seaweed was two big squares of nori that were placed in the bowl. It was difficult to eat until it absorbed moisture from the soup, then it left a mush of seaweed that gave the soup a hint of ocean aroma that if not eaten quickly enough became very pungent. Overall, it was a very well balance bowl of ramen, both texturally and flavor wise."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Customer service is great and the food is very yummy. Most definitely I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this Ramen house around their Grand opening. 

Place: Nicely designed place (even to the back and toilet facilities)and lots of tables and spacious. They even have a beautiful  long table for 8 persons. 
 
Service: nice and prompt. 

Food: Takoyaki - one of the best in town. We tried 5 different ramen (House, Beef,Oxtail, Shoyu and Tantanmen) and underwhelmed with the taste of the broth except for the Tantanmen. Oxtail also was still tough to eat with chopsticks. 

Overall: Decent place. I live in the east side of town and a Fukumimi regular but wanted to try something else. I like that this place is  new, no wait and roomy but still prefer Fukumimi's ramen flavors."}
{"text":"Date night! My fiance and I usually go the the Ohjah Noodle House on Durango. We have been waiting for this location to open as it is a block from my house! Great service and the food is amazing! So happy this location is finally open. This will be a frequent date night spot for us!"}
{"text":"So happy when Ohjah opened. It's close to our house and I'm always in the mood for ramen!! No longer have to drive far to get my ramen fix. Miso ramen, tonkatsu ramen and fried rice are yummy. Wish they served crispy rice with spicy tuna though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite to go ramen place! Thanks god there are more ramen places open up in Henderson. The broth is on point. Portion is good. Staffs are friendly. Definitely can compare to Fukumimi. Will be back more often during winter!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the place is good. On the other hand food is okay. We ordered tonkotsu and ox tail Ramen. Tonkotsu's broth is pretty normal but the chashu that came with it was delicious. 4.5 for tonkotsu. The ox tail ramen though is what I would say what I would remember when I think of ohjahs. The broth is very tasty and satisfying. For the price... they are a little bit more than most here in vegas..."}
{"text":"Ohjah Noodle is a cute little restaurant that's been open only a year. It specializes in Japanese ramen, which I normally don't eat. The ramen was actually good and not overpowered with too many non-typical ramen ingredients. The broth was smooth without being too salty. I got a side of pork belly that's offered as a topping and also came in my pork soup. I liked how it had crispy edges. The service was excellent. I was pleased to hear they also offer udon, which is my preference in Japanese soups. I'll be trying that next time."}
{"text":"They have a good selection. I got the miso ramen The broth had good flavor. They noodles were also good. All I had to do was add a little chili for some spice and it was perfect. Not like some other places I have tried that I had to add spice and seasoning to give it flavor. We also tried the gyoza not the best I had eaten but they were good. 

This is a great addition to Henderson. There are not many places to choose from around here for ramen."}
{"text":"I am one happy bunny! I am elated to have a good noodle house up on the east side. All the Ramen comes with all the standards shredded onions, egg and wood fungus so there's no need to order extra. I recommend the black garlic oil, if you like it. My friend got the Shoyu Ramen and said hers was a little bland.  They also have oxtail yum! For an appetizer we got the squid skewers and they were also very very good, crunchy and had a great sauce."}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese flavors especially if you like a great noodle bowl. I got the Tan Tan Men noodle bowl, which includes grown pork, scallions , seaweed, wood fungus, spinach, bread sprouts , and topped with soft boiled egg on top. I asked for their house extra chili sauce on the side which gives it a delicious spicy kick. I've been back a few more times, but always end up getting their pork potstickers and Tan Tan Men noodle bowl. I highly recommend this place everything is made fresh and will jee you coming back for more ."}
{"text":"Very nice and fast customer service... food is great and their presentation of everything is also awesome. I would recommend coming here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh noodles! I had the veggie ramen and loved it. My mom had a pork rice dish with mushrooms and it was great too!"}
{"text":"My husband and i both had the miso soup, i added corn. It was delicious!! For an appetizer we had edamame , shrimp tempura and for dessert we had green tea cheesecake and red bean mochi which was really yummy too! Service was decent, they were pretty busy so we had to track down our waitress constantly but she did her best. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite place to go if we are craving for Ramen noodles! Their Ohjah House Ramen and the Miso Ramen are our favorite. We also love their Takoyaki. 
And all their staff here are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen spot in Henderson. We have been here twice and most definitely will be going back again. The decode is welcoming and clean and the service was  very hospitable. We had the wasabi tako and house fried rice for our apps both times. This is the best fried rice I have ever had, and of course the rice is made with pork belly. For the entree I had there house ramen both times and it was very good. My wife had the miso ramen on the first visit and the shrimp ramen the second and loved both. They have a good selection of different ramens on the menu (next time I am trying the spicy). Even if your not a ramen fan, you need to stop in for the fried rice, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Soup had no real flavor. I asked for no hard boiled egg in my soup. The put egg in it anyway. Better flavor with top Ramon soup."}
{"text":"In wasn't on the menu, but my server recommended the chicken ramen. YUM!!! Hubs had the chicken katsu. It was fresh. Not an empty seat in the place! Highly recommend for your ramen fix."}
{"text":"The noodle is decent. I stopped by on the way to page, Arizona.  I got miso ramen, it is a huge bowl, but somehow the brother for shoyu and miso seemed like the same."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've tried it several times and each visit was amazing!  Being in Henderson and close to my house, it's a huge plus for me.  I'm a fan of authentic ramen noodles but I would have to drive to the other side of town just to get it.  This place is just like the other ramen houses and has a menu with a variety of noodle bowls, appetizers, a couple of non-noodle dishes, dessert and alcohol.  Simple but delicious!!  The prices are decent and what I would expect for real ramen noodles.  The ambience is modern and casual.  The staff is wonderful!!!  Will keep coming back especially when the weather is cooler!!"}
{"text":"Ramen house in Henderson?! Highly recommend. I had the shrimp tempura ramen and chicken egg rolls. The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We love Ohjah Noodle House. We  dine there frequently and have always had excellent service. The food is yummy and the restaurant is spotless!"}
{"text":"So excited to have this in the neighborhood. I stopped in for lunch today with two friends. The Ramen was great. We tried 3 different ones, 2 of them with ox tail. The soups were savory, and the meat juicy and tender. Wonderful Genmaicha Green tea brewed in the teapot on the table. We also tried several appetizers, the garlic edamame was awesome (and spicy). This is about to become a \"several times a week\" stop for us. Welcome to the Black Mountain neighborhood Ohjahi."}
{"text":"Finally there is a ramen place down the street from the house! And it is very good! I know we get tired driving all the way to China town so if you are ever in Henderson you definitely have to try this place out! Mmmmm ramen"}
{"text":"Little spot that has a cozy feel with modern decor. Single waiter holding the house and was polite and attentive. Full ramen menu with  add-ons but I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. I recommend to get this one to compare to other Ramen restaurants. The soup came briskly and was visually appealing. Tasted great anf especially the chasu had this great grill taste to it. The soup wasn't as milky as I liked, but great nevertheless. Great little spot for ramen."}
{"text":"The ramen is amazing, great service too. I would give 5 stars if the pickled eggs were better, that's my only compliant that the eggs had zero flavor, Monta has much better eggs. I hope you improve your eggs asap."}
{"text":"The food is decent but not mind blowing. Certainly doesn't make up for the bad management and customer service. The reason I am giving 1 star is the misleading advertising and coupons they published. We went here because of a coupon--we hadn't been and thought we'd try it out. I'll try to attach a picture of it to this review, but basically the whole page is advertising the noodle house, and it comes with three coupons on top, but in tiny print beneath two of them it says the coupon is only for the Ohjah steakhouse, whose address isn't even on the ad! How misleading! When we presented this to the servers they said that last time they allowed someone to use that coupon (for the steakhouse), the boss made them take it out of their tips. Then they pointed out I could use one of the ads for a smaller discount, but when I tried to use it they told me I could only use it if I paid cash. What? That info (cash only) is not even on the ad. The server, who was incredibly nice about it, tried to give me $5 of her own tips to make up the difference for the coupon, to make it right (kudos to her), but I don't want to steal tips from the server just because her boss won't honor the coupons he publishes. Sounds like a terrible person to work for, and just bad business in general. We will not be going back there and neither should you."}
{"text":"Really good ramen. I had the miso ramen with chili paste. Its close to home so we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went with the family for Father's Day, great time...great experience. Staff was friendly and took time to explain how to order and what they liked. Food recommended was tasty and plentiful. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the day. Would recommend. (P.S. you can order different Ramen such as vegetable ramen which is not on the menu.)"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try a new noodle house after already having a favorite downtown noodle house but this new Henderson location is convenient.  The noodles are $8-$11 and the broth is excellent.  I do prefer noodle locations with the ability to add ginger and sesame seeds at the table.  I also wish this location offered kimchi. The chicken eggrolls are small but very good.  The seating is not crowded with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great ramen place without having to leave my little corner of Henderson.  The broth is very flavorful and the service was spot on.  Nice choice of appetizers and sake.  We went at 1700 on a Friday and were seated immediately.  The place was filling up as we were leaving.  I will be going back often."}
{"text":"Food is good.  The portion is large.  The services from the Asian gentleman is great.  

If you happened to be served by an Asian lady.  She is awful.  She refused to bring my family water until we ordered something.   We saw other customers came in and she had water ready."}
{"text":"I was never a ramen fan bc I never tried the stuff,  so I decided to give this place a shot and since then I have been back multiple times. I literally crave this at least 2 to 3 times a week. The food taste amazing , I always get the beef ramen. The staff and service are great. The manager Eric is extremely nice and very hospitable. If you love ramen come try this hidden gem out I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So funny, just wanted to share this. Just called in and placed my pickup order. Tonkatsu Ramen. Then I asked for my additional toppings. The employee on the other end said \"Shirley?\" Yeah it's me!...Love that the staff here knows their customers. Then again I'm pretty predictable. But every friend or neighbor I've sent here, always hear good feedback. Can't go wrong with the Ohjah brand!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful, kind of small which is ok, food was great! My picky kids also tried new dishes and loved them!"}
{"text":"Very good and very good service. I came with my family and the server with short hair was very personable. Their Shoyu ramen was a favorite for the night. My aunt had the chicken ramen and it was also really good. They gave a really good portion of chicken which was nice. Worth the money. Each bowl of ramen was roughly $10. I will defined return."}
{"text":"Tired of spendy casino food?  Need some fantastic ramen?  Look no further than Ohjah in Henderson. Returning from Arizona, we stopped here. It was great. Wonderful portions, great ramen and friendly service. Well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I always make the 30 minute drive to come here on days that I'm craving ramen and every time, it's been great! It's close to one of my school locations too so on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I come here for lunch after class with my friends. It's usually pretty empty which is nice because the workers are focused on you and you get what you need right away."}
{"text":"I've been trying to drag my girlfriend here since this place opened. We love Ramen and trying new places. These people put a lot of effort into this place. The food was outstanding, the tea revived me from my fever, and the service is like no other. Drag your spouse here if you want to try something new. We will definitely be regulars here in the future."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write  my review! Hands down one of our favorite date night dinner spots! Everything we have tried has been amazing! The bowls are HUGE, so be prepared! The house fried rice is a MUST! So happy to have a ramen place so close to home!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Ramen I have had!

Everything is totally bland! Out of 3 bowls ordered, not one had good flavor to any of us."}
{"text":"It was amazing, food was great, the people are awesome!!! I also love that we don't have to go so far to get roman now!! All around wonderful!!"}
{"text":"We were passing by, and we decided to try the ramen. The food and the service were amazing!! Even the restroom was perfect. Love it! Wish you all the best. If we come back to Las Vegas we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Serving size was perfect! Soup isn't as thick like some places (Monta) but it's good! Service was awesome, very friendly. I will be coming back !"}
{"text":"The place is very pleasant, clean and well kept. Our hostess, Fergie is very friendly, attentive and accommodating. She made sure that our drinks are topped off and very constantly checked up on us making sure that we are comfortable. She's a great hostess! 
The food, from a scale of good, better, and best great, is better. In the medium scale. It is not the greatest but it is not the worst either. We have dined in noodle houses that brought out amazing Ramen soups & due to the amazing Yelp reviews, our expectations were really high. 
The fried rice is on the salty side and the ginger taste to it is very obvious. It is not a hint but it is strong. The house noodles is good. The vegetables are cooked just right and the flavor is prepared just right. 
The Ohjah ramen soup is not the best I have tasted but it is not the worst either. The meat is cooked very well. It is soft and easy to chew. 
Needless to say, it is not my go-to ramen restaurant but I am not ruling it out of my as well. 
Everyone enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great noodle house, it was so good, the noodles and shrimp was amazing! I will definitely come back with my husband again!!"}
{"text":"Best noodle house I've been too. Now i know how Naruto felt on those cold nights with a belly full Miso Ramen!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a work conference and was under the weather. Decided ramen sounded like a good idea and came here. Great place!  Looks like it's a newer place and they deserve your business.  I got the house ramen and that was a great value as well as flavor. Great staff, nice place."}
{"text":"I believe this will be a new favorite.  The only menu item I have tried is the salmon which is served with miso and a lightly dressed slaw.  Hot tea which has a pleasing toasted taste and the pot stays warm.

This fits my food selection to an excellent!  The food is tasty and presentation is pleasant.  Good Service.  I plan on tasting other menu items maybe I will become a fan of other items."}
{"text":"We dropped into this place on our way back from the Hoover Dam.  It was our first experience with Ramen outside of the 10 for a buck grocery store packages.  We didn't know quite what to expect.... and were blown away.

The service was excellent, and the food better.  We had three appetizers - garlic edamame, egg rolls, and garlic fried noodles (which may have been a side dish).  All were great!  And then there was the ramen!  The chasu was beautifully cooked with exquisitely rendered fat, the eggs were luscious, and the soup was off the charts good.

The check was very reasonable.

Next time we're back in the area, Ohjah is on our short list of places we want to go back to!"}
{"text":"Eaahhhhaa? Its ok. Sadly I love Ohjah by Blue Diamond- the food there has always been on point. Today had high hopes for this. Very band and I think prepared WAY TOO FAST- makes me feel its all premade and just rushed out. We were seated ordered and left in 15 mins. I wouldn't say it was bad but just not up to the same standards of what I have become to love so much at the other location. Felt cold and not as welcoming. Cooks were on cell phones wearing gloves and making food. Over all it was clean. People were all severed and seated fast. Maybe a second try one day?! Maybe its the day? Food looked a million times better then the flavors it had (or lack of) I have never felt like I should add salt or seasoning to ramen- today I wish I had"}
{"text":"YUMMY! This ramen joint is the closest to us and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Ohjah Ramen because it included oxtail! The oxtail is extremely tender. The chasu can be a little fatty but I don't see anything wrong with that. Their broth is so flavorful (not too salty like other eateries) and their soft boiled egg is complete perfection!! I love that their ramen bowls come with the basics included, whereas other other ramen places you have to pay for every little add on. I order a side of noodles for my toddler and it's more than enough than him - AND it only costs 1.50! Very clean, super nice and accommodating staff. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"We checked out this new ramen shop that our friend found. It's a great new addition to the area as there aren't many great Ramen places in Henderson.  

The prices were standard for places like these with ramen bowls ranging from $8-12. Add ons are about $2 each. I was pleasantly surprised with the portion sizes. Definitely felt like a good value. 

The presentation was fun as well - from the drink glasses to the ramen bowls. The ramen spoon felt right and shared plates very Japanese as well. 

Would definitely come again. A nice friends & family atmosphere or a casual date spot."}
{"text":"I've had a couple other noodle houses in the Vegas area and this is my new favorite! Service was exceptional and prompt! Very clean and well decorated. Menu items explained well. Squid skewers and seaweed salad best I ever had. Will definitely be back. We had a party of four and we all agreed on how much we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Happy to see this location finally open as I have always been a big fan of OHJAH.

The Decor of this location is very traditional and warming, I ordered the Beef special ramen at medium spicy and added corn as a topping and it came out delicious, I also had garlic edamame for an appetizer and for me it was a perfect combination with the soup.

Staff was friendly, I will definitely try again and would recommend to others as well.  I gave 4 stars because the beef I had was a tad fatty and I didn't eat it all but will reevaluate on my next visit


Updated to 5 stars I have since been back two times and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is legit, cultured with great food and amazing service. I have to eat a specific diet and the server didn't hesitate to accommodate my needs. Thank you for putting such a great restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was struggling to decide whether to give this place a 3 or a 4 star review but settled on a 4 star but keep in mind it's closer to like a 3.7.  I really like the design and decor of the place.  It is very inviting and comforting.  The staff are very kind and attentive and joke around with you if you make jokes.  I must say though, the food was not bad, it just wasn't on the same level as Ramen Sora, like not even close unfortunately.  I got the house fried noodle and the Shoyu Ramen.  The noodle was okay but there really wasn't anything special about it.  I will say that I did like the little ginger kick that was in there.  The ramen was just okay as well and I think that comes down to the broth.  While the chashu was really flavorful and the noodles had a really good bite to them, the broth itself was lacking a lot of flavor and complexity, almost as if it had been watered down.  Like I said before, it wasn't bad, it was just lacking something.  Maybe it didn't have enough salt in it, or umami?  I don't know honestly.  It did have heat which was nice but that's all it was was heat, it didn't add much chili flavor to the broth.  I was very pleased to see that along with melon cream soda, they also have mango cream soda which I hadn't tried yet.  It was good and you should get either one and enjoy it with your meal!

I thought I was alone and was at first afraid to share my opinion with my friends but they both agreed.  They each got the Miso Ramen.  They said that their broth was also on the bland side.  They did however say that their appetizers, the chicken egg rolls and the gyoza were pretty good.

I would come back to this place because it is really close to my house and there are a lot of other options on their menu that I would like to try but when I am really on a ramen kick and need to get my fix, this is not the place I will find it."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and at an actual ramen noodle house. I would 10/10 come back again and seek out their other locations if I happen to be close to one. The menu was easy to navigate and customizing your ramen is not an issue either. Their Mango cheesecake was exceptional and would highly recommend to anyone looking to try a dessert that is not mochi!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the best ramen house I've been to. They gave classy, relaxing music playing, it's a low lit, gorgeous atmosphere, and the staff is so friendly and respectful! I've never had ramen that tasted so good in my life."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have to try new things. Ohjah was one of those things and I couldn't have been happier. Service was outstanding. Our hostess answered all questions and helped explain the food very well, our busser never let our cups get empty or table stay filled with dirty dishes. The food was equally as amazing. We had never had ramen before so we chose the less \"adventurous\" miso ramen. The chashu was absolutely amazing. It was so juicy and soft. My husband got a spicy broth and I got a mild. They had very different flavors but we're both very good. I have zero complaints about my experience and can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Had the oxtail ramen and it was delicious! Staff were friendly and service was good too! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Ramen place. I had the Tonkatsu Ramen and it was very flavorful. I'm giving it four stars because I went with a friend and she had the house noodles and to our surprise those were sweet, no bueno. The sauce in the noodles has lots of ketchup and it does not marry well with the seafood. Other than that the service was great! Will definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"First trip and it definitely won't be my last. Super friendly service and the new restaurant is a welcome change for the neighborhood. I had a serious hankering for some noodles and the dish I had tonight hit the spot: the house noodles. Simple, hot and delicious. I can't wait to come back with my wife so we can try the ramen."}
{"text":"I can easily say this food is OUTSTANDING!  Best noodle pho ever!  Blows away all i have had in Seattle!  Noodles taste fresh and homemade.  I had the house special with oxtail, pork and beef."}
{"text":"Had the beef ramen  very good, everyone that in our party enjoyed their dish!! Price wss not expensive."}
{"text":"This was a nice little find! The shoyu ramen hd great flavor and was not too salty. The staff was perfect! They didn't check up on me too often, but they did appear whenever my iced tea was running low (for which I was thankful as it was about 112 outside). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive for Ramen noodles, they had a layer of oil or grease on the top. I paid $23 for 2 noodle bowls. It was just noodle...no meat or anything. The place looked clean and decorated nicely, but that's probably the last time I'll see it."}
{"text":"Had a 4th of July dinner with my wife here this year.  Very quaint setting.  Service was good (although my wife never got her hot water as requested).  Soups were favorable and filling.  Pricing is reasonable and I will return for a second at it."}
{"text":"I consider myself a ramen aficionado and have tried just about every place across the valley.  Much to my pleasure, this place is about two miles from my house and I've now been three times.  Each time I tried a different ramen base and am very happy to report they were all delicious.  The prices are average, but the quality is high.  The restaurant and kitchen appeared very clean.  The service was prompt and courteous.  All in all I love this place and look forward to becoming even more of a regular!"}
{"text":"One word EXCELLENT. Food is so delicious. Professional service. For sure I will come back"}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner last night and ordered the garlic edamame, tan tan men and tonkotsu ramen, both with udon noodles substituted for the ramen noodles. 

The food came out quickly and tasted amazing. The tan tan men has a thicker, more meaty broth than the tonkotsu but both were equally amazing. We weren't sure how spicy we wanted our ramens so we requested a side of chili paste to add spice as needed, which the server happily brought out with our ramen.

The restaurant itself was very clean and the service was excellent. We especially enjoyed the music selection; the top 40 selection made for a lively atmosphere without being overly loud so we could will enjoy our conversation. We will definitely we returning here!"}
{"text":"A last minute lunch for a party of seven was not a problem for this quaint noodle house with a mere 15 minutes wait for a large table. Our waitress was on top of her game when it came to drink orders and repeating back what each of us chose off the menu. The menu has the perfect amount of options and the descriptions of all the ingredients which made it easy for the grandparents to make decisions without feeling overwhelmed since they were the only ones who had not yet experienced ramen noodles. The atmosphere is bright, music is good and the food is great! We will definitely be driving across town again to enjoy this little hole-in-the-wall gem. BTW, if we could have found a way to sneak the solid wood table located in the middle of the restaurant out with us,we would have. It's just amazing! Thank you for a most enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Tasty and reasonable price. We stopped by when we drove back from Hoover dam. Very close to the highway."}
{"text":"Love this place ! We always go to China Town for authentic Ramen. It's a bit of a drive & the wait sometimes is absolutely horrible! Checked out this gem! It is super cute & clean in the inside. We were seated right away. Ordered a chicken miso Ramen. Was avoiding any beef etc so it was sort of my attempt at healthy so while the pic might not look so good, I assure you it was amazing. I loved it. The waitress was really sweet as well. I will definitely be back again. Added plus, it was open regular hours on Labor Day!"}
{"text":"We came here otw back from Grand Canyon. Hubby wanted some thing in Henderson so we stopped by to try Ohjah Ramen. I had Miso Ramen, hubby had Beef Ramen and kids had Chicken Fried Rice with no veggies. Hubby said Beef Ramen is good, broth not greasy and beef is very tender. Kids (5yo and 8yo) said the Chicken Fried Rice is good. Miso Ramen was good as well. Broth not too salty and pork not too fatty. Overall was a win for us. Thanks Ohjah!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some noodles but the place we used to go to closed down. Saw this place on the trusty yelp and decided to give it a try. Nice place, small, clean, cozy. The ramen portions were huge, but the flavor was...meh. we ordered the tako yaki because I've always wanted to try it and I couldn't get past one bite. I have nothing to compare it to so I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but it was almost liquid in the middle. Like raw dough. And it tasted of old grease. The ramen itself was ok, but it's not something I would go out of my way for. I think I'll keep looking to find my new ramen spot. Service was great though."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place a couple of weeks ago. The staff were nice, the place look clean and it's not too crampy which I love because I have 2 little children and it's close to my home. Yay! Finally a ramen place open up near my house. When we were seated we saw another group of our friends. The food came and I liked the broth but the noodle wasn't cooked. I could taste the flour and it was mushy. It looked like an uncooked wet flour noodle. My friend and I like ramen but that day she couldn't finish her food. Our other friends at the other table said their food was excellent. Their noodles was perfect. And another friend of ours went on a different day and they said theirs was delicious! Because of this I'm willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Great place for ramen noodles, the fiancé and I came here craving noodles. We decided to get the beef ramen, & vegetable egg rolls. The egg rolls were so fresh and not greasy yet very tasty. The beef ramen was great I highly recommend this place service is great and fast you will not be disappointed. Beef ramen is $8.75 & egg rolls about $3.25 for two. If you're craving ramen I recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"After a long Day and nursing the end of a cold, a big bowl of broth and noodles sounded amazing. It wasn't good. I wanted it to be good! It really wasn't. I had a noodle soup with wontons, my husband had one with dumplings. I joked that they might taste identical, and I was right! The broth was salty and bland. The noodles were oddly tough and even though I can usually enjoy any noodle out in front of me, these were so bad that I stopped eating. I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the young ladies who helped us were friendly and efficient. 
Man, I really wish it had been better."}
{"text":"First time here, had the ohjah special, my wife had the tonkotsu they were both great! The waiters were friendly with smiles on their faces, it was a nice cozy place, we will be back."}
{"text":"Who would've known there was a good ramen place in this part of Henderson, Nevada?  The seating area was clean and the decor is simple but nice.  I got there around 6:15pm on a Tuesday and just beat the rush.  Within a few minutes there was a line out the door!

The menu had plenty to choose from.  I tried both the Yaki Gyoza and the Shrimp Skewers.  Both were good.  I also opted for the Tonkatsu ramen.  The pork belly was wonderful - cooked down to roughly a 1/4\" thick, with a nice tasty layer of fat.  This was definitely my favorite part of the meal.  The broth was good but could have used a little something more.

All in all, I would recommend them.  The prices are very reasonable, and he food was good!"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Ramen house and this one is by far one of the best. Their House Fried Rice is the bomb.com and their Oxtail Ramen is on point. The Gyoza is pretty good and chicken wings are good with the dipping sauce. the chicken Katsu is amazingly good and comes with ALOT of food. I am totally coming back. Plus the waiters are all so nice!"}
{"text":"My family and I had been looking forward to some authentic Japanese ramen, let me tell you I was sooo excited! We've resided in Japan for several years and hadn't ventured out and tried any in over a year. Unfortunately this trip was a complete and total let down. Typically when you enter a Japan restaurant, you will hear \"Irrashaimase\" which is basically a welcoming formality, didn't get that. We sat ourselves which can also be common in Japanese ramen spots. We waited and waited ohh and waited for someone to come and inquire what drinks we preferred. Meanwhile, a group of four that had come in about 6 minutes after us, had already received their drinks. Once the waitress finally made it over to our table, I expressed my concerns, to no avail. So after the complete and total lack of customer service, we decided to leave, we didn't even bother to order. I was so excited, but was quickly let down. Overall, we just didn't feel welcomed. Won't return to this establishment. But I am still on the hunt for some amazing Ramen, with great customer service."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Ramen. Being in the Henderson area does limit you to the choices you have as where you can get a good bowl of Ramen. I was very excited when they opened this location. I've been wanting to try it for a while now and finally got a chance to last week.

We arrived here about an hour before closing. We were greeted by our waitress and sat down. The space is very quaint and has a very modern feel to it. We love the decor and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.

The menu is quite simple. Not like some of the other prominent places in Las Vegas. About nine or 10 varieties of Ramen to choose from along with some traditional appetizers like edamame and gyoza.

My friend went ahead and asked if they had some kind of vegetable Ramen that was not on the menu. She was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did have a Ramen that was not on the menu that was vegetarian. A soy-based soup with mushrooms and other fresh vegetables. She gave it a steady 4/5. The Ramen noodle themselves were pretty decent. I've had better. Jinya always seems to have a great noodle but this place was pretty good.

I went ahead and had the shrimp Ramen. I added two eggs and the garlic butter. Prices for the add-ons are a average. It's always a pisser when you have to add things to your Ramen that shit traditionally come with it just so that they can make a quick dollar but this place was pretty decent with the price and the price of the add-ons.

The broth was pretty tasty. Noodles the same. The Ramen came with five shrimp. Wasn't sure but they tasted like they were frozen. Not bad at all. Eggs were prepared perfectly. A soft boil. I gave it a 4/5. 

Traditional condiments. Sou sauce with chili oil and chili flakes.

The staff was very friendly and very eager to help. Definitely overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I had the Tan Tan Men and it was exceptional. It was not spicy as advertised but it was still exceptional. #RainyDayHusband"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, and the friendliest staff.  Defiantly coming back soon. I highly recommend the ohjah house special ramen and the garlic edamame is addicting..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Cool little restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Small but doesn't feel cramped. Excellent ramen. I got one of the pork ramens and ordered extra pork. The pork is pork belly so has delicious fat on it. Also started with the shrimp skewer. Again, superb. My friend ordered some kimchi fried rice which was good. Be sure to order extra egg, meat, spinach or whatever else you like. Also, go easy on their peppers. It's really spicy hot. The broth usually is pretty spicy anyway. Worth the drive if you're in Henderson."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, clean and they have friendly staff. Tried the house fried rice and their popular Ohjah Ramen. Fried rice has a weird twist to it. Too salty for my taste and weird. Perhaps I'm just used to chinese version of fried rice. The ramen broth and noodles are good . But nothing really special about it. For me overall it's a meh. I had something way better. The only plus is it's close to home. But is it worth the trip? Nah. I'll probably just put cup a noodle on my microwave add some veggies, seaweed and eggs and be jst equally happy and yes I will be able to save my $25 too. Just my own opinion. But it's worth the try in support of our local businesses."}
{"text":"Finally, a really legit Ramen house in the part of Henderson that we live in! Thank you! We didn't mind having to drive to Spring Mountain, (Little Asia) or near the strip for decent Ramen but this is great! Just another sign that Henderson is building up and more quality food places will keep popping up.

Been here three times already and have not been disappointed at all. I have had the ox tail and Miso Ramen dishes. I felt the Miso was the better of the two. Looking forward to going back and trying the chicken karage. Want to see how comparable it is to Hashi and Izikaya Go. There's is phenomenal. 

If you want decent ramen in Hendo and not want to go too far to get it. This would be it, but if you want really good ramen then yeah... The places to go are definitely off Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with ramen before at a previous restaurant but this place definitely made me love ramen so much now. Great service, they accommodated well to my family and I, and they make every experience great"}
{"text":"I have a new spot for ramen! The noodles taste so good.. I ordered the miso ramen for my 1st try and chashu pork topping was on point aside from the perfect tasting soup and egg cooked perfectly.. I wanna try the tonkatsu ramen next. 
We also ordered takoyaki which has to be cooked some more coz the batter inside was still too wet. Fried oysters were OK.."}
{"text":"It's 5 stars all around - ramen is comparable to Monta Ramen, but better because it has Ox Tail too... so delicious.  Service is top notch...  Eric is fast, courteous and fun. We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The atmosphere is welcoming. The food is amazing! We ordered the pork katsu, fried house noodles, egg rolls and goyoza. All of it was just delicious! I would recommend the house noodles and egg rolls to everyone. The chocolate mochi is so yummy!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth time eating there but my parents have been frequently eating there for sometime... a couple dishes are my favorite but the Tasty Cream sodas I really enjoy each time I come..."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian Ramen! Fresh and full of flavor. First time, but I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Decent Ramen place. The menu is small but has all the necessities of a good ramen eatery. I love the portions of the cuts of chashu and the fact that nitamago is already included in their ramen and not just an add-on. I just wish there were more appetizers to choose from. Overall, it was a pleasant experience with nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional. We had the miso, egg rolls, and fried shrimp. They were fast friendly and the food was excellent, it was very authentic, and fresh. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Finally a ramen house on this side of Henderson. This is my new fav so delicious and service is great"}
{"text":"Good food! Fast delivery ( almost to fast)!! Service was not bad. 

Hard to read menu really small print!

We will be back for more"}
{"text":"Very cute place with a rustic Asian decor. Kinda small but they seemed to accommodate guests pretty quickly for a Saturday night 7:30ish. We went in a few days earlier to grab a menu and already knew what we wanted. We were handed a different menu so what we wanted wasn't on the \"in house\" menu. (Found out as we were leaving that the to go menu is the new menu, so make sure you grab that one upon entering, more selections). 

We ordered garlic edamame which was absolutely delicious. We also ordered house friend rice, had meat in it and it didn't state that on menu, I don't eat me so I just picked it out. Hubby ordered shrimp ramen and I asked for a veggie. I enjoyed mine very much. Broth is out of the world delicious. Had to master the chopsticks because no forks were offered. I knew that staff was busy so I didn't want to be a pain. Overall we really enjoyed the food but wish they gave you a little more info on ordering. Guess we will get to know it better because we will definitely go back. Only 4 stars because we felt a little lost in there. May upgrade rating next time."}
{"text":"So yum:
I recommend, see you guys soon.
Thanks for the good costumer service, everything was delicious ."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen here. Their fried rice is great and got to have the garlic edamame. Its a small place, but so far has never been too busy. Service is great."}
{"text":"First off, I love ramen both pre-packed and freshly prepared, and I l've dined at quite a few noodle houses before. I like to consider myself pretty experienced with my favorite dish.

This place, hands down, has blown me away.

The broth, noodles, flavors, and ingredients are all top-notch and way above expectations. My girlfriend and I ordered Shoyu & Miso ramen respectively, and we are speechless. It was incredible.

Along with our order we also got House Fried Rice (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and Takoyaki. The rice arrived at least 5 minutes after we ordered and was fantastic. The ramen not even 5 more after, along with our Takoyaki.

Overall, a wonderful dining experience with friendly, very attentive staff that greets you with smile. Even the cook came out to socialize and take our order! 

Highly, highly recommend this place!

Tip: grab a chilled Melon Cream Soda, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"This was a quick stop after a haircut. It was delicious. Service was super fast and attentive. I'm in love with ramen more now than I have been in the past. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. A friend at the hospital come here for lunch regularly,she raves about the prices and quality of service. I wasn't thrilled about the location but that can be easily forgiven because the food is great."}
{"text":"Delicious. Service was prompt. All employees seem to be happy to be there and genuinely want to help. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all we were greeted with warm friendly smiles. The place was spotless. We ordered the ground pork Ramen and omg. I never thought it would compare to those many Ramen houses in LA but Jesus, it far surpassed any of them. We ordered a side of chicken fried rice and that was beyond delicious. We voted it the best noodle house everrrrr!"}
{"text":"I had the tempura shrimp ramen and my wife had the miso ramen.  The broth was delicious, but the egg and the extra egg I ordered were both hard boiled.  My ramen was also missing the bamboo, and had wood fungus added- which is not a favorite of mine.  Service was fine.  Restaurant is very wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"This is the first place I have ever had authentic ramen. Not the stuff you ate in college! I've had the Miso Ramen and the Beef Ramen and they are both awesome. You can also customize your order to add extra awesomeness. The staff are polite, the service is quick and it is my favorite place to get my ramen fix. I'm eating a bowl of Beef Ramen as I type, at home, because they do takeout, booyah! (Some assembly required for takeout)"}
{"text":"Ramen was very delicious! The staff has been very friendly and considerate, they have made us feel very important and I've never been served ramen that fast! 

I will definitely come back! It's nice to have a good ramen house in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a bowl of Ramen on a cold winter day. Nothing. I dare you to come up with something better! I dare you!!! Tell me something better that isn't Ramen and we'll schedule a time and place then I'll come fight you.

Anyhow on this particular day, my girl and I just came back from a treacherous hike at the Gold Strike Hot Springs where we had lounged in some outdoor hot springy goodness.

Ever gone out in super cold weather then get into a nice hot tub? Now imagine soaking it up in the hot geothermal water juxtaposed against the cold winter air touching your exposed skin.......pretty amazing, am I right? Now imagine doing all that and getting Ramen afterwards! Shao-ragious! Non? ..........We'll give it a try before you die.

Anyhow Ohjah Noodle House #2 at the time we went (just before 5pm) was kinda empty except for three other couples/groups. We were seated promptly and overall the place was clean. Menu is pretty straightforward and also had pictures which is good because I can't read.

My girl ordered the Shoyu Ramen and I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with two extra pieces of chatsu and kaidama! What's kaidama you ask? Well it's Swahili for extra noodle s'il vous plait. (I had worked up quite an appetite and was hankering for alot of food)

How did everything taste?

Shoyu Ramen - Noodles were a little larger and the broth was more light. Not my preference, but my girl liked it. Bowl had a good balance of flavors and not too salty.

Tonkotsu Ramen with extra chashu and KAIDAMA!!! - This bowl was very tasty. The broth was nice and hearty. The noodles were thinner than the Shoyu option and the chashu was succulent. Only one gripe I had was that the extra noodles were sitting in a side bowl since adding it to the main bowl would've created a noodle overflow situation. So the main bowl was awesome, delicious, perfecto! However, when I eventually depleted those noodles and dumped in the Kaidama (extra noodles) the broth had cooled.  As I started eating the second helping of noodles they didn't taste as good since they didn't marinate in the broth for as long. My recommendation would be if you order the extra noodle option see if they'll include some extra extra hot broth on the side for the noodles to marinate in. Or just forgo the extra noodles completely, don't be a greedy eating machine, and just enjoy the bowl as the Ramen Gods intended - a singular entity.

Yeah, so not my first choice for Ramen shops out in Vegas, but it was on the way and accessible. Worth a look if you're in the area.

P.S. I'm not sure I used juxtaposed right or even that I know its actual definition, but I wanted to sound smart. Damn! Why didn't I pay attention in the Princeton Review SAT prep?!"}
{"text":"Great place for Ramen. Service was great as well. They explain well what different type of Ramen they have and all the different combinations that can be made. Chicken egg rolls are very good as well."}
{"text":"Kevin was very helpful and knowledgeable. I had miso raman which I very much enjoyed. We had a great morning at the Clark County Museum and were looking for a lunch option on our way back to Las Vegas. We'll definitely make the drive to Henderson on our next visit"}
{"text":"Love this place, I take my mother all the time. Staff is very friendly and service is fast. Food presentation is nice."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful but the food was absolutely Ah-mazing.  I took my 5 &11 year old sons, they loved it too."}
{"text":"Lunch at Ohjah Noodle house Henderson. I ordered miso ramen with mild spicy. That was great. I love the delicious combination of tasty warm broth. Ohjah Noodle has chicken and pork broth, you can pick the one you like. I picked the pork broth this time, the tasty of the broth was real rich. Also the pork meat (Sha Chu) was really tender. Fresh veggie comes along with the Japanese fresh noodle. ALL in one bowl. I usually go to the other Noodle house located at Durango a lot, this is my first time eating Henderson location, it's surprised me that different staffs here but same quality of ramen and great service. Good Job, Ohjah.:)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service, and large portions.  This is one of the best bowls i have ever had!"}
{"text":"What a little treasure for ramen in Henderson. Do not let the location fool you, it is located in the Von's shopping center. I wanted to pamper myself but I was also on a deadline, I saw noodles and made a beeline to park. I expected a nondescript interior, and when I walked in the door I felt like I could be on the Strip. The decor is warm tones and a wood floor, sconces and hanging lamps with sleek tables and chairs. 

The server Jonai was as sweet as could be, she asked me if I had questions and I wanted the Shoyu Ramen. I am no ramen expert but it is my base now of what I like. I was trying to decide on a tea and she knew what was caffeinated and what was not. The ramen was so delicious, and there is nothing like pork melting onto you palate. The broth was very flavorful. 

So, when you are in Henderson, stop by for an urban atmosphere, great ramen, and great service!"}
{"text":"I came here alone, craving more so for some takoyaki than some ramen. This place is great for groups--very chill and casual for a nice lunch break. It wasn't busy at the time I came (around noon), but I can imagine business picking up if word is going around about this place. The staff was incredibly friendly and explained their menu briefly since I said that it was my first time there. I really appreciated that little bit of friendliness and time to make sure I was comfortable with what I was ordering!

First off, the takoyaki was delicious. I'm a huge fan of octopus and these appetizers were perfect. I definitely burned my tongue trying to down them all in a few minutes, but it was worth it. I made a mess with all the bonito flakes sprinkled on top, though, haha.

As for ramen, I got the Ohjah special. Great broth, great amount of toppings. No complaints at all except for the fact that I looked like an idiot trying to go to town on the oxtail! It's not the easiest to eat with chopsticks because of how bony it is, but at least it tasted good. I think I might shy away from oxtail when I come back and opt for something more basic, like the ramen with just the pork.

Really glad I tried this place out. Friendly staff and good food make for a place that makes me want to return!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!!! Great Service! Delicious food! Impressed about everything! Thanks to the Manager Eric!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Yuuuum! This place is so bomb. Can't believe it took us 5 months living down the street to try it. We had a beef ramen and vegetable ramen and both were so fresh and delicious flavors. The chili paste was made fresh in house! So good but pretty spicy so start with a little and you can always add more. The ramen noodles were spectacular guys. This place is absolutely wonderful and especially if your hungover (just a lil tip). Your welcome! :) give this place a go."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good portion size, not too small or too big with reasonable prices which makes for me regularly returning. They have some non-noodle dish items but most items are ramen."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with some friends since I saw a bunch of positive 4-5 star reviews and this place is closeby. 

I ordered the oxtail ramen with the house special fried rice. The ramen itself was okay, nothing special. The broth itself didn't have as strong a flavor to it compared to other places I have been to (Fukumimi, Sora. and even Monta LOL). The meat itself wasn't as tender as I'd expect oxtail to be, but at least it wasn't super chewy and tough. I also feel like they don't give you much meat compared to the amount of noodles you get. I think I only got 2 small pieces of oxtail meat attached to the bone. The fried rice was okay. For the amount of oil it had, I thought it would at least be packed with some flavor. I don't think there was any meat in it either...or if there was then they really skimped out on it haha. Service was decent. The staff was very attentive, but I don't think they really communicate with each other. One person would come and take our order or do something and then another person would come and ask for the same thing lol. 

Overall, it's nice that a place like this opened up nearby. I might drop by again and try some of their other dishes and hopefully they will be better. It's worth checking out if you want some Japanese food, but are to lazy to drive far lol."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Their ramen rivals Monta Chaya which is now closed down.  I'm so happy I found out about this place."}
{"text":"Ohjah Noodle House really is a great place for lunch!  It was a wonderful experience, right down to the tea! The octopus appetizer was a hit, as was the shrimp ramen (my friend had the tempura shrimp). YUM!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars is more like it...Service was friendly, the ramen was decent.

We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen w extra chashu and the Ohjah Ramen and though they were good, I still prefer Monta's ramen.  The ramen here is just missing something...just not as flavorful, but still decent for where it is located.  This noodle house seats way more folks than Monta though.  Service was friendly...we got in, and got out with our noodle fix."}
{"text":"Best ramen restaurant I ever been to. Great service. Excellent food. The flavors are right on. Oysters were excellent as well as the chicken egg rolls. The shrimp fried rice had a really good taste. Very different from Chinese fried rice. The ramen noodles were awesome. Great tasting broth. Noodles had great texture. Service again was awesome. Great atmosphere. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to eat great ramen noodles."}
{"text":"This is my go to ramen place. We always order the Ohjah Ramen, and we just keep coming back for it. Yes it is really good!"}
{"text":"Great food good service im glad they opened 1 Up here in henderson , Will be coming back."}
{"text":"So glad this ramen shop finally opened here. It did not disappoint! Squid skewer and gyoza cooked the way I like it. Tan tan ramen was a very mild spicy. Shoyu ramen with chashu was delicious. Staff was very attentive. My daughters have found a new favorite ramen shop!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly service and food order arrived quick and fresh n tasty ramen xo tail and ramen mince pork was yummies..."}
{"text":"Upscale design, medium priced menu. A local Ramen Noodle House for Henderson.

A stained wood based mid century feel. Brown, dark red accents with beehive like hanging pendants. A dose of trance music in the background.... 

Ordered Chicken Ramen as a basic safe meal... Chop Sticks, Iapanese Soup Spoon with tall glassware. Sapporo Beer is one of the 6 beer selections along with four wine choices.

As you can see in the photo of Chicken Ramen, the portion is semi large. Nice presentation. Tasty. Less broth than I thought but nice tasting.

Staff is quick, courteous dressed in black slacks and pull over. Runner is wearing same with white pullover.

Overall this was a terrific find. A simple google search."}
{"text":"Our favorite place  love the people and the food, never disappoints you and their house tea and mango cheesecake are the best"}
{"text":"I had the Shoyu Ramen with garlic butter and added corn also. It was sooooo good and has a strong porky broth. I also ordered the house fried noodles and wasn't really liking the sweet taste of it. Other than that, I plan to try every thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and gorgeous! I've never been to a place where the food served looks just as good as it is on the menu. The employees are so sweet and thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Great ramen place! I had the Miso Ramen, goyza, & house fried rice. So full!! Everything was yummy!"}
{"text":"The service was good but I didn't enjoy the ramen. It didn't have any flavor nor did it have the fish cake. I have since found other ramen places that I prefer. I would have given two stars but they get an extra for having red bean mochi ice cream!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great!  So happy to have a place like this near where I live."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Henderson, the manager Eric treats you like family. I recommend a visit to this place and leave time to enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Clean, relaxed atmosphere. Ordered oxtail noodle soup as carry out. While waiting, sweet wait staff brought me the most awesome glass of ice water I've ever had!! Perfect! Anyone who knows me, knows how i feel about clear ice. WoW. Impressive. The noodle soup was every bit as good as you would expect from a eatery that gets ice water right. Happy lady."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, great price 
I went with my boyfriend and sister because we love ramen. I'm so happy they have a noodle house by my house that's extremely yummy"}
{"text":"What do you want when you go to a restaurant? 

Good food and fast service, right ? 
Then hit Ohjah Noodle House uppppppppp. 
I've always had a great experience with them and their food is consistent in taste. 

I've tried a few of their broths and I like the oxtail and tonkatsu, their miso is really great as well. The oxtail that comes with your meal isn't just a few of meat, they really give you great quality and quantity which makes their prices very fair. 
I love their food and how hot their food comes out. I mean we all know they cook their food before it gets to you, but to get it steaming right out of the kitchen ... makes you feel some type of way! 
I liked the kimchi fried rice, wish it had more kimchi in it but it was delicious! You have to try the gyoza, because they're super delicious with any meal!

Honestly my heart is just so happy to finally have a good ramen place in Henderson! 
I'd highly recommend and I know I'll be a regular here in no time."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen at a good price which isn't too common in Henderson. Good selection of ramen and appetizers. Takoyaki was delicious as well as the miso ramen."}
{"text":"Great little noodle house where the food is tasty, the service is fast, and staff is super friendly. Portions are more than enough for one person - large enough for leftovers the next day. From the outside, you would never know this place is so welcoming inside. The decor and ambiance makes it a great spot for groups while intimate enough for a casual date night. A hidden gem in Henderson so close to home. We'll definitely be back and will recommend to family/friends."}
{"text":"Not only is it amazing to have a ramen place so close but it was absolutely delicious and the staff where all very nice and made sure we where taken care of. We will eat here all the time"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My mom and I went here for dinner on Friday and loved everything. The interior is so nice and calming and much nicer than you would think when you walk up. The staff was exceedingly friendly. The prices were perfect. But the best part really was the food. Pork belly that melted in your mouth. Perfectly cooked eggs. Amazing gyozas. There is a side of fresh diced chilis/peppers that they give you that is also divine. Come here and you won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Soooooo, we waited for this place to open and finally it is. My husband and I love ramen  and we were excited to see that one had finally opened close to our house. Tonight, we ordered miso ramen (spicy of course) and chahan (fried rice). We were very satisfied and we are pretty sure that we will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent House Beef, Shrimp Ramen!  Came in because of the 4 1/2 star rating. Loved it!  Will be back as often as possible! I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"We fell in love with this place after our first visit. The restaurant was clean and we were greeted immediately. There was no wait on a Monday night and it's a bit relief knowing that there's another Ramen place in Henderson aside from Monta that tastes delicious. Definitely coming back here often and with friends. It's bigger than Monta as well so hopefully it doesn't get as crowded. I hate those 30+ minute wait lines!"}
{"text":"A great Ramen House in a location I would have never expected in Henderson.  I just love surprises and I'm a fan of Ohjah Noodle House #2

Service:  A very friendly staff that gets you seated and your order in quickly.  The food comes out timely and the manager made a stop to check on the ramen and everything else.  Good stuff

Ramen & more:  I started off with the Takoyaki which is one of my favorite Japanese street foods.  Ohjah's was very good and I would definitely order it again.  I went with the Shoyu Ramen this visit and added extra Chahu because I usually feel extra with Ramen.  The broth was flavorful but a little on the saltier side, which I'm totally fine with.  The egg, fish cake, etc and everything else in the Ramen was great and complimented the ramen well.

Ambiance:  Lots of wooden tables, benchese and walls to give me that Ramen House feel I experienced during my Tokyo visit.  The difference being that Ohjah #2 has a lot more space with numerous booths and a long middle table to accommodate numerous parties of Ramen diners.

Ohjah Noodle House #2 is a much shorter drive than Spring Mountain from Green Valley if I'm fiending some high quality ramen.  Because of this, I can see more visits to Ohjah #2 in the near future.  I'm looking forward to trying other dishes as this visit was a pleasant surprise.  Until next time!  Enjoy yourself..."}
{"text":"My girl and I were very excited that a noodle house was opening just down the street from us! We waited for almost 2 months! We finally got to try it and we were not disappointed! The staff was very friendly when we walked in! Greeted by everyone. We ordered the Tako Wasabi and I had the House Ramen/ extra spicy. My girl had the Tam Tam I think (more focused on my food) . The Tako came out and we were a little put off because of the way it looked.... like goop in a glass dish... it tasted great but only for a bit. You'll get over the texture pretty fast. The Ramen came out and it was amazing! I finished the whole bowl! I'll be visiting frequently for sure! Good job Ohjah!"}
{"text":"Omg, where do i start? SERVICE, this place is the flippin' best you can ever ask for! Eric, the manager, is the absolute coolest, nicest, passionate, sincere man i've ever had the pleasure of encoutering! I had their spicy miso and added a side of garlic butter, which was to die for. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"So up to now my only knowledge of ramen was Nissin vs Maruchan. But tonight I've tried real ramen at the new Ohjah Noodle House #2. I don't think I can go back to the cheap prepackaged crap. Ever. 

I ordered Special Beef Ramen tonight. A big ol' bowl of noodle soup with 4 pieces of ultra tender beef (like pot roast), a boiled egg, bean sprouts, wood fungus (awesome) and a piece of nori. The broth is killer. Very light and loaded with green onion. Love it. Love it. Love it. This was a satisfying bowl of soup.

I ate tonight with chop sticks. Something I tend to do when they are available. I've gotten pretty good with them in my years. For a fork wielding lug like me, using chop sticks is oddly satisfying. And using them forces me to slow down and enjoy my food more. Double bonus.

I ordered dessert tonight too. Another first for me was the red bean mochi ice cream. I'm not exactly sure how to describe them. Cold. Chewy. Lightly sweet. Served with whipped cream and a cherry on top. A mochi sundae. Works for me. I would not hesitate to order it again. 

I would not hesitate to order anything from Ohjah. The food is great. Service is friendly down to the Japanese greeting when you walk through the door. And the food came out so quick. This is a must try place that I must try again. No doubt about that."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, the best noodle place I've ever been to!  The food is amazing as well as the service!  Make sure you try the Garlic Edamame!  It's the best I've ever had!  The Miso Raman is also amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was so happy when they built this place in my area because there isn't any good places to eat by my house.  I go to Ohjah at least twice a month with my family."}
{"text":"Wound up stopping here on the way home from visiting the Hoover Dam. My girlfriend had it bookmarked for some reason. Well, I wish we hadn't found this place in her bookmarks as the ramen was rather pedestrian. The family tried the miso, tan tan and beef oxtail ramen. The tan tan had a weird peanut flavor, the miso tasted watered down, and the beef was passable. We also ordered the karaage which tasted like card board. The best feature was oxtail which was actually quite tender and flavorful. The place was clean and the service prompt, but not enough of a difference maker to have me come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the house fried noodle and shrimp fried rice bowl.
The service is always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm actually not a huge fan of Japanese ramen. But this one changed my mind. Sooooo delicious. Savory so much flavor. I recommend adding the chili paste and adding the House chili sauce. I enjoyed the oxtail ramen, highly recommended. The bf got miso ramen also highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this Noodle House! Food is served hot and very tasty. Ramen portions are large and flavorful. We had Shrimp Swirl Pops, Spring Rolls, and Garlic Edamame as appetizers and all three were delicious! My husband's favorite ramen is Shoyu. I love the vegetable ramen. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!! Servers are great and very attentive. We enjoy it every time we visit! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!  The food looks just as great as the pictures.  The staff was very friendly.  Most plates were less than $10-very reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"Had the Miso soup and it was delicious with garlic butter and the staff here are friendly!"}
{"text":"It's... not bad. It gets a ton of points for location. Kobo or Jinya are ten times better quality, but they're also an extra 30 minute drive on this place.

I tried the Ohjah special on my first visit. The noodles were decent, but the beef flavor in the broth was just absurdly over powering. If this place was farther away, I would not give it a second chance.

I had the tan tan for this visit. It had a fire next to it, presumably for spice, but it definitely was not. I posted a picture of the extra spice they gave me. It was slightly overfilled before I started adding it to my broth, and I finally got it to a decent spice level. 

The noodles were slightly better than the first visit. The broth was decent if not at all spicy. This tan tan is very peanut buttery flavored. If you've had the tan tan at Fukumini, it is definitely that style. I much prefer the tan tan style at Bachi Burger.

Service was fine once I was seated. I stood at the entrance for about 10 minutes and roughly the addition of 7 more people before being acknowledged. The weird entryway is probably to blame, but still... meh.

I'll come back eventually, but it won't be anytime soon. It'll be tough for the driving distance to make up for quality. Other places are just so much better."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. Every time we've gone we have had excellent service and amazing ramen."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in this area's ramen scene. Great food, great service, a clean restaurant, and no wait on a weeknight.

We started with Gyoza that was good and I liked the sauce served with it. Our ramen arrived shortly after in large bowl. My Miso Ramen was very good. My favorite part was the chashu which tasted like it had been grilled which added a slightly crispy texture. The ground pork, broth, egg, and other ingredients were great too. I asked for the spicy paste on the side and that was the perfect way to add some heat. There were tons of noodles and enough to take leftovers. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. He came by regularly to refill drinks and check on us. The food all came out quickly too."}
{"text":"Great Ramen noodle house if that's what you're looking for. The only thing I didn't like was my egg had started to change color for being in the soup too long. Also it's a little pricey if bringing the family. I had the kids share to help with the cost."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch in a the middle of the week and I was not at all impressed. The food is mediocre and extremely salty, only a limited menu was available for lunch,  while the place was almost empty, only 5 customers.
The noodles were not cooked, some parts were almost crunchy.... the seaweeds is actually noori leafs (dried sheets) and I had to ask for spices. If you put your stick s down for a second, they come right away to  take your bowl even if is not done. Some customers are greeted loudly while others are totally ignored. Not an authentic Japanese house. Is not representative of the real Japanese culture and cuisine."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen spots in Henderson. Fair price and one of the only ramen places that has fountain drinks not canned soda.  The environment is chill and clean. Nice area. Plays great edm music"}
{"text":"Ohjah is delicious!   And great service!  Thank you so much Eric!  I think we found our new default ramen place. :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food, I had an amazing experience. Their food taste great and the staff doesn't hesitate to help you in any way. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Love the food and love the staff even more. Always a pleasant experience. Definitely try the yakitori."}
{"text":"Very nice
We had 5 kids 
tried 4 different appetizers
Kids liked the noodles
The beef udon was great"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites! Don't skip the garlic edamame!! And the sauce for the egg rolls is amazing ...perfection!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you're looking for a nice hot bowl of ramen! I've been many times with my family. Even my Picky eaters find something they like. My daughter loves the chicken Kutsu my son loves the noodles and just broth. I highly suggest a vegetable bowl if you're feeling a little bit under the weather it is total comfort food. Everything is clean service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 3 as far as ramen places in tge Vegas area. I've tried the tonkatsu and the miso ramen. Both are delicious and fulfilling. We ordered the house fried rice which is also very good.  Make sure you order their special hot sauce on the side and use it sparingly. A little goes a long way and it is delicious."}
{"text":"The ramen here is so good! I've been to a lot of ramen places in Vegas and I think this is my favorite one. The broth has so much flavor, but isn't too oily or greasy and the chashu pork is so tender and juicy. My favorite bowl is the Miso ramen with medium spice and garlic butter. The service is always great too :) thanks Ohjah!"}
{"text":"I am so happy there is finally a ramen spot on my side of town (deep Henderson)!! We ordered for our appetizer garlic edamame, which was nicely seasoned. For our entrees two oxtail ramen and I added corn with mine and chicken fried noodles. The portion sizes are big which is perfect because I was pretty darn hungry! I also ordered ice green tea which I wasn't really a fan of bc there was no sugar in it, but if I had their green tea hot I would enjoy it better. 
The ambiance has dim lighting and music was modern. I think the place is cute and reminds me of Japan on how it's built. 
I would come here again, especially during fall/winter time!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open! The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing! I recommend coming here when you get the chance! :)"}
{"text":"So satisfying!!!  Quality, quantity and presentation - A+.  Service was excellent too.  She explained each dish so patiently.  They even threw in a sliced of mango cheesecake on the house!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place since it is right around the corner from my house.
Is it the best ramen in the valley? No, go down to spring mountain for that.
Is it the best in Henderson? Maybe, I haven't found a better one yet.
Broth is kind of plain.
Quaint sitting area.
Wait staff are super.
Glass walls so you can watch the kitchen is nice."}
{"text":"Well ramen is one of my favorite quick filling meals. Their squid skewers are just amazing and the staff is always so nice. It's a great spot for anyone who goes to Nevada State college and has a break in between classes"}
{"text":"The owner was very attentive, I believe the reason was because our server ignored us the whole time. She didn't aknowledge us AT ALL. and yes she was suppose to be OUR server. I would have given less stars if the owner didn't help us."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We've been here several times and it used to be excellent. Yesterday was a total disappointment. The tantan men was a much smaller serving, not as flavorful, and just overall meh. It used to be so good here!  Hope they get it together and go back to the old recipes and portions, even if they have to raise the"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome! I recently had surgery and I'm not allowed to eat noodles or rice. I ordered the Shoyu ramen with ground pork and no noodles. Eric gave me a look when I said no noodles but as soon as I explained that I wasn't allowed to eat them, he said not to worry, he would put some extra stuff in for me. When it came to the table it was packed full of veggies! It was absolutely perfect, the broth was so savory. I loved the extra spinach and bean sprouts. We also had the garlic edamame. Order them!! So garlicky! Seriously a step above the usual plain, salted edamame. We're so so happy to have a new noodle spot in Henderson! Especially one with such friendly people and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese restaurant. Quality ingredients. Have had nearly everything on the menu. Restaurant has remained consistent across about 10 visits. Very reasonable prices considering the quality.

I really enjoy the takoyaki. It's topped with generous amounts of katsobushi. Delicious.

Food 5/5
Service 4.5/5
Decor 3/5
Value 4.5/5"}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen places  in Henderson. Moving to Henderson from California, you don't have too many options of ramen places in Henderson. Most of the Asian/ramen places are located in Las Vegas/China Town. 

They have lots of options to add into soup. They're Tonkotsu is good and they give good amount of meat/noodle ratio. My boyfriend tried the Ohjah special and it was interesting to have oxtail in there. It was really delicious! I also highly recommend the black garlic oil, soo good! 

Service is good and quick! Definitely try out this place, I honestly think this is better than the overhyped Monta Ramen."}
{"text":"This is the second time visiting this restaurant and it was not as good as the first time. The first time me and my friend really enjoyed our ramen dishes and especially liked the garlic edamame. I would have rated this restaurant a 4 based on that experience.

The second time though was a bit disappointing. We ordered the garlic edamame, vegetable ramen and stir fry noodles. The edamame was still good but the other two dishes were not. My friend who ordered the ramen said it was bland. My stir fry was ok but I was surprised that it had meat. This is a dish that had no description in the menu and I assumed it did not have any meat. The taste was fine but this is not something I would order again.

Another thing that was a bit disappointing was how the food was coming out. My friend got her dish first and it took a good 7-10 minutes for the appetizer. After that, an additional 10 for my food. I rather had waited a bit more and have everything come out in order."}
{"text":"When this Ramen spot opened up I was overjoyed! I went in there way too many times and even ordered takeout a couple times. The staff was alway kind and receptive. Some even began welcoming me back as they began to recognize me. They are great with questions about what is what and adding extras. I like to customize my ramen and they make that very easy to do! The food is yummy, and when they package it to go it's done so nicely, it makes it a quick, simple, and filling meal either way you go about it!"}
{"text":"Maybe Ramen just isn't my cup of noodles?!

The shopping center Ohjah Noodle House is my go to shopping center so I had to try it out!
I ordered my own version of ramen, because nothing on the menu really fit my taste. I had the beef broth, with ground pork, beef, bean sprouts, scallions, and of course the ramen.

We ordered to go, and sat inside to wait for our meal, it was pretty busy and it looked like everyones food was coming out fairly quickly!

Upon getting home, i put my soup together, ( they serve it like togo pho, noodles veggies and meat separate from the broth.) I ended up NOT eating the sliced beef, i don't know what it was about the beef but it looked so un- appetizing to me i just didn't even want to touch it. My mom shared our meal with us and told me it tasted and had the same consistency as cow tongue, and that just does not interest me!. ( don't know if that's accurate.) 

Anyways, long story short the soup was okay. The broth was good, the noodles were okay, the pork was okay. :) it was okay. 

I probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"Just had the best vegetarian ramen since ever !! Yum .. definitely recommend this noodle house . The first time I've never finished a bowl of delicious ramen because it was so loaded with fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked yellow noodles. A ginormous bowl of authentic deliciousness!'"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my mom, as she is a ramen fan, and it was her birthday.

We started with the plain edamame (garlic is also an option), and I ordered a seaweed salad. These came out very quickly. Both were very tasty. My little one loves edamame, so she gobbled a ton of it up right away. My mom ordered a pork ramen bowl (I cannot remember the name!), and I ordered the veggie ramen bowl. My mom said hers was very good! Mine was okay, could use a tad more flavor of some sort, but still pretty good. My little ordered the fried noodles. These were VERY good. I highly recommend. She didn't eat them all, so we took those home, and they are just as good the next day reheated! I may go back just for these.

We then ordered the green tea mochi for dessert. Yum! Served with whipped cream and a cherry. 

The staff is very nice. They give you little candy with your bill, and the server saw how much my daughter loved hers, and gave her couple more to take home.

The place is very small, but cute and cozy. Located at an easy to find location. Not too far away, so I am sure we will go back one of these days! Now I am craving those fried noodles writing this review ;)"}
{"text":"The place is a bit dark even in broad daylight, the ramen is okay, nothing special with the tantanmen and miso we ordered. The chasu fried rice  is a little bit oily, love takoyaki."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great service and tasty fresh food. And the SAKE thank you very much Eric and staff I will recommend this place to everyone. Good luck and congrats!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I went on a Monday afternoon. The ramen was great and so was the service. Great price for that ramen also. We will definitely visit again. I had the miso ramen and my wife had the tonkatsu ramen. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Great noodle house for reasonable prices, food comes very fast. The restaurant has a open window to the kitchen where you can watch chefs make your food. Great service and I recommend the veggie rolls for an appetizer and miso ramen!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food looked like it was made out of garbage. Maybe it's supposed to look that way"}
{"text":"I'm giving Ohjah Noodle House #2 three stars because the service was decent and the place appeared clean. If I were basing my review on the taste and quality of the food alone, it would be one star. Maybe it's just me and my expectations simply weren't met. I don't know...
I enjoy soups and noodles and Pho and Pad Thai. I thought I would LOVE this place and I was so excited when it opened near my house. I placed a to-go order and brought back food for myself and my kids. We were all disappointed. The broth was pretty bland and flavorless and none of us found our dishes to be memorable. In fact, we ended up throwing over half of our food out because it simply wasn't worth eating. I expected tons of flavor and sadly there was none. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait for this place to open. OMG! Was worth the wait! This is our third time here and the food is amazing. Jing is the sweetest waitress ever. Eric the manger is very attentive to his customers. All the staff is courteous and quick to take care of your needs."}
{"text":"Place is good during winter time. But if you are vegetarian or pescatarian it'll be hard. Not much choice to choose from. But if just noodles and soup ? Sure ! I love the location they have here in Henderson. Plus they all come and greet you with a big smile. The price is very reasonable. I can come back to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Very expensive soup with little flavor for my taste. Strictly my opinion. My son and his girlfriend love it."}
{"text":"Very good very nice! Try the wasabi octopus! Very nice! I like all the food and drinks! Do try the peach sake! Good for girls! :)"}
{"text":"First time having ramen and I must say it was amazing. Food was fresh and full of flavor. The service was spot on. We came in late, they double checked before closing down the kitchen and did not rush us even though it was almost 10pm. Thumbs up to this place. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Really good !!! Good and friendly customer services If anyones near this place you should go and try it."}
{"text":"A lot nicer inside than I thought it would be. Wait staff was nice. Food was okay. Nothing special at all. My shrimp had no flavor. Tasted like they were frozen pre cooked shrimp that were thawed and placed on top of my noodles. May come back again but won't be making any plans to."}
{"text":"Great Ramen and Gyoza and fried rice.  
Miso broth is flavorful.  
Fried rice one of best in town, its light and flaky and delicately melts in your mouth.  Nice location and dining setting.  They will be very busy this winter!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a good ramen place in Henderson and Ohjah Noodle House popped up on the list. We immediately decided to try it out and we were pleased with our experience! 

We stopped by in the afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The waitress was very friendly, accommodating and made sure we were taken care of. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and my friend had the Miso ramen. Both orders came out fast and the taste was delicious! We had a great experience with excellent customer service.

However, the location may be tricky to find but it's definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Perfect ramen. Noodles were awesome. The broth is not too heavy or greasy- just right! Took my parents and they loved it too. I like the shrimp tempura ramen. The place looked closed from the outside but it's just the low lighting. Glad we made it! I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time trying Ramen and it was SO delicious!! I didn't care for all the 'extra' things that came in my bowl, but besides that... AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good. The staff was very friendly and the portions were huge. We are definitely going to return."}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to try this place and so glad we found it. The inside is very inviting and the entire crew greeted us as we walked in and also before we left. Their thin ramen noodles is so delicious in the perfectly seasoned stock....we tried the tonkatsu ramen and ohjah ramen which has everything in it. Cleaned our entire bowl of yummy goodness.

Service was excellent! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Slurp, slurp! Instead of heading to Chinatown, we were venturing off on our way to the Rise festival and decided to stop by this place for dinner.

1) Ohjah Ramen: it's basically a combo of oxtail, chashu, beef, egg, spinach and ramen noodles. It tasted great and it's a good option if you want to try a little bit of everything (5/5)

2) Oxtail Ramen: I love oxtail so I chose this one. Unfortunately the pieces they gave us weren't as tender so you really have to maneuver around the bone to get that meat off. Other than that, the broth of the ramen was pretty good and I liked the texture of the ramen noodles (5/5)

Prices are reasonable, esp if you're on a travel budget. Credit cards accepted. Service was decent but it can be better. We came here during their soft/grand opening so they were still working out the kinks. I recommend better organization of checking in customers and having a sign-up sheet like how other places do it."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food. Best noodles we've had in a very long time and the chicken wings are"}
{"text":"Best Ramen place around! No one else compares! Great service and the ramen is outstanding. I highly recommend the oxtail ramen."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food I've had in quite a while!!
The \"house fried rice\" is the best we have ever had.. 
Nice environment and a very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I had a craving because two nights ago I had some really good ramen near jones and warmsprings that was really good. (Can't remember the name, I wasn't going to drive way out there)

I ordered the beef ramen, it is indicated with one flame (my assumption that it is spicy) its not.. The broth is a bit flavorless. I ordered the mango cream soda which was good. 3 stars for the staff being really nice, but rating the food.. it's average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it is the closest ramen bar near work. Ramen is one my favorite dishes, and I have high expectations.The Tonkotsu ramen with garlic and butter warmed my soul. Great depth of flavor and thoroughly satisfying. With a side of deep fried oysters all for under $20, this place as earned another repeat customer! I've already recommended Ohjah to all my coworkers."}
{"text":"Yesfood is great.. service is wonderful.. had the oxtail ramen and our favorite takoyaki.. this place is worth going.."}
{"text":"After my third visit, I can honestly say this place is legit. I'm a fan of the seaweed salad and spicy pork soup. I usually add lemon and chili sauce for an extra kick.

If I had to give constructive criticism, the menu is difficult to read (small text) and the water has a finally taste to it. 

The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"So happy this place is finally open so I can get some tasty ramen at lunch from work.

The interior is pretty nicely decorated and clean. The kitchen is viewable through glass.
Service was really nice and friendly, I can't remember her name but she was very pleasant with a nice smile, and let me take my time viewing the menu and ordering.

I had the tonkatsu ramen with extra chashu and corn for $8.95++. The ramen is very good but not as good as Monta or Fukumimi.....that doesn't mean anything really as its still pretty new. Its good, and I will be happy to come back and spend my money again."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there was not much meat in the ramen dish we ordered. We had the mochi ice cream desserts at the end. They were very good.

The atmosphere is pretty chill and there is ample seating."}
{"text":"I got a flyer in the mail so I went yesterday to check out this place.. I ordered to go and the waitress sat me on the table and gave me iced water with lemon while waiting..great service for take outs!..I tried the tonkotsu ramen and fried oysters..it's so good!! the place is clean and so near where I live... Will definitely come back with my daughters to dine in."}
{"text":"Rip off. Chicken breast was sliced in half.. cooked and split between 2 people. Not worth 6.95 additional for the chicken. 8.95 was basic meal, veggies were like 1 cup worth. Spent over 50$, left hungry. They toss broccoli here not shrimp for entertainment.. cook veg 1st. Then rice. THEN start the meat. Chicken was last n by then rest was cold."}
{"text":"Went here the for the first time 2 weeks after they opened, with my bf & 3 children. We didn't really get to fully enjoy our meal with 3 kids one an infant. Food was good as expected. It's nice to finally have something good so close to home. (5 min drive) It's located in the Von's shopping center right on Horizon Ridge. Friendly staff &awesome manager I believe his name was Eric. We've gone to this place multiple times. 

Second time around we took one of my good friends visiting from California out to dinner & it was her first time EVER.. She's never even heard of it before and she loved it. This time around it was just adults. No children so we ordered 1 cold sake just to try & we ended up drinking about 5 hot sake that night, we started with appetizer garlic edamam & shrimp fried rice. She ordered the Beef Ramen, I myself ordered my favorite Tonkotsu Ramen & if I remember correctly my boyfriend ordered Shoyu Ramen.  At the end of our visit.. we had asked for our check and we were brought a dessert & the orange was cut so cute we didn't want to eat it. Needless to say this place is well worth the money spend. It just gets crazy hot there so dress lightly.

Third time around was our date night. Just a nice dinner & a movie date night. We walked in the Eric recognized us as soon as he saw us. We ordered our usual but this time we got the oysters and of course sake."}
{"text":"Well herrrro there new ramen place over in Henderson! I'm happy you're here!

Babe and I came here after our date night at mini golf because I was craving a bit of soup and noodles for some reason. Thank goodness this place is now open and pretty new! It's super clean on the inside and service is fast and friendly. They've got room for large parties, a bunch of tables and booths, and a bar top. I could see this place getting pretty busy. 

I got the shoyu ramen (chicken broth) with the pork chashu and added corn for $1. Babe got the beef ramen, with added spicy-ness. We both enjoyed and slurped the night away. Taught him how to properly eat ramen, spoon on the left, chopsticks on the right. Our dinner was quick and easy. I'm sure we'll be back when we've got a ramen craving! Can't wait to come here during winter!"}
{"text":"On a cold windy Vegas day a hot bowl of ramen sounded perfect. It was good, but I didn't love it. 

Ohjah is located high up on Horizon Ridge and the 95 in the Vons shopping center. Plenty of parking out front and I really liked the traditional japanese decor inside. Service was very good with being greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. 

We started off with the gyoza and ordered the tan tan men and the tonkotsu ramen. The gyoza were okay, I have definitely had better. The sauce had a strong vinegar flavor that I didn't care for. The ramen came out shortly after. 

I thought the portion size was quite large for the price (under $10). The ramen itself was good but the broth and overall flavor were just lacking. With so many ingredients it just should have tasted better. 

We ended with the green tea cheesecake which was quite dry, wouldn't order it again. The service was great, but was hoping for better food."}
{"text":"Star 1. Place is clean, nicely decorated and seating is comfortable. Size of the place is pretty decent too and can accommodate larger groups of like 8 or 10 I think. The server was very nice as well, prompt service and very polite. Food came out in a timely manner also

Star 2. Price was reasonable $9- $12 for a bowl and $5 appetizers. Portions were generous also. 

Star 3. The food was good, have I had better? Yes I have, but the food wasn't bad either it was decent. Broth probably needs to be a bit more flavorful but otherwise it was ok, not too salty not too bland, it just is not amazing enough. Playing it too safe I think. Also I did not like the chicken based broth, a lot of noodle places chicken broth has a certain stench to it, maybe it's just me, but I can't stand it. Am not gonna take it against this place because like I said I have not gone to a noodle place where there is a chicken broth that I like so again maybe it's just me. Chicken Katsu was ok also.

Star 4. What earned them another star for me was for the very generous portions of meat in their noodle bowls. Now this is probably what will have me coming back to this place, the meats that you can choose from or choose all for that matter with their Oh Jah House special noodles. It had Ox Tail, Beef and chashu pork. I like how they brown/ pan fry? One side of the pork, makes it tastier. Also we had their mango cheese cake and that was immediately devoured even before I could take a second bite. 

Suggestions: menu is very limited. They should have like a chashu pork bowl and chicken karaage and offer some pickled ginger."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and am never disappointed. The food is always well prepared, fresh ingredients, and the service is perfect whether they're busy or not. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was fast and very yummy! I recommend the shrimp skewers. My miso ramen was delicious. :)"}
