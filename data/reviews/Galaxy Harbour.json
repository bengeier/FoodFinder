{"text":"This is anything but NOT fish and chips for 100%!!! Weekends evening was empty... I should take attention to this fact, but i didn't...  So, credits first - place is clean (again, was empty), NO bad smell of burned oil, friendly and helpful stuff - that it! If you care about food - run as far as possible!!! Horrible tasteless very greasy butter over of extremely thin ( thinner  than quarter of inch) fish, became as a hard shell as cooled down, chips turned almost in mushed potato chips, not firmed and crisp, tasted as a  being rewarmed...     Eh...  sadly wasted money..."}
{"text":"Restaurant just opened this week so some co-workers and I gave it a try. Service was a little hit and miss, our order somehow got misplaced and people who arrived 20 mins after us received their food first. A bit of a squeeze to get served and eat within the lunch hour, they didn't seem able to cope with the rush of people.  Fish was excellent. Batter light and crispy. Fries were just ok, some a little undercooked. Tried the mushy peas and they were homemade but a little watery. I ordered a coleslaw but it never arrived to the table.  Menu is expensive, especially for lunch. I wouldn't spend that much for fish & chips again, in fact it's on the high end that I've ever paid for fish & chips. A lunch special might be a good idea featuring a smaller portion with a drink & coleslaw.  I would try the place again later in the year if they ironed out their issues and offered a better deal at lunch, as it is I wouldn't rush back at the moment."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. The place was empty and just the staff watching TV before we came in. We ordered quite a bit of food - calamari, fish and chips, beef pie and poutine. The food was decent, certainly wasn't the best. I found the beef pie not fresh and was quite salty compared to other places I've been to. The gravy was also very salty, so I wasn't too pleased. I should've ordered my own fish and chips as it was pretty good, though it had a lot of batter to it. Needless to say, I wasn't happy with the poutine either as the gravy was salty.. If I do come back, I'm likely to order the fish and chips only.."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review when they first opened:  Happy to announce these guys have consistenty improved over the months. The batter is light crispy and has a light salt favour; the fish is surrounded by just enough batter and you get a nice piece of fish - I've had all of their selections of fish and pleased with all. I tried yesterday the \"cobbler fish n chips\". This fish is like a filet of sole in texture + taste; very mild so for all you non fish lovers this could be your jam. Oh abd its cheap too. Of course Halibut remains my favorite. The other main thing I'm happy to say is they fixed their \"greasy\" fish problem. Overall I'll be going more."}
{"text":"Took my daughter for lunch on a Sunday.  It was okay...nothing I would go out of my way for. The girl at the cash looked like she hated her life and was totally unfriendly. Didn't smile.  Barely talked. Didn't check up on us if we needed anything...service was gross. Wouldn't go back just for that reason."}
{"text":"While a bit pricey for a one piece and fries; the food is serviceable and my son and I split an order along with the little calamari ringlets-you can definantly do without the latter as they are likely from a bag in the freezer in the back (next to the fries); however the fish seems fresh and my son seemed to enjoy it. I would encourage them to add a courtesy \"thimble\" of coleslaw. It would not cost anything and would be a value-add since the price for a one piece may hinder repeat business. We have seen business come and go (I.e the last lease was a stone-cold creamery) and I think folks like this one! The service was exceptional with the server pulling double and triple with the tables and the take out window. Not an easy task- earning the extra star. Kudos!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My friend suggested to check out Galaxy Harbour, a local mom and pop shop in Aurora for some classic fish & chips. Since we were in the area that afternoon, we decided to check out that neighbourhood plaza for a quick lunch stop.  Ordered a seafood chowder and it was creamy and delicious! We also had the 2 piece Haddock and chips plate to share - they offered to split it for us and we each get our own piece of fish and side of fries ^^ Service was very thoughtful and attentive, thank you!  The batter coating was crispy and had a nice light golden yellow colour. It was not greasy nor greasy-looking at all :) It came with lemon wedges and a side of creamy tartar sauce. Presentation wise, it was missing some greens, but taste wise was great!  The menu is quite extensive for a small diner. Other than fish and chips, they also have grilled fishes, seafood appetizers, pot pies, family pack specials, and kids & senior specials! The desserts sound amazing too - pineapple fritters with ice cream and coconut cream pie - but we had no more room after our delicious meal.  I will be back for more good eats. Keep up the great work, Galaxy Harbour :)"}
