{"text":"Came in looking for a hearty lunch - asked for one of their rice bowls but to cut the rice portion down and add more of the veggies/greens. They were happy to do so. The Mediterranean bowl was topped with greens, tabouleh, hummus, falafel and roasted cauliflower. Portion was really good and makes for a good dinner portion too. The other bowls looked just as yummy - salmon poke and chicken curry. They had a breakfast option with eggs, toast and avocado I believe. Other options are the smoothie bowls, and a long list of sandwiches (smoked salmon, turkey reuben, loads of veggie options too). It was great!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, the food, the service, the place itself and the location.  I rarely post a review and I am surprised being a year in business, Wilder Foods only has 8 or 9 reviews.

As soon as you walk in, the 15 feet ceilings, brick exposed, white wash wooden floors of this 130 year old building, just give you a great feeling.  The tables and chairs are all natural wood.  Massive 12 foot window facing the street, so lots of great light. 

I only had a latte and muffin, but I really need to come back here for brunch or lunch.  I know the latte was perfectly made because I didn't need to put any sugar in it.  That's when you know a latte is well done."}
{"text":"This place opened a month ago in the beautiful and newly renovated Campbell Block. (Which strangely has a relatively nice and clean A & W as well as Arcana Salon and several trendy Junction type stores.) The restaurant itself is light and airy with a few small tables and one communal. Faces east and has plants and wifi so I predict I will be doing a lot of paperwork there.
It has a limited but fresh menu. All the usual coffees and my latte was the second best I've had in the Junction. That is high praise as I drink a lot of them here. 
The smoothies are amazing. We had a green one that was $7 for 16 ounces (however much that is) and it was worth it. I never say that about liquids that aren't alcoholic. Can't wait to try the one with cacao nibs and almond milk. 
The bread was only just arriving when we got there but that is changing and it will be there before opening in the future. Sadly it meant we couldn't have the organic eggs with avocado and toast. This time. I made do with a cute veggie frittata that was filling enough to get me through to lunch. My friend had a lovely cheddar muffin. 
I am going back this week to try a sandwich. They have four kinds and some kind of bowl for breakfast as well as baked goods. It's nice to see a place that serves organic without being pretentious or overpriced and it is literally about fifty metres north of Dundas West so walk up and try it."}
{"text":"I come here daily for my Americano and I have to say this is one of the best hidden gems of the junction, from the decor to the food.. great brunch menu.. food is all organic, very affordable  and the staff is wonderful, highly recommended if you're ever in the area.. 
try the bulletproof !! Americano with Coconut oil and butter ;)"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on the Junction and absolutely fell in love! In the cutest neighbourhood and the decor of the cafe was stunning with brick walls and lots of natural lightning. They even have toys and story books for kids. I ordered a matcha and turmeric latte which was heaven and then a falafel collard wrap with beets, carrot and hummus. The barista was super informative and sweet! I will definitely be visiting again because they have the coolest options on their menu. Such a great cafe outside of downtown area."}
{"text":"Wilder is a great cafe in the Junction. Easily situated at the corner of Keele and Dundas West. The food is not pretentious. Nat, the owner, says she's worked in different kitchens in the past and you can tell by the passion in their food. Brunch is very busy, so you may want to get there earlier to get a table. Maria, the manager, has been doing coffee for a while so be sure to order the cashew flat white. WiFi is great!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this lovely new cafe last Saturday after a visit to the Junction Farmers Market. 

Exposed brick walls, plants and a bright window make this the perfect place to grab a healthy breakfast - it feels very welcoming! 

I wanted to try the acai bowl, but they were out of acai so I had the green smoothie bowl and it was delicious! 

My one suggestion that I hope you take to heart is serving the smoothie bowls in actual bowls, instead of paper bowls with plastic spoons. I really dislike unnecessary waste, and I'm sure a lot of your customers would feel the same way. 

I know the girl at the counter mentioned that a full menu is coming soon, so hopefully the change can be implemented then."}
{"text":"Decided to go check out Wilder a few weeks ago for a light lunch on a Friday. The space is very warm and inviting and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The place was not full when I arrived but definitely filled up when I left. I ordered a flat white and smoked salmon sandwich at the counter and took a seat at an empty table. The flat white was prepared fairly quickly but the food took a while (and this is because I assume that all the food is made to order and fresh). The staff were kind enough to bring my food to me once it was ready. Delicious, healthy, and filling. Great place for a light snack or meal. Will return if I'm around the area!"}
