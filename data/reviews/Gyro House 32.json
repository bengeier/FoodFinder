{"text":"This place is what they claim, the best Gyro in town. Fresh vegetables, great pita bread? Moist meat and perfect sauce. I add feta to mine! Mary loved her chicken Greek salad because every ingredient was done right."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Greek restaurant so far. The last time I had that Greek salad was in Atlanta Georgia.  they did it right."}
{"text":"We're customers from the Shea location and happy to see them reopened just north of Cactus.  I love the chicken gyro and greek fries.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We just came back from eating at Gyro House 32! Amazing. Their falafel sandwich is delicious! I normally leave with left overs, but tonight... I couldn't. It's a must try!! We look forward to trying the rest of the menu!! 

Thank you for a delicious meal!
Sultan and Chihnaz :)"}
{"text":"Love that this place is back in the neighborhood my wife and I used to come as part of our regular lunch rounds. Yesterday I got a gyro and fries to go and was not disappointed, excellent gyro and the fries were as good as I remember. Thank you Gyro house 32 for coming home, you guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! This was the best gyro I have ever had in the Phoenix area and I have been to quite a few Greek restaurants around the area. I ordered the gyro with fries. It was piping hot and oh so delicious! Amazing job and great service. It's in a very unassuming area, but if you're every close by, be sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"So, so taste. They charge more than ZK which I consider tops. Meat was not impressive. I only use them in case of emergency after Other Greek places are closed. Too bad they don't try to do better than their competition, then I would use them more often."}
{"text":"This is so good.

Tried the gryo and the shawarma. Both are a strong recommend."}
{"text":"So this place is really great I really missed them when they closed a mile down the street , I actually think they got a better location because it's got a street view as opposed to being stuck in the corner they had, the inside is inviting and with just a few tables and the main focus is definitely the menu .. I always get the gyro with Greek fries .. it's cheap and delicious and I'm grateful to have them back over this way . Definitely worth the stop by. 
They have desserts, drinks , ( bottled and fountain) they package everything to go but you can eat here"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful gyro, and was graciously accommodated by the owner, whose iPad/cash register was not working. Clean fresh atmosphere, I would highly recommend for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Oh, wow. I've had gyro meat in a number of places, including Greece and I've never had anything that tasted this good. We never order out, but Uber Eats and Gyro House are my two new best friends."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Really flavorful and portions are great! I will definitely be ordering from here more often, keep up the good work! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered via DoorDash for my family last night on the recommendation of a friend. AMAZING! Every bite was fresh and flavorful! They even had chicken strips and fries for my kids! Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY they are back open. They used to be on 32nd and Shea but closed abruptly, we thought we lost them....but their back!

Such nice people. Food is fantastic, fresh and made with quality ingredients. I usually get the gyro salad, meat is great, lettuce is fresh and crispy. I love steak fries and that's what they give you, so that's a win. Pitas are always just soft enough without being doughy. 

We will probably go once a week now that they are back. Very excited to have a quality, family owned, tasty option close by!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic just as better if not better than before! I just love their gyro and their tzatzki is bomb. I always have to order a side just for my fries. I live kinda far from them but def will stop EVERY time I'm in the area! The owner is the nicest and I'm sorry I missed her this round. Hopefully they have these brownies my friend raves about next time I'm by. I literally have no clue how they get their meat so moist and full of amazing flavor! YUM! See you soon Gyro House... 32!"}
{"text":"We chose this place because they had five stars but weren't so sure. When we pulled up to the place it looked really clean so we decided to give it a shot. Everything we ordered was just delicious. I ordered the Greek salad with gyro Meet and we also ordered falafel wraps. One with Chicken and one with Gyro meat. They were stuffed so full and came with a side of fries. The attention to the clients and detail of everything was exceptional. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times and it was good....tonightt I got take out and it was really bad.....i ordered a gyro for myself and my son...the meat was hard and cut in cubes...really gross....how could you do that...best gyro in Phoenix my ass...you lost a customer here"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem on accident and I was immediately hooked. I've become a regular, sometimes i take forever to order because I can never decide on just one thing, it got to the point that I ended up creating my own sand which. The beef and chicken shawarma are just mouth watering, the gyro meet is cooked to perfection. The falafel sandwiches are phenomenal, best falafel I've ever had. This is one of the few places that I can get my lentil soup craving fulfilled.
10/10 recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Yay! You're back! You serve the best gyros! I'm so happy for you guys! PS: all of your food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly. Delicious food. We had the Baba ganoush platter, beef shawarma pita with a Greek salad and a chicken gyros pita with Greek cheese fries. Portions are very generous. We dined in at a table for 3. There are not many tables because most of their business is probably take-out. Next time I want to try their desserts"}
{"text":"They're back and as delicious as ever! So happy to have this in the neighborhood again. Prices are slightly higher than I remember, but worth it... and I'm kind of cheap, lol. $10 gyro sandwich with fries, $1 extra tzakiki sauce. $6 chicken tenders (better tasting!) with fries. It's no-frills but still has games to grab and play. Had a good time with my two teens. Welcome back, Gyro House 32!"}
{"text":"Really really good a nice hole in the wall restaurant. The gyros were amazing and the ingredients were fresh would recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff. Loved the Greek fries. Will definitely come back to try the homemade baklava"}
{"text":"Vegan review: Gyro House still offers the same friendly service and quality food as at their previous location on Shea and 32nd St., but they menu has been tweaked a bit. I'm so glad they reopened! It's not quite as convenient for me as the last location, but still close to home! This is a great mom-and-pop neighborhood restaurant - so it's great to see them make a go at it again!

It's predominately a to-go place, with only a few small tables. The menu is pretty straight forward for a Middle Eastern restaurant. They offer a variety of items that either are vegan, or can be made so. Our favorite is the falafel pita sandwich, which has tahini sauce, hummus, lettuce, tomato and pickles on it. It also comes with a side of fries. The falafels are made fresh, and very tasty. The hummus is a nice, smooth and not to garlicky variety made with decent quality olive oil. I've had the Fattoush salad at their previous location and liked it a lot. The grape leaves are also vegan, and the thyme pita and Greek salads can be made vegan. The lentil soup has chicken stock though.

The service is outstanding and prompt. The best thing is that the owner is trying to transition to a plant-based diet, so it's fun to talk with her about food choices while waiting."}
{"text":"The food is OUTSTANDING!  Gyro meat was juicy and tender, price was low, and flavor was high.  I had they Gyro salad (large) and split it with my friend.  Perfect!

Only reason they didn't get that last star was that we ordered and sat at a table to eat-in.  They packed the food for us to-go and stated they only make their food to-go.  Why do you have tables then???  A little confusing, but we made it work."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and they took me to this restaurant. Now I'm from Los Angeles and we have some great gyros joints so I wasn't expecting much. This place beat any gyro I've had back home by far. You should definitely check it out if you're in the area. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is merely OK.  Gyro is beef only, no lamb anywhere to be seen on the menu.  Texture of the gyro is a little too coarse for me.  I think a lot of this enthusiasm here is to show support for a local business, but frankly it's over the top.  Not even close to being the best gyro in town.  Serviceable, but I've had much better just about everywhere."}
{"text":"Their falafel sandwich was so good! We ate there, but you can take out. Big fan! Will be back again. It's also exciting that they use GrubHub"}
{"text":"Wow! A perfect Gyro. Great fries, friendly service. Food was delivered to my table quickly. Hot and fresh. Large portions. I'm not in this area often, tried it because I like Gyros and the Yelp reviews were very good. I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I could not be happier that the Gyro House 32, is back open. They have the best Mediterranean food you will ever taste, from the falafel, gyros, salads and plates. I personally love the Gyro because they have the best meat and Tzatziki. Come here and get your fix asap"}
{"text":"My fav.  Couldn't be happier they have reopened in a new location!  Best gyro meat in town!  Even on strict diet due to illness they always seem to find a way to accommodate my obsession!"}
{"text":"Glad to see this place is reopened and in a better location than ever... Euros are just as I remembered and are still some of the best in the area thanks and good luck"}
{"text":"I'm not a connoisseur of Mediterranean food but I like a good gyro and this place has it. Simple and delicious! The meat is so flavorful! Friendly owner/staff. A small, family owned place. Great for take out but also has a clean, modern dining area if you want to sit down to eat.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Most authentic Middle Eastern cuisine! Amazing Gyros amazing customer service so conveniently located right off of the street at 32nd Street and Cactus!"}
{"text":"Had the greek salad with the gyro meat added. Very good and a very large portion as well. Came with a warm pita too. The place doesn't look like much from the outside and only has a few tables for dining in, but the gyro meat was da bomb. They also had a couple of family style gyro packs that looked like great deals. Meat, pita, veggies and sauce for you to take home and make your own gyros."}
