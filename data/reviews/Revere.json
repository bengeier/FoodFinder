{"text":"The service is off the charts good. The fresh focaccia is delicious. Wine selection is small but very good. All the dishes we've had are superb, and the carbonara is one of the best in the city.   Amazing addition to the neighbourhood it should not be missed."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and delicious food made from scratch.  Cozy and inviting ambiance.  We were a party of six so tried quite a few things off the menu.  There was a great selection (including healthy options) and we look forward to going back.  The chocolate dessert is divine!"}
{"text":"Tried Revere again. Portion sizes are small for the price. Several of us left hungry and ordered a pizza down the street afterward. I really want this place to succeed but they seem to think they can charge prices and have portion sizes of a trendy downtown place."}
{"text":"Great new place on the Danforth.  The food was great and our waiter was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We had the lamb shoulder and the tagliatelle and they were great.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood spot, and with a kids' menu and crayons, very family-friendly! Ours are all grown up, but we noticed several families and the kids were having a great time. We had the homemade ricotta, which was lemony and lovely. Then I had the steak tartare, well-spiced, and my husband had the soup, which he had devoured before I could taste it. For mains we shared the BC Scallop Risotto and the special of the night, Duck and Mushroom Risotto. Both were very good. Service is friendly, and attentive, and the prices are very fair. $13 for the tartare, a range of \"snacks\" (of which the ricotta was one) around the $6 mark, and $19 for each of the risottos. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had on the Danforth. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"An excellent neighborhood restaurant. The service was excellent, friendly and helpful. We enjoyed cocktails to start then shared an amazing fig salad. Very yummy. The special was a rissitto with beef marrow, quite different and delicious. The rissitto with scallops was very good. Portions are just right to allow you to enjoy multiple courses. We also enjoyed lemon tart. An excellent addition to the Danforth."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday October 13, 2017. We had a fabulous meal, in a friendly relaxed atmosphere. Everything was tasty and beautifully presented from the home made bread and dip to the kale Caesar salad, the house made tagliatelle, the pork belly, and the tiramisu for dessert."}
{"text":"I love that I can go to a beautiful restaurant and enjoy fresh vegan options. I had the cavatelli arabiatta and it was the perfect combination of salty, sweet, bitter and spicy. So delicious! The pasta is made in house and this particular one is made without eggs. They also have a gluten free, dairy free and vegetarian menu. They really pay attention to detail here and the service is so lovely."}
{"text":"So lucky  we have this in the neighbourhood! DELICIOUS from beginning to end. Have eaten there twice and both times were amazing. You can't go wrong with anything you order. The service is very friendly and the ambience is nice. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Revere is a trendy restaurant between Pape avenue and Donland avenue. My bestie and I visited for a girls' night out date!  The restaurant has a great vibe. Firstly, I love the blanket throw on the chair. It created a nice and toasty atmosphere. Decor was rustic chic! Service was fantastic. Server was kind. I appreciate separate menus for accommodating different dietary needs.   My bestie and I both opted for risotto; seared scallop saffron risotto ($20) and green risotto ($18). The complimentary house made focaccia was great. Crispy exterior, soft on the insider. It was perfect with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Unfortunately, we both felt our entree risottos were flat. Although her scallops were well cooked, she felt hers lacked seafood flavours. The overall texture was good but not flavourful. My green risotto with asparagus, celery, spinach, lemon and Parmesan suffered the same fate. It was bland. Perhaps it can use more acidity or lemon zest to lift the flavours.   I really wish I can lick my plate and give Revere a better review; however, the dishes just did not live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner as our kids were away for the weekend and we expected another reasonable Danforth restaurant but Revere was outstanding! In every possible way Revere exceeded our expectations...from attentive (without being intrusive) waitstaff though the starter, main course and desert we were thoroughly impressed!  Do yourselves a favor and check out the Danny and go to Revere!"}
