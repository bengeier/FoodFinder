{"text":"Wouldn't deliver anything North of Elgin Mills. Normally extremely decent food, but were rude and money hungry to not deliver one street North of Elgin Mills. As a result, cannot recommend.   Now closed, had it coming."}
{"text":"Wouldn't order again. They made a mistake on my order and refused to change it. They were extremely argumentative and would not change their mistake. Food was tasteless   Do yourself a favour.  Order elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"China Gourmet has been a long standing go to place for low price/large portion Chinese food. The food for the most part is good but is not high quality or well presented. It's what I call \"Canadian Chinese food\", lots of noodle dishes, fried stuff, and thick sauces. I enjoy their food but I find it to be more bland compared to other places. Spring rolls are plain cabbage and taste quite greasy as they are fried in the same oil as all of the meat/fish dishes. I find the lo-mein noodles are especially bland and so much food is packed into the container that it becomes like a brick. The chicken and seafood dishes were pretty good but I found their beef dishes lacking a tad in flavour and tenderness. Avoid the shrimp with lobster sauce as it's primarily thick brown sauce and minced pork. If you order over $25 of food they include an order of sweet/sour wontons which I find are a tasty side to accompany the food.   If you're looking for simple, Canadian-style Chinese take-out give China Gourmet a try. The prices are cheap and the food is plentiful! That's about it..."}
