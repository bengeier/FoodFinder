{"text":"We tried The Courtyard Grill for the first time today. Everyone was friendly and service was prompt.  The ribeye sandwich and the club were both very good."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch and ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fries.  Pork sandwich was stacked with a nice portion of sweet barbecue!  Fries were good.  Nice lunch stop."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food! Just a little slow bringing it out but they were slammed on Memorial Day Saturday. I had a chicken chipolte wrap. It was very tasty...and filling! The best thing though was the redskin potato salad! Creamy, crunchy from the onion and celery and loads of bacon! Through the roof good! Awesome family environment!"}
{"text":"3 empty tables. Waited 15 minutes to get our orders taken. Had to ask to get our order taken. No excuses either. Was not busy and waitresses were on phone. Then waited hour and 20 minutes for food. Had to ask about getting our food. Then they forgot to make one of the dishes for our friend. Food was bland. French fries tasted like those out of a freezer. Overall bad experience with rude servers and extremely long wait. It is a very nice building inside though."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise, thanks to Yelp.  We love Madison, IN and were there with our kids, grandkids over the weekend.  Last day there we were shopping, enjoying the river and decided to get some lunch before we all headed home.  Yelp let me know that Courtyard Grill was worth a try and NOT disappointed!  We all ate very good food (entree salads, great fries, cheeseburgers) and really good service for a last minute large group!!!  They were quick to accommodate two babies and two toddlers and 6 adults. We will definitely make this our go-to restaurant every time we go to Madison."}
{"text":"We come to Madison often for a weekend getaway. This place popped up out of nowhere so we had to check it out. They literally had only been open for 6 days. The place, which used to be an old bar, is totally remodeled and really nice inside.  Good menu selection, with variety. Good for lunch or dinner.  Food was great! We had the Buffalo Chicken wrap.  Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST French fries I've ever had. The food is good, but service is meh. I would have given this place 5 stars if the service was better. We walked in and seated ourselves as the sign said to do, and waited about ten minutes to meet our waitress! All of the wait staff were standing around the bar talking. I made eye contact with them multiple times and after about the fifth time, our waitress finally came over and took our order. It would have been been understandable if the place had been busy but there were only three other tables occupied.   TL;DR: GREAT fries, poor service."}
{"text":"Great food, environment,  and staff. Fish sandwich was great. I'm always looking for local restaurants to try out. This was a great pick based on locals recommendations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for linch here today. I had a grilled tenderloin. Mother in law had the fish sandwich. This is a good lunch spot in downtown madison. Give it a try. ."}
{"text":"Looks like a new restaurant.  The waiter was very friendly and thorough.  Too bad they don't serve any beer or alcohol (there is a bar next door though).  We had buffalo wings for appetizer and it was good.  The fish and chips and main entrees were average.  Overall, an average place."}
{"text":"We live downtown Madison and enjoy eating here because the service is great and the food is even better.  Simple sandwiches, great fries, all made very well.  Recommend it as a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was very pleased with service, and atmosphere. I tried the black bean burger, the only complaint is it was thin. The taste was perfect. The fries was great. My 14 year old daughter had the chicken wrap and was pleasantly surprised at the taste. Cant wait to go back."}
