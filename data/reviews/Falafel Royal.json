{"text":"Great neighbourhood shwarma joint and great service. The owner really makes you feel at home. The tzatziki mix is great, especially with the potatoes."}
{"text":"Ah, The food is tasty. I love everything. The place is small but i dont mind. It has a nice decor and a nice vibe to it. You can order food for parties as well. I did ordered once for my birthday and people love it. Good Food!"}
{"text":"Well to be completely honest I'm not sure that those who say this place has great falafels really know what falafel is supposed to taste like. I have tried pretty much every falafel in Mississauga & Toronto. This place is by FAR the worst. The man has ZERO enthusiasm. He gives you old nasty falafel balls that clearly have been sitting for hours if not overnight. It was honestly so dry and tough to eat I nearly choked. If a fresh, made to order falafel is what you seek. Do not visit this place. Sorry to say but the lack of enthusiasm has probably scared thousands of customers away. Get it together guys, lots of falafel eaters out there."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for two years and it is so amazing!!! It's a family owned business which I appreciate but the food is the best. Everything is always made with love. The owner is a kind gentleman who I always tip for great service. Def a go to place for Lebanese food."}
{"text":"We've only had the Chicken Swarma wrap and it was small and the chicken was dry. It tasted okay, but I've never been back"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a tasty falafel sandwich then look no further. The other food is half decent but my family and I are hooked on their falafel sandwich - nicely spiced, throw in the tahini, humus, onions, pickled radishes, tomatoes and parsley and there you have a tasty and healthy sandwich you won't feel guilty eating. We live in the area and this is our go-to place for a scrumptious falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"My local Falafel joint when at work. I've never eaten one of their plate combos, but they look like a good deal. I just pick up two falafel sandwiches with hot sauce, haven't had a bad one yet. $2.49 each - $1.99 on Saturday. Not a lot of room to eat in, a few tables and some stools, so I always get them to go."}
{"text":"I have officially given up my search for any type of decent shawarma and/or Middle Eastern food in South Etobicoke; it's just not going to happen.  Some of these places I've tried is making Villa Medina look like upscale dining.

This review is solely based on the beef shawarma (wrap).

PROS: very well spiced meat, generous on the toppings and meat, good tahini

CONS: gristly pieces of meat, hummus was flavourless, turnips were like mush, wrapped very, very loosely so incredibly messy, pita not heated

It's really such a shame because, as I mentioned above, the meat was so flavourful and spiced well.  All they really had to do is charge a bit more and offer better quality ingredients and I know for sure that, the way Long Branch is heading, they would see more business.  Also, the gentleman that served me was very nice and made sure to wash his hands prior to assembling the wrap and then after using the cash register.  

Prices on the website need an update.  Beef shawarma wrap was $5.99 NOT $3.99.

2.5 stars because the friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using uber eats and it was a great experience.  Didn't know the place was there as I rarely go down along Lakeshore.  

We ordered two shish tawouk dinners.  They came with three skewers... one chicken, one beef and one lamb kefta.  Although the beef was slightly dry, the flavour was great.  The other two were fantastic! 

The rice with lentils and fried shallots were amazing! So much flavour and not greasy or dry.  Perfect.  The side of humus was very generous and also has a drizzle of olive oil on it.  Salad was good too... simple cucumber and tomato salad with a light oil and vinegar dressing. 

Highly recommend and will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Shawarma place in Etobicoke. I tend to get the felafel sandwich, and can not complain about anything. The toppings are fresh, and the business owner is a very nice person. He  washes his hand before making my sandwiches, which I also appreciate very much."}
