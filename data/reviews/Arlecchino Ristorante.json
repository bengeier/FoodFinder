{"text":"Celebrated a friends birthday at Arlecchino Ristorante, Peters Township on Friday night. What a wonderful evening - exceptional service, delicious  food. The atmosphere is very hip like a downtown restaurant. Birthday wishes to my friend were posted for all to see and her menu was personalized for her birthday. The valet was wonderfully friendly. Love this restaurant and the energy on a Friday night in Peters Township."}
{"text":"This place is amazing & the service was tremendous!!! From the Smoked Provolone to the Pasta to the Veal!!! One of the best places around, hands down!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Born in Pittsburgh But for the last few decades now live in San Fran Bay Area. So coming back, I was thrilled to discover this amazing gem of a restaurant off of Hwy 19 in Peter's Township. An old 1 room schoolhouse updated to a bistro style open kitchen filled with the delightful aromas of fresh, homemade deliciousness. Their Chop Milanese is perfection on a plate... Easily big enough to split the double chop with someone and still have leftovers. Their classic starters of homemade meatballs, hot stuffed peppers, and their Arancini (which are more patty shaped than the usual rice ball shapes) are exceptional. For their included pasta course, go the extra mile for they table side mixed white pasta con Pepe ...I won't spoil the surprise but trust me, it's worth it! Went there twice in the same week. Bravissimo."}
{"text":"Visited early on Saturday evening, and had a wonderful experience. The menu is wonderful, and although not inexpensive, the portions are hearty and provided us with leftovers. We ordered tuna and sea bass and were delighted with the meals. The salad was one of the best and freshest that I have had recently at any restaurant, a wonderful blend of flavors. The pasta side was fun, especially with the infused oil added at the table.  Will definitely be back as there are meals left to try."}
{"text":"The food was really good!  They had great service.  Great atmosphere for a date night!!"}
{"text":"This is by far some of  the best food I have ever eaten!  I have only been there once, so far... I will def be going back.  It is a bit pricey but worth every single penny.  The service is fantastic, and the restaurant itself is very cool (it's an old school house).  If you have the cash and the time, I recommend that you give Arlecchino a try; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't go for the pork Milanese. Their signature dish is not at all flavorful and while it was quite tender it lacked any sense of uniqueness. It's overwhelmed by bland breeding. For the $65 price you should have a much better dish and this one falls far, far short of a great restaurant experience. The steak Diane was much more tasty and a very good dish. Have also seen positive comments on the pasta with vodka sauce. But I must say its pretty unremarkable and if anything was uninspirational.  Wait staff was very good and attentive. I'm sure they Have other good dishes but I think you can do better for your money and get a better dish at other area places."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere, too bad it can be ruined by the overall haughtiness of the place. Tried to have a great romantic experience here but was essentially rushed through dinner. My wife and I laughed afterwards. We didn't mind the prices, but it seems like they didn't want to ensure repeat business.  Tip: please try to train a little friendliness into your staff from reservations to the servers, especially for people who try out the restaurant for the first time. Or tip to customers: don't tell your server that it is your first time there or you may be talked down to and rushed out the door."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. Worth the price. Be prepared for a European 3 or 4 course experience table reset and time between courses. That would be fine but it's extremely noisy and loud so idle time conversation is difficult."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience.  We went to celebrate a birthday and we weren't disappointed!!The food was great and the ambiance was amazing.  We had pumpkins Martini's which were simply delicious.  Our server was very helpful and attentive.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this weekend for our anniversary.  It was amazing!  The food prices are high, but the alcohol drinks are just as much as any chain restaurant.  I recommend the cherry rum drink. The Steak Gorgonzola was cooked perfectly!  My husband had the veal and loved it. I also recommend paying the three dollars extra to get the alfredo pasta.  We had leftovers for three other meals.  Caroline our servicer was great! She was very nice and let us take our time.  We didn't feel rushed like the other reviews said.  Overall I would definitely recommend going to arlecchinos for special night out!"}
{"text":"I Dine here frequently for both business and recreation. The building is an old school house, formerly the restaurant \"The Classroom\". Enjoyable little spot just off route 19S in McMurray.   Sister place to Alla Famiglia. Same owners, same great food from the smoked provolone to the pasta to awesome veal. Cozy balcony bar and not usually a long wait with a reservation. Have walked in once or twice as well with not long of a wait.  Corkage is typical. Visited most recently with two other couples and had shared appetizers, good service and a typical bill for a restaurant of this caliber.  Go hungry . . . and enjoy"}
{"text":"This was seriously the best meal I've ever had. Anywhere. I was in a state of delirium by the time we were near the end. I couldn't remember my name. Escarole, white beans, sausage. Meatball. Pastas of every kind. Veal. Mussels. I want to move back to Pittsburgh now."}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here! Last night, we  were amazed by our Anniversary dinner. As always, the food and service were great. But it was the little touches that makes this place special. Our Anniversary wishes on the overhead blackboard, and on our menus and special Happy Anniversary. We fell in love with this place a couple years ago when we came for the first time and it just keeps getting better.  PS. If crab cakes are on the menu- get them!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The cooking staff(artists) was wonderful. Everything impressed me more and more each bite. This place is a true gem."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here for special occasions. The food is always over the top especially the special pasta you can order - they make it table side in a wheel of cheese. Great presentation and delicious. If your tell them you are there for a special occasion they will custom print menus for you - very cool. Yes, it is expensive, but in my opinion well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, so it's time to write a review! Complimentary valet service, check. Cute little intimate loft bar, check. Nice patio with retractable roof, check. Great service, check. Great food: phonomenal beans and greens (not vegetarian), meatballs, salad with entree (love the plumped raisins), the pasta and vodka sauce (it's rare I love a vodka sauce), and the steaks....yum! They had a Sirloin served Diane style (mushroom and onion sauce) but I wanted the Filet. They were easily accommodating. The server said any steak on the menu could be served Diane. Prepare to take home leftovers and remember to leave room for your entree, it's hard to do!  Mondays are no corkage fee. Came here for our anniversary and brought wine from our trip to France. They even made us special menus with anniversary wishes printed at the top. Nice touch!   The only thing that I wasn't impressed with was our servers lack of wine knowledge. Glad we brought our own. The server we had during last visit had a great knowledge of wine, so I'll let these cancel each other out this go."}
{"text":"Made a reservation the week prior; so we were informed we had to sit at the bar at 5:30pm, no problem.  Made a note to hostess that if a table was available please switch us over.  We sat at 5:30 and observed a table behind us at the bar unoccupied we left at 7pm.  Drinks were good to average for the $16 pour on a Manhattan and Comso.  First course of salad was a good mix of greens and red beats with raisins, but take it easy on the dressing.  Second course was a dish of pasta with red vodka sauce, that was average to the taste.  The oil that accompanied the pasta was never explained by the bartender or server.  Wife ordered the Linguine with Red Clam Sauce ($36); 20 oz of pasta with partial clams and an average red sauce.  I ordered the NY Strip medium rare ($60) that was 21 dry aged; it came out Med Well, which was corrected by the server after I asked the bartender to take it back.  I picked off some of my wife's pasta while I would have loved another drink, but the bartender was not observant enough to even offer.  My steak came back out - Medium Rare on the sides and Rare in the middle, I wasn't about to send it back a third time so I had it wrapped up to go.  You could do better at Ditka's or Hyde Park for the price of this steak.  NO offer of additional drinks or even shown a desert menu.  Glad we had a gift certificate for our 23rd Anniversary, we won't becoming back.  Valet parking - what a joke didn't even bring the car around they parked it, pulled it out and let the customer walk through the lot to the car.  If you are in the South Hills and what good Italian go to Armstrongs or DeLallo's"}
{"text":"Impeccable food and drinks.  Cool atmosphere.  This is a great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Arlecchino's last night. Let me tell you, those other reviews that mention large portions were not kidding. Our waiter Art, was a treat and very knowledgeable. Brandy the GM and owner gave us a tour of the outside dining area before we left. Ok.. Now about the food which is why we were there. We started with a bruschetta and eggplant parm appetizers. The eggplant was tender and the sauce and cheese fabulous. The bruschetta was good.. If we had not been spoiled by the bruschetta you get at Mia Madre's in Kennedy I would have said better than good. The table side preparation of Cacio e Pepe should not be missed. My wife ordered a filet covered with a Gorgonzola sauce that was perfect. I had the veal Milanese which is huge and so so delicious. We brought our own wine that went well with our meals and was happy to pay the $20 per bottle corkage.. being a first timer  it was no big deal.   Needless to say, we had lots of leftovers and suggest you go with a larger group of friends so you can sample more of the apps and different meals.   Can't wait until the next time!"}
{"text":"Second visit in less than a month.  Once again: the stars were the Veal Chops and the Prime filets.  Service was slower this time than last, but not terribly so.  Everything was great, including the Peanut Butter Gelato, and Mango Gelato.  Please make sure to read the full review below..."}
{"text":"pricey, great service, for the couple or family looking for a relaxed, long evening with laughter and yumminess. good for the body and the soul.   this is a multi-course served dinner. bread, then salad, then pasta, then entree. LOTS AND LOTS of food. I had the salmon - topped with fresh vegetables and some raisins, on top of a bed of spinach, with asparagus on the side. YUM.   husband had veal, their specialty. LOTS of leftovers, and he is happy to have them.   come and spend the time - you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Well not sure how to put this but, super full before my $100 entree got there. Had veal shank with a lobster tonight. Veal was fatty. $100!!!!??????Lobster was great.had 4 drinks ,my girlfriend -2, 1 appetizer 2 main course meals 1 raspberry Tiramasu- which was heavy cheese cake not even close to tiramisu! And my bill was 355.00 !!! With tip!! IWow!! It shows to why you charge your outrageous prices.  Don't waste your money for over priced food. To bad dish is closed!! Go to 131 in Carnegie. Much cleaner meal. Chef comes out and greets you. What happened to you J.."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just recently recommended to us and I can't believe we didn't know about it before. What a hidden gem! The atmosphere and service are top notch. And the food ... I was truly wow-ed by everything. The prices look high but they include salad and pasta as well, so to me it's worth it. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"My literal favorite restaurant in the world. Lynn upstairs is an angel. Definitely get the \"elephant ear\" Veal Chop"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Pricey, yes, but well worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"I would recommend their steak.  It is unbelievable!!!!   Great atmosphere.... I'm so glad it is close to home!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! The old school house gives it such a cool vibe for starters. We always sit upstairs, it's just more intimate in our eyes. I took my fiancé here for our first date and the rest was history! The food is excellent as well as the wine selection! I highly recommend for any date night or just a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Don B on this one.  The problem is two-fold.  the quality of the food doesn;t match up with the price and the management does have an attitude. OK, maybe three-fold.  The wait staff are not knowegable. I've been there twice.  Was not impressed either time.  Too bad since, I do agree, Peters Township needs more restaurants of this type.  Based on my experience, however, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've never given a 5 star review but this experience was worth it. We have been to excellent restaurants when we lived in NJ and DC so that is our frame of reference.  Four of us went on a Saturday night to celebrate a successful business result.  It was Saturday so yes it was jammed.  We were seated within 10 minutes of our 8 pm reservation, nice. Staff was friendly in a down to earth style.  Waitstaff was very attentive and non-intrusive.  No greeter at entrance was awkward. We really appreciated the suggestions from our waitress.   Food portions were large, as in \"Jersey diner\" sort of way.  Appetizers were excellent, mussels rocked.  Portions were more than enough. I don't eat veal but two people at our table did and raved about it.  My lamb was great.  When I made reservations I was asked if this was a special event.  Liked that.  With two drinks our bill with tip, was expensive for Pittsburgh, $400+ , but it was a special occasion."}
{"text":"Definitely an amazing meal. The ambience and service were great. I thought the food was a bit overpriced for entrees. Overall a good experience. A good tip was to make a call ahead reservation and sit in the bar. Two tvs and a good beer selection."}
{"text":"We went to Arlecchino with friends last weekend. It is a fairly small restaurant, with more than enough staff. We had reservations and were seated immediately, but not waited on until everyone arrived.   The food was phenomenal, and I almost never use that word. You could really tell that everything was homemade. My only \"complaint\" would be that I didn't split a meal, because one meal was WAY too much food.   I had a mahi mahi with shrimp, and it was really good. We also had both the cheese bowl pasta and the regular vodka sauce. I liked both of these... I don't know what I would pick if we weren't all sharing, but I suggest doing the cheese bowl at least once. We also tried all 3 desserts, but the tiramisu was by far the best.  I suggest sharing an entree but getting individual salad and pasta courses... This is your best bet for sure. Great food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful building.  Balcony bar is very cool. Food was good. Go here starving and ready to spend top dollar for sure because they serve large portions. We could of ordered one meal for 2 and still brought home leftovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and great atmosphere.  I came here with some co-workers and one of our clients. We started off with one of the craft beers offered at the bar upstairs.  We tried 4 of the appetizers. My favorite was the meatball. Cooked perfectly with amazing flavor and texture.  My main dish was the veal chop. You cannot go worng ordering this and I would absolutelyorder it again.  We each had a small dish of the alfredo pasta that was made at our table in the cheese wheel. This was the best alfredo sauce I have ever had!  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so delicious! I highly recommend their house salad and Any of their pasta dishes. The cocktail menu is different and delicious and even though it doesn't seem to be a kid friendly restaurant, we have been treated wonderfully anytime we have brought our children"}
{"text":"This is one of the better experiences that I have had at a restaurant from beginning to end. The atmosphere is refined but comfortable and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. My drink was iced tea and it was superb, clear and crisp. The bread was warm and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and went perfectly with the dipping sauce, oil with pepper. Their entrees come with a salad and pasta so I did not have and appetizer which I didn't miss due to the hearty and tasty dishes before the meal.  I used the oil that Wendy recommended for a little extra kick to the pasta, evoo infused with peppers. My entree was the steak diane and it was cooked perfectly and tasted delightful. I have no hesitation in giving a five star rating. It was exceptional."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had our first date here and we go back once or twice a month for our favorite dinner! I highly recommend the smoked provolone and the salad and vodka pasta is my fave! When we can't make it we grab take out too! The bartender always greets us happily and remembers us! One thing we didn't love recently, we feel like the take out gives you less food than dining in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's consistently fantastic. I've had just about everything on their menu at this point and nothing is less than delicious. It's a staple for us on New Years Eve and they never let us down.   The owner/Hostess is the perfect Host and all of the wait staff are extremely professional. Environment is good for a romantic dinner or a family outing.   For the record and being from New York originally, I'm a bit of a food snob and pretty hard to please.....not lying to you here when I say, you will not be let down by this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good but WAY OVERPRICED! The blonde girl working the bar acted the whole time like it was a total bother for us to be here. I'll never go back. For a high end place they have low end service, and that's being nice. When we asked for the manager the girl boasted that she was the manager. Wow, I feel bad for the owner..."}
{"text":"Complimentary valet was very nice. The meatball and sauce was excellent. The sautéed calamari was ok..it was actually slightly over cooked which makes them the texture of rubber bands. Some of the pieces where done perfect. The linguine and white clam was good, but really nothing special. We had so many left overs and we just split the pasta dish. We did still opt to try a very unique Tiramisu, made with chambord and vodka instead of coffee. It wasn't bad but I'm a big fan of Tiramisu and it's better with espresso. The service was good and the wait staff was very nice. But the price is not worth it. I'm willing to pay $100 for 2 appetizers 1 pasta dish, 1 dessert and 2 glasses of wine, if it knocks my socks off.. this was just good. And I forgot the really weird part. This was our first time here so we weren't familiar with the place and when we first walked in, we were literally standing in the dining area, for what felt like 10 minutes, and no one even greeted us. My over all opinion is if you have really deep pockets and service is more important than the taste of the food or your looking to impress someone it might be worth it to visit. But for me I think it was way over priced for what we had, although  I might go back for just the meatball and sauce. That was really good. Sorry, I had to give 3 stars, but I really think you could have something here, if you read the reviews and take some of the tips."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food and have never had a bad meal at Arlecchino. However, while it's all delicious and we are willing to pay good money for good food, it's unreasonably priced. There are equally as good, as well as far better restaurants in terms of cuisine in Pittsburgh and many don't come close to the price points of Arlecchino.  The veal chop is one of the best meals I have ever eaten, but in no way is the $65 cost justifiable. Coming from a 100% Italian family and having spent a good deal of time in various regions of Italy, the menu isn't what I would consider authentic Italian food. Our last visit was made wonderful by not only the food, but by our amazing waiter, Carl. Aside from the pricing, we don't care for being sent to the bar to wait when we've made reservations. Seems like a money making ploy and this practice is not a trait expected from a finer restaurant."}
{"text":"Second try now that they have lowered corkage.  Good, but does not live up to the hype the owners attempt to create.  Arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation on a Saturday night.  There is no hostess station - you walk through a door immediately into the dining room.  Can you say awkward?  After a couple of minutes, someone finally noticed us and pointed us towards the upstairs bar as \"our table was not quite ready\".  Thirty minutes later we were seated - which was a relief as the bar is very small and crowded and very, very noisy.  I'd give it three stars for atmosphere.  Too noisy and too crowded and the lack of a hostess station upon entering is terrible.  Service - our waiter arrived promptly and apologized for our wait.  Menus were delivered, bottled water ordered, wine opened and poured and bread dropped off.  It should be noted that the stems for the wine are cheap and generic - same stem for red and white.  Hard to bill yourself as an upscale spot with cheap stems.  The waiter returned and offered a few suggestions.  We decided on the cheese plate to start.  It is described as a daily selection of three cheeses.  When it was delivered, I inquired as to what types of cheeses they were.  The waiter did not know and had to check with the kitchen.  He returned and named the cheeses without providing any information on type of mile, sharp or mild, etc.  I like to be informed when I dine out.  Missed the ball on that.  A good, but uninspired salad arrived next, after a substantial wait.  Certainly nothing special about it.  It was served family style, which left one of us picking around the beets.  Next up was - again - a good but ordinary pasta served with vodka sauce.  Again, served family style.  A little bowl of grated parmigiano reggiano was left on the table - guests could serve themselves I guess.  I prefer mine freshly grated tableside and that is what I expect when paying $40-$50 per entree.  After another long wait the entrees arrived.  Once again (broken record huh?) good, but not exceptional.  Portion size is big, but I would prefer more healthily portions (i.e., smaller).  Service = three stars; Food = four stars.  Arlecchino's biggest issue remains the attitude of the owners and staff.  They seem to believe they offer the best dining experience in the South Hills and they are sadly mistaken.  Several other restaurants in the area offer equal or better dining experiences - some at lesser costs.  Dinner for three - with two corkage fees - was $175.  I don't mind spending that - I just want value in return."}
{"text":"For the price you pay.... very over rated. Had seafood diabolo. Lobster was tuff, mussels very small. The whole dish was  camouflaged with hot spice. Alfredo side was way to cheesy and cold. If you are offering Italian leave it Italian. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I had a hard time writing this review. The food at arleccinos is absolutely incredible. The family style dinner is absolutely delicious from start to finish.   You must try the meatball- to die for! We also had the beef carpaccio which was also very delicious. The next course was a fabulous salad that had beats, golden raisins, Suns flower seeds, and a subtle yet delicious salad dressing. Up next, was a delicious bowl of pasta and after that we had a steak which alone could have fed my husband and I. Needless to say we had lots of leftovers the next day.  I have a two-fold reason why I gave it 3 stars. I have eaten at this restaurant several times because the food is great and it's in my neighborhood, that being said the food is extremely overpriced. You can figure that for food alone it's gonna cost about $100/person which is capital grill kinda pricing.   The difference between this restaurant and capital grill however is that capital grill's staff is quick and efficient. Each and every time we come here they never find our reservation and make us wait around to be seated. The wait staff is very friendly but they're usually all running around like crazy trying to keep up with the tables. The environment isn't very ritzy either.  If you ask people to pay lots of money... It should be a full and complete experience...and it's just not there yet.  I'm still rooting for you Arleccinos!"}
{"text":"Get the veal.  They have some originality in the menu.   Perfect for a special occasion when you want something different from the standard Ruth Chris.  Reservations needed, or go to the bar.  Yea, it's expensive.  Get over it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely deserves a 5+ and beyond. We went in on a Tuesday. Arlecchino features a Tuesday Family Night-its really quite awesome that they offer this- 2 different chicken dishes to choose from for an outrageously affordable price. Our neighbors told us about it, and we were floored! We think you are a 5+ in what you offer and appreciate the great pains you take to train staff to provide such exemplary service. The Cheese with Pasta (Cacio di Pepe) is Amazing-      You do so much---lost art kind of things       You are a 5+"}
{"text":"Let's start with dessert..... You have to save room for the raspberry almond Tiramisu!  You have to!  It is fabulous.  There is cake layer, super soft and not too sweet.  Then a  cream cheese/marscapone layer. (not sure the exact ingredients)  It is thick and creamy and amazing.  Then a raspberry Chamborde layer.  Sweet and fruity!  Then the layers repeat and it is topped with crispy sweet almonds.  OMG!  I love this dessert.  The serving is really big, and as much as I love everything on the plate, I still share with my husband because it is a big portion.  My husband and I had this dessert as our wedding cake, that's how much I love it!    Ok, I'll calm down.    This restaurant is the sister to Alla Famiglia, and is set up in a similar style.  Meaning: Lots Of Food.  They bring bread to the table with a pepper oil.  It is tasty, but I try not to eat any to save room.  They offer many starters, although I recommend skipping this too.  Your dinner comes with salad and pasta!  It is a ton of food.  The salad is really yummy with raisins and sunflower seeds.  The pasta is really great too!  Creamy vodka tomato sauce?  Yes, please.  The dinners change up a bit.  I had a sea bass.  It was covered in huge chunky of crab and a delicious sauce.  The fish was really fresh. My husband got the double thick veal chop.  (He managed to eat the whole thing, although I am not sure how!?!)    For dessert......oh wait, I already went over that.  They have a few other options, but why kid yourself?!?     Our service was great.  I would definitely recommend a reservation!  It is not a huge place, but it is popular."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for Italian cuisine in the Peters area IF you can live with the high price.  The meatball appetizer is my favorite (a giant meatball filled with cheese I think). Great selection of wine.  There is a cozy/small bar area. Staff is 5-star restaurant good and friendly. Valet parking is complimentary (but please tip the guys anyway - we are not in Japan!)."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the burg.  Veal chops best on planet.  Greens and beans were \"silly good\".  Good wine selection good service.  There is no doubt it is overprice for the burbs of Pittsburgh, but if you can overlook the sticker shock, you will enjoy one of best meals in town."}
{"text":"We had gone for dinner about a year ago for the first time and had been wanting to go again.   We had the opportunity to go again last night and it was as amazing as the first time!  Started off with mussels and delicious bread.   The house salad served with the entrees are so crisp and fresh.   I had the veal Milanese with mozzarella and crab.   My mouth just watered writing that!!!! Tre yummy!!   Hubby had the Bolognese.  Scrumptious!   We took desserts home - Cannolli and flourless chocolate cake that were divine!   To top off the great meal, Carolyn our server was an absolute delight!  There was enough veal and pasta left over and if it was possible, it was even better as leftovers! You can't go wrong choosing here for a fab meal~"}
{"text":"Cheesewheel! Cheesewheel! Cheesewheel!  Only Pittsburgh restaurant to offer pasta made from the cheesewheel (Cacio e Pepe.) It comes as a free side dish if you order an entree. You can decide between that or the fusilli vodka which is equally as delicious. For my entree, I ordered the seafood diavolo. I was delighted to see good portions of lobster in it. Main courses also come with a delicious salad!  Dessert was mediocre but the main foods made up for it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. Maybe I'm at an advantage compared to other reviewers because I wasn't paying the bill. Their spicy red pepper oil is a good addition to the pasta course. I had a gorgonzola steak dish, which was perfect for me because I like blue cheese. We had plenty to eat and took some leftovers home.  I thought the wine list was good with a variety of selections that you don't see everywhere.   The atmosphere is charming, and the valet parking is much appreciated given the odd parking lot."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the money. The food was mediocre at best. My mother had the veal and it was pounded so thin you could only taste the breading which was dripping with grease. The fish was alright but also wet with grease and tasted like it had been reheated over and over again. The only thing on our table that we found edible was the bread.  The waitresses are definitely under trained. A lot of rude reaching and bumping while we were trying to eat our meal. The whole meal felt rushed and like we were a major inconvenience to them for even being there.   I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. There are a lot of restaurants with better food at a MUCH cheaper price."}
{"text":"I had a horrible dinner there last night. The salad had rancid sunflower seeds in it and was soggy from too much dressing. The pasta was good but our party of five adults shared a bowl so I had about 1/2 cup. Not enough for me. I usually have a cup of pasta as a serving. I  had the worst chicken. Are two bites and couldn't eat another bite. It tasted like they put a meat tenderizer powder in it ... it was a pasty, almost pre digested texture. The breading was soggy and flavorless. My son ordered the ny York strip. Once again a very unpleasant texture. He also couldn't finish it because it was unpleasant. As for the veal parm, I've had better veal parm at ny metro area puzzarias on the cheap. They use slices provolone as the cheese which smelled yucky and tasted sour. $400 for a family of five (no appetizers) was just too much to pay to not have good food. I am just astounded and can't even believe what crappy food we had for extortionate prices will never go back"}
{"text":"First time to try the sister restaurant of Alla Famiglia...a friend suggested it because we were in Southpointe. The building....awesome, a turn-of-the-century schoolhouse. The bar...second floor walk up, cozy, friendly and very comfortable. The restaurant...love it...great space, open and airy, tables not crammed one on top of the next. The food is very good. We started with the smoked provolone and the bruschetta. The smoked provolone is sublime. I chose the veal Milanese which is a double chop pounded thin and sautéed with pine nuts, lump crab meat and some tart lemon...this is huge and so tender you can almost cut it with your fork. The crab is fresh and compliments the lightly breaded veal...sort of a twist on surf and turf. My dining companion chose the filet with Gorgonzola cream, also very flavorful and perfectly cooked...medium well...just like she ordered it ( a travesty in my opinion but then I wasn't eating it!). The house salad and the fusilli pasta w/ vodka sauce are both good. The salad has roasted beets which makes it delicious in my book! Ignore the naysayers and the tightwads...this place is worth every penny...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with my husband & son for my birthday 18 August 2014!  Appreciated the birthday wishes on the menu & overhead whiteboard. Shared the mussels & baked artichoke hearts for hors d'oeuvres. The crusty bread was perfect for dipping into the spicy tomato sauce that the mussels were simmered in. My husband really enjoys the addition of marinated beets to the house green salad. A primo piatto of fusilli in a vodka sauce was just enough to whet the appetite for the outstanding Veal Milanese served with lump crab in a lemony butter reduction. We were all unable to finish our main course & took plenty of leftovers home to savor. Even though we were more than full, my son ordered tiramisu in honor of my birthday. It was creamy, light & truly divine with a luscious raspberry filling. Our server was helpful, pleasant & most attentive. The place was hopping for a Monday night. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here for our seventeenth wedding anniversary.  It was absolutely wonderful.  This was probably one of the best experiences we've ever had at a restaurant.  We were not expecting the amount of food, but course after course the food was delicious.  The atmosphere was quaint and not pretentious at all.  This restaurant is all about the food.  They won't care if you accidentally use the wrong fork.  The ingredients are fresh, the recipes are unique and the service is impeccable.  Thank you for making our evening special."}
{"text":"A little pricey. But love the meatball stuffed with mozzarella. Also their vodka sauce is the best and you can buy it to go.   Update: was here tonight and it was amazing as usual. Great service from Kiersten and another gentleman behind the bar."}
{"text":"Dinner was superb, which we expected as Alla Famiglia is still one of the best evenings we've had in awhile. This restaurant is housed in an old schoolhouse, with gorgeous, original hardwood floors and high ceilings. Definitely take a moment to gaze up at the blackboard, which was original to the schoolhouse as well. The kitchen is an open concept, with a beautiful diamond patterned stainless steel background. I loved the ambiance, but it can get very loud because of the high ceilings and open concept. Fantastic for a boisterous group dinner but not quite the right setting if you're looking for a more quiet, romantic night out. The food was fantastic, I adore their pasta with a vodka sauce, but the highlight was actually when the chef refused to serve something. Let me back up, our friend ordered the tuna and around the pasta course the server explained that the chef was not happy with the tuna and wanted to talk to her about it. So the chef took the time to come out and speak to her about different options and how he could prepare a different fish for her. I was blown away that he took the time to come out and say the product was unsatisfactory and offer options to rectify the situation. Absolutely superb customer service and we really appreciated it!!!  All in all we would absolutely return based solely on the knowledge that the chef takes great pride in what he serves to guests and refuses to serve something subpar! Kuddos!!!"}
{"text":"Please forgive my late review! We went over the summer and aside from a salad, there was only one vegetarian option. Our waitress seemed like she had somewhere else to be, as I'm sure most people think at work, but made us feel like a burden. I did like the atmosphere but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Super expensive, but worth the money.  The mozzarella appetizer is really, really, really good.  The cork fee is too much at $15 per bottle, but their recommended red at the bar was decent.    The bar area is small, but has a great beer selection.  The staff is wonderful and is very helpful in assisting with your orders.  Reserve early because it is usually very crowded."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The filet and Gorgonzola was to die for. And they have amazing meatballs. I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you haven't already. Tight on parking though."}
{"text":"We love this place - especially the \"old schoolhouse \" ambiance. Food is great and good wine list. And the portions are for two days! One caveat however: too much Arugula on everything!! We know it is the new \"foodie\" green of the day, but everything comes drenched in it, so much that you can't find the dish!  Our zucchini in goat cheese - too much arugula.  Our mozzarella dish - too much arugula.  Salads - too much arugula.   Enough already!!  Let us enjoy the flavor of what your cooking inspires- true Italian dishes with great sauces and flavors, not hidden by arugula! If there was one recommendation to make this a more enjoyable restaurant, it would be \"less is more\" - especially when it comes to arugula!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had recently. Awesome service and equally good food. If you like Veal this is a must try place for it. Appetizers were also top notch as was the wine list. I'm sure reservations are the way to go on a weekend night as this place gets deservedly busy"}
{"text":"There are no words to express how amazing everything is at this place. Amazing is not strong enough... go there at least once in your life, you will not be sad you did."}
{"text":"As good as it gets, but you are going to pay for it.  Don't get me wrong its a wonderful place.  Atmosphere is good, service is top notch, menu is entertaining and the food is outstanding.  The complimentary pasta with vodka sauce and the pepper olive oil is close to the best pasta I have tasted (other than my own).  However, all of this loveliness is going to cost you around $250 for a party of two with a bottle of wine around $50 and no desert.  Save it for special occasions, but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow! We came Arlecchino with some family while we were visiting and were blown away!  The wine list was impressive and so was each food selection. We started with the mussels and the stuffed banana peppers. The sauce on the mussels was divine. My husband had the veal chop was perfectly done and tasted scrumptious!  I had the veal and it was very tasty as well. The tiramisu was the perfect finish to our wonderful meal.   Our server Erin was fantastic!! She refilled our drinks without being asked and was very prompt to keep our table clean! Miss Jackie was so kind and helpful with getting our reservation! Hope to return when we are in town again. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I came here for my birthday dinner and had a wonderful time. When I walked in I noticed that they had my name on the chalkboard above the open kitchen, which was a nice touch. They also had printed menus personalized for me. These little things really made the meal exceptional.   Their warm bread and dipping oil is a nice way to start the meal as the oil is very flavorful. We started off with the salmon carpaccio, which was excellent. It was well dressed and flavorful. Then, we had the house salad. For the pasta, I had the cacio e pepe option, so they made my pasta table side in the huge parmigiano reggiano wheel. I believe this is the only place in Pittsburgh to offer this as I have only had this before in Australia.   Finally, for my meal I had the chilean sea bass with jumbo lump crab and my dad had the barramundi. The sea bass was one of the best cooked fish dishes I have ever had. It was so soft that it was almost buttery. The creamy grain mustard sauce and crab was a nice addition, but not even needed as the fish was so good.   Overall, one of the best meals I have had in Pittsburgh. Our waitress was outstanding. The personalized touches really made the dinner special. Finally, the food itself was perfectly cooked and delicious. A perfect restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have ever had in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it is pricey but you really get a lot of quality food for the money.  I went with a party of 5 and the bill, with a few cocktails was a little over $600.  BUT -- we all had a nice evening and took home enough food to have dinner the next night.  3 of the people in my party had the veal shank and they loved it.  It looked like something from the Flintstones it was so large.  I had fluke with crab and it was delicious.  For appetizers we shared the giant meatball (it was) and the smoked provolone.  The provolone I would have again, but I would try something else instead of the meatball.  Make reservations because the night we went it was packed.  I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"what an addition to our area.  Great food and atmosphere.  We ate at the bar because it was still crowded at 9:00 on a Friday.  A little on the pricey side but worth it.  Also maybe a little small inside for the crowd but again, still worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but it comes at a very high price.  Are we in NY or San Francisco?  When a veal chop can cost $65 or a steak in excess of $60, you need to navigate the menu carefully.  You do get a beautiful salad and a small pasta course, but you're paying for it dearly.  The veal scaloppini was pretty good but sitting in a pond of olive oil.  On a very positive note, the best \"beans and greens\" we've had in Pittsburgh.  Really nice patio for good weather evenings."}
{"text":"Delicious from beginning to end! We ordered the meatball appetizer (amazing!), I had a veal dish with crab and pine nuts, my husband had a pork chop. Highly recommend! Our waiter was also excellent I wish I remembered his name, he didn't miss a beat!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Italian I've ever had from a restaurant... always a treat to make a trip here! The wait staff makes an effort to cater to every need without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Sea bass was outstanding! A Light mustard seed sauce and lump crab. Yum. Don't eat the whole day Before you go. Just the bread and their Delicious oil, the salad and pasta would be enough - so you have to pace Yourself!  Good luck with that."}
