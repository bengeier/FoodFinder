{"text":"Very good tacos and great price , they have very good salsas happy hr 3-6 every day beer
Only 2.25 and 2 tacos for $3"}
{"text":"Okay breakfast burrito that took 15 minutes to prepare.  I questioned it, the girl was rude about it, 15 minutes is normal.  Yet two other customers came and left before mine arrived.  No apology, nothing but push back.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"My experience was not a very good one. I was ignored for about 2 minutes before the woman at the other side of the counter acknowledged my presence. Later when I got up from my table to get more salsa, I returned to my table to find my drink and basket of chips was cleared. I went to get a new cup and sat at my table. The waitress brought me soft tacos instead of the traditional fried hard tacos I ordered. After some time the waitress brought me pre made hard shell tacos, not traditionally fried tacos. I asked for a refund and when I did, the woman at the regester argued with me about what I ordered. Worst customer service ever. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and a clean environment. We stopped by for Sunday brunch after New Mexico Grill started closing on Sundays. Now Tacos n More is our go-to Sunday morning restaurant. They serve free chips and salsa while you wait for your food and I love the mild salsa which has a hint of sweetness. If you are looking for a sit-down establishment with ambiance, you will not be satisfied. However, if you want fresh tasting, quick tacos or burritos, this is a great place. They also have a tiny margarita bar with what looks like margarita slushy machines. We have not tried the alcohol choices, but we will when we go for dinner."}
{"text":"BEST BURRITO I'VE EVER HAD!! I'm not kidding. The shredded beef burrito had the most tender, lean beef. PERFECT! The tortillas are homemade and delicious!!! Excellent balance of flavors. Mango margarita was excellent too. We will be back again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"Very good! I was actually extremely impressed!! Loved the ambiance, traditional decor, nice size, food was really good. We will be back for happy hour too. It was packed, did not expect it to be so big inside. Loved it and will be back soon, we found our new place. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a quick lunch break. I ordered the Enchiladas plate. Oh boy, I was so disappointed. The red sauce was horrible. I wanted to like this place, but it was horrible. I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos top my list of omg cravings. First bite of the machaca breakfast burrito with potatoes and cheese made me pick up the phone and call my husband; he then endured five minutes of me telling him how much he would love it. Burrito was huge, tortilla sublime, guacamole salsa noms. Will be going there again."}
{"text":"The 1-star reviews on here are suspicious.

I've been here multiple times and the place always looks sharp and clean, the staff is very pleasant, and the food is terrific. On top of it all, the price is very, very good. I just finished a pretty large steak quesadilla, side of sour cream, side of guac, and then pico de gallo and very good guac salsa plus a medium drink for 8.50. Killer.

Pro Tip: it's immediately next door to Tailgaters bar. Do the math.

I'm pretty sure I just found one of my new local favorites."}
{"text":"Best taco place close to us! Serrano's is closed on Sundays and this new place is great! Good food, reasonably priced, and definitely satisfied the need for tacos and nachos!"}
{"text":"I came here for a brunch and was expecting some decent mexican food. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the cheese quesadilla ($7.00) and a bacon breakfast burrito($5.00). I paid around 15 bucks which I didn't mind. They gave me some free chips while waiting and those with some salsa weren't that bad. I then got the food. The burrito was very limp consisting of just egg and bacon, which I thought was way too overpriced. Then the quesadilla looked like it was made a day before and tossed in the microwave. I ate the entire burrito and a quarter of the quesadilla. I don't know if it was an off day but it was not what I saw on here. Would always go to another mexican place for the same price with better food."}
{"text":"I don't know why I come back to this place. Their food is mediocre at best and they take longer than ANY fast food restaurant I have ever been to. There could be one customer in the place and it will take 10 plus minutes for a bean and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Love this place! The asada street tacos are amazing! Love the homemade chips, as well. The staff is young, but very nice. I've really liked everything I've tried, but will keep coming back for the tacos."}
{"text":"Gross!  I think the other + reviewsare padded from friends and family.  Terrible quality, fatty meat and poor service.  You've been warned..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch. Food has been ok and we went about once a week for the past 6 months or so. It's close to my house and its convenient when we want ok Mexican in the neighborhood and don't want to drive.  I wouldn't consider it the best Mexican food but some dishes such as the enchiladas with green sauce are good, avoid the red sauce because it tastes like pizza sauce. 
Last time we went the owner (which I found out later) gave us a 8oz water bottle which is like coffee cup size. I usually drink a whole glass of water but I figured I would get some more later. Food arrives and we run out of water so I asked a server for more water or water cup so I can have some more. A woman comes over and announces \" I'm the owner and we don't give out water cups because people steal soda. It's a $1 if I want water\" I told her I didn't need to steal \"soda\" and  she could just fill the water from the machine if she was concerned I was going to steal. She raised her voice and exclaimed again \" People steal, and that's our policy!\" How Rude! From reading other Yelpers, I'm not the first person this encounter has happened. Never again!"}
{"text":"Not even remotely authentic, portions are kids size at best and flavorless. Everyone raves about this place, my opinion spend 5 extra minutes head west to Val Vista and stop at Pa Pa Chevos."}
{"text":"Great food.  Loved the nachos.  The staff was nice.  Check them out."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The posted hours of operation as well as the voice mail recording says they are open on Saturdays at 7am.  I called on April 23rd at 7:05am to place an order. The recording came on. I decided to go ahead and head up there. I tried calling twice while on the way. Now the phone line was steady busy. Upon arrival 4 other people were standing outside the establishment. The lights were off and the place wasn't open. It was 7:21am. Not professional at all. I immediately left and drove over to ALFONSO'S Taco Shop. It was open and ready to serve. Also ALFONSO'S prices are lower and no extra charge for potatoes or cheese. I will not support Tacos and More again and I suggest you don't as well."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in South Gilbert.  We had a carne asada dish for a family of 5 and it was really good."}
{"text":"Just left tacos and more at queen creek and Higley in gilbert. I have frequently been to this restaurant with our friends and family.  Stopped by on my own to grab dinner tonight and as always the food was great. Not so for one employee.  Purchased my dinner and asked for a water cup. Sat down and while  I waited for my food I went to get my water from the soda machine. Pushed the button that said all drinks couldn't find a button for the water so filled my little cup with sprite. From across the room I hear a voice calling out that my cup was for water and not for soda.the employee aproached me and said I would have to purchase a soda cup for my drink. Not wanting to make a scene I complied.  The I started to think how rude she was . Took my dinner and soda cup up front and tried to explain to her but she said it was a matter of principal  . just handed my food back to her and left discussed. When I take my family in my average ticket is around  $70.00 . They lost my business over  5 cense worth of soaded. It's a matter of principal."}
{"text":"Good, clean casual dining.  My husband had the fish tacos, and I had the carne asade tacos.  Both were delicious and exceeded our expectations.  We will return when we are looking for a quick inexpensive place to eat."}
{"text":"Finally went here. Got hard shell taco plate. Steak had nice char, carnitas was tender. Love the guac salsa. Best part was the churo. My wife gets them every where we go, and this is by far the best churo we have had."}
{"text":"Food is very plentiful and I love the salsa bar. Their pico is to die for"}
{"text":"This used to be a fun little neighborhood place. The last few months it has gone down hill. The new booths are a nice improvement. However, there are more downsides. Chips and salsa are not complimentary any more. The margarita bar is gone and so are the margarits, but they are still on the happy hour menu. The outside patio is now gone too. The soda machine was out of CO2 today. The Mexican music was so loud you couldn't hear the TVs. Then a musician came and the noise level increased by 10. So much for a quiet dinner. Still not too many customers. I don't know what the deal is but I'm going to Moreno's or Someburros from now on."}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito was excellent! Prices were fair. Seating area is very clean.  We will be back for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Best taco shop around here. The place is very clean, customer service is good, and the food taste and quality are even better. I would eat like ten of their al pastor, carne asada, and fried fish tacos by myself. Burritos also taste great and would fill you up. Not understanding all these negative reviews. Foods come out very quickly, mostly within 10-15 min. Whoever said it takes 45 min to get your food, so exaggerated lol."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish it was closer to home but that may be dangerous as I would be in here way more than my budget could handle.

Excellent southwest mexi foods. Friendly helpful staff and a family friendly menu. 

Chili relleno was awesome as well as the street tacos 

Go get some!"}
{"text":"Okay for quick Mexican food, a little high price though for what it is, I'll drive past and go to papa chivos."}
{"text":"Excellent. great flavor. free chips. 100 flavor coke products dispenser.  very good in all regards. Real plates and silverware. Walk up to order and they deliver to your table and they bus the tables."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Arizona and my first taste of the food.  It very fresh which I love. Tasty and the meat was tender"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada burrito fully loaded and my wife had the chicken burrito and thought it was better than any burritos in the area.  I moved here from California 8 yrs ago and have been in the search of a good burrito since.  This is the closest yet.  I also like to judge Mexican food by the chips and salsa and the flavors were good in that area as well.

The decor in the restaurant is appealing as well.  Two big fridges full of beers, two big screen TVs and a nice all around taco shop feeling.

Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. My husband went to pick up Pozole and a breakfast burrito and paid over $17 dollars for absolute garbage. Neither of us finished our food bc it was inedible. Most of the actual meat was chewy fat and the broth of the pozole had no flavor! It was like murky water. Hardly any hominy or meat, it was mostly tasteless water. My husband could have bought a bigger burrito at Taco Bell than the pathetic $6 burrito they gave him. The last straw was their horrible, rude and ignorant teenage girls that work at the counter. She was super snappy, rolling her eyes, and make a snarky \"gee thank you\" when my husband refused to tip her given her s**tty attitude. Bad customer service with ignorant girls, less than mediocre food...save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I go here a lot.  For convenience. Good and bad. The ground beef is seasoned horribly and over cooked and leaves a bad taste in your mouth, the carne assada is fatty and very chewy.  Everything else seems to be ok. Good tostadas, great salsa bar. Serve beer."}
{"text":"Well, tried to have a few tacos tonight only the employees decided to close early...sign says open to 10 however at 9:10 they turned us away. Not good for a new business that is trying to make it."}
{"text":"Our first and only time here. First, you have to pay for the chips. What Mexican place charges for chips? I saw something black in my ice in my soda. I am usually the person who tough things out at restaurants but that was gross. The layout is like it will be quick but we waited over 30 minutes for food. I can say, though, the guy working tonight was a trooper and apologized for the chips fee and the wait. My food came about 5 minutes before my husband's. He ordered a burrito chimichanga style no sour cream. It came with sour cream and looked like it was baked in bbq sauce. We decided that would be our only time ever eating there."}
{"text":"Great food!! I'm walking out so full. The service was great & the place is clean. The set up is really nice and there alcohol options. My husband and I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Try the hot salsa and pico mixed it's the best around!! They have yummy tortillas and I've never had a complaint about my food. It's my new favorite place. From burros to nachos it is all amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered off the online menu and when we picked up the food the price was higher. They need to correct the prices on the internet site. We got a burro and tacos. The taste was ok but not much to them. Very little lettuce on the side with a thin slice of tomato on top of the lettuce. We are used to getting alot of chopped lettuce and tomato with our entree. No little bag of chips to go also something other places give.I feel it is worth the drive to a good place further away. Will not go here again."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after my second time going to this place for breakfast and the review is solely based on the breakfast.  The first time I went I had the Menudo and my wife had one of the combo breakfast plates.  The Menudo (rojo) was tasteless and had very little tripe in it.  They do have a bar with all of the fixings for you and trust me, you will need it.  I will have to say that the salsa they have on the bar is delicious and tastes very fresh, thus 2 and not 1 star.  The breakfast my wife had was also very bland and somewhat cold.
A few days ago I went again, this time with 5 other friends, including the one friend that continues to say that this place is \"really good\".  Out of 6 people, 5 had menudo and 1 had steak and eggs.  Out of the 5 orders of menudo, 4 were so cold that they had to be sent back, everyone but mine.  Mine was extremely hot and you could see the steam rising from the bowl but it was again tasteless and had little spice.  Again very skimpy on the tripe.  Apparently the steak and eggs were good, he said that he had no complaints.  They did give us free churros to make up for all of the cold food....wuuuhooo.  Just can't think of a reason to go back here and probably won't."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews...but the service and food here warrants one.  I was really hoping to like this place, but sadly I was VERY disappointed.  The staff was rude and seemed disinterested.  The food was, in a word, horrible.

I had the cheese enchilada plate, a steak taco, and a chicken taco.  I don't know what they put on the enchilada, but it definitely wasn't enchilada sauce.  The \"steak\" was just charred pieces of (I guess) beef.  The chicken was bland.

I may give it another shot in the future, but first impression was terrible.  I guess I will give Gordo's a chance tonight...hoping for something better."}
{"text":"Tacos n more is my hands down favorite taco shop! I typically order their burritos or tostadas. Both are delicious! I love the salsa bar too- what a neat idea! The catering they have done for us on a few occasions has worked out perfectly. Who doesn't love a nacho bar?! If you live in Gilbert and haven't tried out this place you are seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken burrito chimi style. Wasn't bad...the steak was obviously roasted and was in chunks, not shredded. The beans and rice were good...the rice wasn't dry like most places. Was disappointed our takeout did not include any salsa. Don't most Mexican joints give you salsa when you take out? Guess you have to order it. Wi try it again but will order something different."}
{"text":"Just avoid this place. It will be out of business soon anyway for the following reasons: 1. After offering a punch card since they opened, they cancelled the program right as people stared redeeming the punches. So, even if you already earned the free burrito, too bad!This is just one sign of short-sighted management who will refuse to give away a $5 burrito to someone who has historically spent $50+ per month here for several years. 2. It's way overpriced. 3. Low quality food and ingredients. 4. Long wait for food. They used to give you free chips at least while you waited. Now, you don't even get that! Bottom line: I used to go a lot because of the convenience of the location only. But, it's gotten bad enough now, that I'll make the drive to get better food, better prices, and better service."}
{"text":"We live across the street from here, so we get take out here about 3 times a month. The prices are average, and the food is generally pretty good. My only complaint as far as food quality is concerned is the hard tacos. I'm a huge fan of shredded beef hard tacos. I like the kind of tacos where they put the meat in the tortilla and then fry it to make the taco hard. At Tacos And More, the hard tacos are the ready made taco shells like what you would expect from Taco Bell. I guess doing it that way saves the cooks time. Aside from the terrible taco shells, the rest of the food here is delicious. I would recommend it for anyone not looking for hard tacos."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the good. Food is great. As a Mexican Yelper, I give this place a passing grade on the authenticity of the food. Taste 'almost' like my moms home cooking. You know, nothing is better than my moms home cooking, but this place is pretty darn close. The create your own breakfast burritos are pretty darn good. 

Great Happy hour from 3 pm - 6 pm daily with $4 Frozen Margaritas, $3 wine, $2 any bottle of beer :), $4 Nachos, two tacos for $3, $2 Bean ans Cheese. 

The only 'bad' to this place is, you have to pay for chips ($1). Im used to free chips at Mexican restaurants. The salsa bar is off the hook. Green Salsa is my fav. 

This place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. The enchiladas we ordered had some interesting red sauce that was drenched over my cheese enchiladas. The sauce was overwhelming and the enchiladas were tiny. The salsa bar is nothing fancy..there was a couple of choices to choose from. They gave out complimentary chips but they came in a reusable plastic basket. I would think they would at least be lined with wax paper. Who knows if they just re-use them without washing them.  Ok but will not come back again. Too many other better places to eat authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Driven by this place a million times but never stopped until last week. Their carne asada burrito is really good and the meat is flavorful and tender. The hot salsa really is hot which is hard to find at mexican restaurants. The woman who took our order was friendly and made recommendations when we indicated it was out first time there. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a Taco Salad with shredded beef and I was stuffed when I finished.  There was plenty of shredded beef and I liked that even though I got my order to go, they gave me chips to eat while I waited for my order.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I never eat tacos, but I will recommend this place..los tacos al Pastor are great!! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and I usually get the bean burrito with potatoes burrito. Doesn't sound exciting but as a vegetarian, I have limited options...plus they are good here.  There are many options for everyone and my friends always like their choices. Good albondigas soup, Chile rellenos, tacos and more (just like their name). Order at the counter and the workers bring to you table. Service has varied the various times we have gone. There is a nice salsa bar...I find Stephanie is always very nice, friendly and is always smiling! the other workers (sorry I didn't get their names) were not so friendly and/or happy.  Food is reasonably priced and I would definitely recommend given Tacos N More a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada. A bit tough actually but my wife and stepson ordered other dishes and said they were great. Roomy and casual. Very nice staff. Will go back."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for 3 years and finally decided to give this place a try tonight for carry out. I can now say that it is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. It reminded me of the frozen Swanson Mexican dinner meal my mom use to throw in the microwave for us when she didn't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Yikes!! They don't allow you to have water and charge you by the bottle!! I've been going to Tacos N more since they opened. The beginning few months the food was hit or miss. One day it would be great and other day not so great. I'm a rational guy and I figured they are still trying to figure things out, consistency, recipes etc. I gave them plenty of chances and even though food is not fantastic, it's edible and close to work so they remained on my list to eat for lunch. 
This last time however is the deal breaker. I only drink water thus I asked for a water cup. The owner hands me a 8oz bottle, which is like half a coffee cup size.  I like my Mexican food hot so I knew it wasn't going to be enough.  Once I ran out of water, I ask for more water. The owner comes angrily at my table and states, \" \"
I'm the owner and lot of people ask for water cups and start drinking soda so we don't give out water unless you pay a $1.00 for bottle!!\" I told her I don't drink soda and am not planning to steal hers. 

How can you run a restaurant business and charge for water??? If you are that concerned about people stealing your soda, put it behind the counter!! Stop admonishing the customers for asking for water!!! Shame on you!"}
{"text":"This place is VERY good and has a good salsa bar. Very reasonably priced and better than anything I've ever had at any \"ertos\" places!!"}
{"text":"Great taco spot!! Good food at a good price!! They have happy our specials and service beer and margaritas. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Used to live this place. Portion size wasn't that great for the price but it was still a decent restaurant. Unfortunately last time we went the service was slow and there were bugs in my burrito. Can't bring myself to go back and try it again..."}
{"text":"Use to work in Maricopa and tried the first one there. When I heard they were opening up another, closer to where I lived, I was pretty happy! Shrimp burrito, grilled shrimp, is one of the best I've ever had. Lot's of shrimp, rice and pico, and their sauce. Good value for the money. Nice interior, with two big screen tv's, HUGE menu with always something new to try. Always a go to spot in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the taste of the green salsa. Other then that the workers were rude and I wasn't able to get extra chips without paying"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! To bad I've come down with food poisoning because of it. We had the 3 taco plate, both beef, 1 shredded 1 ground beef. I had 2 of the 3 shredded beef tacos and it has hit me the worst. If you want to loose weight on a taco diet the painful way? Here's the place for you. If you don't like bodily fluids having an express route out of your body, stay away."}
{"text":"I arrived at 5:48 and ordered happy hour items. Got back in line again at 5:58 while the bratty girl was helping another customer. Went to order another order of the happy hour tacos because I realized I didn't order enough and she said it's 6:01 now and you can't get happy hour. Not only did I arrive before the end of happy hour, but I was in line ready to order before the end of it. I told her to just forget it and if my other order hadn't been made already I would have just asked for a refund and left. She just walked away and went to the back. This was my first time here and it really left a bad taste in my mouth. Then I received my two orders of nachos and there was barely any cheese at all on them, just a plate of chips with toppings. I ordered the steak tacos and they were almost inedible. The steak was horribly over cooked. The didn't melt the cheese inside the bean and cheese burritos and it was just shredded cold cheese. Also, on the menu board above the registers, its shows certain prices for happy hour, but they charged me 25cents more each item. Not a big deal, but they shouldn't be advertising a certain price and then charging more than that. I will never come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few time before but was thoroughly disappointed tonight as I placed an order to go and got home to realize that they didn't have my entire order in the bags. I called them immediately as it was close to closing time to ensure that I was able to return to get my food and the girl who answered the phone acted as if this was no big deal and her reply was \"oh yeah, it's here\". No apology or anything. To top this off my wife orders a taco salad that ended up to have little to no lettuce. I suggest not going here close to closing time as the young people who work here are eager to go home and don't seem to care so much about the customer. Not sure that we will ever go back again after this experience. I don't typically write these reviews but I was really frustrated after this experience!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the carne was good but mine had a couple fatty/chewy pieces that I thought were kinda icky. My husband have his a 4/5. The green chile cheese tamale was flavorless. We could taste Ny. Hole or cheese. Salsas were pretty good but if spice isn't your thing, they have a kick. 

We should've asked but had already sat down when my husband said we are charged $22. 2 burritos with a couple added toppings, one tamale and 2 drinks. Unless they drink were $4 each, we were over charged."}
{"text":"High quality meat and ingredients, great prices, and great service. I enjoyed my food and enjoyed that I didn't have to spend a lot to still get great quality. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it is lacking flavor. The food is bland, and without spices. Ordered 5 different tacos, nachos, and 2 different burritos and were all bland. All in all I would recommend Tacos N More."}
{"text":"When this place opened, and up until the end of last year, this place was my favorite, I came here at least once a week. Now, the service isn't as friendly, you have to pay for chips, and I feel like the food isn't as good as it used to be. I'm not sure what happened, but it's disappointing. I had originally written a five star review!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall on higley road. I was thinking when I first saw it this place may or may not be good. Turns out it's pretty awesome. The food is great the set up is nice. The salsa bar is yummy. The burritos are very good and they offer a lot of options. Also the breakfast is bomb!!!! Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, AVOID IT AT ALL COST.... horrible service.. we ordered carna asada fries and it was a mess. Processed nacho cheese and the steak was awful. I can't even eat it. 

My daughter ordered 2 tacos one beef and chicken and half way through the beef taco she said she was done and that it was my fault we should have went to filabertos. I agreed and tossed the food in the trash"}
{"text":"Cheese sauce.  Not cheese, cheese sauce.  Burnt carne asada and pink Carne asada in the same burrito. They couldn't even make my daughter's quesadilla properly.  This place is to be avoided."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Tacos N More..since it is right around the corner from my house! Ordered some take out yesterday. BIG MISTAKE!....the food was terrible. The reviews on here are really mixed...and I do not get some of the 3 and 4 star ratings. The steak was hardly edible, so much fat and gristle. Salsas were so watered down. Also not the most pleasant staff to deal with when ordering! Won't be going back, and I'll be surprised if this place is still open a few months from now!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pazole was awesome and had a lot of meat in it, the nachos were good, and the best thing about this place...$16 for a dozen tamales! The tamales are huge and cheaper than most places that sell them frozen. I love this place and will continue to sing their praises"}
{"text":"First visit, 4 stars. Keep in mind, I'm rating this based on the expectations of what it really is... Mexican FAST FOOD, not a true sit down restaurant.  That being said...

The place has decent decor, with a couple tv's playing what ever game is on. The place is clean.  The girls working the counter were nice, and actually SMILED! When taking a to go order, they still offer you chips and salsa. The salsa bar has the usual green, red, Pico, limes, etc.  The prices were right in line with Fili-B's.

First visit, I got their carne asada fries with errthang on them, and a couple shrimp tacos. ...and now the reason for the 4 stars. The meat on the fries actually tasted grilled, even a lil Smokey! Not oily and old like most of the fast food spots out there. The shrimp tacos were ok. Not good , not bad, but ok. 

I will go back. Next time, I hope to try their red chili as well as their beans and rice. I'll update my review then. 

So, if you're looking for a quick taco or burrito in the area, this place gets the thumbs up from me. ... You know, a total stranger who is recommending a place for you to eat. Take it for what it is, and happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday after seeing the online reviews. Had the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito with everything in it. It was DELICIOUS!!! Chorizo was spicy and had tons of flavor. Burrito was huge and actually made two meals for me. Hubby had the carne asada burrito enchilada style with everything and he loved it. Said the carne asada was actually better quality then most places and the burrito was delicious. Salsas were yummy. Restaurant was very clean and staff was friendly. Definitely will go back to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Love the pico & shredded beef burrito!  Chips are fresh and everything is super awesome!"}
{"text":"Awful, Mom and I tried this dump on Tuesday.  The food was tasteless mystery meat, and the restaurant was nasty."}
{"text":"So excited for another Mexican food place to open in my hood. Coke products, check. Awesome salsa/hot sauce, check. Tasty bean & cheese burritos & quesadillas, check. Hubby is loving the variety of their menu, which includes lengua tacos & meatball soup (as you can probably tell, he's a little more adventurous with his food than I am), and he loved both. The prices are a little high IMHO, but otherwise 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the food is here. I didn't expect it to be authentic mexican,but the food was great. I like having options and that's how their set-up is. Much better prices than other places. I've had breakfast burritos twice here and plan to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Tacos aren't bad they were good not outstanding.Pozle was horrible one of the worst I have had meat tasted old and the over all flavor not good;(("}
{"text":"As far as authentic Mexican food in Gilbert, this place has the best choices. I got the usual taco plate the way it should come, with cilantro and onions and some Horchata. The Horchata has a nice cinnamon flavor in it and the steak is prepared well. They have a nice little \"salsa bar\" where you can grab salsa, pickled onions, extra cilantro and onion, limes, etc. 

The only thing I wish was that the tacos would be larger but it's probably a good thing because I'm a glutton and this is keeping me in check.  This will be my go to spot close to home when I need a quick authentic taco fix and don't want to drive an hour to get it."}
{"text":"Best Tamales Ever!! Definitely 5 star, great food, nice atmosphere, coming back for sure !"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.  Not sure about some of the complaints with waiting.  I called and ordered take out, showed up right when they said to and it was ready.   Seemed like the kid at the counter was new but the place is new so it's kind of expected.   Also, the price complaints?  I mean it's not the bell.  We paid $15 for a burrito 3 tacos and nachos.  I feel like that's pretty normal.   The burrito was awesome.  The tortillas here are great.  I didn't like the hard shell taco, but my wife got soft ones and hers were good so go with those.  The hard shell ones taste and look store bought.  We will definitely be back.  I'd say I worry a little about the place because they don't advertise clearly and it's a huge space for a taco joint."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but their service is one of the slowest around. Just 3 tacos + 1 burrito and it took 30 minutes. Not the cheapest either. Also, we were given stale chips.....grrrr."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, & yummy! I saw a few reviews of people complaining about service, just want to state that this is not a sit down service type place. You order at a counter, get your drink from a soft drink station, get your own salsa, and they bring food out to you, not a whole lot of service to be had. Nothing fancy but when I need a quick, cheap meal this does the trick!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars. DO NOT EAT HERE! What a horrible experience my mom and I had last night. We ordered 3 taco combos for dinner. When we went to pick it up. They had given our order to another lady. They explained what had happened and said fresh tacos were being made right away. Which is 100% alright. Mistakes happen, understandable. UNTIL the women who got our order came back for her correct food. They gave her her order and proceeded to hand us the bag of cold taco combos this women had just returned... You gave a person our order. They went home, opened the food up. Noticed it was wrong. And returned it. What makes you think ANY person would want to pay and eat returned food. We got a refund and found dinner else where. I'm disgusted with the way this establishment handles business. I have a strong urge to report this to the Health Department."}
{"text":"Below is my original 5 star review. Unfortunately since then their service has slowed to a snail's pace, the food isn't the same quality, and they raised prices. Too bad. 

Great burritos and bowls, good service and reasonable prices. Our favorite Gilbert fast Mexican place :)"}
{"text":"Great tacos al pastor and carnitas! Delicious and not expensive, will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Used to be really good. The food is still tasty,but they got rid of the Coke Freestyle machine and are charging for the chips (that weren't ever really that good unless they were free). It's too bad. It was a really great place, but they are outpricing themselves now and are probably slowly on their way out unless they go back to their old ways. The place was like a ghost town when I had lunch here today and every other time it was ALWAYS packed. I guess I am not the only one that feels cheated this time coming in. I understand business is business and I hope they read these reviews and see they have made a mistake with these changes. I won't be coming back, which is unfortunate because until now it was one of my favorite places to eat and to take people.  I wish them the best."}
{"text":"We were in the area after shopping at Lowe's and ordered take out. 
We ordered 2 breakfast burritos, 3 taco plate, and a taco salad for the family and it was delicious! All the food was fresh, hot, and very authentic.

The place is very causal and I think very reasonably priced. You shouldn't come here to expect fine dining, but you definitely visit for the food.

This is our go-to place in SE Gilbert area for Mexican take-out... keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went there a quarter after after they open hoping to get a decent meal.The Breakfast burritos where sub par eggs where really brown in my burro not rolled properly all my inside was falling on my plate. Machaca meat was dry seems like last night reheats. I expected better especially if we were the the second table that came in when they opened. Salsa bar is good the highlight  of the experience. Oh by the way now they charge you for chips now.. bummer"}
{"text":"Save yourself and your wallet; avoid this over price placed. Would've been better off going next door to the dollar store and getting a bag of cat food."}
{"text":"Well I can't really say... I have been there 2 times and had to ask for my money back due to it being 30 minutes or more from ordering. First time I ordered the nachos and second time the shrimp cocktail. Second time management signed my receipt for 10$ off next visit. So will definitely need to give them a third chance. 
When you walk in and order your food at a counter prior to sitting down you figure the food will will out quickly. So I look forward to trying them when I have 1 plus hours to spare."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  The chips and salsa were tasty and spicy.  We loved how the carnitas had little fat on it.. Most places will just serve mostly fat, we got 100% meat.  It's our new favorite place to go and take out of towners looking for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Sadly, I must update my review. I have been here three more times after my initial review and all three times waited exponentially longer than the time I was told. On this last occasion the lady on the phone told me 20 mins so I left my house after twenty minutes, arriving five minutes after that. I went in, gave her my name and they said it would be right out. I sat down. I watched three people come in, place their order, and walk out with their food. I went to yhe counter and asked about my food. She left to go in the back and said it wasn't ready yet. I gave her a look of bewilderment as it had been about 40-45 mins since I placed my order. I sat back down. TEN MINUTES later, she brings me my food and tells me she's sorry it took so long. That my order had actually been ready for a while and was sitting in a place she didn't know to look. Needless to say food was WET from condensation, cold, and less than UNsatisfactory. So sad. I wanted to like this place!
What did I order? Five tacos and a torta."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop by and try this place out. My daughter got a bean burrito and my husband and I got the pork carnitas tacos. The food was good. The service was fast and friendly. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Carne asada is outstanding! Great flavor and quality. But you'll be cheating yourself if you don't get at least one Green Chile Cheese Tamale! So good!
As to the reviews about service, I have been here 3 times and every time they have been very friendly. Food comes out hot and FRESH! Plus, while you wait you get free chips and salsa bar. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience and the food is great. The carne asada burrito ie my favorite."}
{"text":"For quick casual good and inexpensive try Tacos and More two at Queen Creek and Higley. Between the Lowes and Goodwill. They make your food to order and whether you are dining in or taking out you get a basket of chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Beer, wine and margaritas available. We go often."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was good. 
Was as in used to be. 
Can't believe the quality of the food has gone down so much. So prefabricated and bland now. Our enchiladas were tiny and microwaved!  They were a joke. Not just really small but really small, boring, and they microwaved them so long they had a dried up ring of sauce around the plate. My hard shell taco was NOT authentic at all. They are using preformed Housewife taco shells from the grocery store. Will wait a year and try again."}
{"text":"Honestly thought this place was small and no one was here at first glance , but its actually spacious and nice inside. To my surprise, there was a lot of people inside and the food is good.

Salsas could be better, the carne asada burrito with everything was pretty good, better than most but not the best. Menudo needed to be cooked with more salt (adding salt after is not the same) and a spicier salsa would be great for a nice flavor kick.

Overall we like the place. They have fast and friendly service. Glad we tried it, it is super close to our house so we will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Good rule of thumb is if you can wrap your fingers of one hand around your burrito and they touch then you've got yourself one cheap taco shop. The food wasn't bad, but not memorable either. I waited about 20+ minutes for a takeout order on Sunday afternoon. Bummer cause it is pretty close to home."}
{"text":"Those of you who had a less than perfect experience should give it another shot.  I have eaten here more than a dozen times now since they opened and it is delicious!  They are so generous with their great condiment bar that has delicious salsas, fresh cilantro and limes.  The food is fresh and tastes outstanding.   A few times when busy it has been a little slower or the order a little mixed up, but I feel this is understandable as they have just opened and are getting everything organized.  The staff is friendly and always working diligently to make the customers happy."}
{"text":"I got a carne asana burrito and it was pretty dope. The workers are kind, and there was not much of a wait time after ordering my food."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. Both times we ordered to go, both times the food was really good. 

Tonight we waited a short wait for our food. Walking out the door I even commented that it was pretty fast. It's our anniversary but we just wanted to eat a relaxed meal at home with our baby. When we got home we opened up our food... To realize it was not at all what we ordered. I called the restaurant and was told they already knew the girl had given us the wrong order. I asked if they needed to know what we had ordered and they said no they actually had our food there. I wasn't super happy about the idea of our food being over an hour old by the time my husband would be able to pick up our order and get back home with it but I'm non confrontational and the girl who answered the phone wasn't super friendly so I didnt want to get into it with her. Plus... You just don't tick off people who come in contact with your food. 

I expected when my husband got there they'd offer him a free soda or something for the trouble. He got home, seeming slightly annoyed (he's a sweet man and it's hard to annoy him). They didn't offer a thing. Really? I mean if I'm gonna end up driving 24 miles to get there and back TWICE and spend $22 on cold food because you messed up... You should try to offer some kind of compensation or a sincere apology. I probably wouldn't have even left a review if the employees had. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Establishment is clean, food is fresh and hot. Loaded burrito with carne asada was tasty. Fried jalapenos were hot! yum."}
{"text":"Disappointing is all I can say.  My husband and I just happened to be driving by and decided to stop in for lunch.  Decor is very bright and pleasant.  A nice salsa bar with several choices, however, the pico de gallo and mild salsa were extremely bland, no salt, tang or heat at all.  The chips were free, but almost chewy instead of crisp.

My husband ordered the ceviche tostada (good) and the pozole (passable), mine was a little worse.  I ordered the three item combo so I could sample a few things to get a better idea of the food.  The green chile and cheese tamale was flavorless, lots of thick masa with canned green chiles in the middle and no cheese I could find.  The beef taco on a hard shell was unseasoned pot roast on a soggy taco shell, and the cheese enchilada arrived cold with a very thick red sauce.  The refried beans were unpleasantly pasty instead of smooth and creamy and, again, unseasoned and the rice had no flavor or seasoning at all (there seems to be a pattern here with the cooks not seasoning or tasting the food going out)

Price for this was $20 without any drinks (water only) so not terrible price wise, but considering the poor flavor and quality it was not worth it.  Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but I focus 50% of my opinion on service. The cashier wasn't very nice, she interpreted my pausing and reading the menu as an inability to manage the English language, then she switched to Spanish, which was low level to say the least. When someone acts condescending towards me as a customer that's enough for me not to go back. The worst was when I sent a message on their website and they never responded. That star is really a zero star."}
{"text":"I tried the carne asada burrito for lunch and it was OK. Not bad, just not Great. I went back on a different occasion and got a chorizo breakfast burrito that was scrumptulescent!  So role the dice & give 'em a try."}
{"text":"If you go for breakfast burritos or lunch this place is great but later in the evening their food tastes reheated and their chips are stale. It's a little disappointing because we used to eat here a lot..."}
{"text":"Sadly, I was going to give 3 stars, the food tastes wonderful, but, shortly after leaving there, both my son and I got violently sick. I will spare details, but it was not the flu. No return trip for this family!
We had eaten the ground beef, my wife did not."}
{"text":"With so many killer options in the valley for Mexican food, this place is good.   It won't blow your mind, but its good."}
{"text":"I too ended up here because New Mexican Grill was closed on Sunday. I was looking for something a step up from the chains.  The place is nice inside. Plenty of tables. Mostly clean. My daughter got the chicken nachos. Portion and price - I'd give a 5. But I give the dish a 3. The guacamole was boring. It had a nice big heaping scoop on it too. Maybe next batch! My other daughter got the carne asada burrito. huge. She cut it in half. She rated it OK. Her favorite is a burrito from a chain. I will say that she ate her entire half which was the equivalent size of a full size at the chain. So, leftovers! I got the loaded burrito with green sauce. It's true as the other reviews said. The sauces have kick--I love it! The green sauce is creamy. I am not sure if it was the sight or size of my burrito but I was only able to eat a quarter. It felt like woman vs food. But I give my dish a 5. Their hot salsa is awesome too. It was way too hot for the kids. And I'll have to order the nachos without pico de gallo for my daughter next time....at least until she acquires the taste for heat. My leftovers were incredible for lunch, I think a 5+ on the second day. I still have half a burrito to go for my dinner now....I'm eager to try Tacos N More for breakfast next!"}
{"text":"Just witnessed a customer blackmail a poor young lady named Kayla for a refund. After three people sat down and ate all their food to the last bite .. They Then complained about being completely dissatisfied with their food because their beans were running and cold. Kayla apologize profusely , offered many different options for the customers and did great. The customer wanted a refund in Lou of going online and posting bad reviews. Then after Kayla refunded the money the lady made the comment I quote \"I made that money\" to her group. People always need to be aware of the scammers out there taking advantage of social media."}
{"text":"Love this place... best build your own burritos in town... I drive all the way from Scottsdale just to get one!!"}
{"text":"Seen this place for months but never tried it.  Nothing about the exterior looked appealing and the name certainly lacks any creativity.  We finally had the opportunity to try it and we were very impressed.  Great interior design, visually appetizing menu and good prices.  We were all happy with our meals and look forward to further adventures on the menu."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait 45 minutes for 3 burritos!!! Oh and it'll also cost you a small fortune. 

This place was great when it first opened but it has gone down hill. Hoping the business reads the reviews and makes some changes."}
{"text":"Decent place for a taco. Not my go to but they have good hours and prices are reasonable. I seem to always have to wait longer than I expect based on the one or two people in there in the mornings."}
{"text":"Biggest star is for uber delivery service--burritos in bed on a Sunday, yes please!!! We got three breakfast burritos, two fully loaded with beans, peppers and onions and potatoes. These were a pretty good size and the peppers and onions were nicely cooked, big chunks too. My son just likes a plain burrito with eggs, meat, and cheese. This burrito was laughably small in comparison to the other two. Should've taken a pic but he had it down in two bites. I get it, he didn't get a lot of toppings, but add more eggs or something. I guess we are used to other restaurants obnoxiously huge burritos. Glad we didn't split them! I also would've appreciated the sauce I requested, but that didn't end up in the bag. Ah well. Like I said, glad we have a place that delivers breakfast now, but it could be way better."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT!! Been here now 3 times and always satisfied with the food.  The service on the other hand, People its tacos how long can it take. 2x now only person in the place , still took them 15 mins to make 6 tacos."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat. I ordered a combination. Those chile rellanos were so good. It's a little pricey coming from California, but I would recommend this place to eat. It's also clean and love the music Ramon Ayala."}
{"text":"Disappointed lately with the quality of the food. The carne asada meat quality has gone down. Grizzly meat and the taste is subpar. Unfortunate because i really liked this place and its close to home. Also the size of the burritos has shrunk for the same price."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night for a quick family dinner.  The service was GREAT and the food delicious.  We had quite a variety: taco salad, nachos grande, quesadilla, steak tacos and chicken tacos.  It was all very tasty and the Coke machine is a bonus.  We will eat there again and refer our friends."}
{"text":"If you like spicy chorizo burritos this is your PLACE! breakfast was out of this world and so cheap!!! Loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and have been eating here 2-3 times a week now! Love the carne asada tacos and burritos! Torte and fries are yummy too. Always super nice service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"As far as I know, they cook lengua right, their red hot salsa are actually spicy and delicious.  The tacos are simply- only shredded lettuce and cheese, no sour cream , no guacamole, but they're tasty. Always ordered 10 tacos to-go. But gotta say that to-go plating is sloppy, not ideal for taking any foodie photos. Occasionally we have to eat the tacos as \"salad\" and corn totilla ."}
{"text":"While I love supporting local business this place left me feeling unsure.  While the tacos were good I do have some suggestions.  

First off don't judge this book by its cover. It is very unassuming from the upside and the \"Huge\" we're open sign in the window lets me believe they must be struggling for customers.  Once inside you can tell the owners have put a lot of money into making it a nice place.  It is very clean and the salsa bar was a nice touch.

As far as the food..I have hear from multiple people that their Carna Asada is very fatty (they must not trim the meat) so I steered clear.  I have the three taco place with ground beef hard shell tacos.  Immediately I was a bit disappointed as the shells were notate from scratch but store bought taco shells.  While the flavor was good I was left desiring more.  The rice and beans were standard so no complaints there.  Overall I could see myself eating here more out of convenience then actually going out f my way. It's a shame as  sure their overhead for the renovations must have been a lot.  Price also seemed a bit high but nothing crazy."}
{"text":"No major complaints here. Food was pretty good and the employees were very nice. Could be cheaper though..."}
{"text":"Seemed like a typical fast food type taco joint.  The portions are very big, which I like!  All of the food we ordered was good.  The food came out at different times, which is why I gave this three stars and not four stars.  I ended up eating my huge burrito in front of everyone who just got done eating and I could tell were ready to leave.  I had the Pastor Burrito and it was very good.  The group I was with ordered chips and salsa and it was a little disappointing.  The salsa cups are 1/4 the size of a dixie cup and there weren't a large portion of chips.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  She was very young and was working her tale off taking orders and serving."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times and love it. I also like that it's locally owned. The salsa is great, and they give you chips if you dine-in. I get the three taco combination and have gotten a variety of kinds of tacos, all were great - especially like the shrimp taco!"}
{"text":"Average.  I've had worse.  Had a carne asada burrito. I would try something different to see if it was me or their food."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos are the best you can find in Gilbert. Highly recommend the tamales as well. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.
Ordered al a carte : 3 rolled tacos ( shredded beef) 
Came with a bit of shredded lettuce, grated cheese and a small sour cream and guacamole.
They do carry bags of hot carrots/ jalapeños located near the register. Each bag is .49 cents.
EVERYDAY- between 7 & 9 AM they offer a free coffee with a purchase of a breakfast burrito.
Plus side a salsa bar. However, red medium is canned tomorrow with a few spices. They have a red hot- it's hot! Green is just average in flavor, pretty watery. They have a fresh Pico, lime wedges, radishes and fresh chopped cilantro. 
The rolled tacos were skinny & over fried. Meat was in turn over cooked and tough inside. 
Guacamole was bland.
Plus side: offer a lot of options. Dine in or
Take Out. Clean restaurant & restrooms. 
Unfortunately, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I order the chicken taco salad and it was sooo good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very spicy sauces but a little cafeteria-like. The food is tasty though. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The rice tasted just like my Nanas and the service was excellent! Found my new obsession."}
{"text":"Been waiting for them to open since they were giving out promotional samples one afternoon in November.
We tried the loaded nachos, chicken burritos, and quesadilla. All tasty and just the right amount of burn.
They have a Coke Freestyle machine for variety.

We will return often!"}
{"text":"Yummy, bean and cheese burritos!!
My sister said the taco salad was delicious.
Fast and friendly service . Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"We got breakfast here this morning, we got two burritos and a steak and egg plate to go and an 8 ounce side of guacamole. We paid $30, and left a $4 tip as well. For $34 dollars we got a burrito with a huge egg shell inside of it that made me gag while I was eating, a steak that was super super fatty and dry, eggs that were brownish and not at all fluffy, and an 8 ounce guacamole side that was dark brown on the top and sides. We also had asked for extra cheese on the burrito with the shell - and we could barely see or taste any! 

The second burrito didn't have any issues. It's really sad that we paid $34 for really low quality food that wasn't cooked right or was prepared the day before (browned guacamole).

When we were done eating we all agreed that it was horrible and we only ate it because we were hungry. 

Lastly, $34 dollars and we have to scoop our own salsa into cups and put lids on our self? You can pre-make  sides of guacamole so far in advance that it turns brown - but you can't pre-make sides of salsa which has a longer shelf life? Things that make you go hmmmm.....

After reading all the reviews on here, it seems ownership is very worried about pinching pennies and puts that above good service and high food quality. It's all makes sense now and we will not be back here. I hope I don't get food poisoning. :-/

This place should be avoided at all cost!"}
{"text":"We ate here and thought the salsa was good it certainly wasn't super incredible but it was pretty darn good"}
{"text":"1st visit for sit down, normally get to go. Service was ehh. You order at countet self serve drink and food is brought to you.  I have always had the Mexican hot dog. Best in the area. Bacon wrapped dog ketchup, mayo, mustard. Toasted bun and onions on top. Did try the cheese crisp for the $5 not worth it! Will continue to get the dog not sure about much else."}
{"text":"Great Taco & Burrito place! Selection is great & has an awesome atmosphere. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Tamales are amazing !! The green chili and cheese are my favorite , great food all around ."}
{"text":"Always great food.  Prices went up but unfortunately service went down.  Twice in a row not the best service, cashier was texting in the middle of us ordering.  Having to repeat same order twice to get it right.  Hopefully it turns around."}
{"text":"Overall a good place to go and eat some quality food. Happy hour specials were pretty good with $2 beers, the service was friendly, prompt, and accurate. Three things that are apparently hard these days so props to the staff for that.

The chips and salsa bar was a good deal, with fresh made salsa to try. The tamales are also very good and better than what I was expecting. The burritos were cooked well, rolled nicely and didn't fall apart. 

The rice and beans was above average and had good flavor. On par with some of the better Mexican chains around town and far superior to filibertos. 

Would send friends here if they ask for a solid SE valley choice."}
{"text":"Update! This was our second time excited to eat here again. We ordered shrimp tacos, shrimp burritos, and kids Mac n cheese. All were absolutely pitiful. It was the nastiest shrimp burrito I've ever had. Even my 15 year old said her food was disgusting. We will probably not be back. It's too unpredictable!! 

This restaurant is clean and is decorated nicely. The cashier was kind and patient,  answering all of our questions. The food is served on real plates, not styrofoam or out of a take out box. The salsa bar was great and my enchiladas with steak were fantastic. The red sauce was grainy, thick, earthy, and amazing just like it should be! The menudo was just ok. Everything did need a bit of extra salt. The extensive selection of authentic Mexican food items was impressive. All in all, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I wish it was not so far from my house! One of the best taco joint I have stumbled across yet! Delicious chips and salsa and tacos were amazing! Extremely reasonable price! Very clean restaurant! The staff were very friendly and accommodating! The wait was not very long either and it makes it easier that they give you a basket of free chips and salsa from the salsa bar while you wait! I will be back if I find myself on this side of town again!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner last night. I finally found a place that makes Agua Chiles! So I had to get that! Plus I did the carne asada burrito fully loaded. I liked how it wasn't a monster burro and enough for one person. I also liked how you got all the I ingredients in one bite and every bite. 
Salsa bar was a nice touch. The cabbage was brown so that needed some improvement. But Like the previous reviewer said, mix the hot and mild and it's the perfect Chunky salsa with a kick. 
Husband ordered the shrimp burro. Warning:the secret sauce has mustard flavor. Didn't expect that in a shrimp burro. Typically they have a chipotle cream or some kinda creamy sauce. Surprisingly it actually tasted good!! Just a shock. Lol
They have a great variety and very clean. Wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal!! Best authentic Mexican food I've had in phoenix. Burritos are  definitely would recommend and go back"}
{"text":"Not that impressed with the food. Service was good, and the place was clean. I ordered my usual shredded beef taco and a bean and cheese burrito. Neither impressed me. Price was good, but I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in today on a whim. 
The crew there was awesome. Great customer service. Smiling faces and just a nice environment. 
We had a beer and some guacamole. Awesome awesome
We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This a great, affordable restaurant for families and people looking for a yummy meal! The food is very tasty and the atmosphere reminds me so much of Mexico! The prices are are great. There is a huge selection to choose from. They have beers and margaritas as well! Definitely not a fancy place.... But you'll leave satisfied!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Tacos N More catered for my team luncheon and the food was delicious. The green enchiladas tasted awesome. The pork and chicken street tacos were excellent. I really enjoyed the rice and beans."}
{"text":"Tacos n more is amazing! The rice is the best rice in the world. I also love the tacos, chimichangas & taquitos as well as the guacamole. The green salsa is fire. The good fire not the spicy fire. Unless you like the spicy fire. I would eat this everyday."}
{"text":"Food is down right smackkkin I add French fries to the carne and it's a good call. I heavily recommend to all ages"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast burrito, and Tacos N More does them right! Fresh and tasty tortillas are a great starting point. Sausage is very tasty, and i really like the potatoes they use: crispy outside, soft inside. They also offer bacon and choriso.  A salsa bar compliments the free chips they give you at the register, and the salsas are very flavorful. Lastly, the service was prompt and friendly, and the team keep this place clean, which i appreciate! 

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot. Bad idea. I appreciate the complimentary chips that accompany each order, but they are terribly stale and salty! Yuck! The salsa bar is unimpressive, although I did appreciate that cilantro was available. The enchiladas are still nasty (barely any filling, gross cheese, and dry sauce), and the employees are so blah (smile, darn it!). I will not be giving this place a third try. Adiós!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast burritos. Was rushed through order and the burritos were not impressive. Eggs were hard and tortilla was hard. 

Won't go back."}
{"text":"Got the taco salad with chicken..perfect, taste great couldn't have made it better..good service and food came put in a timely manner since it was the lunch rush..will go back if in area"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and have very high standards, even for the \"fast food\"Mexican places.  And this place rocked my world.  This was my first time here.  My wife and I had loaded steak burritos, chips and drinks for $20.  Chips were homemade.  Tortillas were homemade.  Salsa was amazing.  Steak was deliciously seasoned.  Great guacamole.  This is my new go-to place for Mexican.  Love it!!  Can't wait to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"I don't write Yelp reviews very often but I am compelled to do so today. I won't ramble on too long with rhetoric and get to the point...the worst enchiladas I have had in a lifetime of eating Mexican food on the SW border. I really wish I had taken a picture, but three street taco sized tortillas that must have been bought from the bottom shelf at Wal-Mart, placed in the microwave with a smidgin of cheese and bitter canned enchilada sauce ladled over the top. The sauce was bright red like no sauce I have ever seen. The rice had been sitting out all day and the grains we're dried to crisp and discolored. No joke, no embellishment here...cold hard nastiness. Oh and the salsa bar...gingo inspired at best. Last time I checked pico de gallo wasn't supposed to be green and salsa isn't supposed to come from a can. Bad bad bad and shame shame shame. Never again for us folks, too bad as the area has a restaurant deficit and needs good places to eat. Maybe other things on the menu are more palatable, but we'd be afraid to gamble to find out. Maybe a little quality control by the ownership would repair the lack of effort or maybe a cook that cares...I don't know.   yuk!"}
