{"text":"I went for dinner on a weeknight. The service was incredibly slow, and the restaurant was only one-third full. It took 30 minutes just to get my appetizer, and then the quality of the food was not very good. My mulligatawny soup had no chicken in it.  Even worse, it was chock full of (defrosted) frozen peas. It was also surprisingly oily for a soup with no meat.  The chicken tikka masala was fair fare, but too creamy for my tastes. The chicken was also not very tender."}
{"text":"We visited Priya restaurant  today with the hope of tasting good Indian food. Glad to say our expectations were exceeded. The manager ( FEROZ) was extremely friendly and helpful.  The place was nice and  clean, the staff were very courteous. The food was authentic south Indian. The uthapam, Idly and  variety of chutneys ( mint,  coconut and tamarind) were excellent. The tandoori chicken  was flavorful  and yummy. The rasam  was as good as any you would have at a south Indian home for lunch. All the curries were uniformly excellent (my favorite was the kerala style fish curry). There was wonderful variety of veg and non veg meals  (gobi manchurian,  veg fried rice, chicken briyani,  egg curry, carrot and peas poriyal, spinach pakora, mutter panneer etc.). It was a very good deal for $13 per person.   The only issue i had was that the desserts were too sweet for my liking. A special  note of thanks to Feroz.  We went to the restaurant with our 7 month old son and had some trouble getting a cab ride back to our place. He arranged some one to drop us at our place  which was totally out of the  way. Thanks for that. Look forward to visiting this place on a regular  basis."}
{"text":"\"Weird as hell\" is how I would describe our dining experience at the lunch buffet. To say that the service was poor would  imply that there was any. When we first arrived for lunch, no one greeted us, even though several people walked in and out of the back kitchen area. Finally I walked up to the kitchen opening and called out \"hello! hello!\" A man in a t-shirt and jeans walked out, seemed a little flustered by our presence, and then pointed to some tables for us.   After sitting down with our food (see description below), we noticed there wasn't any water. There also wasn't any service staff. When we finally saw the t-shirt and jeans man walk out of the kitchen we called to him and asked for water, at which point he did a double take, apparently overwhelmed by this request. A few minutes later, a young girl in t-shirt and jeans who appeared to be about 15 yrs old, emerged with a plastic pitcher of lukewarm tap water with 3 ice cubes floating in it. Thankfully we remembered we had bottled water in the car.   We had to wait so long for the girl to re-emerge that we gave up and got paper towels from the bathroom upon realizing that there were no napkins on the table.  The food selection was sad: 2 of the 8 or so dishes were comprised of watery broth with a couple of carrots floating in it. One dish was fried baby corns that had been dyed red. Thoroughly unappetizing, even less so than the watery broths. Another dish was the Tikka Marsala sauce that usually one finds chicken in, but this one had none, this dish was called \"butter sauce.\" There was a fish curry which was surprisingly decent, and tandoori chicken (ok). These were the only 2 protein choices. There were not even any lentil dishes! The naan, idli and orange slices were all that kept us from going completely hungry.  I would be entirely unsurprised to learn that this place was actually a drug or gambling front."}
{"text":"Our server was great, and the food was delicious. Indian food is always rich in flavor, but this had more depth than we tend to get around here. We got the Appolo Fish and Lamb Rogan Josh, and we'll definitely be going back for it again."}
{"text":"My husband, who is south Indian, is addicted to this place. He insists we go here almost every weekend. Fortunately, the food is great, so I usually agree. At lunch they have a full buffet, usually a little bigger and fancier on the weekends. It includes an assortment of appetizers (always a pakora), tandoori chicken, usually a couple of other chicken or fish curries, biryani (usually chicken), and lots of vegetarian options. I'm pretty crazy about the okra. Usually the least appealing item on the menu is the dal, but they're forgiven that because Priya specializes in south Indian cooking and dal is traditionally a north Indian dish, so it's not really their *thing*. (BTW, for the uninitiated, the majority of Indian restaurants in the US offer north Indian dishes, so you'll get to try some fun and different things at Priya.) After you're seated and eating a waiter will come and offer you a Masala Dosa, which is a bit like a crepe with a potato/ onion/ spices filling. This is included in the price of the buffet but made to order, so treat yourself and try one. Get a small bowl of Sambar from the buffet to dip the Dosa in as you eat it.   Overall, the selection and quality of the food is outstanding for the price. Don't be scared off by the sketchy looking strip mall where it's located. The inside of the restaurant is nice and they usually have flatscreen TVs playing Bollywood music videos, which can be quite entertaining."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is closed/shut down. We tried calling them too. But call was not complete. Address also can't be spotted on GPS."}
{"text":"Good place to go for, if you are really looking for cold food! And of course not to forget the extra ordinary 'sweet' mutton, chicken and paneer curry in the buffet along with almost stale and dry biryani. Gave 4ratings so that it will show up as 'recommended' reviews and will save someone.... Deserved rating=1"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable service. If only they could make it look better. I would go back here again. Rightly flavored and rightly spiced. They probably need to fine tune their service a little and make the interiors look better. But clearly if your focus is food, among the better places for Indian food."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am disappointed (based on my last two visits). The first few times we went to have dinner (in mid 2012) the experience was great. The last two visits -once in Jan & once in Feb - both on week nights - We walked in around 6.30PM - prime dinner time.  We were the only ones in the restaurant. Then we realized that it was VERY cold inside. So, I walked past the thermostat and they have it set @ 60F !!! Really??? The greeter, server, manager - everyone was in their outdoor winter coats. Well, guess what - we had to eat with our coats on and rubbing our palms together every few minutes to keep warm.   Come on..you have to spend some money on heating the place before you can expect customers to feel welcome."}
{"text":"It's hard to make any legitimate comments because I think I had retrograde food-induced amnesia. In reality, I just don't know what the name of anything I ate was, except the chicken masala which was delicious.  Overall, yummy Indian food that I ate way too much of and immediately felt ashamed yet also oddly proud."}
{"text":"I visited several times to Priya in recent times ,the food is very authentic and cheaper too. Hospitality and service is good and we are happy with their food."}
{"text":"Food was cold on telling owner he said \"sorry temperature is cold can't help \" . Tastewise also not authentic indian desert was beead pudding ie bread dipped in condensed milk , not at all what we expected from indian buffet"}
{"text":"Good Ambiance, Great taste, and Excellent Service. Got Jain food (w/o onion, garlic etc. ) which is very rare. That is all one can expect!!"}
{"text":"I went with two of my friends and we all loved all the flavors in the buffet. The best tandoori chicken Ive ever had!! And the carrot dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I eat Indian food quite often and we've tried numerous restaurants close to home. The selection, food quality and taste at Priya is great. Fresh Naan and Dosa are brought to the table during the buffet. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed. We also came on a Christmas Day for the buffet and there was a huge feast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was good. The lunch buffet was apt.. not too many choices so you don't stuff your plate and your stomach. As far as the dinner goes, this place has some real good \"koththu parotta\". Try it.. you will like it too."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place and reviews said it was so awesome. Online their hours said open at 5:30. We arrived 5:50 and didn't mind waiting since we were told the buffet doesn't open until 6pm. Typically, when we think we want the buffet we like to look at it first but if we don't like what we see we'd rather order off the menu.   As we waited another gentlemen walked in and he was then escorted to the table first. He may have left and came back but it seemed a bit odd.   We were taken to our booth and it was assumed we wanted the buffet. No other offer was made and no menus were brought to the table. We would have liked a bit of a description of the food items. I only knew a little bit about this cuisine based on my own google research!   They brought water to the table and never asked if we wanted any other drink! This visit was starting to get on my nerves. We wanted to look at the buffet but even though they made all the patrons wait items were still missing. So, who could decide?  When they brought out the rice it was floating\levitating on a piece of seran wrap that was placed over the top of the stainless serving tray? why? This was just weird. Plus, numerous items were missing serving spoons!  The only meat on the buffet was some weirdly cutup chicken wings just drenched in sauce.   I do have to say the food we had, lentils, chutneys, sauces, rice, veggies, were tasty and fresh. Too bad we had no idea what it was except for the brief paper writing descriptions over them.  I cannot remember the price I want to say 12.99 for dinner buffet per person. I thought this was very pricey for a buffet with one meat that looked like it was hacked in a chicken coop!  I wont be back. Service was just too rude and lacked anything close to a comfortable experience. The noise was horrendous with the vent blowing, winding, and whistling the whole time. Even the 6 yr old behind us kept say daddy what's that noise?   Very strange place to visit. I'll have to actually go find the best indian food and place in Cleveland, OH THIS WAS NOT IT!   VERY DISAPPOINTED  P.S. I just looked at the menu we had taken as we left. Dinner buffet hours are 5pm to 10pm. Ya rite!  Skip this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a changed woman- I went to Indian Buffet by myself!  I'm not the kind of person to go out to eat alone, but I've been wanting to try this place for a while now.   I was only a few miles away on a lunch break, and it was probably the best option, too.    The buffet is pretty big- with about 6 vegetarian items and 5 dishes with chicken.  2 of the vegetarian items were with heavy creme, so a vegan might want to take a look first and maybe order off the menu.    When I got my first plate the waiter asked if I'd also like a Dosa.  I said NO. since there were already potatoes in a few of the veg dishes and I didn't have very long.  I'd like to come back for dinner buffet and get one though.    The lunch buffet was $9.99. which is average to expensive.  Some lunch buffets I've been to are $7.99 or $8.99, but I guess there's not a big difference.  The currys and dishes were pretty good, but not the best.  The chutnys all tasted very good, one of them was red and looked like Sriracha but it wasn't very spicy."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good.  The food was the right amount of spice and was pretty authentic to what South Indian cooking is.  Service was a little slow but I figured that was because I should up late in the night and it was certainly a slow weeknight.  I will probably try eating here again for their Indian breakfast."}
{"text":"OK, it pains me not to leave an outstanding view (usually the only reason I leave one is to praise a restaurant), but the service we had tonight, during our first visit, was so so very bad.  Conversely, the food, when we finally experienced it, was outstanding, but the \"front of house experience\" was just awful.  We chose to visit tonight because Sundays are supposed to be nights when they feature a dosa buffet.  We were greeted kind of reluctantly after we walked by two people chatting in the front and then one followed us to seat us.  \"We hear you have dosas tonight.\"  Answer-yes, then leaves.  We help ourselves to a few buffet items but don't eat a lot, excited for dosas. Nobody comes to check on us, explain anything, etc.  30 minutes and two plates later-when we realize no one is ever going to help us, and we don't even have napkins, we work a good 5 minutes to get the guy to our table...who is avoiding eye coontact...most likely because everyone is at sea.  Don't you have dosas tonight?  \"Yes, I forgot to give you a menu.\"  5 minutes later he drops one off and leaves the table....again.  We flag him down again to make our order, for two different dosas.  My friend gets hers 25 minutes later, mine never comes.  I flag him down again; \"remember.\"  No, he didn't.  They brought it another 10 minutes later, it was fantastic.  We were there two hours.  Had to flag him down for the bill.  Other people in the restaurant were struggling to get helped, too.  I hope they figure out how to take care of people because the food was really yummy."}
{"text":"The food here is so very good, I  just gave it 5 stars.   The masala paneer dosa is the most delicious dosa I've ever had. The very large dosa is stuffed with potatoes, paneer, and the perfect blend of spices. It was enough to be a meal but also great for sharing.  The aloo ghobi has a subtle smoky tomato flavor, big chunks of onions, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and cauliflower. I've had it twice and it is excellent. And oh my goodness, the rice! One would think, \"it's just plain rice\" but there is something about it that is just so good.  We ordered Saag with chickpeas. Also very very good. A nice blend of spinach, chickpeas, and spices. We loved the garlic naan.  The menu features North and South Indian dishes.    Great presentation and friendly prompt service.  They easily split our check upon request.  This gem is overlooked in a little strip mall in Parma. You must make the effort to stop here. This may be my new favorite place for Indian food."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at, and I've been to many different Indian restaurants around the world. Indian food is my favorite quisine. Authentic ambience, attentive service, quality food and value, spices like none other, and a great environment. With delicious food and reasonable prices, I rate this a 5-star restaurant, no question. Will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst buffet we have ever eaten.  We tried this place once before and ordered off the menu, and it was pretty decent.  Thought we'd give the buffet a try BIG MISTAKE. Cold food, no variety, terrible service. One star is honestly too generous."}
{"text":"how can you NOT a love a restaurant with a big, empty fountain with a giant fern sitting inside of it?  way to re-appropriate what once was...  anyways, i've been for both dinner and the lunch buffet, and the food was quite good each time.  for dinner, i had the lamb vindaloo.  the lamb was moist and succulent, but the sauce was just a bit too salty.  highlight of the dinner: chicken tikka naan...what?  that's right, chicken tikka naan.  i felt like i was sinning.  but oh, it was lovely.  the lunch buffet has mostly vegetarian options, and one or two desserts. many of the standards were present: tandoori chicken was very tender, biryani well-spiced.  however, i was disappointed that some of the dishes obviously had not been mixed in awhile, as they had that dry veneer that results from the heating lamp and lack of being mixed...delicious regardless, but...  the staff was friendly and quite attentive.  i definitely need to go back for the chaat buffet!"}
{"text":"Don't even go for this restaurant, it will spoil your taste for food. I had visited once along with my friends on Sunday afternoons for buffet. The first dish Cauliflower Pakoda itself was smelling horrible. Believe it or not it's like food poison."}
{"text":"Excellent tikka masala chicken. Interesting place.... Huge open restaurant in the middle of a run down strip mall.... I was one of three people eating on a Thursday evening around 6:30. Food was very good.... Seemed way too big a place for so few people eating, Imagine they must do a large lunch crowd and maybe catered events? Would definitely eat again"}
{"text":"I made the drive from Cleveland Heights to Parma for the Saturday Buffet. Usually with buffets, lower quality food is the price you pay for the huge variety. This was not the case at Priya. The food was phenomenal! It was really the best I've had in the Cleveland area! I was there with six Indian graduate students and they agreed.  The variety was great, with plenty of meat and vegetarian options. They brought fresh dosas to the table for everyone. And, the desserts tasted very fresh, as well.  The service was friendly and attentive. And, the manager or owner asked us several time how we liked the food. He also asked about the spice level, which we all assured him was hotter than anywhere else (a good thing in my book). The restaurant was clean and well lit with plenty of space to seat large groups."}
{"text":"Priya is one of our favorite Indian restaurants in the CLE area. Love their shahi paneer! Good south and north Indian food options. Not much ambience, but the service is friendly. The only complaint is that the party hall located next door could be blasting loud music during some weekends, which can be annoying at times. But give it a try for their delicious food!"}
{"text":"The general quality of the place has declined drastically over the past 3-4 months. The staff has changed and the current staff has no clue how to handle more than 2 tables.  I visited the restaurant the other day, and they took 35 mins to bring my main dish, and a further 15 mins to get the breads. They didn't even serve their usual paapad, claiming they were too busy to serve it! I'm still willing to give it another chance before finally giving up on it!"}
{"text":"I made my first visit trip here on a Tuesday evening. The place was a ghost town but I am fine with that. The waiter left a pitcher of water without ice on the table. The waitress wasn't that friendly either. My husband and I  both ordered the lamb rogan josh. It was really good. The lamb was very tender and the rice was cooked nicely. Also had a side order of garlic naan. That was also delicious. I am looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"The food here was good.  That's the sole reason for 3 of 5 stars.  Otherwise, not a great dining experience.  We got sat promptly and given menus, but it took a solid 20 minutes for anyone to come back to take our order even though they kept looking at us.  We also were given a pitcher of room temperature water.   The cleanliness of the restaurant is also very questionable.  We received one napkin for two of us and the napkin was already dirty.  Our paper placemats were also dirty, they had clearly been used by someone else.  Half our silverware was also filthy.  I was afraid to order a pop as to I was unsure the cleanliness of soda lines.  In the end the food was good and the chef did come out to make sure our food was good.  But the service is lacking and the lack of cleanliness is disturbing."}
{"text":"The food was OK. But I have reservations about giving it more than three stars.   1) my menu was so disgusting, I missed an entire 2 pages of menu options because it was bound together by a huge amount green sauce. Yuck!  2) the service was really slow  3) they charged us for things we did not order so I had to ask them to revise the bill   4) one of the dishes had no option to select a spice level. It just came out at an infernal hotness that was ultimately inedible so we left it behind. Holy tongue-numbness was it hot!  THE PLUSES  1) There's a good groupon for this so you can sample at a reasonable rate  2) the lamb vindaloo and lamb yellow curry dish were wonderful, according to my fam with better luck in selecting  3) I loved, loved, loved the sweet naan with raisins in it! Yum! We ordered a second helping  4) I really appreciate that for no extra charge, each entree came with a super generous helping of rice"}
{"text":"This place has really good food; we ate Chicken Tikka Masala, and Guthi Vankaya, along with some naan bread. The portions were quite generous. They also features some south Indian dishes on the menu, a rarity in Cleveland. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One star is for the arrogant management of this restaurant. I came here at 3:15 and despite the buffet being open, the managers were in a hurry to close shop and made me leave. The official timing was 3:30 pm. Suggest the owner to have someone who cares about business and customer service particularly near to closing hours!!!  Utterly pathetic customer service!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the buffet. It was mostly lukewarm and vegetarian... Unfortunately. The tandoori chicken was fresh and hot though."}
{"text":"The food was really good, fresh, and had a good taste. The south Indian cusine especially idli was very fresh and soft, and the chatnis sambar were amazing. Info Chinese food was also great.   Just make sure you tell them how spicy you like your food and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing, restaurant is huge, but doesn't need to be. I had the buffet the food wasn't great but wasn't bad. For 15 bucks with unlimited dosa's. I guess I can't really complain. The dosas are decent. I suggest rava dosa. Again don't go to this spot if you are expecting something amazing."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Yelp! and I since I live nearby and now love Indian food, I thought I'd stop in.  According to what I read, the buffet is open at 5pm on Sundays, but when I arrived after 5pm on a Sunday, the buffet was not open.  In fact, the restaurant was open, but the lights were off and the owners were chatting at a table by the door.  I walked to inquire about the hours for the buffet.  They said, \"6 o'clock\", to which, I replied, \"I'll be back.\"  So I returned at 6:16 PM and there was now a sign blinking that said, \"Open\".  Plus, the lights were on and there was one group of people dining.  This place is very large and can seat lots of people.  It's as if their dream was to one day accommodate lots and lots of guests to fine Indian cuisine.  Well, that day may never come, I'm sad to report.  There was no one at the front desk to greet me so I had to walk back into the restaurant before a young, shy Indian woman approached me.  It was as if she was thinking, \"What the hell is THAT guy doing here?\"  I asked if the buffet was open and she said yes.  I asked many other questions too because she was not offering any info.  Anyway, to make a long story somewhat shorter, I finally received several containers to put some buffet goodies in to take to my family, as planned.  If you want to know the names of the dishes, you're going to have to visit yourself because I sure do not know!  I first selected some chicken with onions and peppers in a curry sauce because it was obviously the only main course.  Then I grabbed some yellow rice with more peppers and onions and spices.  Then I grabbed some bread with spices on it.  I spooned some chutney into the little sauce cups they gave me and looked for some curried veggies.  Found those, and loaded up the remaining area in my dinner container.  I was hoping to check out quickly and be on my way, but I had to wait 10 minutes for four dosas to be ready.    While I was waiting, I noticed a bar in the back with a huge selection of top shelf alcohol.  It was right next to the small buffet, which was odd.  After about 15 minutes in total and paying my $14 bill, I finally was on my way home.    I invited my wife and kids to eat the food, but it ended up being too spicy for their pallets.  Compared to the other Indian restaurants I've been to, this food was at least two notches higher on the Scoville scale.  Everything was spicy except the carrot and sugar dessert.  It was good though.  The chicken with peppers and onions had some kick, but the taste was very good.  The yellow rice also packed a punch, but had a decent flavor.  The bread had a mild spice, was tough, but decent.  I'm used to bread that is hot, steaming, and falling apart, however.  The curried veggies were my favorite.  They had a little spice and lot of flavor.  Loved those!  Finally, the dosas were very spicy, but very tasty.  They had potatoes, garlic, and some other ground up veggies in them.  Overall, the meal was pretty tasty, but it had a lot of kick...more kick than my family likes.  So we won't be going here again.    I am hoping that one day, my family will learn to like Indian food.  It would be nice to visit a local Indian restaurant that serves mild food with the spicy chutneys on the side (like Taj India Palace), so you can dictate the Scoville level of your meal."}
{"text":"I ate here while in town for work and was glad to find Priya. I had a Delicious and well-seasoned dinner. They also had a delicious-looking and well-stocked chaat bar and a broader selection of South Indian cuisine than I can usually get. I ultimately decided against dosa and went with the guthi vankaya and mix grill and they were both excellent.  The food was made for us, so the service is a little slower than I am accustomed to--just keep it in mind and call in your order if your time frame is limited. Once you get the food, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Chat buffet went downhill, food was not hot and all the items they were out & I guess chef changed too as the food is below average. I'm super disappointed in freshness & also quality of the food. I might need to find a new Indian place. :("}
{"text":"Actually this place recently changed management and is now called Flavor6, but yes it still reads \"Priya\" on the store front. Went on a Sunday late afternoon for Indian buffet. This place is huge, great for a gathering with a big bunch of friends looking for a spicy, flavorful meal.  Immediately upon entrance, is a classy fountain/pond one might see in Italy. Entire place isn't fancy, it's casual, friendly staff that came to us and talked a little about their food, how they prepare it. Seemed like a genuine interest in our enjoying our experience.  Along the buffet line:  -Fresh cut vegetables (red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers), which I thought paired well with some of their dishes or just dip in some of their dipping sauces. -Few types of seasoned rice, some with chicken (I believe it was called chicken bouiliani?) -some of the tiniest fried chicken wings I've ever seen, but crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Similar to myself. Dipped these into some yogurt based sauces, one was coconut and another was tomato....YUM -At least 12 different Indian dishes with varying degrees of hot factor.   Great options for vegetarians. Overall food was not greasy. I left happy and with my belt buckle undone."}
