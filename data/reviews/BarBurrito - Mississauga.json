{"text":"pros: none really   cons: it's not as good as burrito boyz on stavebank  stale nachos ...boring   the bowl was ok    was expecting more because i wanted another good alternative tex mex"}
{"text":"I got the chicken tacos and it was so good, but as a previous reviewer said, the nachos are pretty salty.  In addition, the staff working tonight were so nice. Even though I arrived 15 minutes before closing (and the place looked like it was already cleaned), they still served me with a smile and a positive attitude."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.   English is not their first language.  The lady would put the meat on each customers order before finishing anyone's order off.   The cashier tried to double charge me for my tacos.   Will not be back.  Then they give you the bag and the tacos no longer look like proper tacos!    Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I should be giving  4 stars...........but I think the ingredients are very good.   The issue I had tonight was my taco shells were not crunchy. I would not recommend the crunchy corn shells since they were not crunchy ( should have gotten soft)  but the shells are not very big and for 9 dollars ( or 10 after tax) you get three small tacos. The ingredients were good that is why I give it five stars...I had two chicken and one ground beef taco.    the only issue also on a previous visit is that I ordered the large burrito and they gave me lots of rice and bean but when it came time to put tomato  they put very little tomato and out of onions that one day.  so yeah,  you should probably tell them less rice if you don't want too much rice in your burrito.  They offer you beans also.......its just they should have put less rice in my large burrito and more veggies like tomato. I absolutely love Mexican food and would probably buy a large burrito everyday if they just put a little more veggies. I like rice and beans but just not everyday.  Chicken is usually good portion tho.  I want them to survive because there is not enough good Mexican places around here.  thinking of trying the other bar burritos around......"}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight through SkipTheDishes. I orders the two beef taco combo with a Drink and nachos. Let me start with the my strongest thought...  THESE ARE THE SALTIEST NACHOS EVER. Actually. I was wiping the salt off with s napkin off each chip. My mouth is still burning. They also had a strong aftertaste of burnt oil. Meanwhile the tacos were boring. I like that you have many options for the toppings. I had beef tacos. The beef was unseasoned, unflavorful, blan, and oily. Overall, the best part of this meal was the Diet Coke. I would not order from here again and would not recommend."}
