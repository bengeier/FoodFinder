{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Thai Basil Noodle with Chicken  I was surprised the Thai Basil Noodle tasted exactly the same as Salad King, then I found out the chef from Salad King started this restaurant!  The meat here tasted better than Salad King. It's a pity it so far away from Yonge Street.

{"text":"For cheap thai food, this was pretty lousy. Also, not noticeably that affordable. Had nice service when I was there, but the shrimp and chicken in my dish were really bad. The shrimp was frozen still and the chicken was very fatty.   Service was nice and if it had been $2 less, I probably wouldn't have complained."}
{"text":"Wow - people really eat here? We stopped in because the Yelp reviews were so good and left with perhaps the worst thai food I have ever encountered (I would say eaten, but some of it was so bad it just had to be thrown out).  I ordered vegetarian green curry, vegetarian pad thai and vegetarian spring rolls. The pad thai was tasteless clumps of rice noodles congealed without sauce decorated with some cold lumps of pre-fried tofu. The green curry came in a styrofoam container that had been melted through from the outside - leaving the curry spilling all over the inside of the bag and the remainder in the container tasting of well - styrofoam. The vegetables in the curry included yellow broccolli (as in so old it was flowering)  - the coconut in the sauce was so rancid even once I got past the styrafoam flavour that it had to be thrown out.   It's not particularly cheep and you don't even get what you paid for."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. Food is delicious but the owners are amazing.  Friendly, sweet couple that runs it.  The food is delicous, the portions are very big, but at the end of the day, the combo of great service and food, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Here's the story of Flip, Toss, Thai: the former chef at The Salad King, left and started Flip, Toss, Thai. Now you know there was some serious beef there, you can just tell by the menu and the fact that they claim all that in black and white.  They do delivery, but it's not an exact science. It's more of a takeout joint than I restaurant. I mean, you can eat here but it's like eating at a cafeteria kitchen, why would you when you can just have it in your own house?  The prices are good, the quality is great and the flavor is on high."}
{"text":"Not bad, pretty typical take out thai, not as good as I had expected considering I had heard that the cooks and owners were former employees of Salad King and they were replicating the same menu items.  The food was not of the same quality taste-wise and the portions were small.  The most frustrating part was the the delivery man came with only a pocket full of change, so when I paid my bill he ended up with a nearly $10 tip because all he could give me was a handful of quarters and a few loonies from his pocket.  Needless to say, I was not happy.  For this reason alone I would not recommend this place...there is better, or at least comparable places in the city that I would go to before here again."}
{"text":"This place is my go to delivery place. It's un-authentic, but its decently tasty and cheap. The Panang Fish is what me and my partner always get. Fried fish dumped into a creamy peanutty sauce with veggies and rice (no extra charge!) Awesome. Two fish curries and spring rolls for under 25 dollars delivered, my boyfriend and me are suitable full.   I don't think it pretends to be anything more than a cheap Thai place, and its definitely NOT a place to come and chill for dinner with friends. It's more of a pick up and delivery joint. There is a reason why hot dog stands exist. No ones gonna grip about the 3 dollars they spent on grilled sausages while eating on the street. In the end it will fill your stomach and leave a good taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"The first time I had Flip Toss & Thai I was not too terribly impressed.  I'm not sure if the kitchen was having an off day or what.  But overall I just remember being unimpressed.  Luckily a friend of mine convinced me to go back with her a year or so later, and I was really glad that I did.  The food was delicious, and made so fast there was no time to wonder if I'd ordered the wrong thing.  My favorite dishes are the spicy eggplant and the golden tofu.  This is a great place to bring non-meat eaters, as there is a wealth of veggie options available, all of which are really tasty.  The staff is also super friendly and will make suggestions if you aren't sure what you want to order.  If you eat in, the dining room is very small, so you probably don't want to linger very much.  On summer days, the best thing is to sit on the benches outside and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary about the food here, really. It is average to most other Asian food places. What really irks me is the service that me and my friends got. 4 of us went, 3 of us were planning on sitting in and eating there. The owner seemed friendly enough when we were placing our orders and paying him. One of our friends brought her own small salad in a Tupperware container. Two of us had already ordered, and were sitting down with our friend when the owner, a middle-aged man, told my friend that she could not eat her own food there -- his approximate words being \"it is our policy!\" My friend promptly (and politely) apologized, and attempted to say that she was going to order something small to from them to have with her salad. But he cut her off, in a rather rude, and condescending tone, saying \"NO! Sorry! Policy!\" My how manners change. So, the two of us who had ordered changed ours to take-out and the waitress who gave us our food had an embarrassed and apologetic look on her face. It is one thing to politely ask your patrons not to eat any other food (and somewhat understandable). But when 3 of the 4 people in one group are ordering from you and you are acting extremely rude and condescending towards them, you're not going to keep the customers. While we were waiting for our orders to be made, the man came over to tell us that our backpacks were placed on his chairs, making it seem like the restaurant was occupied. \"Move your bags! It is not a free ride, you know!\" were his approximate* words. The 3rd order which had not been made yet was canceled. One of the women I was with was a (past tense) regular there, and knew the owner on a friendly enough basis. As we were exiting, she attempted to politely express her disappointment and frank surprise at rudeness of the man in question. But instead of hearing his longtime customer's viewpoint, he simply cut her off tell her to leave his restaurant. If you want average Thai cuisine with little respect to human dignity from this man, by all means go here. But you can get the same quality of food (if not BETTER!) from any other restaurant.  *Approximate as memory serves. I cannot say the exact phrasing as I do not remember the exact sequence of words. But those were the words used."}
{"text":"Can you get great Take-Out ....that is fast and super friendly every time? Here you can :) My Buddy introduced me to this neighborhood Thai Take-Out Kitchen and I have been back MANY times since. For under $10 you get a Super Tasty Thai dinner on rice. I had the Basil Chicken Yesterday and loved it: (Carrots, bell peppers, onions, garlic, and basil in a mild Thai sauce) . ..but next time I am going to have what my friend had, the Golden Curry. I recommend the Spring Rolls too...they are really good too :) They have been written up in newspapers before for their service and food. Come by and say hi to WEI th owner...Another GEM! :)"}
{"text":"This is certainly not the best meal that I've ever eaten, but also not the worst. It's also not very 'Thai' in an authentic sense, as everything we ordered consisted of gallons and gallons of oyster sauce.   The bottom line is that they deliver for $1 if you order more than $20  worth of food. When you're in a bind and your fridge is empty, this is a decent option but certainly not my first choice for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"This location is great for students, and the guy at the front always has the brightest smile and the most enthusiastic attitude!  I strongly advise NOT to get any noodle dish, but their curry bowls are PHENOMENAL! I'm constantly craving them.  Their prices are decent, huge selection under $10, but as a poor student I can't go as often as I'd like.  They're very accommodating if you don't want a certain ingredient and you get to check the level of spicy that you want, which is pretty cool.  I recommend it (minus the noodles) and will definitely be back many more times."}
{"text":"I had the worst pad thai I could ever have here! I ordered a pad thai for pick up and when I got home I could not even believe it is pad thai! plain white rice noodle with a few tofu and broccoli on top. No sauce in it at all, no taste!"}
{"text":"Cheap Thai food.  Get a big pile for just under $9.  Small place despite the long outdoor store front.   You can get the spicy from 0-5 or 1-6 (conflicting scales advertised). I got a 4. Had to drink about 2 litres of water. It made me very uncomfortable, and I think the workers from the orient were laughing at my arrogance and following punishment. I tried the pad thai with a spicy level of 2- which was delicious.   Guess the owners came from Salad King. This is way better than that (not saying THAT much, though).  PS They don't have any milk."}
{"text":"I LOVE Flip, Toss, & Thai because they're family run, unpretentious, and make the most awesome comfort food.  I prefer their \"vegetarian\" dishes (namely curries) to meat dishes: the emerald curry, golden tofu curry. The lost star is for the slight lack in veggies in meat dishes (you end up mostly with onions/carrots type thing). I enjoy their spicy fish and PENANG FISH! Awesome.  Their mango salad, cold rolls, and taro spring rolls are all tasty as well. Simple, but good. And sometimes simple (with a spicy kick) is all you need."}
{"text":"I didn't like it all.  the veg green curry was bitter and had no flavour.  the pad thai was not properly prepared; it was weird - it was watery and pasty at the same time.   and the spring rolls were spoiled;  that's when i draw the line.  that means the cook used old produce that was already going bad."}
{"text":"regular Thai food at a regular price. Absolutely nothing special whatsoever, which nine times out of ten is exactly what I'm looking for in a thai joint. Pad Thai is light and flavourful and service is quick. I found the spring rolls underwhelming, but then I'd just eaten at Golden Turtle and it's hard to compare.  If you're in the neighbourhood and too lazy to look further it's a fine choice for a mid-week meal."}
{"text":"Good cheap food in big portions  Quick Friendly Service  What more can you ask for? Brilliant place!"}
{"text":"I always love to visit places that are vegetarian-friendly, somewhere I can go with any of my friends to eat. So I dropped in to Flip and Toss this past Friday to see what I could try.  A quick scan of the vegetarian menu on the chalkboard revealed a couple of options I was interested in - when I stepped up to order I asked if I could have the Golden Tofu Curry, but without the fish sauce it had noted up there. The response I got was along the lines of \"no, the fish sauce is in there and it's pre-made, all the curries must have fish sauce in there for the taste.\" A little confused I asked why the curries were on the vegetarian menu, but was pretty much dismissed when he decided to take a phone order in the middle of serving me.  I waited for this to be done, and decided to just order one of the non-curries on the vegetarian menu, as there was a lineup building behind me and I don't like to be problematic. The cashier barely spoke to me except to confirm my order, but as I sat down and watched him serve the rest of the line I saw him be far more polite and offer up things like glasses of water to folks. When I did get my food I had to ask for water, and was given a small glass that would've been barely a cup of water.  When my meal was done, the restaurant was quiet with no lineup and I felt I could bring up my issues with the poor service with the cashier - I didn't want to just leave there and drop negative feedback on Yelp without first trying to resolve it at the source. When trying to tell him I felt I got poor attitude and dismissive service, and that his vegetarian menu was misleading if it had fish sauce in half of what's on there, he kept barking irrelevant questions back at me and even just walked away from me at one point. I don't ever go into a restaurant with the aim of making trouble and I truly wanted to give this little restaurant a chance - instead I was given the worst customer service i've received anywhere in Toronto, and left feeling utterly demoralised.  Flip and Toss, your one star is for the food (Spicy Tofu, $7.96) - while it was a little more expensive than it should be for the quality and quantity, at least it was edible and didn't have an attitude."}
{"text":"I usually get delivery now that I no longer live close by. Friendly on the phone service and they deliver faster than any pizza place! $20 minimum before taxes to qualify for a delivery order. a couple of times, my orders have been a bit on the bland side but I still enjoy their food. my favourites are the golden tofu curry, sunshine dumplings and even though it's not on the menu, there's a vegetarian soup that's hearty and delicious! they deserve to be on speed dial!"}
{"text":"Flip Toss & Thai is incredibly tasty!   I've only ordered take-out from here but the food is delicious and SO cheap. Some of the best value and taste for your money.  Every person I've ever encountered there has been friendly and nice and their delivery never seems to take as long as they say it will (typically about 20 minutes to the annex - which is AWESOME).  You should definitely check it out if you want cheap AND delicious take out."}
{"text":"Flip, Toss, and Thai is like a focal point for my life. I arrange errands around its Harbord St. location so I can home in on it like a hungry polar bear. Favorite dishes include Golden Tofu Curry, Emerald Curry, Spicy Fish, Rainbow Chicken, Evil Prince, and more. Some other reviewers mention that it's \"cheap\" -- not so much, I find. The point is the consistent quality and the creativity of the dishes, and the fact that the owners' charm will warm your heart through and through. There are no better people in the city of Toronto. Portions can be on the small side. The primary purpose of this place is takeout.   I don't understand some of the reviews here. Nicole H, well over half the menu is vegetarian. Cheer up, it's going to be OK."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. The food is authentic, tasty and made fresh for every order. My favourites are the Cold Roll (starter) and Golden Tofu Curry (main). I leave every time feeling healthy and very satisfied.  Dishes are ready very quickly - average wait time is 5-8 minutes. This is a family-run restaurant with lovely owners. Helpings are generous with large amounts of high-quality ingredients. Prices are extremely affordable. Vegetarian friendly.  You can eat in, call in advance and pick up your order, or have your order delivered."}
{"text":"Okay so it's not authentic authentic thai. But if you're stuck at U of T studying away, this is a great salad king alternative on this side of town. Almost exactly the same dishes, friendly counter service and I swear, takes less than 10 minutes to prepare if you're eating in......I like the glass noodles."}
{"text":"This place looks very sketchy from outside, but after reading some Yelp reviews, we decided to give it a go.   We ordered and paid at the cash register and filled our own glasses of water. Items are all under $10. Our generous portioned meal was served quickly after ordering by the friendly cashier/order taker.    We shared the taro spring rolls and theywere alright. I ordered the basil fried chicken and requested it to be very spicy, but it wasn't at all. I'm told that the spicy fish was quite good. All the food was served fresh, but definitely wasn't authentic Thai."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place quite a bit since I live close by--it was pretty good, not the best in town, but good for a quick bite--however, after a few scary experiences (scary for a vegetarian, that is), I now avoid this place like the plague. Basically, the green vegetable curry, which was my go-to meal, arrived with a meat bone floating around in it. I returned it and was promised this was some freak accident where a bone accidentally fell into what they promise is a pristine meat free vegetable curry pot. A few weeks later, it happened again... this time it was a piece of meat. They again swore this was an accident. Third time's a charm, but I chose to stay away rather than get another meaty surprise in my \"vegetarian\" curry.  If you don't mind surprise meat in non-meat dishes, the meals were alright, perhaps a little too pricey for what you get. The owners are incredibly friendly, though."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite cheap-eats place in Toronto.  My grad school buddies and I would come here every week or two for lunch.  The pad thai is awesome - get it just a bit spicy and it adds some extra punch - and is made really quickly.  The food is affordable and fresh, and it's nice that it's an independent shop too (much better than patronizing pizza pizza).  There isn't much in the way of seating - some plastic chairs that were meant to be used on a patio and some stools and a counter, but it was always sufficient and better than eating in the basement of Sid Smith."}
{"text":"If there's a negative rate is definitely the worse restaurant I had in my life. One of my order for my delivery was mango sticky rice. After I open the box, the mango is hard  and white. I got angry and call the restaurant. The old guy pick up the phone and explain it is not their fault, the mango is from \"south America\" and bunch of nonsense, such the mango is raw. I told him this is not right, and should tell me the problem beforehand. Cause I don't believe anyone would eat a nasty raw fruit, I told him your store doesn't promise quality of your food, just like your food is undone. And I can't believe he say, you can see the picture in our menu, which there isn't in the website AND have to take the risk of delivery. NOW IT'S MY FAULT THAT I HAVE TO EAT RAW FRUIT?! Not reasonable man as he is like and i am frustrated with it. But it's ok, it is his pity to lose a costumer. these kind of \"boss\" usually don't have his restaurant last long, it's so pity. and honest opinion, the food is two-star rate and the price isn't cheap either. You can find way better food on yonge or bloor st.  All I wrote, I posed it with pictures. Horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is run by a former chef of Salad King (just off Yonge near Dudas) and from what I can see in the menu, it's pretty much Salad King but CHEAPER!   From what seems to be a family run business, all the servers are really nice, and friendly. It's a small place and not really a restaurant although there are a few places to sit, the food is really good and you really can't go wrong with this place!   I personally really liked their pad thai and if you're looking for quick take out thai food, you can't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in town. Have been coming on and off for 14 years, as a student initially, and moreso lately now that I live nearby again. Always so friendly and affordable and tasty and home made! Fave dish is the golden curry but lately completed addicted to the green curry and ever increasing spicyness levels. The best kept secret in town:)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city, try the golden curry chicken"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go in the city. It's cheap, the food is amazing, and the owners are the nicest people in the world. It's as if your parents opened a Thai restaurant and for some reason still charge you.   Great for vegetarians/vegans, they have a lot of different options. I tend to always get the Country Fried Tofu since it's so amazing, its tofu and veggies on rice with a sorta sweet garlic sauce. I highly recommend trying it.  1 word of warning, they will ask you \"how spicy do you want it?\" You have the option of 0-5. You might want to start off small. I've had friends who like a lot of spice ask for 4-5, and had their faces melted right off their body. Be careful."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go here but that never materialized.  Until today that is. It was a rainy day and I was craving pad Thai. Then I remembered this place.   I was greeted by a friendly woman at the counter. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai (medium spicy) to go.   This was by far the worst pad Thai I've had in a long time. They skimped on the green onion and coriander. I couldn't taste any tamarind (which is my favorite part).  Overall it was just bland. That small piece of lime wedge couldn't save the mound of noodles.   Worst part of all, there was a huge piece of plastic tape or some kind of packaging in my pad Thai. I threw all of it in the garbage where it belongs as soon as i seen it. This shows me that no care is taken when preparing the food here.   These kinds of places make me weary of trying new places. I should have read some reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"Solid place for cheap Thai food and they deliver too! I ordered from them with a bunch of co-workers when we were working late. They were fast and reliable. I had the panang curry tofu, \"mild\" (still quite spicy given that I'm pretty wimpy with spice, but not too too spicy). The pieces of tofu were huge and delicious. I only wished there was more broccoli and red peppers. Other people ordered the pad thai, mango salad, green curry chicken, friend rice, and basil beef -- they all seemed pretty happy with their dishes too."}
{"text":"I grabbed a bite while I was doing a couple of loads of laundry at the laundromat across the street. I had the green curry and it was good."}
{"text":"Because Yelpers rating on this restaurant is either love or hate (There's no middle), I decided to try it out with my own tongue. I ordered pad thai. it was supposed to be $8.59 + tax (=$9.70), but I was charged $10.18... I realized they overcharged me when I got home. It's a small mistake, however it is unpleasant enough for a customer who goes there first time and try out the experience with them. It's a family owned restaurant. The casher seemed to be the one of the owner(wife). No excuse for this kinda mistake. Moreover, she wasn't that friendly like other people say. I really care about the friendliness environment in any kind of customer services, because I also work in a retail store and I try hard to please my clients every day. If she was super friendly, I would dismiss this because hey everyone makes a mistake, but no smile, no greeting plus overcharging gives 2 stars. It could be 1 star, but I don't wanna judge too quickly. I might give it a try one more time someday. Pad thai itself was OK. Not ketchupy pad thai which is good, but it was very very insipid."}
{"text":"Terrific little place, unfailingly helpful and friendly service.  Not the fanciest joint, but a reliable place in the neighbourhood, delivers rain, sun, or snow.  It's strictly a mon'n'pop operation,  so keep your expectations measured, but you just might fall in love with the place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and really love this place. Not fancy, just really fresh, great Thai food. Always the same friendly woman taking your order and always the same great female cook in the open kitchen. I order the spicy eggplant with brown rice every time."}
{"text":"Flip and toss..I am a fan!  The chicken pad Thai was so flavorful. There were many things in it like tofu, vegetables and of course, well seasoned big chunks of chicken. I big pet peeve about Pad Thai is that there usually to much sauce, but these guys nailed it!  The service was friendly and fast. All for a good price too! Strongly recommend you go here!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The owners seem very nice. And I want it to be good. Having been here twice though, I've been disappointed both times.  First time was the street noodle soup ($5.99 before tax) which sounded exciting but was just blah, with a serious paucity of ingredients. Then it was the summer rolls. The rolls each contained ONE tiny shrimp, split in half! The mango they put in added some much needed flavour, but even that was overwhelmed by a mound of noodles, and there was no sign of the promised egg OR basil. The accompanying dipping sauce was watered down so much I could barely taste it. Two missing ingredients (three if you count the shrimp), zero flavour (I ended up throwing half of it out--and I NEVER throw out food), and it cost me almost seven bucks.  When I think that my local Vietnamese place does a version of this dish with three massive (twice the size) rolls stuffed with shrimp and a proper dipping sauce for four bucks, I just can't justify coming back here again."}
{"text":"What I expected: cheap thai food. What I got: cheap thai food with a smile. I've now been here three times and tried the Cashew Chicken, the Panang Chicken, and the Pad Thai. All are good and veggies are fresh, but there could be more of them.  Service is really quick and friendly and there is a small amount of seating if you're dining in."}
{"text":"No frills, affordable Thai food served by very friendly owners. Service was fast.  Tried the basil noodles with beef added on and devoured the very large portion easily.  The rainbow curry was pleasant enough (and came with huge steamed rice portion) but I enjoyed the noodles more.   Great flavours overall. You can set your spice level too."}
{"text":"I just stop by this place because I want a Thai food.8.95 $ for a padthai which was the worse padthai I ever have in my life. The noodle is too soft and soak with water. Sauce was very sour with no other taste. I only ate a shrimp in the plate and leave all the noodle part.  Seafood fries rice with crab sauce was not bad . If you like salad king fried rice , then this place is pretty similar . Good smell of garlic and a lots of seafood . Give 3 stars for this place. I also order \" tom yum\" with coconut milk. The taste was not bad but it not pretty close to an original tom yum. They put a lettuce in the Tomyum soup. I am from thailand and I never see any Tomyum like this before. Overall , I think this place is too pricy for a take home delivery food . There are a couple table for you to eat there. It looks like more cafeteria than a restaurant. Go to salad king will be better taste and better place."}
{"text":"Solid 3. Good value for money.  I wasn't blown away by the quality of green curry and rice that I ordered, but for $8.80 or so tax in at dinner its pretty good.  I'd probably go spicy next time as opposed to just medium, maybe it would be more to my taste, and try the soup as well.  For a take-out lunch, I'd rather go get the $6.99 special at Sit-In Bangkok at College and Crawford.  As for the owner, holy cow, who beat the happy into him?  I grabbed a seat last night as I ate my food happily watching this guy greet the customers."}
{"text":"It's already been said that the owner is a former chef of the infamous Salad King...and yes, it definitely shows. But I actually prefer Flip, Toss, Thai better! The staff are friendly and the service is super quick. I would suggest taking out, but there is the option to dine in (the basics, tables and chairs) or get delivery (minimum 20 dollars).   The prices are beyond reasonable, and you can get a really filling meal for under 10 dollars. My favourites are the mango salad, penang curry, and any of the soups.   The chilli scale allows you to choose the level of spiciness you want, and there's tons of selection, definitely something for everyone. In my opinion, some of the best cheap thai food in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a little family run restaurant, reliable authentic thai food, nothing fancy. It is very casual sit in or take out. The staff are friendly and very helpful  My relatives live around here so we like to come here for a casual dinner once in a while.  We like their curries, pad Thai, basil noodles, and fried rice. I love the vegetarian spring rolls (I think they use taro root for the filling).  Overall it is a good and casual thai restaurant if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good. I took two friends there last night and we were all in unison that FT&T is simply delicious.  We got two orders of pad thai, some squid dish, a bowl of soup and mango sticky rice. The pad thai was delicious and generous with the tofu, no comment on the squid, and the soup was amazing. I'd go just for the soup. Maybe I wouldn't order it with three chilis again, but maybe I would.  As for the mango sticky rice, I asked the woman working there if we could have some extra mango since we were three people and that charging us a bit extra was no problem. She said it's fine and gave us a beautiful dessert with heaps of mango, no extra charge at all. Wow! Thank you!  My super smiley man wasn't there until the end of our meal but the woman at the register is equally as smiley and adorable.  I LOVE THIS PLACE."}
