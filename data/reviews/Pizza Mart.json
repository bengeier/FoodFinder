{"text":"I like this place because of a few reasons.... 1 the pizza is cheap and still maintains a pretty good quality. 2 the arcade games make me feel young again with old school ninja turtles and mortal combat. 3 great place to have a family meal because there is a kids room with tons of seating. I'm just surprised I've never been here before until recently.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This pizza is to die for!! Not only is customer service great but the arcade games!? Amazing! You have to get an ice cream cone as well. Delicious soft served ice cream. Not the best area in Mesa but those areas always have the best family owned restaurants! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE GOOD-TASTING PIZZA (and you have standards), STAY AWAY. I literally rank Lil' Caesers above this place. Any chain restaurant, for that matter, has better pizza. Their crust and sauce and cheese distribution is gross. The arcade games inside is a very nice touch, but half of them ate my money and there were a million slimey unattended, unsupervised children running everywhere and being completely rude and ruining the experience for me and my kids. There is a salad bar but it looks like it has a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some tomatoes and cukes, about the lamest salad bar I have ever seen. Save your money and get a $5 Hot n' Ready!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Now don't get me started with how delicious the pizza is, it's affordable and fulfilling you can sit and enjoy a nice evening with the kids or Friends as they have old school video games and customer service has always been great the times we've checked in!"}
{"text":"Good price for a pepperoni pizza and the buffalo wings are great. Nice neighborhood place with good prices on pretty much everything on the menu"}
{"text":"DISSAPOINTED  I first read the reviews and some are good and some are ok. I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a large pepperoni for $4.95. My wife and I thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce. I would have given it another try, but I was taken back by the fact that when I giot home my bill was $5.73. I called and spoke to the owner this morning and get this there is a 30 cent carry out charge that no one mentioned.  WHAT!!!. The owner said it was for the box. What a cheap way to get money out pf people.He said it was on the menu. I called it in. If the guy that rang me up had mentioned this I would have been more open about this. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!! I saw in the reviews that people were apprehensive due to its age, but every time I am in there, its so clean and well kept, you could eat off the floors....Fantastic prices, and some of the best Pizza around. Great Family environment, and the staff is ALWAYS friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Up until my last trip I have enjoyed their pizza and old fashion games. I was in Saturday night getting a pizza when the cashiers child was behind the counter on the floor begging and pleading to make his own pizza. The cashier gave in and then the child got up off the floor whipped his nose with his hands, and went to the line to make himself a pizza. I could not believe my eyes. This little boy is touching all the ingredients with his filthy bare hands! This breaks all food handling code violations that I am aware of. I will never return to this place if this is how they handle their food...never again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is great inexpensive pizza in a very family friendly environment. It may be a bit of nostalgia, but I've been stopping by since I was in high school in the 80's. They still have the old video games and token system. This isn't a fancy pizza, this is the kind of pizza you eat with your kids (even when they get old).   Very simple and good pizza in a unique environment that has remained almost the same for 30 years.  Also my kids where stoked it had homemade ranch!"}
{"text":"Was so yummy! Been going to pizza mart since I was a kid always consistant and always great service and pizza for a great price!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at pizza mart for over 30 years. I now take my own family here. They have inexpensive pizza salad bar wings and beer. My kids absolutely love the video games and ice cream cones.  It's nice to go to a pizza parlor and spend $30 or less on your whole family it sure beats the guys down the street and $50 or more"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pizza Mart since I was a little kid and I can honestly say the service and food has never let me down ! The pizza might take a while but it is definitely worth the wait. I usually prefer take out because the place is a little too crowded on the weekends but that just goes to show how great this place is . Definitely worthy of the 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 5.50 large pizza special, it was so yummy! Definitely something to try. Way better than little Caesars ;)"}
{"text":"The best soft serve icecream and only 35 cents.  The pizza is really good too and much more inexpensive than any other pizza place.  Only $6 for a large.  I first came here about 10 years ago.  Always a good experience."}
{"text":"Great little retro pizza place reminds me of the pizza places that were popular when I was a kid. Has the same video games, even! The pizza is made fresh and extremely cheap. I can feed the entire family for under $20. The ice cream and sides are great too."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's old school, nothing to write home about atmosphere-wise BUT, the pizza is excellent and it is cheap. One of my favorite places in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this pizza joint for 35+ years. The pizza is great and CHEAP. $5.50 for a large pepperoni pizza. They have old school arcade games that don't cost an arm and a leg either.  I LOVE this place. Totally kid friendly."}
{"text":"Ok my husband looked up the website and tried calling in for an order of pizza! none the less the website says its open till 10 pm and its only 8:45 pm and they said that they are closed! why is it that we called about fifteen minutes before 9 and was ready to pick up and they couldn't take our order.  it was the owner that we spoke too and said that the ovens were shut down for the night. This does not sound like a place that is willing to provide to the community. An He Was RUDE about IT!"}
{"text":"Great music playing on the radio. Took my soon to be 2nd grader for an afternoon of pizza, ice cream, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Ms. Pac Man, Galaga etc.  The food is not stellar, but it's reasonably priced.  They do have beer here as well.  I'm sure we'll be back with the kids in tow.  Mostly a younger crowd at lunch time.  The place is definitely divey, but it was pretty spotless.  People working are nice as well.  Don't miss out on the 50 cent ice cream cones either."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. Pizza and wings were delicious. The staff is very friendly. Very well kept and clean. The prices are just right.  The only thing about this place I didn't like is if you want a salad they give you a small a$$ plate and you can only get a one time trip around the salad table. I personally think its not worth it."}
{"text":"This place has been terrible forever. I wonder how it stays open the building itself is enough reason to stay away & the pizza is worse. Plus there is the best pizza place in arizona hands down within walking distance from this place. I've had to eat here with family many times and we've found human hair in our pizza almost every time. I really have no idea why my grandfather likes this place so much."}
{"text":"We go to pizza mart every week keeps the kids and our wallets happy :)"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good for the price and the restaurant has a rustic atmosphere that reminds me of the 80s especially with the pac man and mortal kombat games."}
{"text":"Do not go here for food.  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the pizza here.  It might actually be worse than Little Caesar's or Peter Piper.  The ambiance doesn't redeem the place, either... Unless your favorite aura when you dine out is \"divey.\"  I'd suggest you just skip the bad pizza and bad ambiance altogether and just hang out in the parking lot... But this is near one of Mesa's several nexi of ghetto.  Don't even hang out in the parking lot.  Why two stars?  Because the people who run the place are nice.  In a world of rampant narcissism and superficiality, being nice should count for something.  I'd suggest that your best bet is to walk in, chat with the proprietors for a few minutes, hand them $5 or so for a bottled Mexican soda just to show appreciation, and leave.  Don't eat the pizza, or hang out.  My suggestion to the owners as to how to improve the pizza: all it needs is better crust, better sauce, and maybe better cheese.  Really, that's not too much to change, right?"}
{"text":"This place is super fun! Why haven't I been here before? This is the cheapest way to take my kids out for some food and fun. The girl who rang us up was super sweet, we love the old school decor, and it totally reminds me of being a kid in the 80's and going out for pizza with my parents. The food was pretty good and the games were fun."}
{"text":"Got a pan pizza home and it was no where near cooked.  Took it back and was told at around 6pm that there was no more pan pizzas so they couldn't (or wouldn't) give me a new one.  I opted to get the money back and ate buger king which was great! We have gone to this place for years but the quality and customer service is why I will not be ever going back.  This place sucks in all categories.  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Gotta love Pizza Mart! This place looks really ghetto outside, but it's an oldschool gem on the inside. The pizza is yummy and for 5.00 you really can't beat it. Lots of old arcade games. They also have a salad bar, but it's nothing special. All in all a  great place to get a cheap pizza, beer, and ice cream."}
{"text":"Pizza Mart was my very first favorite spot, besides McDonald's, when i was a teeney lil' hyper brat.  This place has the best pizza dough and great customer service. Not expensive AT ALL!!! and the best part is when your done stuffing your belly with delicious hot oven pizza, you can get a soft serve vanilla  icecream cone for super cheap! makes for a fun first date... they have lots of old video games like king-kong, pac-man, zelda, etc.  atmosphere is very casual... very eighties."}
{"text":"well priced good food and games for kids helpful staff very clean for the area it's in .. its a old buliding but don't mind cause it ans good pizza"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Large Pepperoni Pizza for just $5.50. Its a fun atmosphere with old school video games including TMNT!! The service is friendly with a smile. The have good sports, great music and cheap beer! Kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"I am sad to say this is the worst pizza I've ever tasted. The crust is like dry chalk. The cheese or I'm not sure what it is has a slightly rotten sour taste. I'm shocked that this place has such good reviews. Right now there's a birthday party going on and the place is pretty busy. God knows why. The lady at the counter is nice and I got a root beer float which was tasty. The salad bar isn't bad. Only iceberg lettuce. Not many choices to add to the lettuce. The ranch dressing is good. They do have the old timey video games which is cool. Honestly though the pizza was so bad I had to spit out a bite and say enough already. I would tell them but I think they either wouldn't care or not believe me. Well these people in here must have no tastebuds."}
{"text":"Great value, but actually great pizza. Cheese is quality, sauce is fresh and I'd say overall this is my favorite pizza away from the gourmet restaurants.   This has been my favorite location spot for 25 years! Classic arcade games that usually work... they require tokens, but they will refund when games eat them.   Kids love the 50 cent ice cream. Adults may not so much.   The bathrooms are a little 3rd-worldly. But that's not food so I'm not docking them a star for that. But make sure your kids go at home first!   Recommendation: call 10-15 minutes before you get there and you'll have a piping hot pizza when you arrive!"}
{"text":"I regularly go to Pizza Mart. It's a fun place with old arcade games and lots of seating. The first time I went to Pizza Mart, the old decor made me a bit wary of the food, but now I love how original it is. Pizza Mart's pizza is the best inexpensive pizza I've ever had. I love their sauce, which is fairly sweet with good tomato notes. It doesn't taste overly seasoned, which I appreciate. As a tip, I've generally found that the amount of cheese put on the pizza is better in the evening so it's good to go there for dinner rather than for lunch. The also recently changed out their ice cream machine and the ice cream isn't as good as it used to be. Overall, I think it still deserves five stars."}
{"text":"dont ever go here for great pizza , the inside of the place is awesome i wanted the food to be good too. I swear little Sleazers is better. if they dumped the pizza shit and threw a couple pooltables in there maybe a live band every onece in a while. i wish they had good pizza i live so close, I want to show them how to make a pizza i feel bad that some people have said this is whatthey consider good pizza."}
{"text":"I've been going to pizza mart since a was a baby and let me tell u never gets old .... love the pizza and it's good prices!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awful. My family and I have came here for dinner and i decided to come for lunch and too say the least this place needs a closed kitchen. The owner seems okay but his wife is the anti-Christ. Seemingly nice to my face then she scampered off into the back and talked poorly about me and my children. The pizza was alright for five bucks but the ownership needs to be changed."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Pizza Mart for over 12 years and have never had a bad experience. If you are looking for cheap and good pizza, this is the place. You can also get a soft serve cone and a beer!"}
{"text":"Pizza is cheap, but nothing too fancy.  I think a large pepperoni is still around $5, small and lunch size also starting under $4.  The quality of the pizza is much higher than you'd expect for the price and the workers are very friendly. This is a 1980's pizzeria style atmosphere, a small selection of video games, and they still sale pitchers of beer and soda.  There use to be a few west valley locations I ate at growing up, so I have some fond memories of this place.  Now it is just the Mesa location, so I stop there when I can."}
{"text":"We went to Pizza Mart on Sunday for a late lunch.  It is a cute little pizza parlor, with plenty of old school arcade games in the backroom.  Our timing wasn't the best, even though we got there around 2, as the line was fairly long and there was one person manning the register and drink station.  It took 15 min of standing in line to order our food (you order at the register then sit down and wait for your number to be called).  Our order took longer than others, we think because we ordered the deep dish.  The menu is simple, with 4-5 different specialty pizzas listed.  They don't tell you what comes on them, so we were a little surprised to see the \"Carnivore\" was just meatball and triple pepperoni.  We were expecting all the meat toppings.  For future reference, that is the \"Porker\".  The pizza itself was pretty good, not the best I've had but certainly not the worst.  I think the best part of the meal were the $0.54 soft serve cones we had for dessert.  We will definitely eat here again, we'll just be sure to order the right pizza next time."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible pizza. I took my family their and thought it was the same as it used to be in the early 90's. I was sadly mistaken. The pizza too forever to cook and when we got it, you could still see the flower in the crust, cheese half ass cooked  I went back up their with the pizza and sked, does this pizza looked cooked to you. The lady's reply was yes, that's the way it cookes. Well I'll never be going back there again"}
{"text":"The pizza here was good. The only complaint I have is that the pizza was a little doughy so we ended up putting it in our oven at home to cook a little longer and it came out delicious. The crust was crispy and the toppings were good. We would come again and hopefully get a pizza that's cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite establishments.  It is a small Mom & Pop place where the food is cooked to order, there's a salad bar, old arcade games, and booths that remind you of the good ole days when you could sit in a pizza hut.  The salad bar is lacking, and you can only make one trip.  There is a party/large family area in the back where the games are.  You can't reserve any seating, including if you want to have a birthday party here but they will provide you with plates, keep the cake cool, and silverware if you need with no extra charge.  The pizza is incredible and a large is less than $12.  My family gets a small pizza each (6 slices) with 1-4 toppings on each, and for the total of 3 of them is less than $14 with tax.  They even have a mini pizza lunch special."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going to Pizza Mart for what's got to be close to 30 years. The prices seem to have barely changed and always brings back great memories. It's not gourmet but it's great eats at unbeatable prices. Places like this are rare these days. Five stars for good pizza, good prices and for keeping it real all these years"}
{"text":"So glad this place is still around! I stopped in for lunch for the first time in at least 15 yrs and it was great. I use to come as a kid and a lot in high school and it's pretty much the same (a good thing) as it was back then. Pizzas are good and fairly cheap. Maybe I'm a biased native Mesan but I'm going to starting going out of my way to come here more regularly."}
{"text":"Been here before. Love the pizza. This time I brought the family here. We live in San tan valley and stopped in here as planned on the way to the light display at the temple. we could've gone anywhere. We chose here. Glad we chose here."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was a kid so it holds a lot of sentimental value. There are not too many places you can go to play NBA Jam, PAC Man, or Mortal Combat on old school arcade games for a quarter. But you can at Pizza Mart! It's a seat yourself and first come first serve relaxed environment. It can get pretty crowded on Friday and weekend evenings. It's an older building and not a whole lot has changed over the years. So don't expect lavish accommodations, this place is cozy. My only complaint is that like everything else, the prices have risen. But I still love this place!"}
{"text":"Do you enjoy and miss playing old school arcade games like TMNT, Galaga, and Packman? Do you enjoy cheap pizza and beer? Then this place is for you! My husband, friend, and I spent about $15 in quarters ($.25 a game) to beat the TMNT game. They have around ten other arcade games along the other wall. We had a few drinks and ordered some food in between defeating Shredder. There was also a salad bar and other various food items that we have not tried. I enjoy this establishment because it has a laid back feeling."}
{"text":"The food is a solid 3 or 4, but I'm giving it 4 because it's so cheap. There are a dozen old school, and I mean old school, video games along one wall. And boobs all around that my husband started when he was a kid, I don't think they've ever been replaced :-) we will come back for $5.50 pepperoni pizzas."}
{"text":"Have always spent family birthdays here. GREAT PIZZA. By far my favorite pizza place. Cheap and a great place for fun with the family. Friendly service and a great cheap fun place overall!"}
{"text":"Oh Pizza Mart. You were our go to place when I was a little girl growing up in Mesa. How can you beat the delicious CHEAP large pepperoni pizzas for $3.75 (back in the '80's and '90's). Then a 10 cent ice cream cone. You had the best old school video games ever. You are a true Mesa landmark!"}
{"text":"We have made it a tradition to visit Pizza Mart every two weeks to support our local business. They have great food, great service and come on, good old arcades just the place to hang out."}
{"text":"The pizza is Verry cheaply made and the cheese don't even cover the whole pizza there's only like 5 pieces of pepperoni on it, I think theyr trying to keep theyr prices cheap but it reflects on the quality of the pizza though I wouldn't go here. It doesn't even taste good becouse quality is so poor."}
{"text":"My partner grew up eating Pizza Mart, so I was anxious to try it since I am Jersey raised and always hungry for a good pizza. The place is an x iHop and nothing special on the outside- and as I waited in the car, he went in to pick up 2 pies @5 each.  I did not see the interior.  The ride hope was tedious and slow as the car was filled with the aroma of a freshly baked pie. My mouth watered and puckered and I could not resit the temptation to take a little nugget. Well, it was wonderful. I was so surprised and so happy.  By the time we got home to Central Phoenix the pizza was luke warm and yet still, I loved it. $5 for a 12\" QUALITY PIE. It was tomato-y with the perfect amount of cheese and a crisp and tasty crust. It held up and later at night as a cold pizza, it was still delicious. What more does one want ?  Well, what I want is for it be closer. However, whenever in the East Valley, I will be there. I can't speak about the rest of their offerings, but as a pizzeria, it might be the best value in the valey.  I give it 5 stars because of the taste AND value."}
