{"text":"I just ate at the Views with my friends and it was awesome. The food was unique and delicious we even met the chef Dustin as he was out talking to tables. There was just a warm feeling here I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars that's what I would do. What a freaking disappointment. The sign says dine with the dolphins and it's more like 9 table can actually do that. Sat for 20 mins before i had to ask someone to come take our order. Tables were being seated and served as we waited. Waiter came got out drink order and gave my 4 year old son a glass cup while all other kids had kids cup. He came by one time when our food was delivered. We asked for more water and he came and filled my guests water and proceeded to fill my sprite with water. I was tending to my son so I wasn't looking. My moms cauliflower steak salad was burnt. Fonzie was our waiter. There was such a disorganization with the staff and felt like our table was unassigned and this guy didn't give us the time of day. Even when he was taking our order he was looking at his other tables. I would have had a better time with the kids at johnny rockets."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend today, he surprised me with it and I loved every second! The food was amazing, the service was fanatic, and the view of the dolphins swimming and playing was so awesome! I would highly recommend everyone trying this place! Also check out the carousel arcade, it was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night before going to polar play, overall we were very happy with the food! We came in around sunset which was gorgeous and it was DEAD. And the food was good so the location must just be bad! They need more in the area, maybe shopping to help increase business! We had a window table and could see the dolphins swimming around a bit! A staff member went into the dolphin building to get something out... he turned on the lights and took his time so it was fun to see the dolphins! Maybe it would help business at this restaurant if they kept the lights on until the restaurant closes? 

Salads were imaginative and fresh (coconut strawberry vinaigrette dressing anyone??) though our server recommended the green chile which wasn't a hit. The banana donut holes were a little disappointing... definitely more crunchy than expected but overall this place was good!"}
{"text":"NOT A FOOD BASED REVIEW

Note, I didn't actually end up eating here because the service was horrible! I would only recommend you come here if you aren't hungry/have a lot of time to kill.

The restaurant was severely understaffed while we were there, 2 waiters for the whole restaurant. We were seated promptly. After ~8 minutes a waitress stopped by and said she would be right over to get us waters/take our order. We proceeded to watch 4 tables come to her with issues with their bills, we kept trying to flag her but she just wouldn't look our way. Looking around the restaurant the 2 waitresses were clearly overwhelmed and every table looked like they were looking for some form of service. 

Finally after approximately 15-20 minutes of waiting for her to come and give us water/take our order, we decided to leave. We got up and told her we could no longer wait and she couldn't have cared less."}
{"text":"Says online they close at 5:00, but by 5 they mean whenever. Me and 6 others had to change plans bc we got there at 4, be sure to call ahead if you plan on coming!"}
{"text":"Our decision to make a lunch reservation was indeed stellar! Sherrie, the house hostess, ensured we were seated at the best possible table.... Including the best view of the dolphins frolicking below us! I so enjoyed the Southwestern salad topped with grilled salmon...the dressing enhanced this dish! Also partook of the tasty sweet fries my seat mate ordered as a side to the truffle burger with brie! Our two hour lunch truly flew by watching the dolphins! Venue has invested in their adult beverage offerings, to my delight! Our dining/dolphin adventure was indeed pleasurable!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here two times now. Once when it first opened and once just last week. The service is absolutely terrible and the food is underwhelming. I chalked up the service being so bad because it had just opened the first time. The second time it was even worse. First, it took 10 minutes just standing at the front to be seated, once seated it took another 10 minutes just to get water. All this occurred with only two table being occupied in the entire restaurant (It was empty). Our original waiter disappeared and another waiter came by and took our order. Then our original waiter came back attempting to take our order. 

After a painstaking 40 minutes to get our food after ordering my ABC burger was burnt, overly salty, and just bad. Needless to say the other three people that were with me had similar complaints about their food. The only positive I can say about the food is the fries are really good.

It's a shame this restaurant turned out to be so poor. It's a unique experience to eat and watch the dolphins in Arizona."}
{"text":"I just don't understand this place. It appears to be a very nice restaurant but the menu has always completely lacked anything special. I return every couple years hoping it will get better but it doesn't. Add some variety, and an extended menu and you are sure to have a winner! Also, service was very slow on a slow weekday, during lunch."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the fries, which is pretty hard to mess up. 

The overall experience sucked. From walking to the host with his back turned to us all the way to the end of the meal it sucked. Im glad that the odysea area has more than one restaurant because I'll never come back here again. 

First off, it took about 6 minutes to get greeted and they weren't busy. I could understand if they were busy. But it was mid afternoon with 4-5 tables spread throughout 3 different servers. So not really sure why it took so long to greet us. 

Server finally brought our drinks. I ordered ketel one and soda and later found out I got well (no wonder it tasted off). My sister finished her Dr Pepper and server said she'd bring another but took over 15 min to bring another after my sister reminded her. She didn't apologize or anything just said oh yeah sure. 

The menu sounded pretty good. But I was craving a burger, so I got one. My $15 burger sucked and was not worth it. I ordered medium rare, as usual and it had no pink whatsoever. If I'm spending $15 on a burger I expect it to at least be how I wanted it cooked. One of my sisters got the turkey burger which was $12 worth of bun, american cheese, some sauce and a turkey patty. My other sis got a truffle burger which had no pink either. 

Overall I spent $70 on crap. I will not be back. Server was bad. Food was not worth it. $4 for a watered down Dr Pepper. $8 for well vodka even though I wanted premium vodka. If I'm paying $70 on a lunch I expect it to be good with good service. This place was lacking all of that. 

We have annual passes for the aquarium. So, let's just say we shall be trying the other restaurants next time and not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The cocktails are amazing.  The view of the Valley is so different than any venue you will find in Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Dolphins playing while you eat, clearly chef driven menu items.  I love their street tacos, cauliflower steak salad, and pork cristo, but you can't order a bad item.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This review is not based on the food but the short time we were inside the restaurant. 

My kids and I stopped here to look at a menu and we wanted to see if it lived up to the \"views\" name. We walked over to the window to take a look and were standing there for all of 30 seconds when the hostess came over and told us looking is not free. She was very rude and explained to us that if all patrons just wanted to look then everyone would crowd by the window. 
I can understand the logic behind what she was saying but she went about it the wrong way and continued to make rude comments to us until we left. 
I would not visit again based on the poor short experience I had and reading that other had a less than excellent experience with their customer service as well.
For a restaurant that has a kids menu and it in a complex geared toward family fun, I am surprised by the lack of customer service and plain decency. 

If your family is looking for a more kid friendly and cheaper option visit OPA where kids eat free and get a cute kids cup with their meal or humble pie. Skip the rude and expensive peanut butter jelly at Views."}
{"text":"Service was not so great... walked into two locked doors and when we finally found a door that was open there was a desk blocking people from getting in. Now being that we were with an elderly person in a wheel chair this is a bit of a problem... the person that helped us through the door was a fellow patron that was waiting, not a person that worked here. So we waited for someone to greet us and after 5 minutes we finally grabbed someone to see if we can get a table, we did want a table to see the dolphins so we decided to wait for one of the 8 to open up, the woman that was finally helping us ask us to sit in a waiting area. After a while a table opened up and we thought we would be seated and to our dismay they were about to give our table away, so my mother went to check with someone now posted at the front desk and he proceeded to tell us that 2 other tables are waiting to be seated and we would be after them... my mother was livid and she searched out the young woman that asked us to wait (wasn't hard to find her out of the 5 people that work here) and she had to talk to the man that told us we had to wait. Finally we were seated and I'm currently writing this at the table in awe that such an esteemed company MODREN GROOVE is running a restaurant like this with such TERRIBLE service! 

As a small business owner I will NOT be recommending this restaurant to my patrons and clients. Let's hope that this food is spectacular to save a possible star. 

Update: food was great and met expectations the service was not good still the waitress checked on us once aside from taking our order, and she checked on us after we had made a complaint to the manager that fuzz was cooked in some of our fries (which manager offered new fries but we did not want anymore and they DIDN'T take off the bill.) NOT GOOD SERVICE AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times. The first time, the service was so so, not very memorable. Today, the service was terrible. It was 1:20 pm and the hostess seated us right away but beyond that it quickly went downhill from there. It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks (water and iced tea), but wait, the server did say, \"I didn't forget about your drinks.\"  So, I guess that made everything all right. At one point, I got up from my seat to check on our order and another server ran into me. I said, \"sorry.\" She gave me a dirty look like I was in her way and kept walking. My husband asked me if SHE said sorry and I said, \"no.\" We really should have left at this point, but alas, 30 minutes later and no word from our server, my husband finally talked to the hostess about the status of our order. We told her that we were going to leave if the food wasn't ready and she called over our server. Mind you, we only ordered a bruschetta board and the ABC burger. I don't know why the server didn't bring the appetizer first. He brought both the appetizer and entree out at the same time. The server's excuse for the food coming out so late? \"It was beyond our control.\" I really dislike excuses. And also don't say, \"I'm only a server.\" You are the face of the business. Take accountability and don't argue with your customer.  He brought the check to let us know that he comped the appetizer, but we feel the only reason we got a comp is because I expressed my discontent to the hostess and server. Once poor customer service is evident, it takes a lot more than just a free appetizer to make things better especially after the fact. Oh and it doesn't stop here though, he asked if I wanted a to go box and I wasn't even done eating yet. Nice... Thank you so much for rushing me out after we waited an eternity for our food."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we walked in so I was little worried, but food and service was fantastic. We had a group of 6 and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"For being open for only about a month this place really surprised me. Normally I don't like to go to new places until a good 6months has passed. The wahoo sandwich I had was AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and watching the dolfins play as we ate just made it even better."}
{"text":"I thought I'd reviewed before but it's not showing up.  We've been many times and always enjoy our food.  The portions are large and flavorful.

I never go out to eat on holidays or peak times, we're always in and out in an hour unless we dawdle.  Everyone was very nice and professional.  I really enjoy watching the Dolphin show when we drop in at noon or 6pm.

Let's talk food. I'm gluten free and have pork allergy, so that limits my options.  Today I had salmon and fruited rice which was delicious.  I miss the Wahoo and am hoping it's in season in the Fall.  The menu is seasonal which is actually something I really like but I'm always sad when seasons change lol.  The burgers are awesome and great portions.  My husband had the kale fruit salad today which was huge!  He always has a lot to choose from.  I'd like to see more gluten free dessert options and a lighter fish.  I really enjoy salmon as the maple almond glaze was yummy but I'd like another lighter fish choice.

I have yet to try the High Top which looks to have similar menu, but have been to Docktails which has some tasty options and same views"}
{"text":"I've been many times before and the food is very good but the service is AWFUL! Every time we go, we sit at the tables waiting for someone to come up and take our order until we cant wait anymore and have to go up to the counter. If they want you to go up the the counter and order, they should tell you when you sit down so you aren't waiting for 45 minutes. They also aren't very friendly. I never here \"hellos\" or \"Thank yous\" out of the 4 times we have gone. Yesterday they brought our food to us, placed it on the table and left. Not a single word to us. Not impressed with service and it needs to be improved very soon."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!!  A perfect ending to a day at the aquarium.  Not at all like what others complained about.  We went in because of the gluten-free menu. We sat by the window and watched the dolphins being trained.  What a show!  Our server, Cody, was attentive, very sweet and went out of his way to accommodate my daughter's gluten allergy.  He talked to the chef and he accommodated her by changing the way her food was cooked because of her allergy.  She was able to relax, confidant that she would not get sick. The food was fresh and very tasty!  We had the Bruschetta platter (SO good!), scrumptious butternut squash soup, a very good bacon cheeseburger and great loaded potato skins.  We recommend it highly because of the excellent food and service. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went with my family on Mother's Day. We are annual pass holders at the aquarium and had spent a lovely day there and were looking for a late afternoon meal and wanted to watch the dolphins. The great view is the only reason for 2 stars. The service was horrendous. We were asked to wait for a few minutes while they cleaned a table off. Out of six tables by the windows, four were dirty and the rest of the restaurant was empty. 
We were sat at around 3:45 and I needed to go wash my hands before I ate. I had barely sat back down when the server wanted to take our order. I explained that I hadn't even looked at the menu yet, but we'd all have waters. I asked my teenagers what they wanted to drink and sent them to wash their hands. The server was back to take our order again after only a couple minutes. I ordered a cocktail for myself. My husband got a Diet Coke, my son a Dr. Pepper, and my daughter a Coke. She got all three of their drinks wrong and wasn't even sure which was which, nor did she care. Again she pushed to take our order. I had a couple of questions about ingredients that she couldn't answer, but still need to look as the menu was different from the one posted online. She clearly was irritated that we hadn't walked in ready to order and get out of her way, even though we'd been there less than ten minutes. When she came back with the answers to my questions, she didn't even bother to look at us. We started to order. When I asked for the chicken she bluntly informed me they were out. I said it would have been nice if she'd led with that. She abruptly said she'd just found out, so.... what else did I want? She made it clear she wanted to be off work instead of doing her job. I was frustrated and told her I'd need more time. We've never felt so unwelcome, even my teens were uncomfortable. She then disappeared. After several minutes, we decided to pay for our drinks and go somewhere else. She was completely avoiding us at this point and I had to flag her down to ask for the manager. 
The first thing out of the manager's mouth after I explained the situation was to point out how busy they'd been that day. I informed him that I'd spent 15 years of my life serving and I knew what busy holidays were like, but that was no excuse for rudeness and rushing patrons. I also don't understand how a restaurant can run out of mashed potatoes for one of their signature dishes before 4 pm on what they know will be a busy day. I told him we were not comfortable staying, we would pay for our drinks and go. He said the drinks were on him but could he convince us to stay. I was firm, but told him we were pass holders and would consider trying another time. Then he kind of got defensive, asking why we just couldn't give them another chance, as if WE were being unreasonable. At that point we were just done. 
The view of the dolphins is spectacular, but the service is terrible and management has issues too. Not to mention, that even though we are foodies, the menu came off as overly pretentious and as full of self importance as the staff. Went next door to Pangaea Dinosaur Grill and had an amazing experience. Check that review as well."}
{"text":"We visited this location during a rather quiet day. Why we were out in 115 degree heat is another story...

When we entered it was clearly not busy, but all tables looking over the dolphins were filled. Not their problem but was a bummer anyways. Happy for those that got the view. We were able to look through the windows without interrupting other table though. 

Sadly the atmosphere is nothing short of lacking. Hardly any tables and just poor design. Tables a very widely spaced which causes a \"tiny furniture in a huge space\" feel. Very unfortunate curtain placement which allows the staff to hide behind said curtain...

About the staff hiding...not only did we not have a waiter come to our table for the better part or 10 minutes but he would disappear for 15+ minutes at a time. We ordered a kids meal, two salads and a sandwich. It took nearly 30 minutes to get the food to the table. I have been to pretty nice steak houses in which it took less time to get a perfectly cooked meal. At the end of our meal I asked for the check and our waiter again disappeared. I had to eventually ask a host to provide the check since I couldn't find our waiter...turns out he was hiding behind the aforementioned curtain. Prior to asking for the check he asked if we would like any dessert or anything else, we said no and just the check. After finally getting the check from the host, our waiter magically reappeared and asked again if we wanted anything more...

The BBQ Chicken sandwich had a pretty tough bun, well over grilled chicken and hardly any pineapple. I will say though, the fries were pretty good. Salads were enjoyed by those who ordered them. 

Overall, the food unfortunately just doesn't make up for the lack of atmosphere or service. I truly hope it was just an off day, but based on the other reviews I have now read I don't think it is...bummer."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day and this place is strange. We walk in and the hostess podium is right in front of the door blocking entry, no one greeted us despite the fact many employees running around, it seemed empty but the staff looked very panicked. Finally I walked in pushing the podium a bit and said hi to one of the members who wasn't even attending to customers and saw us but didn't acknowledge our presence and mentioned that we had a reservation. So we got seated. 

The layout of the restaurant is very strange, lots of empty space and all tables were pushed towards the window for a view of the Delphine's, which was nice but the space looked wonky.

Ordered drinks and water, while the rest of our group was still not there, and once we were all in we ordered our food. Water was filled once and if I had not asked, it may have not been filled again, server \"Brenden- I think\" was very nice and smiled but was not attentive, which made me think there is a problem somewhere that his attention and the rest of the staff for that matter was there. 

I think they were all trying hard but something distracted them. 

I ordered the turkey burger with sweet potato mash and my mom ordered the southwest salad with salmon. Burger was not good, it had no flavor and somewhat dry. The sweet potato mash was good. Mom loved her salad. Will give it time and come back on a day that's not a holiday and try them out again."}
{"text":"Good food, but very poor service.

I ordered the happy hippie bowl, which was delicious! It had chipotle sweet potato mash with a grilled piece of tofu and a southwest salsa. My husband got the spicy sausage flatbread, which I ended up also loving.

We went on a holiday weekend, though, and they ended up being super crazy busy. We waited over 10 minutes for them to refill our waters, and had to ask twice. 

It is pretty cool to look over the dolphin exhibit, and the food was very tasty. We would come back here, but it's not my favorite place."}

{"text":"Went here with friends a few days ago, had a great time watching dolphins while you eat. The food was great and our waitress was better. I cant understand the negative reviews everything was done very well. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow.. Where do I start. We came in last friday early evening. Maybe 10-12 customers in the place. Very unique decor that my wife and I both mentioned as different and interesting looking pieces. Like a glass table with silver balls that form a rectangle that the glass sits on. All nice stuff just a little different. Like I said \"unique\"... 
  We were seated and the server came by after a few minutes. I stated that the plan was for an app and a couple drinks. We ordered the drinks while looking over the apps. 5-7 min went by without even seeing our server. When she appeared from around the corner she told us the drinks were going to be a little longer because they had get something in order to make on of the drinks. She poured us some water and we ordered the app. We ordered the chorizo corn fonduta. 
   So while we waited for our app and drinks we looked out the large windows to see if there were any dolphins to view. Unfortunately, we couldn't see anything, only somebody cleaning the pool. 
  Sooooo, the server came back and informed us that my drink wasn't going to happen. They didn't have all the ingredients. And then she asked if we wanted to order dinner! WHAT???

  At that point I said I'm just going to leave. My wife and I have never walked out of anyplace before and this was our friday night. I wasn't gonna ruin it because of this place.  The server was apologetic and said it was her first \"day on the floor\". 
  So we stayed for the 2 drinks and app. The app was ok. Cheese are already hard and the spinach was clumped together. Didn't have the \"freshly made\" appearance. More like warmed up. 
  The hostess (floor mgr?) walked over to the table next to us to ask how their meal was. Turned around and didn't say a word to us. We paid our bill and I walked out before my wife. As a passed the podium the hostess was standing there and didn't say a word. I stepped outside and waited for my wife and the door was open. Again, as she walked by nothing was said. We won't be back. THE WORST SERVICE I've had in years. There are too many GREAT places to eat. At this rate, this place will be shuttered by next summer."}
{"text":"I was walking around this new center and looking for a place to take my in-laws from out of state. We were waiting to go to the aquarium. We went when it wasn't crowded to look at a menu, and we wanted to walk into the restaurant to see what the views were like of dolphinaris. I was not greeted by the host, but rather yelled at and told I needed to move and return to the front because I was not allowed to see what the view was like until I ordered food. I was then told the only way to see dolphinaris was to dine in this restaurant or to actually go swim with them. I found this not to be true because there is a bar downstairs where you can watch. The menu looked fantastic and I would have loved to take my in laws in there but after the hostess was so rude and not welcoming at all, decided to dine at the docktails bar. Staff is a big first impression and this was an awful experience. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch here after a morning at the aquarium. Although I can't remember our servers name, he did an amazing job. Someone said it was his first day and he rocked it! Very attentive staff! We had the wahoo sandwich and the cuban...enjoyed both. The honeydew margarita was also delightful! Our view, by the window, was pretty spectacular watching the dolphins and trainers frolic with guests. Our little guy definitely liked watching them below. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"So the fiance and i were curious about this place. Decided to make a drop after looking through yelp of this place. Saw the negatives but still wanted to give it a try. View with dolphins. Cmon. Dolphins in the middle of the dessert. Really? Im from california. Service was pretty attentive and the gentleman server was real nice. The food which i got the abc burger and the fiance got the flatbread margherita with goat cheese. They werr both amazing. Had my meat cook medium well and it was so juicy. The battered fries were real good as well. The decor of this place looks so much like some pop up restaurant but still nice. There seems to be a bar on the other side. Prob a evening thing and looks to be a place where you can reserve for events. Something to consider if i was maybe wanting a place to hold a reception. Hehe. Possibilities. Despite some of the negative reviews. I believe its worth a try. My fiance and i had a good experience. Thank you MG!"}
{"text":"Didn't even make it to a table the receptionist was very rude. In for vacation thought we would check this place out. Walked in asked for a menu and she threw the menu and walked off. How unprofessional and rude. Won't be spending my money here ever."}
{"text":"We heard amazing things about eating next to the dolphins show so we decided to go as it is great for kids. This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever encountered. First there are people everywhere and there is no organization with their staff so we went up and asked if it is open seating and all they say is ya. So we found a table after ten minutes which was to be expected but once we sat down the table was never cleaned. We we're not acknowledged for about 15 minutes. And the first encounter that we did have with a team member was to say that our water bottles are not allowed. So we asked if they could be poured into cups which the server did. Then we waited another 15 minutes to be acknowledged for menus, drink orders, Etc. I actually asked 3 times if our order could be taken. And she kept saying, \"I'll be right there.\" Finally eent up to the bar and asked and he gave me attitude. Another server came over after our order was taken and realized we didn't have any Cutlery or dishware so she quickly wiped up the table and then took the glasses of water she had just poured for us away. We waited another 20 minutes to get our actual food after our drinks didn't arrive for about 10 minutes after we ordered. There was absolutely no management or oversight for this restaurant whatsoever and it was very obvious. Food was okay. Really really poorly done. Especially coming from out of town. I hope your organization reads this and makes major changes."}
{"text":"Walked in to check out the venue for a group party and walked to the window to check out the \"view\" which is a shallow dolphin pool. The older blonde woman quickly rushed over and was extremely rude. she was the hostess, I'm guessing after seeing other reviews and hearing others' experience with her. As we talked with her about the potential to host a party there, she remained rude. Needless to say we will NOT be back to spend a dime there."}
{"text":"We sat next to the window. We had amazing views and food was delicious!!!  Watching the dolphins was so much fun."}
{"text":"AWFUL service. Will not come back. Food was just ok. Kids menu is a complete joke. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"Honestly everyone wants to eat at this restaurant that's pretty new to the aquarium. Due to the view of the Dolphins hence the name. I went in for my best friend's son's 3rd birthday and soon as we walked in I felt a Vibe not only from the people that were employed there but from the other guests that it was just not a situation for kids to be involved in which whatever could have been up to me to leave or to stay but I chose to stay because it was not my call but as soon as I walked in a host or a floor manager whatever she was was completely dismissive and absolutely rude. I truly didn't even want to bring myself to writing a Yelp review. The service was dismissive just like it was walking into the restaurant. They had to push two large Circle tables together to be equivalent to a 7 top which was very awkward because within the circle tables at least two to three people don't have a space to eat and have to eat with their neighbor so that was kind of annoying. The host or the floor manager whatever she was was easily irritated and rude to every Factor about my friend's son's birthday party lunch. The service was lackadaisical and I wish that I could say something then but he was honestly the innocent one because the bad vibes were all on the woman that welcomed us into the restaurant. But he honestly couldn't seem to get anything right. Even though we prepped him with every modification so that we could be in and out and go back to the aquarium because we have kids and we just wanted to adjust to the vibe of this place. There was one point in the lunch after waiting 20 minutes for my appetizers and my drinks that I said something to the host / floor manager still don't know her title or her name, and I walked out with my child that was impatient because that's just what kids are not on them and she said can I help you with something like she's never seen me before, and I said yeah actually I've been missing a drink and some appetizers for the lunch for my friend's son's birthday and she immediately walked away. When I got back from taking my son on a walk to calm down my friends had told me that she slammed items on the table aggressively which they didn't even know what I had said to her or if I even had talked to her in general. When our food 2nd course came not even 2 minutes after I got back the appetizers weren't even on the table for 4 minutes. Keep in mind I did order the kids food all three of their kids meals prior to the appetizer and everything just piled on top of one another. Items were missing I had to send him on many trips because he was in a rush it wasn't even busy. At a certain point I just stopped making eye contact and just said please and thank you. My favorite part to the whole situation that is obviously a negative comment is that she started windexing the windows were the view of the Dolphins are right where all three of the kids were seated. Knowing that they're going to go back up and touch the window again like she was irritated with the fact that we were even there just trying to move us in and move us out once again hostess/ floor manager. I'll choose Johnny's humble or pangea next time. Or pay the fee for the docktails."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a horrible rating, and always like to give the person the benefit of doubt, but this restaurant had HORRIBLE customer services. We walked in, restaurant just opened, there was a gentleman at the front who was very pleasant and let us look at the menu first before deciding to eat there. We liked what we saw, and decided to eat there. The hostess then walked towards us, told us to put the menus we were holding in our hands down (very rudely), and that she can't accommodate a table by the window with a stroller, then proceeding walking right past us and expected us to follow her to a table. Unbelievably rude. First of all, you're telling your customers to put the menu down and \"follow me.\" Then you say you can't accommodate us with a table by the window when we haven't even uttered a single WORD yet, and on top of that, you really think we would want to eat here now? My husband and I turned to leave, and she followed us out and said they have a table, they just can't put us by the window....hostess is absolutely clueless on how to treat customers. VERY RUDE. She really thought it was the location of the table that angered us, and had nothing to do with her mannerisms. 

We ended up eating at a pizza place three restraints down who provided great customer service - above and beyond, even asked us if we wanted water to go for our little one.

For reviewers out there looking for a place to eat, I would rate this a zero if yelp would allow me. The restaurant had just opened, only 1 other family was dining, and we were only a party of 2 with a 1 year old (who was asleep). The place was not busy. There was no reason a hostess should behave in that way."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food was fine, but we ordered a burger and it was very fatty, and not a lot of meat was in the burger. Also, the service was slow. The \"view\" was the dolphin pool, and when we were there, there wasn't a show."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week and this place has one of the best menus I've seen. Their food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. I ordered a their turkey burger and it was phenomenal. We also ordered their tater skins and their southwest salad and we absolutely loved everything. To top everything off, we got to enjoy our lunch while watching dolphins play the entire time. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Creative dishes with great flavor and a good view of the Dolphins. Husband and I shared the hot honey chicken and Sonoran tater skins!"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes to get a table near the window to watch the dolphins. Once seated, we then waited another 10 minutes before we left... no one stopped to ask if we would like water or even acknowledged us. Terrible service. Walked out and went to another restaurant nearby for lunch"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Our server was on top of the service. I had the Wahoo! Grilled fish sandwich which was excellent. My adult daughter had the tortilla strip salad and a side of fries. She raved about the salad. Their fries were much to our liking.  A few quirks. Read on...

We arrived at 11 am Sunday opening time as I was intent on sitting by the window wall overlooking the dolphin pools, which proved wel-worth the effort. Totally loved seeing the dolphins. I ordered a bloody Mary, which was acceptable, but not as, how should I say it, as well-crafted as I had hoped it would be. It was basically BM mix and vodka with a lime.   I was hoping for a celery stalk and a few other little tickle-my-fancy items like a carrot curl or something, anything. One practice there I found weird: they present the check in a children's book at meal end (mine: Bob The Builder [no time to read it]). For one, the decor is lovely, sophisticate soft modern -- not child-themed whatsoever unless you count the dolphins at play outside. For another, the book for possible restless kids is served at meal-end and is returned to waitress with your payment method. What is that about? It is not cute, you can't keep it, and it doesn't fit the theme, making it a rotten idea. With that said, I'll return for the excellent food and dolphin views."}
