{"text":"Inside fiesta mall's food court upstairs we found this pleasant surprise. Amazingly tasty Mediterranean food that is cooked fresh. $4.99 for chicken shawarma plate and $6.99 for chicken and beef kabob combo.  Both came with rice,  salad and hamas.  Very polite and friendly owners,  from Iraq. If you want Mediterranean food,  this is it. Thank you owners.   I am writing this review while eating my food.  It is so good . :)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and authentic! Services is great as well. Favorite place for Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"I really wish this place would have a location outside of the mall. Just because food places at fiesta mall dont seem to last very long. But this place is SO GOOD! The customer service was excellent and the food was amazing. Great prices and good portions.  I will def be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, what a great surprise! Everything was fresh, affordable and super tasty. I will definitely be back, yum"}
{"text":"Definitely a surprise that such good food is in fiesta mall. Great price and even better food."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Got the chicken shawarma plate. It comes with salad, hummus, and the chicken on a bed of rice. The hummus was smooth and very tasty, the salad was crisp and freah, and the price cannot be beat. I also ordered a pita and some baba ganoush. 5 stars all the way. Im so glad i found this place!"}
{"text":"this was the absolute BEST falafel I've ever had and for so cheap? amazing. excellent vegetarian options. I've found my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"The chicken schwarma is awesome!  Filling and very affordable. My boyfriend and I got the same tHing and a large drink, came out to 13 bucks.  Always looks dead though, seems like they don't get as much business. Which is crazy cause its delishhh"}
{"text":"Located inside a ghost town of a mall, you'll find this hidden treasure.   Talk about reasonable prices. $4.99 for a large plate of their chicken schwarma. And it's excellent!  For mall food, Sahara Express is something special. I just hope that survives the mall seemingly closing down around it, and if they are forced out of there, that they're able to relocate somewhere decent and keep cooking up the best (and only I know of) Iraqi food in town."}
{"text":"I just loved this place when I was here in 2013 and 14. It got to be the only place I would eat when I came to the shopping center. When I came back in January of 2017 I was so very disappointed to find that they had closed. If the owners happen to see this and they have opened another restaurant somewhere, I hope they will contact me on yelp.com through messages and let me know if they have another location so I can try to patronize it if it's not too far away. They always gave a huge amount of food for a very reasonable price.   I noticed out of 21 reviews they have 5 Stars across the board as their overall rating so I don't understand why they would close unless they lost their lease or were able to move on to a better location. Everything I ever got here was wonderful, and the owners were always so nice.  The prices were so reasonable I used to order food to go along with what I ate in the cafeteria style seating area just so I could have some to eat for the next couple of days. Everything was always seasoned perfectly and their sauces were wonderful.   I wish the owners the very best in whatever their future endeavors are and hope that I can reconnect with them at a new restaurant someday."}
{"text":"Was in the East Valley and was craving some Middle Eastern food. Found this place on Yelp. I was a little skeptical about going to the mall food court. I am so glad I did. Great family business with amazing prices and rockin food! Ordered the mix combo and loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Today, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Combo after having samples the past few days. The marinated chicken was full of flavor and was served over a bed of yellow short grained rice. It was served with garlic mayo. It also came with a side salad and hummus! It tasted delicious and it only cost $4.99."}
{"text":"What a terrific jewel discovered in my old mall!  It was just about closing time, but the owners were happy to make rich, flavorful falafel, and savory beef saaj plates.   My wife and I loved both dishes (the beef saaj is tasty, though very familiar - not particularly exotic - it is basically shawarma spiced beef in a pressed & toasted tortilla). The hummus was really lovely - just the right spiciness along with fresh pita.   Sahara Express seems like a few other restaurants I've seen started by optimistic and generous entrepreneurs - very often after a little while the quality goes down and the prices go up. I hope that doesn't happen here, but in the meantime it really seems they are providing excellent quality and charging as little as they can, and I think they should be rewarded for it.   Love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"I saw great ratings coming from a restaurant in the food court of Fiesta Mall and couldn't resist trying it.  It was so good and a ridiculously good deal.  Everything is done a little bit differently than most of the mainstream chain style places.  I especially enjoyed the just a little chunky baba ghanoush."}
{"text":"An amazing find! This is way to good for a mall! Our son actually stopped eating his beloved panda express lunch after he had one bite of their chicken shawarma. The portions were generous so sharing with his appetite was not a problem. The staff was friendly. I cant wait till we go back."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at Fiesta Mall, definitely a hidden gem.  We wanted take out for a Saturday evening am this place was perfect.  The chicken shawerma was so good!  Served on a delightful bed of saffron rice and a side of buttery hummus and salad.  If you're looking for Middle Eastern takeout, give this place a try. We loved it."}
{"text":"I ordered the shwarma based off the reviews as well as the beef and chicken plate, and falafel. Everything was quick and of course, delicious. The garlic sauce they give you ties everything together, as does the hot green sauce. I came here looking for the Phoenix equivalent to New York's \"Halal Guys\" (Google it, they're amazing) and this was the closest I've come. The chicken was flavorful and moist. The falafel was unbelievably light but still crispy, the rice was cooked perfectly and not sticky whatsoever, and the white sauce, like I said.. is awesome. The people working are also great even though I was not expecting service from a mall fast food establishment. I hope they do not move, or if they do, to somewhere right next to my house! The people and food here are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton and walked  past several restaurants to eat at the Sahara Express. I chose the number seven (chicken schwarma) with a couple extra pitas and a bottle of water. The bill was eight dollars and the experience was fantastic. The Sharma came out hot, freshly cooked and delectable! I've eaten a lot of entr√©es in sealable Styrofoam containers but this is absolutely my favorite!  I'm a sucker for rice and their saffron rice was some of the best I've ever had!  The salad, too, was infused with mint that was surprising. Delicious!   I had a discussion with the worker/owner after I finished, thanking him for such a wonderful meal. He said they're looking for a new location because the mall seems to be a dead end."}
{"text":"Super nice. Guy was working alone he brought my order out to me because it was a slow day. They also brewed the tea correctly so it doesn't taste like mud like most places. Everything was fresh and cooked well and I will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ate gyros here and they were good.  This is exactly what I would expect from an in-mall food experience.  The counter folks were very friendly and the service was quick.  It's a little expensive for the quality of food they were offering.  If you want to pay this price there are better Mediterranean food choices around and close by 85202 in West Mesa."}
{"text":"New place that has taken over is called,  M&D Gyros. The flavour of the regular Gyro is really good and the serving of meat is very generous...really liked their falafel as well. Staff is really friendly and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I had a side of chicken shwarma it was amazing with their garlic sauce I did not have any of the vegetables or hummus"}
