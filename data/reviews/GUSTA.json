{"text":"Great, artisanal vegan sausages. I stocked up on several varieties of sausages before leaving on lengthy road/camping trip. I thought the price was reasonable and I was impressed by how well the sausages kept in my cooler (even though I was pretty lazy about replenishing the ice) and how well they grilled. All of the sausages lasted long enough to make it into my belly and all were delicious--really, they were as good as any I've had and I've been vegan for twenty years. I confess I enjoyed visiting the store, too. The employee behind the counter was kind and helpful, and it was fun for this longtime vegan to have something of a butcher shop experience. If I were lucky enough to live in Montréal, I suspect Gusta would be my go-to for backyard barbecues."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Monday (they open at 11am).
Is it unreasonable to expect to put your order in within 1/2 hour wait?
11:30, we ask staff at what time can we expect to be served lunch?  Couldn't tell us what time our food would be ready 
We left and it will be awhile before I go back"}
{"text":"I was taken here by a friend of mine. I walked in and immediately loved it. If your a Vegan who can't handle soy like me then this is the place for you ! I haven't had a Hot Dog in forever and I finally had an amazing Vegan Hot Dog. Try it at once !!! 

They have an amazing menu and most of the Vegan options are made from Wheat Protein. They make both their own meats and cheese's so it super nice to support the local business's. I bought some sausages and it's better to by then in a bunch as they are cheaper that way. 

The cutest thing was in the bathroom you could go in and you can write on the wall with chalk anything that you like at all."}
{"text":"They are at the Christmas market located between the Complexe des Jardins and the Place des Arts. Their vegan chocolate milk is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is amazing! I've previously bought Gusta vegan sausages at the store so I knew they were delicious but the meals they make here are out of this world! The staff is very friendly and informative. You can tell they're proud of the food there and they have every reason to be. Even if you're not a vegan you can appreciate the taste. McD's has nothing on this place. You can also buy the cheese and sausages straight from the source!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich on earth! The sausage, cheese and tofu are perfectly spiced, and then the burrito is thrown in a panini maker. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoy the vegan sausages here, and it's so fun to have a sit-down, delicious vegan place in the market. I went here today when I had to pick up some markety things and got hit with a craving. I love the pretzel buns so much, they are so soft and chewy and really hold up to the onslaught of toppings. The chipotle kimchi and sauerkraut both taste homemade and awesome. The sausages are made with gluten science and spices, and taste pretty great, and hold up well on the barbeque. You can grab bags of them uncooked here so it's a super sweet option when you're shopping with friends and want to have the classic summer experience without the meat sweats. 

Service when I've been here has been quick, friendly and helpful. I ordered at the calendar without a wait, gave them my name and had my dog in minutes. Delicious, super glad Gusta is around."}
{"text":"L'entreprise montréalaise GUSTA est reconnue pour ses fameuses saucisses et fromages véganes. Elle sera très probablement aussi bientôt appréciée pour son menu: en effet, depuis mars 2017, GUSTA est désormais aussi un restaurant!
La fabrique, située à quelques pas du marché Jean-Talon, dispose de quelques places assises et offre un petit menu \"comfort food\". Ici, pas de bol ou de salade santé: on y retrouve un grilled cheese, 2 sortes de cheeseburger (Big GUSTA et BBQ), une salade César et, surtout, un kebab! La broche vaut d'ailleurs le détour: c'est la première du genre à Montréal.
Les prix sont bas (comptez de 5 à 6$ pour un sandwich) et l'établissement et le service sont agréables et sans prétention. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un repas complet, je vous recommande le kebab et une petite salade César en accompagnement. Évidemment, l'ensemble des saucisses et fromages de GUSTA sont aussi en vente sur place.
Je croise les doigts pour que le menu et l'offre globale de GUSTA se développent au fil du temps: il y a beaucoup de potentiel!"}
{"text":"J,adore la marque GUSTA depuis que je l'ai découverte au Canada, et je suis particulièrement fan du fromage à gratiner et donc c'était un peu une obligation de passer par leur restaurant qui fait également office de magasin et je ne regrette pas ! J'ai testé le brunch composé de pancakes, de patates, de minis burgers accompagnés de salade et de sirop d'érable avec café a volonté. C'était vraiment délicieux (j'ai particulièrement aimé les pommes de terre). J'ai également pu gouter au cheese burger que mon copain avait pris et c'était pas mal bon aussi. 
La carte propose pas mal de plat (j'ai hâte d'y retourner pour gouter le Hot dog !), et il est impossible de repartir sans faire le plein de fromage ou de saucisses vegans!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice and tried 2 different burgers and the patates.  I was a little confused at first that you can buy the sausage in bulk or prepacked but you cannot have them cook it for you there at all. 

I first got the barbecue cheeseburger and patates. The bun was nice and soft and the flavour of the burger was really tasty. The potatoes and dip were really tasty but not enough dip is included for the whole batch. 

The next time I tried the Big Gusta which is supposed to be kind of like a Big Mac. I didn't really think so and didn't enjoy the flavours of this burger as much. 

I had a bite of the donair and it was ok, I definitely preferred the barbecue cheeseburger if I was going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast burrito. I loved it. Instead of me describing it - just go try for yourself. You won't be disappointed. And it even comes with a free cup of coffee! The sausage in bretzel bun was OK. Next time I also want to try the vegan kebab, burger, and caesar salad. The tables inside look quite hip, the outside seating could be improved to give it more character and make it more comfortable."}
{"text":"This was an extremely pleasant surprise, I encountered GUSTA at the Place Des Arts event and  immediately was hooked. My wife is Vegan and I am a vegetarian so finding a good vegan place makes us both happy. We tried their hot dogs and those were by far the best vegan dogs I had ever tasted. They topped it with delicious caramelized onion and had so many vegan sauced to add which made this dish just WOW. If you ever go to their place or see them selling in an event dont even think twice and for 6$ a dog this is a wonderful deal. Vegan good for the body and for the soul :)"}
{"text":"Excellente saucisses végétariennes! (Essayez le kebab deluxe aussi.) Super bon. Et pratique pour quand tu veux aussi acheter des légumes au Marché Jean-Talon. À côté de Juliette et Chocolat dans le nord du marché sur la petite rue qui est normalement piétonne."}
