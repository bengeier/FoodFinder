{"text":"Best Thai food in Central Phoenix! Service is fast and friendly, food is delicious, and prices are reasonable. Make sure to get a Thai tea!"}
{"text":"They are having a soft opening and the Pad-See-Ew was phenomenal.  I asked for medium to spicy and thought as I asked, 'what are you that guy who can't make up his mind between medium and medium rare?' Well it was perfect and I will be back.   I also tried the Thai tea, worth the calories and caffeine.  Nice authentic family business with great prices and 5-star for hospitality and food."}
{"text":"We just got back from a trip to Thailand and were needing a fix.  This was good!  The chicken satay and peanut sauce was on point.  The Panang curry had excellent flavor!  Beautiful place and great service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent food, great decor, and wonderful prices. Come hungry! I've never had a bad meal there. My personal favorite is the Pad Thai, with either egg rolls or crab puffs. The Thai Tea is amazing too. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened up next to my office recently and we couldn't be happier! I've been looking for good Thai food in the area and this is it. They lunch specials are amazing, they come with pad Thai plus a choice of entr√©e and soup and the portions are generous. Interior is beautiful, it's a former wine bar but works really well for a tire restaurant. Staff was very friendly and the service was great. Spice was bland and I they didn't ask you for spice level upon ordering, if you like things spicy, I think you have to ask for it. I got the red curry  and pad Thai and both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Some neighbors had posted about this place. I love Thai food, so I wanted to give it a shot. I'm so glad that I did!  By far, my new favorite!  The decor is awesome. The people who run the place are super sweet, and it's clear they live what they do.  The dishes are beautiful, and the food is top notch!  The Panang was some of the best I've had.  I judge Thai food by the Mango Sticky rice, and this was the best I've ever had. Hands down.  So excited about this new neighborhood treasure!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Even though the Tom Kha soup is not as spicy as I usually like it, the flavor is amazing. I've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants in Phoenix- easily in the top three. Reasonably priced, big portions."}
{"text":"Good but you'll pay for it. Expensive for the portions. I know cheaper places in town that taste just as good."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since its walking distance from my house but it was just not good. Tom Yum was way funky tasting and the red curry was just okay."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful. Small language barriers but nothing one would not expect dining in a Thai restaurant. 

The food is wonderful, quickly prepared, and fresh.

Highly recommended. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Delicious soup. Lunch specials. Everything great except the music was kind of lame and then they replaced it buy some silly TV travel video which I could've lived without."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise when we decided to try this place this afternoon.  Food was amazing.  Best Thai food we've found in AZ so far.  My half-Thai girlfriend who is hard to please when it comes to authentic Asian food (this was authentic according to my girlfriend who has been to Thailand,) was impressed, and she's an LA born Asian food California snob."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood!! I've traveled to Thailand and the name of this business couldn't be more accurate!  The food is authentic and embraces the Thai flavors! Their heat range goes from 1-5.  I chose 3 and it was pretty spicy! However, if you choose level 1, you will still get flavor without the heat. 

For my 1st visit, I ordered drunken noodles and curry chicken for my 1st visit. The drunken noodles were on par and the curry was fantastic! 

For my 2nd visit, I ordered Pad Woon Sen and Fried rice. The Pad Woon Sen was fantastic! The noodles were cooked to perfection! It was so fresh and I mention this because some Thai places overcook the noodles and they end up sticking together. This place is great!! They are working on their liquor license so no booze yet."}
{"text":"They've only been open a week, but there is much to like here. The owners are friendly and helpful, the food is very good and prices are reasonable. My daughter, who spent 2 months working in Thailand, liked everything we tried and was especially fond of the tom kha gai soup which she said was just like she enjoyed in southern Thailand (Less spicy and more sour than I'm used to but really delicious. She says the northern version is more like what is typical in local Thai places). Nothing was very spicy, but if you like it hot, I'm sure you can ask for more heat.
We will be back for sure to try some new things!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've had in Phoenix. Loving how convenient it is located. The Curry and Pai Thai was the best."}
{"text":"Found this place by our Flooring Store . They had just opened. Food is amazing, place is clean and owners are friendly. 
We wish them luck and will be there often."}
{"text":"We got the egg rolls, tom yum soup, and lemon grass garlic chicken stir fry and everything was amazing.  The egg rolls are homemade and may be the best I've ever had.  You also get 4 large ones for $7.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had chicken panang curry. Comes with pad Thai noodles and spring roll. It was awesome and authentic Thai food! Nice decor although we had take out. The bar seating will get me back there too, especially if I'm doing lunch in my own. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was craving some Thai food and stumbled upon this while looking for new places to try. Had the chicken pad Thai along with a Thai iced tea.  Both were excellent. Would definitely come back and try some of their other options."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Thai food I have had in Arizona! The staff is very sweet, the restaurant is clean and bright and the food is fantastic. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is really yummy, clean place, cute decor, friendly service BUT they don't staff enough so service is very slow. Had dinner here tonight, never got water refilled or checked on after getting food. My food came out way before my dates. Date ordered fried rice and got a bowl of steamed white rice and a bowl of stir fried veggies (mostly onions). It was delicious but not what we expected. This was our second visit and both times the food was pretty salty which we like but it might be too much for some people."}
{"text":"Really delicious food.  Was looking for Thai and our usual place was closed for the day, so I gave Authentic Thai Kitchen a try.  So glad I did.  The penang curry was delicious!  Perfect blend of spice and flavors.  We did takeaway, but the inside looked very nice...will definitely do a sit-down next time."}
{"text":"From the outside, we didn't think much of it. But we saw reviews and had to try it! 

The atmosphere was awesome! It was a mix of Thai culture with a modern touch. And all the staff members were friendly and attentive. Their bathrooms were very clean with great updated decoration. 

I got the wonton shrimp soup, and it was delicious! It was a light, but filling soup. My boyfriend got the lemon grass garlic rice entree, and it was so flavorful. Lastly, we both got Thai teas no boba. The glasses they came in were adorable,  and they tasted really good. 

Would definitely recommend this place for a chill but authentic Thai cuisine meal."}
{"text":"Contemporary decor. Service was pleasant but a little slow. Food was a little bland but came in large portions, can season to taste. Dumplings were favorite. Condiments on table were sticky, bathroom out of paper towels, music got irritating after awhile. Not the best Thai in town imo."}
{"text":"It's good to finally have a Thai restaurant in this area of central Phoenix. It is a cozy little establishment occupying the space that used to be Cor Tapas and Wine, bigger inside than it looks from the outside, with comfortable seating and Asian contemporary decor. Service is fast and friendly and the menu consists of standard Thai restaurant favorites. The food is flavorful, the portions are ample and prices are typical of most Thai restaurants in the Valley. Parking spaces for the restaurant are limited, but street parking is available down Campbell just a very short distance from the restaurant (look for the sign that indicates the end of the no-parking area); and as of this writing, management is trying to arrange for additional parking in the parking area very close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!   Best Thai in Phoenix, hands down.  The orange chicken is delicate and prepared to perfection.  The Panang tofu melts wonderfully and the flavors explode.  A party in my mouth and all of Bangkok is invited..."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to check out this place as I received an email from Yelp notifying me of this new cool restaurant in the neighborhood. The experience tonight was more than disappointing! I simply wasted my time sitting there for nearly 20 minutes just to get the order taken. I am perplexed how poorly mismanaged this restaurant is during its first opening months. My biggest complaint is about tonight's customer service. There was only one server who was running around like a wild horse. You cannot order alcohol as they don't have a liquor license yet. I was hoping that cold beer would make things better as I wait for my server to even acknowledge my existence! 
The place was busy. But one server at 6pm- come on! Poor service! She was overwhelmed herself without making things right with the customers. Nobody knew what was going on and kept looking at each other, wondering if there was any restaurant staff. One couple simply left as they waited to be greeted. And to add to my misery- the place was so hot. I noticed they kept it at 78F degrees inside. 
The food was mediocre. I wish this restaurant good luck."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! 
Green curry and pad thai very clean and authentic taste!!!
Very nice friendly atmosphere!!!
Great service!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great addition to our neighborhood. Came in for dinner and ordered yellow curry with chicken. My sister and I shared and it was more than enough for the both of us. It came with a huge bowl of rice. It was delicious, and definitely spicy for a 2 out of 5 spice level. The prices are also competitive. 

The restaurant itself is modern and nice. Our server was great. You could still kind of tell that they just opened. They have some awesome specials on lunch. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai foood
Had the drunken noodles w calamari 
And yum salad 
Thai tea
Dumplings 
Great
Need more waiters 
Be patient it's worth it"}
{"text":"I don't know if the food is authentic or not but I do know it was good...very good.  I arrived shortly before lunch and had a terrible time finding a parking place.  This should tell you something about the food straight away.  The place was filled but there was still a table or two and our waitress was literally running between tables.  Although it too a while for our food to come, it was well worth the short wait.  Will go back....maybe next week."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!!  Absolutely delicious and scrumptious!!  The pad se ew is tasty. The fried rice is yummy and the Thai kitchen is excellent!  Service is friendly and food you can tell is made fresh. This is our new favorite Thai restaurant. Yay!!  And then to seal the deal, the mango and sticky rice will put you over the top."}
{"text":"I had some of the best yellow curry that I have ever had. The combination of the chicken with potatoes, onions and celery was perfect. Parking lot is rather small but the modern vibe inside is so wonderful. This will become a staple for me!"}
{"text":"We were craving Thai food and decided to check out this new addition to the central Phoenix area.  Nice decor, friendly staff and tasty food. 
We shared an order of the steamed dumplings and really enjoyed them - flavorful and hearty.  I ordered the panang curry with pork lunch special that included rice and an egg roll - large portion and tasty food.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Actually called \"Authentic Thai Kitchen\". This place is very clean, and the staff is very kind. Price per dish is about a $1-$2 premium above other thai restuants in the area, but the food is good. We ordered the penang curry, and the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"This was the best Thai food we have tried so far in Phoenix. The restaurant is very cute and cozy and the service was great. We both had the lunch special- one yellow curry and the other red. I chose tofu as my protein and was very impressed with the flavor. The egg rolls were fantastic. BUT, beware of the spice level of the curry. You can choose levels 1-5 and the server gave a suggestion to keep it pretty low. Being a spice-fanatic I figured a 3 would too weak, but it was perfect. As for my friend who doesn't love spice as much, she chose a 1 and said it was still spicy but delicious."}
{"text":"Nice Surprise 

Authentic Thai Kitchen opened in early January, and I have been driving by daily, so I thought it's about time I try this place. I am so glad I did, because, Thai Kitchen, is serving up some really food food. 

The menu at Thai Kitchen is smaller than other Thai restaurants however, it was more then adequate. The Tom Kha soup was very flavorful with just enough large shrimp. The Pad Thai with shrimp was some of the best Pad Thai I've had in a while. My entree was loaded with large shrimp. 

The portions at Thai Kitchen are large. I was only able to eat half of my entee and enjoyed the rest for lunch the next day. The prices are  average. The servers were efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable.  

If you enjoy Thai cuisine and are in the area, give Thai Kitchen a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Glad I found this cute little Thai restaurant in my neighborhood! Great food....a little spicy, so if you're not into a little kick, you may not like. Other than that it's really good. So if you're in the mood for Tahi flavors, stop by!"}
{"text":"I love having a restaurant I can walk to! I tried this place for the first time on Friday. I'll start by saying the food is delicious. Five stars for the food. Keep up the good work! I do have a few comments/suggestions for the owners. Until you get a full liquor license, consider a BYOB option. The neighborhood people would be so happy to have this option. I was really looking forward to a glass of wine with my food and was disappointed to find there is no alcohol. Second, the restaurant closes at 9pm on a Friday night which alone is strange. We almost went somewhere else because we weren't able to get there until 8:15. I noticed that the open sign was turned off and the door closed at 8:30. We felt rushed. Please consider staying open to 10pm on the weekend. Especially once you get a liquor license. Finally, pay attention to the details. The lights are way too bright. Lighting is HUGE when it comes to setting the mood. This really nice restaurant now feels like a cafeteria. I went a few times when it was the tapas restaurant. Simply lowering the lights would make a huge difference. Lastly, the bar had dirty dishes piled up, boxes of supplies and all sorts of other items in full view. Hide these items. It really takes away from the setting. Just a few suggestions from someone who eats out a lot. I really want this restaurant to be successful. The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"People working here are nice and I love how clean and nicely decorated the interior is, but my curry kind of sucked. I feel bad saying that too because everything else about this place was great! I called in my order on Saturday for lunch, and when I got there there were no customers. Also idk where I would've parked had there been customers because that is a tiny oddly set up parking lot. But I liked the art painted on the side of the building!
My curry was ready to be picked up promptly! Wasn't super expensive for a huge portion either. I was excited when I saw how much curry I got haha. Was a bit of a let down when I ate it though. I did get mild, but I get mild everywhere and it usually still has flavor. This red curry was not very flavorful, pretty bland. Also it was basically just tofu and bamboo shoots, just a couple small slices of carrots. Like I've had curry from a lot of different places and there's almost always at least a couple different vegetables in there, bit just bamboo chutes. I might have just gotten a bad batch or something though? If I return I'll get something else!"}
{"text":"fast casual style restaurant but definitely fine dining quality food. Was amazed by this hidden gem. If you love Thai food. This is the place to go. The Tom Kha is the best I ever had, all the seafood in it are fresh n delicious. Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Absolutely amazing. The staff was so wonderful and attentive, they made you feel like family. Now for the food. OH. MY. GAWD. So flavorful everything is perfect. The foods served on these beautiful hand painted golden plates, the ambiance of the location is gorgeous. I can't wait to come back. So excited this restaurant is within walking distance of my complex. If you haven't been you need to go. The Tom Ka is to die for! Again the owners and staff made the night,. even if the food wasn't amazing I would come back just to see them. I can definitely say I'll be a regular here and I'm sending all my friends!"}
{"text":"Cute space, good Thai food.   Spice levels are higher than we expected but we were warned and a little spicy is always good!   Portions were good.   We tried pepper garlic with chicken and spicy bamboo with beef.   No alcohol sold (as of April 10, 2018)  but liquor license is pending.   Parking is a little tight.   Enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and both times the flavor was amazing and the prices were great. The first time I went here I left my credit card at the restaurant and the staff were very accommodating and safe about giving it back."}
{"text":"This would be a five star review if it weren't for the inadequate parking I found on a Thursday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The facility itself is clean, with a  polished concrete floor and one polished concrete table. 
The menus are printed on photostatic paper with a color printer. We were served water in tall pilsner glasses. The food was presented in deep white bowls on a very large platter. It was very attractive. 
I had Pao Pad with Chicken. It was served promptly, The taste is complex and rich. It is not hot the way they serve it, but I must emphasise it is very very flavorful. 
When you go I highly recommend your get choice B. It's about a dollar more, but you get soup and some Pad Thai with you lunch. You can take what you don't eat home with you. How long it will last in your refrigerator, will only be a long time if you forget. You won't. It's so good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai food in a minimalist atmosphere then this is your place. Especially if you have 2 hours of time so you came accommodate for the very slow service. In fact, if not for the slow service, this would easily be a 5 Star and require me to adjust other reviews accordingly. It is important to remember Do Not Go here if you are pressed for time. My friend had the Pad Thai for the first time and I fear this restaurant may have sat her expectations a little high for other Thai restaurants. My wife had the Fried Rice but would suggest adding more heat/spice when ordering. The Basil dish was excellent. I hope you have time to enjoy...with patience.@"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and had the best experience! The accommodated all of our requests and the food was ready to go in a jiff! The vegetable springs roll, I must say, are the best I've ever had! You MUST try them! Also had the Tom yum with vegetables, a little salty for my taste but, I would give it another go! My boyfriend and friend said their food was also so good! They had curry and noodles beef! Large portions, great food, and so excited to have an awesome new spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was so excited this place opened up nearby and finally got to try it out. The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing. I will definitely be a regular. We had the shrimp pad thai and the chicken chow mein. I loved that they gave an option on spice level. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it was excellent! Highly recommend the Thai fried wontons and the garlic pepper chicken. The plates they served the food on were so beautiful. They even gave fresh rice in a little container to each of us for our to go orders. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This has become almost a weekly stop for my boyfriend and I. Whenever we're craving Thai but not feeling like driving all the way to Glendale, we come here. Their food is consistantly tasty. Their take out is prepared quickly, though you're not always guarenteed that they will be open for their listed hours or will answer the phone.

Thats the reason for the -1 star. But they're still just starting out and I dont think they were prepared for how popular they would become! I dont even think their tiny parking lot to hold all the cars it would take to fill up the dinning area, so beware parking can be a bit difficult. And the restaurant itself is very easy to miss.

For the food: I'm a massive fan of their chicken egg rolls, even when they're over cooked they're delicious! My go to entree is their drunken noodles, I love baby corn and mushrooms so theirs definitely doesn't disappoint. And they add just the right amount of heat on a level 3, which is very rare. My boyfriend enjoys their curry but found that even a level 5 on their pad thai was more sweet than spicy. 

In all I really like the place, and hope that people forget about it unless they live in the area so that they don't run out of food or have to close early anymore. And so I can have all the egg rolls."}
{"text":"We had a good experience and liked the food the first time. We came back and brought a friend. It took over an hour for our food to come out, and the it came in stages. The quality was fair, not at all consistent with our previous visit in taste or level of spiceness. The brown rice finally appeared 1 1/2 hours later. Everything else was finished by then. They never apologized or explained the delay, and the place was empty when we were there. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Fast service & just the most beautiful industrial, Thai, chic interior. We had the laap (chicken mint salad), papaya salad which came with large shrimp (#3 spicy which was hoooottt!),  pad see eww which was a little thick & beef was a little tough. The food was crisp, spicy, sour, and savory just as it should be. Will be returning to try the mango & stick rice dessert."}
{"text":"Good food, not the best service. If you want great Thai food, go here. If you want to be treated like royalty, don't. Also they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Used to be COR, so is very attractive inside.  No wine, beer or happy hour. Unsure about BYOB. A bit pricey though food is good."}
{"text":"The name says it all: Authentic Thai Kitchen is truly some of the most authentic Thai cuisine you can get here in the valley.  Every order that we ate was absolutely sensational!  We had the chicken satay, beef panang and chicken pad thai.  Each dish was super flavorful, came in beautiful thai dishware, and the entrees were an amazing size. We had enough leftovers for us to each take a full lunch to work the next day, and man oh man, did we enjoy it!

The only star dock is because they need more waitstaff.  The woman who waited on us was working her tail off! She was doing it all - filling beverages, running food, taking in-person and phone orders....If she got some help then I think this has the potential to be a 5-star place for sure. :)

If you like true, authentic, flavorful Thai food, then Authentic Thai Kitchen is definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"I should have gotten up and walked out. Food was mediocre and the service was astoundingly poor. Canned mushrooms in the Tom Kha? Seriously?  Authentic? Ummm no.  Unless the unauthentic Chinese have recently invaded Thailand.  Waitress had responsibility over entire restaurant, which overwhelmed her, so that is on owner. Many menu items not available, including satay. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Had the Panang Curry (chicken) and a Thai tea.    The curry was VERY good, IMO.    Heavier on the peanut taste than some, which I like.   Was advertised as 'creamy', and it was!   Potatoes were slightly under cooked, but I'm not that big of a fan of potatoes in my curry anyway (next time I'll ask them to leave the spuds out).   Ordered a 3 because I had not been here before.   I like it hot, and it was plenty spicy, though I might go 4 next time.  The serving was large and yummy!   

Thai tea was just as it should be, and a perfect chaser to the spicy curry.  

Service was fast and friendly.  

I'll return."}
{"text":"Tried take out at this place yesterday and it was
BOMBBBBB!!! Had the red curry with coconut milk, brown rice and a side of pad Thai and also an order of the green curry with white rice and a side of pad Thai. They asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale of
1-5, with 5 being super spicy. The 4 that I picked did not disappoint! Cleared my allergies right up :) The lunch portions were generous and fairly priced. Can't wait to try more things on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Don't wait to be seated, just grab a table, booth or bar stool. At least at lunch this is the case. We stood for more than a few embarrassing minutes until the waitress said \"oh, sit anywhere.\" This might not be the case at dinner, however.

A heads up: the lunch menu special no longer has pad Thai and soup with it. See my photo of the menu,--only rice, egg roll and your choice of entree. I asked to substitute the rice for noodles but the response was \"we don't have that anymore.\" Ok, so maybe some communication issues with how I asked that.

I ordered the chicken chow mein looking for a healthy dose of egg noodles. The hubby ordered from the lunch menu so I had a taste of the egg roll, which was very tasty.

If you are in need of protein, the chicken chow mein will satisfy. My preference would have been for more of their yummy egg noodles and far fewer pieces of the chicken.  HUGE portions. I took a doggy bag home of a heap of chicken. Fido will love this, except I don't have a dog, so this will be lunch/dinner for at least another day or two, add noodles and stir fry!

I saw only one waitress (perhaps a daughter of the cook?) and the cook, who brought the food to our table. She was sprinting around to keep up with the growing lunch crowd. 

The parking situation is tight with very few spots."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Thai food fan but tried this place because a friend recommended it. I've gone there about four times in the past two weeks. The food is great. I've had the shrimp egg rolls, regular egg rolls, pepper chicken, shrimp fried rice, and cashew chicken. All the dishes I've had were great. Big portions too. Was able to have leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"First time eating Authentic Thai Kitchen and this place is amazing! We placed an order over the phone and it was ready in 15min. The woman I spoke to was extremely nice and double checked everything to ensure it was all correct. 

We ordered the panang curry with vegetables, pad woonsen with beef, Tom yum soup, and vegetable spring rolls. Every single thing was delicious and very flavorful. The spring rolls were literally the BEST spring rolls I've ever had. 

I definitely recommend giving this spot a try if you're a lover of Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Finally a Thai place super close to my work!  Charming and hip storefront but really tiny parking lot.  Parking might be a problem once this place starts taking off!

Walked in and it's clean, beautifully modern with a lot of Thai touches.  A lot of gray but the warmth of the wood touches balance out the atmosphere.  The music playing reminded us of spa music, a little different but I was digging it because I was feeling relaxed and ready to eat!

Ordered the broccoli stir fry with tofu.  Garlicky and the tofu was cooked perfectly!  Nice light refreshing dish.  

Pad-se-ew was delicious!  Beef was the protein, it was cooked perfectly and not chewy.  Noodles nice and chewy, sauce was great!  

Rice perfectly sticky!

I grabbed a to-go menu as I'll probably be getting more take out from here.  I can't wait to try their pad Thai, Panang, and other lunch specials.

To drink we had the Thai tea, oh boy, I couldn't get enough!  Love the bright orange color when the cream is mixed in.   Don't miss out on this sweet creamy drink, if you never had it, it's quite a treat for your tastebuds!  

The service was excellent and very gracious!  Great local addition to Cen-Pho!"}
{"text":"I don't Yelp! 
I really don't because I think people get petty on here, and it's usually out of ignorance or a sense of entitlement, so I have to admit I didn't ever have a desire to participate, positive or negative. 

However, this place definitely deserves a great review! I will simply say the papaya salad, and won tons were brilliant! And it's a place where you can tell they put there heart into it. 
So, here I am Yelping to say this place is excellent! 
I also need to say, I do not know or have any affiliation with this place.
This is a genuine unbiased review."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews we decided to try this quaint little restaurant at lunchtime. We arrived before noon and there were already a number of people already eating and only a few tables open. We waited to be seated. This lone waitress was helping other customers but did not acknowledge us for a number of minutes. When she did speak to us she motioned that we could sit anywhere we wanted.

The lunch special only comes with rice, no longer noodles. The rice is very good, so don't feel you have to order noodles. I enjoyed the flavor of my kung pao chicken, I just wish I had ordered it hotter.

If you are lucky, you will get a parking space. However, you'd better get there early or all the spaces will be taken as there are only a few spaces to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the vegetable pad thai and it was super good! My friend had the panang, and that's definitely what I'll get next time, it was so good. The location was easy to find, plenty of parking and the service was fine. The building itself is decorated nicely and is very clean. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Where to even start. The parking lot consists of 6 parking spots and two tandem if you dare risk it. There is one server for the entire restaurant, which was hustling her booty off, but we couldn't get her attention to save our lives. The restaurant was unbearably freezing, like to the point my nose was running. We waited over 45 mins, probably close to an hour for our food with maybe 12 people in the whole place. When our entrees finally arrived. I decided the tom yum soup starter wasn't necessary since we had our entrees. The server seemed confused since the cooks just \"started making it\" wtf? The food was ok. Nothing to rave about and did not warrant the 45 min plus wait. They have zero alcohol. Nothing not even beer or wine to numb the pain of the long wait, lack of service and runny bland curry. I give them 6 months. I gave 2 stars because the server was nice even though you had to wave her down to get anything. Such a shame. I'll go back to thai lotus or wild thaiger. Not a fan. Nothing redeeming about this place."}
{"text":"Having driven past this cute little box-shaped building many times, I hoped for good food, given the reviews, but hardly expected the lovely, soft spa-like ambiance offered at ATK.  Gracious service and WOW food - larb was excellent, papaya salad as well - we had two entrees, and my daughter persuaded us to try the homemade coconut ice cream - don't pass on this!

No liquor licence or BYOB, BTW."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The wontons were incredibly fresh and tasty, as were the other dishes we ordered; yellow curry, and papaya salad. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good find on yelp.  Nice little place - almost missed it.  Ordered Pad see ew and Penang beef - my favorites.  Just good food!"}
{"text":"Oh my god dayyyum! So good soooo good! I'm thai and I have been looking for a restaurant and this is it! So good we got the ribs red curry green curry and lad nah. All so so good especially the ribs. Everything was amazing the plates and all the silverware as well as the interior were beautiful. Service was very friendly and nice. 

Also they don't skimp at all. Well worth the money.

Will most definitely be back, like maybe tomorrow hehe ;D (not joking)"}
