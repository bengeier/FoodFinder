{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could. Had been meaning to try the original Buca for a couple years. Finally went on a Friday, sat in the back area, surprisingly not very full. 

Our server was semi-helpful with the menu, maybe I didn't ask the right questions. \"Everything is good\" doesn't help much. The sommelier was helpful and narrowed our wine choices down and we were happy with the med-bodied red blend we chose

Cocktails to start were decent but not memorable. Charcuterie plate was overpriced for what was served. Flavor was good with the meats but not stand out, portions super skimpy. Next time I would skip charcuterie and try something else like the pig ears 

Pastas were excellent. Bucatini and the spaghetti. Cooked perfectly, wonderful flavours. Possibly better because I got to try both and enjoyed the contrast. 

The tiramisu dessert wasn't my preference. I like more traditional tiramisu. 

Had to ask for water refill twice (and waited to see if one of many people who came by/bussed/refilled wine/checked on how things were going would notice, they never did). The server finally noticed on his own to refill as we were settling up the bill. A simple but important detail like this in a finer dining establishment is very disappointing. 

The space is gorgeous and the pastas as good as people have raved about. I'd return and hope for a better server."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Sharing plates is the way to go, but don't fill up on dinner, since the tiramisu is unbelievable."}
{"text":"One if not the best restaurant in Toronto. Everything they do is done with style. The service and food is authentic, crafted and exceptionally well executed. The bigoli pasta is my favourite. However the pizzas are top notch also. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Buca came highly recommended for myself and family. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed but I did not leave the restaraunt with my jaw hanging on the floor. I cannot express how small the portions are, and that is not limited to the appetizers or main courses, but everything. I recommend the various pizzas in order to get your money's-worth, everything else can be devoured in 2-3 bites. The interior of the building is unique and interesting but it sadly does not compensate for the lack of substance on your plate. Save your money and head somewhere else if you're hungry because you won't leave Buca with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Dinner at Buca has been quite possibly the best meal I've had in years. 

My family and I had out last meal at Buca during our visit to Toronto and I couldn't have had it any other way. 6 different dishes and not a single disappointment. I recommend the tomato ravioli, smaller portion then I would have liked, but definitely worth it. The pizza, gnocchi, veal, fish, and scallops were spectacular. Awesome goodbye dinner."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4/5

Food: Overall, all the dishes were great. Only slightly disappointed because they took their bone marrow off the menu.
Beef Tartare (forget the actual name on the menu Tartara something) - My favourite dish out of the four. The meat wasn't chewy and went great with the seasoned flat bread. If raw meat is your thing, definitely a must try!
Bigoli (Duck egg pasta) - Pasta was made al dente, which most people probably love. I actually prefer it a little softer. It's a very savoury dish. It just got a bit salty at the end because we might have not mixed it well enough. I would definitely order this again.
Scarpinocc (Lobster-filled tomato leaf pasta) - Al dente pasta filled with plenty of lobster! They definitely didn't skimp out! Great dish! 
Soppressata (calabrese spiced sausage pizza) - Also very good, and had a little kick of spiciness to it, which I loved. Overall, it didn't stand out as much as the other dishes. If I go back, I would one of the many other pizzas they had.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant is hidden inside an alley way, next to Valdez. I only knew where it was because I wanted to go to bar buca once, but I found this place instead. I actually had to go into another restaurant to ask for directions to Buca. Only the entrance was above ground, but it was worth the search though!
We were seated inside their wine cave. It was a little dim for our liking but it was a very romantic atmosphere. There were tables by the bar and that area is better lit with natural light from outside. 

Service:
Very patient and informative waitress because we had a lot of questions about the menu. The only thing is, at the end, it was hard to flag her down for the bill. I don't know if it is because we sat there for too long chatting and she just thought we wanted some privacy. 

The food was relatively pricey, but I would say it's worth it to go try a few dishes with some friends."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday. We were both on the more adventurous side so the menu was simply dazzling. Expect smaller portions but very flavourful and well executed dishes. Also, expect to spend. We came here for a special occasion. You get what you pay for. Foodies rejoice."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming. The high scores on Yelp actually makes me feel sorry for people who probably haven`t really tasted good food before. The pasta was not salted,  and tasted like.. nothing actually. The fish (pickerel) had absolutely no seasoning-just a white fish with nothing else on the plate. I don`t mind paying for good food, but this was ridiculous.
My thought always is, if my Jamaican mother can cook a substantially better Italian meal than a so-called `Italian restaurant`` can serve, then you don`t deserve to be charging these ridiculous prices with false bravado."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best italian places in town and one of the better I have ever been to. They really get it!"}
{"text":"The food here is first-class, innovative, beautifully prepared and delicious. I love Italian food and especially pasta, and my pasta dish, Scialetteli pasta with asparagus pesto, Gulf shrimp and mullet/herring caviar, was the BEST I have ever had. Other items, such as bread knots and a unique deconstructed version of eggplant parmesan -- by analogy, think of the Ratatouille version of ratatouille -- were almost as good. For desert, we shared the Zuccotti - $26 is a lot for a desert, but in this case well worth it for the Florentine classic (and you save the flight ticket to Florence). My only complaint was the music -- some soulless best-of-classical hit CD which kept playing over and over again (we heard Eine Kleine Nachtmusik three times). But that's a minor complaint -- If you love food and are willing to pay, go for it"}
{"text":"A really great rustic, Italian restaurant!  Ambience is beautiful and the crowd is best on a Friday night.

I've been here 3 times and I've never been disappointed.  

The pizza is great.  I've had the sausage pizza and the margherita - both were delicious!  You must try the 3 selections of salumi.  They come with accompanying condiments that are just perfectly paired.  If they have the zucchini flowers with burrata cheese...you must try! 

Two other people in my party had the black ink pasta dish and the duck pasta.  Both of them said they were great.  I had the veal carpaccio.  It was garnished with olive oil, capers, pine nuts and cheese.  It was amazing.

My only hang up is that the wait staff could be a little faster with taking and placing the order.  But I do like that they speak Italian.  Many of them are right from Italy.  

Buca is great.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was not blown away as I expected to be by their food. I had one of their pizzas which was average. I felt that the waiter was judging my boyfriend and I because we did not order much and treated us like we were inexperienced with high-end restaurants. Did not like this. The dessert was amazing. Noiciolla gelato and tiramisu are some of the best ive tried, overall ok."}
{"text":"Took my father out for lunch today and risked a new place--had heard good things about Buca. 

We mixed some starter salad plates for lunch and it was just right. The heirloom tomato salad was a great choice. Beautiful, ripe, sweet tomatoes and the dressing was very delicate. The lamb skewers were cooked just right. Nice flavor. Bread knots and stuffed olives to round it out. Stuffed olives were just, mmmm, perhaps the breading was a little dense or overly crisp? 

Chianti by the glass was very good. Beautiful and smooth. Nothing sharp in the taste.

Space is great. Dark and comfortable. Admittedly, I felt a bit underdressed in jeans and a T (hey, it was Friday) but our server didn't flinch. 

The crowd looked a little funereal with all the black, but altogether it was very lovely.

Would feel very confident bringing a client there."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to like this place, being how hip and trendy it is, but I do have to say that I was won over by the food and the service was impeccable...

As disturbing as it sounds, try the pigs ears, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I went to Buca for the first time recently, and was greeted warmly (without reservation) and given a table straight away. I appreciated the prompt service. For appetizers, I shared the nodinis. They were divine! They came perfectly crusty and hot on the outside and warm and doughy on the inside, drizzled in a nice olive oil with garlic and sea salt on top. I think everyone would enjoy these. 

My main was the pomodoro e tartufo pizza, which is essentially a pizza with tomato sauce, truffled burrata, and fresh shaved black summer truffles. For $29, it was very steep as far as pizza goes, but I love truffle and burrata so I thought it'd be worth it. The pizza was very good, however I didn't realize that the burrata would be a topping after the pizza was cooked, so it got cold quickly. The truffle taste was very light and not overpowering at all, and the crust was good. I would probably order a different one next time, but it was good. I think Libretto is the best pizza in the city so I came into Buca ready to compare and there wasn't much of a contest when considering the whole pizza. The wine and cheese lists were extensive, and if you are a fan of charcuterie you will love Buca. 

For dessert, I split the Zuccotto. At $26, it's a splurge, but it was so worth it. The presentation was excellent- the dome was placed on our table, and the waiter explained what it was made up of. Then chocolate glaze was poured around it. It had a cookie base and a light, fluffy chocolate hazelnut mousse inside the chocolate/vanilla striped exterior dome. It is clear that a lot of care went into it's preparation. You can never go wrong with anything chocolate/hazelnut (at least for me that's true!) and it did not disappoint.

Buca has great ambience, great service, and great food. It's take on Italian is innovative and sure to please. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars because of my very expensive main course that was lacking compared to other 'gourmet' pizzas, but the appetizer and dessert were perfection."}
{"text":"Buca is an absolute joke! Servers are pretentious and rude.  Food is overpriced and nothing special. No one ever makes you feel welcomed in a genuine type way. HTere are so many other Italian restaurants in the city with far better food, prices and friendlier staff. The only thing you have going for you is the space and decor, which is impressive.

Gusto 101 puts you all to shame."}
{"text":"This place is dark with out of date decor. They claim to make their pasta daily but I feel it's overrated, been frozen as I can taste the difference. The duck pasta was a joke - thick pasta noodle easy to break and sauce is too salty (can't taste or see any duck meat).

Service was slow and one of their waiter gave me attitude when I decided not to order liquor. I would spend the money at Giancarlo Trattoria at little Italy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Buca last week for dinner and here's my review:

Food: Amazing. Great food, good portions!
Service: Friendly! Very rare on King West!!!!! I live in the area and had terrible experiences at other King W restaurants. Our waiter at Buca was so approachable, very friendly, and actually answered questions we had about the menu! We were very impressed.
Ambience: Buca has a beautiful patio and inside is just as nice.

Great ambience, great service and delicious food! We are definitely going back again :)"}
{"text":"Buca is the best italian in the city. The dishes are interesting, fresh, satisfying and use a wide variety of ingredients typically not seen in Toronto. The service is incredibly professional. Lately it hash;t been as good. I have noticed a lot of new faces and they must be hiring/training for the opening of the Four Seasons locations and Buca Bar which opened recently. 

They are always busy for dinner, every night of the week from open to close. i find that some dishes can be inconsistent which must be a reflection of how crazy the kitchen must be. The pizzas sometimes don't have the same amount of toppings, eggplant parmesan is sometimes  a little  soggy, bigoli pasta is cold, etc. The best pizzas are the fungi and tartufo nero. 

I recently had lunch there for the first time and strongly recommend it. It is a lot less busy and the food came out hot and pizzas were topped generously. When paying 30$ for a pizza you want it to be hot and filling. The dough for both pasta and pizza are made fresh everyday, as are the garlic knots. They recently started making their own burrata which I salute, though the flavour doesn't compare to fresh-off-the-boat Puglia burrata. 

I recommend going with at least 2 or 3 other people and sharing as much as you can. Try some charcuterie, a pizza or two, pasta and some appetizers. Save room for the tiramisu because it is one of the best out there. The wine list is on the pricey side so be prepared for that They have sommelier who is helpful and they are more that willing to let you try some of the wine before committed to a bottle."}
{"text":"I went here last night, and I loved it!

First, the atmosphere is really good - I'm a sucker for bricks though so I generally like any restaurant that has brick walls.

My friend and I started with the trio of cheese (I think it was around $18 for 3).  We asked the waiter's advice as to which cheeses to choose and his reco was excellent.  Each cheese comes with its own condiment so we had a baby mozzarella with a rhubarb compote, a paresan with strawberry and another cheese which I can't remember with marmelade - fantastic!

For my main, I had the gnocchi which was really good and my friend had some kind of pasta with lemon and ricotta (she really liked it but it wasn't my thing).  Both were around $20

We wanted a little something extra so we split a trio of sorbet - bergamot, rhubarb and mango - the rhubarb was my favourite

All in all, a great night.  The service was excellent, the room was really nice and the food was awesome (and reasonably priced).  My only complaint was that our cocktails were really small and didn't appear to have much alcohol in them.  I'd stick to wine if I went again."}
{"text":"Buca has renewed my love for Italian food. 

The place has a rustic feel to it with exposed brick, high ceilings and meat lockers.

The menu changes occasionally and the current ones are date stampped
My friend and I shared the lamb brain app (2 pieces fried in a thick batter for $7), porchetta pizza ($19) and black squid ink pasta with a duck yolk ($24). 

The lamb brain was good. I don't have it often at all so it was different so it was nice to try it in a different form (I previously had it in ravioli). 

The porchetta pizza was delicious with wide strips of porchetta all over (amazing) with fried rosemary. The crust was crisp and didn't end up being soggy at all in the centre of the pizza. It comes with large sewing scissors for you to cut in strips. I like things a bit spicy so they provided some homemade chili sauce (they don't have chili flakes). Delicious. 

The black squid in pasta was really savoury which was perfect for sharing, otherwise  I think it would be too much for one person. The waiter mixed it at the table (to incorporate the duck yolk) and served us both. 

Looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Buca has a wonderful atmosphere. Bare brick walls and a corridor displaying their meats. Just overall a very pretty restaurant to be in. Their cured meats were excellent but other than that, everything else was not very memorable. We ordered the Patate Pizza which was boring after the first bite and also got the Bigoli pasta which was good, but not great. The servers did their jobs but really weren't friendly at all. Maybe it was an off day for them but I was definitely disappointed in my experience there."}
{"text":"What a cool little place.  I went here with my cousin the other day and really enjoyed the overall experience.

We shared the plate of lamb brains which was my first attempt ever at eating brains and it was... good but def shouldn't look at the food while eating it cause it did look like brains.

I had the squid ink pasta and it was sooooooo good.  My only little issue with it was that it was a tad bit on the salty side but otherwise it was good and different.

Heads up before going to Buca is that its not your average Italian place.  There's a twist on each entree but that's a GREAT thing.  It definitely keeps the place appealing.  

Second - make reservations before you go.  We didn't and I wasn't too keen on being placed at a squishy bar."}
{"text":"Outstanding!

Went to Buca this summer on a warm wednesday evening and it was just outstanding! Arrived slightly late to our 6:30pm reservation but were seated promptly nonetheless. The room hummed with 30 somethings sipping wines, and enjoying chef Gentile's Nose-to-Tail southern Italian food. We asked for the sommelier and then came an excellent sommelier with a thick Italian accent, he suggested a slightly light-bodied red which was delicious and was proof of what an accomplished sommelier he was. To start, we had an exceptional Parmigiana di Melanzane (Eggplant Parmigiana) and Nodini (Garlic Bread Knots). The Eggplant was crisp eggplant with vibrant preserved tomato, unbelievably fresh buffalo ricotta, and unctuous buratta. The nodini were toasty garlic and ricotta bread knots doused with olive oil and served piping hot. Next came Pomodoro E Tartufo Pizze, absolutely no words for this! Crisp roman Pizze with preserved tomato, truffle-flecked buratta, and fresh scorzone truffles shaved on top, marvellous. Our pastas arrived, Spaghetti Al Nero di Maiale, and Ziti. The spaghetti was hand-crafted pasta made from pig's blood with n'duja, soffrito, wild ramps topped with buratta, delicious. Ziti, was one of the only caveats of the evening, tough pasta with bland accesories. For a sweet ending, we enjoyed their Tiramisú, quite an inventive way to present and make a Tiramisú and was quite good. Finished with a lovely cappuccino served with a biscotti, and an ameretti cookie to cap off the night. Just one of my best meals of the year. Ciao Bella!"}
{"text":"Amaaazing surrounding and service! Great food. Really relaxing. My parents loved it! Had the lamb brain, very interesting and decent dish. Not so pricey as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great wait staff. Enjoyed the dining experience with the bf. My bf and I got the Bigoli. It was to die for! I'll definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit hard to find its entrance - have to walk deep into an alley to the door, don't know how first timer can easily figure it out especially at night.

Pros: Appetizer is above average. Fresh made pasta.

Cons: service slow and snobby (they seem to only care about 'important' tables who order lots of wine). Pizza is disappointing - if you are fan of thick fat crust, PIzza hut is probably a better choice for half the cost. With a menu that pricy ( typical 2 ppl dinner with wine cost $200)it lost the soul of true Italian cuisine that everyone can join the table."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with our experience here last night. Starting with not enough light to read the menus to the very minute portions. The main course was the size of an appetizer at most other restaurants.  The price is no indication of the quantity. When ready to leave it took approximately 45 minutes because of the lack of credit card machines to losing one of our coats. The coat check room which we insisted on visiting after about 20 minutes and three people trying to find the errant coat. All the coats are layered one on top of each other and our coat was at the bottom. The coat was finally retrieved but the whole debacle took so long we missed the entirety of our next event.  The situation was pointedly unaddressed by anyone in management"}
{"text":"A friend from Chicago and I planned a weekend away in early May, deciding to meet in the \"middle\"--Toronto. She is a celiac, so we were a little wary of Italian food/pasta. The staff at Buca was exceptional in dealing with her allergy. When we told our waiter, he asked questions to fully understand the issue and made sure everyone serving us was aware. They also could make ANY dish gluten free. I've never seen my friend happier or more attention paid to her allergy. She thoroughly enjoyed her rabbit ragu, and my mushroom gnocchi was delicious. 

Also, from reviews we read for places across the city, it seems Canadians are into bathroom. The bathrooms were great. Nothing weird here."}
{"text":"We've only dined there once during their soft opening but we had the most amazing meal! I understand their menu changed daily during this time so I'm not sure if these are currently available but we loved the nodini (bread knots), stuffed zucchini flowers, vongle pizza and tagliatelle (duck pasta). The milk and honey gelato was to die for.  We had an excellent experience there and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Buca is a trendy Italian place on King West with high ceilings and a cacophony of noise during peak hours. However, they have some really good food with apps and nibbles leading the way. Here are a couple of dishes I wanted to highlight (despite the poor lighting).

Pig's Ears
Orecchio Di Maiale is a pile of pig's ears with wild fennel salt. Crispy and a little chewy, this makes for a lovely start. I've had this dish before and thought it good, but it was absolutely stellar the last time I went. I almost ordered a second round.

Beet Salad
With the creamy Ontario buffalo mozzarella, preserved meyer lemon, and aged balsamic, this roasted beet salad made for a suitable dessert substitute. Really lovely melding of flavours and textures and worth every penny (most of it goes toward those dots of balsamic!). I salivate just thinking of this.

While chit-chatting with our server, he mentioned that there will be a bar-only menu coming up in the side-room where their enomatic lives. Given that there is much love for the appetizers and small bites over entrées on Buca's menu, I'm looking forward to checking that out!

(Copy and pasted from the blog. As always, a ton of photos and the menu are posted there.)"}
{"text":"Incredible food, wine, appetizers, burrata pizza and dolce + great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Extremely overly priced.  Food was better than average but not for the price. Portions are small too. I've been to other places that are better quality and cheaper.  I loved the bread knots but even that was pricey."}
{"text":"We went to Buca for a pre dinner show in January 2013. Yep, I did not forget the experience as it was a mixture of good and bad. 

The good: we went there early so I had a chance to read their Menu thoroughly, the food was authentic Italian \"fusion\" 

THE BAD: there was only a few tables for our 530 PM seating but they seated us near the kitchen. The service was not great until my daughter arrived and ordered  wine, (I don't drink so I had to settle for mineral water while waiting for her). 

The not-so-sure: the portions of everything were tiny. After ordering  3 breads, 4 cheeses, 4 pastas, salads , meat platter, and desserts, we were still hungry. May be they cater to peopl with tiny appetite. For almost 280 bill, we were hoping for a bit more,

The need-improvement: the servers were a bit indifferent to cold, and may be they preferred the folks who ordered bottles of wine ... We had a pregnant woman and a non drinker..."}
{"text":"I recently had the most perfect meal here! 

Buca has a dark, wine-cellar feel to it. There is a busier seating area near the entrance of the restaurant and a more intimate dining area on the other side of the restaurant. On this visit, we were seated in the quieter room. 

We started with the meat plate - choosing 3 different house-cured meats for $18.  We chose the pancetta, spicy pork sausage and salami which were served with 3 small sides - sautéed green dandelions, golden beets and beans. Since Buca doesn't have complimentary bread, we ordered 2 of their herb rolls ($1.50 each). The meats were delicious! Next time I'd like to get some cheese as well.

Our second starter was the eggplant parmesan ($14). This was the second time I've had this, and it was even better than I remembered. This is one of my favourite dishes (and I'm not just talking about Buca...). The ricotta and the creamy burrata was sandwiched between perfectly crispy eggplant slices. Highly recommended if you're a fan of eggplant.

For my main I went with the bigoli ($21) which consisted of duck egg noodles and duck ragu. All I can say about this dish is delish!

My boyfriend went with the pappardelle ($24) which was served meatless, in a butter sauce. The serving of this dish was particularly small, but was extremely delicious. My boyfriend often orders pappardelle when he sees it on the menu, and I rarely ever enjoy it, but this one was amazing.

We finished off our meal with the tiramisu ($12) which was the perfect way to end the meal. Although it was delicious, at $12 it was pretty steep considering the pasta dishes we ordered were under $25."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5 star review if it were based on food alone.  The fresh off the boat Italian staff were rude and continually checked out me and my friend and spoke about us, in Italian, while staring at our boobs."}
{"text":"Good service - attentive but not intrusive
Decent food - the pasta (lasagnette) was really good, but the pizza we had was a little bland. could have used more salt and wish we could have tasted more of the aged balsamic.i would go back again to try the pizza (albeit a different one) because this place has all the makings of a great pizza (fresh ingredients, great combination of toppings) but just needed more salt! desserts were a hit and a miss. the crema fritta was DELICIOUS (fried doughnut with a lemon cream filling and sitting on a pool of more cream - yum) but the tiramisu left us a little mystified. there wasn't much coffee flavour and it was more custard than anything else. it was lacking in the BEST part of a tiramisu - the bitter coffee flavour and the coffee soaked lady fingers! 

overall a 4 star because the service was good, the ambience was great and 50% of the food was excellent! the other 50% was ok - not terrible but not on par with its counterparts. it's definitely worth trying, but i would avoid the first pizza on the list and the tiramisu."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto for delicious and authentic Italian. It is on the expensive side, but the menu always has seasonal and local options, everything is made in-house, atmosphere is nice, and the service is great. Make reservations far in advance though if you're more than 2 people! Also servings are small as you're meant to eat in multiple courses."}
{"text":"I am sad to review Buca with a one star rating. After visiting Buca a couple of years ago and having a fantastic experience, I decided to revisit with my husband this past week. My 36 dollar gnocchi was way too cheesy and the lamb brain way to salty and the list goes on... nice atmosphere but definitely overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"3 stars because the service was lackluster for this level of restaurant, but the food was admittedly good.
We went here on a recommendation from a friend's trusted source. Our reservation was made in advance via Open Table and it was for 6pm on a Thursday night because apparently 7pm and onwards was completely booked.
When we arrived at the restaurant there was hardly anyone there. Even by 7, there were so many open tables, I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. 
Anyway, they asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out. We chose to sit inside and were seated in this dark dungeon of an area near the wine cellar where none of the other guests were seated. I'm sure this was due in part to the presence of my son (but he is soooo good in restaurants, honestly).
This was still alright with me, except for the number of fruit flies that would not leave us alone. One even made it into my husband's glass of wine. I pointed this out to our server and he measured out the amount of wine left in my husband's glass to replace it. He also saw us swatting at flies, but never offered to seat us elsewhere. It was embarrassing that a restaurant of this caliber would have this problem and not address it. It was unfortunate because the food was actually good. We had the cervella (lamb brain), nodini (bread knots), bigoli (duck egg pasta with duck offal ragu), pig's blood pasta, tiramisu, and panacotta. Should have ordered some veggies to balance out everything we ordered, but I was too busy swatting flies.
I would not recommend this place since there seem to be a multitude of other fine dining choices in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to Buca for the first time last weekend. The food was delicious and the pasta tasted freshly made. Highly recommend the mini garlic bread knots."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Although I'd avoid the deserts as they weren't on par with the rest of the excellent meal."}
{"text":"I would like to say this is why I prefer south Italian food, which this is northern, stricks me as (being half of both northern/southern) for better food and better value (4x the amount of it!) : 
I am 22 years old and went here with my boyfriend for our 5 years.. he chose it even though there was no menu online, which we would have liked to have seen. I felt bad cause when we arrived we saw how expensive it was, very sneaky not adding the menu. It was SUPER OVERPRICED AND TINY PORTIONS. My gnocchi was in a yellow cream sauce.. it did not look appealing, had probably 7 little gnocchi's and was stone cold! cream sauce shouldnt be STONE COLD.. my boyfriend also had cold pasta and a tiny portion.
I think its crazy CHARGING FOR BREAD, $8. I went to another italian resturant prior and got the exact same bread free (every customer as it should be with a meal!)
the waiter charged my bf and i the larger most expensive glass or wine without asking us!!! we got the bill and the WINE IS MASSIVELY OVER PRICED.. I have had much better wine muchhhhh cheaper at other italian restaurants. I was offended that we were automatically given biggest, most expensive glass without asking, cold food, and a SNOBBY attitude from the WAITER. I myself am Italian and felt he was. We also felt that we were VERY RUSHED OUT cause of our age compared to older customers (mind you my bf had the money too!) and given the bill before we even finished our wine and rushed with our plates.. Couples and people in there 20s are your future business and should be treated better.. now we will not be returning. we also left very hungry and went for crepes after! :/ (after ordering apps and a plate of pasta each)"}
{"text":"After catching a game at Rogers Centre we were STarrving.  No phone available to get on Yelp so we took a chance with Buca.  Inside and out the place is very nice.  Although the bread was fresh ,what italian restaurant charges for bread??? Buca does.  The menu is a bit confusing and if you ask the waiter he makes it even more confusing with his thick accent.  Basically we ordered two apps and two 17 inch pizzas,beer and sodas all for the hefty price of 240 and still came out HUngry.  The only thing I would go back for would be the goat cheese pizza which is mouth watering.  But the place is wayy to pricey and pretentious and does not believe in free bread BOO for that"}
{"text":"Amazing. One of the best finds in the city!  Pizza pasta and even bread knots, its all amazing.  They have great food in general and i would say the best white pizza in the city!"}
{"text":"Did I ever think I would eat so many pork blood-y things in a single meal?  I did not.  I'm pretty glad I did, though.  It was worth it to order the stupidly expensive, stupidly delicious truffle, taleggio, and duck egg pizza.  I wasn't really into the crowd or the room, but King West is not really my bag.  With the exception of the boring bread knots, everything was totally on point food-wise."}
{"text":"Genuine Italian food.  Very pricey wine list.  Hidden location, unless you know."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is AMAZING! I joined a few friends for dinner one night, and I've been back twice since. Its always consistant, the service is great, and the changing menu keeps it interesting.  The wine list compliments the food beautifully, though it can get a little pricey. Try the house made olives, they are the best in the city!
Buca has a really nice atmosphere too. High end without being pretentious."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the service was phenomenal. We went with the tasting menu, which was actually way too much food. If possible, the three of us should have split two tasting menus. Great presentation and execution. Would recommend this place if you're looking for something extra special and aren't too worried about your budget."}
{"text":"One of my most favourite places in the city for too many reasons to list here. Beautiful room. Great cocktails. An appropriately Italian wine list. Fresh, very well prepared dishes. Outstanding service by people who are passionate about what they are serving. A home run."}
{"text":"I've been looking for some good Italian food in Toronto for awhile.  Buca is definitely a hit.  It is expensive, so nice for special occasians.  Make a reservation, it was busy and we were there on a Monday night.

As recommended, the bread knots were delicious.  Bit sized, and so deadly because I could probably keep popping them in like candy.  I also loved the eggplant parmesean - crispy and grilled, sandwiched with ricotta and creamist buffalo mozzarella.

We also had the duck ragu pasta and one of the sausage pizzas.  The pizza was thin, full of herbs. 

I was disappointed that I didn't see the bone marrow ravioli on the menu.  It sounds like it would have been delicious.  Oh well, I guess that means another visit to Buca.  Darn!"}
{"text":"Came in here one night with my friend. Terrible terrible service. My friend was given her dirty fork back to her after it had been taken from our table. Our waitress was VERY snooty! I had just had surgery 2 weeks prior. The seating is VERY uncomfortable and the restaurant is NOT wheelchair accessible nor is it stroller friendly!!"}
{"text":"Whats up yelps, its your boy - no not drake your other boy from rexdale homie. Just got home from a heavy night of binge eating, I have a problem. My biggest problem is I don't get paid enough at my other job (I sharpen pencils for a living) so I can't support my eating habits. So if  I have my next 5 reviews at different Burger King's please understand.

I feel like this place should be called Sambuca cause I think they were drunk when they made the dishes & prices on this menu. I went with my family (9 of us) we sat in the corner it was nice  There was a brown guy on a date - if you take your girl here - your obviously tryin hide the fact that you were too lazy to think of a original place to take your girl out so you take her to a restaurant on king thinking you gonna be all posh. Whats the point, you eatin can food mon-fri. #Prech #Preyformeek

Anyways. We ordered the whole pig and the chef gave us the head...it was alright, some parts were really nasty like the pig cheeks, I say nasty because it was pretty much no flavor just loads of fat, I m pretty sure it wasn't cooked right. We also had pig ears which was nice and salty but it would've been better if it came with a dip or a sauce or something cause that stuff almost choked me. I also had the goat brain dish, I think it was a roll but I don't know the exact name for it. It was good, it had a nice slight gamy taste. But our overall decision was that it was a horrible experience -but shout out to our waiter, he was wicked he made our dish seem like its a damn show.

But I think my mom sums it the best.

It tasted like Fear Factor
- Mom

Anyways that ends my review - btw if you guys plan on going here, make sure you wear your pretentious hats!"}
{"text":"I really like Buca, especially now when you can sit on the patio. The food is great and they seem to have some Italian recipes that I haven't seen or tried anywhere else. It is a great place to go out on a classy dinner, or for a business lunch. Love their cheese plates - if you order one try testun di barolo. The place is quite expensive though, the portions are small so don't plan on sharing :-)"}
{"text":"GNOCCO FRITTO tuscan spiced crisp dumplings, lardo .
Dumplings were on the plain side, the cold cut was mainly driving all the taste. Wouldn't get this again

PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE preserved tomato, crisp eggplant, buffalo ricotta.
Super tasty and delicious,  portion on the small side."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Rustic and bueatiful. It does not feel like you are in Toronto. We sat on the patio during a warm summer night (2 of us) and we both felt amazing.

Service. Amazing. Very attentive and pleasent. We where able to enjoy our meal without the server on our backs every minute, but felt they where knowlegable and there if we needed anything. I wish service in this city could always be like this.

Food. The food was amazing. I've been to Italy several times, and the pizza here was better than any I've had there. Dessert was incredible as well, so save room. 

The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 and not 5 is because as mentioned by others, I do feel that some items where way too small for the price. The cured meats being the most rediculous. At that price, there better be more than 4 slivers of each. Pizza was the best bang for buck and besides desset, I feel was the highlight. I had a few other dishes, I can't recall all of them now, but they where all really good.

I say this is a great restaurant to go to and a great adition to the area. Dinner for 2 ran us around $250.00, so it is pretty steep. But all in all, I'd say it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! One of the better pizza places in the city! Unique option to cut your own pizza! Recommend duck related dishes"}
{"text":"The food is always great and not your usual boring pasta and pizza styles, but with some exquisite ingredients and combinations. 
I was also quite surprised and pleased by their coat check service, which is free and very handy during winter months."}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian who grew up eating fresh home cooked Italian meals, Buca is phenomenal.

I rarely go to Italian Restaurants cause they always seem to disappoint.

From the service, to the ambiance, dinner+ dessert, everything is exceptional.  The pine nut gelato is to DIE for.  

Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"First Impression: Went to buca last night with my girlfriend. I've heard great things and was very excited to dine there and see what the hype was about. Finding it was hard because it's around the corner of an alley way and the entrance was awkward I wasn't sure of I went threw the right door or not. We were quickly greeted by a server that was very nice and introduced us to the maitre d who took my coat and showed us to our table. Upon being sat at our table we were given a choice of water and given all the correct menus. I found the food menu's extremely confusing because they are in mostly Italian but our server was super helpful and gave us a rundown on every single thing and a little history on Italian dining and buca's concept.

Appetizers: I ordered the horse meat Carpaccio it was accompanied by some cured quail egg, truffles, capers and parmigiano. It was quiet good but it didn't blow me away.  My girlfriend had BC side stripe crudo wrapped with lardo and some rosemary ash on top, I enjoyed hers a bit more than mine but I also thought it was a bit too much lardo but very very tasty dish

Main Course: Here is where I found the hype. Hats off to Buca and one more praise to the kitchen from me. I hate myself for not remembering the name of this pasta I had but I am determined to find out and repost, forgive me.  My pasta was perfectly cooked accompanied by a lobster and scallop sausage, fiddle head's (my fav) and some spring onion flowers (I believe).  This dish was phenomenal blew me away it was done in some sort of yellow sauce reminded me of a light curry but not quite the lobster sausage made the dish explode with excitement and flavor, the fiddle head's brought nice colours and texture. My girlfriend had a winner aswell halibut with some sort of creamy puree, fresh chickpeas,  and hazelnuts which gave a beautiful surprise flavor and texture.

Desserts: I has an assortment of gelati, wild fennel, hazelnut, and garganzola. The first two were incredible but the garganzola was interesting... im not saying I didn't like it I admired the creative mind that came up with it but it just wasn't for me. My girlfriend had the creme frita, I don't remember much of this dish I was too focused on that garganzola lol, but she did finish her plate and was happy with it.

Overall I had an amazing experience and enjoyed my dinner at buca and definitely got my money's worth. I was especially impressed with our server his food knowledge and attentiveness were spot on. I gave Buca 4 stars because I was not blown away by the Appetizers but I will definitely go back and see if we can change that."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the way I was treated by the maître d'. I left immediately after having to interact with him. His condescending manner and style of addressing us on entering was so incredibly rude that I lost all desire and appetite. I see that most of the negative reviews on here reflect that same kind of experience with the staff. If I am about to spend a good deal of money on dining in an establishment I would expect that the experience be hospitable and respectful. I am happy that I did not and will not ever spend a dollar in this place. I often entertain clients and was doing so this night, but we moved on to Bent and had an incredible experience and meal. Life is too short for a place with this kind of attitude."}
{"text":"This unique Italian restaurant gives house-made a new standard to measure...ginger beer and tonic to salumi and formaggi-all made in house. The dishes, meant to be shared, were incredibly adventurous with outstanding flavor. The offerings were unique (horse carpaccio, lamb brains) and traditional. Enjoyed everything i tried, but the Nodini were delicious and the Olive Ascolane tops for me. Excellent bar offeringsx perfectly craftef cocktails and 5 star wine selection.

Fantastic decor and ambience coupled with impeccable service. This is a go to spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went in with fairly high expectations, but was sadly disappointed.  First of all, I should say that the service was exceptional.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  The food was another story.

We ordered a spaghetti dish with some kind of duck in a tomato sauce, which was bland and dry, as well as ravioli with burrata, which was pretty good.  The ravioli had pesto and toasted pine nuts on top, can't go wrong with fresh burrata.  

The pizza we were told we must try was the one with duck egg and shaved truffles.  Instead of a drizzle of yolk, the pizza was absolutely covered in pure egg yolk and it overpowered all other flavours.  It was way too rich. 

For dessert, the tiramisu was pretty good (some kind of crispy brulee type thing on top), and the panna cotta was nothing to write about.  

All in all, it was a fairly mediocre experience.  I was expecting more."}
{"text":"in a word - AWFUL. The night started with a waiter who advised us that we needed to order quickly because we could only have our table for 90 minutes (note: we were 15 minute early AND we were not told this when we booked). The meats were 'fatty' - the cheese 'was sparse' and the salads were a 'joke'. The only thing good about the night was the wine and it was rudely over priced. Trendy 'yes' worth going 'no'!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance at Buca - the warm lighting, wooden tables, the visible cured meat locker, and wine cellar just adds to an already cozy restaurant. The service was excellent, however the food was not up to snuff. Mind you they had food here that it'll be hard to find anywhere else. A few items we tried were fried pig's ear, lamb brain wrapped in bacon. I was pleasantly surprised with the pig ear, I was reluctant to try it at first, but man once i had a bite - it was good! The lamb brain, let's just say it has an interesting texture and taste. The bacon did nothing to mask the taste, which I wish it did. We also ordered some lamb skewers that were quite good.

For my meal i ordered a beet and bread crumb salad, and a cured meat pizza. Both dishes were a tad too salty for my liking. But the pizza crust was quite good. Perhaps i would've enjoyed my pizza if it had other toppings. Each pizza will come with scissors for you to cut. Brilliant! I believe this place has a lot of potential, each individual menu is date stamped so you know they constantly update it. For that they deserve a second chance, will definitely come back to try other items. I'm sure other friends at my table would've given 4 or 5 stars, just that i was unfortunate ordering what i ordered. Reservations are a must for Buca on the weekend, we had dinner at 5:30 and the place was packed by 6."}
{"text":"Oh wow yummy. I have visited this restaurant twice, and I loved it each time. Pasta is so delicious. I also tried pizza and fish entree, which were outstanding too. Service was excellent as our server was so courteous and helpful. The ambience is gorgeous. But overall experience was slightly let down by slow pace at which the foods came out."}
{"text":"I've fallen for this place!!

Down a mysterious alleyway is the entrance for the ultra sexy and sleek resto Buca.  Set in a historical boiler room with high ceilings and exposed brick walls, this restaurant has been garnering a lot of attention and most recently named one of the top restaurants for 2009 in Toronto Life Magazine.  It's no wonder the speakeasy feel creates a certain appeal for those only in the know and buzzing with energy. 
The service from the moment we arrived to the wait staff were attentive and amazing although we were warned otherwise.  Our server Jasper was knowledgeable and was attentive to all our needs. The menu changes daily with the availability of seasonal ingredients and it reads from cold dishes to hot ones from left to right and the general premise is Italian and specialty meats.  Waiting at the bar was a gorgeous cut of ham tempting us to order it and waiting to be thinly shaved. 
The things that we had:  the bread knots as a pre-appetizer - they looked like little buttery escargots and they were heavenly and so savory. We got veal carpaccio to sample some more of Buca's meat selection and it was well presented and very fresh.

For mains- we got spaghetti carbonara- a white pasta with panchetta.   It was very well flavoured with the saltiness of the panchetta and Parmesan with the creaminess of the sauce and pasta.  The veal stuffed agnolotti- perfectly tender and gamey pasta dressed with a fresh tomato sauce.  The duck pasta - very smoky and gamey in flavour and and the pasta was perfectly dressed.  We also ordered the prosciutto pizza because after seeing the gorgeous piece on the bar- I wanted to try some.  The pizza came as a giant rectangle with a perfect thin crust.  
We appreciated the scissors that came with the pizza instead of the knife.  The pizza was the show stopper of the evening for me as the crust had the 'crunch' factor and the prosciutto was pure goodness!"}
{"text":"Buca was an excellent dining experience, the staff were very attentive from the moment you walked into the door making it a perfect evening.  

The wine menu was vast and offered a wide variety for any taste.  The food was excellent and detail was put into each dish.  

Buca is definitely one of Toronto's top spots!"}
{"text":"Nice business and social oriented space. Food was exceptional well executed and complimented with decent cocktails. Highlight was the asparagus insulata and snail pasta. Sea bass was good, but bones and over powered by salt of olive, anchovies, salted lemon dominated the delicate fish. Bread was good, and worth the extra $5. Service was on par. You can't really go wrong here, food, service, space above average in the city."}
{"text":"As luck would have it, as part of my job I do need to entertain business clients on a regular basis. This allows me to sample some of the best, (and worst) this city has to offer. Buca is definitely one of the Best. It was a real treat. As soon as we glanced at the menu we (3 of us, all chef's) would do \"Chef style\". Just order tons, share and don't be afraid to eat with your hands!. Much to the chagrin of the table next to us...Of the 14 items we picked off the menu only 2 were so, so and the rest were a gastro delight.. The wine list although a little pricey features some stellar selections and our waiter was also a cert sommelier. So his picks for us were bang on. The ambiance is cool, hip and warm in that old Toronto kinda way. Chef Rob was off that night and his exec Sous Ryan had taken the helm. It's always good to know that the food will be on point even when the big guys away. Being a chef myself it's always a bone of contention when i don't feel i get value for my dollar. Buca does it right and charges accordingly. It'll be a go to place from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food very new and interesting flavours. Portions aren't to big and not to small so you can easily have desert. The nodini (bread knots) are fantastic. The wine list is extensive but great variety. The open kitchen concept is awesome on a busy night seeing the cooks and chefs work is something impressive. I've gone to Buca twice and will be returning next time I'm in Toronto for sure."}
{"text":"Buca was simply a delight. The room is great. The service is charming. Oh, and then there's the food...

We ordered a few entrees and shared them amongst the group. We went down this path because all of the preparations sounded too good to limit yourself to just one choice. That said, the Gorgonzola gnocchi and the tagliatelle with the duck ragu were both standouts. The portions, as someone mentioned in their review, aren't exactly Olive Garden-esque; but I would argue that's a good thing. Prices seemed fair too.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying something new."}
{"text":"The sea bass was super salty, for the price they need to come up with a better recipe for the sea bass. The pasta was not what we expected at all! The sauce was very bland and we had to get it changed. 
The pizza was good/decent. The three stars is mostly for our server and the ambience."}
{"text":"What a place! We sat outside, wedged between interesting old industrial buildings, really great atmosphere. Looks like the inside is equally cool, and very lively.  The servers were stellar (Simone & Gianni), all their suggestions were incredible. The caprese w mozzarella emulsion is a brilliant take on the traditional salad, the bread knots-crazy!! Melanzane Parmigiana, delicious. Still dreaming of that duck pasta. Great wine list. We couldn't consider dessert but the manager brought us some mini biscotti + Sardinian digistivo...this place is firing on all cylinders, may have to move Toronto."}
{"text":"You had me at \"warm bread knots\"!!!! 

These are just so good and way too addictive...brushed with rosemary infused olive oil and topped with garlic and sea salt. 

For starters, enjoyed a wonderful cheese plate, which included Buffalo di Mozzarella, a Pecorino infused with Truffles and a Parm Regianno, served with incredible preserves, one of which was a Meyer Lemon.

The main I have to mention is the Polpette di Bisonte Pizza with bison meatballs, preserved red pepper sauce with fried eggplant, bufala ricotta and salsa alle erbe.
Delish!

The one drawback and why I am not giving it 5 stars is the overall darkness in the restaurant.  
Yes, I know, it's the vibe they are going for, but it makes it hard to see and appreciate your food and presentation.
Taking photos is nearly impossible."}
{"text":"A group of us celebrated a mile-stone birthday here in March 2012. My friends had been here many times before, however this was my first visit.

At the risk of sounding over critical - it was good, but not sure worth the crazy hype? My friends are \"foodies\" and our group is not shy about getting out the wallet for a quality dinner... but hmmm....

We had the full experience from buying drinks in the bar, a couple bottles of prosecco, wine, water, appetizers, mains, desert, etc!  The whole enchilada!  

There are a tremendous amount of \"manager\" type people hustling about and mingling with select guests. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food, recommendations and suggestions.

Our guest of honor was disappointed her seating request was not honored even though the reservation was made 3 months in advance.

I guess, check it out for yourself... perhaps you will find a new home!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Everything about it is fantastic! We have been many times and have never had a bad experience. I always opt for the gnocchi when available, and have never been disappointed. The bread knots are fabulous, and I miss the sausage stuffed deep fried olives - amazing. Hopefully they will be back next time! The cheeses are always wonderful as well. The Sommelier always matches our bottle of wine perfectly to our meal selections. The wait staff is amazing - I love someone who can say \"I don't know but I will find out\". 

Tough to get a reasonably timed reservation at the last minute, but you never know, sometimes you get lucky!"}
{"text":"Must get the pizza. Listen to the server on wine. I found the cheese plate not very adventurous or interesting. The duck ragu is as good as people say. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food no doubt! I never write reviews on restaurants, but I believe that BUCA needs my review. The family and I went there for dinner and were placed in a fruit fly infested dungeon by the wine cellar in the back (maybe an overstatement). My guess is that the BUCA staff tucked us away into that darkroom because they saw we had our 4 year old son with us. I didn't mind that because this restaurant was recommended to us by a very good source. 
However, the waiter Scott looked me straight in the eye while I was swatting away those fruit flies and did not come over and ask what is the matter? Not only that, my wife pointed out that there was a fruit fly in my overpriced glass Brunello, but Scott the waiter was not clued in that there was a problem. Bottom line is that their service sucks for their price point of food, and it is not kid friendly. If you want to have a family dinner don't go there. They will put you in that dungeon."}
{"text":"Service is king and man this place delivered; So much so I couldn't resist the attention my table received that we ate and drank way too much (but enjoyed every moment). The interior is wide open, a lot of concrete, but nicely lit, clean and comfortable. As for the food we tried many different dishes and loved every one of the. I wish I could remember all the dishes, but I can't. We devoured the appetizers, the entrees and desserts. I do remember the pizzas are thin crusted, light and full of flavor. If that wasn't enough you cut your slice with big scissors. I thought it was fun."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give bad reviews, but I just don't get it.

(Let me state now that I'm not a fan of rich foods, so this definitely plays into my review)

Everyone says this place is amazing...most of the reviews (on Yelp and elsewhere) and even my friends who I've spoken with.  The restaurant was very cool and the ambiance was very nice, so that's a plus.  But the food was, in my opinion, terrible.  I ate there last night (Jan. 26, 2011) and I left wishing I had gone to Pizza Pizza or McDonald's.

I've eaten my fair share of Italian food (both American-ized, and during my travels throughout Italy), and Buca did neither any justice.

So, we walked into the restaurant to find the place very busy, and the ambiance very cool.  After making our way to the bottom of the stairs, we were standing there for several minutes among some departing guests waiting for their coats, so it wasn't easy to find where to go to claim our reservation.  Not until a couple minutes after they left, did someone approach us and ask \"has somebody helped you\".  Finally at our table, we asked our waiter for some wine recommendations, and he was not really well-informed.  And we noticed he only recommended glasses that were about $20 and above...

We ordered our food with much difficulty because the menu listed all kinds of things that I had no idea what they meant (and I consider myself more than well-dined and travelled, so I've seen more than my fair share of fancy menus).

We got our appetizers, the bread knots with garlic and oil - this was the best part of the meal...and the only thing I would ever eat again and recommend.

We got our mains, sea bass and the funghi pizza.  Both were gross.  I know that's a matter of personal taste, but that's what a review is, so don't hate on me.

After we ate what we could, we opted out of dessert (which we usually would have ordered).  I couldn't get the nasty taste of the cheese out of my mouth.  So you can say I left with a bad taste in my mouth.

The price actually wasn't that bad.  We had 2 small apps, 2 mains, 2 glasses of wine for about $100 + tip.  But considering how much I disliked the food, I was not thrilled to pay that much.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I am not a fan, and that's my review."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  I've had better.  I also think the day we went they were out of basil so Buca used something else.... they claimed it was basil but this little leaf had no aroma...and I know my basil!  Also the door was left open and there were flies everywhere which made it impossible to enjoy!  The food was at best mediocre...We had all the \"favourites\" and nothing left me wanting more. Oh and the garlic knot things that everyone keeps going on about are hard as rocks.  Go to North of Brooklyn for some yummy dough balls.  I feel like people are brainwashed to believe this is the it spot in Toronto because Jamie Oliver said so! Well sorry ... It was a no for me and my friends.  Over priced and over done.  Terroni and Lo Zingaro are so much better (downtown) for flavourful and simple but good Italian dishes.. oh and Libretto for pizza of course.  Lo Zingaro also does a killer Roman pizza!  Or just go up to Woodbridge for some great Italian food!  But I must say the servers at Buca were nice.   Thats it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

Over priced, unfriendly staff and mediocore food. Nothing special."}
{"text":"had their cheese plate, and 2 pasta dishes. Pasta was very well prepared, texture was awesome. I find this place a bit over priced, but it makes sense given the area."}
{"text":"I called Buca on Friday night after work asking if they would accept a walk in for 2. The manager was very polite on the phone and offered one of their communal high top tables. 

Service was excellent from the moment my friend and I got there. The manager knew it was our first time and even offered us a glass of wine to start and some type of liquor to end our evening. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us informative yet brief historical backgrounds into some of the wines and dishes we ordered.

All of the food came out very fresh and was DELICIOUS. Their bread knots are so crispy on the outside but oh so soft on the inside. I highly enjoyed their duck pasta... my mouth is watering as I am typing this and reminiscing over the flavours. 

If you like Terroni, then you will LOVE what Buca has to offer."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This trendy king west restaurant was nice enough to take a couple friends and myself last minute new years eve. The owners were more then accommodating. And the food was amazing! Bread knots and apple chicken pizza were my favourites. The wine selection is endless. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hidden behind an alley is a small, vintage restaurant with friendly staff and delicious pasta. This place gets busier as the night progresses, so make sure you come early or make a reservation. I had a booking for 6pm on a Saturday and had no problems with getting a seat. 

We ordered some cured meats (horse, goose and beef), a Bigoli (duck meat pasta) and the highly raved scissor-cut pizza. Cured meats were interesting - it's my first time having horse and goose so I can't really judge. Small portion, good for a starter dish. 

However, I absolutely loved the pasta. It's hand cranked and you can tell because it's not as soft and goop-y as some other pastas you might get outside. A very good balance between the sauce and shredded duck meat. I would come here again and again just for this!

The pizza was very good as well. I personally like my crust thin, and this is as thin as it gets. Crispy crust, fresh sauce and cheese, doesn't get soggy after a while. A-ok!

Buca is a little expensive, but I would definitely come back for celebrations in the future!"}
{"text":"Our dinner at Buca was heavenly. I highly recommend it! It's pricey but great for a once-in-a-blue moon splurge or business dinner. Arrive in the mood for wine! They have a huge wine list of all Italian wines.

Our waiter did most of the ordering for us, so I don't remember the names of the dishes we loved, but here's the descriptions:

- Go for the cheese/ meat platter for appetizer. The fresh buffalo mozzarella is insane! All cheeses are paired with jams and meats with pickles and/or olives 
- Get the warm purple olives
- If you like eggplant, they have an amazing spin on Eggplant Parmesan.
- The bread knots are fresh and addictive
- Hot dulce de leche donuts for dessert if you can handle it. Not too sweet. Amazing with the homemade gelati.

I'll definitely go back next time i'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Buca which literally means \"mouth\" in Italian couldn't be a more fitting introduction to this restaurant. This hot spot is all about the senses from the moment you open the door till the time you step back out onto King street you feel that you have fallen down the rabbit hole and you won't want to return! 

It's all in the details...The staff will speak proper Italian to you while making sure \"everything is just so.\" Wine and water have been selected with taste and elegance in mind and patrons are even given scissors to cut their own pizza at the table. 

Was I impressed? ... More than impressed - I had a grin on my face the whole meal. Food can be so nostalgic. I was definitely re-living moments from a summer spent in Firenze. 

Maybe to good to be true for Toronto. This is a world class eatery not to be missed."}
{"text":"Dinner at Buca was OK on the night we went, but it was a Sunday so atmosphere was lacking somewhat. I also wish the menu included some of the items in the pictures that other reviewers had because the night we went, there wasn't anything overly mind-blowing to choose from, though everything we had was good--just not spectacular which was what I expected as Buca has always been highly recommended.  

We originally planned to go to Terroni as I was craving one of their pizzas which kind of comes close to the pizza of all pizzas I had in Milan, but their lineup was too long and I was DAMN hungry so we headed for Buca where we were able to snatch up a table right away. If you've never been, it's on King--next door to Cheval--they're separated by a laneway that leads to Buca's doors. Go through the doors and down the stairs to discover a beautiful space with exposed brick walls (I know, cliche~), and two dining rooms (one is more a wine cellar), dim lighting...romantic if you want it to be. 

We ordered:
- the nodini were OK; they're adorable little nubs of bread doused in oil & garlic, but I probably won't bother ordering them next time
- lamb skewers - I let my friend go to town on those and he was practically squealing with delight between bites whereas I am not a lamb fan, though I wish I were!
- breaded, fried eggplant layered with fresh basil leaves, parm & ricotta and a squirt of burrata on top - judging from the description, I was kind of expecting something similar to eggplant parmaggiano (minus the tomato sauce) which is one of my favourite dishes but instead it was very bland; not a single ingredient besides the basil offered any flavour  
- salsiccia pizza - very good pizza, served on a long cutting board and as everyone else mentioned: scissors for your convenience, which I've only ever seen in Korean restaurants
...I was torn between the veal tenderloin and the sea bass, when my eye caught their list of pizzas and their scamorza seemed to be a close fit to the pizza I would have had at Terroni so I went with that. While I enjoyed every bite of it, instead of us ordering two pizzas, I should have had one of the other mains so as to get a real taste of chef Gentile's range of talent (I'm sure he's wonderful). You know what this means...I'll have to go back.
- Buca's got this crazy-extensive tome of wines so if you're a wine-lover, I am sure you'll be pleased.  
- (Wait, I'm not done!) We shared the dessert of 3 big balls of gelato of your choosing. Ours included lavender (my friend nearly threw up when he tasted it; I guess it's not for everyone), hazelnut (TONS of nuts throughout, like I've never seen--which I loved), and blood orange (SO GOOD), all sprinkled with toasted spices. I am guessing they make their own gelato, which was clearly the most popular dessert.

Along with your bill, you get the cutest little packet containing a tiny nougat-ball with their card attached. I love it when restaurants go the extra mile with such small details! Service was excellent--I always get a kick out of places that insist on reciting your order back to you as each dish is presented at your table, though I'm not sure all the waiters were Italian as many suggest. Whatever the case, I found most of their service to have a real old-school polished-ness about it which is not terribly common, so that was nice. 

Considering this was an unplanned, passing-by situation on a Sunday night, the meal was a bit of a splurge, though not totally insane. Buca is definitely on the pricey side but prime location, excellent service, and chef Gentile all come at a price, though I will definitely go back to Buca as I am curious to try their other dishes which I am sure are amazing. To say I LOVE them is a bit of a stretch (for now) but their food is fresh and service professional, which is enough to warrant another go."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Excellent service, Excellent atmosphere on a special day
Restaurant took care of the flowers, took care of the champagne, everybody was super  nice, and very accommodating. Every bite had burst of flavor.

And definitely try the tiramisu! - it is nothing like your grocery store or normal restraunt tiramisu"}
{"text":"Huge disappointement.  Food was below average and lacked flavor.  The branzino was overcooked and tasteless.   The Bigoli was undercooked and ordinary.   The service was subpar.  The only thing worth while in what we ordered were the brussels sprouts and the \"agrumi e ricotta\". Perhaps our expectations were too high...?!?!"}
{"text":"What a lovely dinner. Waiter and sommelier were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and willing to spend time with us, and waitstaff was very careful about my husband's nut allergy. Shared ricotta e fruita, melanzane parmigiano, stuffed zucchini blossoms, duck breast with sun choke purée and berries, branzino, and pasta with mussels. Dessert was the pork blood and chocolate tart with tonka bean gelato (really, it was terrific). We are loving the food scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"We were directed here by some locals when Lee was closed due to a power outage.  I heard great things about it on the way over, and heard several people comment to their friends on the place while inside.

The owners of this joint struck gold with the word of mouth advertising, but from what i can tell the reputation isn't exactly deserved.  The place is totally overrated.  Those fried olives?  Presented, fried, and tasted like average bar food.  Not terrible, but expected a lot more given how this place was representing itself.  

Tasted a couple on entrees and desserts.  The panna cotta itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great to me.  I LOVE panna cotta, and theirs might have been better if it wasn't overwhelmed by a syrupy fruit compote-type addition to the top.

I saw another reviewer called this place overrated and I'd agree.."}
{"text":"Place is alright, definitely not what everyone hypes it up to be."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Very knowledgeable staff who are very polite and easy to talk to. Best food I have had in my life and I will be a lifelong customer. The nodini is a great snack to start with. Menu changes frequently so there is always great variety!"}
{"text":"Great food, and love the atmosphere. The pizzas are really top-notch, inventive fresh ingredients (such as zucchini flowers at the right time of the summer) and crispy crust. The bread knots are worth breaking your no-carb diet.

The menu changes frequently so it's hard to recommend specific dishes, but I've never had a meal that I didn't enjoy, including meat, seafood, pasta and pizza. They cure many of their own meats and serve a great salumi (charcuterie) platter. Great wine list with many Italian selections (as you would expect) and a good cocktail menu to start.

The outdoor patio is nice: since you're down a laneway off King, it's quiet and flanked with planters full of rosemary."}
{"text":"Buca is a great upscale Italian restaurant located in the King West section of Downtown Toronto. 

It's a lavish, high end venue, and the attention to detail is astounding. The waiters are professional, courteous and above all else informed about the food and drinks. 

Even the patrons give off the notion that they are of a more affluent background and this place was full when I went with my girlfriend. Our table was not the greatest but we didn't have reservations so can hardly complain about that. 

Here's why this restaurant was great.

1. The Atmosphere / Vibe was off the walls cool. You can really feel the ambience 

2. The service while slow but the waiters were pleasant and professional.

3. The meal was made with fresh ingredients and was definitely made when ordered


Here's where the restaurant lost the 1 star.

1. The prices are extremely high. I think there are better places to go for the same price.

2. The portions were small especially for an Italian restaurant

3. The food preparation and service was very slow. 

All in all, it's a great high end Italian restaurant. Try it out sometime but keep an eye on that bill. It will make your wallet wince in pain if you're not too careful."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. The bread knots were delicious as advertised. Then had the halibut which was very interesting and overall enjoyable. A great combination of flavours. Tiramisu for dessert which was definitely too heavy and thick, very filling."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. The vibe was intimate, food is generally very well done. I don't know if I found it exceptionally memorable though.

Couldn't hear my partner because the space is not exactly well designed for good acoustic. 

Great choices of wine."}
{"text":"Buca was such an amazing experience ! We made reservation for 5PM to celebrate a special birthday. The restaurant is located on the side of the building. When we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host who directed us to our table. We were the first ones to arrive in the restaurant. The restaurant itself had dimmed lighting with opera playing in the baxkground, so the atmosphere was more fit for a romantic dinner. They have a very good selection of food on the menu, ranging from cheese board (choose three for $18), appetizer, entree and main course. They also have a very large selection of wine, 6 menu pages worth. Each item had a small description at the bottom helping diners understand exactly what it is that they're ordering. The menu had the current date stamped on it. The waitress explained to us that the menu changes almost everyday as the head chef wants to serve the freshest ingredients that the market has to offer each day. 

We ordered the pizza with spicy pork sausage, gnocchi, and sauteed new brunswick scallops. The waitress informed us that it will come in the order of pizza, gnocchi, and lastly, the seared scallops. The pizza was served on a neat little cutting board, with a pair of scissors for cutting the pizza. Now note that this is not your typical Americanized pizza. This pizza was longer and thinner. The crust was paper thin, topped with tomato, basil, and the in house spicy pork sausage. It was light, and each bite was packed with incredible flavour. Next came the gnocchi. The serving size of the gnocchi was much smaller than expected, we received a total of 5 pieces of gnocchi. However, each was filled with pesto sauce inside. When you bite into it, the pesto sauce bursts in your mouth. The gnocchi had a good bite to it, with a hint of cheese. Lastly, we received the scallop dish. The plating of these scallops was impeccable. Everything on the plate from the sauce to the scallops were aligned perfectly. The combination of the scallop sauce + scallop created this perfect harmony. I had requested for the sorbet trio to be served at the end of our meal as the \"birthday dessert\". They brought out the chocolate, basil, vanilla sorbet with a lighted candle. The sorbets were incredible ! They were all so so light and refreshing. 


As we waited for our bill to come, the manager came over to our table with a box with the date stamped on it. It was given to us as a birthday gift. Inside the box, there was fresh pasta, pasta sauce and cheeses to go with it. We made it for dinner the following night, it was such a wonderful and sweet little gift. 


The whole dinning experience was incredible ! We really felt like we were transported to italy.  I don't think I have ever written such a long yelp review for any other restaurants because that's how amazing this place is, it deserves an incredibly long review."}
{"text":"This is the spot to celebrate a birthday or an anniversary. They sure do make you feel special. Everything about the service here is on point. We tried every dish recommended by our waiter Tyler and we got exactly what we were looking for and it was all delicious. I do suggest getting cheese and meat to start with - just sets the mood right and their selection is amazing. Also, the patio is wonderful of the weather is right."}
{"text":"Amazing meal and service. We came in for dinner with a medium sized party. The service from the start to finish was perfect. The food was all very good. The bread and pizzas were excellent. Everything here was well done, I was very impressed with the quality of the food, and ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience and a perfectly executed meal. We've been waiting to try this place and we weren't disappointed at all, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner but confused service. Had 3 different servers and wasn't sure who was responsible for our table. Asked about wine, and sommelier disappeared. However, pasta and branzino were delicious."}
{"text":"A truly five star experience. 

Walk down an alleyway and then step inside an industrial space-high ceiling brick walled room, an open bar area, and a awe-inspiring chandelier as a hanging centerpiece. The menu changes daily, and stamped with the current date. Even the cocktails are seasonally inspired. 

We are seated in the dining room with the lower ceilings-more enclosed, more initimate, and the atmosphere was bustling. Cocktails-I started off with a Autunno a Belluno: whiskey, house made fig preserve, and cinnamon. A sweet drink, with bursts of fig flavour. It was so good I wanted to order three more of these. 

It took us a while to look through the menu since everything looked good, and we just couldn't decide. After long moments of contemplation, we finally made our decisions.

For a starter, we got a parmiagiana di melanzane: preserved tomato and fried eggplant layered with bufala ricotta and burrata cheese. This was a marriage of ingredients that went perfectly together. The textures of the fried eggplant and the burrata cheese mingled together just right. 

For pastas, we got the:

Bigoli: hand cranked duck egg pastas with duck ragu, mascarpone, and basil. So flavorful, and the pasta was truly divine. Just the right chewiness, with the smoky flavours of the duck and the mascarpone heightening the flavour of the dish. The addition of basil complemented it perfectly. 

Tortelli: goose, foie gras and porcini mushroom filled pasta with Ottawa valley sweet butter, toasted hazelnuts, crisp rosemary and melot 'vincotto'. This was my favourite. Probably one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted in my life. Each tortelli was wrapped with so much flavour, and the sweet butter sauce drenched over it with the crispness of the hazelnuts and the rosemary....I am salivating as I write this. 

As the finale: the dessert. 

Tortellini di mela cotogna: roasted quince stuffed pasta with burrata dolce,honey, hazelnut croccante and chianti vincotto. Another memorable dish. A perfect harmony of the sweetness makes this the perfect ending to an already perfect meal."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Italian so it definitely surprised me that I liked Buca as much as I did. This definitely isn't the cheesy, saucy, gooey Italian food that is so unappealing to me. This food was fresh, lively, and flavourful without relying on gooey, melted cheese and way too much sauce. 

We tried a couple of their pizzas. They were both excellent. The margarita was quite fresh and delicate tasting. We had a charcuterie board and the salamis were all delicious. 

We shared some pasta: the carbonara and one with a rosé sauce (I don't remember what it was exactly since I didn't do the ordering). I thought I'd prefer the carbonara, but I actually preferred the one with the rosé. I don't think they separated the egg all that cleanly on our pasta and I detected some of the white in taste and texture. It wasn't that pleasant, especially since the yolk was so large (goose egg) so it cooled down the pasta considerably and that made the presence of the bit of white all that more off-putting. 

Service was really seamless and efficient. 

If you're going to go Italian, this is the way to do it. Maybe just avoid the carbonara and go for a different pasta instead."}
{"text":"I personally don't get the hype with this place. Food was good but not as special and amazing as I've heard other comment.  Space is cool and vibe is good when it's busy."}
{"text":"Perfetto is the only word I need to describe my experience at Buca.

Eating at Buca is like *really* seeing someone for the first time. 
You didn't expect it but all of a sudden...surprise!  
Confusion.
Warmth.
Excitement.
...Just beautiful.

I don't know what it is... a magical combination of a gorgeous venue, exceptional service, and delicious food ...that makes you feel like you are making memories.
..Or maybe it's just the wine!  They have one of those ultra modern automated wine dispensing machines.

This place is packed on the weekends.  I would make a reservation ahead of time.  We ended up waiting at the bar and sipped cocktails.
When it was time to be seated, the staff checked our coats and we were led to the smaller more intimate back room.
It's neat how you walk by the cold room, which displayed all the cured meats.  

The menu is extensive and changes daily.  Each menu has a date stamped on it.  There are lamb brains and other unique items, so eating here can always be an adventure!

We ordered several items:
Eggplant - Perfectly soft, flavorful, with crispy breading for texture. 
Cured meat platter - Pretty good.  Can't complain.
Garlic bread knots - They sure were garlicy, oily, and tasty.

As for the service, if there was a reality show called Canada's Next Top Server, our waiter would have been a top contender.  Super knowledgeable about the food and he was very attentive....he was a server superstar!

Overall, I had such a wonderful dining experience here.

Buca... ti amo!     @)--'---,---
Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredibly attentive staff. However, there attention to pay attention can rub some people the wrong way like you're being rushed to finish up. Great wine and cocktail menus but beer options need a bit of work."}
{"text":"The establishments entire business was in the basement.  We sat on the small side where the noise is piercing and doest get any better.  The food overall was solid and most of the dishes were prepared well.  Some dishes should have been warmer than they were but the food was solid.  The other side of the restaurant had great acoustics and was a much more pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience! Went with my girlfriend on a Friday evening. We actually showed up 20 mins late for our reservation but they kept our spot... despite being really busy. Our waiter was amazing. Made some great recommendations. Very attentive despite how busy it was. 

The food here is killer. So flavorful and authentic. Had to try the pig ears! Interesting texture but once is enough! My only complaint really was that is was really loud. Not the best date place, but the amazing food and service make up for it. Price wise - it's not cheap but you at least walk away feeling like you got what you paid for. Would definitely visit again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Lovely service: Coat check-in at the front, dietary restrictions were readily and easily accommodated, frequent water glass top-ups, helpful menu suggestions and recommendations.

Romantic and intimate atmosphere (though on the very dimly-lit side, as we saw several tables using their phones as flashlights to read the menus), with high, open ceilings and dangling, exposed light fixtures and brick walls.

I really enjoyed the fried, pink, Nova Scotia shrimp served with heads and tails still on, and the perfectly grilled branzino dotted with bariole olives and curlicues of preserved lemon peel.  The soft pillows of lamb's brain wrapped in prosciutto (cervello) were delicious and its accompanying caper agliata served as perfect foil.  My husband really enjoyed his beef tartare, but found the mise-en-place to have issues:  He found lots of broken crab shells inside his truffled seafood pasta, pin bones in the branzino, and a few other small surprises.  Considering the pasta was $65, we were a bit surprised to find that had surprise shells in it.  Otherwise though, every component was cooked perfectly.

He received a little box of ready-to-cook fresh pasta at the end of the night from the sous-chef as a birthday gift, and happily made it last night.  So all in all, I think he'd be happy to go to Buca again - I know I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Getting to Buca was an adventure for us. We were visiting Toronto from DC for the Canada Day/4th of July weekend. I originally planned for us to do Buca on the Friday evening we were going to arrive, but our plane was delayed 5 hours! I had to cancel and rebook for later in the week. I actually debated rebooking at all. I'm glad I did! This place was the best restaurant of our trip and my boyfriend thinks it's one of the best restaurants we've been to. I should also note that my boyfriend is gluten free and the restaurant was 100% accommodating of his allergy. On any given night, that have 1-3 gluten free pastas they've made! We are huge charcuterie fans, so we started with a meet and cheese plate and a delicious Montepulciano. Everything was fantastic. Our next dish was the Insalata di Pomodoro. Let me tell you, this put every caprese salad I have ever had to SHAME! The 40 day ricotta forte melts in your mouth. I think we would have ordered 5 more of these if we could. We practically licked the plate clean. We next moved to our pasta dishes. I wanted to be able to share with my boyfriend so I ordered the gluten free pasta as well - we got the Bigoli with gluten free spaghetti and the Trofie with gluten free penne. These pastas were amazing. I'm Sicilian and the gluten free pasta game can be tricky but these were on point. You would never know! The bigoli pasta was unbelievable. The duck mixed with mascarpone was exquisite. The trofie pasta was equally good. I'd never had octopus in pasta but it was delicious. I'm also a HUGE advocate for peas in pasta. It makes everything better! For dessert we did a few scoops of their gelato. Heavenly across the board. Well done, Buca!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's worthy to try. Gnudi was a bit dry.. Pork blood pasta was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here last night. Best Italian meal we've ever had outside Italy. Rustic atmosphere, though lighting a bit on the dark side. Italian staff who were knowledgable and helpful with meal and wine choices. Great starters and bread. Mains of duck ragu and pizza were amazing. Desserts equally impressive. Good selection of wines which is well matched to food. Attentive staff throughout. Not cheap but worth it"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The bread was good, but at at restaurant like this, should have been free. Salumi was decent, but has nothing on Van Gameren. Pig ear needed to be braised longer before they were fried, and were bland. Should have been served with citrus, or some kind of dip. Mains were small, and mostly bland. We had the branzino, which was good, but boring. The black cod was pretty bland as well. The pasta with scallop sausage was boring and the sauce was uninspired. Tasted basically of lemon. The sausage stuffing in the quail overwhelmed the delicate quail flavour. Overpriced for pretty basic food. I will not return."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner as we had only heard great things from others and the reviews online checked out. We were not disappointed. We had reservations for 7pm (on a Wednesday evening) and were about 15 minutes late. The staff was extremely accommodating to this, although there were no tables outside at the moment (and we started our evening in the main dining room) the host came to us later to offer us a table outside which we graciously accepted - a definite point for good service here. We decided to have the 6-course summer tasting menu with wine pairing - this is STRONGLY recommended if you have the time (and the funds, as it was $125/person) to support this as it was about a three hour long dinner by the time we left, completely worth it in my opinion! We got to try what seemed like everything on the menu including 6 different wine pairings which complemented the food perfectly. The service was impeccable with our water glasses and wine glasses staying full the entire night. If you haven't been you must go - such an amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"Innovative Italian food for those who love flavor. We had an excellent dinner. We started with the sopresatta pizza. This was the weakest part of the meal. The crust is thin cracker like crust. The toppings were good but I would recommend the pasta dishes instead. The pizza was ok but the other dishes were superior. We had the pork blood pasta with the smoked burrata. Heavenly. But wait the meal just getting even better. The scallops were perfect. We also had the milk poached veal which was perfectly complimented by the roasted tomatoes. The peas with lardo were also very tasty. Finally, we ended with the polenta cake. Warm and topped with marscapone, it was a nice finish although I would have liked it better with a more tart fruit than the cherries they used. 

The portions were perfect for sharing. The prices are similar to if not less than you would pay in major cities for this level of quality. It is rare that I don't know what ingredients are used in an Italian restaurant whether in Italy or the U.S. But this menu was so different. We wanted to order even more dishes. A great place for good eaters. The wines by the glass our served recommended worked well. The service was attentive but not intrusive. Overall I wish they were in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"If you've been to Rome, eaten authentic pajata (where the f&@$ are the intestines--I want to chew on a baby intestine!), know where properly prepared puntarelle are supposed to take you, this place will not be reflective of the massive hype. Sad. I'll keep looking for authentic Roman in Toronto. Open to suggestions."}
{"text":"I have been to Buca about a half dozen times. It is the best restaurant in Toronto...period."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've ever had!

Dinner
Ambience:4.5/5 (rustic)
Service: 5/5 (when I dropped my napkin, it was immediately replaced without any prompting. I didn't even realize I had dropped it!)

Food: 5/5 
Crushes some of the Michelin starred chef run or critically acclaimed (NYT) restaraunts we've eaten at. 
What we had: bread knots, cured meats, cheese, preserves, rabbit pasta, lamb, cauliflower and artichokes. For desert we had tiramisu :) Every dish was very good to .... So good you'd be passing out from multiple foodgasms good.

Value: 4.5/5 
Pricey. But worth it!

Final word: So good my partner proposed we get married here (a few times)!"}
{"text":"Good not great ... Great space and feel and the service was very attentive. The food was ok but nothing special and definitely not worth the hype. The mains were salty AF. The Branzino tasted like someone over grilled it and dipped it in salt, the sauce for the filetto di manzo could well have been Campbell's soup with 3000 mg of sodium. The tomato salad was good but lacked fresh tomatoes ...in August... Not worth the money... There are much better places to spend your money in Toronto"}
{"text":"I came here for a work dinner and everything was absolutely delicious. Everything you order is to share so I highly recommend going with a big group to get a chance to try a variety of dishes. Everything was very flavourful and delicious. This might not be for everyone - our group did have disagreements on whether some dishes were too peppery, salty etc. I tend to prefer savoury dishes so I really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"For Italian food done right, with a touch of sophistication (truffles, anyone?) Buca is amazing! OMG, it was so hard to get a table for a weekend night. But, with a little help, we landed a 7pm slot for 4. The drinks were seasonally-inspired and I ended up with a fig and whiskey concoction. 
The Cheese plate should be a part of the meal, whether it is a starter or a finisher- as dessert. For 4 people, I'd recommend the 5 cheese selection- $28 that comes with a variety of compotes and jams. For bread, the Garlic knots are amazing, but may not go with every cheese, so get an order of the bread basket, too. 
44 Reviews have already raved on the pizzas, so I won't bore you with detes there. 
The stuffed gnocchi was the perfect texture of chewy, fluffy and light. 
The meat-stuffed olives were a big hit at my table, though I didn't try them. 
Get a lot of wine here. Bottles range in price from $40 to more than 300. But, in the 40-50 range, there are a lot of tasty Italian offerings. 
Crowd was gorgeous, as are the butcher-apron'ed waiters."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place for a girls' night last fall after hearing so much hype about it.  Sadly, it not only fell short of those expectations, it left us all cold. Literally! 

A friend and I ordered the pumpkin ravioli in a cream sauce which arrived at cooler than room temp.  Generally I don't order sweet dishes for dinner so It was especially unappetizing.  I asked if it was meant to be served that way and the server looked confused before offering to warm both of our dishes up.  When they brought it back it still wasn't hot, but was at least warmer.  

My two strars, however, aren't for lukewarm food.  The thing that really turned me off was getting shushed by one of the servers! A table of six women, out on a Friday night in the big city, none of us are particularly shrill, getting shushed! 

We mentioned it to our server and the manager, who sent our table a bottle of dessert wine, but it was too sweet and we weren't drinking that much so only one of us ended up drinking most of it.  It would have been nicer if they had either comped something or not shushed us in the first place. 

I won't go back here."}
{"text":"Updated Review (previous review in Oct 2016).  My partner and I were so impressed with Buca our first time, we chose it as the venue for my parents' 25th Anniversary in May 2017. From the first email to their events organizer (Adrienne) to the moment I paid the final bill, everything was PERFECT. Adrienne was warm, professional, quick to respond, and made great suggestions regarding the menu.  The Chef was even kind enough to tailor the menu to make it a perfect evening for my VERY particular parents.  I was extremely nervous about the food (was afraid our first visit may have been a 1-off) but Buca once again exceeded all expectations.

Not only was the food fantastic (too many dishes to list here) but the staff & service were impeccable. Adreienne, Josephine (our server) and Mario (the sommelier) ensured every detail was taken care of, from the personalized quote on the printed menus to the sparkling wine for the welcome toast, to the parting gift for my parents (pasta kit for them to enjoy at home). They even let me arrive early to place small pots of violets at the table (my mother's wedding bouquet flower).

Our guests couldn't stop raving about the evening (including one guest who is also an Executive Chef!)  This restaurant now has a very special place in my family's hearts."}
{"text":"Buca certainly has cultivated a strong image with the decor and meat curing room, but as with so many other downtown Toronto restaurants, it seems there is a disconnect between the image and the food. 

We had basic appetizers: burrata and the bread knots and the deep fried olives. The burrata was okay, but pretty flavourless and the \"salad\" it was on was lifeless and not visually appealing. The bread knots were good, but mostly because of the olive oil which was the dominant flavour. Hardly something the kitchen dreamed up. The deep fried olives were mediocre. One dimensional and perhaps over fried. None of these dishes made me think \"fresh\" or \"wow\".

We shared a pork pizza which was large and rectangular but looked disgusting. The pork was almost a paste and had only some rosemary to flavour it. Being a blanca pizza there was no sauce to hold things together and the whole thing was a flavourless soppy mess. It was really terrible. 

For dessert we went for a cheese plate with 3 cheeses, soft, medium and hard. The soft was tasteless, the medium was pretty good and the hard was so sharp and crumbly that we couldn't cut it. We ate the crumbs with our fingers. The associated sweet sauces were too sweet and all tasted too syrupy to add anything to the cheeses. 

All in all, this was a very poor meal in a very dolled up space. Considering the great expense ($190 for 2 at lunch with 4 drinks), we were greatly disappointed.

It's possible we chose the wrong things on the menu and there are some better dishes here, but the waiter offered no suggestions and was generally opaque and unhelpful, even with wine or cheese selections.

I think to sum it all up, there is a distinct arrogance here which is reflective in sub-par food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious & great vibe but if you're hungry don't go here. The portions are SMALL! We had 2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, 1 app, and an entree...total was $170. If you're hungry you will spend well over $400 lol."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this is rated one of the top restaurants to dine in Toronto.  I was really disappointed with my total experience at Buca.

Food: 
Salumi di Buca Pizza was average. There was nothing special about the ingredients. The pizza didn't have adequate cheese, sauce or salumi. It was also dry. 

Bigoli pasta (duck egg pasta with duck ragu) - I was so excited for this dish. I was very disappointed in what was served. It was not edible. The pasta was undercooked. I've been to Italy a couple of times. I'm sure the chef was attempting to be more authentic as to not over cook the pasta like most places outside of Italy, but this missed the mark. The sauce lacked flavor as well. Additionally, there were no pieces of duck. I didn't want to waste my calories on bad pasta so I returned the dish to the kitchen.

Cheese and Salumi board - I went with the waiter's selection. I didn't think any of the selected cheeses and meats had any lasting or redeeming qualities. It's hard to mess up cheese, especially because I love CHEESE!!!

Nodini - The warm bread knots were the only good item we had. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. 

Gnocchi di Ricotta - This dish was a better choice for a pasta selection but similar to the other dishes was very small. 

The service was slow, especially since we were there on a Sunday night at 9 pm. 

Overall, I regretted my choice to come here given I only had three nights in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ok if you are looking for modern flair on Italian dishes. Melon with prosciutto was good but the fried gnocchi was boring. The garlic knots were average. The seafood zuppa was fresh but had no traditional Italian ties. Basically fish in broth. Nothing special.  The ricotta and scallop ravioli was odd, again no connection to traditional Italian food. This is NOT a kid friendly place but my kids said the flat bread pizza was good.  There is no kids menu.  We didn't stay for dessert for fear that Italian desserts like tiramisu would be altered to something that was, well, not tiramisu. Nice atmosphere but not for young families with traditional Italian tastes . . .just saying."}
{"text":"Very educated staff, nice relaxing atmosphere and the food, cocktails and wine was beyond amazing. One of the best Italian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Walked here and ate at the bar while working in Toronoto for TIFF 2014. I had a salami platter, the bread knots, and one of the pasta dishes. I had a bourbon cocktail, and a glass of lovely red wine. Maybe it was partly because I didn't have data roaming and thusly couldn't stare at my phone, but I actually sat and enjoyed every bite and sip. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I went there  on wednesday night at 6pm with no reservation. The host gave us a funny look when we said we didnt have a reso. looking around it was dead but 1/2 way through our meal i became aware that it had filled up.
I didnt really like our server he seemed snotty but the food was amazing.
carpaccio-amazing(one of my staple foods)
grilled lamb skewers- amazing
I had the pumpkin pasta with truffle sauce- OMG orgasmic. My partner had the bigolti(first item in pasta menu) it was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I went to Buca last year and thought the food was phenomenal, so I was excited to go back for a birthday dinner recently. I was very disappointed with the food. I ordered the gnocchi which was underwhelming at best. Also the portion was tiny. I ordered some sort of spiced plum pana cotta confection for dessert which was inedible, it tasted like a candle or potpourri. You still need to book reservations three weeks in advance which is surprising considering the inconsistent quality of the food. 
I will say that the service is spectacular (hence the three star rating instead of two) and the nodini bread knots are like crack on a plate, but the entrees are hit and miss and pricing astronomical."}
{"text":"Unreal. I frequent high end restaurants all over the city and I must say this is a gem. I hardly leave positive reviews but the food was so good that it wouldnt be fair not to. The chef and waiter were amazing. Other than the rude little b**ch at the front entrance everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant in Toronto, 100% must if you are here...

I had: 
1- Stuffed strawberry with balsamic 
2- Fried anchovies with parmigiano 
3- Pumpkin pie topped with egg yolk.
4- Prosciutto, parmigiano reggianno and drunken buffala 
5- Carpaccio di manzo 
6- Linguini Nero with pork Ragu and topped with burratta. I think the best pasta ever!"}
{"text":"Came here twice to confirm my initial impression. Joanne Kates is enamoured with the Buca brand, but in this case, I disagree with her assessment. Our city has so much more to offer than Buca, and it's a shame that Buca is the 'golden standard' that foodies from other cities may use to evaluate Toronto against other large cities. The pasta was undercooked (at least a minute or two from al dente), ingredient combinations were bland (e.g. their \"Fiori Di Zucca\" dish), and service was inattentive."}
{"text":"At the epicentre of Toronto's many osteria's lies Buca, the brainchild of the much lauded Executive Chef Rob Gentile. Based in a reclaimed warehouse the ceilings appear to go into the sky, the industrial brick and beam architecture are complimented by a young, buzzing sexy crowd looking to enjoy some outstanding wine, cocktails and shared plates. On any evening this resto can get packed to the you know what - good luck showing up on a Friday or Saturday night without a reso. 

Buca uses traditional Italian ingredients and techniques while fusing them with modern practices and paying homage to old school Italian cuisine. The selection of formaggi and house cured salumi is exceptional. Burro di Buca - pork fat whipped with colonnata spices sourced from local farmers. The Taleggio is a soft cow's milk cheese with a fruity tang, aged for 4 months and is D.O.P which entails that it it is protected and can only come from a specific region of Italy and made in a specific way.    

The ravioli doppi will make you cancel your plans for the following night as you will feel the need to replace them with another visit to Buca. Braised duck, foie gras and goat cheese mousse stuffed raviolis finished with duck crackle, fresh citrus and baby mint. The precision, execution and balancing of flavours at Buca is so strong it may leave you winded. 

The dolce as well as the entire menu is always changing as Chef Gentile and his remarkable culinary team constantly strive to shift the boundaries of your palate. The menu boasts outstanding pizzes served with scissors, comforting meat and seafood dishes, and an array well thought out dishes. Visit Buca for a glass of wine and they will take it from there."}
{"text":"OK finally made it here after having this place bookmarked for eons. The buca bar experience helped expedite this I suppose. I didn't have much time to explore the main menu beforehand so spent a bit of time exploring while seated and waiting for the DC. There were some interesting options but the tasting menu seemed like the best value proposition. Unfortunately they wouldn't sub stuff on the tasting menu so ended up getting the vegetarian tasting with a wine pairing. 
Here goes: 
Fragole: Decent start but didn't wow IMO. 35 year balsamic should have been a stand out but I couldn't find it
Pamodor e Ricotta: just too sweet and would have even passed on as a healthy dessert (whatever that means)
Fromagi: Cheese course hmm another ho hum offering and wine choice was poor IMO sparkling red just didn't go with this course but does it go well with anything?
Gnocchi: Strong cheese with a good wine pairing and brown butter added to the body of this dish. 
Parmigiana Di Melanzane: Very good. I have been liking my egg plant dishes lately and this one fit the bill. Nice combo of tastes and textures (the crispness on the eggplant really stood out IMO) 
Amuse Dessert Granita with yogurt. Didn't have the tang one associates with Granita IMO
Ciambella di Pistachio: Good hefty dessert. Lots of pistachio flavor.
I would say 3.5 overall. Two of the wine pairings were decent while others were just OK to what the! (I guess its very hard to pair wine with vegetables) Service was decent though they need to improve a few things. They should have more lighting in the washroom area as one has to just wander in the dark to find the light switch. The entrance is very hard to spot if you haven't been here before as with construction going on next door one you wouldn't know where to go."}
{"text":"I love Buca.  Italian cuisine is what I've grown up on and have cooked most all my life, consequently I'm always a bit leary of Italian restaurants.   Buca is pretty much a sure thing though.

I always start with various salumi and cheeses which are rich and a meal unto themselves.  The nodini are so tasty timbits have nothing on them (can't go wrong with garlic, sea salt and rosemary...)!  The olives themselves are nothing really out of the ordinary, but I pretty much order olives any chance I get.  

The mains change from time to time, but I've had the sea bream which is my favourite.  Very rich, buttery but the lemon accents it nicely.  The pastas are very good, and even though I'm not a huge pasta guy, I did enjoy the gnocchi.   The polenta main was probably my least favourite.  Horse short ribs and braised lamb's neck were the dominant flavour, they were served overtop of the very well prepared and creamy polenta (just wasn't a fan of the horse and lamb....).   If you can't tell, the starters here are what keep me going back! 

Overall if you love Italian cuisine and want to try some high quality ingredients, Buca is the place for you."}
{"text":"had a great breakfast stop at this little place last time I was in town.  It's very small and they get very busy so get there early or plan to wait a while.  Their specialty coffees are very unique and delicious.  Had some great Italian pastries as well as a delicious egg sandwich.  If you don't speak Italian it's a little tough to figure out what you're ordering but our waitress was friendly, helpful, and patient.  Would love to go back and check out dinner"}
{"text":"When I visited Toronto last week, my friend recommended this place to have some Italian food. We ordered some salami and a tomato pizza to share. Each of us ordered our own main. I ordered a duck pasta as recommended by the waitress. It was very delicious! I was not a fan of pasta but I really liked the duck pasta. I ordered a yogurt dessert and it had an interesting flavor. I tasted my friend's tiramisu and I loved it as well. I really think that you can't really go wrong with anything you ordered here - they are all delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here about a month ago for our anniversary, and it was a really good experience. The sommelier helped us choose a bottle of wine, providing samples of the two he recommended, before we decided on one. Although I had no idea of the price of the bottle, when we got the bill it was a fairly pleasant surprise at $55 - not too overpriced in my opinion. 

The food was excellent, we started with the fried artichokes, then I had the nettle pasta stuffed with mozzarella di bufala and my husband had the bigoli. My pasta was excellent, and a good portion size. My husband loved the bigoli, but wished it had been larger - he said it was so good he could have eaten another one right then. We finished with some type of salted caramel custard which was also excellent. 

Throughout the evening we had excellent service. I would certainly go back, but generally for more celebratory occasions as it is a bit of a higher price point."}
{"text":"bright alley

:King West:

It seems that I am on an 'eat at unidentifiable' restaurant phase. Last Saturday was Bremner (see tomorrow's post) in Montreal and today was Buca. If you're not looking for it, you will miss it. It's next to Cheval. In fact, they share the same alleyway. 

Buca was exactly what I thought it would be.  A clean space with simple details. Special shout out to their light fixture, I loved it.  As those who reviewed before me pointed out, Buca used to be boiler house and you can still see that. It's very industrial with huge ceilings. It's actually basement level but they've opened it up so that a lot of light can shine through. 

The lunch menu was pretty extensive, and priced average for King West. I hear they vary their lunch menu, although there are few constants, such as the rosemary, garlic bread knots.

Service was slow to start, but got stellar and stayed that way throughout our long lunch.  

Olive Ascolane - fried olives stuffed with lamb sausage - crunchy, salty and tangy.

Pizza, sadly, I don't remember what this was called, but it had smoked buffalo cheese, chilies, and the day's cured meats.  It was spicy, salty, and smoky.
 
Bigoli - homemade pasta with duck egg and a duck ragù with mascarpone and basil.  OMG. I loved this dish. The portion is small, but lest we forget, we on King West.  Course if it were a little bigger, I would say I superloved it. 

And of course, dessert:

Pannacotta with kiwi berries. KIWI BERRIES?!?! I Googled it because I've never heard of such a thing, much less tasted such a thing. I had to know more. Their proper term is actinidia arguta, or hard kiwi. Apparently it is native to Korea (amongst other countries). They are really delicious, and I think I love them. 

It was a proper pannacotta. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered it at a restaurant and been served messed up pudding. This was creamy, delicately flavoured and delicious. 

The tart tasted exactly how it smelled - amazing.  Sweet gelati, maple syrup and pistachios added textures to the delicate tart and pumpkin filling.

If I had to choose the best dish of the day, I would go with the bigoli and the pannacotta.  The bread knots are also well-known but I think I want to try the pig ears next time. 

Word of warning, Buca doesn't serve complimentary bread, which may be why people like the knots so much. If you have to pay for bread, why not getting something more creative."}
{"text":"It's widely known that Buca is one of the best Italian restaurants in Canada, so you can definitely expect this little gem to deliver. Expect Italian dishes from all over the country and pay special attention to Sardinian fare. The menu varies slightly from week to week but stays within the confines of traditional Italian menu items. If you've got the cash for it, do it. This is a must-dine for pasta lovers. Caveat: all of the servers have thick Italian accents, which you may find either amusing, irritating or both."}
{"text":"First let me start of saying the food was absolutely delicious (minus the dessert), however, it was the atmosphere and service that compels me to give Buca a 1 star.

When we first arrived, the restaurant was not too busy (out of the two tables beside us, only one was occupied). When we first sat down, my boyfriend and I sat on the same side of the table and read our menu when our waiter rushed over and scolded us - we were told that he had to move to the other side of the table (mind you, there wasn't anyone beside us and there was plenty of room but okay fine). We ordered the warm bread knots and eggplant apps, which were really tasty. 

I had the clam pasta and my boyfriend had the fish - both were very good. For dessert we ordered the panna cotta (was okay). Now this is where things got bizarre.

We didn't finish our dessert and it was gluten-free. My sister from out of town was visiting and she has a gluten sensitivity so I asked them to pack it up. Our waiter then came over and said he couldn't pack the panna cotta. When we asked why, he said that by the time we got home it would be milky and wouldn't be as good...but I insisted that I wanted to take it home. That is when he flat out refused to pack it and I said, it is fine if it isn't as good - we have been warned and we wanted to take the risk. I even told him that we live 5 min away and were taking an uber (even though that should not matter). Still, he absolutely refused. It was incredibly bizarre and in my opinion, extremely rude. 

Although the food was delicious and worth the price, the staff made it an uncomfortable experience. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the service excellent... but portions were just too small in my opinion. I left the restaurant hungry and needed to make a second stop to fill the tank. 

A number of Yelpers noted poor service at Buca but I didn't experience this at all. Our server was good. He answered all our menu questions and made recommendations for their specialty cured meats (on display in the restaurant). 

I like the look of the restaurant, cool modern decor broken into main sections with a large outside patio. Tables were well organized - no overcrowding so you can have a private conversation.  Buca can be hard to find. Just look for the sign on the wall on King St. (just west of Brant, north side of King).  

The food was excellent. We started with two appetizers: 1) The house cured meat platter (3 choices) - Pork Cheek, Wild Boar and spicy Sausage and 2) Nodini - warm bread knots with garlic and olive oil. 

The Nodini was just ok - much harder then I expected. I thought the bread would be melt in your mouth warm & soft but tonight. The cured meat choices were FANTASTIC - easily the highlight of the evening. It's paired with a few different preserves as well. 

For my entree, I ordered the Sea Breeze fish fillet. The fish was top notch, incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly but there was nothing served with it. I thought they were joking at first!  At a $36 price point, I would like some sides? I admit that I have a big appetite but I don't think anyone would be satisfied with this portion.

My companion ordered the Gnudi ($25) - Fresh scallop and Buffalo ricotta dumplings. Also very good.... just melted in your mouth. Portion size also on the small side - more like an appetizer at best.

High praise for the desserts. The blueberry Gelato was the best I ever had ($7) and the Tiramisu ($12) equally good.  

I would likely return but will eat a bigger lunch before my next visit. The Pizza looked incredible and I have to try that (and a good size).

BK"}
{"text":"Disappointing food and overpriced!

The food at Buca did not live up to it's reputation.. maybe I caught them on a bad night..let's start wth the good and then we'll move on to the bad.. 

The Good: The salami selection was good and although it didn't really blow our socks off, I did appreciate they inclusion of the cinghiale (wild boar) salami. The highlight of the evening was the nodini (warm knotted bread tossed in rosemary, sea salt and olive oil).. Honestly, I could have put away a fair few portions of that!

The Bad : We ordered pizza with salami and tortellini with octopus for main course.. The pizza was hot, fresh, decently sized but nothing to write home about.. the octopus tortellini was so fishy I couldn't bear to have more than 2 pieces!  We ended the evening with an espresso, which, to top off the food, verged on the side of bitter. The accompanying biscotti was also dry and a bit stale..

All in all, despite the good service and beautiful ambience, I was sorely disappointed with the food and found it way overpriced!  In fact, I'm on my way to find some sweet potato fries to cheer myself up now..."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try Buca after hearing about it from friends and reading rave reviews. This Italian restaurant in King West is well known amongst the Toronto food scene so be sure to make reservations well in advance, especially for weekend dinners. The ambience was lovely despite the restaurant being situated in the basement, and service was very attentive.

To start, my boyfriend and I ordered their famous nodini (warm bread knots) - this was delicious and we were so glad to have followed our waiter's recommendation to get this. We also shared the salumi di buca which comes with a choice of three cured meats and daily preserves. The cured meats were delicately served on a wooden board and were very tasty.

For our mains, we had the scialatielli alle vongole (hand-cut pasta with clams) and the gnocchi ripieni with cheese and butternut squash. Both dishes were good, but we both particularly enjoyed the vongole and would definitely order this again.

We were too full for dessert by the time we were finished with our entrees, but looking forward to trying some when we're back at Buca!"}
{"text":"Pigs ears, goose stuffed fresh pasta with truffles, authentic tiramisu, decaf latte. Great Monday night spot. Interior is dark, modern, dried meat, nice finishes. Proper coat check with to-go packages dialed in. Open kitchen approach was a bit warm, but great ambiance. Modest pricing options available."}
{"text":"Just had the BEST meal we've ever had.... Fantastic service and food that is out of this world!   If you're in Toronto, Buca has to be a destination.  Our server Gianpaulo was amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian cuisine. The menu is pretty diverse and doesn't shy away from more exotic ingredients like offal - although I was slightly apprehensive to try the duck offal ragu pasta, it ended up being really tasty. The crispy pig ears and bread knots that we got as appetizers were pretty decent as well. Portions were alright but on the smaller side - it's a good idea to order a few appetizers and main courses and share. I also really enjoyed their version of tiramisu; while not the most traditional, it has a nice crunchy element that balances well with the more creamy mascarpone and espresso layers below. 

Service was nice and friendly and I liked the ambiance; although relatively dark, the warm lighting, wine cellar, and meat refrigerator give the whole place a fairly cozy feel, especially since the restaurant is below ground level."}
{"text":"This has been on my list for quite some time and I finally decided to try it for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. I heard it's usually quite difficult to get reservations so I made one for a table of 2 a few weeks before the day we were going to come for dinner.

The location of Buca on King is quite hidden as you have to walk through an alleyway to get into the restaurant. The service from the beginning to the end was quite attentive which is always a plus. They were very helpful when we wanted some menu items explained.

With that being said, we ordered and shared a few dishes:
Bruschetta - whipped buffalo ricotta, figs, raw wildflower, honey, pistachio, preserved lemon 
- This was quite refreshing with an overall balance of sweet and sour from the lemon. 

Bigoli - duck egg pasta, duck ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone, basil
- The portion was smaller than expected for this but the overall flavours were quite rich. You could definitely taste the duck ragu. 

Brasato Misto - tomato braised beef short ribs, cotechino sausage, stone ground polenta, parmigiano, basil
- The short ribs were super tender and broke as soon as you touched it with a fork. It was balanced well with the polenta and sausage. 

We also ordered two glasses of wine along with the meal.

Overall, the meal was enjoyable but it is definitely on the pricier side with smaller portions but authenticity wise, I thought it was pretty good. However, I don't see myself coming back for a while as it seemed like a place I wanted to always just try once."}
{"text":"After reading numerous reviews, I came to two conclusions:  the food at Buca is really good but the portions are really small.  I prepared myself to be hungry after my meal.  Instead, I was full and content at the end.

We started with a board of 4 house-cured meats and one cheese.  Very good.  Had I known one of the cuts was going to be pure fat, I think I would've substituted that one for something leaner.  Very good nonetheless.  Pickled accompaniments were a nice addition.

As our other appetizer, we had the cervello.  These were two small rolls.  The filling was lamb brains, wrapped in deep fried meat (prociutto?).  Some people may have already thrown up a bit in their mouths reading \"lamb brains\" or any brains for that matter, but man, this was delicious!  I could've eaten another order (of two) myself.

Duck pasta was really good.  The portion looks small but after eating half, you realize the ragout is quite heavy and filling.  

We also shared the red (tomato sauce) pizza with burrata and truffles.  This pizza was amazing!  The crust was perfection.  

For dessert, we shared a tiramisu.  I'm not a dessert person so it was just ok to me.

Service was very good throughout the evening.  However, we just had to wait a little longer for dessert and then we had to wait even longer to get the bill.  

One thing that bothered us was the temperature in the restaurant.  There was a bit of a draft making it kind of cool, and as a result, our food got cold really fast.  I'm sure it's hard to regulate the thermostat in a converted warehouse-type structure, especially when it's in the basement too.  

All in all, it was a lovely meal for my anniversary.  I would still recommend this place even with the few minor setbacks."}
{"text":"To me this place was ok. 

Ambiance is trendy, classy and warm. This place is not so big so be sure to reserve a table if your popping in for a meal. 

They are obsessed with ducks, they even have ducks hanging as a display.   Quack quack !!! 

We all got different meals and everything was delicious. Chef did wonders with the food. Loved the food.  But I found the portions to be small. 

We got the garlic knots, sea bass and spaghetti. 

So something weird happened. My friend ordered water for the table, she specifically asked for 'ice water' 

The waiter brought us natural spring water.  And ice on the side.   All night the waiter was refilling our water glasses.   I was like, wow this bottle is not finishing.  But little our knowledge.....he filled the glasses with three rounds of bottles....in the end we bought three bottles and didn't even realize.  We didn't order natural spring water but he should have asked us if we wanted more bottles of this expensive water.  I would have been fine with tap water.   Maybe there was some miscommunication at first but I thought this was a little sketchy on this part to not ask after the second and third time!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great my only negative comment would be charging $55 for a bottle of wine that you can buy for $14.95 at the LCBO grrr."}
{"text":"Went to Buca tonight for the first time.  Now my Saint-Jacobs-Buca trifecta is complete. It didn't disappoint as the final instalment.

Loved the ambience and the space.  Really gorgeous.  They had the door wide open, and a great breeze was blowing in.  As with all three restaurants, service was well-informed, efficient, friendly.....excellent.  No women servers here, all real-Italian men :)

We shared everything which I think is always the way to do.  We had the tuna and the soft shell crab to start.  Both were good, but we agreed it was the weakest course (we had a three course meal).   Second out was the nodini (GET THEM) and the vela heart tartar, which was really interesting and flavourful.  Then we split two pastas, both excellent - one was a duck one and the other was pork blood.  I hate spicy food, but the pork blood pasta had a perfect, delicate undernote of spice.  Tiramisu to finish, gotta share just one dessert because all those carbs fill you up.

Would be back, great for special occasions and romantic dinners."}
{"text":"I came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and I was surprised how not so good this place was. I scavenged the realms of the Internet to find a perfect Italian spot in Toronto, and I was kind of really disappointed. 

The ambience was ALRIGHT, the food was ALRIGHT and the service was just NOT GOOD. The only saving grace was that they (the executive chef???) were kind and gave my boyfriend a special present for his birthday (unexpected), but other than that, DAMN, not worth. The final bill came out to be almost 200 dollars. 

We made reservations for 9. We probably got there 3-5 minutes before 9, but we still ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for a table at the bar. (How??) 

When we finally got seated around 9:30, the two of us ordered:
1. Orecchio di maiale  (pig ears)
2. Nodini (warm bread knots)
3. Funghi pizza
4. Gnocchi ripieni 
5. Sopresini alle vongole??? I cannot remember (All pictures are attached)
6. Tiramisu 

The pig ears were delicious but damn, they were salty AF. So were the bread knots (which I thought would be soft and pillowy, but they were REALLY hard). I think my lips started to burn after a while. 

The pizza was OKAY, the mushrooms tasted amazing (I love mushrooms), but everything else in the pizza was just OKAY. 

I'm fine with OKAY, you know, if the food is OKAY, then it's not bad, which means the restaurant is coming-back-able.

Then came our pasta dishes! 

Everyone supposedly loves al dente pasta, but I don't. I like my noods to be a little bit softer, but you know what, I'll eat al dente if I have to. I took a bite of my pasta, and it was REALLY al dente. I wasn't sure if I was delusional so I took another bite, and again, VERY al dente. But there was no way they could undercook my dish! It was a birthday event and I didn't want to send a dish back! But I asked my boyfriend to try a bite of my pasta and he confirmed that the pasta I was eating was INDEED CRUNCHY and I should send it back because it was quite inedible. 

We proceeded to tell one of the waitresses, who was just standing there and doing nothing. She came over and we both explained that the dish was undercooked and that it was hard and crunchy. I don't think she understood a single thing we said because she left and never came back. Nothing happened for the next five minutes, no one took my plate away, so we tried to wave at her, but she just looked away, like she didn't see two people trying to get her attention in the most polite way possible.  And then I never saw her again! I don't know, did she hide in the bathroom? 

We proceeded to tell someone else and he kindly took my dish away (and my boyfriend's dish) and said the chefs will cook the pasta dishes for us again. After a bit, he brought us back NEW dishes and we ate it, and I'm glad to say that this time, the pasta was NOT crunchy and it was al dente at its finest. 

We ordered tiramisu (which was crazy heavy and my BF LOVED IT) after our pasta dishes and our night ended when the executive chef brought my BF a special present. 

Honestly, if it wasn't for that dreadful experience with the waitress who ignored us completely, I would have given this place 3 stars! It's not like we were howling and screaming and crying for disgusting crunchy pasta. We told her politely that the dish was undercooked and she blinked once and that was all the interaction we got from her.  

TLDR; Be aware of waitresses that pretend you don't exist and crunchy pasta. Come at your own risk."}
{"text":"this is my absolutely favourite in the city at the moment. their food is amazing and the restaurant is beautiful.  I went with a big group of people so I got to try a little bit of everything. We ordered the pig's ears, eel, gnocco fritto and a bunch of other small plates to share. For main I had the polenta with 3 different kinds of meat and their gnocci (the gnocci was TO DIE FOR). 

I have gone back with a friend of mine and was treated to a glass of wine because we didn't have a reservation and we were asked to wait around 5-10 minutes at the bar (amazing!)
This place is always busy and bustling but always very well run and lively. It's exactly what I look for in a dining experience. 
Everytime someone asks for a restaurant suggestion, Buca is always the first I mention."}
{"text":"CIndy C. has it down. My first time at Buca was lovely. It started off a bit awkward. When you arrive, it seems as though you've stumbled into through a back entrance.  The hostess \"desk\" is a floor mat, and I guess you're just supposed to wait to be greeted. That didn't really happen. We had to notify about 3 people that we were waiting to be seated before the hostess came and she wasnt very welcoming or friendly. I guess it was a busy night. 

After that however, it was a really great experience. I didn't know what to expect, and wondered if I had crashed a corporate party. ALL the patrons were dressed very well, and far from business casual...more like cocktail attire. 

As we waited for our table to be ready, we drank at the bar. I didn't drink alcohol that night, and when the bartender realized I was the only one in my party not drinking, he made me a homemade iced tea on the house. It was really refreshing. 

When we sat down, I have to admit, the tables were too close to each other' and the place was more so packed with employees walking around, crowding the floor. But the atmosphere is fabulous. The food is tasty and the great thing is that the menu is never more than (I think) two weeks old....if I remember what we were told. Its a great way to try new items on each visit. 

Its impressive and comfortable for the most part."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in Toronto and would go up against some top restaurants across the east coast. Eggplant parm, king crab / caviar pasta, asparagus with cheese sauce and spot prawn crudo were out of this world. Cauliflower stuffed pasta, garlic knots and artichoke / potato pizza were somewhat pedestrian compared to the other food but probably would have been standouts if the other food wasn't so impressive. Will be in the rotation every trip here"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Toronto! Actually best meal I've had all month!

The lovely Kat F and I walked in on Thursday night without a reservation.They were quite packed, but were able to find a table for us. It was located right next to the restroom, which is a bonus for any pregnant woman!

We started with their bread, which should probably be complimentary because no one should miss out on this garlicy dough goodness! 

As for my entree I went with their homemade pesto gnocchi, which literally melted in my mouth. Kat ordered a very generous sized pizza, which she was nice enough to share with me...very tasty as well! The table of men next to us had food envy just watching us eat it and ordered a pizza of their very own. 

I was full enough to stop here, but had a feeling dessert would be as fantastic as the rest of the meal. And I was right! I felt a bit guilty enjoying the best tiramisu ever, mostly because it's my hubby's favorite dessert.  Kat went the healthier route with mango sorbet, which was refreshing (and tasty)!

I've been dreaming about this meal ever since and the first thing I'll do when booking my next trip to Toronto is to make a reservation here at Buca!"}
{"text":"We love going to this place! The food is great and the wine is awesome! The pasta and the pizza are really good."}
{"text":"I went to Buca the other night. The food is AMAZING. I don't even really like Italian food, and I am BIG FAN of Buca. 

Here's why Buca is Amazing:
- Interesting dishes, like the ravioli that is half squash and half duck (I think.) A perfect blend of flavours. 
- Wonderfully light, thin crusted pizza
-Spagetti that even a person who never orders spaghetti (me) had seconds of. 

The ambience is perfect. Dimly lit, quiet open kitchen, brick walls. 

Here's why this isn't a five star review:
-Our table was right by the door and it was cold every time somebody came in. Buca could use a wind blocking curtain. 
-Our server seemed a bit new. She was very nice, but wasn't confident in her knowledge of the menu and wine list.
- The menu is very complicated to order from.

I recommend Buca to anyone who's in to food. But I suggest you request a table away from the door."}
{"text":"It's Been awhile, Buca. Why haven't I been back sooner? To be honest, it's the attitude on King St. Although I found the food and service to be excellent both times prior, I avoid the King St. corridor because of its somewhat douchey vibes.

Buca still has good food, but the ennui we experienced on the part of almost all the staff except for our server, was staggeringly inhospitable and bordering on rude. We arrived and the hostess was more like a miniature undertaker than a person who is responsible for first impressions. She checked for our reservation without a smile and devoid of any sign of humanity. She informed us our table wasn't ready, and that we could wait on the bench. My friend and I waited for about 10 minutes and another reservation for 2 at 8:30 arrived. They, too, had to wait for their table in the hall. However, the hostess asked them if they wanted to wait in the bar and have a drink. If we could have gone there 10 minutes ago, why were we waiting in a temporary entrance hallway with all the charm of a holding room for human cargo? So we approached the hostess and asked to wait in the bar. 
She took us there, again, without a smile and both of us were definitely not feeling very welcome or happy to be there. We thought a drink might cure this. We were approached by a very stiff sommelier who recommended a new cocktail, which I agreed to. My friend needed a moment and he seemed completely irritated by this. We also picked a wine for dinner ahead of time. We were very good customers. You think he would have smiled or been friendly or gracious. He was like a dark cloud that we didn't want to return. And I always want someone who has wine to return!!!

I think that food and warmth go hand in hand. Even most of the waiters who served me in France were more gregarious than these two members of staff we first encountered. Major douchey attitude.

Our server was thankfully, very nice. She was sweet, smart, coursed our food out well for us and deserved her tip. I don't need someone to be fake or irritating, but at least be someone that doesn't make me wince each time you come to the table.

Olives and bread knots were nice. Pig's Ears were delicious and crispy. The gnocchi with fiddleheads were like soft carb clouds and the pizza with mushrooms and Gorgonzola was thin, crisp and offered a perfect splay of cheese and toppings with each bite.

Our food was great, but what's with pretentious, surly people who greet you? The food doesn't taste as good when you're around unhappiness. You don't make yourself more attractive to customers by frowning and acting like you couldn't care less. And you don't have to be stiff as a board to be professional. What I loved about Alo, was that the service staff were not canned-- they were real and displayed traits of their personality. But they were knowledgeable and happy to help. To be fair, perhaps management is poor and that's why the staff were unhappy. People often have reasons for not smiling. So if poor management is an issue here, it should be addressed and perhaps the staff will treat the guests better.

With all the other Italian places in the city, I probably won't come back to Buca again. The food was good, but the hospitality, with the exception of our server, was quite sour.

With the lack of warmth, I'm surprised the food gets cooked!"}
{"text":"This is our first stop after we landed in Toronto. We were so looking forward to it, but it ended with major disappointment!

We had a lunch reservation.  When my husband asked about what we \"have to try\" since this is our first time, the waiter pointed at the menu and said \"everything is on the menu and it's all in English!\" I clarified that we are looking for suggestions, then he said \"what do you like to try?\" I said: \" we like to try everything.\" Then he said \"that will be ton of food!\" His tone is very condescending. Finally, he pointed most expensive choices on the menu as suggestions. We didn't mind paying for good choices, so went ahead with sashimi sea bass and five other items on he menu.

We all thought the bread balls were seasoned nicely but texture wasn't light enough. Sashimi was really tasty. Pizza choice was excellent, liked the light tomato seasoning and fluffy cheese on the top!

Then we waited good 25 minutes for our last dish Risotto. We asked gently when the dish will come, the waiter showed up in 5 minutes and said it takes long time to prepare this dish! We were shocked by this response! All we are looking for is an honest \"we will ask the chef\" response, an excuse like this is just so pretentious!

Overall, we like the atmosphere and food quality, but very disappointed at the service. This is not a pleasant employee and his attitude brings stains to Buca's reputation."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by this place for lunch in an effort to avoid the crowd.  Buca has gained quite the notoriety now with it's 3rd location opening up in Yorkville.

Started off with the recommended salumi board.  This is in-house cured salumi from my understanding, and came with a selection of pickled vegetables and cheese.  Also, you can add warm olives and bread knots on the size.  A great sharing app for a party.  The salumi is excellent - you get three types, and generous cuts of cheese.  The bread knots are ridiculously addictive - crisp on the outside and drenched in olive oil and italian herbs.

For my main I had the bigoli with duck ragu.  Pasta was cooked nicely - al dente.  The duck ragu was delicious and not too saucy or salty.  They also have a gluten free option for any of their pastas.  My colleague had the burrata pomodoro pizza.  This was easily the star of our entrees.  The burrata was decadent and runny and the crust was cooked to perfection - perfectly crisp.  I have been to a fair share of pizza spots and was very impressed considering the other options on their menu.

Cocktails were meh.  I had the manhattan siciliano... which tasted pretty much like an average manhattan but boozer.  Service was OK and decor is kind of neat.  The restraurant is hidden in the back of a building in the basement.  A good amount of light still gets in during the day.  I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for a nice big Italian, family style dinner!

{"text":"This place didn't do it for me. Yes, the staff are very knowledgeable and passionate about the food, but I wasn't really impressed by the food.

The Bigoli (duck egg pasta with duck ragu) was the biggest joke. At $21, you get what looks like three bites of pasta. 

The Sanguinaccio (pork blood brownie), $12, was interesting, but it was a little gross to eat; not because it was blood, but because it tasted like blood. It was fun though because they lit it on fire.

The Cervello (lamb brain wrapped in bacon), $9, was probably my favourite thing next to the pizza, but I'm discounting the pizza because pizza is so ordinary. The brain texture was really mushy and off-putting, but the bacon definitely saved it. 

And finally, the proscuitto pizza ($24) tasted perfectly fine. As pizza is kind of easy to make and ordinary, my only complaint is that it is about 100% overpriced. 

In general, this place was too expensive for the taste. I didn't find anything spectacular and I feel like the use of unconventional ingredients (lamb brain, pork blood) for excitement is a cop-out; other types of cuisines use them on a daily basis for better tasting dishes at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"There are better places to eat in King West than Buca. Head to Gusto instead."}
{"text":"Tucked away down a dark alley off King, this is a great place to take your New York friends out for dinner, if you want them to think that you \"know\" places.

Decor is lovely, drinks are lovely, service is fabulous and food is amazing.
I'll agree with the other reviewers when I say the garlic rosemary knots were soooo delicious.  The pizza was excellent...real cheese, cured meat and tangy sauce.  And scissors to cut with.  Scissors!!!

I had the gnocchi with pesto, and it was clear that it was made fresh in-house, as it thankfully lacked the rubbery texture most gnocchi has at other places.

We also had the daily cheese selection which was freaking amazing.  We sampled 3 different cheeses, served with 3 tapenades.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, and helped us select the most amazing cheeses flown in fresh that day.

Dessert was ok.  We had the doughnuts - one was filled with an apple sauce-like filling, and the other was a caramel custard.  I say it was only ok, as it did taste just like apple sauce, and the custard had a bit of a disarming chemical-y flavour.

The service here is excellent, and the employees really know their menu and are very helpful with recommendations.  Would definitely go back, but a $200 meal is best for a special occasion only!"}
{"text":"Came here for a small birthday celebration with my girlfriends, I came early that day and was taken to the table to be seated while I wait for my friends. Was given a glass of complimentary champagne while I wait which was really neat and beyond my expectation. The food were all really good too but I have to admit they were all very small portions and quite pricey given the size of the dish. But flavors were all there, especially the Ravioli Doppi which was divine, I only got one bite since it was what my friend ordered but it was the most memorable dish for the night. 

I would visit again, perhaps on a day when I am least hungry!"}
{"text":"*Buca's chocolate hazelnut version of Zuccotto*

I could have just written about this cake in a short tip, but nope, I chose to dedicate a whole review to this thing. I'm cool like dat. 

Yes, we all know that Buca, Bar Buca and Buca Osteria Enoteca (opening soon in Yorkville) are solid, but do you specifically know about this stunning cake on their dessert menu? Probably not. I think that people tend to go for the other insanely good and more popular options and skip over this traditional Florentine cake option.

My admittedly shoddy photo was initially of my cute work friends, but for the purpose of this review, I have lovingly cropped them out of the shot and we are left with the blurry, zoomed-in, dome-shaped zuccotto. As a point of interest, the zuccotto is said to be shaped this way to resemble the dome of Florence's Duomo.

When I was in Florence for the first time, I climbed the stairs to get to the top of the Duomo and was stunned by the view of the city. You will reach a similar kind of bliss when you share this dessert. 

The price of the zuccotto ($26) is also like the climb to the top of the Duomo: a bit steep.The menu does state that this serves two though, and with elements of Gianduja, chocolate, Frangelica and cream, it could easily serve 3 or 4 people (or just one person, depending on your mood). You can also tell that a lot of care has gone into constructing the cake. 

It's a dreamy dessert combining a cakey top half soaked in Frangelica, a chocolate mousse filling, a gianduja cookie base (we only realized this after we had finished the rest of the cake - best surprise!) and a cream sauce poured over the top... Ciao bella zuccotto!"}
{"text":"Buca has a quaint beautiful patio tucked away from the main street that makes you feel like you're in some alleyway in Europe. The atmosphere is beautiful and the service is attentive.

I went with some friends that ordered various pasta dishes and we got a wide array in portion size. I ordered the duck egg pasta ($21) that looked small at first but it turned out to be a decent portion. The cream and egg yolk sauce made it quite filling as well. The pasta was chewy and the sauce was delicious. 

However, my friends that ordered the tortellini and raviolo did not receive that big of a portion. One piece of pasta for $24 is quite pricey, despite the fact that they got the yolk to ooze out when you cut into the pasta. Even though Buca uses the freshest ingredients, it can become an expensive meal if you want to get full (depending on what you order). 

Overall, Buca is a great place to go if you're looking for elevated culinary skills that showcase fine ingredients! I will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the lovely Buca on the weekend and had a wonderful time! Our waiter was so informative - about all of the items on the menu and when we asked for him to recommend a wine, he wanted to know what we were selecting to eat so he could make an informed choice for us. He was spot on. The sardines, nodini, pomodoro, gnocchi, duck egg pasta with duck ragu - all lovely. The only reason I didn't rate Buca 5 stars is because the portions were a little small....but I say that mainly because I didn't want to share what I had because it was so delicious. We finished the evening with espresso (a touch cold for our taste) and an UNBELIEVABLE chocolate grappa. I am telling you it was DELICIOUS - and contrary to how it sounds it does not have that \"throat on fire\" grappa taste most think grappa has, but a chocolate indulgent amazing smooth liqueur-like texture. 

We ate outside on the patio which was really beautiful and tucked down the alley next to Cheval. And they don't jam you one on top of another.  In fact I overheard our waiter tell another table that they are licenced to have more tables than they have on the patio in the interest maintaining more space. 

We did have a cocktail before dinner inside the restaurant. A very cool atmosphere that would be great for a night out with a group or on a date but isn't \"typically\" romantic. All in all, I would definitely recommend going to Buca - in fact, I already have!"}
{"text":"Great service and meal - we wernt sure on what wine we wanted and the waiter brought multiple samples to help decide.

All the dishes were delicious - the blood pasta DID taste a little like chinese take out ( ground meat and hot chillis )"}
{"text":"Buca means hole in Italian. By no means is this place a hole. Grace our server greeted us warmly and was so impressive explaining the menu while maintaining a professional demeanour. 

We decided on the delicious Nodini (bread knots) with Piselli e Lardo (puffy pastry with pork fat) which was absolutely smooth and lovely. For mains we chose the Bigoli and Raviolo All'Uovo both were exquisitely prepared and looked fantastic when they came out. My favourite was the duck egg pasta as it was cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce was better than any meat sauce that I've ever tried. The hand made hand shaped tortellini was so divine with the ricotta blending so nicely with the speck and sauce underneath the dish. 

Cocktail, wine and beer pairing were done effortlessly by our server and if I could possibility get that wine (Grabay?) again I would but it is a special order just for the restaurant. 
Desserts were different and non-traditional, especially the Tiramisu. The Limoncello tasted smooth and sweet with a nice balance of fruit and cake. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like adventure, trying new tastes and who enjoys food prepared with love and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is my colleagueas favorite dining spot and she said it is her must go when she visits home. So I called to make a reservation for a group of 12 for a team dinner. BUCA team was responsive and said they can only accommodate one large group of up to 12. When I got to the restaurant, the place was pretty empty and there was another large table. So I didn't really understand their rationale.

We ordered wine, garlic knots, pizza, cheese and meat board,.Pasta and fish. Everything was good but not awesome or 4 star worthy. The burrata pizza was good with generous burrata. But the mushroom pizza was dying for some mushroom. It was like eating a pizza with white sauce and every other piece got a little flavor of mushroom. Pretty disappointing.

The pasta was even more of a disappointment. It came out lukewarm and not piping hot. Let's just say we didn't order a lot of food and there was still a lot left. Not super blown away by this place and think Scrapetta and Babbo in NY is wayyy better.

Service was ok. But I felt pressured by waitress to order a lot. I guess she knew portions were smaller than average places and we needed more food."}
{"text":"This was heaven!  The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeble, attentive and clairvoyent.  The Pomodoro was excellent.  Not a bad dish in the bunch. So much better than the high flying 54th floor  double ender with a higher raing that we ate at two nights before."}
{"text":"5 stars for food and service (lots of hot men serving tables ;) ). Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine selection (wine list is extensive...almost too overwhelming and it took us a long time to decide on a wine). Of the few dishes Of food I had, I was very satisfied and want to come back for their tasting menu. It was too bad the whole table had to participate in the tasting menu (so make sure u get a full group willing to participate!). The tortellini was hand crafted so meticulously the presentation was beautiful and taste was excellent (albeit I only had a bite from my friend's meal...it's on the tasting menu so i look forward to having it again!). I had the warm knot bread to start and would recommend it. I had the Polpo pizza and really enjoyed it...never had braised octopus on pizza before and I really like how the amount of toppings were just right and the various ingredients used blended so well. cant remember name of dessert I had but it was a satisfying ending...custard on a thin biscuit with oranges on top (first one off their current dessert menu). Overall, the impression I have is that every dish is very unique, detailed and there is a lot of variety in terms of meat selection and assortment by category (pizza, pasta). I'm intrigued about the unique dishes that incorporate non traditional ingredients such as pork blood and lamb brains! Only thing is, the vocabulary on the menu was hard to follow ...I think many words were in Italian or some fancy ingredient I've never heard of."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a large party for dinner, so was able to try several items off the menu. I wasn't blown away by the food. I don't think this place lives up to the hype.

First off, before discussing the food, I want to note that I found a hair in my rainbow trout (which I know was definitely not my own). Another person in our group also found a hair in her food. This was quite off-putting.

Onto the food - I really enjoyed the appetizers, but the mains and desserts didn't impress me much. For the appetizers, the branzino (thinly sliced raw fish) was great. Nice texture, with tastes of lemon and olive oil. the deep fried seafood was also really nice. The seafood tasted really fresh. Charcuterie, squid pockets and oysters were good too.

For the mains, we tried duck yolk and black truffle pizza. I found the pizza to be too crispy and some parts were burnt. We tried two different pastas (one with tomato sauce and the other with duck in it), and while I enjoyed the texture of the pasta (you can tell its freshly made), I wasn't overly excited about the flavour of the sauces. The rainbow trout was very nicely done and prepared. They open it in front of you - it's covered in salt, basil and thyme (I think) and slowly cooked at a very slow temp. Side of green beans were good and flavourful. The zuchinni side was quite sour.

Desserts - the panna cotta was the hit at our table. Light and fluffy with sorbet underneath. Very nice light dessert. The olive oil cake was too dry and grainy. The semifreddo was really chocolaty and alcohol-y (which could be a good thing if that's what you're after!). Tiramisu was too dense/creamy for my liking."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner, seated promptly for a 5:30 pm reservation on a Friday night on the patio. While the service was impeccable (food ordering was meticulous and server repeatedly informed us that everything had to be ordered in one go), the food itself left something to be desired.

We were encouraged to share all our plates for a party of six. Started with ordering prosecco (70 per bottle), and while good, a little steep for my non-wine connoisseur taste. The appetizers were served first - pig ears (favourite!! Chips-like crunch and did not taste foreign at all), porcini salad (underwhelming) and house favourite nodini (bite size bread knots in Rosemary garlic olive oil, too salty for my liking but a hit with most of our party). Also ordered a two meats one cheese board (portions were tiny and neither the crotenese cheese nor goose breast/wild boar sausage were flavourful).

For mains we split the duck ragu pasta (portion is tiny!) and two pizzas - sopressata and finotecchia. The pizzas were the highlight of the evening, perfectly baked, thin crust, sufficient portion size for once and the spicy sausage was heavenly after other tasteless meats... Which leads me to the other two 'carne' mains shared, the steak and sausage. They were not flavoured well, and the sausage had a funky aftertaste. We found out after that there were sauces that were not decorative but meant to be dipped like radicchio butter... Oops.

Lastly we wrapped up with some dessert. The party was fairly stuffed by this point so we opted to share a pork blood (yes you read that correctly) and chocolate tart. The pork blood taste was definitely faint so even the faint of heart can try but this did not impress. It was served fridge cold and was again lacking flavour. 

Overall the food itself was underwhelming, there was an overarching flavour and portion size issue, and the some of the servers had heavy accents which made it difficult for us to understand the food consumed. For a bill of 400 altogether, Buca did not deliver. I will save my next trip for its awesome sister on Portland, Bar Buca instead."}
{"text":"Got noddini and parmagiana di melanze, both were incredible! Exceeded my expectations of how good Italian food can even be (which is insanely high)!! The wait staff aws extremely knowledgable and kind, the food was so fresh and delicious! Haven't stopped talking about it since I ate! An absolute most-try!"}
{"text":"Went here for family style dinning with a group of 10 people.  The food is delicious - pizza's / bread knots / fish / appetizers / etc.  All get 4 / 5 rating.  But ordering family style becomes super expensive, is confusing, and generally not a fun experience with a large group of people.  There should just be a prix fix for family style with less options.  Everything is charged individually so we racked up quite the bill! Also did not need to hear the waiter go through the entire menu telling us what he would order - that's fine if we ask, but not into you telling us what you would order for each section - we can read we'll be fine. 

A little dark and very loud - but some people are into that.  Wouldn't rush back there for the atmosphere - maybe the food.  Also - FYI - don't give patrons bad looks when they are waiting in the hallway to get their coats.  If you didn't want them to stand in the hallway why is the coat check there?"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the funnest meals I've ever experienced in Toronto.  This place is swank as hell but casual enough that you don't feel out of place if you're slumming it in jeans and a t-shirt.  Let the rich yuppies look all dolled up and sexy, I'm here to EAT.

The second you get in there's a whirlwind of chaos as it was quite packed and people are standing near the bar waiting for their tables.  As we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we were offered champagne and apps at the bar.  Sure it took 15 minutes for the bartender to notice us but it was so busy that I guess that was to be expected.  What arrived were deep fried pig ears (nice and fatty), some garlic pastry balls (kinda bland and boring) and some really nice beef stuffed olives.

When we where finally seated, our waitress was super friendly and you could tell she was genuinely excited about the food.   We had heard that Buca had the best pasta in town so we were equally excited to try everything, or at least die trying.

We started with an assortment of chacuterie which was pretty fun to pick at and was all pretty damn tasty all around, but did not prepare me for what was coming next.  

Not often am I completely BLOWN AWAY by a dish, but my god my life has not been the same since.  For a measly $58 you can get a pizza so incredible you will never enjoy another slice of anything in your life.  The Bianca Truffle was absolutely delicious with a beautifully light but crispy crust, earthy goodness truffle flavorings accompanied by raw egg yolk brushed across the surface of tellegio cheese.  My lower half is tingling just thinking about it. 

Anyways, our mains came and between the Carbonara, the Polenta, award winning Duck egg pasta and some sweet dish I don't remember, I would have to say that Buca is serious about their food and it freaking shows.

After that, we ordered a cheese plate along with some dessert and my stomach was about ready to explode.  Alas I regret nothing and would do it again given the opportunity. 

My only gripe with the place is they charged us for the apps at the bar while we were waiting, but never really asked us if we wanted any.   The way they spoke, it seemed as though the offered it to everyone while they waited, but I guess you don't  accumulate a $700 bill on giving out free food.

Go eat that pizza."}
{"text":"Biggest rip off ever! Nothing is special with their food. They are trying too hard, having waitresses describe your food with italian accent is not enough! Showbusiness..."}
{"text":"Came here with my family while we were in Toronto. It was tough to find the place, but the struggle was well worth it. I had one of my best meals i had while. I recommend all who read this to check this place out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and went for dinner here for the first time November 2014. We did not know what to expect but we were quickly seated.

The service was perfect. We did not have to wait to have our drink then food Orders taken. The food came out of the kitchen very quickly. My GF started with Ontario beans which were delicious. I had the beef carpaccio and the burrata was the tastiest I've ever had. For the main course, the waiter recommended I have the pig blood pasta which was exceptional. My simple girlfriend got the spaghetti pomodoro but it couldn't have been any better. The portions are relatively small but it is fine dining so you can't expect giant portions, regardless we were full and satisfied afterwards. We finished off the night with the florentine cake for two which was delicious.

Overall I would say that the food is slightly overpriced but still worth it and I would return. 4.5/5 would highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a real Italiano Experience!  From the waiters, the servers to the General Manager Marco, they know how to show 2 girls a real Italian Experience!

The restaurant was clearly packed and we were treated like royalty.  Don't get me wrong, it was pricey, but was worth the experience we had.

I can't even find what we ordered to suggest - but we had fresh BUFFALO MOZZARELLA, which was kneaded and placed in ice water - topped with a few different toppings of your choice, the taste was fresh and divine.  Watich the hot water knead my mozzarella wasn't bad either.

That's all I really remember, but great food, great service and great ambiance - would totally recommend for a VERY special occasion!"}
{"text":"Have never actually eaten here.  I had a reservation for this evening and after number of attempts to cancel no one answered the phone.  They called to see if I was still coming and after hearing the attitude of the gentleman that called me I have no desire to give them my money or time. L'unita and Sotto Sotto are amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto and know how to treat a patron. There are so many great restaurants in this city with amazing food and service, it's a a shame when an establishment in the service industry don't understand the importance of customer service."}
{"text":"As amazing as the food was, $18 for 3 scoops of gelato?? I can bring the Pope in town to bless any gelato I want."}
{"text":"My favorite part of the meal was the broccoli which was as light as air... because our server forgot to bring it over.
I am a huge fan of Bar Buca but found this place really off putting. Both of our servers were just...crappy. Our main server seemed to have a language barrier and took wine glasses away when we told her we werent finished, plates away when we were still eating. The guy who brought our wine was serving it old som style and boasted \"its the only way its to be done\" but didnt even do it properly? It was such a confusing experience. 
This isnt the restaurants fault but my table of three other 20 somethings kept getting death glares from the middle aged people in the room. Whats that about?
Our pizzas were waiting for a while at the pass and were on the colder side when they came to the table. Nobody in the kitchen looked like they were having any fun :("}
{"text":"I wish I could say better things about Buca because it was hyped up to me so much. We had to book way in advanced which is totally reasonable, however we were shoved in a weird group area that felt so disconnected with the actual restaurant. The lighting was quite bright which certainly took away from the \"romantic\" feeling on a romantic dinner out. 

We ordered quite a bit of food with the anticipation of it being staged. This was not the case. All of our starters came out at exactly the same time. Four items on the table at once. We felt rushed to say the very least. I can't say that anything we had really stood out which is disappointing. 

Drinks were pretty boring. I hate to say the highlight was the cookie they bring you with the bill. Sadly, I doubt we'll be returning when they're SO many other Italian restaurants that are way more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Minus waiting a bit for our reservations everything was superb.

- apps were so tasty (mini meatballs & bread knots)
- I had the lasagnette as an entree and it was the perfect portion size and whatever meat was in there was to die
- I ordered a little bubbly and they gave a generous pour which I can and will always appreciate. 

I'll definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"The menu has wird selections. It doesn't seem at all the italian food that i am used to eating. 
When i go in a restaurant i like to enjoy the environment but this place makes you feel you are in a basement. It is really expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I find myself frequenting Buca whenever I'm in the mood for Italian.

My favourite things to get here are the Crispy pig ears, Bigoli duck egg/ragu pasta and the Pomodoro Tartufo pizza.

The pig ears are crisp and salty. While the portion is on the smaller side, the Bigoli duck pasta is cooked perfectly al dente and the ragu has so much flavour and depth to it. And my absolute favourite dish is the Pomodoro Tartugo pizza. The ingredients are simple but everything comes together so well - the crust is crisp, the burrata cheese is light and runny, and the shaved truffle/truffle oil tops off the entire thing.

Along with great ambiance/decor and impeccable service, it easily makes Buca my go-to restaurant for date night or really any occasion."}
{"text":"To preface my review, I was there sometime last fall, and looking back at photos, I remembered the awesome experience. I want to go there again !!

On a cold Saturday night, we visited the restaurant.  Hidden behind in the alleyway, a glass door invites you to go downstairs.  I loved the high ceilings, and the seemingly busy atmosphere.

The menu had so much variety. Although a little hard to read, unless you're familiar with Italian phrasing, and in addition to the dim lights, the appetizers are on the right, and the cured meats (in house) and cheeses to the left. It seems like the menu changes on a a regular basis, so i'm excited to try this place in the future.

2 room in the restaurant, one with a very high ceiling, with exposed bricks, give a really rustic feel. A smaller room at the back for more intimate dining, I guess.

They cure their own meats in a back room near the smaller dining room. you can choose 3 or 5 different types $15/25. It includes pork, lamb, and other delicacies.

We spent forever deciding. The Waiters were patient and VERY knowledgeable about the food.

From the appetizers we ordered the \"garlic balls\", or more officially, the Bread Knots or Nodini.
Crisp on the outside, tender on the side, infused with garlic, butter and sea salt. 

We also ordered the Crispy Artichokes. I'm not a fan of Artichokes, but it was yummy. But just an Artichoke tempura.

We shared 4 mains among 4 girls.  The portions weren't huge, but too small to share! I wanted my own!!!

The Cervello Lamb sweet bread was SO flavourful and tender. Not sure what it was covered by, I believe a cured meat. Dip was a type of salsa.

For the mains, we decided to share because we wanted to try it all. I couldn't resist my favourite Spaghetti Alla Corbonara, with some pigs belly, mounds of cheese, black pepper and fresh hen's egg. They mixed it at the table. It was amazing, a bit salty, but the al dente pasta and all the flavours, was the best I've tasted.

The Gnocchi was the best. I should have listened. The best Gnocchi I think I've tasted. With Gorgonzola cheese sauce, with walnuts, the Gnocchi, was pillowy and incredibly soft. The crunchy walnuts was a perfect compliment. 
The duck egg tagliatelle with duck ragù was okay. Salty a bit, but very full of flavour.

For dessert we shared a Calonni (not Canneloni). YUM... filled with a chocolate custard, and on top of Earl Grey infused sauce it was incredible."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10. We ended up with an amazing 4 course family style meal! Meats and cheeses! Stacked eggplant was to die for! Mushroom pizza was my favorite. As for pasta - SOPRESINI ALLE VONGOLE was amazing! Scallops yum! Good Italian wine selection."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. Overall, a pretty good experience. Been here once before. Had drinks at the bar, and was pleasantly surprised, the bartenders were very knowledgeable, and one of the guys had a super cool beard. Obviously, this was very impressive. 

Atmosphere was good. Food was excellent. Service was good. Only thing was that our main course took a LONG time to come out (that's why I'm not giving them a 5). Our appetizers weren't quick either... To be fair, we didn't have a reservation (apparently the other place wasn't in a nice enough area for one of our guests, but OK, f*** that... lol)

Veal was terrific, as well as the prosciutto with bread. Have no problem coming back."}
{"text":"Buca is one for those restaurants you have to book a week in advance if you plan on eating dinner at a reasonable time (i.e. no one likes a hangry date at 9:30pm).

Reasons why I keep booking reservations: 
The space has soaring ceilings and exposed brick walls. The wine list is extensive and the cocktail list (priced similarly to what to you can expect on King W.) is not offensive by any means. The pork blood pasta is one of my favourite dishes ever - for real. The basil gelato is amazing. The service is attentive (if not bordering on overly so, at times). Your coworkers will be like \"Oh, you were at Buca? Sick.\"

Reasons why I roll my eyes at the restaurant:
The nodoni are literally bread knots covered in some spice and olive oil - I don't get the hype, but maybe I've been conditioned by the media to hate gluten. Also, the waiter told us the tiramisu was the best in the whole city... I'm not saying this was necessarily fraudulent, but I wasn't convinced.

Reasons why I hate myself a little when I come:
Some of these dishes: (i) are definitely meant to be shared by more than 2 people ... Eating half of a burrata pizza was one of the most gluttonous things I have ever done, and (ii) are insanely priced ... To add \"preserves\" (literally like 3 pieces of pickled artichoke, a couple dabs of a savoury jam and a paint brush stroke of sauce) to your charcuterie, it cost $8. Never again. 

Bottom line: try the pork blood pasta. It is spicy, and you will cry - not because of the heat though. Because it is literally that good."}
{"text":"Words can't describe the quality of food and service at Buca. The ingredients used are fresh, flavours are well put together, and service exceeded expectations. My favourite dish was the sliced raw sea bream appetizer, which I can eat plates and plates of. The only bad thing I have to say about the whole experience is that it had to come to an end."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve 1 star, horrible service. We showed up a little early for our reservation. they made no effort to accomdate us to be seated. There was tons of opening table. I wouldn't bother waste my time or money eating here. Extremely rude and I'll never return"}
{"text":"Two stars...seems harsh, I know. But let me explain. 

When we arrived at Buca, we were blown away by the beautiful space: high ceilings, brick walls, cozy lighting, open kitchen...it was all stunning. It's also tucked away in a back alley, making you really feel like you're walking into a hidden gem. 

Truth is, in many ways it is. The space is lovely, the wine list extensive, and the food creative. The only problem is, I didn't really find the food to be that wowing. And, even after communicating our food restrictions, we were still served meat - not once, but twice.

We let our waitress know early on that we're vegetarian as the menu was quite meat-heavy and we wanted to be sure we wouldn't inadvertently eat meat. We started by ordering three cheeses and the selection of fresh baked breads. Much to our surprise, one of the loaves had little pork pieces in the bread. It wasn't until we asked our server what the little pink stuff was that she said it was pork. She quickly realized her error and apologized, but didn't even offer to take away the breads and bring us a new basket. Instead, we had to push the meat-stuffed buns off to the side and continue eating the non-meat ones. I was quite surprised that she wouldn't think to bring fresh buns that weren't mingling with the pork-based buns - not very accommodating to a vegetarian, or pork-free crowd.

Trying to remain excited about our meal, we shrugged off the first problem and ventured on. We then asked our server for her suggestions for mains. I was shocked when she suggested a main that had beef in it...like, hello, did we not just have the whole no-meat discussion?! Anyway, we continued on and ordered a squid-ink pizza with calamari on it (ok, ok, we admit, we are  occasional pescatarians), an order of gnocci - asking that they hold the meat (which she told us was possible), a salad (sorry I cant recall which one), and an order of the spaghetti pomodoro. 

What do you know, but our mains come out and the gnocci has meat in it. Suffice to say, we were at this point quite fed up. We quickly let our waitress know the mistake, she again apologized, and we were at least this time given a fresh plate of gnocci. By this point, we had lost all trust in the competence of the staff at Buca to not inadvertently serve us some meat. It put a bad taste in our mouths (literally) and made the rest of the meal and bit uncomfortable. 

We stayed for dessert and coffee, paid our bill and left. The company was lovely, the space amazing, but the food -- not really worth it. I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan of Buca and I likely won't come back, certainly not for the food."}
{"text":"Been a few times and have to say: Best Italian food in the city. I normally don't eat desert. the tiramisu was amazing   The meats. Red meats are top notch. Make your main dish red meat. Veal is the best. Ambience is rustic."}
{"text":"I really want to give this restaurant 4 stars but this time around was just average. 

The atmosphere and service is all on par, but they fell short on the food.  I loved the pig ear app and my duck pasta was good.  But my wife's Branzino had far too much acid in it.  Doused with lemon juice and lemon rind all over it.  Same for the dandelion side, full of vinegar and basically a wilted mess.

I hold this restaurant to the highest standards, which with the reputation and prices, they should be met."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here while on a business trip on the recommendation from our hotel. We were having a rough day (Uber car wrecked on our way to the airport, hotel lost our reservation) so we really just wanted some quality Italian. I ordered a Manhattan to drink, which was delicious, but problems arose once the food started to show up. 

We ordered the burrata salad, which was unlike any burrata I've ever seen. Rather then being stringy, moist and slightly gelatinous, the burrata was hard and had an odd flavor to it. We sent it back. I then ordered a pizza and my friend got the halibut. The pizza was actually quite good. Good sauce to cheese ratio and quality crust. My friend's halibut, however, came out with multiple brown hairs in it. It was disgusting. He sent one back and when a second arrived we were disgusted to find another brown hair in it. The waiter handled this like a champ and was very apologetic and polite. He comped us the whole meal, but that wasn't enough to save this place from a 2/5. Buyer beware of the brown hair!"}
{"text":"We stepped out of the taxi, wandered through an ally, and straight into Italy.  I've never been to Italy, but I imagine this is what it would be, since it did not look like any of the American Italian restaurants I've ever dined in. The ultra-slender wait staff (they can't possibly eat any food) with pointy, shiny shoes were well-mannered, but stand-off-ish compared to my American-friendly standards, but when in Rome, right?  I almost felt badly for wearing my jeans, and then realized, I am not stuffing myself into an uncomfortable outfit when I look pretty hot just the way I am.  

I don't like cheese, eggs, or offal, so this menu was very un-Cyndi-friendly.  Beautiful, creative, authentic, but it took me a while to find a dish I could eat.  We settled on the bread knots, crusty little orbs of dough in olive oil and rosemary and the fried olives, succulent morsels stuffed with sausage and coated in a light breading (but I've had better).  The wine list was all Italian, which, I suppose, is a good thing for an Italian restaurant, but being the Californian wine snob that I am, I had to select a wine that was well over what I wanted to pay, and it was merely drinkable, not outstanding (if I'd paid the same price for a California wine, it would have been a truly delicious bottle).  My husband had a cheese and foie gras ravioli dish that even he was effusive and overly complimentary about.  It was beautiful and clearly took hours upon hours to make.  I settled on a simple grilled fish with lemon and olives, nothing else, no veg, just a small plate of skinny fish (with two bones that I nearly choked upon).  I am a meat-eater, I will choose steak 99 times out of 100 if it is offered, but there sadly was no steak, so I chose the fish.  It was nicely cooked, light, flaky and flavorful, but still left me desiring something more.  

We skipped out on dessert, the prices here are ridiculous (and I don't mind spending money on great food, but this was not GREAT food that merited these prices), and the service is very stand-off-ish.  Not a restaurant I'd return to, given the many restaurants I've dined on that hit on all my favorite points and didn't make me feel like I was \"uncultured,\" even though I know my food and wine."}
{"text":"Don't spend your money here. Two years ago I was told this was one of the best high end Italian restaurants by a friend. I'm not sure if something has gone wrong with this restaurant since then but my first meal there in Dec 2016 was overpriced , dry, over cooked and weirdly lacking in flavour. We had the stuffed fried olives which were overcooked and dry. The noudi bread balls were cute but again small and hard ( overcooked) with only a little tiny speck of softness on the inside. It was just a few tiny balls of dough in olive oil and rosemary. The tortellini dish was a disaster. I have had amazing broth based pasta dishes at less expensive restaurants in the city. What minuscule amount of pasta we got was dry and tough, the filling had very little flavour and the clarified chicken stock was lacklustre . The dish lacked any herb and would have looked a lot more appealing if it had something else to bring flavour and colour to the dish besides the yellow tortellini and a similarly coloured yellow stock.  Honestly this dish was an embarrassment. The tiramisu was also strangely bright yellow and was off on the ratio of biscuit to cream. I'm not sure if I had a full mouthful of biscuit in my serving. We spent $140 here for two and probably ate $3- $5 worth of poorly prepared flavourless food that I could have cooked better at home. This restaurant seems to be mostly about hype and is frankly quite a rip off. It wasn't just a bad day , it was bad menu items/recipes and bad execution. I haven't reacted so strongly against a restaurant for a longtime, I felt obligated to write this review. I eat out a lot in Toronto and I have never before eaten in a restaurant at this price point that performed so poorly on all 4 dishes I tried. Diner beware."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the sausage stuffed green olives deep fried (breaded), unique taste and tasty

Spaghetti with veal mini meatballs in tomato basilsauce ok, not great or memorable

service was good, prices a little steep"}
{"text":"Cute interior and fun location.
The menu is interesting albeit overpriced.
We started with the cheese board and it was quite good.
I got gnocchi and it was fine, but definitely not special enough to warrant the steep price.
My boyfriend got the Branzino and that was amazing.
May or may not return."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Vancouver and this restaurant came highly recommended from locals - did not disappoint! We ordered appies and two pizzas to share, of which I especially loved the nodini (bread knots for the garlic lover!) and parmigiana di melanzane (eggplant and burrata tower). Topped off the meal with rhubarb goat milk gelato which was creamy but not too sweet a.k.a. perfect for me.

Service was solid. Make sure to make a reso as this place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants and, in my opinion, the best Italian in the city!  I love Buca and am always delighted to dine here.  Buca never disappoints.  

Usual go tos are the nodini (little bread knots - everyone loves them) and eggplant melanzane (perfect).  I've tried various pastas and pizzas and everything I've had has been excellent.  The pasta menu is seasonal so the dishes do vary.  The gnocchi is quite possibly the best pasta I've eaten in my life.  The tiramisu is also excellent.  I could happily get fat eating here.

I particularly enjoy dining at the bar.  The bartenders have an excellent knowledge of wine and I've tried many new wines here which I have enjoyed.

Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

+ Of course, the Bigoli ($21): Not sure if it is the the duck egg in this pasta or the chef's impeccable timing but the chewiness of this pasta is al dente heaven
+ The service: from the host that enthusiastically answered my numerous questions on how to properly pronounce all the Italian words on their menu (did you know that Pesce is Pe-SHAY, not Pes-KAY?!) to the waiter that diligently offered to exchange my PORK BLOOD Chocolate Tart for a Lavender Peach Sorbet (both were equally weird but I didn't want to trouble our friendly waiter for a return 2x. Just stick with the tried and true Tiramisu people)
+ Romantique and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience. I read about Buca on Eater and it was also recommended by a friend's friend. 

The space itself is sleek and beautiful. But it's also loud, so much so that I could barely hear my dining companions unless they were shouting. The space could use some warmth. 

The food was okay. We liked the garlic knots and cheese plate as well as the pastas. The carbornara stood out. The pizza was bland and warm at best. 

Where Buca really falls apart is the service. Now it's possible it could be remedied if you were able to hear your server. But that would mean my server would have had to come to the table. Obviously she didn't. She dropped off the menus and took our water orders. She then spent a very very long time to return, at which point we placed our orders - not just drink but for everything. It would have been nice for her to return to take our drink orders and ask us if we have any questions. After our food delivered, she all but disappeared. Not once did she come by to ask if we wanted another drink as our cocktail glasses sat empty. We had to repeatedly flag down other waitresses and bussers to get water. 

I had told the restaurant that we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Though none of us placed a dessert order, I thought they'd still bring something small out as most other restaurants do. 

I guess I could live with some of these things but not at this price point. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Buca. What an awesome space. I hadn't been for a while so a friend and I had dinner there last night. 

You have to try the eggplant parmigiana. It is so good. I also had the duck pasta with duck ragu and it was amazing! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so flavourful.

We finished with a trio of house-made ice cream. Wow. I want to go back right now."}
{"text":"Trendy decor, quite noisy though. Extensive wine list. Other reviewers are correct about small portion size. Food was good, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"great salumi, bone marrow ravioli, bison tartar... can't remember what else i ordered.. but was all good..
def will go back.. especially if i had to entertain someone in town..
gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and splendid service.
 
Started with the Bread Balls and Bruschetta. Followed by the Bulgogi Pasta, Branzino fish, and their Cauliflower dish. 

Each dish was fresh, full of flavor, and creative. This was a great meal."}
{"text":"I had the halibut. It was amazing! Best dish I had in a while, like for ral. Montepulciano was amazing too."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto and I was asking all my friends which is the best Italian restaurant and Buca was top of the list. I had to make to I tried Buca before leaving. We ordered the beef carpaccio and it was the best one I've had to date. It was extremely buttery and melts in your mouth. A layer of cheese is on top of the carpaccio and made all the difference in the dish. It came with a side of bread that you eat with which really helped spread the flavour a bit. We also ordered a pizza and pasta but unfortunately there was miscommunication with the server and he didn't place the pasta order while we were slowly finishing our pizza. I was a little disappointed but overall what we had was delicious and highly recommend Buca. The atmosphere in the restaurant really gives off an Italian vibe."}
{"text":"This is truly an inspiration of Italian culture. As an Italian I was pleased with nearly every dish ordered and I embrace this very different menu. Pizza is ok but not great and having been here many times I notice most people are scared off from the very strange and different offerings and order pizza and pasta which I assume customers are playing safe."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a late dinner on a Friday.  The restaurant is open concept with two sperate rooms and you are able to see the ktichen.  We were greated by the managers, had a nice chat with the bartenders and our waiter was wonderful.  I had so-so expectations of the food and I was wrong!  Everything was simply amazing and burting with flavour.  It's such a simple concept but I was thankful for the scissors with my pizza.....Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice looking, but they ran out of all the foods we could eat on the menu and didn't tell us they were out of food before we sat down. 

So we had to leave after we had already ordered wine and settled in to try to find another place to eat. They were nice about it but it would have been far better if they had been up front about their lack of food so we could have made better choices instead of ruining our evening."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding the Bigoli pasta was fantastic and was absolutely perfect.  The small plate apps were good I really liked the lambs brains and enjoyed the tuna crudo. Had a lovely dessert great americano as well. The wine was good but the cocktails and Amaro were only fair hence the one star off. I'd go back in a moment."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and will continue to go back. Interior is raw and stunning - food is excellent and service overall is great."}
{"text":"Great place for a dinner date! 

Food 4/5: We started with the Parmigiana di Melanzane, which is basically an eggplant parm. The tomato sauce was flavourful with fresh basil and the eggplant perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was disappointed at the amount of burrata cheese they gave but they did give a fair bit of ricotta. Next we shared the Bigoli, the sauce was rich and flavourful however the noodles were a bit too al dente for me, it was more like they weren't cooked properly. Then we had the Gnocchi Ripieni, and although you only get 6 pieces, its pretty heavy as each piece is stuffed with cheese.The dumping skin is so soft, you almost can't tell where the skin ends and the cheese begins. For dessert we shared 2 scoops of gelato (white chocolate cranberry and chocolate) and one scoop of sorbet (blood orange beet). The sorbet was by far my favourite - it almost tasted like strawberries and was so light and refreshing, the perfect way to end the meal! The white chocolate cranberry was also very nice but I found the chocolate to be nothing special (however my partner loved it and it was his favourite). My only suggestion would be for them to use chilled glass or metal plates as the ice cream melted fairly quickly on the ceramic.  

Drinks 5/5: I ordered the BarBuca (I hope that's right, I can't find their cocktail menu online to confirm), a beet infused vodka drink and was immediately blown away! I had to order a second! The drink is sweet and cold, tastes like real beets. I also had a cappuccino which comes with a little piece of biscotti. 

Service 5/5: Our server was really nice, as it was our first time here she explained the menu to us and was great about us ordering one dish at a time as we wanted to share everything and relax during the meal. Our plates and cutlery were refreshed between every course and our water constantly filled. 

Atmosphere 4/5: The restaurant is smaller than I had pictured and the dinning room is split into 2 sections. One room is small and more modern looking with walls lined with wine bottles, the other room is bigger with very high ceilings and the walls are entirely brick."}
{"text":"Its not the same anymore. The first time I came here two year ago, the place looked different, good energy and marvelous tasty itallian food; seasonal food like rabbit, quail and other specials were available too. Presentation of everything was just exquisite and the serves went far and beyond. 

However, I came here a week ago with three friends and the serve might have had a bad day because she was extremely rude. The interior felt more like a cafeteria and I didn't find it pretty. I loved what they had before. There was a lack of presentation and the food wasn't anything great for the price you pay. Now it is just expensive without a reason. Sorry Buca."}
{"text":"I came here a long while back. We sat on the patio in the back. Good vibes. The negronis were excellent as well as the lobster ravioli. We also shared a charcuterie board. Good stuff."}
{"text":"The location was hard to find as they were doing some construction/renovations. I'd say the entrance was on the Portland side of the intersection.

The mood of the restaurant was a romantic rustic feel which was nice. I haven't been on a romantic dinner with my other half in a while :P
The place used to be a textile factory and Buca kept some of the elements to create a \"lofty\" kind of environment.
The washrooms were weird lol. They had one separate tap for cold water and another for hot, so you freeze your hands or burn your hands while washing them. Pick our fate LOL.

The service was amazing. From the hostess to our waitress and the chef who got our food to us and explained the details of taste notes in each dish. I really appreciated the above and beyond service. I worked in customer service and I know the dedication that goes into making sure the customers have a great experience. 

FOOD!
I started with the CERVELLO. It was lamb's brains alla saltimbocca, sicilian caper agliata.
It was interesting. I wish a different meat was rolled over the brains as I couldn't get a hold of the flavours of the lamb because of the saltiness of the prosciutto. I know, I know that it's supposed to be wrapped in prosciutto, but thats my personal opinion :)
Then we had the GNOCCHI DI RICOTTA. It was hand rolled nettle and basil dumplings, barolotti beans, preserved tomato, chili, savory, pecorino. I don't usually order gnocchi unless I'm at Nonnas ;) but it was sooooo good. Well done! It melted in my mouth. Wasn't chewy and the basil pesto was such an amazing touch from the taste to the aroma.
The TORTELLI also equally as good as the Gnocchi. It was fresh saffron pasta stuffed with lobster, buffalo ricotta and zucchini, summer squash, smoked tomato, nepitella, whey butter. Mmm It was so decadent, sweet, savoury, and smooth on the pallet. The pasta was perfectly cooked. Not rubbery. I was eating it so slowly to favour every moment of a bite :D
We finished with espresso and an interesting dessert. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the dessert, but I'll describe it to you.
It was a decadent pork blood chocolate tart with a hint of spiciness to it. It had salt and sugar sprinkled in top with a scoop of a south american vanilla bean gelato ouuu! and it was set on FIRE!!! HAHAHA. Of course I had to order the dessert that was set on fire :D
Man oh man it was so good. sweet, salty, spicy, warm and chilled all at the same time. I had a great experience eating this dessert. I wanted to take it home as it was so decadent and couldn't finish it but forgot :(

I recommend you visit this place. They will take good care of you, your taste buds and your belly like a good Italian resto should ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last week on Monday.

The high-ceilings and attractive interior design were noticable upon entering, as was the bottle of hard-to-find Oxley gin behind the bar.  The food, unfortunately, was less impressive.

Cicora (salad of dandelion, gorgonzola, macerated berries):  Okay, not awesome.  Slightly difficult to eat on account of the dandelion greens being cut too coarsely.  The berries and gorgonzola went well together, but would have been more balanced if the berries had been a bit sweeter.

Lamb skewers with lemon and cracked pepper: too chewey, not tender; the lemon was interesting.

Fried sausage-stuffed olives: nice crunchy exterior, mild and tender interior.  I would have liked the sausage stuffing to have a bit more character (e.g. texture, spice, fat, etc.)

Bigali (duck egg pasta with duck ragu, mascarpone, basil): pleasantly springy al dente pasta, and subtle cinnamon in the ragu.  This was pleasant to eat with really no complaints.

Quail (citrus-rubbed, with pickled cherries, spelt, parmigiano): the quail was competently-grilled (tender and moist), pickled cherries were a nice complement and distinctive.  The spelt with parmigiano was a nice accompaniment both in terms of flavor and texture.  I was also pleased by the presence of rosemary.

Crostatina (bufala ricotta lemon tart with concord grapes and lavender): the ricotta was nice and light, lemon flavor and sweetness were well-balanced and on the mild side.  The crust was nice and firm.  The grapes had rather large, hard, and bitter seeds which was 
annoying.  The lavender was mostly imaginary.

While a few of the dishes were satisfying, several were disappointing, and nothing really wowed me.  Overall I was disappointed, especially given the price point."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night to a pretty busy restaurant. Folks were really quick to check our coats. Tried the 3 cheese with bread knots. The bread knots had great flavor but were a bit too awkwardly hard. Cheese were very delicious. Great wine selection and grabbed a nice light bodied red. Our server recommended that we have try the blood pasta which was really quite spicy and the pizza. I thought it could have used more sauce. Nothing that special. For the price, I expected more from the food. Not running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, I usually don't do reviews but I went here with my boyfriend and a friend and the phrase \"value for money\" plays no part at this restaurant. For a bill that totalled $160 for 3 people, we had two pizzas that lacked flavour and one pasta dish that was reportedly delicious but not worth $28. Don't be fooled by the truffle mushroom, they were not anything like the authentic black truffle mushrooms that I have had before... Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I saw and heard the great reviews at Buca and they delivered. After coat check, I was escorted to the smaller dining room. The menu was simple and the our server Andrea was very attentive. We got the ORECCHIO DI MAIALE,SPAGHETTI AL NERO DI MAIALE, and BIGOLI. The pig ears were not oily nor leather-y. Seasoned and fried to perfection + super tender. The pork blood pasta was tossed by another server and he explained Venetian spices which was quite nice. The bigoli's pasta was super thick and at first bite I thought it was too al dente. But as I kept eating it, the texture was great and the creaminess won us over. Everything was cooked to perfection. The drinks were also yummy as well. Would love to go here again for a lovely quiet dinner service."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch and Dinner
Specialty: Italian
Menu items: Nodini, Bigoli, Mortadella Pizza, Orecchiette and Tiramisu

\"Buona Sera\" and \"Prego\" are Buca's staff most used words. From the moment you enter the premises to the moment you leave, all you hear is Italian. All you eat and taste is Italian, and even the menu items have their original Italian names. So with this, I have decided to dive deep into Chef Rob Gentile's food by tasting his dishes in two different occasions. After all, when is Italian ever too much?

Starting with the Nodini, I begin my journey into the master pieces Gentile has created. Nodini are warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary and garlic...tons of garlic. These are mostly known by locals as \"garlic balls\" and eaten with frequency as part of the course of appetizer items.
The texture of the Nodini is crunchy yet soft and the olive oil melts in your mouth and drips on your fingers as you bite into them.
Although I would prefer a rather smaller portion of the Nodini to come as a compliment to the meal (Buca charges for the bread), I have to say this is a must order item from the menu.

Next in the journey is the famous Bigoli pasta. I say famous because Buca's menu changes often and the Bigoli always makes it on both the lunch and dinner menu.
Bigoli is a hand crafted duck egg pasta with duck ragu, basil and mascarpone cheese. The best part of this dish is definitely the taste of the freshly hand-made pasta. The duck is heavily present through the dish and the basil gives it a nice herb-like taste. The mascarpone is a nice touch as well, but in my mind it lessens the intensity of the duck ragu. A nice stronger Italian cheese would make this dish stand out more, but then again this is my personal preference.

Buca's famous scissors-ready hand made pizzas, also made it on my must order list of items. Chef Gentile prides himself on serving great charcuterie style dishes and continues to carry on his theme by adding cured meats to his variety of pizzas. The Mortadella pizza is certainly one of them. Drizzled with a light pesto sauce and based with a creamy cheese, this white flat bread pizza is one that you would want to cut with your scissors all night long.

Jumping back to the pastas, on my second visit I decided to switch up my order and get the Orecchiette pasta.I would have to compliment Chef Gentile on finally introducing brussel sprouts, currently my fave veggie, into traditional Italian pastas. I personally never thought you could add it to a pasta well enough to make it taste good. To my surprise and delight, I was proven wrong.

Orecchiette is a kind of pasta originally form the region of Puglia. Traditionally made with rapini, broccoli and green beans, this pasta is known for its \"ear\" shape style. Knowing that scallops and bacon go well together, Buca introduces a pasta that mixes the best of the sea with B.C. scallops and the best of the pig, with some nice pancetta (aka Italian bacon). And if this wasn't enough, brussel sprouts, white beans and a touch of butter will definitely have you asking for seconds and thirds. I personally like the way the scallops were thinly sliced to maintain the dishe's size consistency and not overpower any of the other ingredients by making it just a \"scallop\" pasta. Grazie Chef Gentile.

Last but not least on this delicious journey, and probably one of the best Italian desserts I have had is Buca's Tiramisu.
Yum, Yum, Yum. These are all the words I have for Buca's Tiramisu. The first Yum is for the delicious brûlée crust which gave this dessert a nice crème brûlée feel to it. The second Yum is for the incredible taste of the creamy mascarpone and various layers of creamy goodness in between; and the third Yum is for the bottom-filled dessert with some nice espresso sauce, which make me go deep with my spoon. Into the dessert, of course!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Buca, but it won't be my last. Overall, a great meal and experience.

To start, the place is hard to find. I felt like an idiot wandering down the little alleyway trying to find the entrance. But once inside, it is lovely: decorated simply and comfortably, it has a spacious feel without being pretentious. 

Service was excellent throughout the night. We were a bit picky about tables and temperature, first asking to be in a corner or side, then asking to move because it was a bit warm, and finally asking to turn off the forced air as we were chilly. The hostess and waiter were very kind and accommodating. Our waiter was very \"present\" without hovering, and ne'er was the water glass empty nor we without attention. He presented the daily menu, and then did an exceptional job of explaining almost every dish when I asked for his recommendations. Cocktail orders were taken promptly, and while they weren't the *best* drinks I've had, they were well made and arrived quickly.

Our waiter suggested an appetizer each (hot or cold) and sharing mains and sides, which was wise as portions were on the smaller side. To start, we had the cold \"sea bream\" and tuna paté appetizers. The tuna was unusual and creative; good but not amazing. The sea bream was fantastic: light and fresh, and very flavourful. For mains, we each had a homemade pasta. Mine was agnolotti stuffed with rabbit and cheese (marscapone?) and it was rich and salty and delicious. We also shared the cauliflower \"carbonara\" which was a bit salty but also scrumptious. Upon request, our waiter recommended wines by the glass that paired perfectly with each meal. 

All in all, it was a bit pricey but not exceptionally so, and the entire experience was lovely and enjoyable. Will definitely be back and would recommend..."}
{"text":"Buca came highly recommended by a friend who used to live in Toronto and we are so glad they passed it along. Our meal at Buca was quick but amazing. The quick part was only because we had limited time before heading over to watch a film for Hot Docs so we booked ahead the earliest reservation possibly at 5pm. Upon seating we let our waiter know that we had to be out by 6, got a slightly funny look but he said they would do their best. 

Our meal at Buca was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a long time. I wasn't even super hungry by the time our food came (prob because it was only like 5:30!) but it was delish. Two of us ordered the Bigoli and the other two ordered something else that I can't remember because my Bigoli was so damn good! 

Wish we had more time to sample more off the menu but Buca will definitely be on my list for whenever I visit Toronto again. Drinks are yummy too! Oh and service was good, quick and they got us out right on time. Lots of cabs in the area since King is so busy and the restaurant is tucked away just off the main street and downstairs, really cool space with a lot of light in the main room."}
{"text":"I got a tortellini i dont rememer what it was called but it was delicious. Handcrafted green tortellini stuffed with goose and porcini mushrooms. A creamy delectable bufala sauce... AMAZING RESTAURANT. Top quality food. Best italian by far."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner at Buca.  We started with olives and bread knots, both wonderfully garlicky.  I had a veal dinner and my colleague had black cod.  The veal had shaved black trumpet mushrooms in a creamy sauce that was just a tiny bit sweet.  The cod came with a light tomato based sauce that complimented the fish perfectly.  We finished off with some gelatti.  perfect ending.  Service was good, if a bit formal.  We were able to get in on a Monday night without a reservation."}
{"text":"I think I found where Canadian Actors work. (hint: it's here). Why is everyone here better looking than me? Why do they get to wear stylish yet somewhat intimidating (boarder-line scary) leather aprons? Why am I wearing my husky jeans?

Anyway, enough of that.  I think Buca takes Italian food to a different extreme, no not pasta from a can stupid, like real Italian food. It's crazy good, with ingredients that would make most of us Yanks a bit squeamish, like oh I don't know...lamb brains. Not something we eat in California...normally.

The atmosphere is amazing. The wait staff is friendly and informative yet also better than you. Well okay maybe just better looking than me, though I think I've mentioned that like 5 times already. 

So just know that this place is pricey and probably way more hip than you are. If you are on vacation and are wearing husky jeans and want to burn some money (or you know have rich parents/trust fund/expense account, okay I'm exaggerating) do come here, it's really good and a great experience."}
{"text":"our first night in toronto was our best as far as dinners go. dining al fresco with great classical music being piped through the speakers, a solid negroni in my hand, excellent menu, and an adorable italian server fresh off the boat... 

we started with a stacked and fried eggplant dish that was not memorable, a dandelion and fermented ricotta salad, carpaccio, and then the lamb brains - my favorite of the four, wrapped in prosciutto. all good, but no huge standout. i believe the lamb brains would have really benefited from a different choice of salumi. they have so many there, and i would've gone more earthy. the sharp salt bite of the prosciutto detracted from the dish, which is a brilliant use of brains. i'd have loved to try it with coppa or even guanciale. wow.

i had the orecchiette with whelks and P had a ravioli stuffed with ricotta. both were near flawless. really wonderful pasta. they won me over right there and then. 

because god bless a good plate of pasta..."}
{"text":"Prepare for smaller portions than your typical Italian Restaurant. That said, the wine lists and cocktails are adventurous and lovely. The entrées are impeccable and give a great salute to their perchance for crafting artisanal pastas from local and housemade ingredients. Next time will definitely do the dégustation."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant in late fall based on some recommendations from friends.  My only, single complaint about this gorgeous restaurant is that I absolutely hate when you fight like hell for a reservation and get \"squeezed in\" and when you show up the place is empty. It happened for our 7pm reservation and I'm sorry but a bustling atmosphere is 50% of any meal in my opinion! However, by 7:30 more people trickled in and the place was busy by the time we left at 8:30.
We started with the garlic balls and a roasted beet salad, both were fine I especially loved the freshness of the in-season beets. I ordered a spiced pumpkin pasta with shaved truffles while my husband ordered a pizza. My pasta was absolutely to die for and without a doubt one of the best bites of food I think I have ever taken! My husband liked his pizza and especially liked the pizza sicissors! I felt like it was ok, just a normal pizza nothing special . . . maybe it just paled in comparison to my pasta.
When we return I will try the polenta & the house made olives as both looked exceptional.
Wine list is extensive and pairs well. Staff was nice and not too snooty."}
{"text":"If you've been to Napoli, Italy and tried pizza from L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele you will love Buca's Pomodoro E Tartufo ($29). They use a moretti forni oven and the crust is baked to perfection. The sauce is very lite and sweet and is topped with basil, truffled burrata cheese and scorzone truffles! 
Unfortunately they were out of truffles at the time we went, however the pizza was still absolutely incredible! 

My second favorite dish was their Baigoli (torchio extruded duck egg pasta). I'm not a huge fan of ordering pizza and pasta in the same meal but this decision I was not disappointed with. The sauce was the perfect consistency and the pasta was cooked al dente."}
{"text":"Wow, what an experience. The waitress and waiters describe the food with such elaborate description that it just sounds so good.

They were super helpful and when the fish perhaps fell a bit from it's plating, they took it back to redo!

The garlic knots, probably the most disappointing. The pictures make it look amazing but the taste does not live up.

What was delicious is the pasta in pigs blood, at first it had this spicy kick but after a while it subsides. The spaghetti in anchovy sauce, while described as overwhelming. I felt I didn't even taste it.

The black cod, was the highlight of the dinner. So light, flaky, and so much flavor.

The one thing i think they could improve on is figuring out how to greet people as they come in. I walked in and didn't know who worked there. And then someone who I was standing next to spoke to me. And as I was leaving, could tell they didn't know who was leaving or coming in."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing food - inventive menu that was excellently prepared.  Fantastic service.  I can't say a negative thing."}
{"text":"This is one of the rare times that I've wished Yelp had a hidden sixth stars for experiences as sublime as this one. 

From the moment I stepped into Buca, I felt myself transported to Old World Italy where the servers spoke to me in fluent Italian, fully expecting me to respond in like.  The service was impeccable, the wine choices unbelievable and the food every bit as good as one would expect for the prices you pay.  Even though the meal for two of us cost around over $400 (including a bottle of their best Amarone), I can easily say that it was worth every penny.

We had their salumi, fromaggi, raviolio, bisonte, panne cotta, and tiramisu... every morsel of every portion was thoroughly enjoyable.  This was a meal that I shall not soon forget, and that I shall fondly recollect many times in the future."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan. Came a few minutes early and staff was unwilling to seat myself and my girlfriend despite having 6 tables empty while patrons continued to leave. The host was inept and could only tell me I was free to wait a half hour and I couldn't be accommodated. For fine dining this is poor service. The wait staff even made suggestions but the host couldn't get it together but was more than happy to seat what appeared to be his regulars. Unprofessional and fairly rude this evening. Won't return after he happily cancelled our reservation. Waiting in the cold is better than waiting around for them to get their acts together and decide to seat us. I'm unclear as to why they act so snooty and their food nor service is worthy of any acclaim. This isn't a Michelin star restaurant so you have no reason to act in such a poor fashion. Hopefully they will continue construction and close both entrances to this horrid place. Last time I'll make a stop on king west to this place. I would avoid if your seeking good food and service."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  From the olives to the salumi & cheese platter and the fresh pasta and fish dishes- Buca must have someone's grandmother from Italy in their kitchen putting all that time and love into each dish.  They do not rush you through your meal.  The service was perfect.  Do Not miss out on this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, out of this world food and great (and reasonably priced) wine, gave us a take home pasta kit as an anniversary gift-- the best experience you could have at a restaurant in TO!"}
{"text":"We were here tonight.  Delish!
We had the 3 selections of salumi, the eggplant, and the margherita pizza with burrata cheese (super yummy).

The pumpkin stuff pasta was delish as was the veal!

Everything was really yummy - we also had the tiramisu and a pork blood chocolate torte (a must try, and not as gross as you might think).

Totally worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I have just eaten my favourite meal in Toronto in 2011...... I've been dying to try this place, and trying to find the right person to eat this meal with (aside from my hubby). When V told me she was coming to town - I had to book this one. Not having seen the menu, I have been looking to other people's pictures and hoping that my meal would be just as good. The place definitely didn't disappoint.... the 10pm reservation seemed late, but worked out to be a spectacular evening of great conversation and just as great food (if not better!)

Looking for the little red lit sign off of King, we walked into a path to a door in the back of a building. As I walked in, I see a beautiful chandelier and walked down a staircase to a beautiful dining room, wooden walls, and noticing the ch\efs cooking away in the kitchen. There were lots of people chatting, eating, waiting. We gave our names and went to the bar for a drink..... wish I had the name with me but I had a pear-like martini that was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The last time I had such a great pear martini was at Lummi Island in Washington. This was definitely comparable and I could have drank it all night. V had the fig martini with a chestnut that tasted just as delectable.

Soon after, we we brought to our table.... in the wine cellar at the bank - much darker, enclosed and much more echo-ey. If you are beside a big group, you may need to raise your voice a little higher!

Having read a few reviews about Buca, I heard the burata with eggplant was a must - it was creamy, but not heavy, and the eggplant did not seem like it was overfried or too mushy. The textures and flavours worked beautifully together.

For mains, we shared the Duck Egg Pasta with duck ragu (and I kept thinking there was a raw duck egg), and the Goose and Fois Gois  Tortelli pasta in sweet butter sauce with balsamic. Everything was like heaven in your mouth. I must say that I expected the duck egg pasta to be more saucy, but I liked how the texture was a little dry and you can taste the pieces of duck as you enjoyed each bite. The tortelli was creamy and rich, and even though the temperature of it had cooled down, I was still enjoying every bite like it was my first. The butter sauce was like condensed milk and I wanted to smuther ever bite in it. It was salty, but sweet - a mixed sensation. Not being a big fan of rosemary, I just couldn't get enough of the pieces that added a nice crunch to the filling. The pasta itself seemed a tad underdone, but I can only imagine that in-house pasta was extremely hard to master and the cooking process is difficult and takes much precision.

Halfway through dinner, I ordered a kiwi martini, which was okay, but I don't think anything would have lived up to the pear martini (I would really like a glass right now!)

Dinner would not have not been complete without DESSERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After looking through the list, it seemed obvious to get the traditional tiramisu. There was pana cotta, some chocolate cake... and then V suggested we get another tortellini - with quince, more BURRATA and other goodness that has changed my life. This was probably the one dessert I was not planning to get, only because I was unfamiliar with what it was. But believe me - this is something special. With 5 pieces, it will be good enough to share with someone special. The burrata was creamy, the quince was smooth and not overly sweet. The tortellini was very thin, making it even more delicate.

If I had the money, I would eat here every chance I could. The waiter were knowledgeable and explained everything that came out. All the menus are date stamped and we took one to commemorate our lovely evening.

oh... i'm in love... with buca 52!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  The seating was excellent near the kitchen and service was excellent.  All staff were helpful and recommended a great wine pairing.  The appetizers, dinner and dessert were all fantastic and prepared very well.  I will definitely return here the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are the best. I had the gnocchi and it was good but some how I expected better. Could be the hype. You spend and you receive good Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Our visit to Buca was deeply disappointing. After reading much reviews, we bought into the notion this was a great place for dinner. Sadly it is over-hyped to be called one of the Top Restaurants in Canada.

Service was rude, derogatory and pejorative. Our server snickered when we declined to order wine. He questioned why we wanted to share appetizers, pizza and an entrée instead of offering us share plates.

Our Branzino took over 30 mins to arrive after we had almost finished our pizza.
I would not recommend Buca to anyone local nor visiting. 

There are too many choices than to endure bad service."}
{"text":"Food was great, and some of the dishes were quite interesting and new for me.
However, Id stay away from the apps, because they were quite petite and nothing special (such as the olives, and the garlic knots). 

However the pizzas and pastas are excellent. Would definitely come back here for those. Great flavours. 
Dessert was nice as well. 

Drinks are very strong and great tasting. Definitely recommend them.
Service was one of the best I've experienced so far in the city. very professional. 

My complaint was the rude GM (Im assuming). Put off an attitude as if he was better than everyone else/didn't enjoy his job much. Quite the odd one in the bunch. Threw off my mood for the night."}
{"text":"The hype is real.  This place will transport you right to Italy with their delicious fresh food.  The service is friendly, professional and won't make you feel rushed if you want to have a long dinner with friends.  

I love coming here with medium sized group (3-8 people-ish) and getting a whole bunch of dishes to split."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and glad we dined here.  Setting is great, exposed brick, proper lighting and cozy.  Service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, informative but left us alone while eating.  As each dish was served, he gave a empassioned and detailed explanation of ingredients.  It was great.  The food was all delicious, especially the pasta.  The 4 of us opted to share the suckling pig, and they threw in the pig's head for good measure.  Perfectly prepared, juicy and crispy skin.  Overall, a great experience and would rank this place easily among any of the \"great\" places in Napa (we just returned a couple weeks earlier)."}
{"text":"Having spent the better part of 3 weeks basically eating our way through downtown Toronto, I think we're pretty well versed on what's good in Toronto, and what's not.  Buca falls in between, somewhere in no man's land.  Perhaps that was high expectations on our part.  Great Italian is marked by fresh pastas and bright sauces.  Each bite after the other is reminiscent of the first brilliant fork full.

Buca comes highly acclaimed and lauded by many.  However, we found it disappointing.  Most of the first courses were spectacular.  The second courses not so much, but the dessert course even better than the first.  We ordered pretty much enough to sample all the cheeses and meats that day, as well as the foie terrine, truffle covered pizze, to boot.  The terrine was perfect, and complemented with just enough salt, sweet, and creaminess that everyone can appreciate.  The cheeses were pretty standard, though very excellent.  Now that pizze.  Though I craved the truffles on top, the sauce made it spectacular.  Hard to convey in words, but just think of the best pizza you ever had and imagine how perfectly sweet, how perfectly spiced, and how it perfectly complemented everything in that slice.  

Second courses were quite the 180.  The bigoli wasn't what I had in mind.  It comes neatly presented, but by the time you're about 3/4 way through, you aren't has happy as when you started.  The sauce had no kick.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't spectacular.  Needless to say, I finished it (it's pasta, after all), but welcomed dessert.  

Now this is where most Italian restaurants phone it in.  A little basic tiramisu, espresso, some sorbetto, simple cheesecake, etc.  Not Buca, they tried and blew me away with one of the most memorable desserts to date.  This buffalo mozzarella panna cotta has got to be one of the top desserts in Toronto.  This panna cotta, typically a heavy/creamy gelatin-like custard, is re-imagined as a fluffy dome sitting atop a pistachio biscotti and what seemed like a grape sauce.  Pretty much heaven in my book.

Service left a little something to be desired.  Some waiters seemed really enthusiastic about that night, others a little less helpful.  

3 stars for the dessert and appetizers, 2 off for the pasta, an Italian staple and a must get right for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised as I heard from my friend that the food was really salty. It wasn't. 

Food was beautifully plated. Small position size, but I left full in the end. Definitely need apps with mains if you are moderately to fully hungry. Waiter was very knowledgable with the menu. Recommended some awesome signature dishes. I asked him to choose between two dishes and I was surprised that he didn't recommend the pricier one! The ingredients of dishes are unique with duck internal organs and lamb brain to order. My water was literally never empty! Every time I turned, there was someone refilling! 

Dishes: 
Nodini: knotted bread -signature dish. It looked cool, but it was so-so in taste. Too hard for me. 
Cervello: Lamb's brain wrapped in prosciutto. I didn't really like this. Lamb's Brain taste weird. Not my thing. 
Melanzane (eggplant): my fave app. Eggplant was delicious
Bigoli: this was pretty good! I was wary about the duck insides, but it was tasty! 
Gnocchi: my friend had this. It was good, but small she said. Wasn't very hearty. 
Tiramisu: this was ok. Nothing special. I've had better tiramisu, but it was cool that they glazed the top with Espresso, like they do with creme brûlée. 
Cookie baggy: this was cute! 


Overall, I was generally surprised with this place. It's not as pricey as splendido, but the dining experience definitely felt like it since I wasn't expecting a cute cookie bag to take with or the sous chef to come and explain our dishes to us. I was more expecting a gusto type place where they just put the dishes on the table. So this was a good mimic of a fine dining place without the Over the top expensive bill.  I give this place an A-!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her birthday and I have to say I haven't had this high quality dining experience for a very long time. From the moment we walked in, we were treated extremely well. We were seated by the entrance and when we asked to move to another table because of the cold draft, they were so accomodating. 

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the interesting dishes on the menu. He was also very helpful in pairing wines with our meal. We started with a bruschetta with warm fresh ricotta and figs. We knew right away when we tasted it that we were in for a superb meal.

As we waited for our selections to arrive, we felt very relaxed in the casual open dining area. Our waiter checked on us from time to time which was nice.

Our food arrived within a reasonable time. I had the sea bass with lentils with a beautiful glass of floral Pino Nero from Abbazia Di Novacella. My daughter had ravioli stuffed with goose. The guys both had a polenta dish with fall off the bone brisket served on a wooden board. All dishes were amazing. The flavours were intense and worked together perfectly. This is when food is art not just nourishment. This is fine dining not just a quick bite. This is food you savour and remember long after the evening is over. 

But wait. It wasn't over yet. This was a birthday celebration. We were going for the dessert menu! Just a few items but they all looked interesting. My husband couldn't decide so asked our waiter from heaven, Steven, to choose one for him. He brought Sanguinaccio. It certainly wasn't one I would have have chosen given one of the main ingredients was pig's blood but when I had a taste, it was delicious. I'm serious! Just shows you should try to keep an open mind about food. This happens to be a very traditional Italian specialty.

I would have to say this was a perfect evening."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and both times very satisfied. 

The service is excellent and really attentive. Our server also made great recommendations. 

This latest adventure we got pig ears, lamb brains, and bread knots. The pig ears were pig ears. The lamb brains and knots were super tasty. 

For entrees we got the duck egg pasta and the pork blood pasta and both were delicious. The servers also explain each dish beforehand.

Dessert we shared the pork blood gnache tart and it had a rich flavour. My date was full before dessert but once she tasted this all of a sudden she was hungry again.

Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"2nd visit to Buca in a few months. Did a walk-in at 5pm when they open and were seated without difficulty on a Thursday. The place filled in later and was busy.

Went with three people. Bill came to about $550 so around 180 per person with wine and cocktails.

It was a perfect meal! Had the prosciutto with lamb brains, horse carpaccio, a plate of delicious meats and cheeses, the ricotta gnocchi with fermented butter and truffles.

The sorbets are made in a pacojet, and an interesting \"Parmesan\" flavour was delicious, as was the clementine.

Their version of a tiramisu was good, but I prefer more traditional recipes.

Wine suggestions were excellent.  Service great.

FLAWLESS VICTORY"}
{"text":"Solid service for a group of 10 people. We had a set menu family style. Dishes were simplistic but so delicious and tasty. Notable items were the pizza, very thin and crispy perfection. The steak was also cooked to impeccable standards. We didn't feel rushed at all during our dinner service. Enjoyed every minute of the dinner."}
{"text":"Buca is a basement restaurant and the entrance is at the back of the building - easy to miss due to the construction. Anyway, food was delicious. Being a fan of  Bar Buca, the same qualities apply -  impressive dishes with surprising and new flavor combinations that manage to give that 'wow' factor in every bite.

My favorite of the night was the asparagus salad. The texture of the spaghetti was good and interesting too, especially when I'm not a huge pasta fan. Tiramisu was creamy & heavy, a twist on the classic dessert."}
{"text":"Italian food was my favorite kind of food for the longest time. If I hadn't been introduced to pho, it still would be. Regardless, it's still in the top three. Pasta will never be something I don't enjoy, and the flavors and textures and overall fillingness of Italian food is why it's still and always will be one of the worlds most global cuisines.

Buca is located on King St just off the main strip, near Portland. Follow the old school European pathway and you'll find it on the right hand side in a submerged basement level loft style room. With the brick and steel accents and high ceilings, the place just ruminates class. 

The service is excellent. Our server in particular was extremely attentive and prompt with menus, water, and bringing us our food. My friend and I had our meals within 5-7 minutes of placing our order.

I ordered the 'Bigioli' which is duck egg pasta in a rose style sauce. Perfectly plated and arranged, I almost felt bad taking a bite as it was almost like a piece of art the way it was presented instead of food. If I had one complaint, it was the serving size which was about the same measurement as a tennis ball. For $21 I'd have expected to get more, but the quality and flavor were very good. My friend got the pizza, and she was blown away by the taste. Said it was the best pizza she'd ever had, and she hasn't had pizza since because it wouldn't own up to Buca. Not a bad compliment.

The last thing I'll comment on is the price. I get that it's King West, I get that it's Buca and high end, I get that eating out costs money. And this definitely has more to do with my favorite foods mostly happen to be affordable (pho, Chinese, fast foods like pizza), but for a pizza, pasta and two glasses of wine it was $82. I can't complain, it was paid for by work using a gift card I'd won at a holiday party so I can't complain, but I'd be reticent to go back paying on my own dollar, especially since when I got home I had to eat leftovers to make up for the lack of food I had here. Still, the crowd this restaurant services is one who's bankroll most likely eclipses mine, so maybe they only lose half points!

Worth going to. Good food and service, but I miss the old Italian places where they had laminated menus on parchment lapsed with Fettuccini Alfredo and Linguine Marsala on the menu. 

Check it out. Bring your bosses Amex card"}
{"text":"When the family and I went to get dinner at Buca, we were pretty giddy with anticipation. My younger brother, a true lover of food, had hyped this place up and read up on it. When we parked our car and walked through the snazzy neighborhood, we found Buca was bumping. Despite the crowd, we were seated quickly and our waiter began to tell us a bit about the specials for the day. 

I think the quality of the bread you get as a starter at italian restaurants is an indicator of things to come. In the case of Buca, the bread was delicious, and so we knew we had chosen the right place. We also ordered some cured pork sausage appetizer, which I'm forgetting the name of, but was delicious. For the entrees, we went  around the table and got different types of dishes. I had the Pansotti and my brother had some Pancetta pizza. My dad ordered the Angello Arrosto, the lamb on this dish was cooked to perfection. My mom ordered the seared cod, which was once again, amazing. I think it's a testament to the place that such a wide variety of dishes were executed so well. I think it has a great vibe for a family dinner or a date, or even a night with some friends. 

We ended the night with gelato, because we were famished and my family loves good food. Overall, made my family's trip to Toronto that much better. I'll remember to return when I visit canada once more."}
{"text":"My family went to Buca for my mom's birthday, and we had a great experience. The service was wonderful, every person we encountered was polite, attentive, and it was perfectly paced - they were always around to fill water and top up drinks, but never obtrusive. 

We started with the nodini (garlic knots) which were great, and the carpaccio piemontese, which was unreal. There was a great combination of flavour with the cinnamon cap mushroom and fermented garlic. 

Most of my family had the spaghetti al Nero di maiale, which was pork blood pasta with smoked burrata cheese. It was spicy and delicious. 

Buca has great food, great service, and a great atmosphere, I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We went there for my boyfriend's birthday. We ordered the charcuterie board, appetizers and main course. Great food, service and drinks. They also surprised us with a freshly made pasta dish at the end as a birthday gift."}
{"text":"bigoli is the food you must try... awesome."}
{"text":"This is a tough review. You might like this place more if you are looking for an Italian place that is more off the wall than Italian.

While I accepted the odd flavours and choices (lamb brains, truffle pizza, etc), as well as the complete lack of more traditional Italian choices, I felt that...

1. The vibe was cool. You feel like you are going to have a good meal here, even if you don 't.
2. The portions are small. I had a scallop pasta that was puny and lacking in flavour.
3. The service is average. While we were served in a timely manner, our wine bottle and cocktails were removed from the table before we were finished with them.
4. The prices are high. This is fine, but it did not stand out as one of the better 100$ meals I have had in Toronto. Expect to pay 100$ per person with an appetizer, entree, and wine. Maybe more."}
{"text":"Went for my adult children's birthday. Great atmosphere and service but food mediocre - my view is that for price point why not have exceptional like canoe or scaramouche - neither of which make you PDF in your credit card to hold a reservation. Think it is overrated for price category."}
{"text":"Buca is a lovely intimate space to celebrate any special event. The space is a great blend between industrial, rustic and upscale aesthetics. We had great service and our waitress was very helpful with recommendations.

We came over the holidays to celebrate a birthday and had a great adventurous meal. You can definitely come across items that can't be found anywhere else! We started the night with Salumi De Buca and we got the lardo, spalla and the salsiccine. It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream. Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top. The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello. It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. It was a fun dish.

Of course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from. The table next to us had some younger kids and the kitchen was able to accommodate making simple pastas for them."}
{"text":"When dining at a high-end spot, you'll typically encounter a snobbish air from either the other guests, wait staff or both. Some people may go there specifically to add to that type of vibe, but I have always viewed it as a negative. When you're surrounded by people posturing it definitely distracts from the meal (even if the food is great).

However, Buca is the exception! Great blend of low key/ chill atmosphere, yet still providing excellent customer service and amazing food.

We didn't have reservations, so we sat at the bar in the back room. It was a nice though because the bartender struck up some good conversation in between our ordering. The staff was so prompt and attentive. We had at least 3 different workers check on us throughout the night to make sure we were taken care of. It was late on a Sunday night, so it wasn't crowded or noisy. Just very relaxing. 

The food was really great quality. We did it family styled, and tried a few different meals. Everything put out was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Definitely worth shoveling out the big bucks! ha 

An all around great experience!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS AMAZING - Been here a ton of times and never a disappointment.
The Snail pasta and just about every pizza are to die for! Lambs brains and piggs ears are great too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, extensive wine selection, good ambience and delicious food. Finally a restaurant in King West that I would go back for. Not only it's famous, their food are extraordinary and fantastic. Reasonably priced and portions are good as well. There are many things to order suitable for everyone.  If you are more adventurous you could try their lamb brain deep fried, or their knotted bread, olives etc are simply delicious as well. Their pasta dishes are divine.  Must also order their desserts to finish off an awesome meal!  Would recommend everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"No fresh bread in an Italian restaurant? Also, the pasta itself was too tough and hard, almost like chewing on raw dough. The pig blood pasta and the squid pasta was painfully spicy. The lemon gelato was too acidic. Maybe they just don't want Asians to come back and were trying to f us over, but at least the best part of the meal was the small pizza we got as a side dish to the horse meat tartar. Their pizza is good, but I bet I could cook pasta better than them."}
{"text":"Buca was pretty underwhelming. We were here for my birthday last July, and for my husband's birthday in January 2016. I really enjoyed the bread knots and pork blood pasta, but the carbonara was low on flavour and the pig's ears we're way, way, way too salty. The cocktails were okay.

I'm wondering if we missed the boat. Perhaps it used to be really good but now it's turning into corporate food? (i.e. offends no one)"}
{"text":"Come here for a nice date, special occasion, or just because you're the man/woman and want to treat yourself to an awesome meal

-Great wine selection 
-CHARCUTERIE - They have amazing meat and cheese 
-Home made pastas (home made everything actually)
-Wonderful environment
-Waitstaff treat you like a king/queen

I arrived early and was waiting for my date, so the bar tender helped me choose what kind of wine to order. Before I even asked for his help he was asking me what kind of wine I was looking for (Red or White) and started guiding me through the wine list. I ended up choosing the Spumente because I love sparkling wines, and it was perfectly refreshing and a wonderful way to start the meal.

We got a cheese and charcuterie board to start, with a bread basket. He ordered the Duck Egg Pasta, while I got the Tortellini. Everything tasted amazingly fresh and was clearly made in house. Portions are small so you don't feel overly full afterwards.

The tiramisu was our dessert but it was just O.K., nothing special so I would recommend you try something else instead of that.

Overall a wonderful dining experience--better than some other pricey restaurants in Toronto like Canoe. We can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"normally, you can find italian food at every corner in toronto. this place is really exceptional, serving traditional italian food with a real trendy and upscale swing. delicious food, great service and very cool atmosphere. great wine recommendations too. great dinner if you're looking to splurge a bit."}
{"text":"Well had heard from my friend that this was the best Italian in the city.  

I was very excited.  It didn't take long after arriving to realise that this wasn't up my alley.  Their menu is very weird or uses unusual ingredients.  actually ingredients that not long ago were considered low end.   Beef tongue,  lamb brains, beef heart tartare and blood sausage!  Why try and make inferior cuts edible.  Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants?  Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it.  Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle.   Barely brown on the outside.   Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all.   I have had way better and at half the price.   The pizza was tasty,  but some of them are as much as $25,  seems crazy to me.

Not a very good meal,  and I certainly won't be going back or sending anyone I know there.   Definitely over rated and hyped.   There is way better Italian in Toronto than this."}
{"text":"Love this place,! One of my favs 

Great food( new menu everyday) 
Great staff ( very knowledgeable) 

And it the perfect place for both bigger parties and private dining."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the last few years, sometimes with family, other times with friends, and occasionally with a work-related guest.  It's always been good, sometimes bordering on very good. Thursday night it was great. Flawless really. 

The evening started well, when I ducked in out of the rain, a bit early, and settled down to wait for a friend who had booked our table.  Immediately I was greeted and made to feel at home, and offered a glass of wine -- I chose Il Nero from the \"enoteca\" by the glass list -- a great blend of negroamaro and cabernet sauvignon from Pugiia.  Getting to speak in Italian to the charming waiter, who was from Capri (are people really FROM Capri? I guess so), helped set the mood.  It was relatively early, and the large dining room was starting to fill up.  Good people watching, but even ore fun to watch the wait staff getting their instructions for the evening  from Chef Gentile, and gazing at the various stations in the open kitchen.  

Soon after my friend arrived (and tucked into his glass of the Nero), we opted to go for the spring tasting menu, a menu innovation I had not noticed on past visits.  This proved to be a smart choice -- good value, yes at $75, but a fantastic way for Gentile to show off his take on exciting Italian regionalism.  As we sipped our wine, we were treated to three stuzzichini, single bite morsels that came out in a perfect pace from the kitchen:  lemon ricotta on a parmesan crisp, a fried gnocchi with cheese, and a baked flax seed racker with a speck of savoury topping.  We changed wine, opting on the waiter's advise for a very unusual white -- a ribbola gialla from Friuli -- a dry very flavourful wine with an almost orange hue.  This was a splendid accompaniment for the next course, a \"pesto di Modena,\" which turned out to be delightful dollops of whipped wild boar lardo, spiced marcona almond, with bits of okanagan peach and pembina berry.  The fruit both cutting the richness of the lardo and playing beautifully of the wine we were drinking. Happily, we each had a quarter glass of the ribbola left when the burrata arrived, house-made and served with olive oil and, in an inspired touch, a small piece of cured sardine whose saltiness and pickle was a great contarst to the creaminess of the cheese.

Knowing that the next course was a platter of salumi, we moved back to red wine, both of us knowing with consultation that we needed to get back the Nero to fully enjoy the cured meats (which also came with a lamb's brain saltimbocca and a sizeable pile of crispy pig's ears.  I had seen the brains on the menu before, and kicked myself for not having ordered them in the last -- this is a dish worth stopping in for on its own.  pancetta wrapped around creamy brain, a divine contrast of salt, porcine taste, creamy brain, and to follow it with a mouthful of the Nero truly perfect.  Among the salumi selections the soprasotta stood out, as did the fennel salami.  Buca makes them all on premises, and the meats are exceptional. 

The next dish was an old favourite, one that I have ordered on most of my past visits, so it was nice meeting an old familiar friend -- Spaghetti al Nero di Miale -- something close to this restaurant's signature dish.  It's a small, but at this point in the meal perfectly-sized, pile of hand-cut pork blood pasta, n'duja sausage (a Calabrian specialty), wild ramps (not always included but a seasonal nod) and smoked burrata cheese.  Spicy and beautifully textured, and paving the way for the final substantive course, and the main one: Angello Arosto.  A few slice of roasted featherstone lamb loin with a ragu bianco, a small amount of sheep's milk ricotta with churned honey, and roasted king oyster mushrooms. The lamb here handled with consummate skill by the kitchen.

We rounded out our meal with a dolcetto - this may change evening to evening but for us it was a shot glass with a  moscato and a citrus foam, and I may have detected a few grains of bee pollen atop, but this is a guess as the menu card was silent on this score. This was followed by a Florentine classic, a zuccotto, a dome of striped cake with favours of gianduia, chocolate, and frangelico topped with a bit of cream.

A perfect evening.  Hats off to Chef Gentile and his crew.  Five starts easily  (the first time I've felt so moved in my ranking).  As I said to my friend when we were finishing, if Michelin started awarding stars in Canada, here in Toronto Buca certainly gets one."}
{"text":"Dinner at BUCA fantastic... House cured Charcuterie, local cheeses. Burratta truffle pizza off the charts. They serve the pizzas whole and you slice them with a scissors. Start off the meal with fried eggplant and nodini!!!

The ambience is warm and wonderful and brings you back to Italy.
All Italian wine list makes for interesting discoveries.

Kale salad also a favorite and we all love the tiramisu but the egg nog ice cream was off the charts....

we had a big group of twelve so we had a whole long table to ourselves. Perfect evenning!"}
{"text":"Buca sets a new bar for what a restaurant should be.
Quaint, modern, delicious, and different, it delivers a perfect evening.

First off, the menu is varied and has a perfect mix of trusty standby's and interesting twists. Everything delivered was exceptional quality, delicious and perfectly timed. The drinks are well made and have a definite italian twist.

The service was some of the best I've seen with everyone going out of their way to ensure you enjoy yourself.

Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"delicious! Big fan of everything we got, especially the bread and goose/squash stuffed ravioli! Tiramisu was different than what I'm used to and was much better!
Look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner at Buca.

It was a very hot early evening in Toronto, so we decided to dine inside. After walking down the stairs to the host stand, we got seated in the inner, lower level of the restaurant. We ended up ordering:

Fried zucchini blossoms: I love these, and always end up ordering this when I see it on the menu (small portion, though, with only two blossoms to an order)

Charcuterie board: we ended up picking prosciutto and two salamis, which were all made in house (we walked past the hanging hams and salamis on our way to our table)

Nodini bread: these bread knots were really good, though the bread is a little hard on the outside

Fusilli with tomato and anchovy: couldn't really taste the anchovy, but the pasta was nicely cooked

Scallops with guanciale, peas and yogurt sauce: this was my favorite dish that we ordered. I always like well-cooked scallops, and the yogurt sauce was an interesting and tasty surprise with the scallops

On top of the really good food, our server was very professional and personable throughout te meal. I would return to Buca if I am in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Get the tasting menu. 

We ate an ark full of animals.  

From geese to wild boars.   Pig ears served alongside lamb brains.

Quite possibly the most enjoyable dining experience we've ever had in Toronto.

Like an edible version of the Metro Toronto Zoo.    But with cake. 

(And what cake!   Just when we thought it couldn't get better, out popped a delicious version of some fancypants Italian cake that dropped our animal-filled jaws to the floor. )"}
{"text":"oh.em.gee.
food - phenomenal. I wish I remembered what I ordered though. I just remember that there were lots of flavours and I want to come back."}
{"text":"This was a great expierience. Food was fantastic same with the service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a reservations on a Satuday night and the place was packed though it slowed down later in the night. We tried the special tasting menu which is like a 8 course meal! The service and the presentation was excellent. Loved everythin on the menu. The Nodinis were excellent. The pizza with Gorgonzola cheese and hedgehog mushrooms was just fantastic. The give you scissors to cut the pizza!! They also had this dual chamber pasta with foie gras which was very interesting. The other dishes were equally as good. Must try for the experience."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. The best thing place has going for it is the exceptionally maintained level of service from checking your coat to ordering the bill. They really set the bar high on customer accommodation.

As for the food... There's something to be said when you walk out of a restaurant like this and you're chowing down on tacos 30 minutes later because you are still hungry and already $200 light in your pocket. 

We sampled the following (among a various wine offerings):

GNOCCHI AL POMODORO CRUDO
hand rolled ricotta dumplings, fresh tomato sauce, pesto genovese, fermented butter
- I do not recommend at all. Bland. Boring. Small Portion. High Price...

BEEF SHORT RIBS
- This was the best meal of the night by far. I would have this again, highly recommend it. 

CHARCUTERIE BOARD
- This was good, but they delivered the board to the table barely empty. I thought there more was on the way, but I was wrong...

Everything that hit our table had a story appended to it. The staff seemed very passionate about their craft and the food they offer. But I think I will stick to Bar Buca should I offer up my patronage in the future."}
{"text":"Been here 5-6 times now

love the drinks- bar buca cocktail is my absolute fave. it has this beet-infused vodka, olive oil...really unique/good

food is good

service isn't good though. very slow and last time i was there they forgot to put in a food order until i reminded them like an hour later. takes forever for them to make/serve the drinks too. 

coffee here isn't bad either

love the ambience- dimly lit, nice."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time with a friend. I first heard about this place from Jamie Oliver (via Twitter) when he visited Toronto. It took me a while to finally check it out. Needless to say I had high hopes going in. 

I had the gnocco fritti which was a fried dumping and it came with slices of pancetta. The server told me the idea is to make sandwiches out of them. It was good but a little salty. That didn't stop me from cleaning the plate. 

My friend decided to be a lot more adventurous and ordered cervello which was fried lamb brains which came with a caper agliata.  I tried a piece and it was also pretty salty. But not wto salty to eat. 

Then I had the spaghetti carbonara. When it arrived at the table an egg yolk sat at the top of a mound of pasta. The server then punctured the yolk and mixed the pasta for me. That was kind of cool. The pasta itself was a perfect al dente. I've never had pasta this well cooked before.  It was great. 

My experience here was awesome. Both food and service were delivered at a high level. I wasn't necessarily blown away by the food but it was good food done really really well. Given that I came in with high expectations that's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from this, specially after realizing how hard it is to get a reservation during the weekends. Finally we spontaneously went there on a Tuesday nigh with no reservation.  Here is my review
We were politely welcomed and overall the service was great.  The location and atmosphere are also charming. The food however is far from being special in short is falling short from being ordinary but with a nice presentation . We ordered plater of cheese and meat and another spritzer with brain of lam. Presentation was perfect but taste was laking. The brain appetizer was nice but over salty. The pasta dishes were a huge turn-off. I came back from Tuscany few weeks a go and was hoping to get a re-taste of great pasta dishes , we I was let down. The pasta was taste less and barely eatable. For desert I ordered Pana cotta, it was not that. It was wiped cream combined with home made jam; ok but easily forgettable. The 3 stars is many gained because of service and location not the food."}
{"text":"Wow. My boyfriend, his mom, and I are from out of town and stumbled into this place. Our very personable waitress recomended the meat tasting platter, we chose to taste the horse, the goose, and the pork sausage. All incredible and my first time trying horse, which we were informed was usually cured for two years (!) in their in-house charcuterie before serving. The sausage stuffed olives were amazing as well. For my main dish I got the gnocci, which was incredibly light and fluffy. The lobster ravioli and the pork blood pasta were both also great. Desert was perhaps my favorite, I usually hate pistachio and even liked the pistachio cake they brought my boyfriend. I ordered the Tiramisu and some coffee. Their take on Tiramisu, a dish which usually leaves something to be desired, was fantastic. Rich, creamy textures served in a cup rather than in a cake. Amazing. I am a big coffee fan and even their coffee was pretty great. The little cookie at the end was the perfect cherry on top. Food aside the atmosphere and decor was modern yet intimate. I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and quality service. Please note there was no bread service. That was somewhat of a disappointment given its Italian flare. Salads were excellent, albeit the vinaigrette was slightly too acidic. Their veal dish was incredibly tender and had impeccable flavour. That being said, the price per weight seemed excessive. Wines by the glass were skimpy, but select cocktails were pleasant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We finally got to Buca (King W, Toronto) for my Birthday. 

I'm so happy that we did, you can tell they take prides in what they serve there. Every little detail is known by the staff so you feel like you're getting the experience of passion, and a unique dish. 

After requesting our servers top picks (as I always do) she insisted that we allow the kitchen to choose for us (umm.. maybe on another budget lady $55 for a personal pizza, maybe if you're buying) and then suggested we pair something from every section of the menu, followed by an entree each. (Really, who eats like this?) I felt slightly annoyed by her lack of flexibility with recommendations. 

My BF and I shared the 'PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE' ($16) it was mouth watering and I LOVED it, he thought it 'was good but didn't blow his mind' I would recommend trying it but it's not a huge portion so, perfect for two.

I originally went thinking I would try the 'gnocchi' as it came highly recommended but, our server mentioned that the menu had just changed so it would most likely be a different one and suggested I go for something 'different.'  I agreed so I went with what she described as a house favourite. 

I ended up with the 'BIGOLI' ($24) torchio extruded pasta, duck offal ragu, Venetian spices, mascarpone, basil. It was rich (comparable to a thicker cream based sauce), I liked it but wouldn't order again. Personally, it felt liked pasta and blended cream sauce. I need something added for texture/ variety. I didn't personally wow me, especially in contrast to his entree which was the 'CRESC'TAJAT' ($28) we both preferre. The pasta with octopus, mussels and tomato base was phenomenal!! I had plate envy the entire time, watching him grab different bites lol. 

Anyway I can't complain not a morsel of food was left from any of our 3 dishes, and we were seriously stuffed to the brim. 

Next, I need to try their branzino, gnocchi & pizza! 

Definitely, can be on the pricey side if you add a bottle of wine, two entrees and an app to share (our bill came to $160 ish) forgot to mention, instead of your typical dessert that restaurants usually give you for your Birthday they gave us a pasta dish take home and two small cookies"}
{"text":"We were here for an 8pm dinner on Valentine's day. Our cold dishes were very good but our hot dishes were served at room temperature. The pasta in particular was muddy and pasty, but by the time we raised the issue (i.e., both of us were being polite) it was too late, and most of the small serving was gone. In all fairness the pasta was taken off the bill, and a free dessert was offered; but we did not want dessert. What we wanted was a perfect meal for the occasion, and for the price. Will not be back for a long time, if ever. Have had better experiences at Buca Yorkville."}
{"text":"Best pasta I've had in Toronto. Everything you order is fresh, inventive and delicious! If you're lucky to grab a table (they fill up FAST), you will not regret it!

The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it's a bit on the pricey side, and I'm not as big a fan on the appetizers. The portion size is also on the small side - if you're hungry, you'll likely need to order an appetizer and/or dessert. 

However, I've never tasted a pasta there I didn't love, and I still fantasize about the Spaghetti Carbonara. If you're in the good for fresh, homemade Italian pasta, go now!

I also really like the decor - the outdoor patio feels like you are in an italian piazza, with brick walls all around. A great summer evening restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Buca was extremely disappointing. I came here tonight with my two friends and we were extremely surprised as to how amazing the reviews are here. We ordered $130 of food with no drinks 3 entries and 1 appetizer so we were pretty pissed at our wallets being $130 light with terrible food and service. I've never minded spending money on food - as long as it serves up to it, but Buca did not. Our food was horrible and the pizza my friend had was the worst pizza shes had. 

The service was good (when they were quick to take our coats) but our waiter was extremely rude up until we had to pay for our bill (she wanted a good tip). 

I am so extremely disappointed in this restaurant especially with all the hype going around about it. I will not be back here and to all of you who are debating on \"enjoying\" some dinner who don't bother. You'll be $100 lighter and starving when you walk out that door. 

Ps. The pictures I've uploaded might look good but don't be fooled!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience! Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful service, and a spectacular meal. Extensive wine list and delicious cocktails. The gnocchi was to die for. Will definitely stop by again if I am ever in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came here on my last night in Toronto on a business trip on a recommendation. The venue and decor was very nice, a sort of classy hipster feel and underground. I ordered the bigoli pasta (pasta with duck egg). I got a complimentary 2 pieces of silician chickpea bread. The pasta was innovative, tasted like the duck eggs I had for Chinese breakfast at home. I asked for a side of tomato sauce for more tangy marinara flavor and they brought it as well. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is the most overrated restaurant I've been in Toronto. Born in an Italian family, with an Italian nonna who was a second-generation baker, I feel I can say: no, this is not Italian food done right, I am so sorry. 

The good things: the service is impeccable. The restaurant may be packed, but they will treat you like the only customer, like someone very special, like if you were the only person there. A sommelier will recommend you wines, the servers will explain every detail on how the dishes were prepared, it's really amazing how they are trained and attentive. Incredible. 

Then I ordered an appetizer, the cheese board. 19 dollars for tiny little pieces of cheese, paired with preserves. I was asked if I wanted bread. Sure, yes, I wanted bread! But you have to PAY EXTRA 4.50 for a bread basket. Wait, what? Ok, I can do that. The bread came, it was... just regular bread. Nothing magical. Simple bread, 4.50. Ridiculous. 

Wait, it becomes worse. It's an italian restaurant. I expect bread and olive oil. I asked for olive oil, a staple of italian cuisine. I was informed they would call the SOMMELIER to offer me, for 5 dollars, the extra olive oil. Is that some kind of joke??????  No thanks, I just wanted to soak my bread in olive oil. 

My main course was a fish. It was the saddest fish plate I've ever ordered. For 36 bucks I expected some fancy presentation, sides, something special. It was just a fish fillet, with aromatic olives and olive oil (the very expensive olive oil I mentioned before). No sides. Not even some rice or salad. Nothing at all. A SINGLE FISH FILLET. 

My husband ordered smart and had the pizza, which is HUGE and DELICIOUS. If you ever go there, order the pizza. Totally worth the price an can be shared! It's al taglio, the size of a 17 inch notebook, thin crust, homemade sauce, everything you expected and much more. I had some, was delighted! Also, water buffalo meatballs with WATER BUFFALO MOZZARELLA, you WANT THAT. 

Dessert was much better! Their Tiramisu is SPECTACULAR, I could eat that forever, and my husband ordered the affogatto with some delicious gelato from outer space. I'm not a fan of gelato, but that was really incredible. I loved the dessert! 

Overall, I was very disappointed with the mains, which is the most important part of a meal. I saw people ordering pasta and they were basically a few pieces of pasta. They also need to work on presentation. People like food porn. 

I wouldn't come back to spend 200 bucks in a place that doesn't refill my bread basket and doesn't offer me olive oil, then charges me almost 40 bucks for a sad fish fillet. They need desperately to work on their menu. For THE REAL ITALIAN VIBE, please refer to Alimento, a few blocks away. They do it right. The place is always full of italians for some reason. The guys know their stuff. Buca? Meh."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine, overpriced, ridiculously poor service. 

At the bar first, 5 drinks=120 dollars. Completely nuts.

I have never had a lag of almost 2 hours between courses, anywhere in Toronto, anywhere in the world. Told that the food is coming, time and time again. No explanation why we were waiting for such a long time. In their defence, they comped us our mains, but only after I walked over to the most managerial-looking fellow (who was very polite) and explained our situation. I feel they should have offered without my asking.

Food itself was very well done, but a 30 dollar plate of pasta should not be sized as a second of four courses. To get yourself a proper-sized meal, one would have to order a salad, a starter, a plate of pasta and a \"carne\" plate, To do so would make Buca one of Toronto's most expensive restaurants. 

At around 9ish, the clientele began to change....Jersey Shore-esque (girls in microskirts and heels, heavily-scented dudes with GIANT watches, T-Shirts with Boss logos, etc). 

Do not eat here. Go to Enoteca Sociale or Terroni and save yourself a couple hundred bucks."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  A world class Italian restaurant.  Zoey, our server was terrific, knowledgeable and made sure we had a great evening.

We are from Ohio and have traveled extensively worldwide.

All I can say us WOW.

THANKS."}
{"text":"I tried their pasta for dinner and it tasted undercooked. The atmosphere is beautiful but I had higher expectations for the quality of the food. I've had better Italian food elsewhere in the city. Service was ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend always has to have at least one Italian meal on any given trip we go on, and our week-long adventure in Toronto was no exception. After failing to secure a reservation at a different Italian restaurant, we were able to obtain one at Buca. While my boyfriend had low expectations, I held none. After all, Buca sits at the top of many \"best\" lists for Toronto.

Needless to say, my boyfriend was wowed and thoroughly enjoyed it. I really liked Buca as well, but I didn't quite find my dish of Spaghetti al Nero di Maiale quite as flavorful as Buca's infamous Bigoli, which is what my boyfriend ordered. 

While the portions in Yelp photos look abysmal in portion size, in person, it's more than you would think - especially for the price you're paying. Anywho, I thought my pasta's texture was perfect, as was my boyfriend's. I had debated between getting the Bigoli and Spaghetti al Nero di Maiale, and went with the latter, since I would get to steal a bite from my boyfriend. I do wish I had gotten the Bigoli after trying his.

So, if you don't want any regrets, get the Bigoli. It was delicious. We also got the Gnocco Fritto and Nodini as starters. The Nodini in Yelp photos appear large, but are actually deceivingly small in person. I would say they're about the size of a ping-pong ball. They were a bit on the crusty side, when I had anticipated a softer bread. I would much prefer softer than what they ended up serving. I didn't find them to be anything spectacular as I could have made more flavorful bread knots at home.

The Gnocco Fritto was okay. The menu describes them as \"crisped dumplings,\" but they're actually just giant puffs made from dough. \"Dumplings\" is inaccurate in all regards for this particular dish. It was mildly sweet and extremely greasy. And the lardo was the only thing that made it somewhat better-tasting. I wouldn't recommend either of these dishes. 

While I liked my pasta, everything else was lacking. The service was slow, and refills on water took too long. We were also seated at a very cramped table between two larger parties, so it was a bit awkward, as there was only 6 inches at most between the tables. I might as well have been sitting in the other diners' laps. 

There was also a birthday party in the same room, so it was extremely loud and incredibly hard to have a conversation at any speaking volume, except yelling. It was also dark and hot. There were plenty of other tables we could have been seated at, but we walked right by them to be seated in the back. I guess the back room is meant to be a more intimate and romantic atmosphere, but it was really just the opposite when you're breaking personal space boundaries. 

There was no sense of privacy in conversations because the neighboring tables could pretty much hear everything. And you also end up making awkward eye contact. I don't particularly enjoy having personal conversations with strangers. 

I would come back for the pasta, but nothing else. And I would recommend asking for seating out in the daylight, where you can actually see what you're eating and have a semblance of a chance to have a semi-private, normal speaking volume conversation.

Overall: 3/5
Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 1/5
Service: 1/5"}
{"text":"I wonder if Hannibal Lecter eats here?

Lamb brains, anyone?

Sensing my curiosity, the charming waiter talked me into it by saying that it was \"just a tiny bite\".

Well, a tiny bite it wasn't.  In fact, two egg-roll sized, bacon-wrapped \"lamb brains\" showed up, with a side of (I think) pesto sauce.  

It tasted like...monk fish liver.  

If you don't think about what you're eating...it's not off-putting at all.  I'm glad I tried it...and it's now at the top of the \"the weirdest things I've eaten\" list, replacing kangaroo meat pizza (those Australians weren't kidding).

Anyway - aside from that, I'd highly recommend the pig ears - a bit addicting, though too salty for my taste.

I'd skip the pig blood spaghetti - chewy, but no sense in paying $22 for pure shock value in food.

As for wine, if you like full bodied reds without tannins, try the 2011 Montalbera Ruchè di Castagnole Monferrato L'Accento.  Smooth!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences going out I have ever had . Called ahead, made reservations under my name, and got seated at a table with some other couple, including a loudmouth drunk who it seemed had never been to a restaurant before. Asked if I can get a more private table and the maître d' said \"well yeah, but it could be an hour.\" We said fuck it and went across the street to gusto"}
{"text":"Pomodoro e Tartufo Pizza - my death row meal.

Simplicity at it's finest, no tricks, no gimmicks, just simple ingredients that shine - thin crust, tomato sauce, truffled burrata, fresh basil, shaved black truffles. Perfection.

If I ever meet a woman as perfect as this pizza, I will marry her on the spot. 

I'd love her so much I'd die for her. Scratch that, I'd kill for her. Con Air Nicholas Cage style circa 1997. 

And sitting on death row, the only thing I'd look forward to is my weekly conjugal visit with my perfect wife and my last pizza.

It's ok, I'd die happy.

If you don't love this pizza, we would never be friends.

Everything else here is pretty awesome too - the pasta, salumi, desserts, drinks, service - all top notch. They push the nodini pretty hard but go for the gnocco fritto instead, your mouth will thank you.

I'd have Rob Gentile's baby for the culinary benefits."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write this review for sometime though I've never really been able to put my experience into proper words. Buca is basically a really good looking hang out and if you're looking to grab a drink, maybe some apps and you're a local to the area this is probably going to be your go-to hangout spot. Some positives first, the restaurant is small but pretty nice, all tables require stools so if you have someone in your party that's in a wheelchair they will feel left out. The cooks are working really hard to belt out the food as quickly as possible while trying to retain the high standards in quality and presentation.

Now the negatives... Servers here are the worst I've ever seen and I've been a server for 4 years. They are fairly friendly but I've never experienced serving staff that don't know how to serve. Servers here don't know how to multi task and it took 3 servers in 3 separate passes to clean one table. I counted the number of servers and how many tables the establishment had and each server only had 3 - 4 tables (4 servers in total) which is far less than most establishments yet they couldn't remember drink orders, meal orders and were certainly not under any kind of pressure to expedite food in a timely manner. One table stayed empty and a mess for 20 minutes before it was finally cleaned and re-sat. I watched one server take the bill from the table while another cleaned off all the glasses and dishes, a few minutes later a different server slowly wiped down the table and 10 minutes after that another server put fresh cutlery and napkins. We watched as people came in and saw the line and left. If I was the owner I'd want tables turned over as soon as possible, more tables turned over the more money in the owners pocket and more tips for the servers but this concept didn't really resonate with the serving staff because in my opinion they don't really care...

The food itself was underwhelming despite the nice presentation, the drinks were good but took too long to expedite. A simple espresso with liqueur took them nearly 40 minutes to make.

The only person keeping this mess together was the manager who was working hard hosting tables, helping expedite and running part of the bar. But he's only one man and can only do so much. Tip for the restaurant owner, hire experienced servers and cut the dead weight because you could be making much more money. I personally will never good back, but as long as Buca is good to it's local patrons it should be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Was here for an event so the food portion was slightly different, and I also had only hors d'oeuvre, not mains. 

Overall food was delicious, the highlights were the Odini (warm bread knots), Burrata pizza, Orata (raw sea bream). They also created an olive oil gelato for the event i was in. So freaking-ly delicious. It was rich but somehow still refreshing, and it also had a subtle fruitiness and grassiness taste to it. 

Service was pretentious af. Also, as the server was carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvre, I asked to take pic and she AGREED. The moment I started taking pics, she straight up told me \"Can you please hurry up because other people need to eat.\" Lol? Woman, I just started. If you don't want to wait then you could have said no. I did the same to other servers and they weren't bothered by it at all."}
{"text":"Our second visit to Buca this past weekend with fellow foodie friends who were visiting Toronto and Buca delivered yet again !! We went back to the mushroom crostini since we loved it so much last time, glad they still have it on the menu !! This time around I was determined on trying out one of their pizzas, so we ordered the truffled burrata pizza. OMG, what a slice of heaven !!! The only unfortunate part of the experience was that all our mains were served cold. I am sure we would have enjoyed it even more if the mains were served at the right temperature. The gnudi with scallops and ricotta was our least favorite dish. It was quite bland from the inside and I doubt if additional saffron sauce would have rescued this dish. The duck pasta was also one of the other popular dishes of the evening. No sooner had we informed our server about this, the maître d' approached us with dessert menus and offered us some desserts on the house. We quite enjoyed the deconstructed panna cotta and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was quite creamy than I've had at most other places but we still enjoyed it. Talk about customer service, eh?"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a dinner with my friend. We ordered the bruschetta and crispy eggplant to start. The bruschetta was different, but really delicious, as for the eggplant it was delicious- one recommendation would be that it would be warmer when served. As and entrée I had the gnocchi, I was so rich and delicious. Cooked to perfection. We shared the brown butter adffogato as dessert, the ice cream was rich and delicious. 
Overall the experience was great, very expensive, but delicious."}
{"text":"Extremely good. The smoked duck breast and pastas are amazing. Pig ears and lamb brains are unexpectedly good. A must go!"}
{"text":"What can you say about an authentic italian restaurant where the waitstaff all speak Italian?  This place is a must stop.  Chef is a whole animal style chef we did not have the lamb brain it was on the menu!  Great wine selection as well.  We will go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner last Saturday. As we both are foodies, at least once a month we like to go to a recommended place to try the food. I would like to say that Buca definitely did not meet our expectations. 

Service : 5/5 : our host/waiter was really good. He knew the menu really well. He described the dish and flavors very well but I really wish the kitchen had matched his descriptions. 

Cocktails : 5/5 : The cocktails were pretty good. I forgot what I ordered but I know it had Cucumber lavender in it. It was really good.

Food : 2/5 : I was really disappointed by the food they served. I ordered the duck egg pasta and my husband ordered the shrimp pasta. In both the dishes, the pasta was undercooked and the dish was really dry. We could not finish our pasta courses. 

Dessert : 5/5 : The Tiramisu was fantastic! I would say it was one of the best I have had.  My husband ordered the latte and he said the coffee was great too. 

I really wished my food (pasta & main course) experience was as good as the service and the dessert. We live close by and would have loved to have a goto restaurant near by."}
{"text":"Oh my god the bread knots. I had two plates!! The veal agnolotti was good. The dunk tagatelle was amazing. The pizza was also good. I hope they keep up these standards and don't have the post 6 month slip. Go now! Have Jasper or Amelia as your server!"}
{"text":"what a great place, any of the pizzas with buratta cheese on top are worth it. 100%. we got the dumplings too which were ok, but I believe they come with the meat and cheese boards too. overall good experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really gorgeous. I was so excited for a great meal at this restaurant. 

We sat down and ordered our wine and an appetizer (bread knots: more on that later). We spent some time examining the menu. I wasn't thrilled by it -- there were some weird dishes that I wasn't interested in. I'm really pretty open to new foods, but lamb's brain (small plate); pig's blood pasta (pasta); and duck offal (pasta) are just too far for me. 

We both thought the squid ink pasta would be nice. It was also reasonably priced at $28. I wished I had taken a picture of the menu, because the prices were so strange -- I've never eaten at a restaurant with such huge disparities in the price points. Three of the pastas were in the $20 range, and then the next one up was, I think, $40, and then a $60. For pasta. 

The entrees were the same. Two fish dishes at around $30 and then a huge jump up to the $60 and $80 territories. 

Anyway, we thought we'd get the squid ink pasta. So when the server came back, that's what we ordered. But she told us they were out of that. 

I've been to many restaurants. I've never in my life had the server NOT tell me when they were out of a main dish until the moment I ordered. Usually, that's the kind of thing you tell a patron when you hand them the menu.

\"Welcome to Buca, here's your menu. Just to let you know, we're out of the squid ink pasta tonight. I'm so sorry. Take a look and let me know if you have any questions.\"

So we'd been there for 30 minutes, we were getting quite hungry, we had already ordered wine and an appetizer (so we were already in $50), and then you tell us we can't get the dish we wanted?

The server said the next pasta dish on the menu (the one that was twice the price) was also very good and similar to the pasta dish we couldn't order. Yeah, no thanks.

It's just such a bizarre incident. I've never done this in my life. We paid our $50 for wine and appetizers (which were shockingly hard bits of bread swimming in a pool of salt and olive oil, but mostly salt) and left the restaurant. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 4 stars but there was one thing that I could not get over.  The tomato sauce on our pizza was borderline cold.  What a shame because everything else was great.  

We ordered 2 cured meats and one soft cheese to start.  They were all very well done and on point.  Since they didn't come with bread, we got the bread knots for accompaniment.  The zucchini flowers stuffed with halibut and shrimps came next.  My boyfriend thought it was tasteless but I liked it very much.  I thought the stuffing was going to be like a shrimp-dumpling-like constancy, but it was just simply minced seafood and fishy in a good way.  A squeeze of lemon was all it needed.  Then the main event arrived:  the truffle pizza.  It was beautiful!  As I bit into it, I was like errrrr.  The flavour was amazing; the combination of tomato sauce, fresh truffles, and burrata cheese tasted like an orgasm in my mouth... but it was cold.  I didn't send it back because I thought maybe it was just my slice since the pizza was quite long.  My second piece was slightly warmer but still not at my desired temperature; by then half of the pizza was gone and it seemed hypocritical to say anything at that point.  The fact that the tomato sauce was cold was quite puzzling because the crust was perfectly crunchy and the cheese was melted on top.  However, even though the sauce was kind of cold, it was so fresh and delicious.  My boyfriend said that he liked the crust at Buca but he prefer the flavour of Terroni pizzas.

I would try Buca again because I liked the freshness and delicate flavours of the dishes.  Another thing I really liked is that I didn't feel weighed down after eating here; I was able to satisfy my carb cravings without being bloated afterwards."}
{"text":"Overall was a solid experience. The atmosphere is good, though odd that there isn't a true bar/bar area. As for the food, got the Bigoli- the pasta was perfectly cooked and the duck ragu was great, and also not too heavy. Definitely need to get more than that though if you're looking for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Buca today.  Food was great. Ambiance nice.  One word of caution though...unlike most restaurants, they charge for every piece of bread and ounce of olive oil!  Although this is noted in their menu it is easy to miss unless you are looking for it... and why would you be looking for it when every restaurant you go to provides this gratis?"}
{"text":"Dinner at Buca in Toronto on 3/28/2013. 

Buca, Toronto, ON
Food: Italian.
http://www.buca.ca

Overall: 5.5/10 vs. restaurants priced $$$/5.
Ambiance: Ok. 
Food: Good. 
Service: Ok.  
Wine/Drinks: Good. 
My rating scale: Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Ok, Needs Improvement, Terrible. 

Ambiance: Lacks \"warmth\" given the concrete floor and slab walls. Buca is sub-ground and the back room has no windows and thus feels a little like a bunker. Beware, it's extremely loud given the sounds bounce off the walls and floor. I'd suggest sitting in the front room that has high ceilings and more light.

Food: Interesting menu but nothing tasted really extraordinary other than the burrata cheese pizza, which was incredible. The stuffed calamari sounded better than it actually was. The prosciutto and cheese was good; as was the braised beef with polenta. The lamb on a stick and the pastas were misses.

Service: Positives: the wait staff is attentive and very educated on the food. Negatives: the waiter sold the fact the chef trained in Rome a little too much - I didn't reveal that Rome is not really a Mecca for food like other parts of Italy are. Our waiter interrupted our table too often. A waiter should wait until there is a lull in the diners' conversation or politely ask to interrupt, not just start speaking and expect the diners to stop and listen. 

Wine/Drinks: Giuseppe, the sommelier is helpful and knowledgeable however, we waited for a good 10-12 minutes for him to get to our table after asking for the sommelier's help. I don't like how the wine list is organized. Giuseppe is assuming his diners don't know much about wine by listing his wines under the categories: light, medium and full bodied wines. If I know what I want, it's difficult to find it because I have to then guess what his interpretation of the wine is.

Overall Comments: The menu is definitely interesting and the staff is knowledgeable so I'm willing to try it again in the front room, however I am not rushing to get back.

{"text":"I knew I was in for a treat when the waiter recommended a beet and vodka martini. Then came amazing bread knots, an incredible eggplant Napoleon and charcuterie plate. Then main course of Bronzino and porterhouse was incredible. The meats melted in your mouth.  I loved the open space and high ceilings, the atmosphere was hip yet inviting. Everyone in our group really enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"My experience at Buca was an excellent meal in a surprisingly modern setting.

The food was excellent. The cheese board was fairly portioned, with well-paired and understated additions. Our salad was a generous portion as well, and was extremely fresh and flavorful. The fried squash blossoms were likely the highlight of the night - a great combination of textures and flavors. The pasta was good, but not quite as good as I expected. 

Though the wine selection was extensive, I didn't like any of the by-the-glass options I tried. After I described what wine I liked, the waiter brought me three samples, and none were satisfying (high-maintenance, I know). My companion had a cocktail that was good, but too sweet to drink the whole thing.

The service was decent, but very slow. Dinner took us two hours, even without dessert. Our waiter came around a fair bit, but was sometimes out of sight for quite a while when we needed something. 

I really loved the atmosphere inside - the high ceiling, low (but not too low) lighting, and the warehouse-y feel combined with the modern, upscale furnishings was both comfortable and trendy. 

Overall, I'd absolutely recommend going to Buca and making an evening of it."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Toronto. Incredible Fritti and appetizers. Great service. Wonderful experience in general."}
{"text":"Buca is certainly an example of a Toronto restaurant that's doing it all. They seem to have struck a very intriguing balance between rustic artisanal Italian cuisine and contemporary techniques. The menu is constantly modified and the specials are always unique and interesting, which is a reassurance of the freshness and locality of the ingredients being used. The selections are varied, from rustic fresh-pasta dishes, in-house charcuterie, fresh baked breads, local and imported cheeses, all the way to offal meats and different game. The wine list is a good reflection of Italy's wine regions and truly touches on most of the important and some obscure varieties. I highly recommend the duck bigoli, gnocchi, or any of the salumi platters. The nodini are also a staple that can't be missed."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, beautiful decor, service was perfect. It was one of the best dining experiences that I have had in Toronto in years.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Buca was on my Restaurant Resolutions list (check my blog) and it was the last restaurant on the list. I was going to save it for my birthday but I'm glad I didn't because I'll probably come back here for my birthday. 

Down the secluded alley, you definitely feel like this place is a special one and it is. Once you get down the stairs, all you want to do is look up at the high ceilings and chandeliers. These guys take \"exposed brick\" to a whole other level. It's simple but it's gorgeous. 

Gents, if you're looking for a special place to propose, have an anniversary dinner or take her on the third date, this is the spot. 

The leather banquettes are super comfortable as well. They've recently expanded and I hear they're getting 2 more locations. I'm not sure how this will affect the quality and the service but the quality of the food was great.

Service: there's definitely some Italian waitstaff in the house (speaking of the waitstaff: holy eye-candy in the leather aprons). My friend actually didn't believe that our waiter was truly Italian! Maybe he was just a bit too strong on the accent. I don't know. He was a bit \"off.\" I can't really explain it. It's not that he wasn't doing his job but there was something weird. Oh, and he didn't pair my wine with my dish very well at ALL. If I say I'm having \"X\" dishes, as a waiter in a high-end restaurant I expect that he would know which wine should go with which dish. Especially if a glass of wine is minimum $13. 

One thing I HATE: put your menu on your website! PLEASE. It's 2012. At least put the staple items you're not changing up there. 

WE ATE
There's so many options (as explained in other posts) but we decided to do a mix of traditional with adventurous. 

We started out with the Gnoccho  Frito, which is essentially house cured pork fat (or lardo di collonatta as they call it). It's served with \" fried dumplings\" which are hallowed pieces of dough, sprinkled with some sort of sugar because they were sweet. It sounds like the biggest rip off of life but it was so mo-fo delicious. The pork melts onto the dumpling and its the best taste bud tease. 

This was also where the waiter was off: he kept on insisting we get  the nodini (warm bread knots), two times after we asked him to explain what \"Italian dumplings\" were and that we wanted that dish. 

We moved onto the buratta, melon and prosciutto salad. This was great but it wasn't my favourite dish. Maybe it's because I shared it but I didn't feel like there was enough buratta. Yes, first world problems. I think Campagnolo's heated buratta with grapes is my all-time favourite buratta dish. The other paradox of this that I was practically licking the plate. It could have been because we waiting for the pasta. 

From there, we decided to split between the pastas. The Cavatelli Al Pomodoro is a safe choice; very traditional - ripe roma tomato finished with pecorino crotonese cheese. This is some of the freshest pasta and tomato sauce I have ever had. 
At $22, the quality is there. I just wish the portion was (but maybe this was because we were sharing). I swear they must have some secret Nonna mafia in the back hand-rolling pasta. It's that good. 

We also got the Gnocchi Alla Crema Di Zuca. These hand rolled ricotta dumplings with pumpkin cream, parmigiano, and pecornio cheese are topped with crisp, maple glazed prosciutto. The presentation of this dish was immaculate. And the taste was incredible. It's one of those Rachel Ray \"MMMM\" moments. I also like the seasonality of this dish. Bravo. 

From there, we moved on to dessert. Dining Companion had the gelato. She seemed quite satisfied with it. I had the Tiramasu. It was a good portion and all components just worked together. There really are no words for this dish. It's that good. Don't share. You'll want it all to yourself! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Overall, yes, it's expensive, especially for the portion sizes. I was satisfied but I wasn't full. The waiters need to know which wine to pair with particular dishes and not be \"off\" or push certain dishes for whatever reason. 

The pasta is some of the best I've ever had. 

Buca reservation (see that?). This one isn't really for a casual walk in (but super score if you do). Can be slightly intimidating but the food here is worth it. Now I know what people meant when they say that this is one of best Italian restaurants in the city. I'm curious as to how the other outlets do. That said, I really like the original decor in here. It's perfect for a photo shoot and it's worth coming back here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The bread knots are to die for, fresh and bite size so it's just perfect.  We asked the waitress to build up a menu for us and it was perfect.  We got a charcuterie and cheese board, as pasta dish, pizza, and 2 seafood dishes.  The dessert was the highlight.  It was an almond cake with lemon curd.  A must."}
{"text":"Just left Buca and wanted to leave a review while the experience (and taste) is still fresh: in short, the dining experience was nothing short of incredible. The ambiance, service and menu (changed daily; all elements prepared in-house) proved and deserve a 5/5 review (a rare commodity). I wish I could remember the menu names of each item we ordered but as a quick summary I would highly recommend any of the following (best enjoyed as family-style): parmigiana di melanzane and nodini as appetizers (both legacy items on the menu); funghi and pomodoro e tartufo pizzas (the burrata cheese is incredible); and, the bigoli, pomodoro and and agnolotti pastas. See attached pics! Must try!"}
{"text":"Buca is down a dark alley and into a basement.  And it's really good.  

The best:
There is a meat locker over the bar.  It's really neat.

The good:
- Great service.  Good wine recommendations, good food recommendations, friendly and knowledgeable staff that didn't mind my standard 20-questions before ordering.
- Rosemary bread knots were awesome.  I could definitely eat 2 plates of those myself.
- The decor is kinda yuppie-older-hipster-douche; but it's nice. I like the high ceilings and exposed I beams... I can do without polished concrete floors.
- Sarah T seems to know EVERYONE here which may have contributed to my excellent experience.
- The washrooms are individual rooms.  LOVE that.
- They use open table.  Anyone who uses open table is okay by me.

The bad:
- The espresso is not good.
- The washroom I used didn't have any soap and I had to finish washing my hands in another one.  This is a huge issue for me.  It also lacked some of the finishing touches of the rest of that place - e.g., there was no 'cap' on the sprinkler, it was just a hold dug out of the ceiling and there was no door stop so someone had pushed the doorknob through the wall when they opened it too hard.
- There are too many Italian words on the menu and they don't describe the dishes if you don't know those words.  Lucky for me our waitress knew them all and didn't mind breaking it down for me.  She was actually totally awesome throughout the meal.
- Dessert was weak.  Why is dessert always weak?  I shouldn't order desserts.

Funny story:
I picked up the bottle to pour more wine and a server came RUNNING to do it. He had a sixth sense about customers picking up alcohol containers.  His spidey sense tingled and like the flash he was just THERE.  We laughed.

Overall, I would come here again for sure.  It was about $140 for 2 people including a $50 bottle of wine; I think that's reasonable.  

The ratings math: 5 stars, -1 for the soap incident."}
{"text":"Good pizza. The chef takes forever to plate the pasta at 9pm on a Wednesday. People have conversations about law and politics. If I wasn't in love I probably wouldn't have gone."}
{"text":"Wine is pretty good but pretty expensive. I have had better wine at that price point. 

The gnocchi is overrated. It sounds interesting that they do such fancy treatment to their pasta but if it doesn't make it taste better why bother? The gnocchi was black because of onion ash but there was absolutely no onion taste. The best part of the dish was the crispy parmigiano reggiano that was on it but that didn't make it worth $30. I should've opted for the duck pasta. The waiter even did one of those I-told-you-so's, which wasn't the greatest. I wish he had emphasized the duck pasta a bit more so that I got the hint that I should order it instead of the gnocchi. 

Overall the dish I got was very disappointing and I felt ripped off. Buca didn't deliver the flavour I'm accustomed to for restaurants at this price point. 

Based on my experiences I can't recommend this place with so many other tasty options in the area."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and is not worth the price you pay, but desert was great (tiramisu)."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about Italian restaurants, but Buca sure does it well! It pains me to say that I could not find one fault in my eating experiences here. Thoroughly enjoyed lamb brains(how I found  Buca initially), and fresh crudo. Duck egg Bigoli and Raviolo were both fantastic, with just enough portion to leave you wanting more. Another plus? Grabbing a hand-rolled cigar from one of the only remaining cigar factories right outside the doorstep."}
{"text":"For the price we paid, not one thing was amazingly good. Everything was satisfactory at most. Meats and cheeses were very good and the highlight of the night. For service, plates should be kept warmer so as to not let my food go cold. Pasta sauce was good but not amazing although the texture of the al dente chew was good. Finally, the wine suggestion by the server was horrible.. 70$ bottle that tasted like a 8.99 wine from a plastic carton at LCBO. Oh and the killer.... You would think they can do a tiramisu properly being an Italian restaurant charging 9 bucks for a portion.... Face palm .... How can it not even be set? It was mascarpone soup ... Aerated texture is important but not to the point where it's completely liquid... And the meringue topping did not match . Final note... Portion sizes are extremely small, why are you pretending to be a French restaurant? Overall a very forgettable experience. I don't understand why so many people swear by this place. Maybe the other locations of this chain have better food but I highly doubt it ."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent and pasta was quite good. Appies left something to be desired. All in all, likely to return!"}
{"text":"Everything you've heard about it is true - great ambiance, engaging waiters, delicious  food.  Gluten free pasta leave a something to be desired, however the cocktails and cheese plate will have us returning soon."}
{"text":"One of the shining stars of the Toronto culinary scene. Everything is done to perfection; the space, the service and the amazing food! A great place to try some dishes that you might not normally be accustomed to seeing, you can be sure it will be delicious whatever it is!!"}
{"text":"I always leave restaurants in the entertainment district to the 905-ers on the weekend but a last minute chance to join the lovely Gita R and hubby Nate for dinner at Buca was too much to resist.

After a round of fancy cocktail drinks, we started with appetizers - the large board of house cured meats, stuffed olives,  and the amazing Gnocco Fritto, which were heavenly.  Mains - my pasta had baby octopus and was beyond great.  I'm a small eater but I truly could have eaten a second portion of that dish.  Also tried a bite of the Bigoli pasta as well.  

The food at Buca really shines and is definitely 5-star but I'd rate the service pretty low.  I found it a bit scattered and inattentive.  Our server never returned to top up our wine glasses.  Not a big problem to do it ourselves but I had waiter hiss at me once when I tried to do that an Olive Garden so ever since that incident, I've left the wine refilling to a server.  We asked to see a dessert menu and our server forgot.  He returned 20 minutes later and we had to ask again.  By then, our interest in dessert had passed.

For the lux price of our meal at Buca, the service certainly didn't meet my expectations.  Definitely nothing wrong with the food but the service was just meh."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not a \"nice nice out\" place. 

Urban feel. Great service. Food was just ok. 

Started with the bread balls. Rosemary and sea salt. Yum! Definitely recommend. 

My wife bad the agnolotti pasta. It was terribly bland. No taste whatsoever.  Overpowering lemon flavour. But that was it. 

I had the funghi pizza. Love the scissors to cut it. Soo cool!  It was good. Had tons of potential. Needs more \"love\"

It was my wife's birthday and I heard they make you feel like royalty for your birthday. It was t even acknowledged. I called twice to ensure they knew we were celebrating. Not even a HBD

The lemon cookies you finish off the meal with (at bill time) was the highlight of the evening. Really good 

Service was ok, other than the missed birthday. 

Not coming back anytime soon. Definitely didn't live up to the hype. 

FAIL."}
{"text":"After a day of drinking beers all day at a baseball game and later on at a Oyster festival, responsible decisions had to be made......

It was time to switch to wine at dinner.


Buca is a beautiful, upscale and lavish restaurant in the heart of Toronto. 

Getting reservations on the fly aren't easy, especially when one of the people in your party might be slurring their words but apparently my friends were able to pull some strings, if you you know what I mean. (I have no idea what I mean, I don't know they got us a table but I ain't complaining) 

After leaving the restaurant we first had a table at, we got up and walked through some alley ways and ended up at Buca. The place is visually stunning. For the ambiance and quality of food, the price isn't bad at all. Since it was my last night in the city, it was the perfect way to say goodbye. 

The food was fantastic. My friend got the duck with egg pasta, which was phenomenal. I got the ravioli which was some of the best I've ever had. Everyone loved their meal and was satisfied beyond belief. 

It was a nice bitter sweet moment."}
{"text":"I had high expectations with Buca as I've seen this restaurant on many top Canadian restaurant list over the years.  For a birthday, we came here to celebrate and the restaurant did not disappoint.  I can understand why it has been on many list and continues to be.  Buca's service is top or near the top in Toronto... fluid, attentive, and warm.  Food service is orchestrated wonderfully... the timing is incredible and precise.  The food itself is as delicious as it is beautiful.  And on top of that, a thoughtful gift from the chef ended the night on a high note.  

Our interaction started before even we entered the door... a courteous call to me to confirm our arrival, understand any allergies, and if it was an event happened the day before.  Most of the time, Im not sure if that call is good (I can understand it from a restaurateur side it is) but I appreciated the extra questions to ensure we had a great experience.

The restaurant is a wonderful juxtaposition of modern and heritage.  The building clearly has some old roots but its been updated to clean lines, exposed brick work, and artistic distress.  There are two rooms ... one looks to be cozy and held in the wine cellar.  It's gorgeous though... lots of glass enclosures highlighting their large wine library (the wine listing is quite extensive).  The other is huge vaulted ceiling, exposed open kitchen, instagram worthy filtered sunlight, and in the evening, a romantic atmosphere.  The atmosphere can change immediately though... earlier in the evening, it was easy to have a wonderful conversation.  As the night went on, a huge group arrived and clearly was looking to enjoy the night.  It was near impossible to hear across the table and we were about 5 tables away from them.  As for the tables, i do appreciate how i could walk between them without needing to turn side ways.

The service staff here is impeccable.. in addition to the actual servers, we probably interacted with 4 other servers and runners making sure our glass was never left empty, dishes cleared immediately, new cutlery and plates are given, and delivery of food just freshly prepared.  Most of the time, this can feel over the top but there was a genuine warmth from them.  Comparing this to my other top restaurant, Grey Gardens, I would say Buca is a bit more refined and subtle compared to the more energetic and fun service.  Both worthy of being called top service though!  I did appreciate the in depth knowledge of our server though to help craft our perfect meal.  We ended up going with all of her recommendations.  

We started with the scallops crudo, salami trio (cured goose, calabrese pork sausage, and proscuittini), eggplant parmigiana (parmigiana di melazane), trofie pasta (spring selection), duck breast (petto d'anatra), and finishing with the tiramisu.  

Scallops Crudo - Incredibly gorgeous plating and the flavour matched it.  Thinly sliced scallops with a interesting smoked spring greens and ramps and a subtle heat coming from the n'duja in the sauce.  It could have easily overwhelmed the scallops but it just played that line very well.

Salami Trio - we selected the goose, spicy pork, and a cured pork ... from those 3, I like the calabrese the most.  Full on flavour and with each chew, it just added to it.  The heat is not overbearing.  The goose was nice as well with the spice notes of clove, orange, and cinnamon.  It is very fatty... so for those who are not into fatty meats, it may not be for you.  The pork was very good but hard to keep up with the calabrese.  What stole the show was the pickled asparagus that came with it... wow, I wish I got more of that!  Just a right punch of sour, tart, and a minute sweetness.  

Parmigiana di Melazune .. aka eggplant - A tower of burrata, creamy ricotta, and super crisped eggplant is presented on top of a balanced tomato sauce.  This is not your momma's eggplant.  It takes what is good from the regular Italian dish and just turn it up a notch with really good ingredients and execution.  I love the creaminess of the ricotta, burrata, and eggplant to contrast with the fried crispy shell on the vegetable.

Trofie Pasta ... hand made al dente pasta with spanish octopus, n'duja, fava beans, grape tomato, and bone marrow.  Oh wow... this was very very good.  It has that perfect chew and nooks and crannies to take in all the wonderful sauce. It's a lucious tomato based one with a good kick of spice to keep your taste buds wanting more.  The grape tomato is a lovely burst of sweetness and the octopus was cooked wonderfully... tender!  

Petto D'anatra ... duck - Ok another winner. It was cooked to medium well with a super crackly skin and the fat beautifully rendered out.  Well executed and the rhubarb was the perfect sweet tart compliment.

Tiramisu ... gorgeous presentation and I love how the chocolate, espresso, and creamy marscapone played off each other.  One of the best versions in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Full review blogged.  Dish Highlights Below:

Scamorza Pizza with house cured fennel pork salumi, radicchio, chili, local smoked buffalo milk cheese:  Featuring oblong Roman-style pizzas served un-cut on large wooden cheeseboards alongside a pair of shears, this $17 pie would certainly prove a step up from the nodini and with ample amounts of aromatic salumi, bitter radicchio, slightly acidic tomato sauce, and creamy cheese this was a case where the whole was not only as good as the sum of its parts, but better.  With the crust minimally charred and slightly floppy plus each ingredient fresh and flavorful this was the sort of pizza worth going out for and given the lightness of the crust it proved an excellent appetizer for three (and would have proven a formidable main for one.)

Spaghetti Alla Carbonara with bronze die cut gragnano di napoli pasta with house made guanciale, pecorino, black pepper tossed tableside with farm hen's egg:  Dining with two of the least adventurous people I know the pastas at Buca would prove a bit of a challenge as none were boring in the least, but after a more than a week of great eating I was given carte blanche to order something I thought they would like and we started with a rather traditional carbonara featuring salty pork and an ample shake of both pecorino and pepper with the egg added and mixed tableside while the pasta was still steaming.  With the noodles thick and springy and each ingredient melded into silky smooth sauce this was simplicity done right.

Fusilli Al Ferretto with fresh hand rolled fusilli with fennel soffritto, green tomato and golden delicious apple sauce, spot prawns, toasted focaccia:  Obviously more adventurous than the spaghetti this large pile of fusilli would prove to be the savory of the afternoon and also one of the most impressive pastas thus far in 2012.  With each wide noodle prepared to just past al dente and the prawns still snappy it was in the juxtaposition of apple and tomato, fructose versus acid, and the manner in which the aromatic slick of olive oil infused with fennel and garlic that truly made this dish 'pop.'  Uncertain as to how the family would react to such a non-traditional dish I was admittedly surprised when both my mother and aunt seemed equally as wowed as I.

Bigoli hand cranked duck egg pasta with duck ragu, mascarpone, basil:  Perhaps the restaurant's most talked about pasta I ordered this pasta for myself with hopes that the ladies would give it a try but more than willing to eat the whole thing if they did not.  Ignoring the \"duck egg\" pasta as I find it hard to believe anyone could differentiate they type of egg used in noodles, I will note that the pasta itself was substantially different in texture from the flour/semolina based dishes that proceeded it and with the noodles less absorbent the use of creamy mascarpone mixed with the rich duck ragu worked brilliantly to make the sauce adherent.  A bit 'funky' without being gamey and rife with the flavor of duck confit tucked beneath ripe tomatoes I'm happy to say that while not quite as impressive as the Fusilli I definitely understand this dish's fanfare and would also place it amongst the best pastas of the year thus far.

Tiramisu di Buca with espresso soaked house made tapioca biscuits layered with mascarpone and chocolate mousse:  At $12 I expected this to be one hell of a tiramisu and...well...it was.  Having never heard of \"tapioca biscuits\" before we were informed that this was a gluten-free recipe utilizing tapioca flour, eggs, and butter to build a fluffy base that was subsequently saturated with espresso prior to being topped with mascarpone, tapioca pudding, chocolate mousse, and finally a crispy chocolate tuille.  Crunchy and creamy, sweetness balanced by bitter - it was a great take on a classic with the tapioca pearls adding another layer of intrigue while the only thing missing, maybe, was a splash of rum.

Risotto Originario with sweet risotto of heirloom Calabrian rice finished with buffalo milk, chianti poached plum, Quebec Flora Honey, Amaretti, Candied Clover:  They had me at \"risotto\" on a dessert menu and although it was nearly as expensive as one of the pastas ($14) it was worth every penny... toothsome but creamy, sweet but funky...it was perfect, and in this case a picture truly is worth a thousand words as it was the best dessert I had in all of Canada.  

The Verdict:  While some have complained that Buca is expensive (both the food and the all Italian wine list) and I certainly do not disagree with this claim as our lunch (without any of the aforementioned wine but including tax and tip) came out to nearly $45/pp, I can only say that for my tastes it was worth almost every penny.  High on quality, big on flavor, and rustic without sacrificing precision I've been to very few places executing Italian food on the level of Gentile and his team and nearly all of them have either been helmed by men named Vetri, White, Benno, or Batali."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to Buca but first time writing a review on Yelp. If I wrote a review based on my last 2 visits this would be a 5+ star review.  However unfortunately for the restaurant I'm writing this review based on my current visit.  I came here for my 40th Birthday dinner with my aunts. This was my top pick so I wanted to come here for my birthday. From my past visits the service was impeccable and my main server was always so nice, helpful and friendly.  This time the server who's this tall blond lady was a little rude. She seated me while I waited for my aunts.  She knew I was waiting for more people to come and they were running late but she came to me twice asking if I wanted to order. Obviously I'm not going to order until everyone arrived.  When they finally arrived only 10 mins late I asked the server for her advice on the meats  and cheese to get on the charcuterie board but she seem impatient and short with me. She's like \"I don't know what you like\".  But I wanted her opinion as to what's good.  Shouldn't she be the one explaining the menu to me?!  In the end I ended up making an executive decision because she couldn't help me and choose some random stuff.  When I asked her for recommendations for the mains her answer was just get the dishes that's always on the menu, she said it's always there so People must like it!  In the meantime not answering my question as to what was in entrees.  Later on in the evening I was on the phone but I heard my aunt asking our server what they do for Birthdays.  I looked up from my conversation and saw the server ignored my aunt's question and walked away.  We got fed up and when asked for the bill it took her forever to bring it to us.  All the while the assistant servers were amazing and brought us water refill and chilli sauce when asked so quickly. I felt like the assistant servers were so much better than our server. We hope they get some of the gratuity we gave the main server since they deserved it more. So enough with my complaining about the poor service from this one individual.  Let's talk about Buca. The restaurant is in the basement so cellular service is very slow. However you're having a nice dinner you shouldn't be on your cell anyways!  The decor is very romantic and dim.  I ordered the peach Bellini which was yummy.  We shared the charcuterie board with 3 meats and cheeses and the baked olive with pork(a must have side) so delicious ! Mains we shared between the 3 of us the funghi mushroom pizza ($30)( I order this everytime, it's amazing), also the pigs blood spaghetti ($24) and Bigoli ($22).  Both pasta dishes and pizza were amazing.  After the main server ignored my aunt about the Birthday comment we decide we had enough of this poor service and forgot dessert and go to The Shangri-La Hotel for dessert instead. I was so excited to come to Buca and although the food was still out of this world the service for this visit left a bad taste in my mouth and ruin my Birthday dinner! That is why I gave Buca a 3 star instead of 5. Our server ruined Buca's perfect grading!! I think service is just as important as the food. I'm not sure if I would come back again with the poor service we experienced by our server.  For the price we paid I'm sure there's better Italian places out there that I can go to. Like Gusto 101 across the street or Terroni's which are my other two favs with amazing service consistently.  It's really too bad, since it was one of my aunts first time to Buca and I was ranting and raving about how great it was and it turned out she had a poor experience.  Goes to show how important it is to hire great people these days."}
{"text":"Clean, precise execution on the food.  5 star service.  Very attractive setting.  It's a reliable choice that won't likely disappoint.  Joanne Kates ranked it the number 1 restaurant in Toronto for 2014.  Before I visited this place I had my doubts, but now I'm a believer."}
{"text":"I've been to Buca several times and always hope it will live up to its reputation, but it never seems to. Last night we shared several starters since we weren't too hungry for mains. 
Bread knots 5/5 (can't go wrong here, crowd pleaser)
Octopus 3/5 (dry and too spicy)
Eggplant parmigiana w/ burrata 5/5 (sublime)
Fried olives 2/5 (just wrong, too salty)
Lardo and crisp dumplings (bland, and plain lard doesn't belong on any menu)
Lambs brains 5/5 (silky creamy on the inside, crisp and salty on the outside)
Cheese platter 4/5 (tasty but nothing special)

Service was snobby, unhelpful and pretentious. There's really no need for the cold reception.  Particularly from servers and hostesses that are making 10 bucks an hour. Get over yourself. Lose the attitude. A real turn off. Ambiance the same. I definitely do not like the vibe or energy of either the big canaverous dark main room nor the smaller, brighter back room for larger groups."}
{"text":"wow. i asked them to make a special dish for me... buffalo ricotta gnocchi with a basic tomato/basil sauce... and it was incredible. the salumi di buca and formaggi were delicious as well and the service was great. total yum!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for over a month and where do they seat us? Next to the open waiter station. I asked to be moved and the Maitre de acted put off by my asking, attitude. 
Our male server from Milan had one hell of an attitude. Hello, you're a waiter! We order our $75. bottle of wine but they were out of it. Seriously? At 7:30 you didn't know what wines you
were out of? 
Our food was ok but not mouthwatering or amazing. Nothing I can't have around the corner in the West Village, NYC. The best thing we had was the cappuccino. It was seriously the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Buca. BUCA. BUCAAAA. With a patio nestled in an alleyway off King Street West and an indoor basement restaurant, this is a pricey, but impressive Italian gem. 

I love the location, so mysterious and we were seated on the 'patio' to enjoy a balmy summer night. Lovely ambiance and the service was good as well. The servers were knowledgeable and polite, but it wasn't a memorable service. 

Food: My friend called it euphoric. I echo that sentiment as it was a stellar Italian meal from start to finish. Our group of 3 split the bread knots and pig ears as the appetizer. I also had the olive oil and beet - infused vodka cocktail that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND - it went down like silk. For my main I had the clam pasta which was well-done. I felt that it was a bit lacking in clams but the delicious home-made pasta made up for it. So chewy and flavourful. My friends tried the bigodi which I preferred the sauce of and the milk - poached veal tenderloin was SUPERB. The meat was so tender. 
And then there was dessert, pork blood chocolate tart and the tiramisu were stupendous. Yes, I said pork blood. Try it. I dare you. I felt the pork blood contributed more toward the texture and the dark chocolate was delightfully rich with an orange undertone that paired perfectly with the apricot and pistachios. A little rich that I don't think I could have consumed a whole one on my own but delightful to share. I would also eat a bucket of that tiramisu,  'nuff said. All in all, this was a superb Italian meal.  

Price: I did find it a bit pricey for the portion size though I will say that the portions were adequate to fill you. My own bill with an entree, cocktail and a split of 2 apps + 2 desserts came to $75 with tip included. 

Overall, I can't wait to return to try their other dishes and pizzas."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for a special birthday dinner earlier this year. I made a reservation for 5PM on a Friday night weeks in advance, and hoped that we would be in and out in less than an hour and a half as we had a Raptors game to go to at 7. 

As soon as we stepped through the door, we were greeted warmly and led to our seat. Our server came over and asked us if it was our first time at Buca and offered us suggestions and recommendations for our meal. Their menu is designed \"sharing-style\" which to me basically means that portion sizes are smaller and they want you to order more. I decided to order on behalf of both of us, and settled on Nodini (bread knots) and Parmiagiana di Melanzane (a take on eggplant parmesan) to start, followed by a meat pizza (for him) and a vegetarian pasta dish (for me) as our mains (which I believe was eggplant ravioli, although my memory seems to fail me now). 

Our apps came out fairly promptly - I thought the Nodini was good, but not spectacular; the real standout was the eggplant which was incredible and I wish that I could eat every single day of my life. After the apps came the pizza...and then we waited...and waited...and waited. Apparently our server had assumed that we would be sharing both the pizza and the pasta and told the kitchen not to fire the pasta yet. When we informed him of his error he was EXTREMELY apologetic (I think he actually came over on 5 separate occasions to apologize) and the pasta came out shortly after. We were even offered a complimentary dessert to make up for the misunderstanding! We were offered a choice of chocolatey or fruity, and after emphatically requesting something rich and chocolatey, we were brought over Buca's Tiramisu, which was really fantastic. I'm no Tiramisu connoisseur, but it was hands-down the best Tiramisu I've ever tasted. In fact, the flavour profiles of everything we ate during our meal was really spot-on, and I was quite pleased with the food. 

Not only was the food great, the service was also very good - water glasses always topped up, etc. Our server wasn't exactly the warmest or friendliest, but was efficient and did his job well. As one reviewer already mentioned, the leather aprons the servers wear seem a bit strange, and at one point I looked over and there was a line of servers standing in a row in front of the kitchen just staring out at the diners, which was a little creepy...

Anyway, Buca is on the pricier end as far as restaurants go, but a lovely special occasion restaurant - I hope to be back soon!

Must note: Buca was recently listed as one of Canada's top 50 restaurants! http://vacay.ca/top-50-restaurants/"}
{"text":"I found Buca while wandering down King street just before 6pm.   It has a quaint, low key vibe with exposed brick, wood beams, and lots of natural light.  We were seated at a table near the kitchen.

The wine list is very extensive, but there are a limited number of wines sold by the glass.  Glasses have two sizes: 3oz and 6oz.   The pasta was fresh and made by hand.  I had the gnocchi ripeni, which was by far the best gnocchi that I've had in a very long time; the filling, sauce and overall texture were amazing.  My companion had the bigoli (duck egg pasta) which was also delicious. We were unfortunately pressed for time and unable to taste dessert.

The service was warm and attentive, and added to the experience.  I'd definitely go back when I'm next in Toronto."}
{"text":"Eager to try buca, and the chefs natural simplistic approach we had lunch on a weekday. The daily menu offered many choices of pasta, pizza, fish and meats and we started with the olives and fried dough balls which were expertly seasoned. I came here with a cordon blu graduate so he commented on the small aspects of our meal. 

For appetizers we had the heirloom tomatoes salad; simple and fresh, sliced tomatoes with dressing. Basic and unimpressive. Second: the duck fat with dumplings was overall good, perfect dough with an overpowering taste of cinnamon, that I still enjoyed as like that particular spice. 

For mains we sampled the meatballs spaghetti and egg noodle with duck which both were cooked to perfection, although  my dining partner didn't enjoy the texture of the meatballs; a little dry and bland for his taste.

For desserts we had the tiramisu and pigs blood fig tart. The fig could have a little less alcohol, overall this dish was a great culinary experience. I would defiantly recommend trying this dessert. The tiramisu with baked cheese was different, not sure if it authentically comes this way and you like it or do not. 

Ambiance was great, good venue and interesting space. Service was up to par but I wish the waiter explained some of the more complex menu items which finally happened at the end with the blood chocolate fig tart. This would be an improvement they could work on."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were disappointed with the menu especially since I was hoping for a special evening celebrating my wife's birthday. We've been to Italy many times enjoying cuisine's from north and south. The selections offered didn't have a semblance  to any region that we have ever visited. 
The sky high prices dampened our happy occasion ."}
{"text":"Food was great, but service was terrible. One of the servers refused when I asked for more time to decide on the main menu, saying \"Our chef would be glad to know what is going on with appetizer and main menu.\" Seriously?"}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse every time I've gone. The service is always off -- the staff is either condescending or incompetent -- and the food isn't as good as I remember it being. To be honest, since it's been so long since we last felt like going, I don't remember the details of my last meal other than the duck bigoli being bland, dry and overcooked.

From now on, if I want pasta, I'll go to Enoteca Sociale. If I want pizza, I can walk across the street to Libretto. If I want charcuterie, I'll go to The Black Hoof. If I want to be disappointed, I'll come to Buca."}
{"text":"It was very average. The red wine that the waitress suggested was the only good thing in this restaurant. We were really shocked how popular this restaurant is after visiting.

We got the nodini and it was way too crisp that it was difficult to chew or cut. They also put way too much garlic in it that we had to keep chugging water to balance it.

For entree, we got bigoli (the duck egg pasta people have been raving about) and carbonara. Bigoli was completely undercooked and didn't taste anything special. Similarly with carbonara, it was very salty and undercooked.

I won't go to this place again. It was too expensive for the quality of food we got and really average Italian food."}
{"text":"Buca is an absolute gem food-wise, and the main reason why I take one star away is because I think the portions are too small for the price. I came here once in the summer and it was lovely sitting on their outdoor \"patio\" area which is tucked in a little alleyway. Service was pretty decent as well, they were knowledgeable and good about answering questions, of which we had many.

For starters, we ordered the nodini (warm bread knots, olive oil, rosemary, garlic) and the orrechio di maiale (crispy pig's ears). A number of Yelp reviews I read talked about how delicious the nodini was, and I thought it was pretty tasty, well-seasoned bread, but end of the day it was just... bread. I enjoyed the crispy pig's ears more, which were also well-seasoned and felt kind of like eating chips and were just as addictive.

For mains, I ordered the bigoli (duck egg pasta) and my two friends got some kind of clam pasta and the vitello da latte (milk poached veal tenderloin.) First off, I really really enjoyed my pasta - there was a good balance of savoury and sweet flavours, the sauce was very creamy (probably because of the mascarpone), and the noodles were tougher than what is typical, but not in an unpleasant way; in fact, I actually quite enjoyed the texture of the noodles.

The clam pasta wasn't bad, although my friend did comment that the flavour was kind of unexpected for her... not exactly the traditional clammy/seafood flavour you normally find... maybe they used a different kind of sauce? The veal tenderloin, however, was such a standout dish, it was soooooo so soft and tender. To the point where my friend called it \"euphoric.\" 

While absolutely delicious, the portions really were not that big, so we found ourselves sharing two desserts to end off our meal - tiramisu and a pork blood chocolate tart. One of Buca's big things apparently is that they use unconventional and (for some) slightly frightening ingredients in their dishes, like pork blood, horse eye, lamb's brain, etc. The pork blood didn't really add any special flavour to the tart, but maybe changed the texture a little so that it seemed more gelatinous? Overall nothing to fear though. There were some nuts sprinkled on top, and the tart was very rich... something chocolate-lovers would enjoy. From what I remember of the tiramisu (clearly wasn't that memorable), it was good but I think didn't have enough bread/biscuit in it and was too liquid-y for my liking.

Drinks-wise, they have some decent cocktails, mine wasn't memorable but my friend got one that had olive oil in it which made the texture super smooth and she loved it.

My first experience here was fabulous, and I would love to come back to try other menu items. Again, I just wish their portions were bigger because a) they're delicious and b) I'm a growing woman with a healthy appetite, so Buca will definitely be more of a \"treat yo'self\" thing for me rather than a regular dining spot."}
{"text":"The Porchetta Sandwich is so good.  Definitely a must try.  Went to this place a couple of times and is one of the only restos open til late on King Street West.  Great place for some drinks as well."}
{"text":"Well exceeded my expectation. Excellent foods and service. I let a waitress to choose some dishes and wine; she did an excellent job. I wish I could give six stars."}
{"text":"First of all, the entrance is on Portland street about halfway between King and Adelaide.  Overall assessment: the food was 4 stars and the ambiance and service was 5 stars. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. The place was very busy for a Monday. We sat at a high top communal type bar table but there were also plenty of private tables. The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful. She recommended a charcuterie board for us and it was phenomenal. It came with little tiny bite size garlic knots that were so tasty. My husband ordered a pizza and liked it very much. It came whole with scissors to cut it which was different. I had the Bronzino and it was good. It didn't come with a vegetable and the waitress asked if I wanted to add one and I declined because I thought it would be too much food after the appetizer. I should have added a vegetable. The Bronzino was good but it's nice to have a side to switch up flavors."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here as a surprise. We were promptly seated at the wine bar, even though we didn't have reservations. 

We started with the carpaccio piemontese. This was my favourite dish of the night! The balconville apple cider vinegar added the perfect burst of flavour to compliment the cinnamon cap mushroom and fermented garlic. 

After that, we had our salumi. We chose the bresaola and two others that I've forgotten the names of. But all of them were delicious and came with a side of daily preserves. 

Then  we had the cervello, which was lamb's brain with Sicilian caper agliata. It was an interesting texture contrast between runny and crunchy. A definite must try! 

Then I had the spaghetti al Nero di maiale, which was hand-cut pork blood pasta with smoked burrata cheese. You can taste the smokiness in the cheese. 

We also had the agnello arrosto, which was lamb loin with sheep's milk ricotta, porcini and churned seashore honey. The honey was the best part of the dish and I would've missed it if my friend hadn't swiped a bit for me. 

We finished the meal with nectarine sorbet. It was slightly sweet, which highlighted the nectarine's natural flavour. Then we had a shot of limoncello as a digestivo. It was served perfectly, the glass was chilled too. 

The service was very warm and friendly. I suppose it helped that we sat at the wine bar, where all the servers passed by. 

Overall, I'll visit again because of the food and the staff."}
{"text":"Buca means \"hole\" in Italian, but this place is anything but. It's a gorgeous space with an industrial brick and beam look, impossibly high ceilings, and dim lighting from danging Edison bulbs. Walking in reservationless at dinner time is risky; this place was packed to the gills with stylish clientele, but we managed to secure a spot at the bar.

The menu is divided into molto Italian categories like salami, formaggi, pasta, pizze, pesce, and carne. It's quite overwhelming actually, and I'm surprised they are able to change up the options so often. I felt that pasta was a smart choice at Buca, so I opted for a veal stuffed tortelli. When the server reacted with surprise when I didn't order a starter, I should have clued in. The portion was VERY small, just five pockets of pasta on a plate. Soft and delicious though it was, it wasn't enough for me.

My friend Dan J ordered smart and got a pizza. It's an authentic thin-crust 'za the size of a placemat. They give you pair of scissors to cut it. It was covered with mouth-watering cured salami and buffalo mozzarella. It was tasty, and lucky for me he was willing to share. We ended the night with some dessert wines (they offer an impressive selection of wine) and a Buca Tiramsu served in a tall glass. (We each got one -- we didn't share y'all.)

A bit on the pricy side, so I won't come here hungry, but I would definitely come back when I'm looking to impress a date.

Obligatory Title Pun: BOOK-A reservation, amico.

Menu Readability: Elegant book in centre-aligned Helvetica.

Need to mention: The have an enomatic machine for wines by the glass.

What this place teaches me about myself: I should always err on the side of pizza."}
{"text":"One of the only restaurants in Toronto which I repeatedly visit and am not disappointed each and every time. 
If you're looking for fettuccine Alfredo and Cesar salad, this is not your kind of Italian. 
I've tried so many things on the menu, which changes, and they all hit the mark.
A gem in Toronto, for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but I've always found service to be pretty lacking. I have been maybe 3 times, but it's never my first choice because of this. There are a ton of great Italian places in the city that also provide great service, so I generally prefer other places over Buca. Their pizza is pretty tasty, but I've found some pasta dishes to be lacking in flavor. I've always found the servers to be pretty slow and uninteresting. There isn't a lot of engagement with the tables, which is too bad. There were times where I wanted to order a drink, but by the time I got the servers attention it was too late in the meal to bother. Too bad because they do have a great wine list! With some work on their service I think it would likely be a much more enjoyable place to dine!"}
{"text":"Well, have been dining out a great deal in this holiday season. This experience at Buca Osteria Enoteca on King was so negative I had to take the time to warn potential customers.

First of all, dining out with another couple, as we always do, we requested separate bills from our waitress, Kate.

We were informed that we could not get separate bills but would have to figure out the split ourselves. Seems wherever else we've dined this has never been a problem, but I guess at Buca they just couldn't provide the customer service to do it for us. 

The restaurant is very very dark and it's difficult to read the menu without the flashlight of your iphone. To add to this the sound level at the restaurant is so intense that in order to communicate with each other we found ourselves yelling.

Not fun.

To add to our general disatisfaction we were told if we want to have bread we would be charged an additional $5 for 3 buns and a few bread sticks. Forget it.

Get me out of here.

The food was ok but it was overshadowed by all the negatives. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"The dessert is to die for, the wine selection is outstanding. I also recommend to have a cocktail or two before opening wine ;)

You will start to imagine how it would taste when you \"study\" the menus. They have lamp intestine pasta, goose stuffed ravioli etc. Ask Matthew, by the way his service was awesome, the gelato special. He will surprise you."}
{"text":"Buca is seen as a King West staple which is understandable. They produce consistently good food. I was with a larger group so we had it family style and were able to share many of the dishes which was fantastic. 

The service was phenomenal, our server was knowledgable and friendly and made the experience fantastic. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The menu is hard to understand, too much gibberish to describe a pizza, but Buca has the best pizza in town, and excellent service (maybe a smile on the staff face would be nice too). The tiramissu, and baked apple tart are outstanding.

I would've given 5 stars if the menu had pictures of the dishes."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a little hard to locate because it's tucked in an alleyway across the street from Wvrst. We managed to get a 5:30 pm reservation on a Sunday (it was either that or after 9), so if you want a better time slot, you better book at least two weeks in advance. 

Buca does not offer complimentary bread, but their nodini ($6)- warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and sea salt- are a must try! These were perfect warm pockets of garlicky goodness! I could eat them all day long. 

For appetizer, we shared parmigiana di melanzane ($14)- preserved tomato and fried eggplant layered with bufala ricotta and burrata cheese. It was well-executed and I only wished that it stayed hot for longer. 

My boyfriend ordered gnocchi alla cenere ($26)- hand-rolled dumplings made from onion ash, served with fresh broccoli, pecorino and parmigiano cheese finished with fresh pregiato truffles. The gnocchi was very delicate, just the way I like it, and the truffles and cheese made for a heavenly rich combination- too rich for the bf, actually. We ended up trading plates (though quite unwillingly on my part). 

I opted for Buca's famous bigoli ($19)- hand-cranked duck egg pasta with duck leg, offal ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone and basil. The ragu had a great depth of flavour and thought it was superbly delicious, though not as rich as the gnocchi. I had read reviews that complained about the portion of this dish, but I found size perfectly adequate. Even though I liked the gnocchi, I was sad to give up my plate.

For dessert, we had tiramisu di Buca ($12)- espresso soaked house-made biscuits, layered with mascarpone and chocolate mousse. For me, the chocolate was too overpowering and I wasn't a big fan of it. 

Dessert aside, I really enjoyed the food at Buca, and I was sad that we didn't try any of their famous pizza. The prices are a bit too high for my liking, but I wouldn't mind an occasional indulgence. One strange thing was that our server kept speaking Italian to us (but he did repeat the statements in English afterwards), which confused me in our exchange. That said, I didn't find the behaviour snobby or pretentious, but just a little odd."}
{"text":"Wow was really impressed with the quality, service, and overall experience at BUCA. Amazing wine but on the pricier size. Food was fantastic and fresh. Small portions. The starter charcuterie board was too small and wouldn't recommend it. Overall great experience and good food!"}
{"text":"What stood out was the really great service of all those involved here and my main course of gnocchi tasted excellent. It was just a small portion and I was still hungry even after the dessert. Really happy they carry Moscato D'asti a sweeter Italian wine it was divine. Disappointed with the deconstructed panna cotta - the meringues on top and lavender were not working for me and the fruit preserve inside didn't help. Also wished they could split the bill. 5, stars for main course and wine, 4 star service, 2 stars dessert so I'll round up to a 4."}

My boyfriend and I were heading out for a night of theatre and wanted something really good withing walking distance.  Yes the restaurant is located down an alley and the sign is small but you won't have a problem finding it by foot.

One of the owners - Gus Giazitzidis - greated us and showed us to our table.  We were there early (5:45) so the place was pretty empty.  The space is amazing with it's industrial brick walls and high ceilings.  Our table was close to the open concept kitchen so I had a great view of the chefs at work.

I knew beforehand that I wanted the Nodini so they were ordered right away.  As soon as I saw the fried sausage stuffed olives I knew I had to have them as well.  OMG they were amazing!  The Nodini were great too however not quite as soft as I would have liked them.

By this time the restaurant was starting to get busy and after watching a steady stream of cheese boards go by I knew I had to have one.  My partner and I decided on a crumbly blue cheese like offering that was paired with diced poached pears with a hint of cinnamon, a firm cheese that was aged with a Barolo wine rind and paired with an amazing orange marmalade and last but not least a lovely bowl of Burrata that was paired with a rubarb compote. Thankfully my boyfriend was not a fan of the Burratta (he loved the Barolo and asked the waitress if he could have a jar of the marmalade lol) so I just took the bowl and dumped the rubarb on top and ate it as if it were dessert.  Heavenly!

Now on to the mains.  This was a tough choice.  I love carbonara and when I read the description of theirs with the fresh hens yolk served on top and tossed at your table I was pretty much won over.  My boyfriend order the Agnolotti which was stuffed with ricotta and served with a fresh pea puree.  They were like soft little pillows of creamy pasta and the sauce was so fresh tasting.  My carbonara could not have been better.  The hens yolk was the most vibrant colour of yellow orange (just the way a farm fresh egg should be!) and the smell of the cheese and lardons (bacon) as the pasta was tossed in front of me was so incredible. 

I don't think either one of us spoke a word to each other while we ate (aside from a quick \"can I try yours?\").  Once we were finished we just sat there with anticipation.  We could only begin to imagine how great the dessert would be.  We were not let down.  Our waitress advised us that the pastry chef used to work for Gordon Ramsay at the Maze Grill in London so we figured she must know what she was doing.

My boyfriend ordered the tiramasu and I ordered the panna cotta.  The tiramasu was creamy and rich.  The coffee flavour was perfect and the disc of sugar on top was so incredibly thin.  My panna cotta was like summer in a glass.  It was topped with a strawberry granita that tasted like fresh picked berries.  Below the milk and honey panna cotta was creamy, silky and just melted in my mouth.

I can't wait to go back to Buca.  I didn't get a chance to try their pizza or cured meats so a second visit will be in order very soon."}
