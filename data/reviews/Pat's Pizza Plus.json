{"text":"The best NY styled pizza anywhere near here I come hear often to get their pizza it's great. I would recommend coming in for lunch they have a great pizza combo for lunch!"}
{"text":"As promised, I tried the thin crust pizza.  It was better than the Sicilian, but to be honest, I found the crust a little bland and tough. The pizza was ok."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to carry out. As expected, the wait is very short. I like Pat's because it's the old fashioned pizza. The wings are great, and matched with a pizza deal, the price is reasonable. Not your thin crust yuppie pizza, just good pizza."}
{"text":"Stumpys is closed on Sunday which I respect. So we thought we would try Pat's. The pizza really had no flavor. I will not go back."}
{"text":"As much as I love living in South Phoenix, one of the things we lack here is good pizza. Whenever, I'm on the north side and wanting good pizza I stop at Pat's. My two favorite pizzas are just a plain pepperoni and their garlic chicken pesto. The pepperoni is simple grace, fresh tomato flavor bursting through the browned cheese flavor and crisp crunchy crust. It is sublime simplicity.  The garlic chicken pesto is the opposite side of the spectrum. A melody of flavor; garlic, pesto, jalape√±os that provide a tiny bit of heat and another dimension to the flavor. It's all rounded out with little pieces of chicken and chopped fresh tomatoes, all on top of their crispy delicate crust.   Pats is built for take out, but they do have a few tables. I drove the pizza from their address to my house near south mountain and it was still hot and crunchy. Give them a try."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Pizza by the slice, delicious and NY style! Staff is also great, friendly!"}
{"text":"I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is real New York style. In fact I prefer it to the pizzas I have had in NYC! It's a small place but totally delicious! The wings are yummy too. On weekdays they have a great lunch special for about 5 dollars, a drink and two slices of pizza. Perfect for lunch or a snack"}
{"text":"I have converted many long time spinato's fans to this pizza.  I've been all over the world including NY and Italy and had pizza... this is hands down the measuring stick I compare all other pizza's to.   Don't forget to order extra sauce!  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"If I am to be brutally honest, I certainly wouldn't order from here again.  My husband and I ordered form P3 using GrubHub - that was pretty convenient, but that's where the convenience stops.  In the comments section, I gave very specific directions on locating my apartment.  The delivery driver didn't follow them and, instead, went to the front office of the apartment complex.  The complex is gated, so I had to go to the front office to let the delivery driver in, as opposed to him actually delivering the food.  Upon returning the the apartment, my husband pointed out that the driver left out part of our order.  If that weren't bad enough, the food will certainly add to the brutality of this review.  The garlic bread appeared to be yeast rolls covered in butter and sprinkled with garlic powder and mixed herbs (like Mrs. Dash).  We ordered several different foods to have a variety.    The salads were uninspired and bordered on tasteless.  The cheese sticks tasted as if they were half-way baked in an oven.  The pasta was drenched in sauce and coated in cheese... I love cheese, so that was nice.  Part of the pasta, though, was left uncovered while being reheated and, as a result, had nearly reverted to it's uncooked state.  Given the price I paid for this food and the delivery, I would have expected something of much, much higher quality.  I am profoundly disappointed and will not be returning.  I suspect from the reviews I have seen on here that dining in the restaurant results in a profoundly different experience... so I wouldn't discourage that.  If, however, you're planning to order online for delivery, don't."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the area..the delivery driver Andy is awesome, very courteous.i eat pats twice a week if not more."}
{"text":"My family and I have been ordering the twin tower special since I was 6 years old. Going on 30 years old, I order it for my little family and it's as delicious as when I was 6. Another thing I get is the lunch special , 2 slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $4. Great deal, great pizza!"}
{"text":"I was at Pat's Pizza the other day, and was amazed how good the food was.  As a New Yorker who had just about any kind of pizza from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, etc., I'll tell you, Pat's Pizza is one of the BEST!  Of course, I found out later that the owner, Joe is actually from New York, and used to own Number One Pizza in Port Chester, which was my favorite place when I was growing up.  Small world.   If you're living in Pheonix areas, do yourself a favor, stay away from Domino's, Papa John's, or all of these franchise places, unless you don't know any better. It's just not worth it.  Take a ride to this Mom & Pop Place and give them a try.  Well, I'll be back again on my next visit in Pheonix....."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place or the pizza. The sauce was nothing special and the crust was rather thin and hard. I go because there is a lunch special of 2 slices of plain cheese pizza and a soda for $3. Its fine for a quick meal but nothing spectacular. The people are nice and I am always glad to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Man, I had a heck of a day today. Moving. Fun stuff. After two days of backbreaking work, I finally get home and the missus says enthusiuastically: \"what're we gonna do for dinner tonight?\" Well I HAD planned on sitting on my butt and watching the television for dinner, but since that's clearly not going to work for everyone involved, I asked her what she was interested in. \"Wings,\" came the reply. This has generally meant a trip to NYPD ever since my dear Rosie McCaffrey's let me down in the wing department. Oh God, so far. I really just don't have a drive to Biltmore in me. So naturally, I turned to yelp. Turns out, there's a little four-star joint like a mile from my house. The very Web 3.0-named Pat's Pizza Plus (I would have given them five stars if they were named Pat's Pizza Plus Plus, har har). So I read the reviews, and prepare to slog through crap service to get my lazy pizza and wings. On the phone, I'm greeted by a pleasant voice who takes my order swiftly. Hm, that's not supposed to happen. Didn't sound like he was from New York either. I'm getting suspicious...  Well folks, I'm here to tell ya - this is some good pizza and wings. Excellent pizza and wings. And the owners - toiling away in the back - looked like typical New Yorkers to me. You know, Big Lugs. Bling. I won't be making any more trips to Biltmore. These guys are about eight dollars cheaper for a large pizza and a dozen wings than those other guys, and while I don't think they're *quite* as good, they're definitely good enough!  My main complaint is a common one - their \"hot\" wings aren't that hot. I know I stand alone on this issue, but I like an option for some serious hot on my hot wings.   I do believe that the signage as others have mentioned is a little off-putting. It's almost as if they have one dude whose full-time job is to look around, find stuff to get ticked off about and then write a big sign about it in block letters and stick it on the wall. Don't scratch your nose. Don't look at the cooks funny. Don't listen to Coldplay. Sadly, Coldplay was on when I went in, so that last one is just me wishful thinking. Anyway, I think that people who are REALLY upset about these signs have probably never been to New York City. They like to do that sort of thing there. The rest of us can just stare at our iPhones, pick up the delicious pizza and wings, and run back to our sign-free homes. What's that, dear? Crap. I forgot to put the remote on the charger. She hates it when I do that. Put a sign up and everything."}
{"text":"First off, I don't get the reviews that imply the staff is rude.  Everyone went out of their way to be nice to me.  Next, it is hard to get through on the phone.  I ended up placing my order in person and waiting.  I ordered a stuffed pizza which takes longer, and even on Friday it was only 25 or so minutes.  As for the pizza, it's just good.  I'm admittedly no foodie, but I liked it and will be back time and again.  I recommend......"}
{"text":"I haven't been back in a while, but I really like this place.  When my parents had a place over at the Pointe at Squaw Peak, I was in search of good NY pizza.   I stumbled upon this place back in 96 and loved it!  I think there are plenty of other quality pizza joints out here now that are as good, if not better, but I would not hesitate for a second visiting Pat's."}
{"text":"Love supporting the local mom and pop establishments...had lunch with a friend...tried the chicken parm sandwich...nom nom...just like mom made...recommend Pat's if u have a chance to stop by."}
{"text":"Staying at The Pointe Hilton had a craving for pizza. This place was worth the call and they delivered right to our room. Better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns if you want something different. We had the large pizza and wings special for about $25 and added the New York White with a total of $48. The wing hot sauce is so good and the pepperoni had a good flavor also. I gave it 5 stars because it seems like this place is underrated."}
{"text":"BEST NY PIZZA IN AZ HANDS DOWN!!!! I am a huge fan of Buono's in Mesa, but I am now a Pat's Pizza Plus #1 fan....The gentleman at the counter was extremely friendly and gave me a stamp card and menu....The pizza is greasy, but it's sooooo delicious! I asked for Extra cheese and they do not skimp out! It's so fresh and the crust is cooked to perfection! Why would anyone go to places like Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut when there are delicious hidden gems like this in the valley! Don't waste your time on those changes and support your local businesses! The food is way better anyway!! :-)"}
{"text":"Is this New York? Nope, I'm in Phoenix. I can tell because the sun just burned off a few of my eyelashes. However, one bite of Pat's pizza and I'd swear I'm in NYC enjoying a slice before jumping on the A train to my $2,000/month, 6th floor walk-up, 140 sqft studio apartment (what a bargain!). Really, it's that good. I guess Phoenix water is just as good as New York City's water when it comes to making pizza. Now if I could just find a great bagel."}
{"text":"First time ordering and paying on the Yelp site but certainly not my first meal from Pat's. I think its the best Pizza in town. The crust is amazing. Great staff and fast delivery. My go to for pizza in Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'll start this review out by stating that I prefer Chicago style pizza over New York, but I will eat either.   My family and I always enjoy trying new places, especially new pizza places. Pats was one that we tried once, and will never try again. Let me state my story.  So one night, I decided that we should try Pat's Pizza Plus. I called ahead, ordered 1 large pepperoni pizza. They said that it would take about thirty minutes, so I waited a while and drove there. I got there thirty minutes from that time, and was told my pizza was not ready yet. So I sat and waited in their tiny lobby. Eventually, my overpriced pizza was ready, and I drove home.  I set the pizza on my counter, opened the box and looked inside. This thing looked terrible. There were literally POOLS of grease. I understand, New york style pizza, But this was ridiculous. So I grabbed a paper towel or 10, patted down both the top and the bottom of the pizza, and made it bearable.  I took a bite of the pizza and literally had to tear at it like a wolf to even get a mouthful off of the slice. It was very similar to trying to eat cardboard. It was ridiculous. Myself, My father, and my Mother didn't even make it through our first slices before throwing the \"pizza\" away and looking elsewhere for food. Apparently the crust is one of Pat's strong suits, but how the heck could you even make it to the crust when it's like that? I wasn't about to go for it.   Honestly, if this happened to me again, I'd definitely take the pizza back to them and demand my money back. I've had pizza from Little Caesars that blew that pizza away. Maybe I just got a bad pizza, but any time I hear the name Pat's Pizza, I want to vomit and I recommend elsewhere.   Good luck with this place.."}
{"text":"Giving these guys a five because the were so friendly and the pizza was great.  We had the margherriti pizza.  It had a a good flavor.  The extra crispy wings were good too.  If you want a small local place come here and help them out.  The prices were good also."}
{"text":"Delicious Sicilian pizza! With the exact texture crust a sicilian slice should have.  I moved here from NY and this is my go-to place for my monthly (sometimes more:/ ) pizza fix."}
{"text":"We had their lunch special pizza and their wings. Pizza reminded me of the NYC style think crust and large very delicious! Wings were cooked good with hot and medium buffalo sauce, wish they had other sauces...but it tasted delicious. The food was great and the owner Justin was very accommodating and made sure all our questions were answered."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. If you are from New York then this is the pizza joint you have been looking for!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza I have ever had. I tried this place today for the first time despite living in the area for more than a year. It's football Sunday, why not grab some pizza. It's not that anything was particularly bad, but the pizza had no flavor. None. This place makes frozen pizza look good. I got a large sausage and olive. The sausage, olive, cheese, and sauce had no flavor. It's beyond bland. Go elsewhere, including the chains and the frozen pizza section of Safeway before you try this. It's just not good, and for the price it needs to be."}
{"text":"Nice guys, but that doesn't help the pizza taste any better. The slices are reheated in their oven before being served to you, the crust is rock-hard and has a bit of a cardboard taste and their sauce and cheese lack flavor. The portion size is decent, but large portions of subpar food is just more subpar food. Disappointed in the quality, and the fact that they charge you for refills of your drink and nickel and dime you for a small, pre-measured, and awful tasting side of ranch dressing, or other condiment. Not impressed, nor a fan. :-("}
{"text":"We ordered a half sausage half pep and a dinner salad for delivery. It came pretty fast (about 30 minutes) and was still warm, which is a huge plus in my book. The crust is very, very good although I would like a little more sauce. The sausage wasn't your typical crumbled sausage; it was sliced sausage, which tastes slightly different. I was hoping for crumbled sausage but it was still really good! The dinner salad came with two rolls and two dressing containers. I give it 4 starts because the salad was a little lacking. It was lettuce, onion, and tomato; I was hoping for at least a couple of cucumber slices but that's ok. Great place to order from."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! I always get pepperoni, mushroom, and garlic! And they don't skimp on the garlic! Breath is horrible but I love it!! So good!!!!! Keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza and wings. It was delish! Very good flavors! Delivery was very fast!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but pretty skimpy on the sauce. And the spices were on top of toppings and should've been on or in sauce. Skimpy on cheese also."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood pizza by the slice! Love their crust! Hit the spot. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"PPP is hands down the best delivery pie in Arizona hands down. I have been picking up pizza's from this place for the last 25 years and it never lets me down. IMO, Pats is in a different category of pizza places in the era of Napolitan-style pizza is the on-going trend. However, for delivery pizza, that is non \"gourmet\", Pats is the only place to go."}
{"text":"It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore. And after reading all these reviews, Im wondering if I just went on a bad night? But good restaurants shouldnt have \"bad nights\" right? Aside from the friendly service over the phone, nothing was worth going back for. My bf is a huge ricotta fan so I decided to order the ny white pizza and some garlic bread. The gentleman over the phone told me 25min and I showed up in 20. Everything was ready and I walked in and out within one minute. I shouldve known instantly that something wasnt right. One thing i love about oreganos is that they show you the pizza before you walk out. When i got in the car and looked at the pizza, the cheese was already crusted solid on top, showing that it had been sitting under a heater for maybe 10min or so. By the time I got home (a few blocks away), my pizza was room temperture, the cheese on top was rock hard and i couldnt taste ANYTHING but GARLIC GARLIC GARLIC. Super disappointing. Back to Oregano's we go...."}
{"text":"Meh.pizza was super greasy,cheese was gummy,crust was bland. $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all. Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius. Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's. Never again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Sicilian crust pepperoni pizza.  Service was very friendly.  Pizza was enormous and under $20.  The mozzarella and sauce were of good quality, though too light for the very thick crust.  The pepperoni was thin but fine.  The crust was not as tasty as I remembered, and didn't have the crispy, buttery goodness of a deep dish pizza.  The crust was rather chewy as well as lacking much flavor.    The upside to the large amount of crust (compared to the toppings) is that the pizza was on the lighter side, not leaving that gross greasy feeling you get after eating Pizza Hut's pan pizza.  This was even when I didn't mop up the excess surface oil (incidentally, leaving the slice oily helped the flavor a little).  The parking lot was less crazy on the Paradise Bakery side in the evening, so I would recommend parking there, and definitely further away from the popular Zoyo."}
{"text":"Pretty good to come grab a slice nothing special though it was your average New York style thinner crust crispy which is good cheese was decent wasn't too chewy sauce was little Bland guy at the counter was real friendly definitely your mom and pop neighborhood joint next time I want to try their wings or something else they have on the menu will be back soon"}
{"text":"YUM!  Maybe it's just because we had extra sauce and extra cheese added to our pizza, but it was AMAZING.  Thick crust, flavorful sauce, tons of cheese - and they deliver?!  I'm in heaven.  *Update:  We are outside of their delivery area.  : ("}
{"text":"not at all the place I recall!  so disappointing, Went there on super bowl Sunday and ate in instead of having it delivered,  our pizza was so overloaded with stuff we could not even pick it up.  fresh mushrooms???? nope out of a can with the juice I might add.  no one asked how we liked our meal so when I tried to volunteer the info the waiter stated he hears complaints all the time and doesn't know what to tell me. Don't worry- I can tell myself and others--- don't waste your time, money or day offfrom work to go here.  Pats pizza is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"The inside seating is limited and can get crowded during peak times.  Might need to do some shuffling around to get out if you're in the corner.    The lunch special (11am-2pm) here is really cheap.  You get two cheese pizza slices and a drink for $3.00 + tax.  It's additional if you want to add toppings."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly wonderful! We stopped in for a quick bite and I'm so glad we did! It's a quaint little family pizzeria."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and wings, not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request, I'm surprised he doesn't charge for the use of napkins.... Maybe that's next."}
{"text":"Pat's is pretty damn good. Good pizza, GREAT wings.   I really don't like going in there.  A previous poster mentioned the love/hate relationship Pat's seems to have with it's customers. Passive-aggressive signs are literally everywhere you turn. No bills larger than $20. If you didn't buy it here don't eat it here. Please close the door behind you. Don't steal the magazines. Even on the website and all capped and pissed off;  Please HAVE YOUR ORDER READY ordering delivery. Please have your credit card number READY. Last deliveries of the night are CASH ONLY!! Okay I get it, pizza nazi.  It's very off-putting. Have a little faith in your customers, we're not all assholes."}
{"text":"Ordered both types (regular and Sicilian) of pizzas they have and both of them were almost too bad to eat.  I'll be throwing the leftovers away. The Sicilian was greasy and bland, the regular was bland and chewy.  Now, there lasagna and subs and such may be good... but the pizza was not.  If you're still interested.. they do have a website:  http://www.patspizzaplus.com/"}
{"text":"Never approach a Bull from the front, a Horse from the rear, or a chain pizza joint from any direction. If you had grown up in Phoenix and are over 40 we've all seen good pizza places come and go. Shakeys, Village inn, Genos, Dego Dan, etc.  But through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time some old time pizza joints stay in business. Pat's is one of these. 2nd to my all time favorite Riazzis in Tempe I encourage all of you to give them a try.   This place is extremely busy so call ahead to take out or eat in and don't forget the mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Central Phoenix! The sauce is perfectly mild and not overly used, perfect amount of cheese and perfect crust texture of chewy/crunchy. Love me some Pats!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I found this place through yelp. I travel in north phoenix for work so I let yelp find a lunch I could order and pick up. I didn't have much time so this option is great. I showed up 5 minutes later and the gentlemen was reading my ticket. I said I know I'm early but ill go to the rest room next door. Very small restaurant, I didn't see where one could be. The gentlemen showed me and said, please use ours, very friendly. I came back and sat down and watched a family eating get their pizza, it looked awesome! I got my meatball sub to go. It was wrapped in foil and very warm. Pickle spear also came with. Delicous , crunchy toasted cheesy, tender meatballs! Best one I've eaten lately.  I will return when I'm in the area. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've tasted! The sicilian is yum and it weighs a ton."}
{"text":"R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP."}
{"text":"This little hole in wall joint never disappoints.  The food is good and the friendly service better.   The prices are reasonable. The pizza and wings special is great. 22 bucks and  some change for a large with 2 toppings and 30 wings!"}
{"text":"They're right up the street from us, so we gave it a shot. Tried their wings and pizza, and we dug both.  Crust is good, not too chewy, not too thick, which are two things I absolutely hate. Cheese is pretty good, not too oily and cheap. Sauce is so-so, and toppings are just OK. But overall, we liked it. Surprisingly good pizza.   Wings are pretty good, too. Not one of them was crispy, but apart from that, solid. Good sauce, not too oily.   Will likely go back every once in awhile, as $30 for wings and pizza is definitely on the higher side of what I would pay for what they offer, which is my biggest gripe."}
{"text":"I was working around 12st St. and Glendale Ave and was looking for a place to grab a quick lunch.   There aren't too many places that are quick unless you want a fast good chain. But after a quick search I found Pats Pizza Plus.  I got the lunch special that had the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a coke. I added ham to one and pepperoni to the other. The soft drinks they offer are coke products.  The food we ordered came out fast! The quality of the pizza was great. Its a New York style pizza, cheezy and a nice crispy crust and not too much sauce.   Pats also has alot of other dishes that are on the menu and hope to one day try.  If your looking for a quick bite and are in the area of 12st St. and Glendale Pats Pizza Plus is yout place."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings ive had in awhile! Very small establishment but the service is great and the Christmas spirit is in the air. Happy to have stumbled upon it!"}
{"text":"My husband had a taste for pizza and found Pats Pizza on Yelp and decided to it  since it was in the neighborhood and delivered.  Well lets just say we do not plan to order anymore pizza from here.  In our opinion,  the pizza contained a lot of bread and very little of everything else.  The pizza looks like toasted texas toast bread with some toppings on it.  I would recommend viewers to try for themselves though.  We really love Rosatis Pizza but is too far a distance and maybe we had too high of expectations when going to Pats."}
{"text":"The two slice special is a good deal. I ordered it for my son. The pizza had a good flavor. I ordered the chicken fettuccine. The texture and taste of the sauce was horrible. I felt like I was eating fettuccine noodles with a runny mayonnaise. I couldn't and didn't eat it."}
{"text":"I tried Pat's for the first time this evening and I was pleasantly surprised!! The service was friendly and the pizza was fantastic!! The best pizza I have had here in Phoenix!! I would highly recommend going to Pat's!! I will definitely being going back!! :)"}
{"text":"Want to grab a few slices for lunch; also wanted to try based on a recommendation from a co-worker...I'm glad I did; the slices were great - I cannot wait to try a whole pizza or some of the wings, and pasta!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. Just make sure you're on your A game - like other people have said, there are so. many. rules. I've never caught attitude from an employee, but they've got me terrified."}
{"text":"Pat's has the best wings in the valley! Some of my favorite NYC style crust. Everything here is great! Sorry... my fingers are too saucy to type!!!"}
{"text":"I had food delivered. It arrived before the time it said it would. That was the only good thing about it. The mozzarella sticks were cold. I had to reheat them. The salad that comes with the pasta had more onions on it the lettuce. The fettucini Alfredo pasta tasted like sour cream. The garlic bread was not good. Never gonna order from there again."}
{"text":"Great wings & pizza! They are clearly a small mom & pop restaurant, once when I went to pick up food i could hear people fighting about prices and whatnot in the back and they just all seemed stressed out (They were very busy due to football games). Not something a customer should ever see, take those convo's into the office. Also they told me they could not make my wings \"Extra\" crispy since they were so busy, first time i have been told that by a pizza joint! All in all though, good food, decent service."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple of pizzas from Pats Pizza Plus; a pepperoni with mushrooms, and a sausage with black olives.  The pepperoni smelled bad and was not edible.  The sausage was meh.  The cardboard the pizza was in probably would taste about the same as the pizza.  I wanted to like this place because it is in the neighborhood.  We now call it Pat's Pizza P00p."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for a quick no frills cheap lunch.  Two slices and a soda for just over $3 and that pizza is actually good!  the only issue this place has is with parking.  Ever since Paradise Bakery opened in the same complex you usually can't find a parking spot after 11:30.    If you have a chance you should give this locally owned non-franchise spot a try."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, hot wings and meatball sandwich. All deliver well and fast. Very consistent."}
{"text":"We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!"}
{"text":"Being a girl from the east coast I couldn't find a pizza like back home! I came across this place while getting frozen yogurt and figured I would give it a try! And I'm so happy I did! The pizza and wings are amazing!!! If your from jersey or NY I would definitely suggest this place! My kids love it I love it my fianc√© loves it!!! Hands down best pizza in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and his family have been coming here since 1982. We haven't been here in a few years so we decided to see if it was as great as  he remembered it to be. Well, we were very disappointed. It was not as good as he or I remembered. In the early 80's and 90's this place was good. The pizza was awesome and the inside of the restaurant had some charm. That is definitely not the case now. The pizza was extremely bland and not very flavorful at all. We decided to try the wings but backed out after trying the sauce. It was very vinegary. Seems like the quality of the food has changed and the inside is just like the pizza.......boring. After so many generations of eating at Pats, we will have to say goodbye."}
{"text":"I did give Pat's 5 stars, but there is one thing that I really hate and it just drives me crazy!  The food is too good that I don't know what to choose!  The pizza is just as good as any pizza place in NYC.  The appetizers and wings are fantastic.  If you have a appetite of a horse, you need to try the DiVinci.  It is a meal with three pastas!  You can eat there, but I prefer delivery.  After eating Pat's I can't get up from off my seat."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am not a fan of franchise pizza and this place has a great pie in my opinion.  Definitely a repeat customer!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time a couple of days ago. Although delivery was quick, I was disappointed that they use canned and not fresh vegetables. With so many other solid pizza joints here in Phoenix this place falls way short."}
{"text":"I love pats! My friends and I have been going there since high school for the amazing lunch special, back in 2001 it was $2.50 for two slices(that are huge) and a drink, and today I think it costs like $4, def a hot deal. This is also the fianc√© and I's go-to pizza delivery spot. Best ny style pizza in Phoenix in my opinion. Always friendly and the delivery is typically quicker than the time they quote you. When doing delivery ordering the pizza well done helps the crust to hold its integrity since sometimes it can be a tiny bit soggy by the time it gets to you. Wings extra crispy bc crispy wings are the best! Keep up the good work Pat's!"}
{"text":"Being a transplant from NYC and a big fan of pizza and hot wings, I must say that Pat's has been my go to here in PHX. The crust is unbelievably good, even the dry outside crust is a treat. If you feel like indulging in some meaty greatness, you have get their specialty, The Bensonhurst Blast, every meat topping imaginable with garlic and onions. May not be diet friendly, but you have to treat yourself once in a while. Perfect thing to impress your beer drinking buddies."}
{"text":"I asked for a easy special request extra crispy wings sauce on the side, I repeated it twice on the phone & she acknowledged my request. Get home & it was exactly what I didn't want AND the sauce is a bit sweet and to top it off I spent real $ on that food I couldn't eat and won't get it back or got a Gil belly"}
{"text":"Quality control seems to have disappeared here.  The crust is a disaster these days... and they're really slow... 45 minutes is too long to wait for a casual, mom & pop pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza and wings! My only complaint is that you can't order flats only. My honey and I only like flats so it kind of sucks but it's nice not having to have to order extra crispy wings and still not get soggy wings!  Update: We've now been able to order flats only."}
{"text":"They gave me 3 slices in this tiny ass box wtf. Pizza isn't meant to be stacked. Pizza should make you feel happy,  but I only feel disrespected."}
{"text":"Pat's Pizza is so good that it hurts.  I went for the first time last week, and I don't think a second has gone by since that I didn't wish I was eating it.  Like we finished, left, got in the car, and I thought to myself, \"I could really go for some Pat's Pizza right now!\"  I didn't like one thing (but not enough to dock a star):  Signs, signs, everywhere there's signs.  Signs that show an owner who has a truly love/hate relationship with his customers.  I know the general public can be a pain in the ass, but I don't like seeing 5 million signs telling me basically \"behave\".  My mama taught me right, ok Pat?  But who cares?  Not me.  Delicious, perfect, mouthwatering, decadent, delightful, wonderful, amazing (my thesaurus has run out) pizza will keep me coming back over and over again, as many times as humanly possible."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place, my mouth began to water.  The aroma in here just cant be beat.  I ordered the special - 1 16\" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings.  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions.  I lamented this topping combo, but it was what my girlfriend wanted.  I got the wings hot, also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it out.  When I opened the wing box, the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water.  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter.  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house.  The next time I am in the area, I will try it out.  I took the pizza home and cracked open the box.  The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand.  The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.  The calzones were great as well, smothered in marinara sauce.  The price was great, the people were friendly.  The lunch special can't be beat.  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda, 50 cent refills)  Negotiate the construction outside, find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza.  My only regret was that I had to share it.  Next time - its all mine."}
{"text":"Yikes, I had delivery and everything was gross. The produce tasted like it came out of a can. The pizza was bad, everything tasted old and the sauce had a bad flavor. The chicken wings were gummy, the ranch was very sour- not sure if it was bad or if that was the flavor they were going for. I tried a bite of everything then had to throw it away - it was inedible. My boyfriend who eats everything couldn't even eat the food."}
{"text":"Do not go into the bathroom. I repeat, do not go into the bathroom.  (There are likely rest stops nicer).  Do go however for awesome pizza and calzones.  They take Pino's Pizza (3rd and Central) and kick their ass.  It is homemade, the crust pops and sizzles.  The marinara served on the side could use a little more oomph, but the slice.  The slice is a thing of beauty.  Oh and a slice will cost you $2.22.  Another thing of beauty.  Ignore the fact that it is a dive, or revel in the fact that it is a dive.  But keep this neighborhood place in the rotation.  There aren't enough mom and pop places out there that we can support.  It's sandwiched between a zoyo and a paradise bakery for cripe's sake."}
{"text":"I had forgotten about this place but I worked in the area in my early twenties and some coworkers and I would frequent this place for their awesome lunch specials.    I came here recently while staying  Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak at the for an alternative to the terrible frozen pizza they serve.  Call it in, 8 mins round trip from the hotel. Delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I have had this in my \"to try\" list for a long time... not really long enough :(  I stopped in for a lunch special...2 slices and a drink for like $4.00 or so... BUT they only accept debit over $5.00 Then make the damn special $5 bucks! I had to add a third slice just so I could eat there. LAME  The pizza was thin, no sauce and topped nice with cheese. The entire thing was flavorless. NONE not the sauce or the crust.   The service was all over the place (not in a good way) the building was roasting hot, and there was an old guy with his Pee Bag hanging out there while eating. (no stars deducted for that)  Over all... I doubt I would be back."}
{"text":"I ordered 5 large pizzas for a party I had last weekend and they were great.  I popped in early in the day and placed my order.  The pizzas were hot and ready on time.  We got a variety of pizzas and they were really good.  The spicy chicken pesto was the biggest hit.  Totally perfect for the party.  All my friends were asking about the place I ordered from.  They have awesome wings too.  Plus, everyone that works there is so nice... the type of neighborhood place you always want to order from."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but great service- I ordered the lunch special. Pizza was excellent but does take a few minutes to come out. I would return"}
{"text":"Pats pizza is very good. In fact this should be a 5 star, but they sent the wrong pizza on delivery. It was later in the evening aroun 730p and the gf wakes up at 3a for work, so to delay dinner for the correct one was out of the picture. The next time we order it came perfect. I probably would of even gave them 5star if the driver or business would of apologized for the mistake.. instead i got just a ..well u want me to take it back.  That is my only complaint..otherwise pizza was great.   We will try them out again..and maybe check out some other items off the menu."}
{"text":"A hidden gem over on Glendale and 12st. Great pizza! Great little place!! One of our favorites!!"}
{"text":"Good little local pizza place.  We got the Twin Tower special which was a 16\" 2 topping pizza and 30 wings for 23 bucks.  What was amazing was this pizza was a huge square and a full 16\" .. We opted for the thick crust which I really wasn't crazy about but I'm sure many people would love..it was more of a crunchy toasted kinda crust.  Wings were really good and service was very friendly and attentive. I would go back to try the thin crust and some of their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"***Update*** So after visiting this place again today, to grab some lunch to go, I have to bump up my 4 stars to 5. The little strip mall where Pat's sits is under renovation, but they're taking it in stride. And I still got my 2 slices with topping and drink for under $4. I don't care that they forgot my pepperoni at first and I had to wait a whole 45 seconds or so. The pizza is just really good, the staff is friendly, and it is such a deal. And I never get tired of reading the randomly odd stuff on the walls... like how Sean McLaughlin stopped there for a slice after getting married... or a Xerox certification of Elvis' check for the purchase of three Caddys... or the poster for the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Just odd stuff, but I did learn today that they have a catering menu too.   A huge thank you to my friend Tina, for fronting me cash after I realized I didn't have any. They still don't run plastic under $5. Oh yeah, and after Tina went on and on about how she doesn't often find pizza she likes, I got an IM from her later... \"yummy pep pizza\". Yes, it is. :)   _________________________________________________  My hubby introduced me to this hole-in-the-wall joint. For under $4, you get a lunch special with two YUMMY slices, one topping each, and a drink. I like peno's... they came freshly chopped, sans seeds and membranes. My nose was melting, but I was happy to not get the usual pickled rings. No one I've brought here has said anything other than wow. Bring cash if only getting one special; they have $5 debit/charge minimum."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza with a crispy crust the bottom of the pizza could be little crisper.  Only 12 or 16 inch. A little pricey depending on what you get.. they do have good deals though"}
{"text":"I grew up on Pat's Pizza and I can't think of anything else I would have rather eaten for the past 20 years.  Yes, the staff is not usually too friendly, yes, there are signs everywhere telling you what you can and can't do, and yes, they don't like it when you use a debit card.  However, none of that matters once you take a bite of their heavenly NY style pizza.  The smattering of sauce is bright red against the perfectly thin, white crust, and the cheese is loaded with herbs and toppings.  It's not too sweet and not too doughy.  It's consistent and mouthwateringly delicious.  PLUS, you can bring your own beer and get too drunk to even see the 1,000 signs bossing you around.  I used to live right down the street from Pat's, but now, sadly, I have to drive 22 miles once a month just to get my fix.  It doesn't matter... I'd drive 500 miles for a slice of Pat's."}
{"text":"Sicilian-Style Pizza was a complete joke.  Adding $5 to the price of a regular crust pizza for the worst cardboard bread ever??  Too bad it was a take-out order and I live more than 10 miles away from this joint.  It would have been sent back if the first bite of cardboard occurred in-house. Wings = decent.  Basically a 1.5 if there were half stars."}
{"text":"I've lived within walking distance for over a year and just had the chance to try it when I was treated to an early lunch last Saturday via madre.  Two big, thin slices of a cheese pizza and an excellent cannoli for under $6 can't be beat. Mom got her slices with a generous portion of mushrooms for an extra fee and a cannoli for herself. Add in a soda and totaled at just under $12 for a filling, yummy lunch. Must remember this place next time I get pizza and support local business instead of Papa John's!"}
{"text":"Delicious New York-style pizza, with hearty calzones and spicy hot wings. Pat's Pizza Plus has all the heart and soul of a local Italian pizzeria, while at the same time providing the chic convenience that a modern suburban pizza parlor should offer!   This location is situated in a strip mall, right next door to a Panera. There is plenty of parking out front, and the Pat's Pizza sign is large and easy to spot out from afar.   The interior design is nostalgia inducing. The red and white checkered tablecloths call dedicated reverence to the vintage pizza parlor environment. The feeling is unique and cozy, inviting and comforting.  One of their daily specials that I'd like to mention is the Large two-topping pizza with 30 wings (yes, that's 30 wings) for $29.99 with tax. The wings were fresh and crispy, bursting with buffalo flavor and spice. They were rather small in comparison to Native or BWW, yet they were very satisfying and had me wanting another one!   The pizza is a thin crust with ample portions of toppings. It tasted like a slightly higher quality version of Peter Piper Pizza. Although I love PPP, their pizza has a nostalgic taste of cheap cardboard ingredients, rather than fresh and vibrate flavors.  Sorry to say, but the dough to cheese to sauce ratio was slightly lacking as well.   All in all, I would recommend this pizza spot over any franchised pizza location in the area!"}
{"text":"10/15/2013: Not going back. Ever.   Here's how I rate a pizza: is it better the 2nd day?  Well, I've got good news and bad news.  First, the bad news:  I've visited Pat's Pizza about 20 times in the past year (12 St and Glendale Ave, Phoenix) and the food is good.  Not great, good.  A good value, or so I thought.  But CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THE 2ND DAY!  But that's not the bad news. The bad news is, I called in an order one night a few weeks ago, and they emphasized that they close at 9 and that I'd have to absolutely be there by 9.  No problem.  But then the guy, with the broad bitching in the background (and I'm not joking), reiterated - AGAIN! That I HAD to be there by 9pm.   I got there at precisely 8:54pm, but was horrified to realize, in my haste to \"get there by 9pm-NO LATER!, I'd forgotten my wallet.  Sheesh.  Wasn't intentional.  But you should have seen, actually seen, the look of horror and disgust on the faces of these two schlubs.  After numerous visits, this guy knew me; the point is, I'm not hustling anyone, if I say I'll come back, I will.  There was not a hint of empathy, \"it's ok, catch me later\", nothing.  Nothing for a regular customer, which is what I was.  I looked at the guy and said something like, \"Well, if I HAD to be here by 9, I guess there's no chance I can go home and get my wallet\".  Again, looks of disgust.  Silence.  Disgusted slience.   So I said, \"It's ok.  It's my mistake.  And I'll never come back\".  And I left.  But the good news is, because Pat's wouldn't trust me, allow me to pay later for the pizza, I was forced to find a new place...and I did!  That's how I found Raffaele's Pizzeria, 7019 N 19th Ave (NE corner, 19th Avenue and Glendale). This is terrific pizza and it's better the 2nd day.  I'll write a separate review for Raffaele's but know that now, for sure, I really never will go back to Pat's.  Assholes just had to get out of there by 9...  Way to go Pat's.  How many customers do you have that come in 20 times in 6 months?  I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy with that horrible woman who looked so disgusted that night.  I hope you're married to that horrible woman.  I just wonder what they did with my pizza..."}
{"text":"I like Pat's Pizza Plus!   Its not the best pizza I have ever had, but its not the worst either. Its just right there in the middle good pizza.   The crust is always perfect, that sauce is always delightful. I like to eat in and get a small side salad (while the salad is a bit lacking you get these glorious little rolls made from heaven)   Like one yelp-er said, all the off putting signs are a bit much, but I have also witnessed the type of clientele that go in there and have been tempted a few times to bitch slap someone for their oblivious rudeness to the employees of Pat's."}
{"text":"If I could could give a negative star I would! By far the worst! I'd like to know what part of NY they claim to represent.. it would seem that their version of eggplant Parmesan is not breaded or fried... just boiled eggplant slices with a watery sauce on the spaghetti!! Big disappointment !! The Stromboli is more like a calzone which they claim to sell wonder what that is? Costco lasagne puts this to shame ! The fettuccine  was  like cottage cheese on noodles! 60 worth of garbage! Never again!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Best pizza on my side of town. Great lunch deal and friendly service. Hot sandwiches are pretty good here too!"}
{"text":"I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day."}
{"text":"Best pie in the valley. From the crust to the sauce to the cheese. Hands down, best in town."}
{"text":"Yelp totally led me wrong here!  This place is relatively inexpensive, but I didn't find the atmosphere charming or fun and the pizza tastes like something from a school cafeteria.    Granted, all I tried was one pizza but it really stood out as a place to avoid in a neighborhood with plenty of fantastic pizza and other Italian food."}
{"text":"Oh man! How I love me some Pat's! Inexpensive, and crazy tasty. Stop in for a slice of pizza the size of your head for a super reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, great crust! Tasty sauce and light on the cheese, just what I like. The 2 slice special is a deal, comes with a drink!"}
{"text":"They don't mention that they have the best ice cream yogurt you serve yourself. I really ought to advertise that because that's what most people come in there for as an ice cream shop. Yes the food is good and the people who work there are nice usually only one or two people on at a time. And the atmosphere is just pretty basic I mean it's a hard floor and hard chairs that are festive looking and they have some outside too. They have a couple of electronic advertising boards inside. I guess they have 14 locations I don't know where they are but there must be hidden but they're excellent for an ice cream parlor."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the state.  Just enough crust lots of meat and fresh fresh veggies.  Oh yeah the sauce is amazing, they don't soak the pizza.  Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Real NY pizza! It is the best slice that I have found outside of NYC. The owners and staff are warm and friendly and take pride in their work. Their lasanga is great as well.  I have been a loyal regular for over a year and am so glad I finally walked in to give Pat's a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a small and simple place that happens to make incredible pizza!  The crust is thin and crispy with a flavor that reminds me of Pizza in New York. They offer many specials. I ordered for pick up and it was ready when I got there. They were very nice and I will be having their pizza many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Again super delicious wings. They did my order perfectly. Very nice people too. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This joint is cool. Small. Tucked away on Glendale avenue between 7th street and 12th. Never too fancy or too dumpy. I wish I remembered the name of the dude who is always there. Seemingly. I been prolly 6 times. They got this guy at the front lines. Always straight up but mad friendly and approachable. You will meet/talk with him at some point. Pizza is what it is. I work in a medical office so some ppl say it is a little too greasy. Take that for what it is. Fried Zuccs are  long cut.. not chips. They have lunch specials so check it out. All in all ,from the food to the service, pretty awesome spot."}
{"text":"I went with two New Yorkers who agreed that this little, hole-in-the-wall place is the closest Phoenix comes to NY style pizza. We had the slice special and were very happy. We're going to try them for take-out next."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it's amazing. I have ordered pepperoni pizza with mushrooms both times and the mushrooms were very good. The wings are delicious and crispy too. I ordered on Super Bowl Sunday on a whim about an hour before the game and it came within 45 minutes. Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Pat's has great NY style pizza, fresh ingredients and will make it to your liking. They put the basil on after cooking the pizza without giving me a funny look. Try the meatballs! They are scrumptious!  Their wings are not so hot, they tend to be on the soggy side. Their salads are huge and delicious and there is something magical in the ranch they use.. I get take out here at least twice a month and they have never done me wrong. They have great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"R.I.P.  the founder Pats has recently passed on. It was a blessing the owner and the nice guy at the counter have carried on in his name! Great pizza"}
{"text":"Was heading next store to paradise for a sandwich when I thought I'd try this place instead. I ordered the Italian hoagie toasted with everything. So good! The hoagie took me right back to growing up on the east coast!  Well done Pats your hoagie was perfection. : )"}
{"text":"Don't know how this place has 3 1/2 stars it's always been 5 stars for my husband and I. Excellent pizza and amazing wings and the staff is always awesome. Small place with 7 tables with red and white checkered table cloths.  It's a favorite for date night. We drive from Surprise to eat here."}
{"text":"Lucky to live in the neighborhood. Pats is our go-to pizza place. Nice, fresh dough, not too thin, good toppings (except I wish they would improve the sausage). The dinners also are quite good for take out, especially the chicken parm and ziti. Best of all are the wings. Some of the best I've ever had. Well cooked, crisp, no hint of fat. Service is always friendly. A great neighborhood place"}
{"text":"Got the pizza and wings. Wings were meaty and cooked well and the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and this is the closest thing to NY... sooo good to.   my first time but sure to return.   had the pizza and meatball / Italian sausage grinder."}
{"text":"Having been craving a breakfast burrito all morning and having my dreams dashed I decided to opt for pizza for lunch because I'm an adult and I can do things like that.   I've worked in this area for nearly three years now and have literally driven by this place every day on the way home but never stopped in. Today I decided to change that, and I'm glad I did.  It's small and has a pretty cozy feel to it, and the guy working the counter was super friendly. I got the lunch special  - 2 slices and a drink for like $4 - and added a few toppings to it because let's be honest who besides that dumb kid from Home Alone likes a plain cheese pizza? (No offense if you do like plain cheese pizza I'm sure it's delicious) I only had to wait maybe like 5 minutes and I was out the door. I didn't open the box till I got back to work but when I got out of my car back at my office to head upstairs I could see the grease already soaking through the box. \"This is going to be amazing\" I told myself.   I got to my desk and opened the pizza box and holy mother of god these slices are HUGE. Each one was literally the size of my face. I'm not typically a thin crust kind of gal, but this is just the right amount of thin - it's the type of pizza slice where you just fold that bitch in half and stuff it in your mouth. I will definitely be going back here when my next lunchtime pizza craving hits."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings and very nice people. You can't beat the lunch special for $5.00. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings on point.  Gotti pizza with prosciutto, artichoke hearts and red peppers, so good.  Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"They found \"it\". There are only a handful of places in this town that know how to make pizza. Anyone who would find a problem with this pie needs to get back to their Digiorno's......."}
{"text":"This place is great. I work nearby and when I don't take lunch from home Pat's is always a good option. There lunch special is hard to beat. About $5 for two very big slices and medium size drink. I usually order from work and take out. Very prompt and courteous service. The pizza is on the greasier side but still tasty. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"For all you west sider's out there, Pat's Pizza Plus (say that 3 times fast!) is a great option for cheap pizza. It's just a small little joint in a shopping complex, but they serve up pretty tasty pie.  While there are other, better options for pizza, if you want something quick, cheap and good, I'd go here or have it delivered."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious (and I'm from Chicago and picky about my pizza)! The staff is very courteous, the restaurant is clean, and the food arrived quickly. This is my new favorite pizza place. Buy local!"}
{"text":"Im so bumed out, this place used to be amazing at making the best cheese steak! I cant believe I just paid $12 dollars for a ground beef sandwich. I also was charged for jalapenos that werent even in the sandwich. I want my money back, but i just chucked the dumpseter sandwhich in the trash. Subways cheese steak tastes more authentic."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some pie on way to a game. Ordered take out and although not busy in dining area, did take about 1/2 hr for a pizza and wings.  Pizza not bad, heavy on the sauce yet ok. Wings had a vinegary taste so not my favorite. Ok place yet not sure if will come back."}
{"text":"I tried Pat's yesterday for the first time.  I've seen lots of good reviews on Yelp and have been really hungry for good NY style pizza.  Walking into the place was just like being back home and brought back lots of memories.  The smells were fantastic.  I ordered a large with mushrooms, onions and sausage.  The toppings and the sauce were GREAT !  The crust however did not do much for me.  It seemed like it was cooked too long, as evidenced by the burnt section on one side.  I was looking for the thin, crispy on the bottom, squishy on the top and grease sliding off it.    I think the crust was a fluke so I will definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Quality take out pizza and hot wings.  I order it frequently when I have people over and almost always receive a comment or two about how good the pizza is.  My only gripe is the ranch I've gotten on several occasions was bad/borderline spoiled.  Please be more careful with that as it makes people sick"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite local pizza places for many years.  This evening I ordered the pizza and wing combo and a side salad and was disappointed.  The order arrived quickly but the medium wings were mushy and not hot/spicy at all.  Also, the Wonderful Ranch dip they used to serve is no more.  Instead, it was the pale yellow bottled gunk.   Also, the celery sticks were missing from our order.  Prices are up and quality is down :-("}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever tasted. I love it! The wings are okay, I mostly go there for the pizza. The lunch special is such a deal!! 2 giant slices with 1 or 2 toppings I think and a drink for less than $5. Service is always great, very nice employees and owners. It maybe a tiny hole in the wall pizza joint but it's to die for."}
{"text":"What a let down! Pizza was 15min late from the 40-45m pickup wait, staff was blah, and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky."}
{"text":"We are in town staying at the nearby Squaw Peak Hilton resort. We decided to get delivery and called to order pizza and wings. We ordered a special they had for a large pizza with two toppings plus 30 wings, and added a small Hawaiian pizza. The guy on the phone was VERY nice - we had a lot of questions and requested sauces on the side. Unlike many places you call in an order, he was very friendly, accommodating, patient and helpful. We really appreciated this.  We ordered a large pizza with two toppings - pepperoni on the whole pizza and half of it also with meatballs. This was perfectly executed and tasty. The crust and dough was perfectly cooked - fluffy and fresh with a little crisp. The pepperonis were tasty with the right amount of spice, and the meatballs were flavorful without being spicy. They had a fair amount of black pepper but it wasn't overwhelming. The pepperonis were thinly sliced and laid on top of the cheese and pepperoni - well balanced and easy to eat! The other pizza was a small Hawaiian without sauce --- sadly, it had NO pineapple on it. How do you forget the pineapple on a Hawaiian. Since it was delivery, there was nothing we could do. So, we ate what equated to cheesy bread with Canadian bacon on it.    We also had 30 wings with medium sauce on the side - and ordered them extra crispy. They were perfectly cooked and the medium sauce was good (when getting delivery or to go, getting the sauce on the side keeps them crispy!) It included two small (2 ounce) ramekins of ranch, so we ordered 6 extra (which was only 30 cents each, much cheaper than the nearby Stumpy's cost for ranch).  The Hawaiian (well, cheesy bread with Canadian bacon...) pizza's crust was much thinner and crispier than the large pizza. Just something to note - the crust was completely crusty. Which is fine, just know it wasn't soft like on the large. We were quoted 35-40 mins and paid cash... But it arrived closer to 25 mins. I do recommend this place. Despite the goof on the small pizza, the friendly service, quail delivery and wing quality leaves me with 4 solid stars.  If this review helped, let me know with the voting buttons. It encourages me to post these reviews."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and so happy I found Pats first.   I'm sold! My new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, me and my brother stopped in for lunch and they brought out the slices super quick. It's a great price for the two slice Pizza combo with drink. Plus the slices are huge. This place has been there forever for a reason. Try it out."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ... Ordered off GrubHub, Pats messed up the order, Manager then told me to call GrubHub myself and get a refund. Manager told me that the app was really poor in design and that I had to go call GrubHub myself to go fix the order and that it was unfortunate that he has trouble seeing order quantity because it's in tiny boxes and that they basically didn't pay any attention and that it wasn't his fault they misread the order. Then he hung up on me when I said it was poor business to tell the customer to go fix the problem.   As a sidenote whoever the owner of Pats is maybe you shouldn't hire millennials to manage your business because they can't take any criticism in the end they don't care about your business."}
{"text":"Sicilian and standard pizzas were fairly good.  Spaghetti was alright.  Prices were reasonable.  The small family owned feel is obvious, especially with the assinine signs about not taking the magazines and such.  Hardly any seating inside, so plan on takeout."}
{"text":"I love it. Great crust, not soggy. Great tasting toppings and nice cosy environment to eat in. I haven't tried every pizza out there. But I enjoy the taste every time I get one. That's what counts. So far the best in town that I've found."}
{"text":"Nice fast service, very small not ideal for sit down. Perfect for to go orders. Nice deal 30ish bucks for large two topping and 30 wings. The wings were delicious- perfectly cooked. Got the mild ( date couldn't handle hot ) it was a good savoury flavor. Got pepperoni and mushroom on the large pizza.. That was very yummy my only complain is that I do not think they use fresh mushrooms. They tasted like those canned slimy mushrooms so I will not be getting the mushrooms again.  But it was a good place I would go again."}
{"text":"There's nothing the least bit elegant about Pat's and it wont be your Aunt Pittypat's cup o' tea, but newer restaurants selling antiseptic, faux authenticity look positively silly next to this guy.  It's a gritty, cramped throwback more than a prototype concept you'd see up the street (ie Pei Wei, Sauce, etc).  At Pat's, you open the front door, and might as well be in Coney Island or Bensonhurst.  The claustrophobic walls burst with New York kitsch, old license plates and smartass signs not to be taken too seriously.  ( There used to be a witch at the front counter, but she's apparently been liquidated and the folks now are helpful and pleasant. )We normally take out, but if you do eat in, dont expect to be waited on at a table- order first at the counter and they'll bring it out to you.    Pies are consistently delicious; not wood fired Bianco artisan or anything, just straight out of the oven NY style thin crust by a paesan who knows what he's doin' - not some part-timer reading a Dominos manual. My teenager says this is the best pizza he's ever had. Having grown up in Brooklyn, I'd say it's the genuine article and way better than the chains. Good olive oil and, of course, the dough. Cant tell you why, but it just tastes different than the chains and you'll taste it in a second.    The other day, I walked in with two teenagers and we each got the daily lunch special - two large cheese slices and a soda. It was $9.72. Not $9.72 each.....$9.72 TOTAL!!  The three of us. Now, there's no sides - hell, there's no utensils other than your hands, napkins and chin - but when was the last time you sat down in an establishment with three adult sized appetites and  had a delicious, satisfying lunch for ten bucks?    It aint the Sistine Chapel, but how can you say anything bad about a place like that?"}
