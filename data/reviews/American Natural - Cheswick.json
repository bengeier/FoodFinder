{"text":"American Natural was a wonderful surprise.  They carry a terrific selection of locally made food products as well as many healthful choices.  As a person who avoids the mini-mart type of thing connected to a gas station,  I will go out of my way to get my gas here and then get a fresh salad or sandwich to go.American Natural also carries my favorite Stumptown cold brew in cans as well as the local Zeke's hot coffee.  They also have a good selection of wine and beer.  I can't say enough good things about American Natural!"}
{"text":"Nice stop.  Clean, well organized, well lit C-store with excellent food options, and I bought wine and beer to take home ... while getting gas for my vehicle, and using the very clean restroom!  What a unique concept here in the state of Pennsylvania!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for a gas station. It's not far from Getgo but getting into and out of the lot is much easier and even more convenient if you're heading in this direction.  The lot as well as the store are clean. There are some yummy options for lunch, fresh sandwiches and above par salads. I had a steak salad with blue cheese crumbles with steak that was cooked better than some 4 star restaurants...well worth my $7. The rest of the store has odds and ends, baked goods, pop, chips, etc."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Great ingredients. So fresh, the bread must have just been made. Split the Tuscan Chicken and Little Big Stuff (a Bahn Mi with Korean style pork) with a friend and it was truly a treat. Added on a side of soup. Never expected a mushroom Brie here, but it was also delicious.   Not to mention all the other great options here. Will definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday night to get gas and purchase a few small snacks. When I walked in the store to pay, I almost got hit with a ball of saran wrap (yes, I realize how odd this sounds).  I figured it was a young kid messing around or something and continued shopping.  When I got to the registers, no one was working either one.  I went over to the cafe area to see if someone there could help me and I saw two employees playing a game of dodgeball with, you guessed it, a ball of saran wrap.  They were visibly annoyed that I interrupted their game, and therefore slow and reluctant to help me.  I asked to speak to the manager and to my complete disgust, the young girl playing laughed and said, \"I am the manager.\"  I left my stuff on the counter and walked out."}
{"text":"I would sum it up as a luxury convenience store. Gourmet drinks and snacks. Fantastic beer selection. Local pastries. Food is way higher quality more like panera bread than other convenience stores like Sheetz."}
{"text":"It's really nice to have something a little bit healthier around in terms of gas stations. A nice selection of new things to try if your used to just getting unhealthy snacks. Nice seating area i feel great when I'm there. They even have board games to play while your there with friends or family. Love it"}
