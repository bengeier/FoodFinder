{"text":"Very good breakfast! Great prices for the amount of food you get. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past 2 days and I wish I lived closer! Food and coffee are both delicious, friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Do I chalk this up to bad food, or poor ordering decisions?  Perhaps a little of both???  I went to the Village Coffeehouse and Grille for lunch last week.  It's a small easily overlooked establishment not too far from work and I stumbled upon it via yelp while searching for somewhere new to go.  

At lunch the place wasn't busy.  Kind of a dingy looking institution, very dated.  They seem to serve some \"gourmet\" coffee, but it was a warm day and I wasn't feeling coffee.  Most things on their menu are greasy spoon types of dishes.  They had a couple salads but the descriptions didn't excite me.  I decided on a grilled chicken sandwich, and added their soup de jour, which was Seafood Bisque.  Bad idea.

You know there are certainly things you should never order from certain places.  Sushi from a gas station rings a bell.  But then again why do these places carry/make these offerings to just make them awful.  Soup came out, within minutes.  It seemed very watery for a bisque but the worst part, the only seafood within was imitation crab meat.  Ugh.  I ate several spoonfuls, mostly out of principal, and because I was very hungry, but alas I had to stop rather quickly as my stomach began to rumble a little something awful.   

A much longer wait for my sandwich.  Finally delivered it was on a sliced Italian bread that was slightly stale and cut way too thick for the fillings.  The fillings were a few pieces of chicken, not like a normal chicken sandwich with one large piece of chicken.  No quarter sized pieces, a leaf of lettuce, some onions and a tomato slice.  I tried ripping some of my bread off since one it wasn't good, and two there was way too much.  My efforts were seen with defeat.  The bread crumbled, probably since it was stale to begin with.  Womp womp.  Now my friend on the other hand enjoyed his meal.  A cheese burger and fries.  To me the burger looked overdone, however I am pretty sure they didn't ask for a temp to cook to, and the fries, which actually were initially forgotten didn't look too great either.  I tried one just for the sake of trying it and I wasn't a fan, but hey it wasn't my meal.  

I can't say I would never go back, but I am in no hurry.  The breakfast menu looked good.  Maybe this is where they really shine."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with very friendly employees. There is fresh ground coffee as well as brewed iced or hot tea. They specialize in breakfast items but I have not tried them yet. The fish sandwich is huge and very good for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a lot of potential! Coffee is a great quality and can be made to go or in house. I've only ever eaten breakfast here and after that meal all I can think is that I wanted to go back for lunch and dinner some time soon!!

The atmosphere is definitely more of a sit down restaurant than a cafe like a Panera or Starbucks.. that sort of bummed me out but it's still just as cute of a place! I enjoy seeing older groups of men and women gathering and young families coming to enjoy a meal together. It was just what this community needed and has been looking for ever since the last local cafe closed. Super clean and friendly staff make it a great experience for all.

The reason I'm knocking off a star is because I went to get some menus to pass out to friends and to post here on yelp and they had nothing for me to take away. Not take out menus (they were out) and no business cards. I was shocked that they had nothing and didn't attempt to give me any thing- I mean hey, I was about to do free advertising for them! Someone with a marketing mindset could really lift this place off the ground and make it a destination for the area."}
