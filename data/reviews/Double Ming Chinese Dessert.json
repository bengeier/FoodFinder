{"text":"I only oder two things here:  Mango Sago dessert and black sesame.   I us I'll like take out since it can get busy on the weekend.  Plus they have the hard chinese chairs and tables that makes  mc Donalds seats feel nice and comfortable. 

The other reviews  are  right. Recently I notice a drop in quality in the sago dish.  But most of the time it still taste amazing"}
{"text":"A nice place to grab some dessert after dinner or just anytime really. Moderate amount of variety to choose from. Although it was a nice place, it is not as good as Tracy's Desserts at First Markham Place. Also noted that the customer service here was not great despite the place not being busy whatsoever when I went."}
{"text":"Their hours state they close at 1:30 on Saturday but will not accept customers after midnight - WTF?"}
{"text":"Very traditional dessert place located in Scarborough. It was my first time going there last week and I found their service to be amazing! They didn't have my fav desserts so I ordered the rice balls. They came steaming hot and tasted great. It came with a ginger sweet broth which was a little too ginger-y but it's good for your sinuses i guess haha... Generally busy when I went there (Saturday Night), so we had to sit with other people at the same table. Which I am totally fine with #asians"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST place to get authentic Chinese dessert. I've been here a few times with friends & family but I after every experience I always seem to come back.

I always opt for the Mango Sago same it is made with freshly cut mangoes. Very creamy and always leaves you wanting a second. On other times I have came to Double Ming I have gotten the rice ball with the filling (not sure what they're called) with coconut milk, which is also good! 

All in all, as you may all can tell I really enjoy the dessert at Double Ming. The only reason why they get 4/5 is that after 12Midnight they sometimes run out of Mango. Very sad"}
{"text":"Good staple Chinese desserts. A go to for quick eats and warm sweet soups. A bit cramped, small chairs, don't go in with bags and heavy jackets, you won't have a place to put them. Take out friendly. Good to have them running for so long. A nice traditional dessert in Scarborough."}
{"text":"a good variety of delicious deserts, though the place is a little bit small and the chairs have no cushions."}
{"text":"Girlfriend wanted Asian dessert so we found this place on Yelp. Went in and the atmosphere was cozy. Service was quick and friendly. 

We ordered the rice balls with peanut crush and sago soup with taro and coconut milk. I had never tried this type of dessert before so I was skeptical, but after having a bite, I was more than pleased. 

After trying it, it was not really my favourite type of dessert but my girlfriend enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Agree with everyone that calls this place a Hidden Gem, been coming to this place for a couple years now. It is definitely one of the better traditional Chinese dessert place around Scarborough and Markham. It's one of those places where you will stick with it after giving it a try.

I always order the \"Hot Ginger Milk\" when I visit because its got that kick from the strong ginger taste that keeps my body warm. The Essence Jelly dessert is also really good depending on which fruits you like. I personally like the watermelon the most because its very refreshing paired with the essence jelly and coconut milk. 

If you are looking to try their fresh mango desserts, they only have it from time to time. I guess because it follows the mango season."}
{"text":"I came here on a weeknight with a couple of aunts who were craving Chinese dessert. We ordered the Ginger Milk, Black Sesame Dessert Soup, Daikon radish cake and the water chestnut cake.

First off, the star of all of these was the Ginger Milk - Joyees Y. described it best: it's like very soft tofu with a very strong ginger flavour. It's not too sweet but it warms you up right away with the spiciness of the ginger (if you don't like ginger,  you won't like this dessert).

The Black Sesame Soup was very nice, not overly sweet and very aromatic. The daikon radish cake is a panfried savory snack and it was very nice, with good substance to it. Lots of place skimp on the daikon and other ingredients and load up with corn starch so I was happy to see this wasn't the case here.

The Water Chestnut cake was nice and refreshing. A nice crunch from the water chestnuts, not too sweet and just the right balance of water chestnuts in it.

The prices are very reasonable for their portion sizes and I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Very good desert place, a place to hang out after dinner.  I would recommend this to anybody."}
{"text":"When we go to the east end with family this is always our to go to place for some hot Chinese dessert a family favorite is the ginger milk which is surprisingly really gingery and made with milk.  There's an extensive menu of different desserts and Its really comforting come the winter months 
something I've discovered this restaurant makes as well as their steamed milk and egg which is a bit like an egg white custard without the yolk, and is really light,  you can opt to put in more add ons
The more seasonal items with mangoes are delicious but sometimes we come and are told they run out of stock quite often. 

Each table comes equipped with a bell system that will call an attendant for various things like water the bill Morty ordering and other general questions so this is perfect for introverts or for people who are  bad at  flagging down someone (that's me!)"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Chinese dessert and there are many choices to choose from. Service is decent, the environment is authentic as well. There is nothing bad to say about this place. My favourite is the black sticky rice with coconut milk, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I think it speaks volumes that this restaurant is almost always packed with people. The variety and quality of the traditional desserts are on-point. Although we have dined in the establishment before my friends and I opted to order take-out, notably the sago and tea eggs. The desserts themselves are nothing extraordinary or out of this world, but they stick to the roots and as with most things, classics are golden. 

The seating arrangement of the restaurant is rather cramped with not much space for you to put anything anywhere. As such, I highly recommend you bring mainly your valuables unless you don't mind putting your belongings on the floor.

As for their service, there can be language barriers as some staff only communicate in Mandarin. However, their menus are available in English so it's definitely possible to get by with only gestures. Don't expect stellar service or staff to consistently check up on you, as they will be too busy with other things such as keeping the turn-over rate at a steady rate. They will not be afraid to be blunt with you to get your order going. 

Overall if you're looking for affordable Chinese desserts in the Scarborough area that's accessible via the TTC, this might be a viable option for you to explore!"}
{"text":"This place comes close to my favorite place for dessert! The only downside is the wait time to be seated and the annoying \"Ding-Dong\" noise that will consistently ring whenever there's someone at the front door.

My favorite items to order are the coconut taro sago - it's an amazing refresher on a hot summer's day! On the other hand, Toronto's ice-cold winter leaves me craving for their piping hot Black sesame or walnut paste - it'll leave you feeling warm and fuzzy after.

The menu is on a piece of paper, which you can conveniently mark down your order. The food comes out fast and you can expect to be ignored by the servers at times because of how busy they are. A few times, we were seated at the same table with another party of two people. Double Ming needs to knock down the wall to the store next door to seat all their customers! 

Everything is also very inexpensive! Needless to say, I'll always drop by when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This location has been here for a long time and serves up traditional hot chinese desserts. Looking at the menu, lots of items look appetizing.

Tried the steamed double layer milk pudding and the herbal essence jelly. Orders came very quickly, I remember when I was here before, there was a slight wait on the ginger milk pudding. Both desserts were vert hot, perfect for a drizzly day. The milk pudding is not overly sweet but didn't see the double skin. The herbal essence jelly seems healthy as it tastes of traditional medicinal herbs. You can balance out the bitterness with some syrup. 

Thought they had soy tofu pudding but they didn't have any.

Not busy on a Sunday afternoon, but it does get busy at night."}
{"text":"Absolute terrible customer service! There was a young gentlemen that had awesome customer service when I noticed that the ginger milk dessert I ordered was not up to standard and the viscosity of the dessert was extremely low which gave it a terrible experience. I then requested the young waiter to switch it or offer us to change the dessert to something else or cancel it. I accepted the offer and some fat Guang Zhou China man came out (guessing its the owner) came out and provided a reasoning that the milk we use in Toronto is like that. We been in the business for 3 generations and its always like this. He took the dessert back and did not offer me a cancelation or an offer to switch to a different dessert. Under the assumption, I guessed he cancelled it because I did not receive an alternative dish.

I then asked for the bill, they charged me for the dessert that was subpar and I did not consume it. I refused to pay for something I didnt eat as the young gentlemen said they are willing to cancel it.

At that point, they argued that I consumed it and decided that I have to pay with it and there was a huge confrontation in front of the whole restaurant. They threatened to call the cops on me because I refused to pay; however, I was willing to pay for the dishes I consumed except for the ginger milk. 

Despite the confrontation, the china owner had terrible attitude in how he treated this situation until another young gentlemen said just come pay for what you eat and dont worry about it. 

This young Guang Zhou man not only had a terrible attitude, but embarrassed himself in front of all his customers by confronting me by causing a huge commotion."}
{"text":"After being here a few times and trying a few of the items on the menu, I've come to the conclusion that this place is hit or miss.

Black Sticky Rice with Coconut Juice? This is the winner for me. Served hot as a purple soup, this dessert is made fragrant by a drizzle of coconut milk and given texture by the slight chewiness of the sticky rice. Although not having tried myself, there is a jello variant available as well (grass jelly, I believe).

Tea Eggs? The egg that I got was WAY on the overcooked side. I understand that tea eggs need to be submerged in a hot liquid for a prolonged period, but what I received was a tea egg with a yolk that was entirely green/grey with a rubberized white to boot. In terms of flavour, saltiness dominated the palette, with a minimal amount of spice present. I likely wouldn't get this again.

Sweet almond paste? Not overly sweet with a gentle almond flavour. In itself, it is pleasant and appealing, however, it is quick to thicken to a goopiness that deters from the experience. I probably would not order this again either.

Curried fish balls? Ten per order, with a thick, overly salty curry sauce. Get yourself some extra tea if you decide to get this, or forego this all together."}
{"text":"Delicious Cantonese dessert! They use fine materials. Love the black sesame and mango dessert!"}
{"text":"Love this place for it's hot boiled papaya coconut juice with white fungus and their rice balls with peanut sprinkles. I've tried other places and still this place makes it the best! 

It's a small place with only about nine tables in total. There's always a wait whenever I come here but it isn't long as the turnover is quick. Splitting a table with strangers is always an option if you want to be seated quicker. 

Service is quick and they accept cash only."}
{"text":"Dessert after dinner. Place was here for many years. I used to really like their steam eggs or egg custard. But this time was very disappointed. It doesn't taste good. Egg custard was watery. My Chinese herbed with egg dessert was plain, dull like no sugar. Egg was hard and plasticky. The coconut purple rice dessert doesn't have enough coconut milk. Meh. 

Too many competitions out there. Don't need to come here since it isnt spectacularly impressing."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some sweets after having dinner. Nice decor and authentic Chinese desserts. Only problem is there is very limited seating so avoid this place if your with a big group."}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants in scarborough for traditional chinese dessert. It's kind of pricey for a small bowl ($5-6). They have a lot of the traditional chinese desserts and they can customize it for you sometimes if you ask. They also have traditional chinese street foods. The black sesame dessert is my favourite and even though it tastes really good, the consistency of it is really thin making it kind of seemed watered down. Other than that, the other desserts are pretty traditional and if I need a fix for late night traditional chinese dessert, I would definitely come here."}
{"text":"This is a little restaurant in the Finch and Midland plaza for Chinese dessert. I've always been a fan of this place because make one of the best steamed egg whites, sweet soups, and sago soups.

You can almost always find parking in that plaza as they have an abundant amount of parking spaces. The restaurant is always packed yet the waiting line is pretty quick - they serve fast and people eat fast :)

Few of my favourite orders include the \"Black Sticky Rice & Steamed Egg White with Milk\" as well as their \"Sago Soup with Milk & Coconut Juice\". Nevertheless, be aware that their menu items are very similar, just mixed with various toppings and ways of boiling. If you ever go there, get their steamed egg whites! They are sooooo smooth to the mouth. It breaks automatically when shaken. That's what a good steamed egg white dessert should be like too!

Side note, Double Ming service has always been super efficient and the people are not bad. They serve almost under ten minutes for everything you ordered, and always hands you the bill right away when you ask."}
{"text":"I forgot how good this little dessert place is, I better start remembering now so I don't miss this whenever I am in the neighbourhood.

I'll definitely order the steamed milk pudding (mix with your favourite dessert toppings)! They are so silky and smooth, I tried to remake it at home but it was impossible to make it as smooth!"}
{"text":"Here's a tip, read the tips before you order!  We wanted the mango grass jelly but didn't see it on the menu so ordered the seasonal fruit on grass jelly instead.  It was a bit disappointing.  The fruits weren't that sweet.  It was literally fruit on top of grass jelly.  I was expecting some sort of liquid with it to make it a bit more sweet.  One of the yelp pictures have it with what looks like some evaporated milk?  Ours didn't come with any.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong one.  I wish I read the tip that said some items aren't on the menu but posted on the wall like the mango grass jelly.  Wonder if they were in English though since I couldn't even read my name if it was written in Chinese on the wall.  

We also ordered the hot coconut, taro, sago soup with the rice balls.  The soup was good but I was disappointed the rice balls didn't have anything in them like black sesame.  But again, probably my fault for not ordering the right thing.  I probably could have asked to have the sweet rice balls with black sesame but didn't know how to communicate it.  My Chinglish is pretty bad.  

Will probably have to review Double Ming again when I order the right stuff next time."}
{"text":"When bubble tea ain't doing it. This place hits the spot. That's all I have to say #hangrymann"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their desserts are awesome and their snacks are even better. If you go here make sure you order the fried turnip patties. I've eaten a lot and they are the absolute best here! Here is a must-go!"}
{"text":"Feels like a dessert joint straight out of Hong Kong. We ordered ginger jong lai (I think they called it boiled milk dessert), walnut paste soup, and fresh mango over sago. The ginger was strong! Just how I like it :D The mango was incredibly fresh and fragrant. The walnut paste was smooth and tasted freshly made, but the flavor was a little lacking."}
{"text":"The desserts are okay but the server working there needs a training again. (This was from a while ago when I went there). He needs to make a BIT more eye contacts when he's talking to customers to show a bit respect."}
{"text":"Came here a year ago, and then came here again yesterday and it looked just like it did a year back. Same decor; same round tables with stools tucked underneath. You're basically transported into a chinese teahouse once you step through the door.

I enjoy the seats. They're not chairs, so you won't be able to lean back or anything, but once in a while it's not bad to sit on a stool.

In the back, there is a coat rack, along with a corridor leading to a lone washroom.
Staff can speak english, so if you're not confident with your chinese that is not a problem.

When you are seated, tea will be served to your table, along with an ordering sheet.

They have a variety of desserts to choose from. Ordering is done through the sheet. They also have some seasonal desserts that are listed on the counter, so pay attention to those as well as those aren't on the menu! (it was full of mango options that day)

I ordered a red bean paste with steamed egg and milk. It was sweet, but not too sweet. Has that nice red bean flavour. The steamed egg and milk work pretty well with it. Although at $5.99... I don't know probably should've gotten something that wasn't so common. The mango desserts that everyone else got came with so much mango that I probably should've gone with that as well.

One thing I noticed was the hasma menu has changed significantly.
They used to offer a variety of stewed hasma options for $5.99, but they took most of those options out now it's a mix of hasma and swallow's nest, which increases the price significantly. So if you're looking for hasma...might have to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here because of the yelp reviews and after one visit, I'm a fan.  Looking forward to future visits and trying different desserts.  Well done Yelp!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Double Ming in a long time. The last time I went, I think I had the walnut paste. I ordered sago, taro in coconut milk and I forgot to ask for less sweetness. I can definitely see myself coming back to try the other items that other yelpers have recommended. I give it 3.5* for the dessert and 0.5* for the tieguanyin tea - which would be perfect if it was a little hotter. A good spot for after work dessert with the colleagues or late night after a night out!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  Dessert is fine however service was absolutely terrible. After waiting more than 20 mins, the waitress brought us the wrong dessert.  They did admit their mistake and told us to keep the incorrect order. However they failed to bring us the correct order and still charged us for the incorrect order. After bringing it to their attention,  instead of apologizing, they decided to give us a measly 10% off. Terrible customer service, horrible ethical principles."}
{"text":"Ordered almond paste soup, boiled ginger milk and the tong yun. The almond paste were a bit bland for my liking but the tong yun with the black sesame fillings were really good. Quite chewy with a nice crunch from the peanuts. Would come back here but will try to order something else."}
{"text":"I had the boiled milk and ginger, mango sago (its not on the menu but posted on the wall), and black sesame paste.
all good except the black sesame paste which was a big disappointment - too watery, could see the starch bits and didn't have a strong black sesame flavor. mango sago has coconut milk in it.
would come back for the boiled milk and ginger since I dont know many places that serve it."}
{"text":"Came here with Boyfriend the other night after having dined at Akina at Kennedy and Denison for a sugar fix.  Boyfriend was craving Sweet Red Bean Soup, which is not something you typically find at an AYCE sushi restaurant.

So it gave me the excuse to introduce him to Double Ming Chinese Dessert and I think he is in love... with Double Ming that is!

When we arrived shortly around 8:30PM, the place was packed and we ended up sharing a table with another party.  

The decor of the restaurant reminds you of an \"herbal tea shop\" found in Hong Kong.  It gives the restaurant an authentic Chinese feel.

I opted for the Hasma & Papaya with Steamed Milk and Boyfriend ended up opting for the Coconut Red Bean and Glutinous Black Rice Dessert after I pointed it out on the menu.  

The Hasma & Papaya with Steamed Milk was delicious.  Most menu offerings are available hot or cold, but I opted for hot.  I was not disappointed with my choice.  Hasma tastes like mini gelatinous jello strands (similar in texture to mini tapioca) and is made from dried fallopian tubes of true frogs?  I am sure that real hasma is not used at Double Ming as they would surely be charging more than $6 for the authentic thing.  I'm kind of glad they don't use the real thing... 

Boyfriend was perfectly content with his Cold Coconut Red Bean & Glutinous Black Rice Dessert.  It was a \"heavier\" dessert than what I ordered, but I liked the texture of the Glutinous Black Rice and the dessert was not overly sweet.

It should be noted that Chinese desserts are generally less sweet than its western counterparts.  I think that Chinese taste buds are more biased towards savoury than sugary.

For $9, we both left with satisfied tummies.  I too am in love... with Double Ming that is ;)"}
{"text":"Double Ming won't have the same quality and variety of Chinese desserts as notable dessert companies back in China, but it's definitely my trusted go to hub when I'm craving desserts that aren't the usual bubble teas, cakes, ice cream waffles and etc. This is the best vendor for Chinese desserts that I've found so far in the GTA.  The historical decor can be a hit or miss for some, but I find it to be generally pleasant. It has a steady pool of clients and it is located in a small plaza, so seating is limited.  Expect to wait at least 5 minutes or more depending on the size of your group.  Also, the price to portion size ratio is reasonable compared to many of its competitors.  I recommend getting the mango dishes like mango sago and mango on steamed egg with milk; these are limited time items in the summer by the way! There isn't really an item on the menu that I don't like, why don't you give it all a try?"}
{"text":"Blown away! I really enjoyed coming here. I was thinking this was just another Sweet Culture, but I guess I was wrong. Yes, the food and selection was very much like Sweet Culture, but the quality was miles ahead.

I ordered the cold coconut grass jelly dessert and fiancé had the cold taro coconut with sago dessert. We were both very impressed with the flavour and freshness of it. I'm not a dessert kind of guy - still I thought it was uber good, so that says a lot. We also ordered a tea leaf egg and even that was awesome. The taste was.. So good. So delicious..

I highly recommend this place, during quiet hours. The reason it's not 5 stars is because the place was just so damn small. The issue could have been easily remedied by putting small tables in the middle but they kept it open. I understand they kept it open to avoid obstruction, but I thought the walkway was good to fit a few small tables for two people.

Even so, the quality is second to none. All Yelpers must try this place!"}
{"text":"Arguably the BEST Chinese dessert place In town! The boiled milk with ginger is a must have in this store. I really likes their double layered milk pudding with red bean as well."}
{"text":"I thought it was one of the better places for Chinese dessert. The mango sago came with SO much mangos, it was good but not the best tasting. I got the coconut milk with purple rice and jelly and thought it was pretty good and refreshing. They also gave out tea which is nice. If I'm in the area, I would return."}
{"text":"Headed here with some yelpers after a \"fear factor\" UYE. I knew my adventurous eating had not come to an end when Jen K. insisted on ordering for me (with a sinister smile). We yelpers got a few things to share and while usually I am not a fan of Chinese desserts I quite liked this place. 

Jen K. insisted I must order the hasma (and she told me I could not look up what it was until I tried it, again with a sinister smile), I opted for the walnut flavour. This dish was actually quite delicious. It's kind of like a thin walnut putting with some mysterious jelly floating around (the dreaded hasma, which btw is made from the fallopian tubes of frogs, consumed of course for its supposed health benefits, if you don't believe me look it up!). Other than the off-putting secret ingredient the pudding itself had a nice creamy texture and intense walnut flavour, quite yummy. 

We also got 2 orders of glutinous rice balls (one plain and one with black sesame), I am becoming a fan of this dish. These rice balls were quite large, very chewy and garnished with peanuts for a nice little crunch, A-OK. Next up was turtle jelly (made with turtle essences, again for the alleged health benefits), served with fruits this dish was not my cup of tea. The jelly was very bitter and not even the sweetness of the fruit was enough to balance it out, take a pass on this one. 

The place itself was intimate and would be a nice place to hang out with some friends after a meal. It was buzzing and quite busy on a Saturday night with a line-up quickly forming. I was the only non-Asian person so I knew this was as authentic as it gets. I had no interaction with the waitresses but rather let the Chinese speaking yelpers take care of the ordering. Overall a good place for some \"healthy\" and not so sweet, but slightly frightening Chinese desserts."}
{"text":"This is a Classic old School Desert place in Scarborough, that is has been around for over 20 years. Although i've been to this place many times, this will be the first time that i'm there to try these particular items. Usually i go there to get their signature Steam Milk Egg white desert. Which they do a great job at. it it what they are famous for. However this time around i wanted to try their other deserts and food/snacks to see how they are as an all around place. 

So we went and try a few items, the first is a curry fish ball, which i say it pretty standard, the snack was okay, it was what you expect although the curry wasn't really that great, the fish ball was nice. Then the soy sauce chicken wings, this one was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst i ever had, it was overcooked, and the taste was really diluted so by no means if you value your taste buds should you order the soy sauce chicken wings. 
 
the next item is the crushed peanut rice ball, which is actually pretty good, very traditional flavour. the boiled egg desert with lotus seed, that one was nice it is not strong in flavour which is what its supposed to be but on a cold day definetely a great desert to warm you up. 

and finally the last desert was the coconut juice with assorted fruit and herbal jelly. it is a decent desert, the fruist were pretty good, and with the mixer that has a slightly bitter herbal jelly(its supposed to be bitter) is pretty refreshing.

This is definetely the place to go, if you want traditional chinese desert that is low in fat, low in sugar, but refreshing and good for you. eating chinese deserts has always been about the subtle flavour and enjoying the simple fresh ingredients. This place does a good job of it, and also doesn't cost a fortune. 

The service at the place was like most chinese places, it is very efficient and no nonsense."}
{"text":"3 stars is probably a little generous. I tried the black sesame soup and it was just okay. Pretty diluted in my books, not thick, pretty watered down, and not much strong black sesame taste. I have had better elsewhere. I also tried the ginger steamed milk which was decent, good flavor but not my first choice. Oddly enough they get enough volume in the late evening. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff or I'm a bit more selective in my desserts. Prices seemed a bit steep for what you get in my opinion."}
{"text":"Double ming, you make my taste buds sing.

What we got:
Steamed egg white with milk - If you dreamt of eating a tofu hua (tofu pudding) but with actual flavour and cream and goodness, you'll love this. 
Red bean rice ball in ginger soup - New favourite destination for rice ball desserts. As soon as you bite into it, you will be able to tell that it was homemade and not from a freezer in T&T.

Bonus Fun fact: Hasma, a popular ingredient on the menu, is the fat tissue found near the Fallopian tubes of a frog. Not \"just uhh...frog fat\" that the waitress will so elegantly describe. Coming back to try this on a day I'm feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Turtle Jelly!  That's the name of the dessert I have here either HOT or COLD.  I'm not sure if the bitterness of the Medicinal ingredients actual help me improve my health but at least it keeps me away from over-sweeten cakes that I will get Diabetes from some day.

This is ONE of the few places for Chinese Dessert in this Scarborough Neighbourhood until you go North around Steeles.  It's also one of the places that open later at night if you find yourself with nothing to do and do not wish to go to PUB or BAR.

They have around 6 Traditional Asian Round Tables (T.A.R.T) and the Decor to match.  They use to have a MOUNTAIN of styrofoam cups to block off their counters but now it is just wooden separators.

Check off your items on the order list and depending on what you ordered it will arrive shortly.  Some items might need additional time to Boil & Steam like some of the Milk items.

If you ever get BORED chatting with friends, just turn and watch some FAIRCHILD TV(Cantonese).  You'll have to know how to READ the Chinese subtitles because they turn the sound off."}
{"text":"Got take out and wait time was about 5mins. Good quality Chinese desserts where they add a fair amount of ingredients inside and it's not watery like the cheap ones. Will be coming back again another time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good just that when I was there, a lot of the deserts weren't available and I didn't know why. The services weren't the best but It was acceptable. I would probably go back with some friends only if more deserts are available."}
{"text":"Was craving chinese desserts, because I didn't know any I found this place via Yelp. It was a bit hard to locate due to the area having a lot of chinese restaurants in different plazas. We were seated promptly and ordered rice balls with crushed peanuts (OK) and my childhood favourite Taro Coconut Sago (Yum). BF wasn't a huge fan because there was not a lot of desserts that he liked on the menu.
Overall, I would like to come back and try their other desserts. Good place to hang out and grab quick chinese dessert."}
{"text":"I suggest checking your order before leaving, I made that mistake and ordered take out even paid for extra toppings, I drove 20 min back home and ended up with the wrong dessert. . . Thanks a lot, low chance I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was a cool post dinner treat.... had ZERO clue what to get so I had someone else order for me after a couple questions. It was a ginger broth.... not too strong with uhhh... like doughy balls that had a yummy peanut centre in them. Good surprise for sure!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d?"}
{"text":"As soon as I enter there is a neat & authentic feel to this dessert shop, 6 squat stools assigned to each round table, a nice touch.

I got 2 items, Coconut Red Bean & Glutinous Black Rice Dessert .

The Cold Coconut Red Bean & Glutinous Black Rice Dessert were heavy deserts with porridge like texture & not overtly sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed both desserts.

If peckish & feeling like some very tasty & not too lardy sweets then you should visit Double Ming Chinese Dessert."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most traditional Chinese dessert restaurant in Scarborough. The interior is also pretty nice and gives off a traditional Chinese feel with the décor. I particularly liked the stone stools, so unique! 

I wanted to order the mango sago but I didn't see it in the menu (or I'm just really blind) so I just ordered taro sago and steamed milk egg pudding. Super delicious! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite dessert places in GTA. Love their coconut milk sago - it is delicious whether served cold or hot! During weekends it gets pretty packed as they are quite small."}
{"text":"I've been looking all over the place for the Chinese steamed milk dessert, and When I finally found it here, it was perfect. Service is good, the place is authentic, and very busy! I will definitely be going back time and again even though it is a bit farther from where I live."}
{"text":"I like double Ming mainly for its location. It's close to many other Chinese restaurants so it's great to drop by here after dinner whenever I feel like getting Chinese desserts. 

It's a popular dessert shop and it gets quite busy so there could be a wait sometimes. But most customers don't stay long here since it's not really an environment to stay for long, so the wait isn't long. 

The service is fast and efficient. At other dessert shops when I get the steamed egg dessert, it seems to take long to make. But double ming is efficient and they are able to prepare freshly made desserts quickly. 

I like the steamed egg dessert when is my go-to item at a Chinese dessert place. I've had the grass jelly desserts here which is also great. However, sometimes there isn't much grass jelly in the dessert bowl. I would get a bowl with 20% jelly and 80% fruits... which makes me think maybe they are low on the jelly and they are trying to serve the dessert with fruits. So if they could improve on the ratio of the jelly and fruits then that would be great. 

In general, this is a solid spot if you want Chinese desserts."}
{"text":"Came here at midnight last Saturday (they close at 1am) and there were maybe 6 customers at the time. Iwas with my bf and we ordered a walnut paste soup with peanut filled glutinous rice balls, a chicken ginseng soup, and another glutinous rice dessert. The food wasn't bad, but cost $21 and we were pretty much rushed out the door. When we got our food it might have been 12:20 and at 12:40 they gave us the bill and said they were closing. I've worked in the service industry before and you don't ask customers who are still eating to leave your establishment 20min before closing time. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"2.5-3

This is your typical Chinese dessert place but nothing really stood out, except the boiled papaya with white fungus. I was surprised that they used coconut juice/milk instead of the normal sugar cane syrup but what really caught my attention was how many papaya was in that small bowl! I honestly thought there wouldn't be that many...boy was I wrong.

Everything else; tong yun with peanut/ginger and black sesame paste was so-so. I wouldn't come out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall close to our hotel, we decided to come for a snack mid afternoon. We were a little hungry since we had early dim sum and skipped lunch. This was the perfect little snack that tied us over til dinner at 8pm. 

We walked in and they weren't particularly busy prob because it was mid afternoon Sunday. We had some \"tong shui\" which is a Chinese dessert soup. 

We ordered three desserts. 

-Ginger Boiled Milk
The snappiness of the ginger and smoothness of the milk was a great combination. The milk was not sweet which some places tend to do. It had a slight sweetness but very faint allowing the snappiness of the ginger to really stand out. Loved it!

-Mango (Gwai Leen Go) Herbal Essence
The herbal essence is usually herby and slightly bitter but this didn't taste much like herbal essence more like plain grass jelly. IMHO not worth it especially if they are charging more for this. But the mango was good and it was a good desert nevertheless. 

-Green Bean Steamed Egg White With Milk 
This was niiiiiiice! The green bean was on top of the steamed egg white with milk and when mixed together it was a nice subtle flavor. Felt very soothing. Not sweet but the green bean gave it a natural sweetness to it. 

Service 
Typical Chinese restaurant service which is nothing to write home about. Their attitude is give em just enough to get by. Not friendly not eager to please. 
Oh well..at least the dessert was on point."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here.  They have no more mango desserts anymore.  They don't sell them at all.  Their Taro sago is hard and taste watery.  The waiter is rude and you have to share tables or else you have to wait.  They only have a few tables and you have to watch otherwise they just jump the number and give to other people.  
Do NOT order their cold desserts.  They taste awful.  Their hot desserts are better.  There are a lot of desserts around the area.  Just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese dessert place in GTA at an affordable price. I only discovered it this year!

They have the traditional desserts like walnut paste, sagos, and a lot of turtle jelly desserts. I guess most famous for their ginger boiled milk, which is recommended by many people. The milk is silky smooth but I find the ginger taste a bit too strong.

My favorite is the Boiled Milk Papaya - warm, smooth milky milk with subtle papaya taste; soft and sweet papaya cubes and bits of 'snow ear'. 

I also like the Mixed Fruit \"Turtle Jelly\" in Coconut Milk. 

Now my go-to Chinese dessert place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favourite is the steamed ginger milk pudding, especially during a cold winter. It helps to warm you up and keep you cozy. There's usually a wait for a table, but the desserts are definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"descent tasting restaurant but find price range is higher than average stores and food are too small....also open too late ( open at 3pm in the afternoon)"}
{"text":"My go to place for traditional Asian desserts, especially when the weather turns colder and icecream or cold BBT isn't what you want. I always order the hot ginger milk pudding because the ginger is kick-in-the-mouth strong but still silky smooth. Had the herbal jelly this time, which had that authentic bitter taste without being overpowering. The peanut glutinous rice balls in ginger soup was a hit with the table. The place is usually packed at night, but the service is fast so it moves quickly - especially if you are willing to share a larger table. The short wooden stools are a little rickety, so be careful with them."}
{"text":"3.5-4/5

Desserts were pretty good, but definitely varies on what you get. The ginger soup with the dumpling balls were really great and the ginger soup was very strong. On the other hand, their sweet walnut soup tasted watered down and their cold coconut sago, while tasty and sweet, wasn't cold at all. All in all still a good place to visit if you're craving Chinese dessert!"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional  Chinese desserts! I always get the steamed milk pudding with red bean. It's very smooth and not sweet. I find the other options to be hit or miss so I am comfortable sticking to my usual order.  It's a popular spot and is usually always busy... even when you decide to drop by at night time (they close at some ungodly hour like 1am for those late night cravings)."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is that it's cash only.  I had no idea, and I tend to not carry any cash with me so I had to go to the atm in the convenience store a few stores down.  Please put a 'cash only' sign, maybe it was in chinese but I can't read that shit LOL 

We had the fresh mango w steamed egg white and mlk ($6.50) and fresh mango w tapioca ($6).  Decent prices, but I wish the portions were bigger"}
{"text":"Man is this place the perfect place to go on a cold winter day. Tried the sago soup with taro and coconut juice and also the sweet sesame rice balls with milk soup. Both were very tasty. Not too sweet and not overly sweet as well. Just perfect. The rice balls were nice and chewy and one bowl comes with 6 rice balls for $4.75.  I mean, sure you can go to a Chinese grocery store and pickup the powdered flavor soup and get some frozen rice balls and just heat it up at home but with the variety of flavors there are to choose from its better to just come here and try 2-3 different flavors at once. 

The place is fairly small and opens late at 3pm. Seating inside is only meant for large groups as all their tables are the round circular type which seats about 8 people so it is common to be seated with complete strangers but I'm cool with that. And the seats are not really chairs but stools so its not really a place to bring your granny for some sweet Asian soup dessert.

Just a note: I have a soft spot for turtles as I have had one for a pet for close to 30 years so stay away from the soup which use turtles :)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese desserts. Relatively cheap prices compared to other Chinese dessert places in the area. Their boiled milk always made smooth. What I like the most is the almond paste because it's not made from instant powder/package. I usually order out since it can be really busy even on a week night."}
{"text":"I ordered the special ginger milk dessert. Apparently it's well made there and I saw on their wall they won some award for it. I was fooled. I took a bite out of it, o.m.g it was the worst tasting one I've had. It's basically ginger water. It was so watery and no egg taste. The ginger flavour was so strong it made my throat hot. I almost spat it out. Luckily my friend switched with me and he had the purple sticky rice dessert soup. I e frequent this place before and normally it's not too bad. But I'll never over that ginger thing ever again. Also their seating is the most uncomfortable seating."}
{"text":"Always love their steam egg pudding. Their other desserts are great too! Service is minimal, but I like it that way. Go there to chat with friends anyways."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill, ordered the sago with taro and it was pretty nasty, the taro tasted very old, kind of chalky like flavor and the sago was like clumped together....never coming back again"}
{"text":"Fair priced comfort food, with delicious desserts, a must try if you are in the area. Unfortunately they aren't open until the evening, but if you're looking for some traditional Chinese desserts, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Nomnomnom chinese sweet soup. Traditional and modern desserts. Nothing fancy but if you want something late at night it hits the spot"}
{"text":"I had the red bean steamed milk and coconut red bean jelly. Both are creamy but a little bit too sweet. 
This place is always packed and they only have few tables. 

Note: They only accept cash!"}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese dessert in Scarborough, you can find most representative of Chinese dessert there.
Traditional Chinese environment, wood chair and tables, blue china. But it is a small place.
Price is quite good( dessert on menu), expensive for seasonal dessert (such as Mango series for this season, all around $7.25).
Definitely good taste!!!
Sums up, I give four star.
One star missing because of narrow space?lack of variety and high price for seasonal dessert."}
{"text":"By far, the BEST Chinese dessert house in town.

I've been going back to Double Ming for many years (I do take-outs quite often). Service has always been quick and courteous, and the dessert quality has always been great and very consistent :) I believe it is a family run dessert house... because sometimes I walk in on them during their dinner lol. They have a rice cooker out on the table XD

Two of my highly recommended items ;)

1. Fresh Mango Sago dessert - One of the most popular items to order during the summer! Super refreshing, and they give you chunks and chunks of fresh, sweet, and very in season mangoes!!

2. Boiled Milk with Ginger dessert - Excellent dessert to have during the winter. This is very similar to tofu, but MUCH more delicate, silky and smooth :D The ginger taste is very strong/spicy... makes your body feel warm and fuzzy after hehehe... 

If you're in the area, visit Double Ming for some authentic Chinese desserts! If you are adventurous, go for something you've never heard of hahaha... they have so much to offer at this local gem located at the Finch/Midland Plaza. Be sure NOT to come on a Monday - closed, unless they specify :P"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I ordered the sago with assorted fruits and it had absolutely no flavor. The fruits were not sweet, sago was bland with no juice or anything to make it sweet. $4.50

My friend had the taro coconut milk sago $4.50 which she enjoyed. I mean if you like all of those things then it should be good. 

Guess I'm just not that into traditional Chinese desserts. At least I kinda of... Tried it. 

The staff was nice so I'm giving it 3."}
{"text":"Dined here during a full restaurant though barely any wait. Ordered the mango sago and the red bean with coconut milk.

Tons of menu options make ordering complicated, best to stick with the fan favourites. Mango sago had good explosive mango flavour. Not a surprise, exactly what you'd imagine it to taste. The red bean coconut was nothing special. Mix soft red bean and add coconut milk at home and viola.

Not a place for exceptional service, just expect to be seated (read: seat yourself), order, dine, pay, leave. All with little or no interaction from waiting staff.

From my experience, Double Ming is somewhere I would only visit if I had a serious craving for mango but next time around I see myself ordering the rice balls with peanuts. Would definitely give the menu another chance."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located in the plaza with Tim Hortons and a bunch of other restaurants at Midland and Finch. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Quick & efficient. Just note your order on the order sheet & desserts arrive pretty quickly. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Authentic Chinese dessert restaurant vibes with antique-style round tables and stools. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
Authentic & comforting. This is as good as it gets to the real deal for Chinese desserts. 

[ORDER]
Boiled Ginger Milk - $4.99 - so soft, delicate, and soul-warming. Perfect amount of spice from the ginger, balanced with sweetness of the milk. 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
I would definitely recommend this place for a post-dinner treat. I think their Boiled Ginger Milk is a must-try, definitely worth the value, and the best in Toronto!

Note: Cash Only"}
{"text":"I'm not a Chinese dessert person usually so this review may be biased but I do feel a pang for it sometimes, which brought me here tonight. 

To start off, they brought hot tea for everyone which was probably appreciated, but I can't have caffeine before I sleep so I asked for water. The table is large enough for a group of 5 friends but the stools that we sat on were super uncomfortable. It was small (and I'm pretty small already) and awfully hard - probably because of its material. I ordered savoury and sweet and didn't appreciate that the savoury came after my sweets. I had the following:

1. Turnip Cake ($5.50): I think there were about 8 pieces of palm-sized turnip cakes, which, for the price, isn't bad at all. Unfortunately, it was way too oily and it was way too salty. It came with a side of sriracha sauce but I can't have anything spicy so I just had it plain, but I could only take so much oil...

2. Hot Almond Paste Soup ($4.99): if you've ever had sweetened almond milk, the taste is pretty much that - except the texture, which is slightly thicker (think cream soup). Since I usually drink my almond milk unsweetened, this was too sweet for my tastebuds. However, I did like that it was the right warm temperature to try right away. 

3. Hot Boiled Milk and Ginger ($4.99): I've had steamed milk with egg white and ginger before so I thought they were essentially the same. Texture-wise, the boiled milk without egg is not as firm as the usual dish I get. First taste - GINGER OVERLOAD! I get that it says there is ginger in my dish but it was way more than necessary. If you've been paying attention in this post, you know I can't have spicy. This left a burning sensation in my throat - it was that spicy! I had to give it away because I couldn't even take the next taste.

I came with my group of friends so we had ordered quite a bit so I didn't like that the servers didn't say what anything was when they put it down on the table. We had to clarify a few times. The service overall was inattentive. No water refills and no tea refills unless asked for. All in all, not a fan and won't come again."}
{"text":"Double Ming, I like your name.  My wife loves your Gua Ling Go.  My double milk custard was ok, nothing exceptional.  My younger bro loves your Walnut paste, rich and consistent, very well flavored.  If I had more time, I would revisit and try something else to see what I might have missed.  My 4 Stars is based on my wife/brother's opinion of what they ordered."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for a traditional Chinese dessert spot in the midst of Scarborough. Upon walking in, you'll have this feel of ancient China where the seatings are just a stool made of wood with a center piece made of marble. 

The menu is a plain piece of paper and nothing special to it where you place your order directly on the paper. Unfortunately this place ran out of the best selling items including the steam egg with milk and everything else in that category and one of their drinks, but I don't blame them for it since I went at 12:30am.

The out of the ordinary items ordered tonight included the essence jelly with fresh fruit and coconut milk. This was my first time trying the essence jelly and it is bitter than I expected, but it balances well with the sweetness from the fruit and coconut milk. The second item was this warm hasma which was very sweet, but tasty nonetheless. The use of natural nuts with the hasma (jelly-like) was a good way to end off the night before passing out. 

It doesn't get the full 5 stars because the server had a hard time communicating in English and for 2 desserts for $20, it is steeper than my usual desserts I would normally order. 

Overall, really nice place feeling like China."}
{"text":"After my solo visit at Double Ming Chinese Dessert, I have the honour to accompanied a few other yelpers for 2 separate occasions and able to try more of their dessert offerings! And I have to say I am more and more impressed!

Janelle W was almost tricked in thinking hasma is a fungus... when I wiped out my phone and googled that and now at least she knows what she is getting herself in and she could not resist in trying that! 

When you can eat frog genitalia, grounded turtle shell in essence Jelly just like a walk in a park... 

I always trying to explain to my fellow companions the reasons behind why we eating all these Chinese desserts.. how healthy it is.. blah blah blah.. but that always fall into deaf ears, because basically they just ignored me and went \"hmmm, ahhh, so delicious!\""}
{"text":"I really love this place for chinese desserts. Their desserts taste freshly made, unlike other places that seem to just use the powder form.
I especially like the walnut soup dessert. It's so good. It tastes like they just crushed all the walnuts that day. Adding some black sesame tang yuen...omg. heaven!
The sesame soup dessert is good too. Freshly ground sesame. yum!
Black sticky rice dessert with mini plain tang yuan is good too. 
I've also tried their herbal essence jelly. Tastes a lot better than most places. And it's cheaper than most places! 

The only thing I noticed is this place isn't that good if you want mango flavoured desserts, as they don't have it. Their coconut milk tapioca desserts seem to be not as good as other places, such as hung fook tong. I would just stick with the authentic chinese dessert soups instead. 

Service is so so at this place. Sometimes you get a good server, sometimes you get a bad one. Last time, we got a server who gave us an impression that she wanted us to leave before we even sat down. 

This place is small, so they have limited seats. Sometimes you'll have to share a table with strangers."}
