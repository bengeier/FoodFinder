{"text":"Went here for dinner with a few girlfriends. Food was great. Service was awesome. Our server was very attentive, ensuring there was no pork in any of the dishes for my friend. Would go there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday lunch and was met with a friendly hostess and seated right away. The floors were noticeably greasy and slippery as we walked to our table and had probably not been cleaned from the Saturday night service.  The menu is well rounded and I had the pulled pork panini with gouda and lemon aioli. The panini was tiny and the pulled pork was more like chunks of pork... maybe 3 oz in total. My friend had a Greek salad for $19 and it had about 4 oz of chicken on it. Was not the best value. The burger option looked good as well as some of the featured brunch items. Overall the food was good but seemed short on value. Fries served were quite dark and it looked like the frier oil had not been changed in some time.  I did not notice any form of management of floor supervision. The table next to us had multiple complaints about food but I did not see any Quality/ Assurance/Follow up from a manager. Atmosphere was cold and not music was on in the dining area."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to drop by this place since I live quite near the area. When I finally did, it is as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the brisket sandwich, I felt like I died and went to heaven. I sat near the bar and observed the chefs in action, they were very professional and have put so much love and effort into each dish served. Kudos, to all the hard working people in this restaurant, will be coming back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews on yelp. Unfortunately it fell way short. Looks, price and presentation mean nothing if the there is no flavour. Very tough prime rib and rubbery chicken. The veggies were good but $100+ meal (for 2) I expected much more. Oh well I guess I can check this one off my list for Calgary."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. I've been 15+ times and they always hit it out of the park. I'm fairly dedicated to the rotisserie feature - the Sunday porchetta may change your life. On cold nights, get a spot at the counter near the grill."}
{"text":"Yummy!! My Husband and I have had a few date nights here, it is hard to get a table & and it tends to be quite loud - but the service is good and the food is even better."}
{"text":"3.58 is my rating..........I am basing this rating on my first and only visit thus far to Notable.   Here's the break down:  Postives: -the atmosphere and seating, intimate and nice dim lighting -comfortable seating -the olives...I can't put into words how amazing their olives are -really good food, but not amazing  Negatives: -when busy the service is really slow. But this is good to build up patience :) -not ideal for a family with young children -kinda expensive for not that amazing food -they run out of their specials which is disappointing -pretty loud when busy, however for me it doesn't take much for somewhere to be considered loud  Definitely worth another visit however!"}
{"text":"Second time there with friends treating my husband and I to our birthday dinners.  Amazing delicious innovative flavors again! Pleasant server.  The salmon was moist cooked to perfection.  My husband loved the bison.  Our friends loved the cod also cooked perfectly and her husband had the Sunday special pork and crackling.    Two desserts were ordered and I tried the Stilton cheesecake with rhubarb compote delicious and our friends shared and devoured lol the chocolate creme Brule.  They really enjoyed it.  Delicious delicious delicious! Entrees were 28 up to 40s and the meal is certainly worth the price five stars plus!"}
{"text":"The waitress said we should come back for dinner when we can stay a while, which was ironic because we had been waiting for 45 minutes for our lunch. She was friendly and knowledgeable. My meal was cold, not sure if it was supposed to be served that way or a result of having to wait 45 minutes to get it. It was noisy and very busy.  Fortunately, we got in early but that didn't get us in and out any faster.  Really love the Q water."}
{"text":"I saw very good reviews here and gotta say it wasn't as good as the reviews steak wasn't very tasty but the waiters are very friendly and maybe a less limited menu for lunch will make this place more enjoyable overall nor bad."}
{"text":"Wow. I was a little skeptical of the location of Iron Chef Noble's latest venture, was I ever wrong. The room is beautifully adorned and befitting of the wondrous food served within its confines. We have, easily, dined there, both lunch and supper, well into the double digits. All times, whether with family, friends, acquaintances, or mere business contacts, the food has been well received and praised by everyone at the table. A must have is the Friday night prime rib. It is sublime. It comes off of the hardwood fired rotisserie, and it is mammoth in its size and taste, accompanied by a hybrid au jus/gravy and beautiful seasonal veggies. And the homemade horse radish, incredible. Those of you not inclined towards slabs of succulent meat, try the Artisan Green Salad (root vegetables, so tasty) or Rotisserie Chicken Greek Salad (house feta, so yumma). The desserts, of course, are desserts, so delicious. Well done Chef Noble!"}
{"text":"I literally just finished lunch at NOtaBLE and felt compelled to write a review immediately.  I was going to have the Greek salad but then I saw that they had an open faced brisket sandwich. When our server told me it was sliced brisket (not pulled) I jumped at it since there were still some available. My husband ordered it too and he makes a point of NEVER ordering the same thing as me. It was the tastiest, most tender brisket I have ever had. I did not need a knife to cut the brisket, my fork flew right through it. It had a tiny bit of fat on some pieces which enhanced the flavor even more.  I hope they keep this one around for a while!  I don't live anywhere near here, but will make a point to stop in more often...I have been here twice before and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, close to home and great atmosphere. Love the live bands and the quick service."}
{"text":"Ok food, HORRIBLE environment!   We went for dinner on a Sunday afternoon, we had really high expectations as one of our friends had highly recommended this place. We started with the wood fire-grilled bread and garlic confit, I had the half chicken with risotto on the side and my boyfriend had the crusted tuna salad. We grabbed some coffee and the banana loaf for dessert and some vanilla gelato as well. Out of all the meals I think the best one was the tuna but the rest was just ok. The chicken was very greasy considering it's made on the grill...   For the entire time we were there we yelled at each other, the music was playing really loud and at some point we wondered if it was a restaurant or a bar.... When we left we were stressed out and tired. Will probably never go back as for us dinner is not just about the food but the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Got there just before their dinner menu started at around 4pm. It was full of breakfast, brunch and sandwiches. I had their Seared Tuna Sandwich. It was great. My Partner had the special (gourmet Hamburger), that was delicious too. We both had 2 drinks each and those were delicious. One knock from getting 5 out of 5 stars was the price. We ended up dropping just over $110 (incl tip). It'll make us wary for a late lunch to pay that much.  If I'm in Bowness again, I'll try dinner for sure, and stick to a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"Recently went for dinner on a weekend without a reservation( I would recommend making one...) we were quoted an hour wait. So we went to go sit in our car. Only minutes past and they called offering seats at the wine bar! We happily accepted, and then only after sitting down for a moment another staff member came over and said we could have a table if we waited just a few more minutes! I was super impressed with the team work and creative thinking of the staff there.  It made for a smooth dining experience. We keep coming back to notable for the relaxed open kitchen atmosphere, and of course the food! Excellent flavour combinations all cooked to perfection! The restaurant is consistently busy, wich can make for a loud restaurant. That is why I prefer to go for lunch."}
{"text":"This is an excellent neighbourhood restaurant for the Montgomery and Bowness area where fine dining is at a premium. Excellent food, service and atmosphere are evident each time we have eaten there. The Notable is a casual dining experience and unless you are having a major event plan on just walking in. Chances are you will be seated in less than 30 minutes. Reminds me of American restaurants in California where the food is dependable and good, the atmosphere is electric and the noise level is high, but refreshing. The menu isn't too busy, the ingredients are mostly local and everything we have had was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Wow there is fine dining in Montgomery and Bowness hood. My wife took me here and we both loved it. We started with this ravioli dish, then we both had steak dinners. I had the New York strip, she had the angus I guess. These steaks where so tender it could be cut with a butter knife. I recommend everyone who has never ate at a high end restaurant to try it. The food is reasonably priced as well"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite restaurants Ive been to. I had read the reviews about the long waits if you dont make a reservation ( and they only reserve a portion of the restaurant, so walkin can be accomodated) My friend and I were in the front area for about an hour and a half, but the staff brought us drinks, and made sure we were ok until we were seated.  The atmosphere was a lot more casual that I had expected, the servers dressed in jeans and matching shirts. This is a plus for me of course, I love good food in a casual atmosphere. I had the rotisserie chicken which I could smell, and see from the open chicken. It was amazing. My friend had the lamb, and stated it was the best he's ever tasted. The creme brulee with Phil & Sebastian was perfect. Not too sweet and creamy without being sickly. I love the fact that this place focuses on ingredients that are local, but the best thing is its not expensive! No more so than Earls, and the food is far superior."}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing. Well worth it every time I have been. My only note would be that it gets very hot in there in Summer, so dress lightly."}
{"text":"The ambiance and food was delicious!  Loved it, and think it brings a lot to a dying neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! The food was exquisite (The Tuna was amazing and prepared to perfection)...Service was above average, attentive without being in the way. The atmosphere was easy going and one was immediately at ease upon entering the restaurant. Wine selection was varied and included a good price range. For a delicious experience...experience notable!"}
{"text":"Oh, lord, we had to be rolled out of here.  Drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert--we were definitely in for the night.  We didn't have a reservation, but the wait wasn't long enough for us to even finish our drinks, so we were still feeling celebratory by the time we were seated.  We shared the lamb ribs and spinach dip to start.  Excellent comfort food, as expected, but nothing revolutionary.  Still, sometimes you want to order something and have it taste exactly as you expected it to!  For the main, I had the burger (it was a special for YYC Burger Week so I couldn't resist) and my dinner companions had the ahi tuna burger and a pasta dish that I can't remember now (there was also a bottle of wine in there!), but really, a burger is a burger wherever you order it and there's still the dessert to talk about.  It. Was. Incredible.  I had the chocolate brownie with salted caramel ice cream, which was a ridiculous indulgence but was so good.  Like, lick the plate good (blame it on the bottle of wine).  I recommend this place solely based on the dessert--sure, the mains are tasty and presented well and the atmosphere is sophisticated and welcoming, but really, it's all about the salted caramel ice cream."}
{"text":"Great place if you cab get in. Try the blue cheese cheese cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, the menu at Notable has included more fancy salads and refined dishes, taking focus away from the comfort theme that irked me. The Niçoise salad and the market fish (Arctic char) were prepared very well on my last visit, classy versions that showcased a good amount of local ingredients. The atmosphere was conducive to a casual business meeting, and service was prompt."}
{"text":"I might be having too much expectation to this place...which clouds my judgement. Overall, the menu is interesting, food is of great quality but somehow it didn't leave me feeling inspired, amazed or crazy about it. It just left me feeling uncomfortably stuffed. The portion they give to people is way too much. I was sick of meat in the next couple of days. I wanted to go back to give a fair review, but the thought of giant pork shoulder has hindered me from trying again."}
{"text":"Take your outta (or in) towners here for an unforgettable meal where the food is worth waiting for, the servers know EVERYTHING about the food and have a passion for their work..  The wine is pretty fairly priced.    ORDER THE FOLLOWING to leave amazed: Beef tartar with homemade chips entree: Swordfish dessert: Gluten free chocolate cake w homemade gelato (I am drooling again)  overall pretty fantastic.  the only thing that sucked was the wait time bc we didnt have a reservation, sooo if the hosts were faster at flipping tables instead of all standing at the door, they would have gotten 5 stars.  i'll go back, but I'll make a reservation next time!"}
{"text":"In fall 2010, we tried the aromatic-rubbed free range \"half\" chicken with house cut fries $22, Wood-grilled organic Spring salmon $28, and 28 day aged prime rib $34.  I think they said that the chicken was rotisserie with butter and herbs on the inside, which fuse delicately out into the chicken meat.  The chicken was very succulent and flavourful.   The salmon was fresh, sweet and very moist.  Jamie had the prime rib, he said it was the best ever, and he has dined out a lot.  Michael Noble competed against the \"Iron Chef - Masaharu Morimoto\".  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGBwaSA3w-Q.    He did amazing!  For dessert we tried the Stilton cheese cake.  The temperature of cheese cake (room temp) enhanced the flavor of the cheese.  I still dream about the cheesecake.  Paired it with a dessert wine, it was to die for.  I'm looking for a special occasion or any reason to go back.  Make sure to reserve early or you'll be disappointed.  What a gem!    Parking can be a challenge, you may have to walk a couple of blocks, so watch the heels ladies."}
{"text":"The food quality here is stellar. They have a chef who knows his craft. If you are a foodie, you will not be disappointed.  Having said that, I will sometimes deliberately choose another location for a meal because I find it horrendously loud.  You'll need rezzies, or you may not get it. It's a popular little place. I think one of the reasons is that there is no food of comparable quality anywhere else close by."}
{"text":"Notable has amazing food and great service.  Though expensive, the staff is great, and extremely proud of their food.  For a birthday adhering, we decided to make a reservation at Notable.  Over the phone, my friend had to place a deposit to reserve their largest table.    It was rather unnerving, though, we arrived, and after hearing that the whole table was full of foodies, the restaurant provided an extra entree, the ravioli, when they had realized that we had not ordered it.  The server proudly announced that we simply had to try it, since, it is a dish that requires 3 days of work.  It was amazing!  The other dishes recommended are the pancetta, as well as the prime rib.    Arrive early, however, as sometimes the daily specials sell out before the night ends."}
{"text":"So much for feeling special on my birthday. Not only did I make the reservation a few weeks ahead of time, they had the audacity to give us a corner table for four when the reservation was for six! Apparently we could have squeezed in...   But the manager did offer us another table so we thought we'd give them a chance. Wrong!  Our server, unbelievably rude and unengaged. Food was okay but nothing special, the wine list has changed and not for the better."}
{"text":"I went here twice. Once for a tasting menu, second time I just ordered multiple starter dishes.   I love the way chef serves his beef dishes, the mussel dish is just divine, flat bread with the olive paste is perfectly seasoned and the upside down Maui pineapple cake is to die for.   I think Chef Noble prepares the classic French dishes extremely well and he seasons his food to perfection (at least for me).    Service : I've had two different servers so far.  They were good but I've had better. I think the food out performs the service by far and they could definitely improve. (I'm being harsh but I am rating the service relatively to other restaurants which had food of similar calibre)   I will definitely be visiting often to enjoy his food and the comfy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. A little fancy, so not someplace I'd go ALL the time, but certainly perfect for special occassions. The decor is also super cool, and you can see the VERY open kitchen concept, which I love."}
{"text":"I must have gone there on a bad day.  I see so many wonderful reviews that I'm relieved that my experience may not have been typical.  Food - mine was okay, not what I expected from an award-winning chef, but okay.  However, other people in my party said their food was mediocre.  One person in our party said her food was revolting.  Service - bad enough that I will never go there again.  We had a very rude waiter who was overly familiar, presumptious, and thought too highly of himself.  He attended to us enough, refilled waters, and so on, but his rude remarks and overbearing manner overshadowed the meal.  None of us who were at the table that day will ever go again, nor can we safely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Exceptionally disappointing, totally overrated, have been waiting to eat here for a while and the food was average at best.  I can cook better at home.  I love the idea of gourmet comfort food but I expect more than this.  The service was also average, our server never refilled our wine and was scarcely seen.  It was not her fault, she was just overwhelmed with the workload."}
{"text":"I went while visiting Calgary for a weekend with two other friends. Their reservation list was already late when we phoned on Tuesday, so we decided to drop in on Sat.  We arrived at 6pm and the wait was already an hour.   When we did get our table, the service was friendly and good. The ambience was more casual than I expected but nice!  The enjoyed the open kitchen as well. We had the cheese and meats place which was varied and well portioned.   I had the Blueberry bison which was huge!  It was well cooked very filling.   I would return."}
{"text":"Notable is our favourite restaurant    We always receive great service . Our meal is always delicious  . I have many food allergies and restrictions which could  make finding something suitable difficult but at NOtaBLE the chef is always willing to even tweak a recipe for me ( for example making a white wine broth for the mussels instead of the cream one )     we do joke that the restaurant should really be called NO-table as its tricky to get in LOL but its worth the wait or thinking ahead to reserve :)"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant in a hidden location.   Food was phenomenal - creative and delicious.   Surprisingly large portions and a large selection.  Staff was awesome and the atmosphere inviting.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Make a reservation,  always busy."}
{"text":"NOtaBLEs feels elegant and friendly at the same time, as though when you walk in, you're amongst family.  Not only is Michael (owner) the most sincere bighearted person, he also \"walks the talk\", supporting locally sourced produce & meat, as well as live music; also generously supports local charities,   The menu is superb and most importantly, very consistent in terms of quality of both food & wines. My partner is a total \"foodie\" and I keep taking him back here because we are never disappointed. Their versatility while at the same time maintaining their gourmet character is impressive (options to accommodate food allergies, the fact that you can purchase taster and full versions of many dishes; they even do \"gourmet takeout.\"  Can't wait for their 2nd restaurant to open in Inglewood!"}
{"text":"Everything about this dining experience started out really well. Atmosphere was good, noise level was good, wine was good. When the food came, all our foods were very visually appealing, and the taste was really good.  For appies we ordered the mussels, the bacon on pork belly, and the potato rolls. For our mains, we ordered the scallops, a few of the roasted chickens, some ravioli, and the bison. Everything was really good, not too saucy, and tasted really good.  However, the reason why it wasn't a 5 star rating was because the temperature of the entire building was boiling! It's the middle of July in Calgary and a little air conditioning is much needed in a place that has a wood burning rotisserie and coal grill. Way too hot to be considered comfortable.  Especially after the period of waiting for dessert, the heat just bathes you in discomfort."}
{"text":"Good service, friendly staff, but not so good food. Reality didn't meet our expectations."}
{"text":"I never even heard of this place until I found it on Yelp. Contrary to it's name, I have driven by this restaurant many times without noticing it. After seeing some of the exciting reviews of this place I ended up here for lunch a mere 3 sleeps later. Instantly I was impressed once through the front door. The aroma was pleasant and the venue looks terrific. I wouldn't mind quenching my whopping thirst with a nice cold beer at the bar/lounge while waiting for a table to open up (apparantly Fridays and Saturdays are so busy you might expect a wait).  The server was both affable and efficient - my favourite blend. As soon as she told me what the burger of the month was, I had made my choice! Soon a presentable Lamb burger with (some kind of) cheese and plentiful fresh French Fries were in front of me and I had to decide whether to use my fork and knife or open wide. The burger was succulent, bursting with flavour, and cooked to perfection. I will come back 100%. The only problem would be deciding to try something else or just stick to the best burger in town! Expect to spend about 20 bucks for a burger (with fries) and a coke. It's easily worth it and beats spending 25-30 at some sushi restaurant (and I love sushi)!"}
{"text":"Quality of food was good. Prices were a little steep for the small portions. Service was prompt. Extremely smoky, overheard from the table beside us that fans were not working because they had their doors thrown open.  However, food took a long time to come out. But then again this was during their peak dinner rush. My only wish is that more or even all of their menu entrees were offered in taster and main sizes.  May come back, just not anytime soon..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything I ate there. The service was excellent even though they had, well, no table. ;-) I had the liver ... ridiculously delicious and perfectly cooked, which says a lot, if you ever had livers at a restaurant. I really like the open kitchen and roaster, really sets up a different atmosphere, and makes you hungrier and hungrier by the minute! Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"It's been 3 years since I have eaten here and I am just writing my review so it will be cut short as a lot of the food I ordered are probably no longer being served. I love the location, very pleasant charming eclectic spot in the bowness area. The restaurant environment itself is definitely my type, elegant , alive, warm, and simple in a way. Now to the food part, Our appetizers were these fried spring rolls with a smokey filling, awesome bold flavours in those. My main course fell short of what I was expecting from it. I ordered a lamb tenderloin dish served over risotto and seasonal veggies. Lamb was perfectly seasoned but wasn't cooked to my liking, understandable though the restaurant was BUSY, risotto could use more seasoning, vegetables were vegetables. As I always say.. I feel like this dish is lacking depth. I cannot remember what desert was, but I do remember that it was just ok. I will come back here again, hopefully I am more impressed this time."}
{"text":"Excellent scallops and romaine dinner...but for $36 only 3 average size scallops...ended up somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of what it means to be a great restaurant. It doesn't have to be expensive, or uncomfortably pretentious. All you need is great food and great service.   I managed to squeeze in a lunch/dinner at NOtaBLE between two events for work. I'm so glad that I did because I've been meaning to try this place for a while. When I came in at 4:00, the dinner staff was rolling in, and everyone was hard at work preparing the restaurant for dinner service. The level of production and cooperation as a team was phenomenal. It was like Santa's Factory, and Chef Noble was Santa Claus. One elf was washing wine glasses, another elf was shoveling wood chips into the rotisserie oven, and another elf was examining a hole in the wall or maybe the air conditioning duct... I wasn't sure. The best part about being here at this time was watching everyone come together as a family. Every staff member gets fed. Each of them grabbed a bowl, sat at the long table in the back and took a well deserved break before the crowds started coming in.  I got the lunch menu. Everything looked sooooo good. I can't imagine how amazing the dinner menu would have been. Although, I did get a preview of the juicy lamb spinning in the rotisserie oven. Mmmmm.   My server extremely helpful. She was able to help me narrow it down to two items: the nicoise salad with the panko crusted tuna and the cavatappi noodles with lamb bolognese (both taster size). The nicoise salad is considered one of the best in the city, and it probably deserves that award. Everything came together well, especially when I mixed in the yolk of the quail egg. Honestly, my only complaint is that I would have liked more yolk! The lamb bolognese was perfect!  I ended my meal off with the Stilton Cheesecake. I never knew that blue cheese could taste so good in a cheesecake, but it was the subtlety of the blue cheese that was surprisingly refreshing. The bruleed top was also a nice touch.  Food was excellent, service was excellent, decor and plating was excellent. A few last things: - they offer a take-out menu! A older fellow came in and got a rotisserie chicken to go. Big yums up! - I was considering giving this place 4 stars only because I want to up my standards for a 5-star rating. However, Chef Noble came over to talk to me, so for that reason I will not hesitate to give NOtaBLE a 5-star rating. - Lastly, very good-looking team! Especially the guy trimming romaine hearts. I hope he didn't think I was weird even though I kept on staring at him...   1/30"}
{"text":"AMBIENCE: Decently sized restaurant with an open kitchen. Haley, our server, was attentive and helpful. Dishes were introduced and every item of the charcuterie and cheese board was identified. 2/2.5  FOOD: Potato rolls ($13) with rotisserie pork and jalapeño jack cheese were very good, nice and crispy and topped with salsa and spicy ranch. The NOtaBLE charcuterie and cheese board ($26) was very enjoyable, with 3 types of pork, 3 cheeses, bread, apricots, pumpkin brittle, pickled cauliflower, and more. The ravioli of confit chicken ($16 small) was nice, but the cheese sprinkled on top I didn't care for. The grilled Alberta bison flank ($35) was the highlight of the meal, tender, served with an excellent brown butter jus, broccoli and potatoes. 2/2.5"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times now, and it never ceases to amaze me! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the monthly burger creation, which hands-down is the best burger you will ever have. I've also tried the Panini and the Greek salad, which are very good and the chocolate cake is absolutely outstanding! This place gets extremely busy, so even during the week, it's important to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Pretty good food in Calgary, service was nice. Food was pretty good. We ordered the beef tartar to start, the chips for it was a bit too salty, but the tartar itself was really well flavoured. I got their friday night special which was the 30 day aged prime rib. It wasn't too special, texture was very tender, but under seasoned. We also got the pork chop, it was seasoned really well and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Ive been here now 3 times and only kept coming back because i felt like maybe i was missing something? People keep raving about it saying best food ever but i dont think so! It smells delish and its ok food but definitely not the greatest dish ive ever had. I had the shrimp risotto last time and ive had better....  Beautifuly plated, smells great, great staff. Husband had the steak and it was pretty good. Amazing desert though!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Nice decor. A little pricey for the proportions.  The salmon was amazing."}
{"text":"I went to Notable with 6 people, we had reservations but had to wait 10-15 minutes past. The food was amazing! I had the New York strip and it was cooked perfect and the meat itself had so much flavor.  We had to wait a little longer for our entrees because of a large group in the back came in just before us and the kitchen was busy. However they comped our desserts for all 6 people so even though service could have being better overall they did everything they could to make it right.   Other little things, I am against paying for water however I did not mind paying for water at Notable. It costed $1 a litre and was filtered by a company called Q Water. It did not have a taste and was very good. Did not have a problem paying for that water. The other small thing that I liked is that the bathrooms are individual rooms. A very nice touch that I have not come across before.   Overall I recommend this to anyone looking to have a great meal and a good price. Not for someone looking for a casual meal or saving money. Expect at $60-80 for 2 people"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and creative. Tuna was fresh and tasty. Rotisserie chicken is juicy and seasoned to perfection.  Josh and his wait staff took fantastic care of us. The restaurant has a great energy without being overwhelming. One of the best meals I have ever had and a highlight for Calgary. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Don't know why the food heading says American. This is simply great food period that defies a label. One of the specials was a roast/grilled lamb sirloin with mergeuz sausage and white bean cassoulet. Perfection. Started with the steak tartare topped with quail's egg. A rare treat...get it?! Nice little chocolate dessert to close. Old vine Tempranillo wine followed by an impromptu wine tasting of the list with David. Chef, you've set the bar again and hit it out of the park. Good luck with the HVAC ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food great service, great price. Love the smokey flavours. Worth the stop anytime!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were having a walk when we spotted this place, it was our first time in Calgary. The restaurant had a nice vibe to it, and staff were friendly. I had the Grilled cheese of rotisserie chicken sandwich and the famous Salted Caramel Ice Cream sandwich for dessert. Food was incredible and fairly priced. Awesome place, I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had never heard of the place and I wish I had a long time ago.  Great atmosphere, delicious fine food but in generous portions, and, great service. The perfect place for both a date or dinner as a group: you will not leave hungry, and, you will have had a classy dinner. What else do you want from a great night out!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was like an hour and a half before they closed on a Wednesday night - it wasn't busy which meant my friend and I didn't have to wait......... a long bloody time before I got to eat something (I'll get back to my second visit later haha) We just went all out. From wine, to chicken wings, fries, calamari (I can hardly remember all the food was hypnotic). But, I wasn't really impressed with their chicken - that's just my personal take on it. It was dry. I know these guys are well known for their rotisserie chicken but it was dry. Everything else was great though. Service was awesome.  The second time I came here was just 2 weeks ago and holy crap we waited what was supposed to be 45 minutes, took an an hour and a half. It was a Friday night, they didn't take any more reservations (they actually only reserve half of the tables at any night). I ordered the special that night which was the prime rib... and again, the meat was cold. I ordered it medium and I got it medium rare. I know these guys don't fool around here but I just don't think its worth it.  Very nice restaurant overall. Its just a place I'd go once. The second time I was wishing I had waited for a seat at Una."}
{"text":"I'm kinda kicking myself for waiting so long to try this place because it's soooo good.  A group of girlfriends and I met up for brunch, and a rarity, but I wanted to try everything on the menu!   I was so undecided between the mussels or the seared east coast scallops, but went with my love of scallops. Normally, I do not like \"deconstructed\" salads. Why do you have to cut up your own lettuce? But in this case, it worked really well as the romaine was grilled and the char went really well with the tart caper dressing.   My GF let me try some of her mussels and we were pretty much ladling the spicy tomato broth into our mouths because we couldn't get enough of it. Why didn't we get more bread you ask? Because we'd polished off the giant loaf they'd already given us and didn't want to look like complete gluttons lol  Now that I know how great it is here, maybe I can eventually try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"First of all, had to pay $100 deposit to hold a reservation for 8 people. Only time slots available are 5:00 or 8:00 which are both bad times for dinner.  Then after paying $100 for reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes for our table.  Had the rotisserie chicken with linguine. Yuck. Didn't like it.  Even the chocolate tarte desert was not great. Thank goodness the gelato was - it was the only tasty thing I had, along with the wine. I would give 0 stars, but at least the waitress was good."}
{"text":"Notable does lives up to the hype. It has been on my \"to do list\" for ages and we finally went as part of a monthly supper club with a group of friends.  Here are the highlights:  Lobster risotto. I shared a taster with my sweetie and I think at one point I stuck my elbows out and wrestled the dish away from him. I had to stifle the urge to lick the bowl.  Double bacon wrapped swordfish with chick pea fries. SO good. Every detail was thought out on the plate and the chick pea fries were unlike anything else I've tasted  We also shared a salted caramel ice cream with chocolate torte-it was a special dessert they are offering right now. I am not a huge fan of chocolate or dessert but again, we battled each other for every bit. Another couple we were with had an issue with theirs in that she was counting the number of bites she had but he didn't, leading to an unfair consumption on his part. It was that good that it was worth fighting over :)  Service was excellent too, timed nicely which you sometimes don't get on a busy night like Saturday.  There were two things that stopped me from giving this 5 stars.  The first was that because we were a group of 8, when I made the reservation a couple of months ago I had to put down a $100 deposit in case we didn't show. It wasn't a hold or a credit card to secure the reservation-I basically had to pay it over the phone at the time of the reservation. What that meant was I got a $100 \"gift card\" to use towards the meal or anther visit. I get what they are trying to do but it is a bit clunky and I haven't encountered it at another restaurant before. I also had to ask for the gift card when our bill came, they hadn't brought it or applied it to the bill-it was like it was up to me to ask about it.  The second thing is that the harvest table (the only table they have for a group of 8) is right beside a \"fire exit\" door. It lead to a hallway where there was obviously some kind of private room and a function going on. So there was an incredible amount of server traffic behind me. It kind of felt like I was in the hallway the whole time and every time they opened that door, you'd get this bright burst of light from the service hallway. It was kind of distracting and kind of surprised me that  the logistics of servicing the private room when you also have a full harvest table wasn't better thought out.    I'll be back-more likely as part of a smaller group though!  Update:  I also didn't mention the automatic 18% which was really 19% tip on the bill as Crystal W pointed out. I know automatic tips are not unusual, but it seemed a bit high (we were a group of 8). We probably would have tipped that much anyway but it was a bit presumptuous and when you combine the auto tip, at that rate, over charge 1% and throw in the $100 deposit it makes me wonder if they want parties of more than  four to even come to the restaurant-its like we can't be trusted to show up and tip like good patrons."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, atmosphere and decor was refreshing and our server was awesome, friendly & attentive. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Went here last week with family from Vancouver.  Hubby went 6 months ago and said it was good.  When we got here it took them a long time for us to order.  It was a Tuesday night but the server did ask if we had anywhere to go....I have a toddler.....so yeah..I need out by 8 p.m.!  we ordered the Mussels (moule frite in most other places) and it was yummy.  I ordered the bison steak...medium rare and it came as medium WELL....the server did say she told them but she thought maybe because bison cooks faster.  Uh...then why did my father in laws flat iron steak (same thickness) come as medium rare?  She should have told the cooks what happened as my mother in law also had medium well...there's a big difference.  I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes so I ate the tough meat.  So overall...not worth the hype for me..meh"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is loud and lively, which were were happy with. I love how casual the atmosphere is, especially considering it's a a great place for special occasions. Our server was less than impressive. Very...blah and unenthused.  I expect a certain level of professionalism from servers, especially when they know that their customer is forking out a lot of cash and time to eat there. The food was delicious!  I was thinking about the pork belly appetizer for days!"}
{"text":"I came with friends for a Saturday night dinner. It's a busy spot (for good reason)! We  had reserved a table and we only waited for a little bit. For dinner I ordered their special, it was a boneless beef short rib with red wine jus, mashed potato with crispy onion, and carrots and broccolini, which was excellent, for dessert I ordered warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel gelato, which was also delicious! I would definitely go back!!! The food and the service were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"A revised version of Earls ....at this pint I prefer Earls much cheaper and no Chef attitude. This is another place where I refuse to go anylonger......the service was also very bad  when I ordered a glass of water she looked down at me....."}
{"text":"We went with a large family group.The food was excellent and expensive.They charged for water (really). The server,a young lady had some \"attitude\" issues.The tip was also automatically added on (about $50.00 tip).The music was blaring upon us from an overhead speaker,making the experience loud and uncomfortable.  I will shop around for a better place. The servers and the ambience are a large part of going out for a pricey meal, and this place lacks that."}
{"text":"Definitely, this restaurant tries hard to check all the boxes that make it a \"notable\" place to eat. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it was hard to get a reservation, because there was \"no table.\""}
{"text":"We decided to try NOtaBLE recently during Stampede week. It was very busy, but we got seated in the bar area within a few minutes. We elected to share dinner as if we were in a tapas bar, and also try some of the specialty cocktails. First off, the drinks were really terrific. The bartender took care and produced outstanding drinks. The food server also did a very good job, despite being very busy. The first couple of small plates we shared were excellent. We then decided to try a squid appetizer. As it turns out, it was over cooked and poorly done. When the server checked on us, we explained our issue and she very professionally handled the situation, and removed that cost from our tab. We then noticed a few minutes later one of the managers trying the same appetizer. As it turns out they were checking on this dish due to our concern, and concluded the same thing. They 86'd it, she told us that they had made a recent change in their kitchen and that obviously they were now struggling with that dish. It was refreshing to see a restauarant that took a real interest in determining the cause of a problem, and then doing something about it.  Overall it was a very good experience. Some very unique dishes and well trained staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"As always delicious, duck apply is unbelievable, and probably should have stopped there, but you, or at least i can't, needed to go for the rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes and carrots and broccoli(ne)  And two glasses of rickshaw.  How do you say, way too much!!  Server was fantastic, left me to myself, when she recognized i was working. Not pushy, but always available.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Really a hidden gem in Bowness. Went there for birthday dinner and server suggested a couple of dishes to try, needless to say they were very good. I wished we had sat at the bar, just so we could watch chef in action, will save it for next time."}
{"text":"Liked the decor and my server was very nice and helpful! They had a lot of tasty dishes, it was hard to decide (I wasn't super hungry). I had the Scallops with Romaine (Good)  and the Potato Roll (Great!) - I also had the Pineapple Carrot Cake (One of the best desserts I've ever had!!) - I've got to come back to try some more things!"}
{"text":"With so many restaurants opening in this city and it becoming borderline over saturated with mediocrity, we find ourselves coming to NOtaBLE more and more often. If but just for the guarantee that we will leave satisfied.   So often we find ourselves checking out new places (or new to us) and often leaving feeling underwhelmed and more broke than I already am. Sad mouths and sad wallets.     We've enjoyed NOtaBLE on a few occasions, one of them being after we had been to another restaurant that night where we were treated with the worst possible service and attitudes (see Trace F.'s review on Bonterra) that we essentially had to get up and leave and retreat to a place we knew would help recover our evening from disaster.  NOtaBLE.  Our most recent visit was this past Wednesday night where we enjoyed a decently priced bottle of wine ($52), a delicious starter and the Rib Eye (cuts like butter) and the Lamb. Both amazingly delicious comfort food with an unpretentious, pleasant server who timed everything perfectly.    NOtaBLE also gives the money you purchase for Q water to local charities as well as practices sustainability and prides itself in purchasing local.   Although it's an out-of-the-way drive for some people, consider how much time you spend looking for parking at a trendy spot right downtown and you'll probably save yourself half an hour going to NOtaBLE and finding a parking space right across the street. *GASP* and paying NOTHING!  Wednesdays are the new Friday nights. We''ll be coming back more and more."}
{"text":"It's good, check it out, but you'll need reservations unless you're ok sitting at the small bar."}
{"text":"Best restaurante we'be been in Canada so far. We ordered ribeye and burger. Steak was cooked to perfection and sides of vegies were really yummy. Burger same, juicy with wonderful fries The place has a really nice atmosphere and decor, you can see the grill and how they prepare their delicious meats. Service good and very good value for money!  Will definitely recommend it to everybody!"}
{"text":"Excellent upscale restaurant that you need a car to get to, so pedestrians take note. I was brought here for a first date, which strikes me as a little over the top (our bill came to over $200 which is kind of a lot to spend on someone you've just met, don't you think?) but there are worse things than being wined & dined at a great place. The guy didn't work out, but my dinner did and I've been a fant of NOtaBLE ever since. While they have vegetarian options, you're missing out if you don't order steak or lamb -- the best cuts cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The servers and hostess are RUDE!   THEY tell you to come in as they are not busy then you arrive and they tell you there are no tables available and there is a 45min   wait!   Ok this has happened a few times now!  Ridicilous!"}
{"text":"Ive been there 5 or 7 times for week end brunch or week day lunch. Service is efficient and friendly enough. Decor is great, and the food was pretty wonderful.  Coffee, however, is awful!  In a place that's all about taste, what's up with that?"}
{"text":"The place was packed, so make sure you make a reservation.  I mean why take the risk on the restaurant that everyone is talking about.   Big bright windows, great atmosphere and modern decor welcomed us.  We got our table relatively quickly (reservation!!!) and I was impressed how knowledgeable the wait staff was.   We started with the Salmon Belly appy, which is a sweet caramelized salmon and some delicious grilled bread and some tzatziki sauce.  A greek foodies dream come true. It was also perfect for garlic fans.   For the main course, I had scallops with grilled romaine heart with a bacon caper dressing.  The scallops were huge, it was like they were farmed in one of those lakes by the tar sands. :-)  Believe the buzz, this place is great!  ps.  If you wondering about the restaurant's name, the capitalized letters spell out the last name of head chef Michael Noble."}
{"text":"This is continues to be my favourite restaurant in #YYC. The food is fantastic, the servers very capable and the vibe enjoyable and fulfilling."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for quite a while and have driven past it the few times after taking my son to football games at Shouldice. I made a reservation for it about a week or so in advance. The restaurant takes reservations for 50% of its capacity, and the other half is for walk-ins. I'd suggest making a reservation, because it's pretty busy on weekends. (Friday & Saturday). I was there at 5:15, and it was already almost completely full.The exception being the bar/lounge side. The service was good, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The kitchen was busy, so it took a while for the food to get to our table. I had the scallop appetizer, which also comes as an entree. You get two scallops (medium size) with 1/2 a romaine head grilled,with parm cheese and bacon pieces. It was tasty, the scallop being cooked quite nicely. The only gripe I have, is it worth $21.00 for two scallops ?    I also had the rib eye steak, It was a 12 ounce and it came with finger potatoes, broccolini, and baby carrots. The veggies were done nicely, but my steak had so much grisell that I had a hard time chewing it. Their were other people around me that ordered the same, and didn't seem to have the same issue I did. I had one piece in particular that was so hard to chew, that if I could've spit it out I would've. If you like to have a glass of wine with your dinner, expect to pay about $10. a glass. To finish dinner, I had the creme brulee which came with a small cookie which was pretty good.  In conclusion, it was a pretty good meal that I could say was good. Will I go back ? probably not."}
{"text":"I was a guest at a business lunch at Notable today. I did not know the price of the meal but I have no doubt, it was pricey. Over all, the food was delicious. My potatoes were slightly under cooked and could have used some more butter or sauce to moisten them. I had two salads and they were both spot-on - delicious! We were not offered coffee or tea or given a chance to request it for dessert. So the ambience, service and the over all experience was good and I would consider going again."}
{"text":"Classy place suitable for diverse appetites, polite and social waiters/waitresses, and btw the Ravioli was one of the best ones I have ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to NOtaBLE for date night very last minute.  We knew we would wait but we also knew it would be worth it.  When we arrived we were told that it would be a 45 minute wait but we only waited 5 minutes because we took the \"hot seats\" at the bar in front of the rotisserie (which are some of my favorite seats in the house).  Sitting at the bar overlooking the open kitchen is tons of fun & still a great dining experience. We were surprised when the people sitting beside us had one drink & left because they didn't get a \"real\" table.  We couldn't decide on what to get for dinner so we decided to share a few things.  We got the grilled flatbread with olive tapenade to start and then shared the mussels with frites and the burger of the month (meatloaf burger) with a side salad.  The burger was AMAZING.  Quite possible the best burger I've ever had.  It was made from ground pork, ground beef and pulled beef.  YUM!  We finished up dinner with a piece of Stilton cheesecake.  The service this visit was not as good as last time we dined at NOtaBLE.  After dessert I actually asked \"Where did our server disappear to?\" because he disappeared into thin air and left us patiently (mostly) waiting for the bill.  We weren't in a huge hurry but we were done with dessert & didn't order coffee so we were ready to go.    Even with the service hiccup, this remains one of our favorite restaurants and we will definitely be back.    Flatbread, mussels, burger, cheesecake and two bourbon and cokes was ~$95 before tip."}
{"text":"What an excellent night out! Booked their private function room for a large family celebration. Contact was easy to work with and helped me organize our special supper. The Group menu was a great balance of choices. Their half chicken is very moist and flavorful. And the mushroom risotto melts in your mouth. The potato rolls with pork are a fantastic appetizer. So was the scallops with grilled romaine hearts. Decedent desserts of Stilton cheesecake and the chocolate pudding were a lovely end to the meal. Plus staff and chef did a great job with gluten free dietary requirements. Lots of choice!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations about this place, I was thinking it was going to be superb, but it ended up being subpar with a couple positive attributes.  I took the visiting fam here for a Sunday brunch and to my surprise we were seated quite fast (within 5 -10 mins) and we got seated in a nice booth at the back (win!) but shortly after we noticed that the AC was cranked on high (it's winter outside, c'mon folks) I didn't want to complain because I'm certain it was to cycle the air flow through since it was and probably gets quite smoky in the place without it.   Shortly after we got settled our friendly server came over to take our drink order, that's when the real wait began. I frankly don't mind to wait - it's Sunday brunch at a popular restaurant in Calgary but my family aren't used to that, they are small townie and that makes me feel bad because I always want people to have a good time - especially if I suggested the place.  So anyways we wait for our drinks for some time (water, coffee and a soda)  then we place our order..... after that we sit, and sit and sit....it doesn't come out for over an hour, to be expected? Maybe? My parents weren't huge fans of their dishes and neither was my other half - mine was good but simple, it was a Greek salad with pulled roasted chicken but seemed a bit greasy even with the dressing on the side.   When the bill came I didn't think it was worth what we ordered, but what can you do. Will I come back? Probably not... I wasn't wooed and the experience/food was reminiscent of a Earls brunch."}
{"text":"Top notch burger. Lots of flavour, well chosen fixings and leaves you well satisfied."}
{"text":"I booked a week in advance for our anniversary.  The only time they had was 5:30.  I was very excited to go I've heard some many good reviews on this place.  We drove  45min because of the time. Rush hour!   Even though I told them we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. They sat us out in the middle of the restaurant not in a private booth.  We said we have never been there before.   The service was awful we never had our water drinks filled and once the the meal and as served we never saw our server.  They didn't even acknowledge our anniversary.  Will not be coming back here!   Huge disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation two weeks in advance for Dec 23, 2012 for a table for five.  It was a VERY cold night but the restaurant was hoppin!  The decor is lovely, the staff were clearly proud of their restaurant and food offerings.  Our table ordered the Pancetta, bison, rotisserie chicken, and rib eye steak.  We all thought our entrees were very good.    We did experience two negatives.  Firstly, the noise level in the restaurant was crazy.  I could barely talk to my mother who was seated beside me and I had to resort to sign language to talk to my son on the far side of the table.  Not the kind of environment where you want to linger.  I know this is not easy or inexpensive fix but something NOtaBLES needs to look into.    Secondly, we ordered the Wood Fired Grilled Bread with Black olive, sundried tomatoes and basil tapenade.  The bit of tapenade we had was AMAZING!  We tried and tried and tried to eat the grilled bread but it was BURNT!    Every bite!  When I talked to our server about this, she respectfully said that this is how the grilled bread comes and that even if she ordered another one for us, she knew it would come back the same. Come on NOtaBLES, we couldn't  even enjoy the tapanade because all we could taste was burnt toast!  You need to change how you are preparing it.  Who cares if it is \"Wood Fired-Grilled Bread\" if you can't eat it!  Our server did take this order off our bill without me asking her, and I appreciate the fact that she did.     I love the fact that this lovely restaurant is not downtown, so it is easier to get to.  I love the fact that it is in a neighbourhood.  Next time we are in town, I will try it again.  Hopefully, NOtaBLES will have worked out some wrinkles."}
{"text":"I have been lucky enough to have two meals at NOtaBLE.  Dinner with the #yyceats crew from Twitter & then again a celebratory brunch with my sweetie.  Dinner was amazing!  They were gracious enough to accommodate our large group (we reserved well in advance and took some juggling on their part.)  They let us linger as long as we wanted, despite being a busy Saturday night.  Most of us enjoyed many courses. Our waitress was knowledgeable and tended to our every need.  Months later, I still dream of my starter - Ravioli of confit chicken, roast mushrooms and Borsin cheese - $15 (taster) - I cannot recommend this enough.  That said, I am glad I opted for the taster size, as I think I would probably find it too salty if I tried to get through a meal size portion.  Also had the pork chops, which were magically cooked just how I like them!  Very juicy with an almost impossible pink tinge to the middle. (Despite what we were taught growing up, pork chops do not need to be cooked until dry & tough.) The vegetables had the perfect amount of crispness to them. Who wants soggy veggies?!  A lovely french press of coffee to accompany dessert a s well. Their coffee  is top notch for what you would expect in a restaurant.  Brunch was decent. You could definitely walk in & get a table around noon on Sunday afternoon (we still had made reservations.) It was difficult to narrow down my options, with there being breakfast & lunch offerings available.  I chose \"Eggs Benedict\", rosemary ham, brown butter Hollandaise, cheddar scone ($17) - the eggs were perfect! It came with hashbrowns.  Far more than I could eat.  I did find it a little heavier than I like and would have preferred half the amount of hashbrowns & had a spoonful of fruit as well.  I have to admit I was slightly surprised that it was not a terribly balanced meal.    As for service, wasn't terrible on this visit, but was not amazing either.  Our server refilled our water carafe without our asking, but failed to ask if we wanted more coffee.  Then she brought our bill automatically without asking if we wanted anything else.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  We will definitely be back - likely for dinner.  Definitely want to check out the hot seats!"}
{"text":"Because Bowness Rd was closed right in front of the restaurant, it was a bit complicated to find parking. However, we did eventually find the parkade that the waitress told us about and got to enjoy free parking.   The food was very good. I think the food is what saved the overall experience. Our server was very nice but the wait, holy moly, we waited so long for our food. I'm a very patient person, even when I'm super hungry, but this took way too long."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great. Will be going again.  Baked Crab was 5 stars. I shared the burger the was good and the pork tenderloin and that was over cooked. But the risotto under the pork was 5 ***** omg I would have that as my main. I might check next time if they would do that :)"}
{"text":"Been here many many times and it never disappoints. Whether its been lunch or dinner it's always been wonderful.  We have ALWAYS made reservations so I can't speak of just showing up and not getting a table. It has always been busy!  The food and service is always top notch and we will continue to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place less than a star.  Last night  my wife and I were there for our anniversary dinner. It felt like a ZOO. Absolutely NO PRIVACY because the tables are set up so close. The lady next to us shook up our table when she was trying to get up to greet someone.  Everytime  someone was trying to pass by behind me was hitting my chair or had to lean over my back to get by. VERY NOISY.  Food was very SALTY and tasted like lots of ingredients came from PROCESSED CANNED FOOD. PRICY respect to what they serve.  Waitress serving us was NOT FRIENDLY and had lots of attitude. Toward the end, without even telling us what she was doing, she took off with the credit card mechine with my credit card in it and came back after a while. Never even apologized. The whole experince was not something anyone want to remember.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  One was during burger week; utterly fantastic!  Honestly, every detail is considered and addressed.  The kitchen runs like a finely tuned Swiss watch.  We loved watching the staff do a tasting for the dinner service.  It looked like a family dinner!  I went again with my business partner and a supplier.  He was really impressed with the service and food and said it will be his go-to place when he is next in Calgary.  We were equally thrilled.  If you get a chance to go, sit at the counter and enjoy the show."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for dinner when she was visiting, and this place is even better for dinner than for lunch. My mom absolutely loved it and so did I! The place was packed on a Wednesday night, so that says something - NoTable is POPULAR!  Every thing we ordered was delicious - perfect really - and for dinner as good as this, I dont mind paying their prices. At the end of the meal, Chef Noble came to our table to say hi and had a great little chat with us. This elevated our experience by several notches and we left extremely happy diners that night!  Totally worth the trek to Montgomery for this restaurant! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys GREAT food, and a world class atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First visit and I had high expectations for this restaurant considering all the hype from my research. I ordered the prime rib, which was the daily special and was quite disappointed. It was quite over cooked. As oppose to the beef tar tar, which I found was nice. The service was great but too bad they were not able to cook prime rib properly.  Disappointing."}

{"text":"Despite the raving reviews.....sadly Notable didn't do it for me and to be fair... I've been there 3 times.  Over priced - quantity VS quality .....Notable is no table which is common at their restaurant. Once they realized this they made arrangements and compressions to the table layout to increase profits...unfortunately though, you can usually hear the people in the next table chewing their food...way too close for any kind of comfort.   Prices on menu remind me of the Fairmont Hotels restaurant menu prices, difference being you don't regret paying for what you get at the Fairmont!!  Reputations are built by word of mouth, don't forget that Notable. Don't get greedy...stick what made your restaurant so reputable in the first place.   Thanks for reading and best of luck if you decide to hit up this place."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in the city. I live on the opposite side of the city and still find myself here fairly often. The food and atmosphere are amazing.   We went there this year for my birthday with a group of 8 and the food, drinks, and service was exceptional. The only thing I have to critique is that when a party of 7 or more people is at their large table and there is a private function being held in their private room, the group table is made aware of this. We sat at this group table and half way through our meal people kept walking by to go through the door that was at the back of the section. Unfortunately it's not a very big space and because there was such a large group of people going in to that private room we were constantly being disturbed. And not just disturbed but bumped. I ask the waitress if they could go through another door to get there and she said that they couldn't and nothing more was done to accommodate us unfortunately. So based on this experience I wouldn't go there with a large group again because it kind of put a damper on the evening. But I would return with a smaller group in a booth setting."}
{"text":"Derek surprised me with a dinner at Notable with my family for my birthday this year and it was our first time trying this restaurant.  The restaurant was very busy, which is to be expected for a Friday night, and therefore very loud so I think next time we go it'll be a weeknight when it might be quieter or earlier in the evening.  Derek had booked a month in advance and the earliest reservation he could get that night was at 7pm so it is definitely an evening you need to make arrangements for very far in advance.  For appetizers the four of us shared the smoked scallop and shrimp bake and the elk carpaccio.  The elk carpaccio was awkward - not enough crostini with LOTS of watercress, however the parmesan aioli and white wine mustard were delicious, and the carpaccio itself was delicious.  The dish could just use a little tweaking to make it easier to share without a huge mess of greens everywhere.  The shrimp and scallop bake came out bubbling hot.  It was super creamy with lots of shrimp.  It could use more scallops but my family loves them so we always want more, even when we cook them ourselves.  For mains we had asked the server if there were 4 portions left of the prime rib and unfortunately he forgot to check so we'd had to remind him, but at least when he finally did check for us there were 4 left so we were able to snag them before someone else did.  The portion sizes were enormous.  It came with a square of scalloped potato and some vegetables.  The vegetables were good and the potato was delicious.  The prime rib was really good, perfect medium rare, but so big that we all took leftovers back to my place where Derek and I had steak sandwiches for two days afterwards.  We didn't have room for dessert we were so stuffed.  I'd love to go back, but I definitely think a weeknight would be better so we could talk without yelling at each other."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner when I was in Calgary as I heard some good things about this spot. I must say - I wasn't really impressed. It's located outside of the downtown area, and there's no parking or anything in front of this - only street parking.   Anyways when I got in and looked at the menu, nothing really stood out. I got a steak, and it was medicore. It was definitely not worth the price - I've had much better steak for cheaper. Service wasn't bad, but I couldn't get over how expensive this restaurant was - for mediocre food!"}
{"text":"After I got over the confusion of a high end restaurant located in a dodgy montgomery.. I gave my head a shake and entered. I have been for lunch and dinner, both simply amazing. Many options on the menu, and everything is made to perfection. Finally a restaurant that views food preparation as an art.  Only thing I could possibly complain about is that the staff should be wearing more professional attire... I dislike the blue t-shirts... but really, that's me scraping the bottom of the pudding cup.."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had the Chocolate Chip Banana Bread French Toast. It's literally amazing chocolate chip banana bread, made into hot french toast. Comes with a side of bison sausage. All round 5 stars, simply delicious!!  My friend had the eggs benedict and said it's the best she's ever had. Two for two. Can't wait to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Notables was my choice for a special occasion and I was not disappointed. I ended up ordering the lamb and my husband got the flatiron steak. We got the potato rolls to start and they were totally rocking. Glad I asked for the waitress's recommendation because I would never have picked potato appetizers had I not. Service was impeccable. Carolyn was very friendly and made us feel that much more at home."}
{"text":"I love NOtaBLE.  We tend to go at least once a month. Although, it isn't really aimed at kids we do take our 9 year old fairly often and he too enjoys everything about it.  This week we snuck in a quick midweek lunch.  We arrived just after noon on Wednesday and the restaurant was fullish, but we got a great table.    I do like the servers in the evening better than at lunch, lunch is good, dinner is great.  Very often the staff will come by our table to say hello even when they aren't in our section.  In fact, recently one of the hostesses moved to a downtown spot and called me by name the last time I dropped in there.  This personal touch really gives this up scale spot a homey feeling.   Food is terrific.  I have honestly loved everything I have had there.  I think it is great that the hamburgers change frequently as it gives me a great excuse to go back.  Wednesday I had the Niçoise salad which is my go to item and as usual it was fantastic.  For dinner it is the lamb which is consistently on the menu but shows up in different forms so I never get bored.  Food sources are identified on the menu and I love that so many local farms and ranches are represented so often.  The only downside, is that everyone likes it as much as I do and getting a reservation is really tough.  It is worth the wait"}
{"text":"I found the food good, but not great. The portion was quite small for the price. Also, I found the service quite rude."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and was hoping to try NOtaBLE. But too many things were going on But I was fortunate enough to be at an event that was partially catered by them. And I am so happy!   I had more than my share of their savoury roasted chicken. I think it might be the brst chicken I have ever tasted. A really unique blend of seasonings. Hoorah!   Now I want to go to the restaurant even more."}
{"text":"I like this place...... Very busy..... Great menu! Food, service,prices all good and only reason I didn't rate higher was atmosphere..... Too noisy for a fine dinning experience"}
{"text":"Been to notable 6 times now.  I like all the food here. Drinks are soso (Hence the 4 stars) my girlfriends and I tried several cocktails and none were very good.  Huge selection of wine which I like!"}
{"text":"I went to NOtaBLE for dinner tonight with my date. We had the lamb shank, the ceviche scallops and the tuna tartare.  I personally felt that the lamb and the tuna tartare were both very bland. The scallops were quite delicious though. The service was great but expected from a restaurant of this calibre. The decor was nice, very contemporary.  If i were to go back again I'd as for the \"hot seats\". Overall, it was a decent meal but it wasn't anything amazing."}
{"text":"This was on our must-do list for some time and I am SO glad that we made it here tonight! Parking was a breeze on the street as we arrived here at 9pm on a Friday night. The restaurant only takes resos for half the restaurant which is good for people like us who do not like to be nailed down to a time. On Fri and Sats, the kitchen closes at 11pm which is great and the rest of the week is until 10pm. The dining lounge was full when we arrived but in my opinion, we got the best seat in the house in the lounge area right close to the kitchen. It was a little warm but not uncomfortable by any means. You can see all the action happen in this fantastic open kitchen space. It was nice to see hostesses that were actually at their stand to greet you and the service was AAA all throughout the night.  I liked that I could order wine by the glass and there were a couple of beer on tap as well. We ordered the mussels with frites and the burger of the month. I had seen these mussels on line in photos and there was no way I was going to deviate from my choice even though the pastas were damn tempting (esp. the duck confit one!)! The mussels were CDN, huge, fresh tasting and the fries were so good. Everything was well seasoned and everything seemed to be made by someone that gave a #$%^&! I could taste the passion in the food.  The salad that came with the burger was lovely. Tiny detail - the aioli on the burger could have been on the meat perhaps and not the bottom bun but it made for that wonderful, messy experience. However, the burger had to be eaten quickly as a result!  This was for sure one of our better dining experiences overall since we moved to Calgary. The owner/chef was on Iron Chef??? How cool is THAT! One of the sous-chefs spoke to us too as we were leaving. That never happens right? He seemed to be a really nice guy who loved what he does! Just added a bit to the great experience. We learned that the restaurant is open for lunch daily and brunch on the weekends is available at 11am. Thurs and Fridays are prime rib night and wow, it looked good coming out of the kitchen. That was the beauty of our seating, we could see everything leaving the kitchen! (Seared tuna for me next time!!!) The ambience throughout the whole place was elegant and modern, great lighting. The portion sizes of the food gave great value and I thought the prices were very reasonable. We will be back - often!!!"}
{"text":"Review #8 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012.  Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Overall experience: 3.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  My first visit for dinner was about half a year ago. I had very high expectations because of the buzz surrounding Notable, but I left very disappointed with an overcooked lamb dish. Fast forward to this weekend, I decided to give this place one more try.   Half of the seats are for reservations, which I HIGHLY recommend for the weekend and the rest is for walk-ins with wait times of at least 1 hour if you arrive past 6PM.   The restaurant has a classy yet casual and home-like feel to it with mood lighting that makes it a great place for a date. Another highlight is their open kitchen concept where you can watch the chefs grill your meat with their rotisserie grill or stare in awe at executive chef Michael Noble. However, the most detracting thing about the restaurant was the waiting area where guests would crowd around the front entrance and close to the kitchen area. If I had a table close to the door, I would be peeved off at others \"intruding\" on my meal.  The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable of the wine and food.  The menu is divided up into a few sections. They have their seasonal dishes with wine pairings; sharing plates that can either be a taster/appetizer size ($8-$20) or a main ($15-$30); and entrees (chicken, lamb, salmon, beef) from their recognizable rotisserie grill ($30-$40).  Drinks are fairly expensive and subpar with cocktails from $10-$12 (1.5oz).  I found that I was more impressed and satisfied with Notable's appetizers than their entrees which seemed pedestrian. For $30+ a plate, I expected more grandeur flavours and techniques. On the plus side, the portions are fairly large and the ingredients were fresh.  Appetizers:  - If you plan on going to Notable this month I highly recommend the seasonal appetizer, \"Queen Charlotte black cod Lobster with mushroom duxelle (mixture of various mushrooms) and mushroom consommé\" ($18). It was presented beautifully with a creamy puree underneath the cod lobster to cut the saltiness of the mushroom duxelle.  - \"Artisan greens salad, house pickled vegetables, Provencale dressing\" ($9) is not worth getting because of the small portion size and the lack of various pickled vegetables. However, it was well dressed and the dressing had a well balanced tang to it.  - The \"Wood fire-grilled bread with garlic confit\" ($6/taster; $10/main) turned out to be slightly burnt, soggy, and limp. Additional dips such as the overly salty \"black olive, sundried tomato & basil tapenade\" are $4.  - \"Seared East Coast scallops\" ($20/taster; $32/main). For a taster size, you receive one abnormally large scallop with a grilled romaine heart sprinkled with bacon bits, cheese, and a bacon & caper dressing. On its own, the scallop was really salty and didn't have a nice sear on it. Would NOT recommend.  - I highly recommend \"Ravioli of confit chicken, roast mushrooms, Boursin cheese\" to share ($16 taster/ $24 main). The taster size comes with about six raviolis filled with flavourful tender chicken, immersed in a delicious buttery cream sauce. I wanted to lick the plate! Pasta was a perfect al dente.  Entrees:  - My friend ordered the \"Wood-grilled swordfish\" ($34) on top of wilted spinach and sugary glazed fingerling potatoes. If you haven't had swordfish before, now may be the time to try it since it was cooked fairly well here. Expect a meatier and denser textured fish with a mild taste. A spicy panaag curry sauce added an extra kick.   - I ordered the \"Grilled AB Bison flank, with bing cherry & walnut butter\" ($32). There was an ample amount of bison grilled to a perfect medium rare. If you've never had bison before, the meat is leaner and tastes gamier than beef. Due to the cut the meat, it was somewhat tough, but flavourful with a nutty note from the brown butter.  Dessert:  - I decided to try their signature dessert, \"Stilton Cheesecake\" bruleed, with a rhubarb compote ($9). Although I hate blue cheese, I decided to try it because it was a signature dish and my server said they only added a 'hint' of stilton. If you love blue cheese I highly recommend this dessert. The blue cheese flavor is delicate and the texture of the cheesecake was extremely moist and creamy. Great dessert, but I couldn't handle that much blue cheese.  Overall, I feel that Notable is slightly overrated. I had a decent time and the food was mediocre to good, but nothing to rave about. Nonetheless, it is still worth checking out. Just be sure to make reservations and expect to pay a hefty price for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Wonderful  & Knowledgable staff!!! My favourite/go-to restaurant to take family or friends or for a special night out with the Man!"}
{"text":"5 star drinks 5 star food  Waiter was awesome spot on and attentive without being annoying until it was time to go and it took us 20 minutes to get a check.  Unreal scotch and steak was enjoyed. What a great find in this area!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal and never leave hungry! NOaBLE has it all covered. The daily specials are always imaginative and put together with such care. Every ingredient is fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more when it is a meal I would never be  able to make myself, NOaBLE is just that, comfort food with a gourmet flare. My favourite is the take out Happy Chicken. Full rotisserie chicken all packed up ready for home."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, service wonderful but the girls at the front desk we're rude and inattentive, when my wife and I arrived they looked at us with that \"what do you want, could care less look\" we had to prompt them to speak, had we not of had a reservation we would have left. To bad these two spoiled the atmosphere."}
{"text":"While the name can be No Table sometimes, it's still a wonderful restaurant. I live in the area so I'm here quite a bit and personally have never had table troubles.   They have a wonderful weekend brunch, and this time of year you are able to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine, or if you want a little A/C inside is still gorgeously decorated.   I have never had a bad server here, it can be slow at times, but if it's busy I am understanding. Being a celiac always poses challenges and hats off to Notable, as when I tell the server, they ask the cooks what I am able to have and let me know. Which is a very nice touch.   The food is great, I've never had a bad meal there and I do enjoy the menu gets changed up now and then, so you get to try new things.   The one downfall is, it's relatively expensive, it's not just a quick in and out dinner. But if you are looking for a nice place to meet friends, for a date or even a family dinner, Notable is definitely on my top 5 list."}
{"text":"Always love Notables! Service was outstanding! Everything was outstanding, Duck Confit, Prime Rib, Chocolate Pudding, great date night!"}
{"text":"Great farm to table option in Calgary. The chicken are always spectacular. You can taste the freshness in the menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"With Michael Noble at the helm (a World Culinary Olympics gold medalist, an Iron Chef competitor and former executive chef at Catch and Diva at the Met), I knew that this was a restaurant worth a visit during our trip to Calgary.  Our experience at NOtaBLE  was almost \"NO TABLE\" because we could not secure a reservation for our entire week in Calgary, but fortunately they retain 50% of their tables for walk-ins so by arriving early we were able to get in without a wait.  The restaurant is located across the street from a tattoo parlor and a Pizza 3000, not exactly the epicenter of fine dining, but once you enter the premises, the location seems immaterial. The restaurant is abundantly tasteful and elegant without pretense. The wait staff wear jeans and t-shirts so it would be difficult as a patron to show up underdressed.  We were a dining party of 4 that had some special requirements, namely one person in a wheelchair and another with severe food allergies, and the management and our server, Karin, were extremely helpful and accommodating.   We started with the day's soup special, a striped prawn and stinging nettle bisque. It was silky, subtly flavored and delicious.   For mains we jumped all across the menu and ordered scallops, chicken, lamb and a flatiron steak. Beside the dish modifications for food allergies, the kitchen was happy to oblige sides substitutions, so we replaced the potatoes and fries with their spicy tomato Boursin risotto. As far as we were concerned, all of the dishes were home runs.   We shared a couple of desserts, a chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée and a salted caramel chocolate cake, both were very good, but in retrospect probably a bit much after our large meal.  The weak point of the evening was in fact the house coffee served, it was rather underwhelming.  Despite the fact the restaurant was at capacity, the kitchen did a pretty good job of turning out the food in a timely manner. Our dining experience lasted two hours, two hours I would gladly repeat the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Excellent meal the Flatiron steak with cherry sauce on top from the bison dish. Vegetables and steak were amazing. If your visiting Calgary as I do a few times a year it's a must for dinner or lunch. Had the grilled romain lettuce which was outstanding also. Suggest making a reservation as it gets crowded. Good service and great job NOtaBLE"}
{"text":"It was my brother L's Birthday and he wanted to celebrated it at NOtaBLE, which I was definitely pretty excited for.  However, the celebration was nearly ruined... you see, if you want to make a large group reservation at the restaurant, you need to put down a $100 deposit in order to hold it, and if you need to cancel it you will get it back in the form of a gift card.  I don't necessarily agree with it, but I made the reservation anyway since I didn't think we would cancel it.  So last night on my way to the restaurant my brother calls and says... hey, they don't have us down for a table.  Um, what? I know I called and my Visa was charged the same night.  He's like yeah I don't know, but we don't have a table.  So I told him to wait til I get there to sort things out.    So I got there and they managed to put together some tables for our group, but the actual table that we were supposed to be sitting at in the quieter, less busy part of the restaurant was given to another group.  I was not impressed.  Then our server Genessa comes over and greets us with the $100 gift card, welcoming us... to which I was quite confused.  My name and reservation date was written on the gift card, but my reservation was actually not recorded in the book.  Sure, the hostess came by to check the gift card receipt to see who charged me and who took down the reservation, but that was it.  I wasn't expecting a free meal, but something more should've been done.  A large group of 9 with a baby in the busiest part of the restaurant was not ideal seating (the DB behind me slammed his chair into mine when he got up - no apology either).  Anyways, good thing Genessa saved the night.  She was a fantastic server and we did end up enjoying our evening.  You can count on the food at NOtaBLE to be good, however the whole reservation thing really left a bad taste in my mouth.  It will not deter me from returning, but they need to be a lot more organized with their reservation system.  I've always wondered why they don't do online reservations like OpenTable or Yelp SeatMe.  I'm glad the evening turned out to be positive overall.    Overall, come for the good food, but don't expect the service to be impeccable."}
{"text":"2011 review - Flank steak done perfectly medium rare, halved roasted baby potatoes, cherry tomatoes In balsamic and sea salt  Yowza  2013 review, same excellent steak only fingering potatoes and a side salad  Again I am impressed"}
{"text":"Sat at the rotisserie section - way too hot. But the chefs are very friendly and always offer some neat information on the food. Nice wines by the glass, great sparkling water, and great portions. I ordered the pork burger with a salad. My boyfriend ordered rotisserie chicken sandwich with fries. I also ordered salmon belly appy - tender and cooked perfectly. Though it tasted more Chinese than Japanese. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was used for the sauce. Next time we'll save some room to try the cheesecake. Can't wait to return and try some of their other dishes. The food did take a long time to come - I think we were at the end of a lunch rush. I didn't mind, though I don't think I would come by if I were in a rush to get back to work."}
{"text":"Ugh! I don't understand the hype of place! when my friends and I ordered our food, it  took exceptionally long to come out during lunch hour. The mussels we ordered as an appetizer were strong smelling and under cooked. When we talked to the staff about the mussels they simply replied, \" they must be different than what your used too, Have you had them here before?\". When our meal arrived, the pasta my friend ordered was soaking in an inch of olive oil. I understand olive oil is good for people but NEVER that much. My french fries were tasteless and hard.   This place is an over priced let down."}
{"text":"I loved there prime rib Thursday's when I lived close by, there chicken was always really well done to, never had a bad meal here, if I lived closer I would go weekly!"}
{"text":"The front of the building is under construction but the restaurant was open and rocking on a Friday night.   Sat by the grill and it was more than a little warm due to the grill and wood fire.  The aromas from the grill was great all evening.   I was there with a decent group and we were treated fabulously.  I arrived late and the waitress took extra time to make sure I knew the specials and made more than one suggestion for dinner.  I was sold when she said sous vide Duck fat and bacon is surrounding the pork chop.  The presentation was great the portions of of Quebec pork was more than I could eat.   We had a wonderful Bedrock zin.   chef noble has another restaurant in town and rumor has it he won an iron chef competition in Japan.   The flavor pairs in some dishes is different but they all come together very well.   The prime rib is aged 30 days.   The food was fabulous and I enjoyed every minute in the restaurant.   I will look up his other place on my next trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"Amazing!   The girls in the front are always,  so so nice. Food was, (last week) as always,  so delicious.  What I love about Notable is consistency, some restaurants you can get great food  one week and the next day or week  not so much. I've been to Notable over 30 (min)  times and I almost always order the chicken, everyone else experiments.  Amazing!!!!   Not one of our friends or our group leaves with with (was an off night).   I have never found a great place for chicken in Calgary, until I ordered it by mistake at Notable.  Best mistake ever!   :-)     You'll always leave happy that you got a great meal.  The waitresses are also wonderful- and no I'm not related to the owner :-) promise.   Kudos to him and the chef!!  Please excuse this less than perfect review though you get the basic ( it's great) as  its about 3am."}
{"text":"I ordered the rib eye meal.  I have never had a better steak in my life, ever. The accompaniments looked so simple but were cooked to perfection (broccoli rabe, carrots, and potatoes) and I licked the plate clean in about 15 minutes. Sounds really basic but you'd be stunned how many places screw up roasted potatoes.   Followed it up with the delicious chocolate tart (served with hazlenut ice cream and toasted pumpkin seeds) and a cup of coffee. The coffee was so delightful that my dinner date, who is the kind to dump all kinds of sugar and cream into coffee, had it black and actually enjoyed it immensely.  Can't say a stitch of a bad word against the food, but holy cow, the service was SLOW. SUPER slow. We arrived for a 7:45 reservation on a sunday (just a little over an hour before closing as it was starting to empty out/slow down), and we didn't get our appetizer (flatbread) til 8:15 (literally just toast) and weren't eating our entrees til almost 8:45. They didn't rush us at all which is great, but I was disappointed in the speed. The server herself was lovely though, and I'm willing to chalk it up to an isolated incident and will definitely give an update if/when I return.  We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Went here in September 2014. Service was great though we did have to wait an hour for a table. It was a Saturday night however so that's expected.  They asked us to wait in the miniature foyer however which would have been very uncomfortable, so we opted to sit outside in the cool air which was preferable.   Food was good, not great. No major complaints and quality seemed OK. The price for the food was high though in my opinion."}
{"text":"I kept going back, hoping I'd missed something. I haven't.  It's not that the food isn't good, it is. It's just that the value is poor. At these prices, you can eat almost anywhere in town and there's no comparison to the quality of the cookery, and the flavors you get at Divino or model milk.   Also, the T-shirt uniform isn't clever or cute, it's stupid."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night based on the reviews below.  From all the hype I'd heard about NOtaBLE, I was expected more and left underwhelmed.  The food wasn't bad, but I expected some more variety in the menu.  Nothing really jumped out at me like \"WOW!  I have to try this!\" or \"WOW!  I need to come back for this!\""}
{"text":"We love this place. It is so nice to be able to dress a nice casual, sit down have some awesome drinks and great food. Its non pretensious and that's whats so charming about it. A little off the beaten path in terms of location, but well worth the drive. Apps to love are their ravioli, potatoes rolls, and their scallop and bacon vinaigrette salad! But I'm sure everything in the apps is amazing. These are just some of our faves. For Mains the pasta is fresh, our pork tenderloin was top notch and the gnocchi was referred to as crack!!!!!!!!! It was a mix of mushroom and bacon and I could have eaten a plate of just the gnocchi !!! The lamb was succulent and perfectly cooked. All the meat is fire roasted and you can't beat that taste. For dessert we had the Stilton cheesecake, which was interesting and yummy! We also had the chocolate tart and that was mouth happy dance worthy. For drinks, a must try ladies is a Moscow mule. Its vodka, ginger,lime and ginger beer! So crisp and refreshingly delish!!!.  Can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Just amazing!! We fell in love with this little gem"}
{"text":"7oz naturally raised pork & wild boar patty with double smoked bacon, pickled red onions, housemade aioli with truffle shavings, homemade foie gras butter with madeira and maple syrup, oka cheese, local lettuce, tomato on a fresh house baked sesame bun with a dill pickle on top. I really enjoyed the burger, there were 3 of us and we all ordered the YYCBurger in support of YYCBurger week. Out of the 3 one was a bit dry but otherwise good. The burger was flavourful and well blended with everything working in harmony and no one ingredient playing diva to the others. The only complaint I had was the tomatoes were too crunchy and tasteless but other than that the burger was great. Service was great and handover from our waitress to our waiter for the dinner shift seamless. The restaurant tends to be noisy when full. Reservations are always recommended unless you want to show up before 5:30 like we did. This is my 3rd visit to NOtaBLE and the service has improved greatly from my 1st experience there where we waited over an hour for our appetizers to arrive. The food is consistently good and the last few times arrived in a timely fashion. It's a lively place so if I wouldn't say that it's a good place for an initmate conversation. As to parking, I have to say that I have never experienced any problems with finding street parking close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Notable is my new favourite restaurant in Calgary. I went once awhile ago for lunch and the food was very good and the service was fantastic. I kind of forgot about it until my boyfriend and I went there for a celebratory dinner recently. We never sat without a drink in front of us. The waitress continued to fill my wine glass as we went through the bottle. The serving staff and bartender were knowledgeable and helpful with the food and drinks. Our appetizer was THE BEST app I have ever had! Crispy potato rolls - It was 5 deep fried potato skin rolls, wrapped around pork, avocado, tomato and a green salsa and chipolte sauce. I will return just to eat this app alone, let alone how fantastic our mains were. I had a pork tenderloin and gnocchi meal and my boyfriend had the daily special. We will be back again for my birthday this month :)"}
{"text":"veal was ok.  mixed veggies were enticing.  What was not great was the fact that the order was forgotten while the kitchen staff were all high-fiving.  I'd stay away from the bread sticks as something was off about them and the white pea hummus dip and others.  potatoe meat fingers were delicious."}
{"text":"this was such a great evening...  Everything about this restaurant was good (except for the noise level!).  Our meal, the Tues special of lamb' was incredible.  Wine list is very good.  TWO DAYS LATER.....Went again because the food/ service was so terrific.  Food/service was again wonderful but for some reason our meal took 40 minutes to come out.  Others in the restaurant were serve before us, after coming in AFTER us.  only negative...everything else was superb."}
{"text":"We came to notable on a weekend girls trip away. The four of us were seated immediately for a late Saturday brunch. We ordered the breakfast panini, torta espanola skillet, eggs bennie, and biscuits and gravy. The waitress was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The atmosphere of the restaurant was warm and inviting. The restaurant is bigger than we expected with an open concept kitchen where you can see the chefs at work. The food was served quickly and the presentation was impeccable. None of us could choose what to order off the menu so we all shared each of the above items. Unreal! The eggs were cooked perfectly. All the bread items were freshly made in house. The passion for creating and serving fabulous food was obvious among all the staff who choose to work at this restaurant. We all highly recommend coming here for a meal or many! We will be coming back to Calgary for dinner here!"}
{"text":"Wow - we were so impressed by NOtaBLE!  It was my husbands BD so we went to this lovely neighborhood gem for dinner. We were amazed that we managed to get a reservation - but a cancellation at the last minute was lucky for us. It was much larger than i expected and the open kitchen was great to watch the chefs at work.  The only downside was that there were a few parties close to where we were seated which had several small children and another had a baby. I guess that comes with having such an early reservation. The hostess was gracious enough to move us to a table a bit further away.  The serve was wonderful and the food was amazing!  My husband thinks its the best meal he's had in Calgary to date (we've only been here 1.5 years). Nothing was overcooked and the portions were generous. Next time we'll come in for wine and dessert only - they looked amazing but we had too many dishes and were more than satiated when we left.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The restaurant lived up to the expectations posted by other reviewers. We had a party of 5 and the wait was reasonable. There is parking available under the restaurant and is accessible from the alley. If the door is locked to access the garage, go back to the restaurant and they will show the alternative way back to your car."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal. The portions were good and the quality was super! Great atmosphere! Really good service too. They weren't accepting reservations however, we were able to have a drink while we waited and able to get a table fairly quickly!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best food and service I've had at a Calgary restaurant in years. I had the ribeye steak and my wife had a rotisserie pork dish. I can definitively say that the steak was better than ones I've had for double the price. My wife loved the pork dish as well. My compliments to the chef. I would highly recommend Notable to anyone looking for world-class restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Terrible old school, uninventive food. Tried five dishes, nothing was good (barely any technique or creativity, meat was chewy and huge cuts of inferior quality stuff). Service is decent but nothing great.... Tab was quite expensive. Urgh...."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. For real. The building is new. The restaurant itself is not overly large with a seating capacity of 155. It seems smallish. Which is not necessarily a detractor. There is lots of commotion - chefs cooking, open flames, sit-down area where the chefs make magic, high wall seating in other areas and a view of the patio and beyond if you dare. This place, when close to full, is noisy. Really noisy. The food is the primary reason why people come to this place. It is first class. Really. And on Bowness Road no less. Who would have thought? The portions, as one would expect, are small. A 6 foot plus hungry man might not find this place fun. Not at all. Quality or quantity here. The prices? This ain't cheap. Two main dishes with H20 will run you $50 with a tip. No Kidding. The drinks aren't cheap either. Although I did spot one beer on the menu for $6. The service is prompt and efficient. The food came quickly and that surprised me. The view from the patio is what got me though. This beautifully done establishment across the road from a strip mall that seems to have stood still over time, hard and harsh. My last bite did not go down quite as well with the last gaze to the other side. I hope these fine entrepeneurs make a go of it. It is obvious they have put much thought, time, money and effort into their vision for fine food in this city. If you go, make sure to get a seat as far away from the windows - there's something to look at all right and it ain't pretty. And parking is a real issue around the restaurant. You will know what I mean when or if you get there. The alcohol haze or the fact that one has extracted a great deal of cash for the experience might explain the overly generous ratings online. Create your own reality, your own story in your head, as they say. Believe what you want. You decide. All in all, for my money, I prefer the Red Water Grille Northside or Southside locations or Cibo on 17th or the like - comparable food, better pricing perhaps and views to make you wish for more. For real. Expen$$$ive."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for a while now and finally went the other night for dinner with my brother who was in from out of town. It was a hot day so we sat out on their patio.  The patio was very small with cute little folding rustic wood tables. Our server was quick to greet us and get us some drinks.  We ordered the shrimp and scallop bake to start which was unfortunately way too oily but had great potential as the flavor was good. Our server said its not usually like that and was nice enough to take care of it for us. We decided to share our mains so we could try more then 1 dish. We ordered the confit duck with strawberry, arugula, goat cheese salad and the mussels in coconut broth. The duck was really good however I thought it could use more greens and more of a goat cheese crumble as the chucks of goat cheese were just too much. My favorite was the mussels, make sure if you order a baguette on the side to soak up all that delicious broth!  Great meal with awesome service!!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequently dined at this restaurant and it is one of our favourite's.  The food and service is excellent and the plating good. Prices are fair but slightly high for the portion size..... but again great food.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Went Thursday Jan 27th for my gfs birthday.  Bigger restaruant than it seems from the website.  Almost full at 6:30pm.  We had a nice little booth, near the back of the restaurant.  Buiness casual older crowd, feel free to wear jeans, but some people were dressed up.  Servers wear jeans.  Food was AMAZING.    Mussels and fries with dip for appetizer.  Huge mussels, and tasty fries.  Main courses: GF had salmon, with shrimp and potatoes, she liked it.  I had the rotisserie special of the night (thurs and fri) Prime rib.  WOW, huge piece of meat, cooked perfectly.  I couldn't even eat it all.  Came with brocollini, carrots, and a tasty scalloped potato, sweet potato, bacon and cheese mix.     Dessert was choc cake with choc ice cream.  Ok.  Beers were $7, and my gf had a $12 cocktail.    Pros:  Amazing food.  Cons: Very noisy inside.  No free bread.   Bowness.  Located on the other side of the street of pizza 3000, glad we didn't go there for dinner.  Worth going to, but have a reservation, and bring your rich friends to pay."}
{"text":"Wow.  Fantastic food.  Exceptional service.   First visit and restaurant has exceeded in all departments.   Ordered for appetizers the potato spring rolls and sweet soy chicken wings. Both unreal and delicious.   Wife's entree was strip loin with vegetables and fries.   My entree was pork tenderloin with risotto.   Both were large portions and top notch.   Finally ended dinner with creme brûlée with two mini donuts.   Again fantastic restaurants with one of my best service experiences in Calgary. Highly recommend for family and friends for any occasion."}
{"text":"We were ten mins late for our reservation and they had given our table away but they still managed to get us a new one in about ten more mins. The place was packed and people were lined up at the door waiting for a seat on a tuesday night. Our waitress was busy but tried her hardest.   I really wanted some still bottled water but they have still water that they filter through a special process. That's great it really is but it's paying money for tap water in the end and a proper bottled still water will be from a spring which is what I like. Plus I have a thing about getting my water from a sealed bottled. So I ordered hot tea and a glass of unsweetened cold tea. The hot tea had alcohol in it so I had to send it back since I don't drink alcohol. Although I tried to drink it first but she could tell I was miserable trying to choke it down. So I got a hot tea as I had ordered in the first place.  We ordered three appetizers to share, the neon squid, rabbit taggetelli and beef tartar. The neon squid was cooked to perfection and seasoned beatifully. The beef tartar was so drowned in the sauce that it could have been cat food instead of beef and you wouldn't have known. I was really disapointed as I love beef tartar and also ketchup is the last thing I would put in tartar. The rabbit was cooked perfectly again but covered in a sauce that was bland and tasted like something that would come in a package.  Colin asked the waitress to pick a wine to come with his entree and she forgot to bring it till he was half way done his steak so he wasn't very happy with her service. He ordered the ribeye and I had the lamb. Both of our meats were cooked so perfectly I had to close my eyes while eating. I was sad to find my risotto under cooked as I have been on a mission to find the perfect risotto. The dessert was the best part of the whole thing and I could have sat all night and eaten it. I had the creme brulee and I also ordered a tablespoon of the salted caramel ice cream to try. The ice cream was thick and had a crunch in it. The flavor was sweet with a real bite of true sea salt. The creme brulee was light and just the slight flavor of sweetness. Plus it came with two tiny cinammon donuts. Yummy!  In the end our experience was a little bit of good and bad but in my mind more worthwhile than not. I can't wait to try it again if nothing else than for more dessert."}
{"text":"All I can say is that its reputation is well deserved. One of the best meals I've had in Calgary (I don't live here, so my sample size is admittedly small). Meal was perfect."}
{"text":"We were there with a large group of friends (kids and small babies included) for brunch. this was the first time we were trying the brunch there. the service by our server was amazing, and all other staff were also very welcoming and accommodating to our needs; if it was just the service, staff and atmosphere of the restaurant, I was giving them definitely more that 5 stars; however, the food was not something special considering the price! We ordered different dishes, steak and egg, Salad, soup of the day, Burger, Egg benny, etc.  Steak was just average, burger was overcooked; other dishes were also just average in taste and design.  My expectation was way higher from what I heard about this restaurant and they could not deliver to my expectations in regards to the food quality, food taste and food design. However, as mentioned earlier, the atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the staff were amazing."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The Steak was very nicely done and the bacon appetizer was amazing..will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now: opening night with family for Friday supper; twice with colleagues for weekday lunches; and once by myself. The food was delicious each time, the service warm and friendly. I'm already a regular, and I knew when Michael Noble opened his restaurant barely two blocks from my office building I would find another reason to not miss working downtown. I recently tried the Stilton cheesecake, their signature dessert. On that basis alone, NOtaBLE deserves its name."}
{"text":"The gem of the NW. What a treat to have a downtown quality restaurant waiting for a convenient date night up in the NW. Really delicious food and drinks and wine selection. Menu can be a little difficult to interpret and know just what the hell exactly you will receive, but that's typical of these upscale, hipster type spots and is part of the fun. Haven't had an item on the menu yet where I've been disappointed. One of the first places that comes to mind when I ask myself where I should go for dinner on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Back again to one of my favourite places in Calgary. The tastiest salad ever, great food and atmosphere. Love this place"}
{"text":"I've been to NOtaBLE a handful of times, most recently tonight for New Years Eve, and it has always been amazing. NOtaBLE has consistently had good service, amazing food and a clean and comfortable atmosphere.   We brought my parents there tonight for dinner and I was initially a little apprehensive because they are pretty picky and don't always share the same taste in restaurants as my sister and I but my apprehension was all for nothing. We had the mussels and scallops as an appetizer and the prime rib, lamb, chicken and lobster specials as our entrees. Everything was delicious and our server was friendly and attentive. I haven't seen my parents enjoy a meal like that in a while. I'll definitely bring them back there for sure. It was a great choice for our New Year's Eve dinner!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  Phew. I got that out of the way.  since we moved to Calgary, Notable has been recommended as one of the top restaurants in Calgary.   Well, having dined here tonight I would say that I am not particularly impressed.    We started with their seasonal wonton prawns which were heavily coated and served with a tasty medley of pickled vegetables and ginger mayonnaise based dressing. Honestly they tasted largely of grease  For entrees we ordered, on waitress recommendation, the pork tenderloin with truffle gniocchi and mushrooms and the lamb sirloin with cassoulette.  The pork was somewhat dry and under seasoned. Unfortunately it was not the 'star' of the dish. The gniocchi and mushrooms were delicious. It would have served better in our humble opinions to have the pork cooked in the same sauce  The lamb was cooked perfectly and was well presented. It was tasty but heavy on the beans. Would have done well with a little bit more veg  We did not try dessert.  Our coffee drink ( which was served with burnt  coffee) was spilled and we cleaned it up at the table. The spill was completely ignored despite 4 soiled soaking napkins on the table.   Overall the server seemed inexperienced.    Decor was reminiscent of a Brewsters or gastro pub.  We will likely not return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Expect to wait a looong time if you don't make reservations as this place is always hopping with people.  The fact that it's still this busy even after the initial novelty wore off, is always a good sign."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed in the service, atmosphere or the food! Tonight we had new menus features - the Chopino seafood chowder- subtle, complex flavours and beautiful presentation, beef tartar done so well and  a favourite chopped salad with Gouda, bacon , egg , shrimp and olives. Portions generous, wine menus varied and service very responsive. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Heard plenty about NOtaBLE in Bowness Calgary as a great restaurant to try. The parking wasn't clear at first as the entire building is under renovations on the outside and the only parking we found was on the street...however we learned they had underground parking, which unless we were there prior...not sure how we would have known.   The atmosphere is pretty nice and would definitely say it had a nice vibe. We arrived in between their lunch and dinner switch over which made some things confusing but handled well with having two different servers during our stay.  The food was pretty good for the most part, however the feature entree missed the mark by a mile. One guest at our table seemed to have ordered all the wrong items because everything she had was dry and tasteless...while everyone else had delicious meals. She basically had a massive slab of meat...like a pork chop that was dry. Even the dessert she ordered was over cooked and dry. Bad luck for her....kinda funny and was the joke of the night. Everyone had to try her dishes to confirm. However, our beef tenderloin was really well cooked.  Overall a good evening. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but it was worth trying for myself."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner at Notable. Nice, contemporary dining area. Ordered the Duck sausage and the DH ordered the rotisserie chicken, which is their signature dish. The food arrived pretty quickly, and the DH said the rotisserie chicken was moist and meaty, yet it lacked any particular spice or flavor, which is  disappointing since the waitress said it was their signature dish at Notable. The chicken  came with fries that were just lukewarm, which was disappointing. My duck sausage dish came with two duck sausage links, mashed potatoes, and sauteed asparagus. The duck sausage was very good and very flavorful, and I really enjoyed the duck/pork mixture. The mashed potatoes were also very good and tasted fresh and homemade, And the grilled asparagus was still nice and crisp. I enjoyed my meal more than my hubby enjoyed his (I tasted his rotisserie chicken, and I have to agree that it had no distinct seasoning or flavor to make it stand out.), thus only the 3 star rating. However, I would try Notable again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"If I have to sum this place up in one sentence: NOtaBLE lives up to the hype.  Rolling in for a late lunch around 2, my mother and I were pleasantly greeted and promptly seated.   Our server was a total pro, filling us in on the specials within minutes as well as our drink choices.  We settled on 2 Wild Rose Cherry Porters (my fav WR beer) and a carafe of sparking water.   NOtaBLE filters their own water, and then you have the option of still or sparkling and the $1 goes to charity.  We both had the spinach salad to start, and I have to say, it has forever changed my opinion. Even after the salad was done, I kept craving more of the vinaigrette and pickled onions.  Our mains were even better, the server recommended the feature burger (which changes monthly) and boy, was she ever right.  The bison/beef patty was succulent, the homemade bun soft and warm, the toppings crisp but the absolute best part was the grainy mustard and mayo sauce on the burger.  For $16 it's quite simply the best fine dining burger I've ever had. And at the best price too.  The fries with sea salt were also perfectly crispy.  Ending the meal with a french press of coffee (no espressos available) and the Stilton cheesecake, we were in heaven.  I feel I should also mention the server's attire: they all wear the same shirt and jeans or slacks.  While some might find this inappropriate, I love it. I'm so sick with the \"little black dress\" so common in Calgary restaurants. It does not compensate for server's lack of ability. I prefer intelligent, informed answers about the food and wine list. Not cleavage and a giggle.  The only downside to NOtaBLE is that, even though it's on Montgomery (and if you know anyone ignorant enough to refuse an invitation because of the \"sketchy\" neighbourhood, take someone more deserving) is that it's busy all the time. I couldn't even get in the next week for dinner.  But, after a meal like that, I'm going to keep trying."}
{"text":"Good meal. Good portions. Good value for lunch. Had the beef brisket sandwich and thought it was nicely done with a great salad. After meal drip coffee was a fine finish. Would come back and try the dinner."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times over the years..my last visit  was a birthday celebration at the Harvest Table complete with a visit from Chef Noble. Fast forward to the present and it was definitely time to drop in again. We gathered a group and settled in once again at the Harvest Table. The entire experience was wonderful. Our waitress was fun, bubbly, knowledgeable and clearly loved her job. There was too much food to document it all, from appetizers, to mains to dessert.  Everything was spectacular but the dessert was definitely the show stopper for all of us. From the Stilton cheesecake to the Dulce de leche crème brûlée...it was insanely delicious. Continual impeccable service, delicious food and a warm, cozy environment keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place does not really need a review, everyone know it's one of the oldest, and best restaurants of its kind in the area. We had one of the best steaks we have ever tried in Calgary here. Great place for small groups, or for a date night. On weekends go for a brunch that is hard to find anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town. Favourite spot at the bar in front of the \"fireplace\"."}
{"text":"LOVE Notable! Or is it No Table? ;)  I've been waiting to try this restaurant ever since it opened up. My mom is there way too often and last weekend I finally had an opportunity to join her and check it out! Since then I've gone once more, and I know I'll be back again and again.  My mom and I arrived right at the dinner rush, and of course we didn't have a reservation. I would definitely recommend one - it is ALWAYS busy! At least we were able to order a glass of prosseco to sip on while waiting in the crowded entrance. The place was bustling and energetic - quite loud actually - so not somewhere I would go on a date but rather after work cocktails and dinner. We were seated and immediately ordered a bottle of wine and some oysters. Our waitress was a super cute, bubbly thing who knew my mom by name (and even remembered mine when I returned the second time) and she was fantastic! After the delicious oysters, we decided to split the mussels and the salmon entree, with a side of risotto. Everything was SO yummy, especially the risotto! Since it's on the menu as \"Chef's Risotto\", I'm guessing it changes often and I will definitely be back to have that again. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food for the both of us, but we left STUFFED! It was pricey, but with the wine and oysters (plus the fantastic service!), it was definitely worth it.  I returned last Friday for drinks with a friend, once again the place was packed. We managed to grab a table right by the door, which wasn't my favorite, but we made due. Starting off with cocktails, I ordered the \"European Love Affair\" - sweet and simply delicious! We split an order of the potato rolls, which were lovingly dubbed \"crack\" by the server, for good reason. These little things are tassssty!!! Must be why it looked like EVERYONE in the restaurant had ordered them as well. Of course, I had to order the mussels again - they are undoubtedly the best mussels I've ever had! The spicy Thai coconut broth is absolutely amazing, and dipping the bread/fries in it afterwards was heavenly. I plan on returning weekly for that delicious dish - I'm afraid I've started what could become a serious addiction for me...  The food, service, and atmosphere exceeded all of my expectations for Notable. I am in LOVE! The only downside is parking in the area sucks, but we could all stand a walk every now and then, amiright? Cant wait to return for lunch (when there is hopefully less of a wait)!"}
{"text":"When we have a babysitter for the kids, heck, we've even brought our kids, this is where we go. I would say that Notable is the most outstanding restaurant in Calgary for many years now. Always make a reservation to not be disappointed, the menu is creative, the wood fired oven always smells amazing and the different cuts of meats mean that you can try something new and what you wouldn't normally cook at home.  We are a huge fan of charcuterie boards and try one whenever it shows up on a menu and by far Notable's is the best. Coupled with a killer wine selection, knowledgable servers, an open kitchen where you can watch all the action is why you will keep coming back. A real Calgary treasure.  Sure parking can be tricky but get over it and enjoy a walk in a neighbourhood that would not normally have a top restaurant, would you you rather have to drive to boring downtown???"}
{"text":"One of those restaurants that make the night special. Fantastic food and service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience, and nice little surprise. Tucked away in Bowness, but the outside didn't particularly strike as unfitting, yet the inside is gorgeous. Definately has the new vintage contemporary feel, with the upcycled brassy tables, glass overhead lamps. Mix crowd of casual and dressy on this busy Saturday night but overall really relaxed. Be sure to make reservations as it does get quite busy.  The food? Amazing. Attention to detail, tastes, textures are impeccable. The crab and shrimp dip is a  MUST try, absolutely taaaasty. The thai style mussels were spot on.  My halibut was juicy to the last bite, the lamp leg was soft and tender. I managed to mangle a peice of steak off someone's plate and that was equally impressive. Just wait- I haven't even gotten to dessert.  My only irk here is that our waiter neglected to inform us that the iced tea is brewed in house, and is comparable to sugarless crystal light. Yeh, someone should call Nestle and tell them Noteables is stealing their stuff.   But DESSERT made the WHOLE experience. It was an experience for the eyes, the stomach, and the soul. Chocolate hazelnut brulee? 8 stars. Lemon meringue pie? 10 stars and the entire milky way. The lemon bits were just the right amount of tarte, and the meringue instantly became creamy to the tongue but held its form on the pie. Now THAT is a lemon meringue pie.  Looks like I will be coming here much more often!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because I've heard nothing but good things from people and I'll agree the food is AMAZING. However, I found my experience relatively frustrating. We didn't have a reso when we walked in and we were told we could sit in the lounge which we were totally fine with, but we waited close to half an hour for a spot in the lounge which we would have been okay with except there were open seats for us to sit. I asked the hostess about this and she just find of ignored me. Then our service was incredibly slow, but the food did not disappoint. I definitely want to come back here and give them another chance if only for the food! I would recommend making a reservation, but do so well in advance this place books up!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of eight. It was my second time eating there. The first time I had the Prime Rib. It was OK. I remember being a bit let down because I couldn't get it the way I wanted. I like mine more on the rare side and it came medium. Not a huge deal but when you pay the price they charge it's nice to get what you like.   Now for last night. I started with the chicken ravioli. It was seasoned nice but I couldn't tell it was chicken. The filling was very pasty the sauce was nice. It came with caramelized carrots and they were the star of the dish.   Another couple had the mussels. They let me try one and it was excellent. Someone else had the Scallops, the one I tried was overdone for my taste.  For the main,  I had the Swordfish and it was disappointing it was on the dry side but the vegetables were wonderful again. Not worth the 30 plus dollars. My wife had the bison. Personally,  I have never been a fan of bison and the bite I tried didn't change my mind.   Another guest had the dungeoness crab. This was probably the biggest disappointment. For all we knew they could have opened a can of crab meat,put it in a sauce along with some shrimp and cheese. We could see the shrimp (They were very nice) but the crab was pretty sparse.  THIS DISH NEEDS WORK.   Two people had the burgers and frites. I wonder,  if McDonalds changed the name of their fries to frtes would they double the price.   One guest had the rib eye steak. He was too busy eating to comment so I assume it was very good.   To put our meal in context,  if we had the same meals at our local mom and pop restaurant I would rate it a ten ( I know there are only five stars here ) but when it is billed as gourmet, fine dining I would be hard pressed to give it a three star rating.   Perhaps the problem is the size,  high volume could mean lower standards. Come on Notable you can do better."}
{"text":"This place is a-mazing. Service was attentive and helpful. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the mussels as well as the scallops. Both were spectacular. We will def be back again soon. Also heard chef opened up a new place in inglewood. Will need to put that place on the list to try next."}
{"text":"Notable was recommended to us by some friends who now live in Bowness (I [heart] Bowness, word). So as our anniversary was approaching we decided we'd check it out. Ends up, it was a pretty solid decision.   A quick breakdown of Notable: - Owned by Canadian chef legend, Michael Noble, Notable is quite new on the Calgary restaurant scene.  - Located in dodgy Bowness, you're in for a people-watching treat. - Go early, go late, make a reservation or be prepared to wait an hour for a table. - Cool menu offers a select choice of dishes available as \"tasters\" or \"mains\" - No espresso, but serve French-pressed Phil and Sebastians, which is tight. - Quaint patios with headers offer an awesome \"cool-Calgary-night\" alternative. -Serve Canmore's Grizzly Paw sodas  What we had: Lobster salad \"mini buns\", chili garlic butter - $24 (main). This dish comprised of five \"toasts\" with a diced lobster salad mash on top. It was decent. Felt like I was eating lobster SPAM on garlic toast. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have this again.  Ravioli of confit chicken, roast mushrooms and Borsin cheese - $15 (taster). Loved, loved, loved this dish. The ravioli was definitely hand made and, with the accompanying buttery sauce goodness, melted in my mouth.  Pulled rotisserie chicken, cured bacon, Broxburn Farms tomato, lettuce sandwich - $15. What is really a glorified chicken club, this sandwich had me craving more. The mayo offered the perfect condiment and the bun was like the lightest focaccia you've ever had. Side house-cut fries bumped this from a 4.5 to a 5 star dish. I would definitely have this again.  Chinook honey creme brulee - $9. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. This dessert came with blueberries and an almond nougatine that did a great job putting the finishing touch on a great experience.   What we liked: - Atmosphere is elegant but comfy, which is on par with their \"gourmet comfort food\" menu offering. - Busy. The place was bustling with all types of people not afraid to have a good time enjoying good food and good company.  - Single bathrooms, not communal, which seems to be the new thing.  - Open kitchen - \"Non-stop\" sparkling or still water for $1, which goes to charity at the end of the year. - Staff were totally laid back and seemed to like their job (rare)  What we didn't like: - Old-style furniture. The tables were cool, but the chairs were right out of my great aunts bridge game room - wooden with flat, brown cushions that brought on numbness before the second dish. - Slow food service. Not sure if it's because they're still finding they're way, and I get the whole \"enjoy your meal\" thing, but it seemed slow."}
{"text":"They have a jazz brunch one sunday of every month and it was cool to listen to live jazz music - haha the first time I was there the jazz singer came up to me and it turns out that we went to jr high together! :) small world.  Great idea... jazz brunch!  Then I tried dinner and I actually quite enjoyed it. Everything we ordered was good, no mistakes made, and the porchetta portion was HUGE! Left full and satisfied. Service was great.  Would recommend for dinner.  We couldn't even make reservations, ended up coming at 5pm to get a table. They were BUSY right from the get go. So make reservations or come early!"}
{"text":"Have had lunch a few times here and really enjoyed it!  Stilton cheesecake was dense but light and I've had the house roast chicken, fries and the burger. All were tasty and I can't wait to return for the dinner selections.    Parking isn't easy to find and the decor is simple dark wood with a cozy feel and relaxed feel.  Pricing is comparable with the quality of the food you're receiving. Nothing pretentious or over the top which is a reflection of the owner...just down to earth yumminess served simply.  Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the most professional and knowledgable staff of any restaurant I've visited. I am celiac and so was our waitress, she was very knowledgable about what menu items were safe and also recommended menu items I never would have thought to be celiac friendly! She was very accommodating to our family, helping with coats and even getting glasses that were forgotten in a pocket! The food is absolutely amazing, very well cooked and seasoned. I have never been disappointed visiting NOtaBLE!"}
{"text":"HAPPY CHICKEN is what we eat all through the week... And when we are very lucky, we sit at the bar and watch the roasting chickens (and other goodies) at the wood-fired grill!"}
{"text":"The name says it all - we had troubles being seated, two more neighbouring groups had troubles being seated... something needs to be fixed in that department.  Eleven or twelve bucks for a glass of cute wine? Ok, but not when I can buy a bottle of this in a nearby liquor store for the same price. By the way, tempranillo is considered to be a cheapish grape in Spain - though it is way more developed in South America. NOtaBLE was carrying a Spanish version.  Twenty bucks for two medium pieces of chicken and a side? I'm paying that, but those should be majestic, a work of art. In NOtaBLE, they are just good. Check out RD BBQ in Brampton, guys - you can get a bigger portion of chicken twice cheaper... and cooked with love and desire to do something great out of something simple.  The soup was very good, by the way - best part of our meals. Fries were all smallish bits and pieces - yummy though. Salsa and catchup were a Real Canadian Superstore grade. Burger looked and smelled good, but my wife had a stomach pain later in the evening - not sure if that was the cause.  Our server was working just great - she was friendly, positive, helpful and fast. Way faster than the kitchen (something like fifteen minutes wait for the two lunch menu plates when the room is more than half empty? Guys...) NOtaBLE is one of those places where 18% tip comes pre-configured, by the way.  Decor was really nice, though a view from the window was just a side street \"el cheapo\" businesses - again, bold statement and limited execution.  I am feeling a bit sorry about the owner of this restaurant - looks like he really tried his best to deliver an impressive experience, but fall short in everything but the menu pricing."}
{"text":"The mussels and prime rib eggs Benny was on point.  Ask for their hot chocolate as well.  It's got a nice kick to it"}
{"text":"Food here is great, I've had several different dishes and all were excellent. Customer Service has also been top notch on every occasion. Parking can be a bit tough. There is an underground parkade accessible through the back alley, but if you drive an SUV or bigger vehicle, you'll likely need to park on the street and that is in short supply.  Tip: If you're having lunch here during the week, make a reservation to avoid disappointment"}
{"text":"Every time we have eaten at this restaurant the meals have been delicious, the service has been excellent and I leave looking forward to our next meal here. I'm a celiac and Notable has taken the time to do the research as to what we can eat and what we cannot. They have created a large number of recipes so that we too can enjoy. It is a pleasure to have appetizers, main courses and desserts that are available and most tasty to this very large segment of the population"}
{"text":"The food was incredible the service second to none, the experience was the best I have ever had in Calgary"}
{"text":"I booked in advance and they booked me at their sister restaurant The Nash instead which I had to book myself back into Notable and play phone tag. After eating at The Nash I had high expectations. I mentioned that it was a friend's birthday and was hoping to make it a great experience at Notable.   The one thing I can say about the environment is smokey. I am not sure if there is something going on with their ventilation but if you have asthma probably avoid this place. I got home smelling like a camp fire roast. I found myself often reaching for water to kill an oncoming cough. You could see a haze of it in there which was a bit amusing.   The food took forever to arrive and we were told it was because there was a big group there. I can say that the food was pretty decent but didn't have that wow factor I was expecting. Better than most but not spectacular like their sister restaurant. My carrots were so undercooked in part I struggled to get my fork in them. I mean I totally appreciate fresh but maybe at least cook them enough to get a fork into?   The staff was quite friendly and somewhat on the ball hostess aside. There wasn't a moment when water was going close to empty or wine wasn't offered.  If I had an impression of this place it would that it's living off past performance and dropped the ball a bit. If I was to go back it would probably for a casual lunch or something. It's definitely not a place I would bring someone for business or anything formal."}
{"text":"Great place!  Prime rib and chicken are primo!  Love the atmosphere.  You may have to wait for a table but it's worth it.  Come for weekday lunch.  Same great food no wait!"}
{"text":"Always excellent. My wife and have made this a favourite spot. Notable staff are always friendly and helpful. The food is amazing. We have new things every time with the same level of great taste and presentation. The desserts are exquisite. A must have is the salted Carmel over dark chocolate pudding."}
{"text":"During my first visit last night with friends, I tried the Ravioli taster (best ravioli ever eaten to date tied with Jacqueline Suzanne's Bistro) and the Rotisserie vegetable \"pizza.\"  Also extremely flavorful with unique ingredients and vegetables perfectly cooked for my taste.  I sampled my spouse's order of Dungeness crab and shrimp bake, which was good, hearty and sizable.  I had the delicious feature cocktail which tasted somewhat like a creamsicle (don't remember the name).  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was high energy.  It was pretty loud though and I smelled like restaurant afterward, likely due to the open kitchen concept.    What chaps my butt is the automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 7 or more, which of course applied to our larger group last night.  I strongly dislike restaurant owners with entitlement regarding this matter.  We actually were charged nearly 19% gratuity and my spouse pointed this out to our server.  She noted that this may be an error and would mention it to the management, but it did not in fact influence how our bill was handled.  We still had to pay the 18.9% gratuity.  It also bothers me when the charges are not separated for individuals in a large party.  This adds to confusion regarding paying the establishment and people end up leaving a little frustrated and/or disappointed.  Situations like this can have the power to deflate the mood at the end of the night, which truly is unfortunate and totally preventable from a business owner/management perspective.  I mention this because we struggled and the server intervened to help sort it out.  I felt it was awkward and the server appeared a bit sheepish when all was said and done.    I would not return to Notable with a large party.  Stick to a small group and you'll be good to go."}
{"text":"It's so awesome to have a great restaurant in the neighbourhood.  They are very busy! It's really hard to get a table at peak times so it's always best to book a reservation. The grill smells great and I love sitting near it to watch all the kitchen action. The food and the vibe are upscale casual and they do a nice job switching up the menu to keep things tasty and exciting."}
{"text":"I sure didn't like Catch, but I love NOtaBLE - good job Chef Michael Noble!  It is clearly one of Calgary's best restaurants to come along in a long time.  It seems like there have been a lot of new restaurants in town lately, but they are often big on flash and low on taste.  NOtaBLE hits the mark on both counts. In a truly hip building in a surprising location (in Bowness - seriously, I'm not kidding!), it is clear that NOtaBLE has the potential of becoming one of those iconic Calgary restaurants that you bring friends from out of town to (and there really aren't many of those out there!)   NOtaBLE describes itself as having gourmet comfort food - which is a very apropos description.  The decor is urbane, comfortable, and modern -- yet still homey and down to earth.  The \"ambo\" is perfect for either that ultra-romantic first date; a night out without the kids; or even a meal with friends you want to impress with your culinary IQ - and it's hard to nail all of these moods in one shot!  Looking around the tables when we were there, there was everything from good looking yuppies, affluent-looking seniors, young hipsters - and again, several couples on dates.  (Side note:  to the pretty blonde girl sitting beside us on the date with the hairy-chested guy who took a call on his cellphone for a half-hour while leaving you sitting there by yourself - drop the jerk, he's not worth your time!)  Anyway, food is amazing.  In my book, the mark of a truly excellent restaurant is doing the simple dishes very well. Although it was hard to decide given the menu that is filled with the usual tried-and-true favourites as well as some creative dishes, I had the Wood-grilled Organic Spring Salmon with risotto (I was tired of Stampede food by then), and it was truly perfect in all respects.  Wine list was comprehensive, and the server was knowledgeable.  For dessert, I had possibly the funnest dessert I have had in a haute cuisine restaurant in a long time - \"Mini Donuts with Creamsicle\" (actually, it was a frozen orange panacotta with vanilla mini-donuts) - whimsical, surprising, and delicious!  I can't wait to go back to NOtaBLE and try other things on the menu!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"We were regulars here for quite some time... note the WERE in that first sentence.  We arrived there at 11:15 this morning, only 15 minutes after they opened.  We were told by the hostess that it would be an hour wait.  There were several empty tables in the restaurant, but we were told that we couldn't sit in them because the kitchen couldn't handle how busy they were already,  and that if we wanted to wait for a table, we would have to stand at the door for the hour.    When we asked the manager on duty if we could at least SIT and have a beverage we were told very rudely that we couldn't.   This place has been slipping for some time now.  Even the menu isn't as good as it was.   We definitely won't be going back... we eat at a lot of higher-end restaurants and have never been so offended at the service."}
{"text":"I had heard many great reviews about NOtaBLE so we booked a table for my moms birthday. We had the tartar for an appetizer and it was presently uniquely and tasted great. We had the prime rib which was very fatty, but that's just how prime rib is sometimes. It was very tender, came out as requested and  tasted lovely! We also had the rib eye steak, and the bison flank. Both of which were succulent and had desirable accompaniments. We had requested salt from our server who unfortunately forgot and had to be reminded. They do not have salt on the table there as their dishes truly don't need it, but when requested it should be promptly fetched as that person is usually waiting to eat it with their meal. The dessert menu didn't have anything appealing to us on it so we wrapped it up after our meals. Our bottle of wine was great, but the server was never around to top up our glasses so we had to do it ourselves. It was good, maybe even great, but I wouldn't call it excellent."}
{"text":"October 22nd:   I returned back to Notable with a group of ladies for a \"Yummy Mummy's Dinner\" and had a blast.  I had reserved a table for 8 guests and were given a beautiful harvest table which allowed seating up to 12 guests.  (Note: If you reserve this table, they take a $100 deposit and place on a gift card which can be used for your upcoming meal.)  I recommended Notable as I love their seasonal menu and we had guests who had gluten allergies and were vegetarian.  I'm happy that there was enough variety and selection for everyone!    We were surprised with complimentary sparkling wine which we enjoyed.  Unfortunately the coconut syrup was not available for the Strawberry O cocktails but the server recommended the Lavender Lemonade which was delightful.  Other ladies had glasses of wine which were thoroughly enjoyed.  A few of us started with appetizers: crispy potato rolls (my ultimate fav!), chopped salad and the crab and shrimp bake.  A salmon tartar accidentally came to our table as well and we were graciously surprised when the server returned and gave it to us as a complimentary appetizer!  All of the appetizers were TASTY!!  A variety of main entrees were ordered which everyone LOVED. I love the portion sizes here as I always leave feeling full and enough for tomorrow's lunch thanks to the leftovers. Main entrees included:  the seasonal burger, salmon, cod, ravioli and rice bowl.  All of us loved the flavours of our meals and were satisfied with the large portions.  Despite being stuffed from our appetizers and main meals, we had to indulge in their delightful dessert menu.  My ultimate favourite will always be the chocolate pudding.  (Note: Please don't ever change or remove this item or I will be very sad!)  We also enjoyed the creme brulee which was a maple syrup flavour.  I love that they change this up as last time I believe it was a coffee flavour.  I recommend this restaurant for groups as well as for families.  They don't have a kids menu per se but have options for the little ones to enjoy as their menu is quite flexible.  I also do enjoy that they have a change table in their bathroom (For both Mom and Dad!) and that they have high chairs for little ones to use.    All in all, Notable did not disappoint.  I can always count on bringing guests here and all of us leaving with smiles and full stomachs.  I will be back ... soon!  Very soon!"}
{"text":"Unusual place for this kind of trendy restaurant... Across the street from a sketch strip mall kind of ruins ambience if you sit up front... Parking situation kinda sucks too... Otherwise interior is nicely designed with an open kitchen which you cam sit by.  Ventilation needs attention- got super hot towards the end of service. Food was nicely prepared and delicious.  Had the special dessert- fried spicy chocolate ice cream was tasty as was the flourless brownie.  The cherry cola float was meh...  The cherry cola was too cherry and barely cola, and when not done right, gets that cherry cough syrup taste that this had, unfortunately. I don't like the overly friendly server thing, which this server was.  It was a weird service- they were very attentive while at out table, but then disappeared for long periods when a check-up would have been nice... I.e. during appetizers, and they didn't check near the beginning of the main course at all. They charge for this snobby filtered water... I'm fine with the safety and taste of Calgary tap water, i don't think this was ever a choice. So a great meal, with some nitpicky things but enough to drop a star for this kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went based on the reviews on Yelp.   The crowd was older than we anticipated. Essentially an over 30 crowd which suited us just fine.  It was very busy for an early Wednesday night. We had to wait 15 minutes and ended up sitting in the bar area. Reservations are a must for this popular spot.   The ambiance is very energetic which we quite liked. It is a happening place with an open kitchen. The kitchen lights were a bit bright for my eyes.  The food was excellent. We quite enjoyed the scallops appetizer and absolutely loved the Stilton cheesecake. My lamb shank was great too.   The service was good right up until we wanted our bill. We had to ask the hostess to find our server. This was a real let down and unfortunately is the last impression we had of NOtaBLE. We ordered our desert and had no coffee. Why wouldn't you bring us the bill right after the desert?   Service can definitely be improved here, but we will return for the food and abiance and give it another try."}
{"text":"For such a trendy restaurant, its location was a little strange. Nonetheless, they make up for it with the amazing menu.  We were lucky enough to not have to wait for a table on a Saturday night, but that was probably because it was already 9:30pm. The menu was not extensive, but I guess they are taking the same approach as all the trendy restaurants today of having few dishes but doing the dishes extremely well. The menu also gets changed up every now and then, which is nice.  The decor was nice, contributing to the intimate ambiance. Our server was knowledgeable and courteous.  Overall, it is a beautiful place to have a great, rich meal in a small group."}
{"text":"Chef Michael Noble is a multiple gold and bronze medal winner for Team Canada in the world culinary Olympics, former head chef of Catch and the first Canadian ever to compete in Iron Chef JAPAN against Morimoto in Battle Potato.  NoTAble, his creation, takes weeks to get a reservation for dinner. Judging from brunch, it's worth it.  I've been to his resto in Bowness often since 2010, always with wickedly great  Phil and Sabastien coffee and mimosas. In one visit, my friend Shirley kept raving about the lychee martini (She kept raving on how subtle the lychee flavor was, and how refreshing it was).  The Sunday Brunch menu is filled with a familiar selection of farm fresh eggs and freshly smoked bacon, bennys and so on, but always with some sort of modern twist. For example, Chef Noble transformed the classic corned beef hash into a Salmon, sweet corn and pepper hash with potatoes ($14), or the simple crab cake became a dungeness crab and halibut cake ($19) and so on.   There's also the  NoTAble burger of the week.... this particular week was a Grade AAA Alberta beef and bison burger with smoked cheese and bacon, on a homemade baked sesame seed bun and freshly cut french fries ($16). and it was simply one of the best I've ever had period.  It's simply fantastic, but my only complaint time and time again.... the length of the service.  Honestly, this is an event meal, but definately not a quick pop in for a nosh.  3 hours...  that's how long it took for brunch.  And it's never been shorter.  But Chef Noble is a world class chef, and it's worth every bite. :)"}
{"text":"Really good!! Definitely nothing to complain! The grilled bread was delicious!! We ordered the 1/4 chicken with the daily soup and the chicken was great, but the soup was just amazing!! Very flavourful!! Just AWESOME! ... We also had the scallops and they were really good too! The grilled lettuce was delicious!... In addition, the service was very friendly and fast; and the prices were reasonable...   In summary, this place has 4 very solid stars!! I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the space is so tight in the dining room that you pretty much have to sit on lap of the strangers at the table beside you. They also have multiple single stall washrooms for \"men\" and \"women\" which I continue to fail to understand. It's a single stall washroom! Why not make it gender neutral like most progressive places these days? It's 2017!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite dishes is the brisket sandwich. Have been there a few times this year and it keeps arriving cold.   We sent it back the first time and it was remedied quickly but it can't always come to the table not warm.  Not sure what the problem is if the meat comes off the bbq. Soups are good but value is really lacking."}
{"text":"Oh lobster risotto and lamb burger. Cesar salad and carbonated water.  Highly Approve. really trendy, busy, tasty and food service can be seen from the open kitchen. Great first meal in Calgary."}
{"text":"Good view of the grill. The gravy was a bit salty on the fries. The burger is good but not special, the brisket was fatty but good. You will smell like smoke when you leave. Beware."}
{"text":"Sunday pm, quiet time, but food still fresh, hot, delicious. Started with a nice rich Mulligatawny. Neat idea with their water sales- filtered on site so less packaging & waste. Lovely cheese & smoked meat plate that the waitress described as kinda like a Ploughman's lunch - far better than any PL that I've ever had, here or in Britain. Dinner menu looks superb - will definitely be back with the boss when she arrives out here in Alberta."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, service. Excellent from the ground up loved it. One of the best burgers I have ever had. Barely ate half and the other half was breakfast the next day. Beautiful kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at this restaurant. In fact, we love the place so much we are more than just regulars. Call us evangelists.   Whenever someone asks us for a recommendation on the best restaurant experience in Calgary... guess who 'easily' comes to mind first: NOtaBLE.   Consistently, time and time again, we are met with amazing staff, fantastic management, and incredible cuisine.   The entire experience from entering the establishment, sitting down, ordering, watching meals being prepared in their open kitchen, sipping well-mixed drinks, eating gourmet cuisine, etc. is great. We walk away feeling extremely satisfied 100% of the time.   It is a classy happening place that allows you to be as casual or formal as you want. It does not matter because NOtaBLE is all about the service, the ambience, and the food.   Money and Time well spent!  *Big thanks to David, Josh, Mike, Jessica and Chefs Mike and Justin for always making it amazing."}
{"text":"Never before has my privacy felt so invaded when visiting a restaurant.  I know.  You read that opening line, you glanced back at the number of stars I am giving in this review, and now you're wondering how a five star review matches up with a sentence like that.  Let me explain.  I love food- NO! ... I'm OBSESSED with food. There are aspects of food and of the food industry that really resonate with me. Flavours, styles, presentations that hit at a level of my own personal taste.  With NOtaBLE, it's like Chef Noble read my mind. It's like he knew everything about my favorite styles of food and what I love about the restaurant experience, took that knowledge and formed it out of thin air into a fully functioning restaurant ... just ... for ... me.  I know that sounds delusional and psychotic, but really, everything from the restaurant decor, to the casual professionalism of the staff, to the calm order of the open kitchen, to the design and description of dishes, to the pricing of the meals, to the quality of ingredients, to the level of execution ... is all flawless.  Really, I wouldn't change A THING.  So naturally, when I walked in, looked at a menu, was served and ate, I couldn't help feeling a little violated that someone had entered my head, made off with my most comforting thoughts of food and turned them into a business.  The main dish I had was the mussels & frites in Thai coconut broth.  For weeks before visiting NOtaBLE, I had been inexplicably obsessed with this thought of mussels and fries with Thai coconut broth, and sure enough, there it was on the menu when I arrived. I am fully convinced that Chef Noble must have planted an Inception in my dreams.  It wouldn't be the first time, either, that Chef Noble was known for pulling food out of dreamland. Rumor has it that this is how the \"Stilton cheesecake\" on the menu was born. I wish I would have tried it, but alas, my attention was instead diverted to the warm dark chocolate pudding with salted caramel Village ice cream, which was beyond divine (sorry, Lord).  But I'm not too worried. I'll simply try it next time. Because there will ALWAYS be a next time."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in all of Calgary. You can go all fine dining or, get a burger. Consistently excellent food. We go here anytime it's date night. Can't recommend enough"}
{"text":"Had the burger and pork chop. Burger was stacked too high to enjoy and burgers should not be spicy like Thai food - too spicy and make it so people can put it in their mouth. The pork chop was more like a pork belly - more fat than meat. The pork chop, or pork belly, was cooked unevenly - raw in areas and well done in areas. The only good thing - good company and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant was 100% \"NOtaBLE\" in my books - but if you don't have a reservation you might end up with \"NO-taBLE\"...  OK..that was pretty cheesy. Let's move on.  Tucked away in the quietest area of Bowness available (and finally found after the GPS put us 5k off course??), this place was hopping at 9pm Saturday night. We entered to find that amidst this quiet street with nothing open - this restaurant was jam packed and loud and fun and smelled good. We had resos for 9pm and were seated shortly after arriving by a super friendly hostess (of which there appeared to be four of them). Our waiter (Mr. Darren G) quickly arrived to offer and explain about Q Water (of note: they charge 1.50$ and it goes to charity which is pretty cool). After ordering he arrived again with the water and then took the wine order. Their wine list is the perfect size of 30ish wines from 45$-250$.(translation: not 26 pages like some overstuffed local places). We had a Vega tempranillo which was delicious.  Soooo..what did we eat. We started with the potato rolls out of interest as we have never seen such a description..and they were amazing!! Six delicious little rolls (made from a thin potato slice), stuffed with yumminess, presented very Iron Chef style (the chef is Canada's first Iron Chef) and served with a spicy ranch and jalapeno salsa dips. So good and UNIQUE.! For mains we chose the rabbit confit ravioli (available as an appy or main) and the halibut. My normal staple is chicken but they were sold out - which was too bad, as their \"rotisserie of the day\" was chicken...but it was 930pm on a Saturday after all...The ravioli was really amazing. The fresh homemade pasta was so delicate and not \"heavy\", there was no drowning in too much heavy sauce and the filling was a perfect mix of minced rabbit and Boursin cheese (can't really go wrong). It was a great pasta. I had the halibut (eating fish in restaurants is new to me as I'm too lazy to make it at home and am taking the opportunity) and a great choice I made. The fillet was sizeable and cooked soooo goood. Topped with a sundried tomato and olive tapenade for punch and color, served with the freshest and crunchiest green beans ever and a chunky puree of fava beans,which to my surprise was a perfect complement to the fish and the flavored topping. It also came with golden beets which makes my hearts happy to eat:)  Having decided that we could definitely eat two desserts (not sure who were trying to kid), we chose the lemon crème brulee and the chocolate \"Beast\". Hmmm..if I could pick a fav it was the chocolate flourless cake with cherry compote and chocolate sorbet..only because the cake was like a piece of fudge...however, the lemon crème brulee was pretty outstanding (another translation: I could have eaten a vat of it).   I was pleased as punch: NOtaBLE you won this round hands down!  The server was great. Darren came by very often, was chatty and humorous, knew his menu, refilled wine and water a lot, and checked up on everything. He was pretty awesome. The atmosphere is like that of other new restaurants that have been pleasingly opening in Calgary...open kitchen with eating bar to watch, loud (but fun and engaging) atmosphere, dark and quaint, but busy and bustling with a pretty simple and elegant decor..I love an open kitchen..The price points were actually a little less than others as well -which was surprising to see making the meal WELL WORTH the money. Their menu took pride in using local, organic and sustainable foods which is a big movement in Calgary right now and made me happy to read.  No lies - this place was quite notable and I will surely be back often..hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I had buffalo steak - tender, not gamy at all and good red wine reduction sauce.  I also tried their lamb leg but wasn't my thing.  It was not gamy but too heavy with the sauce (felt quite heavr) and something missing.  I loved the glazed carrot (sweet) and other vege sides and potato was done perfectly.  They are supposed to be famous for their blue cheese cheese cake - it wasn't my thing but I don't like blue cheese.  But I could see why someone would love it.  I will come back again for their buffalo steak.  Good service.  A bit hard to find street parking but ok."}
{"text":"Took Jackie for our first date night in a long while. We started with the Shrimp and scallop bake. It was nice and creamy, with the right amount of salty. Good way to start off the meal. Neither of us are big wine enthusiasts, so we settled with cocktails. Hers was the 'Strawberry-O', mine the 'Rye-rebellion'. Both were good. Hers wasn't overly sweet, and mine was perfect, just the right amount of orange to offset the harshness of the rye (I'm new to rye). For our meals, we both ordered off the 'Inspired menu' and picked the same dish - Notable spaghetti carbonara with house made mesquite bacon. After the first bite I was floored. One of the dishes that I'll be thinking about often in the coming days. Lastly, we ended with desert. I chose the Coffee creme brûlée, and Jackie went with the warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel gelato. Hers I found too sweet, but she was loving every bite, mine was exceptional, although I found it to be very rich, went great with a cup of their Fratello French press coffee.    My one critique, and had nothing to do with the food, was they kept the restaurant real cool, so bring a long a sweater. The staff were friendly and helpful, and no issues with finding parking. Overall, a very enjoyable date night. Looking forward to visiting notable again in the near future. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The fantastic food here is matched only by the amazing service. This is a true gem located on the outskirts of Bowness. This is a one of a kind dining experience."}
{"text":"My Fiancé wanted to take me here for dinner after he popped the question, but was unable to get a reservation since they only book half the restaurant and the rest is first come first serve. So we went to Brava Bistro instead.  Determined to eat here, we decided to go here for my birthday dinner the following week, again could not get a reservation, so we decided to wing it. Luck was on our side as we walked up, and asked for a table for 2, we were immediately sat along the grill station.  I watched those chefs season so much meat and fish!  To not duplicate some of the great things that have been said in the other 56 reviews of NOtaBLE, here is a brief breakdown of highs and lows.  Highs: Lamb burger Cocktails Thai chicken wings Tuna and Avocado Tartar STILTON CHEESECAKE STILTON CHEESECAKE STILTON CHEESECAKE  Lows: So busy the servers are losing their minds, was given dirty side plate, never replaced, forgot to bring other things we asked for. Fries Noise level equals very high  All in all tasty food, tasty drinks, I like his menu, just not his fries."}
