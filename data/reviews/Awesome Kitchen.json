{"text":"My review is based on late night visits. Decent local pizza joint that has your basic slices (pep, Hawaiian, vegetarian) and then a couple Indian twists: Tandoori slice and Donair Slice (ask for sauce) and both of these are delicious. Always hot and ready slices, whole pizzas are available too.  The guy who works here is a nice, he likes to joke around with clientele.  Love the graffiti and sticker bombs inside the place (which is standing room only). Great late-night/after bar food, don't expect anything else."}
{"text":"If you want a huge slab of nasty pizza at 3 AM, this place has you covered. Unique toppings like tandoori chicken are available. The owner's theatrical flourish makes for some entertainment while waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place never fails to entertain me. after a particularly boozy night out with the girls, we went and hit up Awesome kitchen, only to find it packed and full of other drunkards. It was like being at a really crowded frat party except with brighter lights. I saw, within 20 minutes of lining up;  two fights, was grabbed by a stranger,  a lot of shoving, and watching a girl throw up on teh sidewalk, we had our pizza. It was worth it. Oh the best part was when we asked what kind of pizza was being prepared the owner says, 'pepperoni, donair, two fuc**ng veggie ...and a god*amn hawaiian'. Sigh, this place is the best."}
{"text":"A late night pizza slice joint apparently run as a one man show. You may need to wait a while for a slice if it's busy, but the pizza will definitely be fresh. Prices aren't bad. Offerings are halal, and interesting topping options are tandoori chicken and donair. Be sure to ask for the sweet sauce if you get the latter! Hot sauce is available on the counter to spice up your pizza...also highly recommended."}
{"text":"Favourite Late Night Pizza. The Chicken Tandoori Pizza.. The Donair Pizza.. The Veggie Pizza. Ali and friend makes good pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The pizza is slightly greasy, super tasty. Sauce has a hint of sweetness in it and the crust is crisp like good pastry. His ready to eat slices are actually better than the take home whole pizzas because the cardboard box changes the crust."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was in my teens but I haven't been there in who knows how long. After Angelo and I had our great adventure for the evening hanging out with Sabz & Co. we decided to partake in a slice of pizza.

We decided to see if Awesome Kitchen was open and almost after leaving Angelo hollered at me to come back and so we went inside this hole in the wall pizza joint met by a bizzare variety of individuals.

Let me tell you, this dude that works inside there I will call him the Pizza Nazi. He is basically like Sukiyaki's (The CORE) Noodle Soup Nazi. He's going to yell at you and ask you what you want. When you pay him he's gonna throw your change at you so be ready or it'll be on the floor. Once you've ordered STFU and just wait for your pizza to come cause if you're talking to him while he's talking to someone else he's going to give you the HAND.

We had the Tandoori Chicken Pizza, it was mad delicious, nice and tangy and honestly just seeing the characters inside there make it all worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pizza place to go! Back when I lived in Calgary I would come here all the time and it never disappointed. I love all the different flavours, however the Donair Pizza with the garlic sauce on the side is my personal fav. The owner has always been super nice and only serves the freshest pizzas. Coming in from LA and it's definitely going to be crossed off my cravings list! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Donair Pizza. Tandori Pizza. I'm almost tempted to learn how to play the guitar, put on a ridiculous mascot outfit and stand on a street corner flagging people to come and visit Awesome Kitchen. Since my last review I've been reunited with this post-drinking hallowed ground and I realized something...Ali's pizza is REAAAAALLLY GOOD. Yes, that means I've been eating Awesome Kitchen Pizza SOBER.

I hope the prices stay because at the end of the night, you need to find a place to get rid of all that loose change in your pocket. Also if they invented mouth band-aids I'm sure I'll be coming here much more often."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! You have to try the tandoori chicken pizza and Donair pizza.... The tandoori chicken pizza sounds gross but is highly addictive. Also there pepperoni and Hawaiian are amazing too. Well worth the 15min line up most weekend nights!"}
{"text":"This is a great post-bar pizza place. It was busy when we walked in but the guy had us through in no time. The pizza was HOT. We had to wait a little to let it cool before we could eat. They have some different selections from your regular pizza place too. They had the basic pepperoni and hawaiian, but to add to that there was donair and tandori chicken slices.

I don't know how the lone guy keeps up with serving customers and making pizzas, but he did a wicked job last night.

Side note: There's a couple of stools, but really it's a grab and go."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave Awesome Kitchen (which truly IS an awesome kitchen!) 4 and not 5 stars is that the gentleman working told me the debit was down, but I think he was just making it up.
The chicken tandoori pizza is to DIE for, seasoned perfectly with sweat and tandoori paste. The vegetarian is forgettable, but the donair is great: tastes different every time you go! Almost as if he collects the scraps from varies donair spots at the end of each night when they close down.
Reminds me of dinners at my dad's house. Lots of colourful language, he invites young girls in to help him serve for free pizza, and he even flips pizza slices in the air just like my dad! A true Italian experience.

Make sure you ask for debit every time, and let me know when it's back up and running!"}
{"text":"I almost spit out my beer laughing when Yelp asked me if this place was \"Good for Kids\".

Answer: A resounding NO. Don't take your kids within 5 miles of this place on a weekend night.

This place is good for one thing and one thing only: Eating something cheap when you've had a few to drink. The fact that this place opens somewhere around 11:00 (I can never quite remember when exactly) should tell you everything you need to know.

The hallowed halls of Awesome Kitchen are adorned with graffiti. A television in the corner blasts the latest in east indian pop jams, which, when you're drunk suddenly make a world of sense. 

The owner, Ali, is a legend in the Belt Line. Everyone who spends any time down there has some sort of story about him.

Does he really sleep in the back on a hammock? (Answer: yes!)

Will he really give you a free slice of pizza in exchange for flashing him your boobs?  (Answer: Inconclusive, but all signs point to yes.)

Does he really yell at you if you ask for donair sauce on anything but the donair pizza? (Answer: Abso-friggin-lutely).

I've had more strange run-ins and bizarre encounters in this tiny pizza place than I have anywhere else in the area. I had a giant white-guy with a serious racial crisis address me with a racial slur and tell me he appreciated my shaved head - then rub it.

I've had an incredibly intoxicated female approach me and tell me she used to come watch that band I was in 5 years ago and plant a kiss on my cheek \"For the memories.\"

I've feared for my life while fights broke out in the pizza line and I've laughed as drunken customers vomited on everything from the counter to themselves.

I've burned my mouth roughly 50 times, accidentally dumped half of a bottle of hot sauce on my pizza and inexplicably left a tip for the absolute ZERO amount of work completed by handing me a slice that was sitting in the heating chamber.

But for what it is, this place can't be beat. Hot, cheap pizza in the moment you're convinced you need it the most.

You never know who you'll meet when you stop in, but you do know one thing: Don't ask for donair sauce unless you've got a donair pizza, or you're in for a serious earful.

Pizza I'd recommend (In this order):

Donair Pizza 
Hawaiian
Tandoori Chicken

{"text":"Pizza is quite greasy.  Only good after late nights drinking when taste goes out the window for hot and fast.  There have been a couple of times I go and they are closed even when the store hours says they should be open."}
{"text":"This place is definitely alive and vibrant at night. We tried the donair and the chicken tandoori pizza. The crust is a thicker crust and a bit greasy (make sure you get napkins!). I probably wouldn't order this to take home and eat, but not bad for post drinks and late night."}
