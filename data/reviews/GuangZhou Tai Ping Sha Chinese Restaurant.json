The noodle craze continues as another joint opened up recently at Peachtree Plaza right by Big Beef Bowl. This restaurant is a popular chain that originated in Guangzhou which specializes in beef brisket and tendon noodles.

The beef brisket was tender and flavourful but the broth itself was on the milder side. The consistency of the soup was a bit starchy which may be from the rice noodles. Nothing too special to speak of in terms of the noodles itself except portions of it were clumped together."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch, decor is all over the place not sure what was going on with the gold insert under the table. It's pretty darn ugly. Wanted to try their ox tail but was told they don't have. Also some menu item at covered with a piece of paper. Petty sad for a grand opening and to not have all your menu item ready. Shouldn't be on the menu in the first place. 
I got the beef brisket and pig intestine, didn't ask if I wanted rice noodle or egg noodle, default is rice noodle. Noodle portion is big but I did notice that the rice noodles are all cut to different size some are still stuck together.... there wasn't a lot of protein compare to the amount of noodles I had. 
Service wise okay except for one of the waiter which is probably the boss because he got a text message and took his phone out in front of me to check while I was still ordering."}
{"text":"small portion, expensive.
 Came here with high expectation since this is a well known chain from Guangzhou. But the food quality cannot compare to its locations in Guangzhou. 
I ordered Mixed Beef rice noodle. The soup was tasteless, only few pieces of beef flowed on top the noodle. It is not the authentic taste from Guangzhou. 

Only good thing about this restaurant is their chilly sauce. This is it...my last visit ever."}
{"text":"A local favourite in Guangzhou, I had to give this place a try. The brisket of a cow is one of the best cuts to eat (asides from the different cuts of steaks) being very tender and soft when done right and so it was my mission to try their beef brisket here. 

Commonly, there are two takes on beef brisket in the Cantonese cuisine with one being braised in a rich sauce/marinade (here) and a clear sweet broth. Here they are famous for the braised one where the brisket is cooked for hours til it's tender and soft. 

I ordered two dishes to try which were the brisket lo mien and ngau jap (mixture of beef internals). Flavor was similar to what you would get in Guangzhou (according to my tongues memory) but the portion size was a turnoff. Small dish of beef internals going for $10+ as well as only a few pieces of brisket for the lo mien. The flavor is there but the price is way to steep for the amount you're getting. This place is not bad as a one time thing for the flavor but other than that, don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my hubby today because he has great memories from the original store, in his home town of Guangzhou.  We walked in and sat down at a table. The waiter was very friendly, brought us our menus and 2 cups of lukewarm lemon water. I looked at my menu and couldn't see the item that I wanted. But that's because the 2 menus that they brought were different. This place is famous for their beef brisket/tendon rice noodles but I chose noodles instead. My hubby ordered pork Intestine Rice Noodles and we ordered a side of radish & beef Intestines.  The Intestines & radish came first, the beef stomach and radish were both too soft. The flavour was very peppery and gingery, not to my liking. Next came a bowl of beef brisket rice noodles, it was a wrong order. We informed the staff and they took it away. My soup noodles came next. The amount of noodle was fine, however the protein was only 4 pieces with spring onions. Beef Brisket and tendons were a good flavour and texture. My hubby's bowl didn't arrive so we asked about it. In total we asked 4 times, I'd already finished my bowl by then and I'm a slow eater. My hubby's bowl came in the end and was a big letdown, the pork colons were much too soft. The chilli oil is famous here as well, apparently, but it's not to my liking. It's got a lot of ginger in it and is spicy but not at all fragrant.
It's not somewhere that I would have gone myself, having not known about it's specialities or history. But my hubby was disappointed and I didn't really think the food was outstanding. 
The service is very good here, and they apologised a few times for my hubby's wrong/late order and even gave us 10% off our bill. Ok place to go for a bowl of noodles but not somewhere I'm dying to return to and not a patch on the original (according to my hubby)."}
{"text":"The noodles here are absolutely amazing. I don't say that lightly. Toronto has been blessed with an abundance of ethnic Chinese cuisine in the last few years and noodles have been a large portion of these new establishments. I'm a huge fan of this as it means more variety and competition. My wife and I were excited to try this new beef noodle place but we came on a Sunday lunch time and people were huddled at the door bearing the cold, so we left. We came back on Thursday at 6:30pm and they had plenty of seats. We ordered the famous beef brisket with flat rice noodles, beef tendon flat rice with flat rice noodles, beef brisket rice noodle rolls and a plate of vegetables. Everything was fresh and tasty. The noodles were the smoothest and softest I've ever had. I thought the rice noodle rolls would be too much carbs and the same thing but the beef brisket sauce was sweeter and stronger in flavour. Next time I would like to try their famous beef Intestines and their other noodle option. Finally, their service was wonderful. Each server was kind enough to explain if we needed recommendations and was polite from beginning to end."}
{"text":"When I went a couple days ago with my family, everything they wanted was already sold out .. the portions are small and expensive for what you were getting. It was honestly not that special, Big Beef Noodle is better"}
{"text":"I usually don't write review for only one visit, unless the experience was extremely bad or extremely good... After I read the first review, I decide to write my review based on my one time visit to this restaurant two days ago.

They only open less than a week, and they are currently hiring mostly all the posts in the restaurant = short of staff.  Although they are short of staff, their staff are very friendly, and happy.

Menu is a bit mess up on English version... Chinese said it's Pork Intestine Noodle Soup, but in English is Beef Brisket Noodle Soup.  If you can't read Chinese, better confirm with their staff if it's a pork or beef before you order it.  They said they will fix the menu and reprint it in near future.

I ordered Beef Tendon Noodle Soup, and my husband ordered Beef Brisket Noodle Soup.

It is a standard Asian portion, which is a good fit for me... (but not for him...)

The beef broth looks quite dark, and it smells so good... after I have my first sip... OMG!!!  It is amazing!!!  This is authentic Cantonese Beef whatever* Noodle soup should taste like!!  (*whatever can mean tendon, brisket, tripe, etc.)  I feel like I'm back to Hong Kong, as it is easy to find this type of noodle soup in Hong Kong, but not in GTA!!

In Hong Kong, we usually order noodle soup plus some side dishes.  We can't order any side dishes as it is too late in the day.  The side dishes we want to order are sold out...

We decide to go back a couple weeks after, as their beef whatever noodle soup is tooo good.  And we really wish to try their small side dishes.   Hope that the restaurant will run smoother than before."}
{"text":"Came here twice and got slow inattentive service twice.  Portion: small.  Price: steep.  Food: below average"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for a Friday lunch.  We're greeted and seated promptly.  I ordered a beef briskets and pig intestines noodle soup.  It was yummy and authentic.  If you have never tried this particular type of noodle soup, please take a chance and figure out why it, as well as the blood jello variety, has survived years of food evolution.  The briskets were tendered and the intestines were fresh.  I agree with another reviewer that the broth was blander than normal.  It tasted bold once I had added the house chilli sauce.

Also, if you want to experience the ambiance of an old neighborhood noodle joint in Southern China, the decor here does the job.  Because it was the first thing that hit us in the face: the cloth under glass tabletop, the television, the wall color and decor, the tableware, the spice tray on the table.  It must be intentional."}
{"text":"Tried on the first day Grand opening I think, severely overpriced yet the portion is extremely small, and didn't taste pretty bad.

Size:
my husband and I ordered two different dishes at $7.99 each, then we pay $1.50 per dish extra for added noodle, when the noodle came, we questioned the waitress did they added the noodle cuz it's still very small, just like what u r getting from food court. Instead u r paying 7.99+1.50=9.50 for a food court sized dish.

Taste:
In terms of taste, my dish is overly sauced, the amount of sauce they put on my dish is almost like a soup, and the sauce has no other flavor except salty salty salty. I got the special rice noodle, and some of the noodle tasted dry, my husband said they must have taken it out from the fridge, instead freshly made.

So we spent like $25 getting something that's very small, we both gotta order something else elsewhere after we left this place, it's not just the size, it's the taste that's not there too. Wouldn't go back anymore."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience at this place. Their service is so slow. The food took 30 mins to reach us. I also had bad, upset stomach after eating here. I don't think the food is clean. Ordered a beef tendon and beef brisket. Took them 15 mins to tell us they sold out on the beef tendon and another 45 mins for the beef brisket to be served. Regretted trying this place out."}
{"text":"To be honest I am not ususally a big fan of brisket because it is really a hit or miss. When they first opened, I came with a friend and I was quite impressed at how tendered and well seasoned they were. It was well braised that I really wanted to bring my grandparents here as they like brisket but cant eat most of it due to their teeth. Today, it was very disappointing as the briskets were very hard and they cant eat it. I came back a few times before and I noticed their brisket progressively gets worse everytime
Their food are on the higher end for noodles. Brisket noodles for 7.99. 
The only thing that is really good is their chili oil. That is worth a try or even buy one for home."}
