{"text":"I'd like to give a better rating ,  however over the past ten years I've noticed a decline in the quality and experience in this place.  

They've really spruced up the interior and brand but while doing so,  they took away the \"history\" of removing the classic pacman/aliens arcade table game and discontinuing the Shamrock stamp card. 

The prices have skyrocketed and the quality has decreased in the product over the past few years (except the Shamrock Shakes) .  I feel that the only \"homemade burger\"  they have now is the Famous burger since the size and quality has been the only constant in their burger selection.  I still can say that the burgers are good,  but it used to be able to say that they were great.  

I remember as an early teenager coming here to a jammed packed place where the original staff/owners would be so friendly and inviting.  Now it's the total opposite. All the staff seem friendly,  but lack the guest interaction.

The manager/supervisor had to be the low in the whole experience. Seems like every time I've ordered she acts as if she hates her job by lack of personality and tone of voice when I ask for a combo. I feel bad for the staff because I can tell she brings them down. And for some reason two years ago, a cashier that was just hired there that I knew personally was told by that manager not to talk to guests,  even though I was the only person there at the time.  Kinda weird eh!? 

My only real highlite now in coming in is seeing my team picture on the wall by the entrance and remembering when they had us come in for free meals at the end of our season."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I just had to for this experience. Bought a steak on a kaiser today and it was probably the worst I've ever had, actually wanted to vomit midway through my meal. They charged me $11 for a steak on a kaiser with cheese. After everything was assembled, the cheese wasn't melted, and the sandwich as a whole was cold. Who wants cold, unmelted  shredded cheese in their mouth? That's disgusting. Service was mediocre, had to wait a bit. Quality of the steak was garbage, full of veins and was incredibly chewy even though I asked for a rare. This will be the last time I am ever coming to this location. I find it ridiculous that I was charged $11 for this nonsense."}
{"text":"Burgers are great and staff are awesome. Nice to finally have some options in North Ajax."}
{"text":"Food was very good but pretty expensive. Both times We came the staff was very dismissive and acted as if they were doing us a favour by taking our order. Won't return a third time simply due to the poor attitude of their staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Shamrock Burger last night for dinner, and I felt the need to write a review today.  This was our second trip to Shamrock, and both were enjoyable.

The place itself is bright and clean and fairly new and modern.  The staff were all quite friendly and helpful, and the cashier was very pleasant, explaining all of our options and choices.  She also pointed out that the burgers are now all homemade (I didn't know that they weren't before) which is nice.

Now, the food... I ordered the big 10oz burger because I was starving, and got an order of onion rings with it.  The burger patty was lightly seasoned, and did look hand made.  The big one (there are 3 choices... I think 4oz, 6oz, and 10oz, all of which can be ordered double-stacked) was a thick oval patty, which stuck two half moons out each side of the bun.  It was cooked well, and was juicy without being sloppy, and held together well.  The seasoning isn't my favourite, but it certainly wasn't bad at all (I can't say it reminded me of Lick's, but I haven't been there in a long time).  The cheese and toppings were what you'd expect - I ordered a pretty standard lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion with cheese (+$0.79 I think) and loved my burger.  It was a monster, too.  10oz is a big burger, but it was really good so I had no problem stuffing the last few bites in.  Oh, good fresh bun, too.  No problems at all with mine holding together.

The onion rings were a standout for me.  A good amount of really tasty batter, fried puffy and crispy golden brown, there wasn't a single soggy, floppy ring in my batch.  They weren't all-onion either, which some places like to do, starting with massive double-thick onion chunks.  These were the right size that an onion ring should be, at least in my mind.  And the container is large too, none of this \"put an order of onion rings in a small fries container\" business that I see in lots of places.  It was a good sized portion, which is good because they were delicious.

My wife got the small burger, which she was very happy with, and an order of poutine, which she liked a lot the last time we were there.  It was a hit again this time, and I dipped in for a few bites despite feeling ready to burst.  The gravy is good, not the tasteless generic stuff you get sometimes, and the cheese curds are large and plentiful.  The fries themselves might be a small weakness for me, but only because they weren't anything special.  They were still decent, just not as standout as the rings, and those will always be my go-to side here.

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, but in any case this is a great local burger joint for us, and I would rank them up there with the usual Toronto favourites like Apache.  It will probably come down to personal preference as to which one is your top burger, but Shamrock should at least be tried especially if you're in the east end of the city."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here with a friend and it was just ok. I ordered the classic rock burger which is a 4oz patty with your choice of 20+ toppings. I also got a side of onion rings, which were lacking flavour. I haven't written this place off because it's close to school and a pretty school spot for lunch. It is a fast food restaurant so I didn't expect it to be spectacular. However, I will probably be back."}
{"text":"They do not have pizza here, but they do serve up good burgers and best onion rings I have had in a long time. Service was good and price is affordable. Had the classic 10 oz burger and was hard to eat all of it. ."}
{"text":"This is a place I have been going to over 30 years. 
I stopped in tonight with a buddy and was told it was a 15-20 minute wait she was the only one there. That's fine its. Worth the wait. 

I have been in a situation like that before and if it was me I'd be....... any how she was a pro. Very polite efficient, since she was by herself..

She must have had a few extra onion rings, so she gave them to my friend and I for waiting, and they were the best onion rings I have ever had, and most times I don't like them, because people use frozen ones,  yuck. 

I know this place went done hill a few years back.  Started using frozen fries etc, and I left too. But rest easy,  remember. Fan of over 30 years, Shamrockburger is dishing out the goods again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the first time I really enjoyed it.  That was well over a year ago.  I just had it again over the weekend as I was craving for some onion rings but it left me quite disappointed.  It's a shame because the cook was very kind and the place is literally right around the corner from where I live so it would've been very convenient.  Not sure if it was just the cook or what but I'm really hoping that they'd improve. 

Classic Rock - The most basic burger they have with a single patty.  The patty this time around was bland and dry.  The burger itself was quite bland considering all the toppings added.  I've definitely had way better burgers for a fraction of the price.  2/5

Onion Rings - Came here specifically because I was craving onion rings and I was again disappointed.  The batter was incredibly thick that I honestly don't even know if I even got any onions.  Because the batter was thick, it was very greasy.  Onion rings shouldn't be THAT greasy.  I've had thicker rings with big rings of onions that weren't as greasy.  The amount of grease actually left me feeling a bit ill in the middle of the night.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're coming off a recent detox.  1/5"}
{"text":"Small and cute burger joint and there's a Pacman table for you to play while waiting! The burgers are delicious and they have the best onion rings I've had in a while. Service is good too. There's really nothing bad to say about this place, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"\"Shamrock Burgers has been serving up great Canadian food since 1970 Shamrock is parked in a very prominent place in Toronto History\" directly from the website... Not sure why they have been around that long.
Its average burgers with average prices, I have tried this place on several occasions and have never received a great meal. The owner/staff never really make you feel welcome, it is a bit of a let down.
The onion rings are big balls of doughy blandness, for the money you'd hope to get more than 5 but then again its a bit of a saving grace that you only get 5 dough balls to choke down.
fries have been over cooked on every visit.


Will not go back"}
{"text":"Their burgers are pretty good, although I don't like the spice mix they put in them (tastes very much like Licks).  I ate there when they had a Groupon deal and was happy with that price, but regular prices and too high I haven't  been tempted to go back without a coupon.  Very small inside with few tables, so better for take out than eat in."}
{"text":"Granted we were the last customers of the day, but they really didn't care about our food.  The burgers were burnt on one side and one of the patties were cut in half.  The lettuce on one was nothing but stems, and when she wrapped them, the sandwiches weren't covered but on one half so toppings had fallen out in the bag when we got them home.  The onion rings were good which was why they got 2 stars instead of 1.  I used to think this location was better than the Scarborough one, but I am not so sure now."}
{"text":"Good, quality burgers and fries that taste home made! For a few dollars more than Harvey's you can get a burger and fries or rings of much better taste and quality! This is our go-to burger joint!"}
{"text":"The canadiana burger was on point! The pulled pork was chunky and meaty..we did have a Groupon so that's why we ended up here..if you're looking for fresh beef patties..this might not meet your expectations though.."}
{"text":"Burgers are always fresh. Well seasoned. My only beef (pardon the pun) is the size of the burger buns. I order the Rockstar and the bun feels too big. Could use smaller buns (or I could order a bigger burger:). Great spot. Definitely try the onion rings. They're the same as when I ate at the original store in Scarborough as a kid!"}
{"text":"Tried Shamrock Burgers (Highland Creek) for the first time yesterday, for lunch. Onion rings were the star of the show.  Huge rings with a thick beer batter, different from most places, and they use very sweet onions.  

However, the burger did not impress. It had a spice mix that reminded me of Lick's, which is not a good thing.  If I wanted Lick's (I don't), I'd go there.  Very stingy with the toppings.  Barely enough lettuce to notice.  Bun did not hold together well at all and fell apart after just 3 bites into the burger.

We won't return unless we just want great onion rings."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with the wife & kids, since she was craving a burger, & I didn't feel like cooking.  A buddy on my hockey team had mentioned this place, so we decided to give them a shot.

The place is decorated in a hip, \"rock and roll\" style with graffiti on the walls, & while it wasn't filthy, it definitely wasn't clean, either.  The table our oldest boy picked out for us had crumbs & other assorted schmutz on it.  Seeing as how we were there at 4:30, well ahead of the dinner rush, there was no reason that one of the two girls working couldn't have cleaned the tables.

I went up to the counter & ordered a Famous Burger Combo (10oz) with onion rings for myself, while my wife wussed out & chose a Classic Burger Combo (4oz), despite me pressuring her to order a Rock Star Combo which comes with a 6oz burger.  She did however, choose to upgrade to sweet potato fries for an extra buck.  The kids wanted a chicken finger combo & a kids' burger combo, so after all was said & done, the damage was $36 & change.  Oh yeah, my wife tried to order a milkshake for us to split while we waited for our food, but the machine was broken.  Apparently, the machine is broken a lot, at least according to the counter girl.

We sat down & waited an appropriate amount of time for our food, unless you ask our 6 year-old, who was famished, & said it took \"forever.\"  Unfortunately, they forgot to give my wife the sweet potato fries she ordered, so we had to send the regular ones back while we waited for them to bring the sweet potato ones out to us.  It turned out to be very unfortunate that we sent those back, because when I tried my onion rings, they were a monumental disaster.  Like Greg B said in his review, these things are DOUGHY BLANDNESS!  Once you get through all that batter, there isn't even a hint of onion.  How can you hide the taste of onion in an onion ring?!!?  The batter is so thick, that they don't even look like onion rings!  They look like that unrecognisable lump of clay that a first-grader brings home as a Mother's Day present.  The only saving grace was that they don't charge you extra to upgrade(?) to the onion rings, like they do with the sweet potato fries.  If I had paid extra for those, I can't even imagine what obscenities would've erupted from me.

Now, terrible onion rings aside, the sweet potato fries were quite good, and the regular fries were decent enough.  Thankfully, they weren't overcooked, like Greg B's were.  The fries were medium cut, with the skin-on, & were comparable to New York Fries, just a little thicker.

My burger was fairly good, although it wasn't remarkable in any way.  It was cooked properly, still juicy enough to be enjoyable, but not so juicy that it turned into a soggy slopfest, either.  It was good enough that I'd come back, but not good enough that it'll be next week.

The combos come with fountain drinks, although canned pop is also available.  Even though you get free refills, my beef is that the cup they give you is the smallest one you'll ever see in a restaurant, & the soda fountain is behind the counter, so they have to refill it for you.  Most places let you fill your own cup.  Lucky for us, it wasn't busy, so we could walk right up to the counter for refills, but if it had been busy, getting refills would have been a major pain.  It would also be problematic for those weirdos who like to make \"swamp water.\"

All in all, I would normally have given them 3 stars, but for a burger place to have such unbelievably bad onion rings, just makes me angry, so 2 stars it is.  I might go back, but I definitely wouldn't order the onion rings again, unless at gunpoint."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  I have to wonder how their food was deemed to be one of the best burgers in Toronto.  The bun was fresh but way too much bread for a burger. I didn't find the list of toppings to stray too far from any other burger place.  I had the hand made onion rings.  Awful with way too much batter on the onions.  In a few rings the batter was three times the thickness of the onion.  The chocolate milkshake was decent but not epic like Mr. Greenjeans (a la Eaton's Center).  I left feeling very under whelmed especially given the price which is similar to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Shamrock Burger is an eastern Scarborough institution. It's one of those places where they serve fries which actually have potatoes in it, burgers which actually have meat in them. The food is pretty hearty, the people are usually pretty nice. It's fairly simple food, made well. Proving, sometimes simple is good."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burger place I've been to. Bun was cold, toppings were average - nothing special. Service was really good but I don't think I would come back"}
{"text":"Dropped by on our way home for a quick dinner. With all the hype of gourmet burgers and such, we thought we'd try out this place. The burger was flavourful and moist. Bun was toasted just right and that first bite definitely made you want another. The poutine is delicious! Lots of cheese, lots of gravy. The prices are higher than your typical fast food joint, for 2 burgers, 1 poutine, 1 fries and 2 small drinks - it came to $30!! They would have received a 4-star rating if it wasn't for the fact that the server yelled from the counter (with 4 customers still waiting for takeout orders) to tell us that we needed to leave because it was 8:32pm and they were closed and the other girl working the lobby had to mop - even though the sign on the front door said they close at 9pm!! It make any sense because we got there at 8...plenty of time to order and eat. My husband just told her that we will not be rushed to eat, we will leave when we're done."}
{"text":"I went on St.Patty's day for a free shamrock shake and got the famous burger. It surprised me! I really loved it!  (Mind you it put me in a bit of a coma for the next 24 hrs  but well worth it!) 

The onion rings (which so many people raved about) were not what I expected though, too doughy and greasy, I couldn't even finish more than 2 and that NEVER happened to me before with onion rings. 

Would definitely go back for more of their burgers!"}
{"text":"Shamrock was a bit disappointing.

On the plus side they offer free pop refills, friendly service, great fries and presentation

Unfortunately there were too many negatives...

- They removed the egg topping option.  They did by scratching it off the sign with a pen.
- Limited toppings
- Cool looking dinning room, but not very clean, run down
- The burger was ok, but it was over cooked, almost burned, and a funny after taste in the meat
- Bacon was also burned
- Ordered the 10 oz. burger, but it's shaped like a football so the meat sticks out of the bun.  What's the point of ordering a larger burner if it can't fit within the bun?
- Really bad onion rings, bad spongey coating

In the end I think Shamrock Burger fails because of bad management, won't be going back."}
{"text":"I live for better than average burgers, and Shamrock was a lucky find.  There are your \"mystery meat\" burgers like McD, A&W, and common burgers like 5 Guys, and Heroe's. I always prefer South Street, The Works, Burgers Priest and any other place with a tastier approach to the venerable meat puck. 

Shamrock has just a few different burger options (mostly in size), but add on a Steak Sammy, or a Philly Cheesesteak and I get interested. For a different flavour I went with the Philly Cheesesteak with the addition of sautéed mushrooms and the Chipotle BBQ sauce.  It's great that you can customize your meal. 

To round out the Combo, I had a generous portion of Sweet Potato Fries and a Garlic Mayo for the dip. My associate had the burger and attached a bunch of special requests. It all came out perfectly, and I didn't hear a peep out of him until he was finished hoovering down the whole thing. 

Really, for a couple bucks more than  McBurger there is no excuse for not enjoying good food, customized the way you want it!"}
{"text":"Outside Window Says \"Best Burgers in Toronto, what more do you need to know?\"

hmm let's see ..
1) Their store hours are all over the place - Website says 9:00pm, Door says 8:30, and the server inside says 8:00pm. I asked that the door says it closes at 8:30pm, she said \"Yeah, the manager decided to close early this week, because he thinks it won't do much business\", she also said, the thinks it's unfair but no in her hands.

2) Small \"ice cream\" shake is $4, couldn't taste any ice cream and the potion size was tiny.
You get double out of  a small ice shake in Work's or other burger joints.

3) Waiter also forgot to add napkin to my take out order. I was left eating a greasy burger in my car without napkins.

4) Taste - What I had was definitely not the best in Toronto. It wasn't bad, cooked and seasoned properly, but tasted mediocre. Maybe their signature burgers are better, but since they were closing, the couldn't make me any.

I emailed the owner regarding store hours, and he said the store hours would be followed from now and also offered me 2 combos.

However, this is my honest review on what I experienced last night, while I appreciate the owner reaching out to me, the store hours thing was just unacceptable. I saw other people turned away in front of me while the store should have served them."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great shakes, great onion rings but I won't go again.  The reason? Well their staff's customer service skills are so bad I actually had to wonder if they are trying to give bad service on purpose like it was a theme for the chain or something.  I've had bad service at the Ajax location but I would never give a whole chain a bad name for just a single worker who doesn't own the business but since this isn't the first time I've experienced it and I've heard the same from others I'm going to declare this place dead to me.   

Take a lesson from lush or any other place that is nice to its customers."}
{"text":"Shamrock has been an institution for decades. Their burgers were juicy and delish then and they're still today. Flame grilled, standard toppings, plain kaiser, well seasoned, onion rings and fries. Very small location. Maybe 6-8 seats. Friendly staff. Easy to read easy to select in confusing menu. Not too many options. In my opinion one of the best burgers in Toronto.

Last time I went they took out the PAC-Man game that was there for ever. Boo."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers. Whadda-ya-waaant?"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype at all. I've been dragged here by friends oodles of times over the last decade & every time I leave feeling gross. Food is just grease. I don't know why people eat here!"}
{"text":"Actually I was surprised by Shamrocks.  I have put off trying it for awhile just because I typically don't do fast food and it felt like a fast food restaurant.

The burger was tasty.  Thinner then expected but with the traditional options I was able to make a messy burger just the way I like it.  And I would eat it again.  A good measure.  The Philly cheese steak was good, however I was curious on where the cheese was.  More would have made it more traditional.  And would have mitigated the question - where is my cheese?

The homemade fries were amazing and I ate those up quicker then you could say my name.  

The onion rings need some help.  The batter tasted like something that you would expect on fish.  Same texture and taste.  And not necessarily a bad thing.  However, it would be fine if the onions were cut to the size to appropriate for the batter.  I say this because the onion rings tasted like batter versus onion rings.  Unless the onions are cut wider I would avoid them, which is unfortunate because they are almost there.  

Overall, try it.  Find what you like and enjoy!"}

Plus the entire onion doesn't come out after one bite like some other places make them *cough Harveys cough*. Also, you must try them with the rock star sauce, it's the most delicious combination! Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area/up for a burger!"}

{"text":"A few months ago, I had purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of food. I got a warning e-mail, indicating that it was about to expire in three days. Naturally, I made the effort to drive over to Whitby for a day trip.

After finishing my grocery shopping, I had worked up an appetite. I came here for lunch at around 13:30 on a Saturday. I walked in and looked at the extensive menu. There were a couple of tables with folks enjoying their food.

I ordered the Gaelic burger with a fried egg and bacon poutine. Hey, I have $20 to spend, so I might as well go for it. The woman checked to see whether she had eggs. We were both good.

Moments later, a couple walked in and were looking at the menu. The woman let me know that my order was ready. The couple stared at me getting my food, saying thanks to the woman, and walking back to my table. One word: weird.

My poutine and burger were placed in an oval metal pan. I liked it. My burger was carefully wrapped up.

I had to get up to get more napkins, a fork, and a knife. The burger is huge. I had to cut it in half so that I could fit it in my mouth. Trust me, you'll need plenty of napkins.

The burger was amazing! I will always go for a burger with mushrooms. The cheese sauce was perfect. I loved the fried egg. So good!

Oh, and the bacon poutine? It's the real deal. The cheese curds squeak when you eat them, as they should. The gravy was not overly salty. It was perfect. You get a ton of bacon, which made my day.

I washed everything down with a Diet Coke. Shamrock has milkshakes. I couldn't do it. Otherwise, I would have been in a food coma and would have to sleep it off at the restaurant.

The washroom is clean and well-kept. No complaints here.

I don't get why the ratings are so low here. I had a great experience and would definitely come back here again, with or without a Groupon.

Monster Sham ($10.60) is Two 10oz meat patties with cheese on a kaiser bun. And If I am hungry enough to finish that myself by completing the challenge I would have a $5 gift card so I can stuff my face with my burger!

I instead settled on the Classic Rock ($4.10) with my choice of condiments of fried onion, Rock sauce, tomato, and jalapeno pepper. My burger was cooked to order while I enjoying watching how the fat caught on fire while it was on the grill....... 

It was kind of messy when I started biting into it but the patty was moist and was just cook right. If you do want yours well done, please request that and they gladly did it for some of the other patrons. 

The Classic was good... I want more after eating that. Maybe, just maybe I will order a Monster Sham next time!"}

Wife and I ordered a 4oz combo with another 4oz burger. $17 for this. Price was a bit steep for what we got.
The burger was really good both my wife and I give them 2 thumbs up. The fries were pretty good.  
Summary a good burger but at a price. There are better spots around (Johnny's, 5 guys, Real McCoy) that are true to their roots."}

Positives:
Friendly staff

Generous portion of fries
Free refills

Cons:
Not cheap if you did not have a groupon
Small and no washroom 
Patty itself is small and thin
