{"text":"Large selection of subs and salads for a reasonable price. The staff is really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"SoO yummy, i think I'm going to be a regular at this joint.
I got my food fast, and my sub was meaty perfect."}
{"text":"Tried it based on Yelp review. I had meatball sub, which was nice and juicy. The music in the background was great, and the service fast. Recommend it to anybody looking for a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"My company had a very last minute order that we placed, and in my opinion it was relatively large. I got the final head count at around 4:00 pm on Thursday and needed meals for 80 on Saturday & Sunday. Corey was the one who responded to my email and we were able to arrange everything and pay for over the phone/ via email. We even had the added task of needing delivery and it was no sweat for them. What was really impressive is they handled our order even though it was for days they are normally closed.

We have these kinds of last minute requests from time to time and this by far has been the best choice we've made. We are a moving company and moving in the heat really makes you hungry. Everyone on the crew raved about the food. No one went hungry. We are used to the sandwiches that look like they have a lot of meat, but then have none. These were packed full sandwiches I would even say that they were noticeably heavy. 

Thank you to Corey and the Shortys crew who worked over the weekend for us. We look forward to next weekend! We really appreciate it and you have a repeat customer in us."}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches made fresh plenty of seating in side nothing too fancy great place for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"like there subs its good i rcomend it. I usally eat der once a week. you should try it"}
{"text":"This neighborhood needed some new, good, quick lunch spots.  All sandwiches on the menu are $5, and can be upgraded to a meal for an extra $2.50 (includes a side/chips, and a drink).  Each sandwich is made fresh to order, with whatever toppings you choose.  They are big enough to last me through two lunches!

This place is turning in to a mini-convenience store!  There's a little of everything in there.  Each time I go, there's a little more decor and personality.  I'm looking forward to  seeing how they do when they get more established!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place! Great sandwich shop that is family owned. Had the Italian sandwich with extra dressing. I will recommend Shorty's to anyone looking for a fast and delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"Shorty's has THE quality subs. The staff is friendly, the subs are quality and the beverage selection is great. Highly recommend trying Shorty's at least once."}
{"text":"Wow... my first experience is one that will keep me coming back again and again! 

The staff is super friendly, extremely helpful, and (its easy to see) passionate about their job!  The menu contains a long list of delicious items at great prices made fresh to order.  The bread / bun is soft, fluffy, and has an amazing flavor!  The store front also contains some convenience store items in which there is really something for everyone.

I would definitely recommend The Sandwich Company!"}
{"text":"Place was nice as well as the staff. Although, I asked for no mustard on my tuna (which was odd to offer already) and yet still go it on my sandwich. It was even crossed on the sheet they gave me. I didn't complain, because I don't trust food employees, being one previously and know what can goes on when someone does."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a couple years, sandwiches are great but the older lady is extremely rude."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot near work. The sandwiches and soups never disappoint. Definitely worth going out of your way for!

P.S. They also make some solid breakfast burritos if you get there before 11."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, friendly staff, speedy service"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, reasonable prices, very clean. I have never left unhappy. I look forward to going to this place every week."}
{"text":"Here for a conference fron Texas. Found this place here on yelp and it is very good!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! In an area where there is more industrial business & fast food... This is really a nice hole in the wall for those of us who work in the area. And they deliver! 

I suggest reviewing the menu online before going in. There is no menu posted inside. You have to grab the paper flyer to see choices. And there are a LOT of choices! They don't really explain much, kind of expect you to know what comes on each sandwich and you really have to tell them if you want to hold or add something. (I don't recommend the house dressing that automatically comes on most cold sandwiches- it makes some taste funny.) Their sandwiches are really good. They are more than a decent portion in size! Made fresh, so it is really quick, convenient & good! 

The interior could use some decor & a more inviting atmosphere. But I usually use delivery or get mine to-go on lunch break since it is conveniently less than a block away. Definitely better than Subway or the horrible Quiznos near by!"}
{"text":"The sign outside says Shorty's Sandwich.  This confused me and caused me to do a u-turn at 40th street and enter unsure if this was the right place.  It was.

Service was friendly and quick.  Ambiance is very basic almost hospital style.

I paid $32 for 4 sandwiches, 3 bags of chips and 3 drinks.  I thought that was a little high.  How much does it cost to make sandwiches at home?!

The bread is good.  The amount of meat on the sandwich is good.  A sandwich that doesn't list cheese (Roast Beef & Avocado) did indeed come with cheese so I had to pick it off.  Avocado was good.

They have fresh brewed iced tea so that is a plus!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Definitely don't cheat you on the meats at very affordable prices."}
{"text":"Love local places and this hit the spot on National Sandwich Day. Bread was nice and soft and loved the Turkey Bacon Avocado! Definitely want to go there again"}
{"text":"good sandwich,  tax-inclusive prices,  fair value and friendly staff ..  all good!   the dining area has that sterile sparse feel that a lot of independent and newly opened shops tend to have,   i'm sure they will flourish and get comfortable.      

turkey avocado was surprisingly good.   like that austrian dude said,  i'll be back"}
{"text":"Not sure if they make or by the bread but either way it is crazy good. Ordered a hot pastrami as it was my first time in and that was the special for the day. They destroy subway and Quiznos with quality, quantity and price. If you're feeling like having an awesome sandwich I'd highly recommend shortys. Service was really quick too which is always a plus"}
{"text":"You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH! 

Today, we went to Shorty's Sandwich Shop for lunch, and it was very good. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Shorty's are doing up sandwiches right.

Shorty's offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, chips, cookie and drink for under 10 bucks.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the turkey, roast beef,  and provolone  with a side of potato salad and chips.  The sandwiches are large, fresh, and the potato salad is some of the best I ever had. 

All the breads at Shorty's are made daily. If your in the area give Shorty's a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing little sandwich shop! I loved it! Good to eat here,highly recommended! ! cant even think of the words to write about how good it is! ask to try the deep fried apple sauce!"}
{"text":"Darn good sandwiches in an area that desperately needed a good food spot.  Met my brother for lunch, as he is a regular, and left satisfied. We both ordered I believe #23, the tuna, avocado, and jalape√±o sandwich. The bread was was very fresh and tasty and how could you go wrong with the other ingredients? With my order, I had to get a cookie as well as you can have a sandwich without a cookie. It was a little small but tasted great. The shop is large and offers plenty of seating and the food kicks out quick. Overall, a good spot for a quick, tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Always great! I live in Gilbert, thankfully my job is right down the road so I can go on lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this place- and it doesn't hurt that it's a block from my office! Shorty's is a simple sandwich shop that never goes wrong. The sandwiches are huge, bread is always fresh and they do not skimp on ingredients. Best part is the price is just right. Sandwiches run around  $5.50 and the most you will pay is $8.00 (The Phoenix which has everything on it!). Service is also great here. I have never been in when any of the counter people didn't have a smile and quick to help.

Overall this is a must try sandwich stop!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great bread and the sandwiches are fantastic.  I always get the #8 but my husband has tried a few different ones and always loves it.  The prices are very reasonable, this is my go to for a quick easy lunch on the days I am in a hurry.  The staff is always friendly and happy to see you, service is very quick even when they are slammed."}
{"text":"I was singing \"Shorty swing my way\" by K.P. & Envyi all the way there and back. (10 points if you can tell me the year that song was released.)

Shorty's is a popular lunch spot on Broadway Avenue in Phoenix for many that work nearby. It's a no frills sub shop that provides a quick lunch at a pretty decent price. The service counter staff was friendly and the food was good. I definitely didn't feel \"shorted\" on the amount of meat in my sandwich either. 

Thursday is Hot Pastrami sandwich day, so of course, that is what I ordered! It was a simple yet hearty sandwich. Hot Pastrami on a signature \"shorty roll\" served with melted provolone cheese, mustard, and a couple of pickle spears -YUM. I added a drink and some potato salad and made it a combo. Couldn't resist grabbing a chocolate chip cookie (which I later gifted to a friend).

Parking is a bit tight, but nothing too bad. It seemed like the neighboring businesses didn't mind when parking overflowed to their parking spots either. 

They have a loyalty program too, so make sure you pick up a punch card if you work nearby or plan to visit often. After the 10th punch you get a free lunch!  That's about a 10% savings of a typical combo lunch considering my meal today was about $11."}
{"text":"Super delicious, large portions (one sandwch can feed you the whole day hahaha) and very nice staff. I had the turkey-bacon-avocado and it made my day better! A+"}
{"text":"Came here during my lunch hour and ordered their chicken salad, minus the bacon - I know, I am probably one of the people out there that hates the stuff. When I got my order, glanced at it and all looked well. Got back to my office and apparently whoever made the salad threw a ton of bacon bits on there and probably scrapped them off the surface and threw on some more chicken to cover it up. Had a few bites and I mean, this pesky bacon is all over the place. Could only eat about a fourth of my salad - next time, if you make a mistake just start again, don't cover it up. Now I don't have time to run out for a baconless meal and I fear for my coworkers having to deal with my hangry self. 2 stars because the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while out of my normal area during training for work. Order was completed quickly as you would expect a sandwich should be and this is a good sandwich boy I tell you what. I'll be back for the next 2 days of training to try a couple more items off this huge menu."}
{"text":"My first time here, came with a co worker. We stumbled upon this place on accident and I've passed it a million times but I'm glad i know it's there now. Customer service was great, prices are good. I ordered the Italian sub, they are generous with their meat, and their veggies. Bread seemed to be fresh. Food arrived quickly. We will definitely back."}
{"text":"Came in here cause it was close to my location. Quick service, vast selection and cheap prices 

I had a Club (#6 on the menu) that was pretty solid and hit the spot. They had a lot of other choices that looked great and the combo comes with chips or salad and a drink. The sandwich itself was thick with a lot of toppings but not falling out of the bread, I even had enough room to put some chips between the bread. 

There was a sizable lunch crowd there and that told me it had to be alright with me not being a local. I would definitely come back and I recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"There's not a better sandwich shop around, I don't work around here and still find myself traveling 30 minutes from north Phoenix to eat here for lunch."}
{"text":"Best bread everrrrr! Haven't had a good Sammy like this in a long time!! It's a must to visit, don't deprive your tongue."}
{"text":"Great food shorty's is a great place for lunch. Thanks to all the employees for making shorty's a great place to eat"}
{"text":"This place should be putting the local Quiznos and Subway out of business. Cheap and delicious sandwiches that are served quick. Lots of meat for the money. Try the meatball sub it is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the best small business sandwich shop I've been to in a really long time. It's close to my work and I go there about 2 times a week. Their ingredients taste fresh and the prices are on point. I hate places like Subway that give you just a few slices of meat and bread that tastes like paper. You won't get that here!! 

I love the Italian Bomber, Philly Cheesesteak, or the Roast Beef with Avocado. (It's real sliced avocado btw, not the stuff a can.)

Their variety of pasta salads are all really good too!"}
{"text":"This was a real bummer. It was lunchtime and I was starving so I stopped in to get something to take back to work. The sandwiches looked great, but stupid me wanted to go with something healthy. I got a salad. The romaine lettuce was mostly the rib part, and it was an orange-brown color. I threw the salad away after trying to salvage a couple bites that weren't yucky. So I ended up just having a few calories for lunch. I still have 3 more hours at work and I'm still starving. And more than a little pissed off. Thanks Shorty's for shorting me on my lunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a sandwich from Shorty's food truck yesterday.  Great customer interaction, excellent quality sandwich and the presentation was spot on!  We will definitely check out their location on Broadway."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my couchsurfing hosts while in Phoenix.

While not a fan if short reviews, there's not much to say here. Shorty's is just another sandwich shop that can mostly be replicated at home. I had turkey avocado and drowned the flavorless sub out with hot sauce. 

The staff were friendly and seemed cool and the place was filled mostly with professionals on lunch break. 

The interior had potential towards a trendy industrial vibe, but seemed like it was missing something. 

Also, menus aren't in plain or obvious sight, so be sure to find one located near the drinks or register. 

All-in-all, this may be worth one stop, but I wouldn't openly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow! This is such a great sandwich place. The hot pastrami is fantastic. But then again so is the BLT and the Tuna. Fantastic food at a fantastic price. 

Not far from work, the people are friendly. I'm working towards my free lunch with their punch card. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a Turkey sandwich with cheese, pretty basic. It was okay! Nothing spectacular...

The place looks clean, most of the staff seems friendly. They don't have a menu you can order from that's at plain sight.

When they asked me if I wanted \"Everything\" on it... I didn't know what that was being my first time.... The girl taking my order pointed to the flyer menu and seemed annoyed I didn't know. 

I took my order to go and got a wrapped sandwich, a bag of chips and a drink to carry out the door. It was a bit of a hassle since most of us ladies carry a purse, cell phone, car keys and you still have to manage to open the door."}
{"text":"Good sandwich had the turkey avocado. Potato salad is really good and is not full of onions like some are. Always busy. Food comes Out quick if your short on time. Highly recommend this sandwich shop to everyone"}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything but the El Jefe burrito which is often except for this last time they forgot the chorizo and the salsa but I called back and Travis was nice enough to give us another burrito he explained they we're very busy that morning with a huge order and could have gotten mixed up. I still love this place and just because Travis was so nice I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I came here as I was looking for food and they were not a chain and had good reviews. Upon pulling into the parking lot, I saw a specials board placed by the door with a list of daily sandwiches. The menu is displayed right when you walk in in large lettering which I'm sure people can appreciate. The cashier was warm, welcoming, and a cutie! I got the Italian bomber (sandwich of the day) to go on wheat, with everything on it, and with chips and a drink for $9. The bread was great as well as their house sauce.  The sandwich was satisfying and now I am sitting here wishing I could regurgitate it and eat it again. Yup, I said it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops, I highly recommend either the Italian Bomber or the AZ Philly. I have a hard time choosing between those two every time I go. I have tried a few of their other sandwiches, but nothing that compares to these two. I have also tried their breakfast burritos... I stick to their sandwiches. The macaroni salad is also very good. The cashier is always very friendly and the sandwiches come out pretty quickly. I would suggest getting there before noon or after 1:00 pm if possible because this place gets pretty busy at lunch time."}
