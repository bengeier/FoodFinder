{"text":"Excellent pizza for afordable cost  Open till 4am  Great service  Nothing negative to say"}
{"text":"Ok, this is a really cheap place for takeout that also happens to be pretty good tasting. Definitely not healthy in any type of way but it's like a \"Well, that wasn't too bad at all for the price.\" Unfortunately from somewhere between placing the order and the delivery at your door happens. It's never their fault and don't think about credit or replacing  you might order a submarine and chicken and at your door it's a pizza. Like i know that 50% of the times I've ordered from them it's been different stuff but I like their food so it's like rolling the dice!"}
{"text":"La pizza est très bonne je ne la mangerais pas avec une bouteille de vin mais comparativement à ce qu'on trouve dans le coin 13$ pour une Xlarge le mardi soir devant un bon film.  La propreté du restaurent laisse un peu à désirer et de toute évidence il on besoin de refaire la déco. La femme qui ma accueilli et servi était très gentille aussi, je vais y retourner."}
{"text":"Their 2 pizza fries and a drink special is a great deal. Delivered right to our hotel."}
{"text":"This was one of the only places open at 1am on a Friday night by a karaoke bar yet it seemed like they were not expecting a late night crowd. The chefs were very slow and the poor girl at the counter was extremely stressed out by the waiting customers. We also found the food to be mediocre, the burger was particularly bad tasting."}
