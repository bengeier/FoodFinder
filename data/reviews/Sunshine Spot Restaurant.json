{"text":"It's hard to find genuine, inexpensive and unpretentious diners nowadays, especially in North York. This is a great all-day breakfast joint, and they have lots of lunch items and sandwiches as well. If you like eggs benedict, I can tell you that their hollandaise sauce is more delicious and generous than tons of other more expensive places in the city. Service is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood go-to breakfast/brunch place. Good portion, good price, and an all around hole-in-the-wall good feel. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is actually freshly squeezed. It's a very popular neighbourhood eatery so it gets crowded during the weekends, may need to wait a while for seats if going there close to noon."}
{"text":"I had a terrible time at this breakfast place. 
For starters, my fiancé asked for his eggs to be scrambled, they came out over easy. We made it very clear that as a dietary restriction, I do not eat pork and asked for the bacon and sausages to be substituted for turkey bacon. When the food came out, there was regular bacon! What was quite upsetting was that the server did not seem to care for this mistake. 
Lastly, my eggs were undercooked because the whites of the eggs were runny. Overall most of the food was undercooked, the server lacked attentiveness, and I actually left more than 50% of my meal.
This was quite disappointing. For a $40 breakfast, I would never come back here again."}
{"text":"I wake up on Saturday mornings and crave the Bacon Veggie Melt
It's a Benedict style dish with green peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and bacon atop a perfect poached egg and an english muffin covered in hollandaise & cheese. SO GOOD! About standard pricing $9 range for Benny
Kids breakfast is really nice -not cheap but good portion 
The place is a bit small, but the food is fresh, you can see the guys making it.
Saturday and Sunday mornings there can be a wait but it's worth it.

My husband tried to steer away from a Benedict and got the Corned Beef Hash, he was extremely disappointed, It was chopped up meat on the side of the plate next to his eggs and potatoes. When he complained the girls didn't do much about it, just brought him some bacon. 
Otherwise we love the place."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was ok. 

My friend ordered \"The Greens' Egg White Omelette\"  On the menu below all the Omelettes it states \"All omelettes served with toast and home fries\"  however when the waitress took our order she told us that the omelette my friend ordered didn't get toast and home fries.  I pointed out that the menu clearly says ALL OMELETTES.. but she said that omelette was special so that didn't apply. Great way to make your customers annoyed by putting deceptive advertising in your menu.

I don't know if it was just the day we visited but the clientele was a bit sketchy.  The customer at the table next to us was complaining to his friends loudly about the terms of his house arrest that he was under (not sure why he was in a restaurant if he's under house arrest).

This last thing is a bit nitpicky but the pictures of the food in the menu looked like they were taken on a cheap cell phone, not appetizing looking at all.  Businesses should really spend a couple hundred bucks to get a pro to take the pictures of their food because if you don't, right away it makes your place look like it cuts corners and is mediocre, which this place is."}
{"text":"Smoked salmon Benedict was great.  The eggs were cooked just right.  It's a hidden gem in the neighborhood.
It would be better if their deco was newer & more modern.  The restaurant looks very old."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS GROUP!!!
We've brought many a fam and friend for breakfasts and brunches here!!
We love the ENTIRE staff. 
The chefs are amazing and when they heard my one friend wasn't having eggs, they surprised him with a super fancy grilled cheese stacked with yummy vegs.
Another day recently we brought a friend with a 1yr old and a 3yr old; who were a little jet-lagged to say the least :) 
Our two waitresses just kept smiling, bringing new utensils, laughing. 
They were SO patient with us.
It's nice and quiet in the back end, if you're feeling like a low-key spot after a late night.  Or you can sit at the front tables/booths filled with sunshine and chatter.
I wish they had a bit more space because these guys are POPULAR!
You can't shame them for being busy.
Sunshine Spot - We LOVE you! :*"}
{"text":"ordered egg benedict with smoked salmon ($9.99) and classic french toast ($9.99) with sausage. very good food but service was a bit slow. nice environment and quiet. polite waitress.good for breakfast and brunch, a lot of couples were dining there.the hollandise sauce was a bit different from others' diners, a little bit less sour and dense, but still we loved the taste!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 2 pm, an hour before closing.  Sat down, they were vacuuming the store.  Fine, I understand they need to clean, but once a customer sits down, it's rude and unacceptable to keep vacuuming.  Being the only customer, the message given was I'm not important enough to stop their cleaning and provide a decent atmosphere.  No class."}
{"text":"Was at North York General the whole night and desperately looking for a place for breakfast. Consulted Yelp and came across this greasy spoon / breakfast restaurant in a strip mall next to MEC, beside a Japanese fish market. We ordered the Big Big ($12.99) and the Breakfast Tacos ($10.99). Portions were not bad; pretty average. 

TASTE: 6/10 - You can't really screw up bacon, sausage and (over-easy) eggs...Though I query powdered eggs for omelette inside breakfast tacos. Home fries were pretty good - crispy on outside, soft on inside. Coffee was average.
FOOD TEMPERATURE: 7.5/10 - OK/acceptable. 
PRESENTATION: 7/10 - didn't really need thought; eggs for where eggs go, bacon goes where bacon goes...
CLEANLINESS: 7/10 - Not bad. Washroom was clean; no yucky smell.
SERVICE: 4/10 - Below average. Had to ask for coffee refill. 
WILL I COME AGAIN?: Probably. If I was desperate for a greasy spoon brekkie close to Leslie/Sheppard area."}
{"text":"Got our order wrong, potatoes were all raw and when we told our server Anthusa she completely disregarded us and laughed in our face. If you want horrible service, dirty environment and staff who do not care, this is a place for you. Would never recommend, you're better of at Tim Hortons (and I'm not even the biggest fan) ."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Why does this place get such awesome reviews?

Maybe things have changed a lot since the positive, 4-5 star ratings were made.  When we first arrived, I actually overheard the table next to us exclaim that the menu and the food had changed so much since they had last dropped in ~7 months ago.  

Having received a Buy 1 Get 1 Free (with a mandatory drink purchase) coupon in my mailbox, the hubs and I decided to come here for brunch.  We both ordered the Eggs Benny.  I ordered mine with a small glass of fresh-pressed orange juice plus an extra side of hollandaise (y'know, as a shooter, the way normal people do - heh heh) and the asked for regular bacon and a coffee.  Replacing the peameal  bacon with the regular streaky type came at no extra cost, but the hollandaise costs an extra $1.99 served in one of those small metal cups that often holds melted butter for lobsters. If you substitute the bacon for spinach, smoked salmon, or other protein, it will cost an additional $1.99.

My orange juice was alright, it wasn't very sweet - maybe it's not orange season yet?  Forgivable, given that I don't expect produce to be perfect, but I do wish it were served cold rather than tepid. 

The hollandaise sauce didn't really taste like much of anything, and I'm pretty sure it came out of a can rather than being house-made.  The English muffins are served untoasted, so you'll have to ask for them to be toasted in advance if you prefer them that way.  Potatoes were OK, grilled to a crispy brown on one side but seems like they didn't have enough time to flip it over to the other, totally ungrilled side.  On the plus, the hubs' eggs were served pretty perfectly poached.

At the end of our meal, we went to pay the bill and was mischarged 3 times - the cashier kept cancelling and re-entering the order, charging for a large size orange juice ($4.99) rather than a small ($2.99).  In the end, she ended up still cancelling the small orange juice and punching in a large again.  We didn't realize it until we had left, but given that she had forgotten to charge us for the extra hollandaise we were only overcharged by $1 so didn't bother going back in.  

It's a really convenient location for those of us in the Willowdale area and the price points are quite reasonable, with the most expensive breakfast item topping at $12.99.  If you have 2 for 1 meal coupon, your meal with a drink will cost about $10 which is pretty good considering that's what you'd end up paying even at fast food places.  All in all I'd come back again for convenience, but if you're in the mood for some serious brunching I still prefer the downtown area."}
{"text":"After going to a different breakfast place a couple of days ago I realized what a hidden gem this place is. They are very generous with their portions, and their eggs Benedict is very appetizing. Would be five stars if the service, and ambiance stepped up it's game."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place came by for Sunday brunch but was disappointed we ordered the eggs benedict the steak and eggs and a kids meal my eggs were blanched not post and vastly undercooked unfortunately the steak was a little salty and not perfectly consistent with the other orders we saw coming out by the end of everything with one extra orange juice the bill was close to $50 we waited for service and the wait staff seems he prioritizing Cutlery over bringing us additional copies and our bill not thrilled"}
{"text":"This is a standard, small, \"family restaurant\".  I met friends for breakfast on a Monday at 9:30 am.  Though the place was virtually empty, the waitress was inattentive.

The eggs, home fries, toast and coffee were all about average for a diner, but by a few accounts, the bacon was superb.

If you're in the area, drop in, but it's not worth making a trek."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Great portions and prices. My fiancé and I were impressed by the constant hot, fresh coffee and how friendly the staff were. 

Came for Sunday brunch and while it was busy we did not have to wait. The staff were very efficient, very friendly. 

I had the smoked salmon, spinach, and feta omelette with brown toast and a side of sausage. FYI: their sides mean business. I got four sausages not the usual two. Fiancé got three eggs, bacon, and sausage. Bacon was perfectly crispy and sausage was nicely done. 

Definitely will come back again and highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent greasy spoon breakfast place for typical brunch eats, then you'll be ok to try this place out. Nothing to rave about.
Service and atmosphere - busy on the weekends so the wait staff don't really have time to come back and check on you or refill your coffee unless you ask them. Though they are pleasant when they are serving you.
Food - ordered the eggs benedict and side of pancakes. Eggs benedict were done right...nice and runny and the hollandaise was smooth. Peameal bacon wasn't dry. However the english muffin could have been toasted a bit more. The potato hash was more like boiled potatoes vs fried. They need to be more fried up to have that nice crust. Also the pancakes were tastey but had a bit of chewiness.  They probably overmix the batter. Portion size of the dishes were ok. 
Overall - this place was good enough if you're looking for a typical breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing experience grabbing an early morning breakfast here. The wait staff didn't show up until 1.5 hours after they opened. So we were served by the chef and the service was not great as they barely spoke English and got my order wrong. Because the kitchen staff was doing server duty as well they were a little frazzled and took a while to cook the meals, also noticed them handling money and then food without washing their hands. The food was okay but nothing special at all. Small family run place that probably runs decently when not having staffing issues but overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT breakfast!!!!  Crisp smoked bacon and three eggs, home fries, and thick toast with jam!!  Coffee was great!!  Had three cups!!  Prices are reasonable for the portion size!!  
Great local place!!  Friendly staff!!  Great service!!!  Looking forward to coming back for eggs Benny!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the 4 of us liked it ... loved the crispy bacon ... great service too..."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here for the past five years. It is in my opinion, the best breakfast place in the north York up town area. They have scrumptious French toast, real squeezed orange juice, and great eggs and sausage combo. The breakfast spot has the feel of a old-school diner. Family run restaurant.  Easy parking on the outside, a good hidden local spot."}
{"text":"Won't be back anymore. Last couple times have been a disappointment. Every time I order the Eggs Benedict, it seems like they lose most of the egg whites in the water (not great at poaching eggs). This time my omelette was burnt and so were my girlfriend's \"over medium\" eggs. Trying to get more milk for her tea was a chore (as the servers were standing around talking to each other even after we asked for more milk). Had to walk up to the counter to get it. $2 to add about a tablespoon of tomatoes to an omelette?? Please. I felt upset paying for the damn bill. I'd rather give the $30 to a junky knowing they'd just go buy some smack."}
{"text":"The Fruit Explosion pancakes are to die for!  My only issue is trying to decide between their Eggs Benny or pancakes."}
{"text":"Found this place by default.  I was heading to MEC which is located beside the restaurant.  Good classic all day breakfast type menu.  Clean and friendly.  Looks like it's a local favourite."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, not expensive. It's suprisingly tough to find a place in the city that can make your favourite breakfast and lunch staples, and make them right. A smarter alternative to the plethora of overpriced restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very typical brunch place.  The Eggs Benedict was cheap at 10.99 and they willingly subbed my peameal bacon for smoked salmon at no charge.  The seating felt kind of cafeteria like though, the tables and chairs being hard and uncomfortable, as if I was eating at a food court. The service was also quite slow (hard for one chef to maintain the whole restaurant, but there wasn't a lot of people there especially at 730 in the morning).  

The only thing they really have going for them is the cheapness, other than that service and the food was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"New menu less items. Seems like it went downhill after the menu has changed. Wasn't too impressed by the food. Was extremely disappointed with the service. Server came back multiple times to ask for our order when we didn't even had a chance to read the menu. When we wanted the bill she was just talking on her cell phone so I had to go to the cashier to pay coz she was obviously not paying any attention and when I asked for a box to go. She point in the direction and told me to get it myself. Pretty disappointed with my visit this time. Usually it's been your average all day breakfast place but today was way below average. My husbands steak was way too salty and my breakfast tacos was too cheesy. The home fries weren't even cooked enough. Oh and almost forgot to mention, my husbands orange juice had a fly inside. But she did exchange it for a new one."}
{"text":"-1 for a questionable cleanliness of table (sticky) and knife (quite stained).

We came for brunch one day because we were in the area, Taro wasn't opened yet, and Grandpa didn't want Shater Abbas. There were a few tables occupied, but the majority of the tables were empty. Mind you, this was a weekday about noon. Service throughout was quite friendly.

Grandpa got the steak and eggs with salad. Not bad. We thought the steak was super chewy because we were struggling to cut it with our steak knife, but it turns out the steak was more tender than we thought (although it could have been better still) and it was the knife that sucked. The salad was not bad at all.

I got the eggs benedict. At $10.99 for the standard with peameal bacon, that's already a fairly good price. 2 eggs, hollandaise, english muffins. Comes with breakfast potatoes. I got mine upgraded to smoked salmon. There was no upcharge. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. YESSSSSS. When it came, there was actually a good amount of smoked salmon, so it's not like they skimped on it. All in all, a very satisfying meal at a very good price.

I'd come back for the eggs benedict. I'd stick to Pickle Barrel for steak and eggs though."}
{"text":"On my way uptown and got hungry - so we found this little gem by the highway. 

Cute shop, lots of options on the menu. The food was plenty and quite delicious.

a bit disappointed about a couple of things:
1) the dutch waffle should be called just.. waffle - with fruits and whipped cream. the dish didn't have all the caramel thin dutch waffle appeal at all. erm... i think this is a bit false advertisement.
2) they didn't have the bacon veggie melt anymore. well they can make it \"just for me\" but it's a whopping 15 dollars. -_- pass.

so anyways, good coffee, a bit disappointing about the food/mis-advertising of their foods. french toast looked good - will try that, and other things perhaps if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service, all this place is missing is some nicer decor. We ordered the Italian breakfast and a spinach eggs benny. Both were prepared perfectly. The Italian breakfast came with a pancake and French toast covered in mascarpone sauce and strawberries. Sososo delicious. The coffee is also the perfect blend - tasted like a mix of Starbucks blonde and pike, for half the price + refills. 

The food was great, no complaints at all. But what made this place wonderful is the service. The servers and chefs were so accommodating and welcoming. 

I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"If you're too lazy to make your own breakfast and you are craving eggs, potatoes, pancakes, toast, waffles, and fruits, then this is your joint. Will you get a spectacular breakfast? Not quite.

The food was overwhelmingly under seasoned. We had to add salt and pepper to our eggs and potatoes. Nonetheless, at least the meal was cooked right; I ordered over-easy eggs and the eggs did come out with a watery center. Many of their menu items contain meat and they won't allow you to sub your meat for a vegetable option (like mushrooms or tomatoes), even though the vegetable option is a lot cheaper than the meat. Although they do allow you to substitute your meat in the eggs benedict to smoked salmon, they won't allow you to do that in their other menu items, which I find hard to understand why the eggs benedict are the only exception. 

Service was decent, the waitress was kind in taking our order and serving out group--we had about 8 of us and she was patient. The seating arrangement was somewhat cramped, but then again, we did have 8 people in our party. I will say, it may be best to come with 2-4 people for comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Pretty good placefor breakfast around the area. Average, I'm not a coffee person but I think the coffee is good. I would say it's smooth, better than any of the big chain."}
{"text":"I ordered the angus steak and It was truely awsome!!!! It was super great than I expected."}
{"text":"First time here and it's great!
Clean little restaurant with friendly service. 

I had All Day Breakfast and hubby had Rittata.
Good amount of food with decent price.

Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have always noticed this restaurant in passing, was always curious and finally took the plunge to see why it is always so busy on the weekends, I would have to say it is your typical breakfast spot. It looks very small inside but there is actually alot of room and it fills up quick on weekends.

The food is just your average breakfast and lunch options. Its fine, nothing amazingly tasty but if you are in the area and want to grab a bite, this place is acceptable as long as they are not too busy because then the attentiveness from the server seems to be lacking."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice and heir breakfast ends at 3 pm . I went once at 230 and once at 245. Both times the staff was sitting eating and said today we closed early as its a holiday . So if u want to have breakfast go early or don't go highly unprofessional place."}
{"text":"Me and my friend tried this place one morning after dropping my wife at work a couple months ago and wow were we disappointed. Thanks for leading us to a dump all you 4-5 star raters. Oh and 3 out of 4 Google + reviews are fake, obvious by the broken English and lack of background from the reviewers. Shame on you.

I had the eggs benny and it was horrible, runny and bland sauce, bad and under cooked homefries with worse service. My friend had a standard eggs and bacon breakfast which she said was also extremely underwhelming.

Not only was the food horrible and the price too high for what you get, but this place would be better served as a adult film store due to the bad lighting than a restaurant calling itself the \"Sunshine Spot\".

With two great breakfast places nearby, Windfield's and Valley Fields, why anyone would ever go back here is a mystery to me."}
{"text":"Overall a good spot for breakfast. 
I wouldn't suggest the pancakes, not the best I've had."}
{"text":"This unpretentious little spot in a tiny strip mall serves excellent breakfasts.  Omelet was delicious as were the home fries, which were fresh and not too greasy.  No one in our party ordered one of the berry topped omelets, but they looked fantastic.  They do also have varying daily specials.

Friendly and helpful service might be a little slow when busy.  No ambience to speak of.  Small size of restaurant makes it unsuitable for large groups."}
{"text":"Feels charmless and dingy inside, unless you get one of the few spots near a window. 

The food, coffee, and service were adequate for the money, but seated at the back with so many people packed in I can't say it was exactly pleasant."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast / brunch spot in Toronto. This place serves up tasty food! It's not the most hipster in ambience but do not judge a restaurant by its appearance. I call it \"family style\". The restaurant looks small on the outside but there's plenty of seating inside and it's kind of easy to miss but you'll be glad to try this place if you like breakfast food. 

Onto the review...

Coffee is light and mild - usual diner style. It's pretty cheap at $1.50 for bottomless. 

Service is on the slow side. Seemed like there was only one person running the front of house. 

Their Bennys are great. Excellent hollandaise sauce! I tried my friend's bacon cheese melt on English Muffin. It's up there with the best of 'em. Served with potatoes. Tip: ask for potatoes to be cooked extra crispy. It tastes much better this way! 

Perfectly cooked over medium eggs, delicious rye toast (two kinds too - light and dark :D), and choice of meat - for me it was bacon day! It came with like 5 strips or something like that. I was kind enough to give away a few :) 

Moderate prices, good food, a keeper!"}
{"text":"When you're tired of McMuffins and are in the mood for a real breakfast that's simple and filling and won't break the bank, go to Sunshine Spot. It's what you'd expect from a diner-style breakfast, with slightly underdone home fries and plentiful heaps of scrambled eggs and breakfast meats. The benedicts are a reliable choice, and the OJ is freshly squeezed. The specials are usually an adventurous departure from their usual fare, and are worth trying. It can get really busy on weekend mornings though, so anticipate a busy atmosphere at those times. But crowds are a good sign here, I think :)"}
{"text":"Pros:
Prices are pretty good
Friendly staff

Cons:
Seats in the back feel cold and drafty

Sunshine spot is probably my go to spot for western style breakfast.  I think it's a step above the chain places (eggsmart, sunset grill etc.) as well.  

Sunshine spot offers pretty much all the items you would find for breakfast.  I find they also offer a lot of variety within those items.  They have about 10 varieties of eggs benedict and omelets.  There's a good amount of breakfast platters and some specialties as well.  The prices are pretty good across the board.  I would of liked at least a coffee or tea included but at the prices, I can't complain.  I do have to mention that the home fries here are not deep fried in oil.  They are put on the grill and made there.  I think they're much better this way so points for this!!

My only small nitpick is the price of the drinks relative to portion.  For stuff like juice and milk, the could give you a bigger glass.  Small thing, but something to mention.

The staff are always pretty nice when I come.  I have never had a bad service related incident here in the many visits I have had in the past.  They were pretty accommodating when it came to my little one.  I haven't been there since we had our second, but I have no doubt they will be just as good when we go with both.

The place has plenty of seats but I find during the cold months if you sit it the back, it's pretty drafty and for people who don't like the cold too much,you might have to put back on your jacket. 

Overall, I highly recommend sunshine spot for breakfast.  Great food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Service is good. They were busy when we arrived so we ended up with a seat by the door which was comfortable but tight for four.

They have a convenient location just off the highway, making it a good spot for breakfast before hitting the road out of town. 

The food here is generally good. We tried the eggs benedict (with smoked salmon!) and the breakfast taco. The portion sizes were quite large and the hollandaise sauce was deliciously thick and creamy. I wish they were a bit more generous with the breakfast taco, as they are in the display picture (heaping amounts of salsa, and lots of filling) but it's close enough to be passable.

No WiFi here. The WiFi network with their name on it is reserved for their payment processor (hint: if that's the case, don't name the network after your restaurant)."}
{"text":"They didn't get anything wrong but it wasn't extraordinary. Food, service, ambience was average. Ordered eggs Benny with smoked salmon and crispy chicken sandwich. Good if you need a change of pace or something quick in the immediate neighborhood, but otherwise not memorable."}
{"text":"Does not honor the online order advertised when you Google the place. Staff not too friendly."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 10:30am. When we sat down we were offered coffee and it was periodically refilled. Most of the time I like long menus because I like options. But in this case I had a hard time deciding what to get because there were too many options. Also, I wanted a breakfast that combined sweet and savory. I mentioned to the waitress that I could not find a combo that came with 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and pancakes. She then suggested that I get the \"Canadian Pancakes\" which came with 3 eggs, peameal bacon and 2 pancakes, but rather than 2 pancakes she gave me one pancake and hash brows. It was exactly what I wanted. The waitress was incredibly accommodating, so that was a huge plus.

My breakfast: The eggs still needed another minute. The clear jelly-like material around the yolk should be cooked through before serving.  Other than that, the breakfast was good. Simple, but it did the job for $8.99. For what we got, I think the price was a bit high. I remember the days when breakfast at a diner never exceeded $5. Are those days really gone?

We had a good time at Sunshine Spot.  The service was great and the food was okay, but we will likely not make the trek here again."}
{"text":"Great basic lunch bar, old style.  Lots of choice, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I do not know what's the hype here.  The place is packed at about 10am on a Saturday morning....
Sat down, ordered coffee and peameal eggs benedict.  Coffee came, it was mediocore, but it was OK...my intention is to try out the eggs benedict. 
It finally came, it looks not bad with home fries..however when I cut the first one, the egg was fully cooked!! The other one is 80% cooked...no runny egg yolk!  The hollandaise sauce was alright...not the best but not the worst.  Homefries was bland!  

Anyway will not return for sure.  I don't know why there are so many people here.

Service was not bad though."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is AMAZING! Only been here 3 times before my boyfriend has been there so many times in his life they remember him lol"}
{"text":"Your standard breakfast place. Offers the usual fare of eggs + meat pile, waffles, French toast, etc. Eggs Benedict has a decent hollandaise sauce. They will make fresh squeezed orange juice to order which is quite good."}
{"text":"Fair prices and friendly staff. I like coming here for its simplicity.  Some days I just want a traditional brunch with sunny side up eggs, bacon, and home fries.  The peameal bacon comes in a large enough portion that I'd have to start giving away to friends. It's also very greasy.  The eggs benedict is a good option too."}
