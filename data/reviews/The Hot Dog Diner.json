{"text":"Good experience, staff extremely friendly and outgoing provided very welcome feel. We tried burgers, fries and hot dogs. Burgers were fresh made and fries were fresh cut, cooked perfectly. They have a wide variety of homemade BBQ sauces, mustards and ketchups which provides a fun adventure.   One tip, they have several types of hot dogs you can choose beyond the toppings styles.  They have regular, snappy, jumbo, etc. Be sure to ask about the difference. My wife got a regular and found it small. She should have ordered a second one or perhaps another type that would have been larger, but she didn't notice the options. Counter person was eager to answer any question, we just didn't ask that one. They have an extensive menu which is really great but harder to navigate for a first-timer.  Would definitely go back to try more options."}
{"text":"Toppings are all fresh cut and sauses are hand made. Makes for Great hot dogs and great food. Crazy dave makes great home brewed ice tea."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different for dinner and decided to try this place out.  I got the Hillbilly dog, and it was amazing!  Hubby got the tail wagger (VERY spicy) and a sauerkraut dog.  Everything was great!  My son wanted a pickle out of a jar, I was nervous, but it was crunchy and delicious.  The only reason I wasn't over the moon on was the chili cheese fries.  They weren't as good as just the plain ole fries.  We WILL be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good local food and fresh ingredients (I.e. Fresh lettuce and tomato on my burger). Burger meat was a little salty, however. Fries were decent but chili was also extremely salty (we got chili cheese fries with sour cream). For fast food it is good, but I would rather have five guys for that style of food. It is a good local alternative, though. We will probably try it again and get hot dogs next time and perhaps try the hush puppies or pierogis instead of the fries."}
{"text":"Good prices and good food. You can get a hot dog 50 different ways and if you're not in the mood for a hot dog they have burgers"}
{"text":"I would say that there are few places in the Cleveland area that I would be willing to adjust my plans during a day to go eat, and this is one of those places! The owner is friendly and personable, greeting you by name when you come back to eat there. Never a problem to get a seat and for an old taco bell, it is very accommodating in terms of room in the benches and at the tables.  The atmosphere reminds me of an old school diner, the kind you see on Happy Days and in many old time movies. The food is made to order, and after a few visits you can be sure they have your regular order down to memory. Everything about this place screams \"Small Town Diner\" which makes for a great atmosphere to eat and relax in.  The food itself is the biggest draw, as this place is what I would consider my promised land of burgers. I know the name says \"hot dog diner\" but you gotta try the burgers! Hot, fresh, made to order (with condiments ranging from the basics to French fries and a scrambled egg!) the fries are great and are definitely bigger than the average sizes, a small will more than be enough for two people  I like to look for a \"wow factor\" at any place I eat, and Hot Dog Diner has that with its deep fried pierogis, easily the best ode to the community you're gonna find in Cleveland!  Overall, great place, great food, great owner, and just a flat out great place to eat. If you love All-American food with a penchant for creativity, then Hot Dog Diner is the place for you"}
{"text":"Good people and good food.  Unlike some places that I have ate at, they do know what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"Dogs and fries were great. Fast friendly service. It ain't fine dining, it's  a hot dog diner. And a rally good one at that."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best hot dogs around hands down! Fresh cut fries just like at the fair, and their milk shakes are great!! Haven't had a burger yet but I've been told they are great!! Not to mention the owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"We had not stopped for a while, but it was a good as ever!! Had a burger this time, and it did not disappoint. Others had the crispy hot dogs and they loved those too. Great fries and great service. What is not to love. Thanks for the wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!! Will be back. It's a little greasy for some people but I fit right in with that!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here tonight for the first time and it was amazing! We came really close to closing time - 7:30 with a close at 8 - without realizing but everyone working seemed unfazed. The girl who took our order answered our questions and gave great suggestions. There were so many options it was hard to choose but my boyfriend got the 5 for $5 deal and cheese fries and I got a cowboy dog and pierogies. Everything was really delicious and reminiscent of places we frequented in Chicago which is a huge compliment! The store was cleaned around us and we weren't rushed in the slightest. The owner came around and greeted us warmly and told us to take our time. Everyone was extremely polite and professional and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a simple meal done perfectly!"}
{"text":"Situated in an unassuming building next to a title company, this amazing restaurant is a must-do.  Having read the reviews (and also having an excuse to drive to Parma), my wife and I went there on a Saturday for lunch.  I had the Windy City hot dog and my wife had the Backyard burger.  Both were excellent.  In fact, the burger was even better than the hot dog.  Even better, however, were the french fries.  They were PERFECTLY cooked, nice and crunchy.  I'd go back even only for the fries.  If you're anywhere near Parma, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit the first time.......the only bad comment.....is they are closed on Monday's.  Very good.....everything!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped today for a late lunch, first time there, definitely worth it. My husband ordered the Lone Star, pulled pork and I had the Kielbasa with kraut, onion and mustard, the small fried were very good and more than enough for both of us. Will return soon to try something else, great menu, more than enough to choose from, priced well. Open Tues through Saturday 10:30am - 7:30pm."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, as I knew the owners brother, and I love hotdogs, but it has really missed the mark, and I can't find any positive reasons to go back.  I have tried several of the dogs, and wasn't impressed by any of them.  I had a chili sauerkraut dog the was ruined by both toppings, the kraut being mushy and chili just tasted like canned crap.  Don't mind paying extra for extra toppings, but $1 for onions on a hot dog seems like a stretch, as everything is an extra.  The snappy dogs are ok, but not nearly as good as others I've had.  The regulars are boring and bland."}
{"text":"Not bad- for Cleveland. Ordered the Windy City dog. Had to add tomato and pickles. For pickles, all they had were hamburger chips, so had to make do. Forgot to have them put cheese on it. I think the dog was grilled (not boiled-good, but not char grilled- would have been better). Not as big as a Weiner Circle dog, but tasty none the less.   Had a small order of fries with cheese sauce that was excellent. One of the most unique aspects of this place, outside of occupying an old Taco Bell, is their selection of ketchups, mustards and bbq sauces (see picture).   This being Parma, they also have a Pierogi Burger.  I was going to have to stop back another time to try one of those, then decided to get one right now. A third pound fresh beef pattie topped with a potato and cheese pierogi, grilled onions, sour cream and cheese sauce, on a toasted, fresh buttered bun. It was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here today for our birthday. Yes OUR we share the same birthday. The #1 thing is the food came to our table way faster than we anticipated which was great. And they even bring it over to the table even with the small dining area (not a knock on the restaurant at all, it's an old taco Bell building). I ordered the loaded potato burger, my wife ordered just a simple bacon cheeseburger. From the taste of the burger I can tell the grill is older which gave the burger some great flavor. The buns they use for the burgers taste buttery, without being soggy. We also split the pizzaroni spuds which are excellent. The fries themselves are hand cut and well seasoned. The staff is very kind as well."}
{"text":"Really liked these guys when they first opened.  Hot dogs were great especially the Chicago Dog.  When they moved to a former Taco Bell, it was great because they had a drive thru-loved to get my dogs on the go, then one day drive thru closed, with a picnic table positioned awkwardly in its place.  One of the single worst decisions you can make.  The drive thru was already there from good ole' Taco Bell, so why close it and say goodbye to more revenue for busy people or those that loved the food put couldn't go inside? Sorry, but you lost a star because of this.  Secondly, the cleanliness inside the place is spotty at best.  I always feel like the place is in need of a good scrubbing and mopping.  I used to go here when it was Taco Bell and the place was always clean- what gives?  Tighten up your game."}
{"text":"For what this place is and and what they do...well worth the effort of seeking them out!  Operating out of an old Taco Bell restaurant, these guys have a variety of fun and interesting hot dog varieties and concoctions along with very good (fast casual style) burgers and hand-spun milkshakes.  I've had the pierogi burger and western burger along with hand-cut fries and onion rings...and I've also had two different shakes - one with chocolate and peanut butter and another with peaches.  All items were cooked fresh when ordered, and the team behind the counter is fun and engaging with customers.  An unusual atmosphere, but a cool experience topped with good food."}
{"text":"3 specialty dogs, tots, 2 drinks, and an huge selection of condiments--that's a 5/5 anywhere! Dogs really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I think this place is better than hotdog heaven! The choice of meats and the fries are awesome. Recommend this place to anyone passing buy and it's worth going out of your way to go here too. I will come back and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Soggy fries. Hot dogs not very tasty. Won't even consider going back."}
{"text":"After a recent trip to Chicago I've been craving a Chicago-style hot dog. Thought this would hit the spot.  The menu is extensive and there's lots of appetizing stuff. Maybe they have better but I didn't really enjoy my Chicago hot dog. Nothing to it. And missing some ingredients....  No pickle = No Chicago hot dog!!!   Oh and the dining area is pretty dirty, my shoes nearly stuck to the floor and no napkins or silverware in sight.  I think the part that killed me the most was the price. $9 for a hot dog, fries and a Coke? Really? I got the same meal (but better) in a \"cool\" neighborhood in Chicago for $5."}
{"text":"Trying the hush puppies and some things I haven't had before....as always,  great service, great food....just a great local food experience!"}
{"text":"Hotdogs were bomb, service fast and very courteous. Multiple ketchups, BBQ sauces etc to top your dogs off. Great dining experience"}
{"text":"First time here and not a single gripe. Great dogs... onion rings.. tots...it's like this place was built by Christ himself!! I may go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Service was good and very fast. The burgers and hot dogs are amongst the best in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs.  Danielle and I went in on Saturday for National Hot Dog Day. She ordered a Windy City dog, a corn dog and hush puppies.I ordered a Reuben dog, pizzeroni fries and the West Side Polish Boy (mistakenly).  Darn near everything was great. I didn't care too much for the pizzaroni fries as i didn't like the sauce but my dogs were great. unfortunately i messed up and ordered the West Side Polish Boy instead of the East Side but enjoyed the combo of kraut, onions and mustard anyway.  The house made barbecue sauces were really good, especially the apple butter barbecue.   I take away a star and a half because there are no restrooms - i wanted to wash my hands - and because Danielle's Windy City dog had sliced jalapenos on it instead of sport peppers - which aren't the same. i find that ironic as they have a graphic up in the store comparing advertised images of popular fast food sandwiches compared to what you'd actually get and then they have another graphic with all their dogs and the Windy City dog clearly show sport peppers. d'oh!  We're already planning a return to try more dogs and an award winning burger."}
{"text":"Don't judge this little piece of heaven from the outside. It's a true gem among the community and is a great place to enjoy classic American cuisine. Will definitely be returning and recommend everyone who enjoys a ballpark hotdog or a great tasting burger to check them out."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good food. Good service. Great prices. You get lots of bang for your buck. Good for a family with kids.   Both times I went I got hot dogs. All different toppings. Very happy. Hot dogs are great. Toppings generous. Next trip I'm going to try a burger. Fries and tots are good. Large portion no matter what size you get. They even have homemade ketchups. Delish.   Downside are the hours. Close at 7:30. We live east side and after work by the time we get there we cut it close.   Worth the trip though. We will definitely continue to go and try more menu items."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE - I left without even getting my food.  Went in and there were only 4 others there, so not busy.  I waited 15 minutes and my food wasn't ready (simple order of hotdog and fries) because they were waiting on the fries.  I left.  It's lunchtime and they don't have fries readily available???  The four-some in front of me had two people get their food and two waited like me.  Sad that two finished eating before the other two got their food. They use the word 'combo' if you order a hotdog and fries but there is no mention of 'combo' on their signs.  Not sure if it includes a drink or not."}
{"text":"I got an order of the redneck spuds and a perogi burger when I went here,  and the burger turned out to be second best compared to the spuds.   Great food,  great people, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great Ruben dog was fantastic. But then we ordered the fries with cheese, bacon and egg and those were out of this world.  We will be back shortly for more wonderful hot dogs.  Everyone was friendly and I loved reading all the hot dog facts on the wall. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"On my way to buy a comforter set off Craigslist, I see The Hotdog Diner. Gotta try this!  I had a slaw dog w Swiss cheese w a Snappy hotdog, small fry, and a Coke. Hotdog, Cole slaw, thin natural fries all yummy. And not only do they have Coke - yay - they have Pepsi as well!  It will take a couple of minutes to figure out the menu but the cashiers will guide you through. Wish it were closer to home but when I am close, I will stop by!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Northeast Ohio...Best dogs ever.  The place is small, but the food is a huge hit.  Always stop by for lunch when in the area for work."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years now, and it hasn't gotten old once. There's so much to try! I could probably come back every week for a year and not try all the combinations on the menu! Love that variety! And its so hard too because EVERYTHING is good here! I suggest the onion rings.   The thing I really like about this place is that if, it isn't on the menu, ask and they will make it for you! You want a fried egg on your burger? Done! You wanna add some O-rings to your hotdog? SHAZZAM! Why is this a big deal? Because I've been to other so called diners that get really haughty about you customizing your own food. Plus they've been adding a lot of new stuff lately, like fried perogies with sour cream and cheese, and meat balls. I heard a rumor about them adding mac and cheese to the menu! A yelpette can only dream...   Everyone is really friendly too. They'll greet you by name and they'll even remember your usual order if you come in often enough. Its really great when a business takes the time to get to know the customers.   Seating is good too. I've never had issues getting a seat. They even have a picnic table outside for the 1 day a year the weather is nice! The only thing is that, because it was an old taco bell, there's no bathrooms. So plan ahead!   Overall, definitely go. There's something for everyone!  Edit:   I forgot to mention that I've never been charged for extra toppings. I have no Idea what the other guy is talking about."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a good hot dog spot. I came across this after looking up spots on the internet. The Chilli dog is amazing. I wish there was a tad more sauce on it. Also purchased a burger that I intend on eating for dinner.  I will definitely go back in the near future."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's got a really great dive feel, but it is sooooo good. DEFINITELY have the loaded potato burger! fries & sour cream and onions and bacon on top of a burger?!? It's a must."}
{"text":"First timer! Loved it. And the owners are so sweet! Had the Looney Laney and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Lots of sauces and a pretty cool atmosphere. The staff are always very upbeat and friendly. They also offer a lot of different kinds of hot dogs. Fun place for kids."}
{"text":"Local favorite! Decided to break my diet and give this one a whirl, went around lunchtime; it was packed. Locals know this spot for sure, you walk in and the scent of fresh fries hits you in the nostrils like a ton of bricks! It is an old Taco Bell do the inside is a bit small, probably only 8 tables at the most. They have a small menu, straight forward and to the point, prices are great! We had pizzaroni fries with a classic bacon cheeseburger and neither selection disappointed!   Their fries are sooooo good, dip them in the homemade bbq sauces they have available for an incredible treat! I'll definitely be back to try their pulled pork and their gyros, I left food and completely satisfied! Only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because I was hoping they would have buffalo wings and their service was a bit rude."}
{"text":"This place it's a hidden gem! I was not expecting the quality we got. Everything was fresh, and delicious. Don't be fooled by the fact that they serve hot dogs, the hush puppies were amazing. They were crunchy, moist and perfectly seasoned.   I got the Reuben dog and it was great. My fiance got the \"tylers special\" it was piled high with fresh cut fries and smothered in cheese sauce! We also got onion rings. They were battered and fried crisp. Perfectly done.   I highly recommend this fun and unique spot."}
{"text":"Food is average. We had the Gyro, the menu states that it's cut from the cone which it is not! It was a bit greasy. The table we sat was sticky but the whole dining area was a bit dirty. When I see places like that I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. My friend had a chili dog and stated it was good. If cleanliness isn't important to you then give this hole a try."}
{"text":"Some of the ingredients may lack a certain pizzaz, but overall, the quality of the food is pretty good. They have a vast array of 'gourmet' hot dogs and burgers, which are really just a theme of similar toppings on a hot dog or burger. The only possible downside to the gourmet dogs is the amount of toppings, which can easily be bigger than the actual dog. I personally don't mind (the more the merrier), but this might be a deal breaker for some. The regular hot dogs aren't anything to rave about, so you'll need to get a 'snappy' dog if you want to taste something different. Great-tasting festival style french fries, in large portions. The staff is always cordial every time I've visited. Orders are ready fairly quickly. The prices are fairly cheap for a local fast food-ish eatery. $2.49 can get you any of the gourmet dogs, 2.99 for a snappy gourmet dogs. They also have 1/4 lb gourmet dogs for $3.89. All of the burgers and sandwiches are under $5."}
{"text":"So many different choices and honestly good food. So glad I listened to the other reviews. Try it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place even though I don't  order the hotdogs here. First experience was with the burger that was so tasty I can't be motivated to move off the burger menu yet. The fries are cooked to order and arrive hot and cooked to perfection.  I'll update after I find the courage to go cold turkey from these superb burgers! The owner has been here every time that I stopped and is very friendly and service-oriented.  They make it very  hard to pass this place by."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here regularly. The owner is so welcoming and personable, and the service is always friendly and prompt. The menu has so many great choices. My \"usuals\" are either the loaded potato burger, the panini dog, or the wagon train dog...along with some fresh cut fries, of course! There are \"snappy\" dogs in a natural casing, and jumbo all-beef dogs, both of which are delicious. Tons of different ketchups, mustards, and barbecue sauces that they make in house, too! They're starting to be recognized in the local media and for good reason. Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to come for a quick bit. It is better than fast food and would give lots of table.service places a run for their money I am sure. My wife and I each got a burger. She had a \"regular\" one...lettuce tomatoes etc...I got a western type burger and both were good. The meat was very good and cooked perfectly. It is very comfy inside and has a great hot dog, America, ball park fell to it. We will definitely go back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I love a good hot dog and this place has good hot dogs!!! I can't resist shack like food joints. Don't let the outside send you away, there is some great food and a cool unique place inside.  I got the jumbo dog, holy juicy, meaty, heaven! It was hot and flavorful. The staff was friendly, young adults. I have to go back and try their burgers and other fun stuff, fries look awesome!   Went back and tried the burger, I prefer the hot dogs. Burger might have been good if the bun wasn't so big and the patty was as big as the bun, nothing I hate more than a bite of all bun. maybe I'll give the burger another try another day. Until then, it's hot dogs for me!"}
{"text":"There is a drive up window and a picnic bench for eating outside. Service is quite fast considering the variety of food. For $8.99, I got a small cup of coleslaw, one small piece of deep fried fish, three deep fried potato pierogi which included a small container of sour cream, and an abundant amount of french fries. I would have preferred my fish not deep fried, nor the pierogi deep fried. For the price, I would have liked two pieces of broiled fish and boiled and lightly fried pierogi, and fewer fries; it would also have been nice if the food container was placed in a bag with plastic utensils and napkins, since I had ordered take out. When I scanned the place for napkins, all I noticed was the station to return the dirty food baskets and the station with the ketchup and mustard. The restaurant was busy and almost all seats were occupied at about 1:15 p.m.. I did enjoy the food, just would have preferred what I posted above in view of the cost, plus I left $1 in the tip cup."}
{"text":"I've been to The Hot Dog Diner several times. We often order from here for lunch at work. You can't go wrong here. Everything is always fresh and tastes great. The owners are as nice as they come. They will do whatever it takes to make sure every customer is happy. It's crazy to me that people still go to fast food joints when you can go here for real burgers and dogs. I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all good. $6 here and I'm full, $6 at the fast food chains isn't enough and doesn't last long in me. (if you know what i mean) The burgers are made daily from fresh meat and are fantastic. The dogs are great as well. Saturday we ordered the 5 dogs for $5, two burgers, a hot dog combo and a side of fries and it was under $20!  You can't go wrong here. Check them out next time you need a quick bite to eat and support a local small business!"}
{"text":"I had super high expectations for this place. I mean come on....a place that has dedicated its existence to the humble tube of meat that we Americans call a hot dog needs to get it right. Exactly right.   If you are looking for a frilly place that has an awesome design and a put together feel, this wouldn't be the best place to stop. Set inside an old Taco Bell, you feel like you should be ordering a bean burrito and some cinnamon twists. They didn't really do much to update the place from the heyday? of the Bell that used to be here. But, this is a mom and pop shop folks, so get over it!  I ordered The Hillbilly Dog and the Parm Garlic Fries. Let me start off by giving you the positives of the food. I absolutely love the 12+ selections of catsup and mustard they offer. From chipotle mustard to sweet caroline? BBQ sauce, they are all really really good. I must've tried 75% of these homemade sauces and liked every single one. Their coleslaw is ordinary but in a good way. Brings you back to picnic time at the family reunion. And their chili? I really really liked it.....just the right amount of spices and flavor and not pureed like some places.  For my hotdog base I got the polish dog....and was far from impressed. Boiled polish hotdogs are gross. Well, boiled hot dogs in general are gross. But polish hot dogs need to be grilled. So, the supposed star of the show instantly took a nose dive. Luckily, the coleslaw and chili were there to save the little weiners life. Plus, I got to test out the plethora of sauces offered to cover up the dogs not so desireable flavor.   The fries? BOMB DOT COM! A little too much parm garlic butter, but tasty nonetheless. The flavor here is on point....but they definitely need to up the portion size here. $5 for a side of fries need to come out in a huge basket.   Overall, I didn't dislike this place by any means. But, next time I think I would get a burger and tell them I wanted more fries with less sauce. So much for a killer dog :("}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing compared to Steve hotdog inn on Lorain in Cleveland though. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I just did not think this place was everything that everyone else thought."}
{"text":"What a cool little place. It has a little bit of everything. Dogs, gyros, hush puppies; you name it!   The place is a little tucked away but its own building. It has a fun kind of small shop look and feel. And the main guy is very personable. Always a plus.  The food isn't going to knock your socks off but it is really good for the crazy low prices. The hot dogs are cool and have fun toppings but the gyros are really good and huge! The hush puppies were not too bad either. All in all, a great place for an even better price. A perfect neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Great variety of toppings for hot dogs!! Make sure you get the loaded tots! Great service and 100% all beef hotdogs."}
{"text":"I think it's only appropriate to preface my review by saying I'm generally not a big fan of the wiener. I play for the other team (by that I mean burgers). However, sometimes nothing will hit the spot like a great hot dog. Now I'm not actually sure that I've ever had a really GREAT hot dog like the ones people always talk about in NYC or places like that but I think I have a good handle on what I would consider a good dog if I ever found one.  The Hot Dog Diner gets close. Not quite incredible but is on the right track. Their ideas and specialty hot dogs are very original and taste pretty dang good. My gripe is the actual meat between the buns. Perhaps my perception is off  but it seems to me that they aren't using the most high quality wieners. They're also not as big as I expected. I prefer larger, heartier links. Now to be fair, the prices are reflective of their smaller dogs but I would pay more for a real, better quality sausage.  My kids loved the place and I thought it was pretty good for what it was. It's a hot dog so I wasn't expecting an orgasmic culinary experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice now in the past couple months, first two times ever. The first time I had two dogs, one was called the snappy dog and the was the sauerkraut dog both were amazing. Today I went for my birthday with my dad and we both had gotten? gyros, I had the Chipotle gyro amazing as well but to much meat compared to the pita. Dad had gotten the classic. We also had the Parma fries, garlic parmesan... yum."}
{"text":"I was down in the pits, yo, working as a MINER Dreaming I could someday be a Frisco 49ER Then I hit the night job at the oil REFINER (y) And then went to my crib to sleep in the RECLINER  Next day I'm awoken by a jet AIRLINER And a girl walks by and she couldn't be FINER She's dressed so sexy and her shoes are DESIGNER And I really love the way she did her EYELINER  So I head out to the street, and I ask her for the TIMER She recognizes me from Yelp and she asks me to SIGN HER In a place that'd get me busted if she was a MINOR I can't tell you where but it's near her PANTY LINER  She said she had a boyfriend who was a TWO-TIMER So I paid him a visit and he somehow got a SHINER Long story short, I was able to RE-ALIGN HER We lay under the stars and I showed her URSA MINOR  We sailed around the world on a luxury LINER She's too good for words, there are none that can DEFINE HER She's chill, which is great, because I can be a WHINER And we're both obsessed with the HOT DOG DINER  BOOM  OK, that wasn't very good. But this is (pulls down pants)  The Hot Dog Diner is one of the most innovative, imaginative, and outlandish Hot Dog and Burger joints you'll ever visit. It doesn't look like much, but the menu is extremely ambitious. This is one of those places where the food reflects the character of the man who invents it. This guy is Crazy Dave.  I can't really describe Crazy Dave, so I'll just show you his picture https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hot-dog-diner-parma?select=symLUfBwKefM_rF-eBnQyQ  I think you can tell from one look at him, that he's going to make you some amazing burgers and dogs. My go-to is the Chicago Dog, which although it isn't the best I've had, it's the best I've had in Ohio, and is certainly worth a try despite not being quite like the ones in Chi-town or Pitt for that matter.  The burgers are monstrous and imaginative and very tasty. I'd give the place 5 stars for the burger alone, or the Chicago dog alone, but when you combine these items and all the other Crazy Dave concoctions, you're left with a definitive five star legend which should be a lot more popular than it is - but is doing fine nevertheless, and never seems empty.  Not to mention the fact that Dave is a very intelligent man, who knows a lot about all kinds of food, and is a really nice guy to talk to. He deserves all the success he gets, and both he and this food deserve this glowing 5 star endorsement from the most annoying guy on Yelp.  And speaking of dogs, what is the question that really makes a dyslexic agnostic person think?  \"Is there really a Dog?\""}
{"text":"Used to love it, but something must have changed. The quality of hot dog is not as good as when it first opened."}
{"text":"The Hot Dog Diner is a must for unique burgers and dogs! The options are great! If Guy Fieri came to Parma...he should try the food at Hot Dog Diner!"}
{"text":"One might say I have a weakness for hot dogs. Ok that is an understatement as I eat about 5# worth a month. So naturally I would eventually end up here.  The building is one of the original style Taco Bells. Y'know those ones from the late 80s? It's surprisingly well kept. Anyhow for those that recall ordering in those ones will have a flashback here, because the order/pickup is exactly the same. /end nostalgia  The owners are quite possibly the nicest people I have ever met. Seriously, they make you feel like family.  I got the snappy windy city dogs. Got to love neon anything on food. They were very good with just the right amount of peppers. The hush puppies were ok. I should have probably gotten them without the cheese and chili, so that could be my mistake. Don't get me wrong, they were still good. Chili and cheese enhances everything.  Note: the website does not list the entire menu. They have grilled cheese and several other versions of hot dogs, like a rueben one."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers posted here. This is a fun little diner, with very friendly people, and good tasting food. I enjoyed the slaw dog (tasty coleslaw) and the windy city dog (very pickley relish); and also had a side cheesy fries. The potato skin burger was good too, or so I am told. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in and was a bit overwhelmed by the many choices! Staff was patient and friendly while I figured out what to get.   -Two chili cheese dogs with onions. Apparently these were different kinds of wiener (traditional  $2.44 and snappy $3.69) but they tasted the same to both of us. Very simple. Soft bun. Not bad at all, but nothing special.  - Redneck Super Spuds $6.99. Loaded fresh cut fries with pulled pork, cheese, and coleslaw. Warning that these come salted unless you ask otherwise. It's a mess, but a very tasty one. We both really enjoyed this and it's a huge portion.  - Pierogie burger $4.99. I liked this one so much I did not share. Even ate half of it cold the next day. Nice sized pierogie, onions, good meat to buttery bun ratio.   Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty busy so seemed like a popular place. Liked that they have a table full of different homemade sauces like garlic ketchup or applebutter BBQ. They also have a dollar off the super fries when you check in with Yelp. I would go back for more burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! We were the only ones dining in and were a little on the loud side because we were joking around and having a good time- kinda like a bar, but different, lol. My son got the farmer burger and tore it up like no one's business! He also got a chili dog, even though he doesn't like hot dogs. I ordered my go-to dog, which is a Chicago. The bun didn't hold up to it as well as I would have liked, but if it were denser or heavier, it may have been too much. We loved their variety of ketchup, mustard, and barbecue sauces. The garlic ketchup paired nicely with the Parmesan garlic fries like red wine and cheese. The owner was there and came out and chatted with us. We laughed and had a great time! I will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  There's really not many hot dog places around so this place fills the void.  If you don't like dogs then get one of the many burgers they make too.  All fresh from the fries to the burgers. As for hot dogs, get a \"snappy\" dog for sure, topped with whatever you want.  So good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed Hot dogs not done enough or of quality grade meat for me. My search for the perfect Hot Dog / Polish Boy continues."}
{"text":"Have been here many times, is consistently good. Staff always friendly, patient with complicated orders, very quick service. Despite several menu changes, the food quality has remained great, even though they tweaked the classic Chicago dog-and being from the Chicagoland area that is very disappointing to me. Tried the new grilled cheese menu last time I was there and it was great-lots of options. Maybe take one of the bread selections away in exchange for tomatoes back on the Chicago dog!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter stopped by for lunch. Paced our order, fries came out soggy, hot dogs were cold. Asked to have them warmed up or replaced and we were sent to our table. Service if you want to call it was horrible and the food was no better. I don't think we Wil ever try this place again"}
{"text":"$34 for a family of 5 -- can't beat it! The burgers and fries were delicious -- definately the way to go. My boys gobbled up the dogs and the chicken sandwich was ok."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area and were intrigued. I'm so glad that we stopped! The service was quick and friendly and the hot dogs were perfect! I had the all beef and they were delicious. He tried the porky pig and said it was delicious. We shared an order of fries. It was certainly enough for two people. I'd make a special trip back here when I'm craving hot dogs again. Better than happy dog in university circle."}
{"text":"I've only eaten hear once so far but I do plan on going back for the interesting looking burgers. I forgot the names of the dogs but one was I think the New York one with the works, one was essentially a chili dog with onions sour cream and cheese, and the other had some jalapenos and stuff on it. Not bad but when I was eating them I just kept thinking of how much better this meal would have tasted had I just  bought some ingredients and grilled some dogs myself at home. There's no magic at the Hot Dog Diner and it is what it is. Plain old dogs with lots of toppings piled high. Good solution for a lazy day."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our road trip thanks to Yelp. I had the BLT Gyro and it was awesome. The fries are just the way I like them and everyone else loved their food. Too bad it's not in my neighborhood. That may be good for my health."}
{"text":"What's up with these random-ass awesome places in Parma? The Hot Dog Diner is no fine dining establishment, but it is a damn-near perfect place to get grub. As the name of the restaurant says, they serve mainly hot dogs, hamburgers and loaded fries. But make sure to check out their Web site before you go, as they literally have dozens of different \"gourmet\" hot-dog choices.  My friends and I stared at the choices like idiots for about 15 minutes deciding what to get. In short, this place is great. Seacrest out."}
{"text":"Only average at best. I like coney dogs so that is what I ordered. The coney sauce is on the sweet side. Nothing special about it that would make me want to go back again. The hand cut fries were awful. They did not look or taste fresh. I won't  be going back."}
{"text":"Nice place for good dogs!  Lots of interesting selections for the hot dogs and it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch with my wife. Took awhile to order because there so much to choose from. Got a two hot dogs and split a breakfast burger with my wife. The hot dogs were awesome, high quality and the breakfast burger with the fried egg and bacon on top is on of the best burgers I have had. The bun was kind of tasted like a Hawaiian roll"}
{"text":"Great choice in toppings. 4 types of dogs to load up with toppings. I loved the classic and snappy. I don't like relish but I loved the Windy City dog with neon green relish. Can't wait to try their award winning burgers."}
{"text":"This place has a HUGE menu. Came with a party of 8 and tried just about everything. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as it seemed. The menu items were highly superficial. The Cajun Fries were probably the worst thing we had. The cheese sauce tasted almost like paste. Had a couple milkshakes, nothing special."}
{"text":"not as good as it looks compared to quality of the food compared to other hot dog places in the area. rumor has it they cook stuff ahead of time and leave it in warmers overnight which is not good. I like fresh quality food and all beef hotdogs not the chicken/pork hotdogs they sell, better off making your own or going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is awesome! If I get the hot dogs, I always go with the snappy dog then choose my toppings! Yum!"}
{"text":"This establishment is not the best building but inside it is very well setup and it has a very large variety of different things on the menu. I got two dogs and a burger. And they were very well prepared and I recommend this to anyone who is feeling a hot dog or burger."}
{"text":"I have ate my fair share of hot dogs and burgers in my day and this hands down is the best bang for the buck you will find and also the best regardless of price.  The burgers are simple and delicious and the hot dogs are right up there with Happy Dog in Cleveland or O'Betty's in Athens.  I recently had the chicken sandwich and it was great also.  The fries are fantastic as well and if you factor in the fries I would put it above In N Out as the best burger and fries for the money anywhere!"}
{"text":"This place seriously rocks. They're food is BOMB and the service is awesome! I got a chicken sandwich, my boyfriend split a side of fries, and he got two hotdogs. We got a helping of fries to serve FOUR people. You get MORE than your money's worth. The people are SO friendly as stated before. It's just so nice to see a local business run things the way they should be. You get your money's worth, the food is delicious and the people make you feel at home.   Would go back ANY day!!! Plenty of parking and they accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"The hotdogs were pretty tasty and the buns were very soft. We also had a grilled cheese with smoked gouda and provolone on Texas toast. The hush puppies were made to order, hot and crispy."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Both the hot dogs and the burgers are to die for, as are the fresh cut fries!!  Excellent service, great variety and creativity in the menu, and great price!  One of our favorite local haunts.  Very inventive menu and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hot dog shop. Every hot dog I got was so artfully prepared!  I was impressed with the wide variety of hot dog toppings and combinations. I got the snappy (natural casing) dogs which is def the way to go. My husband got the panini and I got the hillbilly dog. We both got Chicago dogs too, but this leads me to why this place only gets 4 stars.  It wasn't authentic and if you have had one in Chicago, you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"I took my buddy to Hot Dog Diner for lunch today to try him somethin' new.  Today, we were in the mood for dogs, so I got a Chicago Dog and a Hillbilly Dog.  Now that I've been to Chicago and enjoyed a real Chicago Dog, I have a basis for comparison.    No, the Hot Dog Diner's Chicago Dog did not live up to my expectations, but it was okay.  I don't really remember it having any flavor, to be honest.  The tomatoes were there, but they had no flavor.  The pickle had flavor, but that was about all.  They should swap the onions for sweet peppers.  The Hillbilly Dog was delicious.  The chili was yummy and the slaw was done right.   This is my favorite hot dog so far, me thinks.  My buddy Nik also had a Chicago dog, but he had a different dog as well, which I can't remember because it was gone before I could say, 'how's that dog?'  He liked it and he wants to go back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is located in an old Taco Bell. It's very quaint and casual. They serve other items besides hotdogs like gyros and burgers, but you really should get a hotdog. They have a lot of hot dog styles to choose from but I recommend getting 5 \"doozy\" dogs for $5, and you have to get 5 to score this deal. The doozy is a simple dog with ketchup, mustard, onion and relish. They are quite good, and a great price.  If you want to use the restroom, you'll have to walk through a section of their kitchen. That was the only real negative about this place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Hillbilly french fries are the bomb!!!! Lil pricey but you do get a lot of food. Very friendly staff and the food always comes out quick. Great comfort food!!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, fries, burgers, etc.  very fairly priced, excellent, friendly, funny service!! They have deals all the time on Facebook.  It's fun to just read the wiener signs!! Yummy shakes too, & they also have chicken & gyros, which also look great,, but I have not yet tried!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are amazing but the burgers!!!  To die for!!!  The western is soo good. Fries are really yummy as well"}
{"text":"The creative menu makes it hard to pick just one item, so I have to try a few.  I started with the Snappy Chili Cheese Dog, it works for what it is but nothing special. I think a dip in the deep fried would have made it, but I didn't feel like paying extra for a grease bath. Then came the chili cheese hush puppies. Once again it meets the definition. Okay hush puppies with okay chili. Finally I had to try the award winning Perogie Burger. The Perogie was good, I wish I would have order them alone, but the burger got lost in the mix. The dominating flavor was American cheese slice with a background of grilled onions. They offer a wide selection of ketchup, BBQ, and mustard sauces. Garlic ketchup was really good and the apple butter BBQ sauce was interesting. Overall, it was good but it has left me venturing out to other establishments when I am in town."}
{"text":"I usually don't like hot dogs, but this place is good.  Also the fries are great!  I definitely want to try their burgers next time because I heard those are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Drove up around 11:30 a.m. on a weekday and it was deserted. Walk in and, based on Yelp reviews, order a couple of snappys -- a sauerkraut and a Chicago (now renamed the Windy City) plus fries and a drink.  Guy overfills the cup with the drink and just swipes the back of his hand over it before giving it to me, so I've got to grab some napkins to wipe it down.  The dogs come out and I see why they've renamed it the Windy City -- they've removed half the toppings. Now it's just neon relish (but not tasting like the real thing), a ton of onions, mustard and three or four sport peppers. Great. The sport peppers they keep -- the one thing most Chicagoans skip -- but they dump the tomatos, pickle spear and celery salt.  The sauerkraut dog is worse. I've never seen two-tone kraut before; don't know why some of it was a darker brown than the rest. But it was just kraut and even more onions and mustard.  The snappys are snappy, but not very tasty. Only when another guy came in while I was eating did I learn that they're the smallest dogs on the menu; the quarter-pounders are all beef and might have been a better choice.  The fries were so-so -- not crispy enough, but not too greasy.  Unless I missed something, they either have no restrooms or have them hidden behind a door with a combination lock.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"So... burgers are kind of my thing. I just love a good burger.    I walked in to try it out one night with my girlfriend. Holy cow. This place is amazing.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  I've eaten here a handful of times, every time I try to eat something new, I've yet to try something I didn't like.  I can't remember what the menu item was called, but it was a basket of fries with an egg on top..........ugh... so good. I had two different burgers, both were amazing.    I really have high hopes for this place. I hope they can make it work.  They really are a diamond in the rough.  Also, the custom ketchup and mustard flavors they have are quite good, and a fun way to add additional flavor to your meal. Friendly people, reasonable prices, awesome food.  Definitely give them a shot of you like a good burger."}
{"text":"First time at the diner. Brought my wife and her 97 y/o mother for lunch. WOW what a find! Burgers were so large and fresh made.  Shared a large fries, could see why they were a people's choice in the area's best fries contest.  Owners were super friendly. We'll definitely be back. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I got the Onion Rings and the 'Shroom Burger. Everything was perfectly cooked. The onion rings had whole slices of onions and were nicely fried without being greasy.  The burger had onions, mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. Simply delicious.  It is a quaint place, clean and simple."}
{"text":"Have been here twice over the last week since I moved into the area.  The burgers are pretty good - they say that they are ground up each day, and considering how it melted apart, I believed it.  Tried both the chili dog and the cowboy dog and they are definitely keepers as well.  Had a good snap to them, and left me wanting more.  Also, they have a surprising array of milkshakes - I tried a pumpkin pie one which is pretty good.  The only reason it gets a star dinged off is because of the fries.  If someplace has hot dog and burgers, their fries better be good, but they are awful.  The fries are overcooked, and remind me of the super brown potato chips at the bottom of the bag.  I thought maybe I just had a bad batch the first time, but the second time was more of the same.  Would definitely recommend, just not the fries."}
