{"text":"Best dinner ever i be ever had, some delicious chicken fingers they where absolutely lovely"}
{"text":"Great food, good value. We've eaten here many times and its always consistent. Good hot food and friendly service. Special shout out to the deep fried mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Another amazing rib dinner! Never fails to make me happy! Thanks JENN! If you are anywhere near this restaurant do yourself a favour and drop in, you won't be disappointed. (Amazing deserts too)"}
{"text":"Love the theme!! Feels like you're back in the 50s/60s, they have these cute little juke boxes at each booth that you can pay to play a song over the resteraunt speakers. Quick service and really good food!"}
{"text":"I really like this diner style pub, the food is always great! I usually meet my kids here for lunch but this time tried dinner, wow! Excellent and amazing friendly service. They have weekday specials and I hear live music at times"}
{"text":"The food was amazing ordered onion soup lots if cheese and came hot i also had the pizza grilled cheese it was amazing  and large portions the only problem i had was we sat at the bar and the manager we later found out stood in front of us refused to look at us to take our order very unfriendly!!!! We had to ask the server who was very busy he helped everyone except us was very unimpressed!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, great food, nice staff and excellent prices.  The Club House Sandwich was awesome"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is pretty meh. It is nothing special.  The decor is really nice but the 50's feeling ends there. The food is nothing like you would find in a real 50's diner. The menu felt more like a Kelsey's or something like that. Burgers with weird toppings and all.  I had a Poutine but they had no regular Poutine, again just weird toppings that don't taste very good together.  Definitly not coming back here."}
{"text":"Heading out for a late night bite, my man and I stopped into Melanie Pringles. A staple of Whitby, it's got something for everyone at great prices. It's a 50's/60's style restaurant with a nice patio. Their website is complete with their whole menu and a small clip of the seating area. The servers are polite, quick and patient to their indecisive customers, like us.   We finally decided on Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Club Penne Bake...not to mention the Crispy Crunch Milkshake and the Root Beer Float! My man definitely forgot what happens when you drop ice cream in pop! Hahahaha! The float made him feel like a kid again! They have AMAZING milkshakes, made with ice cream and very thick.   The chicken penne was great. It had everything a club sandwich has, but pasta instead of bread! Cheesy and chickeny; it was delicious. This dish had a lot going on, but it was pretty good. It was even good the next day!   The fajitas were also very tasty. There was lots of tender chicken accompanied by sweet onions, red and green peppers. He had to ask for more tortillas, but there were ample toppings. Who am I kidding? There's never enough cheese!   Melanie Pringles has been around for a long time. It's family friendly and beer friendly. With a great oldies atmosphere and great food to match you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Um - first - about the \"food\" ....... they tagged it as \"Chicken Parmesan\" ........ the \"chicken was disgusting, not a chicken breast, as you may expect & desire, nope; instead, it was a pre frozen, nuked, mechanically molested hunk of sludge with the consistency of a firm tofu; or month old pudding; covered in canned red sauce & processed cheese. Also on same plate, was, what I guess, a penne pasta covered in an unpleasant & strong smelly liquid  pool of goo.The very worst food I've ever came across..... EVER. - bar none. - Now, as for \"the theme\" of this joint, well,  it makes no sense at all, for anyone with a brain. ..... ya, they might pump the old tunes through the place, but that's where the vibe ends.The decor is a wanabee attempt at cool; just a bunch of props scattered about the room, no real thought went into it, the result : a big yawn. Our \"waiter\",  um .....  \"Fonzie\" .... wise cracked that I should be named his name, ( for wearing a black leather jacket ) ; guess what - some customers might not like being insulted, with idiotic jabs- I didn't find his \"joke\" funny in any way . I happen to love cooking myself & am pretty sure that I know what good food should be like, this was BAD FOOD..... With the chicken being the way it is, I don't even want to think what the rest of thier \"menu\" is like. I also happen to be a serious Mid Century collector,in this department, they've stuck a 57 Chev on the wall for some dumb reason & slapped up a few Marilyn pictures, real thrilling. ( Wow, I actually thought I was travelling back in the 50's - NOT. This dump strikes out on all counts- it only exists due to a bar, tasteless patrons, the confused; &  the clueless. They should rename it \" Crappy Daze\"."}
{"text":"Very nice, 1950s style diner.  The food is delicious, the service is great and the atmosphere is great too!  A great family restaurant featuring everything from a salad bar, popcorn, blue plate specials to ribs and burgers."}
{"text":"It's ok if you like bad music and bland food. Great for old people!! Soup was like water and my salad tastes like it was swimming in water. I think it could have potential but not this time."}
{"text":"Do you remember dining at a restaurant that brought upon nostalgia of a time you never experienced before. Somewhere that connected past and present seamlessly, making it magical? Melanie Pringle's is an example of that special place that not only transports you to an incredible time, but does so through it's food in a big way.  Nothing but great reviews through word of mouth, that's when you know you have to go without question. I didn't have to think twice or yelp this place before heading over. I expected a pub or bar style family restaurant, the type with dirty carpet, a wooden bar, stools and wooden tables for four. Oh man, I was wrong.  My first impression was that the restaurant was big, that the arcade games in front were an amazing addition, and that the place was like it came straight out of the 70s. Retro-style booths and neon lights. Hints of Miami-esque colors and waitresses in uniform to match.   But what blew my socks off was the food. It's a diner serving insane diner food! I had such a hard time choosing what I wanted, they had everything. Classics like meat loaf, Rubens, nachos, wings, burgers, etc. to cool signature dishes like the the bacon double cheeseburger springrolls or the crispy peameal fritter club. I ordered this sandwich from recommendation and I kid you not- it's one of the top 3 sandwiches I've ever had. Peameal Bacon coated with Dill Pickle chips, turkey, chedder, lettuce, tomato, with pesto mayo. How does not peak your foodie interest?  I also tried the ribs and had one of their specialty drinks called the forbidden fruit. I liked the drink a lot, reminiscent of an apple jolly rancher with strong natural kiwi bites, even though it didn't have kiwi in it.  Overall, this was an amazing restaurant that serves an amazing variety of food, all done amazingly well with great service and prices. Atmosphere can't be beat and you just gotta try the Fritter club sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! Love that kids eat free on Sunday's!  Good food, good service! Reliably good meal!"}
{"text":"My parents and I went here for lunch today, and we were very impressed with the quality of service and food. I ordered the chicken BLT, and my parents both got the traditional burger (by the server's recommendation). Our meal was served faster than expected, and it tasted wonderful. Everything is also quite fairly priced, and they have really good daily deals we will want to plan around in the future.   We will definitely be back again. The old 50s-60's theme looks cool, and the food tastes great. I definitely recommend both the traditional burger and the chicken BLT!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go! I wish they would advertise it more, almost no one I speak to knows about it. Its great for any age, great selection of food and the decor gives you that true diner vibe. Would 100% recommend, as long as you're not looking for anything too fancy. The Newfoundland poutine is my go to. The portions are large so be prepared to bring stuff home or share with a friend :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past with very great service, tonight was an exception. There were 2 staff working and I sat with an empty beer for 20 mins while 1 made a personal call and the other walked around like he was the owner. They both looked at me several times, ignoring the face that I didn't have a drink. Too bad. I used to like this place"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, a little over priced for what you get. Food was good, not great. Will return again some time, but not soon"}
{"text":"WEnt for a lunch - great burgers, awsome shakes."}
{"text":"We love this place for what it is, a quick and satisfying diner. Good selection of food including options for kids, friendly staff, and reasonable price points. The atmosphere is old school and the service is quick. Also special deals make it attractive if you have kids."}
{"text":"Ive been a server at various restaurants for six years. I came into Melanie Pringles on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't that busy. I was seated almost right away. After I was seated I waited almost 10 minutes (if at 10 minutes nothing happened I would have left). After 8 minutes I stopped one of the girls working and asked if my server was coming. She got her and my server came quickly and asked what I would like. I ordered water and potato skins. The water came quite quickly and about 10 minutes later the potato skins came. They were cooked perfectly. She came by a few minutes later and asked how everything was. I told her it was great. After I finished I put the plate to the side. When she came to grab it I asked her about the size of the cheesecake and she explained it. I ordered it and it came not too long after. Was amazing. Paid bill and I left. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my wife there.  Really enjoyed the experience.  I've eaten there years ago, but my wife is new to the area.  She wants back!  The fries and shakes are pretty good!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Melanie Pringles that was in Pickering all the time when I was in high school, so when my birthday rolled around, I opted for nostalgia and picked Melanie Pringles as my choice for lunch. This location is right near Thickson and Dundas, tucked away in the corner of the plaza.  One of the draws to Melanie Pringles is that they have all kinds of stuff on the walls and it feels like you're walking into a 1950s diner. Each table has its own little jukebox which (for 0.25) you can play oldies songs right at your table. They have the cool sparkle vinyl seats and the matching rounded off tables. You'll spend a few minutes just looking around.  Also worth noting, this is generally considered (in my humble opinion) a greasy spoon that's got a pretty facade on it. All of the food is diner style, not much is healthy and its where you should go for those homemade greasy comfort foods we all love so much.  We ended up trying out one of the trio platters that had mozzarella sticks, pizza sticks and wings on it and I got the chicken and cheese melt on garlic bread with lattice fries (for an extra $2!). The mozzarella sticks  here are probably some of the best I've had. They're not totally mozzarella but they're really super stringy and melty! The Pizza sticks were alright, too much pepperoni so they weren't really all that well balanced. But the wings! Wow! Was pretty damned impressed with the wings here, really big, well sauced and lots of tasty meat on them.  My chicken and cheese melt was good, the garlic bread was what made the sandwich so  yum. The lattice fries were a treat, as I can't find them anywhere anymore, but paying $2 extra for them seemed unreasonable. I would get them again, but only because I'm obsessed with those particular kind of fries.  The service was so so, nothing to write home about. Our server seemed like she was on autopilot for the entire time we were there. The place got pretty busy for a Friday lunch though, lots of people in there, so clearly this place does well.  Overall, not a bad joint to stop in for some greasy spoon food. We'll be going back to try a few other things off the menu (and probably to get some more of those wings) and to see what else they've got going for them."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here, and we will definitely be back! Prices are ok, but food is fantastic! Waitstaff is very friendly and attentive.  The first time we were here, the waitress got our wing order mixed up, but she fixed it right away, and with a smile. She was so apologetic and sweet, so we didn't even mind.  This time, I had the shrimp tacos and was quite impressed. Hubby had the peameal fritter club sandwich and loved it. It came on a huge mound of fries. He always finishes everything, and despite being hungry, even he couldn't finish. Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Cold fries, bland burgers and surly attitude when you complain. Service is slow and non-attentive. On the positive, there's free popcorn to help yourself to whilst you're waiting for your food to arrive. You'll need it."}
{"text":"Meh. I've been here a couple of times in the past few months. Good atmosphere, nice staff but the food isn't awesome....perhaps I'm ordering the wrong stuff?  I don't think that there should be any items on a menu though that are compromises when it comes to quality.  The Cobb salad I had wasn't bad but the \"mixed greens\" I was expecting ended up being chopped romaine and overall it rated a \"fine\" for quality. Like not complaining but not recommending. The last time we went I think it was a \"California Club\" sandwich that I had....if you're tempted to order it....just don't. Easier to say that then explain where this sandwich failed me :("}
