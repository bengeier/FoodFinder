{"text":"This was my first experience at Caplansky's deli on a Sunday late morning. It's a great location in Little Italy and inside has a nice dining room area with tables outside as well. 

I was greeted by the staff who were quite friendly. I ordered the smoked meat sandwich which I have to say is the best smoked meat sandwich I have had in this city! I am definitely a fan and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Lunch time with a friend on Saturday. Brisket on a bun was greasy. Friends smoked turkey was dry as a bone and stringy. The service was godd, hence the 2 stars. IMO the menu is too large. If you want to serve great deli, focus on that. I won't be back. It might appeal to 95% of the people. The rest of us are not picky or perfectionists, we have a standards when it comes to dining out. If you are going to run a food establishment, show us your passion."}
{"text":"On a recent, cold winter's Wednesday, I had the opportunity to have dinner at Caplansky's Delicatessen on College Street. Having heard a number of things about Zane Caplansky's mission to re-invigorate, or at least continue the waning culture of the deli, I was intrigued.

The first thing I noticed, besides the tiny vestibule, is the number of framed magazine covers and articles adorning the walls. It is obvious that this place has captured the attention of many reviewers, both far and wide.

The decor is pure deli. Open all the way back to the meat counter, with requisite white-hatted carver, it is a mixture of banquettes and bare wooden chairs. The walls are covered with kitschy pressed signs advertising everything from chopped liver to catering. Clearly, a lot of work went into making this place feel authentic; like it had been here for 80 years.

Our server was quick to get our drink order and explain the daily soup and what the kitchen was out off. He was back, eager to help, a couple of times before our decisions were made.

Within moments, he was back with our soup order. The borscht was hearty and thick with shredded cabbage and chunks of meat. It was slightly sweet and full of flavour, with just a hint of tomato. Possibly one of the best borscht's I have had in Toronto. My guest's turkey soup, which happened to be the daily soup special, was interesting to say the least. Everything in the bowl, turkey and vegetables, was shredded very finely. It had a hint of smoke, which left us wondering if they were using yesterday's house smoked turkey breast. It was quite tasty, but completely unexpected.

With our soups almost done, our server returned with sides of smoked meat poutine. As a second course, it was the perfect size for two to share. The fries were crisp and cooked well. The gravy was more of a ragout of smoked meat and onions, seasoned thoroughly. The only complaint to be had was the small amount of curds.

With all our bowls cleared away, the mains soon arrived. I opted for a smoked meat sandwich. It arrived with a pickle spear and a small cup of oil and vinegar coleslaw. The meat was moist and well smoked. The fattiness was exactly as I ordered. The sandwich came unadorned with mustard, which was nice as four styles were provided for you to choose. The coleslaw was sweet with a little tang, neither overly vinegary nor oily.

On the other side of the table, grilled kebabs were ordered. The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender and a beautiful medium rare, with a nice crust, which pleasantly tasted of charcoal. Served with a grilled vegetable medley and side salad, it was quite a large portion. Care should be given, as the kitchen uses metal skewers, which, without warning from the server, turned out to be very hot to touch.

All in all, it was quite a good meal. Everything the kitchen put forth was prepared with pride. The only real issue was the desserts: a mixed berry crumble and a chocolate bread pudding. Both were incredibly sweet and had their issues with technique. Unfinished, however, the server asked what we thought and immediately offered to find something more appealing when we told him our thoughts. Kudos to the good service.

Caplansky's Delicatessen lived up to the promise. The food is very well prepared and delicious. Coupled with the easy-going, friendly service, I can see myself going back there time and again."}
{"text":"Myself and my party stumbled upon this place by pure chance as we were actually heading to another brunch place which apparently was closed...on a long weekend!!

My first impression was spacious! And I just loved the cute little bar, back rest counter high white stools and a full drink selection. Only around for a year and a half, it seemed to already have made a name for itself, with its handful of cut out newspaper reviews proudly framed on the wall as you walk in (and the first thing you would see, which was a nice touch to the place). We guessed from the blown up photo of some dude in a chef outfit crossed armed and full of attitude was the owner/chef himself. All this gave a nice personal touch to the place.

Once seated, we were served right away by an eager waitress. I ordered the 'Breakfast Special' ($9), although you're tempted to say 'I'll have the Breakfast Special 9' as the number '9' reads as part of the dish name instead of the price itself, perhaps something that can be improved on just for ease of clarity. After the fumble, we were reassured that many make the same mistake. Tea or coffee was included in the special, so I ordered earl gray tea, which was served in a small teapot compressor.

The menu was the actual table mat, blue and white in color with a fair selection of items. We noticed that their smoked meat sandwich's were a big hit, something to try for next time. We also noticed that the milk was annoyingly served in a small tin container, and there being 5 of us in total, it became a bit ridiculous asking the waitress to keep making multiple trips back to the kitchen to keep re-filling the tiny buggers!

Four of the five meals came out after a 30 minute wait; my boyfriends came out 15 minutes after that. This was a bit annoying to be honest, but compensated for after receiving an apology from the waitress along with a five dollar coupon for our next visit (we're easily pleased) always a nice touch and appreciated. Although for that even extra nice bit of touch (going the extra mile as they say) it would have been even nicer for the 'don't mess with' owner/chef guy to come out in person and apologize for the long wait. I never understand why some restaurants don't do this, it shows the restaurant cares just that little bit extra, changing the customers opinion of the place from 'I got a fiver for my next visit' to telling their friends about it. I saw Mr. attitude himself so he was there.

The meal was nice and the portion size just right. Eggs were a bit too runny, always a favorite! But their hash browns were yummy, complimented very well with the apple sauce addition. Their bacon was a bit too hard and their fruit salad was just that, fruit! Nothing really here to get me to come back, although I wanna try that meat sandwich!!

The total bill for the two of us was $27, not bad for what you get. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot, I mean we do have that fiver :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing

My wife and I had dinner this past weekend.  We were pretty disappointed. We both ordered the brisket dinner which is braised brisket in a bbq sauce.  The brisket was dry and tough.  My serving was even worse.  Half my serving was pure fat.  Where a double brisket meets is always a big hunk of fat that needs to be cut away and thrown out.  I ended up with a big chunk of it.  The server came around to ask how our meal was and then ran off before we could answer her.  We needed to literally call her over to speak to her.  The manager only charged for one of the two meals.  It was a nice gesture but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a unkempt dive in need of major renovations. If it looks dirty then the food is dirty. I had a corned beef sandwich, it was the smallest I've ever had, wife and daughter couldn't even finish what they ordered.
The service was great, but it was a dive and dirty."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and were looking forward to experience eating in a Jewish deli.
The place was not very clean or inviting..the food-nothing special.We will definitely not recommend our friends to waste their time and money."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert by any means, but the smoked meat tasted as good as anything I've had in Montreal. I only got take-out, but the place seemed really nice and had a cool vibe. I'm definitely going to go back; I really want to try the knish."}
{"text":"We went here because of Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  It did not disappoint.  Amazing wait staff.  Food was delicious and plentiful.   Don't order too many extras.  The sandwiches are huge.  Can't wait to finish my tuna sandwich tomorrow!!!  Will go back again!  Loved it."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch.  Super busy but super courteous staff!  Great selection of mustards :)  Great quality sandwich meat :)  And... Rick Mercer came in and got a table right beside me :)"}
{"text":"dig that sign of theirs a lot. And the food I had was really quite delish, not to mention the delightful pink lemonade and vodkas recommended to me by the very sweet and friendly server. I'm told brunch is very good, and i'm going to try it one of these days. Yay!"}
{"text":"Four stars considering it's located in an airport. Yes the prices are higher, the service a bit off and the atmosphere is a little bland, but everything was decent considering what this terminal and most airports offer for dining options.

Tried the meatloaf, it was alright, came with nice saut√©ed seasonal veg and fries that were nothing special. Also tried the matzo ball soup and borscht, go with the borscht not your typical Russian or Ukrainian style but pretty good. Also tried the Rubenesque Rueben sandwich and it was good. My recommendation would be to stick with soup and sandwich, it all seemed freshly prepared and of slightly better quality than your typical airport fare. 

Before boarding your next flight be sure to try a pint of their house tap which comes with a pickle on it. 

They also have a take out counter, you would be the envy of your flight if you unwrapped one of their sandwiches at 35,000 feet."}
{"text":"Their claim to fame, the Smoked Meat, is pretty good. But everything else I've tried has been just OK (or in some cases unavailable due to weird supply shortages). Soups are OK, knish was OK, beef brisket OK, fries were soggy and greasy, meatloaf was overpowered by thyme or rosemary (don't recall which)..

I really wanted to like this place, but unless I order a smoked meat sandwich I usually end up disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch. My suggestion is you get there about 1145am, before the regular lunch crowd. 

I've tried several different items from the menu and not been disappointed yet. 

My two friends and I shared an order of fries - it was enough for the three of us. We finally learned our lesson from the many previous visits.

The pickles are delicious, and there is an extremely wide selection of mustards to choose from.

Start with a regular smoked meat sandwich - then expand your horizons from there.

If you like deli, you'll love Caplansky's"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other night, I had the smoked meat sandwich and it was really good. The hot mustard (with horseradish in it) is awesome and I wish I had bought a bottle to take home. We also ordered the deep fried pickles which had a weird, thick batter on them and didn't taste very good. Other then that we'll definitely be back for the sandwiches and fries."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited the restaurant before our night class. The sandwich was very tasty and the service was decent.

The smoked meat sandwich definitely comparable to the ones in Montreal! 

Definitely recommending for anyone who wants a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I ate at caplansky's on college st. today and had a smoked meat sandwich- disappointing. The fries arrive cold and limp- not fresh cut."}
{"text":"I had a pretty stressful work week and was in need of some comfort food so came here for dinner.  Unlike everyone around me, I didn't have the smoked meat, I had the meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes.  It was awesome!

I found it to be a really friendly place and as has been previously mentioned, you are struck by a fantastic, home cooking kind of smell when you walk in.  It's nothing fancy to look at but its kind of cheery and definitely gave me the pick me up I needed.

I'll definitely come back for the smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Great ideas for deli and great truck.  Great to have in the Iittle Italy, a true neighbourhood winner =)"}
{"text":"Good meat, HORRIBLE service.

I don't know what happened to this place. It was clean, smart, well thought out but my last two visits were awful. It couldn't be more apparent that the restaurant doesn't care about service when the owner sits in the middle of a filthy, slammed restaurant and is more interested in his own food that taking care of his customers or helping a waitress who's been completely overrun by customers.

Drop the fork and hire some staff. Polite staff if you can manage it."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre.

I had the brisket which was decent but a little bland and the poutine which featured soggy fries and some smoked meat- again bland. Girlfriend had the smoked meat which was also mediocre. Didnt have much smoke taste and was more like a corned beef sandwich.

I didnt expect Schwartz's but this wasnt even close. I've had a better sandwich at Pancer's and even Pickle Barrel. 

Pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"Food is great, no doubt. You will leave there happy with your meal

Poor ratings go to the owner. Ever since I saw this guy on Dragons Den I just don't want to give him my money. Not sure why really but just came off poorly and don't really feel the desire to go out of my way to this place anymore. Used to go all the time but not since I saw him on TV.

Hope he makes the $$$$$ he desperately wants.

Also there are a lot of comparisons with Schwartz's in MTL. Please stop this. Schwartz does provide it's meat to stores but they aren't as desperate as Caplanskys to expand and advertise... that's part of it's unique charm and character. Caplansky will sell out as soon as he can."}
{"text":"This location can feed a celiac who is exhausted and facing 7 hours or more in the sky. Not as huge a menu as on College, but not too shabby!"}
{"text":"If this place can feed a delicate celiac at lunch time and make the sandwich delicious, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"This place gets a star because the food was decent. 

We sat down just before 11am and it took 20 mins for our drinks to arrive and another 15 for food. We were sharing a Montreal smoked meat sandwich and fries, so we were done pretty fast. No coffee or water refills were offered, and we asked for our bill 10 mins ago and we are still waiting. 

Avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"So I stopped here last Sunday for a second go around at the new location. The last time I had gone was with a friend about 3 days after they first opened, so there was a rush of well... people. And the service at the time was a nightmare due to teething problems. 

Service was great on this occasion but this was might have something to do with the fact that there was only 4-5 occupied tables when I walked in. 

I had the typical sandwich + soup combo as well as a pint of Duggan's no. 9 IPA. I had to note that the guy who poured it kept on pouring too much head though. I was kind of amused to see him  pour it out and try again about 3 times before he handed it to me.

Ordered it fatty and the soup of the day was split pea + smoked meat. I actually liked the soup but it needed more meat to it. It just kind of felt like smoked meat was thrown into a soup rather than forming like voltron into a cohesive tasty unit (not going to complain too much about adding more meat into anything though). I remember kind of feeling the same way about the borscht last time as well.

The fatty was moist & delicious now that I finally got to try it (had a medium last time due to an order mix-up) and I really like the fact that they had all those mustards on hand (they only had the stereotypical yellow squeeze bottles at the beginning). I know they probably fixed those problems months ago but I haven't been able to come back to Toronto in awhile so there.

I can safely say that I want to come back again soon. If not for the smoked meat sandwich than just to try out the other things on the menu (pickled tongue sandwich! liver and onions!)."}
{"text":"Looking at older reviews it seems like this place has really stepped up their game. I had the Bagel + Lox. Loaded with lox and capers. Bagel was fresh and delicious. Coleslaw on the side was excellent. My companion had the all day breakfast, which was also fantastic. Service was quick and friendly. For regular food this was great, for airport food it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in town. The fries were really good..."}
{"text":"Come on, people, there are just countless other places to get a decent sandwich, heck you and I can schlep/slap sth together better without breaking a bead of sweat.

I wanted to do a 1 review but couldn't think of a place, then browsing around saw the Cap, and since I was just there couple of nights ago, thinking I was trying it for the first time, as I was sipping the recom cherry cola with smoke meat/fries combo, I had a deja-deteste and realized years and years ago, I'd already done this.

We've all been to Mtl, we've tried the real deal, and even that is meh, all right.  The Cap version, holy mack, baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, maybe ok if ye were starving, fries were the only good thing, slaw, nope, pickle, nope, cherry cola, soo bad (I know they didn't brew it, but freak, they picked it and stocked it).  Honestly, it was the cherry cola that triggered the memory.

PLACE

Dirty, mangey, right, just that feeling of ick.

SERVICE (4 - 5 stars)

Genuine.  Really nice folk, from the family to the hired, they treat their ppl, right.  Think this place has good karma going for it.  It gets quite busy at times, though Sat night, round 9, it was dead.  Lunch crowd rush?

I might order from their food truck if I was marooned somewhere, but in Kensington or little Italy, omg, sooooooooo many other options."}
{"text":"Walking out of Caplansky's Deli, I had mixed reactions. The Turkey BLT, Caesar Salad, and Smoked Meat sandwich were great. So what's with the Poutine and Maple Beef Bacon Doughnuts? While I fully recognize that not everything on a menu can be made to the same standard, sometimes it is odd what stands out as being \"meh\" at best.

Sadly, the doughnuts were nothing more than meh for me. They sounded delicious, but upon inspection, some body has no idea how to properly make a doughnut and how to highlight the ingredients for which an item is named. The bacon was barely noticeable, and was little more than hard pieces of bacon reminiscent of what is sold at the grocery as \"Bacon Bits\". The interior dough was greasy, and the exterior was overly dark and slightly burned. The maple syrup was thin and watery, and over powered by powdered sugar.

The Poutine was just odd. The cheese looked like the little shreds of feta you find in the bottom of the crumbled feta container, and the gravy was like the maple syrup - thin. The fries were okay. 

The highlights of the Deli were definitely the sandwiches. The meat was juicy and flavorful. There was no question as to the freshness of what was being served. There was not an overabundance of spreads or sauces - the tender morsels of meat were the star of the show. 

If you're going to make a stop here, grab a sandwich. The portion sizes are generous and they pack a lot of meat between the bread. There is no skimping going on here."}
{"text":"There's just something really cozy and homey about this place. Nothing cheers me up quicker than some latkes and sour cream. It's near my apartment, so I usually come here for brunch after a late night... a little bit hungover... The breakfast platter and cream cheese and lox bagel breathes new life into me. The servers are so so friendly, and occasionally Zane Caplansky is there helping with the service and asking everyone if their food is alright. It can get crowded at times (usually during lunch hours), but I've never had to wait more then 15 minutes to be seated. I'll be sad when I move and am not down the street from this place, there's just something special about it.

(Tip: Don't get the latke poutine though... I found it pretty gross)"}
{"text":"I heard this place was great ... not so .. I had a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a mushroom soup. The sandwich was pretty good but a bit soggy. The soup was hot water with big mushrooms in it, also not good. Than they gave me a bag of fries that were old and stale. So all and all pretty bad food and all this was over 20 bucks so ya kinda of a ripoff. Very over rated just like most places and I will never return. Also it's not a deli you can't buy any meat there it's a restaurant. Not sure why they call it a deli. However the hipster dude behind the counter with the buddy holly glasses and captain hook moustache provided good service... ha ha."}
{"text":"Overpriced, underwhelming meat sandwich.
It was  my first time here, so I decided to keep it simple and try a meat sandwich. $9 for a smoked turkey sandwich that was nothing but bread and chunks and chunks of turkey - no mustard, no lettuce/tomato/pickle, just bread and meat.

And I've had way better smoked turkey than this, nothing to write home about.
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to visit caplanskys after watching it on triple D. Overall expeirence was poor. Service was slow, my friend never got it his meal and the food although delicious was over priced."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to mention Schwartz in Mtl when think about smoked meat. But when you can't travel to Montreal and the craving for smoked meat is overwhelming, toronto has it's own answer, Caplansky's.  The smoked meat is flavourful and every close to Schwartz. It's a little less juicy and I believe the way they cut the meat is a bit different, also the sandwiches aren't ridiculously over piled with meat. But washed down with a cherry soda, who can really complain about the minor differences. The Ruben is also delicious, if you go on the day of the week they offer it. However if the Ruben is what your after and your extra nice to the wait staff they may be able to make you one on any given day."}
{"text":"We've always wanted to try Caplansky's since moving to Toronto.  Today we went to the College Street location and REALLY wanted to like the food.  My son and I had the smoked meat sandwich with fries and hubby had the burger.  The sandwiches were SO small and dry...the fries were burned.  For close to $70 (for 3 tiny sandwiches and 3 beers) we expected better.  Where on earth do they buy such SMALL rye bread slices?  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Had a \"fresser\" sized roast beef sandwich with no mustard. Added the \"SUPER HOT\" mustard that they provide at the table. The sandwich melted through the bread which I understood since they give you the option of \"lean, medium and fatty\" (i ordered the fatty). Full of taste, filling and juicy if not a little soggy due to the fat pouring out of it. 

Service was ok. having been in the restaurant business in my college days I understand the stress of having a full section. Our server remained friendly even if she was a bit distracted. The tastiness made up for it. I'll probably take my clients from MTL here in the future ."}
{"text":"Went for a Friday lunch, and had a great meal. Smoked meat and the selection of mustards really hit the spot, but the surprise was how good the soup was. 

Only odd thing was that our server was spectacularly clumsy, and spilled coffee on my buddy."}
{"text":"Coming from the industry I jump at any place that serves breakfast all day, but going to Caplansky's is like tossing a coin- a 50% chance you will have an enjoyable experience (Grand Electric coming in a close second).

The Classic is a brilliant item- 3 eggs/ beef bacon/ toast/ latkes/ and coffee or tea. But sometimes they do it right, and sometimes they do it reallllyyy wrong.  

A couple of times I've had eggs pooling in grease and almost cake like (in the sense that someone couldn't find a bigger pan and crammed 3 eggs into a small one- which comes out with egg whites as thick as the toast) The same goes for the Latkes- greasy and underdone- or yummy. I just wish that they were shredded potatoes and pan grilled as oppose to something that can go very wrong and sometimes tastes like underdone onion bread.

Other times my meal is perfectly cooked but I can't get the server to pay attention to simple duties for the LIFE of me. 

Its not very hard to put cutlery on my table before the meal comes, or get my water AND hot sauce and not only bring one and forget the other- then make me ask again and take 10 minutes. Or that you can't do the 2 Bites 2 Minutes rule and come ask me if I need anything (like water)...ESPECIALLY if my gf and I are 2/8 people there. Let's be honest, as a server with a semi-empty restaurant. I would be fired if I did that at my bar or restaurant.

 I don't know which guy this is but he is always the worst. Sometimes I see him and don't even bother- because he WILL make you feel like you are imposing. I wish I could remember his name for the life of me for you Yelpers- so you know when, and when NOT to go to Caplansky's. 

All that being said. They have me hooked- to simple well priced and tasty food with occasional nice servers. And its in my area. If you've never been- give it a shot because its worth it. But its up to you to decide if it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We had the brisket sandwich and the smoked meat sandwich. Compared to our gold standard (Schwartz for smoked meat and Black camel for brisket), sadly, this place was not able to knock those off our number one spots. Both sandwiches are slightly on the dry side - need more fatty cuts of meat. Still a yummy meal overall...

Portion size is generous. Service was great."}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place for a long time and finally went here for lunch with a friend of mine a few days ago. We were both really glad we did!

I am not familiar with Kosher food, but what we ordered was delicious. I wish I had more time in Toronto to return and try everything else on the menu. I had their soup special (sweet potatoes) and a half-brisket/half-tongue sandwich on recommendation from our server. For dessert I tried their maple bacon doughnut. It was interesting, worth at least a try though I can see how people would have different opinions about it.

What really sealed the deal for us though was the great service. Eric made us feel very welcomed and took time between serving tables to engage in friendly conversation. It was clear to see he was very knowledgeable and cared a lot about the food and his patrons. That is why I am giving this place a 5/5!"}
{"text":"Fresser fatty cut, glass of coke, bread pudding

Thank you"}
{"text":"I'm gonna say up front that I'm definitely no expert on smoked meat. My boyfriend had been suggesting Caplansky's for a while now and I was always hesitant to come because I always thought I didn't like smoked meat. My experience here definitely changed my mind.

I went with the basics and ordered the Sandwich Combo - smoked meat sandwich and cup of chicken soup with Matzoh balls ($12). I wasn't a huge fan of the matzoh ball soup as I found it a little bland. My boyfriend also said it wasn't one of the better ones he's had (he said his mom makes it better, of course!).

However, the sandwich was amazing! When ordering your sandwich, the server will ask if you want the lean, medium or fatty meat. Since it was my first time I went with the medium. The sandwich arrived, piled high with meat in between two slices of rye bread. Each table has a selection of mustards, and for a person who loooves condiments, I didn't even put any mustard on my sandwich because it was so flavourful.

The sandwiches come with a pickle, which was really delicious. Why do I mention this? Cause I'm a huge fan of pickles..I'm one of those people who will buy a jar of pickles just to snack on, so I know a good pickle when I taste one :)"}
{"text":"Cashier Alakabeen is one of the rudest cashiers I have ever met. I went to the take out desk to order food and planned to eat at the take out tables. She gives me this long rant about how I need to sit in the dine in area and points me to sit at the tables. I sit for 10 minutes and shes like 'oh you want food?' I was like 'yes you told me to sit here' then shes like 'NO! I told you that it comes in take out container, so I thought you didn't want food.'

??!!!! I said I didnt care that it was in a take out container, I just want food.

She didnt get it.

????

I wanted to order take out food and then she gives me shit for wanting to order take out and sitting in the take out area after she tells me to sit? Then I tried to clear things up with her but she becomes extremely rude and starts saying she did nothing wrong.

Overall this lady made it into a terrible experience. I love caplansky's but was not expecting this.

The other servers were polite but I'm sorry Alakabeen needs to be trained in customer service and learn communication skills before she works in a service industry. Yelling at a customer and raising your voice for what at best was a miscommunication is not someone I would ever want in the service industry."}
{"text":"The knish was to die for! Totally meaty and full of flavour. Portions were reasonable too.

Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I had BBQ brisket tacos and they were amazing! Meat is so delicious! And the staff is friendly. What else you need?"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a sandwich, but this is the best smoked meat in Toronto.

Forget about those other places serving smoked meat that they bought somewhere else to prepare in-restaurant. Caplansky's does theirs from scratch, and the result is a mix of BBQ and deli.

Katz's has nothing on this place. Don't waste your time at any other place, go to Caplansky's.

Update August 2017:

Went back today and had a smoked meat and some fries. Simply put, they have the best french fries in the city. I've had fries all over the place, and these are the best. It's worth going here just for the darn fries. They're that good.

Sandwich was very tender and very tasty. Good mix of smoke and flavour. My favourite deli in the world at this point.

Service was excellent today as well."}
{"text":"Had fantastic brunch here. I ordered The Special (that's what it's called) as that is the closest thing that have to the classic bacon, eggs and toast kind of brunch, but wow, it had some good Caplansky twists.
It comes with three eggs any style, good serving of house smoked beef bacon (definitely haven't seen this anywhere else; because it's beef, the bacon tasted more like jerky, in a good way), toasted and buttered rye bread, apple sauce that is not too sweet, and these two flattened potato patty things that were pan fried (later learned that they are potato latkes)...it was salty and savoury, with a good amount of cracked black pepper to give it a kick. I loved that it wasn't a bland, boring brunch. Oh, and it comes with unlimited tea or coffee, for 11 dollars!!!!! Oh Caplansky's, never change.
 
The service was amazing. Everyone is very polite, welcoming, smiley, and most importantly, nothing important was ever missed; the sugar, the wooden basket of house-made/popular condiments, refills, all were there when I needed them.

Their decor and their plates and things look a little run-down and tired, but the food and service easily overshadows those aspects and can make them charming, and make the place feel more neighbourhood favourite-y lol. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Some of the food is really good. The staff are generally great. 
But it's overpriced and overhyped.
Zane Caplansky is also a very gross person, and I feel sorry for his staff. I have seen him acting a fool in front of customers and witnessed him yell at a server. 
I won't go here anymore just because I don't like the owner.
Also, Free Times down the road has better latkes."}
{"text":"My bestie recommended this place to me, but it turns out it's really expensive and the only thing I enjoyed eating was the pickles. Pass."}
{"text":"When this restaurant was on Clinton st, small and getting started it was a great smoked sandwich. Like anything that expands, it's not the same good food. It still is a little pricy for a smoked sandwich and fries. Bring back Switzers on Spadina!!!!!!!

Wanting Quality in this city again, what happen! Good old mass production, erupted. Processed, processed.
People will pay! will pay! for good simple food. 
Eating a lot at home!"}
{"text":"Great food and bacon, we wanted to go to aunties brunch down the street but long wait. Has outdoor seating and makes its own bread and bagels. Slightly over priced"}
{"text":"My first and last experience with Caplansky's was only through their food truck. Which I recommended for a friends wedding that I was helping with the planning.

It seemed like a great option, they went for the tasting, loved the food and booked the truck. Email confirmation and contracts in place.

Four months before the wedding my friend called to confirm numbers and food specifications and they didn't return her calls. A few days later, they called to let her know that they wouldn't be at her wedding because they were going to go to the CNE instead.

The CNE is the exact same time every single year. And they knew that when they took her booking, but told her they didn't want to turn down the CNE because it was more money.

Four months before her wedding. On one of the busiest wedding days of the year. 

They offered little apologies and no recommendations for an alternative except offering to 'drop off' poutine around 7pm. Obviously cold soggy poutine was not what she was hoping to serve.

Thanks for nothing Caplanksy's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I sought out Caplansky's after he saw the place featured on TV and heard rave reviews. Both of us thought the meal was mediocre at best, and sloppily put together. Thinking that we'd give the place another chance for breakfast last Sunday. This was a huge mistake. 

I requested hot water with lemon, but was told that they did not have lemon. I thought it was strange for a restaurant not to have lemons but ordered tea instead. 

When our food arrived, my boyfriend's bagel came with a lemon wedge on the side. I'm not sure why our server wouldn't give me one with my drink. His bagel was extremely stale and difficult to chew it was so hard.

My meal (the classic scramble) arrived with no bacon and my eggs fried instead of scrambled, which is what i requested. By the time I was able to get the server's attention to let her know that my meal didn't arrive with the meat that it's supposed to come with, I had finished everything else (the fried eggs and latkes - which were burnt but edible). No apology, she just came back a few minutes later and plopped a plate of bacon in front of me. 

As we were munching on the bacon, I noticed a long hair in the midst of it!!!!! It was clearly neither of ours, and we again tried to get our server's attention. That took another several minutes as she kept disappearing. When I pointed out the hair, the response I got was, \"You want salami instead?\" Again, no apology. We declined the salami and asked for our bill. 

When she came with our bill, she mentioned that she removed the $3 orange juice from our bill because of the hair, and said so in a way that came across like she was doing us some huge favour. And then, we had to wait another 15 minutes before she came back to take our payment.

I'm not one to complain at restaurants, but I was quite worked up by the time we got out of there. The service was appalling, the food was pretty bad, and definitely not worth the $35 we still had to pay for breakfast. Avoid Caplansky's Deli."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.

I've been craving a smoked meat sandwich and experiencing painfully yummy flashbacks of my experiences at Schwartz's when I saw Zane Caplansky's appearance on the Dragons' Den. The dragons got to try some delicious-looking sandwiches and were raving about how good they were, so I decided to give Caplnasky a try (after promptly wiping the drool off my face).

I came here for lunch, ordered the Reubenesque sandwich (smoked meat, swiss cheese, Russian dressing, sauerkraut) for $13, and was sorely disappointed. The portion size was small and didn't come with any sides (I didn't even get a full pickle!). The sandwich itself was okay, but it was a bit too oily and could've used more flavour (the rye bread was grilled to perfection, though!). Not good value for money. After shelling out $15+ for a sandwich, at the very least I'd expect to feel full. Nope, didn't happen.
 
Meh. I don't get the hype. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Atmosphere was great, servers were nice and friendly. I ordered the matzo ball soup and the smoked meat sandwich. The soup was a bit bland, I thought, but the sandwich was amaaaaaazing!!! I also loved the homemade mustard and walked out of there with 2 bottles lol. All for 23$ too I must say! Great place, definitely want to stop in again before I leave Toronto."}
{"text":"The staff was quite cheerful!

Point for improvement: The menu seems limited, though the food itself is quite good.

Does not serve lattes, but has self service coffee and cream if that's your thing.

Extra points for the soundtrack! Very light classic rock (Led Zeppelin, Yes, etc) at a perfectly adequate volume."}
{"text":"I'd never go back. Doesn't go anywhere near the hype. Food took forever to arrive, never got the soup we ordered. Meat was sliced so thick it was almost inedible. They should invest in a meat slicer. Save your money."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. Also very much enjoyed the \"What Zane Eats\": chopped liver, red onion and grilled beef salami sandwich with sweet Russian mustard.  The blintz was alright, but the maple bacon donuts were too heavy for me (maybe the oil was a little too cool that day). i think portions were good...don't kid yourself, there's a lot of fat and salt in that sandwich! We left very full..."}
{"text":"$19.95 pitcher and smoked meat poutine was a total win.  service was quick, but not too terribly attentive.  the patio was small and busy, but there was no wait to sit down."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch midweek and were seated right away.  Menu seemed pretty basic but still needed some explanation of certain items.  Wait staff was efficient and friendly, and refilled water often.  Food was really tasty, meat was lean and flavorful.  Fries were also great and did not need ketchup.  

Overall, the food was great and the service was good, however I think the price was a little high for what I received.  I would go back but just wished the pricing was more reasonable."}
{"text":"Loved my recent lunch, but have to say that brunch was even better. The hash was just what my dehydrated stomach wanted.  Not to mention the attentive staff who understood that I couldn't quite face the bottom of my water glass.  
Not where to go for a salad, but a for sure stop for indulging."}
{"text":"*Minus 1/2-star because I was cheated on the fries and the sandwich didn't live up to the hype.*

The Good:  awesome tomatoes in the pickle platter; homemade grainy mustard; the font on the menu (I'm a details person); black cherry soda; our sweet-as-pie waitress 

The Bad: the fries (somehow managed to be soggy AND burnt at the same time); the slaw

The Mediocre: the smoked meat; the rye

Maybe it was the excess of spilt review ink, or the former mayor of Toronto gushing shamelessly about Caplansky's on TVO, or because I grew up in the Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn and was practically weaned on corned beef on rye...but I don't get what all the fuss is about. 

My 7-oz. smoked meat sandwich with \"medium\" fattiness was fine, if a little on the dry/shreddy side. I so wanted the meat to be transcendent, something approaching the magic of Katz's Deli in NYC. Heck, when I consume something that's gonna clog up my arteries that much, it better be pretty friggin' spectacular. Sadly, Caplansky's smoked meat was just all right, and the insipid rye that came with it was not helping matters.

The S.O. and I agreed that the fries were an abomination. After a few bites, I looked carefully at the basket of mangled ropes of tater and wondered, \"Are these regular fries or sweet potato fries?\" Shame on the fry cook; that's no way to treat a potato.

What really made our meal was our waitress. She was exuberant without being annoying, and attentive without being effusive. If they made a movie about Caplansky's the role of our waitress would be played by Amy Adams. 

I dunno. Maybe my Montreal-transplant friend was right: You can't get good smoked meat in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot for casual eating in the city. It has never disappointed. Outstanding food, combined with quick, efficient and unflappable service, are unmatched by any other spot. Even the bottomless coffee is excellent. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"love the to go counter 
dont have to wait 
can load up the sandwich as much as i like
the quality of the meat is getting better now +AAA"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this.  I was raised by the son of a Jewish butcher from Newark, NJ.  His childhood (and my own) included frequent visits to NYC and NJ delis.  Those are some high standards to live up to.  Based on that information, here's what I'd say about Caplansky's.

1 - the brisket is so good, even my Dad likes it.  (a man so picky about his brisket that he's made his own at home since his mom passed in the mid 90s)

2 - KISHKA!!  OMG!!!  i love Kishka, to the max.  they have it, and it's amazing.  I haven't had kishka so delicious since my Nana died. 

3 - their smoked meat is delish.  go full fat - for reals.  

4 - the service here is friendly, my coffee and water are always full, and that's not something i take for granted. 

5 - it's nice inside.  i like the ceiling."}
{"text":"I tried three kinds of sandwiches, the fries, and the pickle bar. It was all delicious. The place was clean, service was good."}
{"text":"Yum! Smoked meat, sour pickles, poutine, Mac and cheese...yum!

We had just arrived in Toronto, wanted smoked meat and poutine, and what a find. They also served amazing black cherry soda, I think it is called Cott's.

The atmosphere is perfect deli..steamed windows, the hum of the bread slicer, deli mustard for sale and a reminder of my grandparents all around."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat in a newer trendier location.  We went to the mothership on College last time.  We ordered smoked meat sandwiches (combination fat and lean) and a Reuben with fries.  They have a great pickled vegetable and a mustard bar up the stairs.  Try everything.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Was ok.  Portions were small for what you pay.  I had the matzo ball soup which lacked flavour.  The latkes were okay...nothing special.  My husband had the signature sandwich and said it was good.  Server was indifferent."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night and found the experience underwhelming and overpriced.

The fries came about 10 minutes before our sandwiches and were stale and under-seasoned. Our smoked meat sandwiches were good, but nothing amazing and on the small side. The service was generally disorganized, but friendly enough, and they mixed up our table's tab which came to $54 with tax and tip.  For the money, you're better off going to the Lakeview (still not a great eatery, but it's at least better and the beer is much cheaper). Hell, for about $55 you can get a great meal at Zocalo.

All in all, it's not a bad restaurant, it's just not particularly good. I think I will get my smoked meat fix when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a bite. Gives Shwartz in Montreal a run for their money. Will definitely drop by again when im in the area."}
{"text":"The smoke meat sandwiches is great. Don't  try the French toast tower. It is disappointing. Three thin slices of French toast stacked up and three slices of beef bacon within super light blue berry sauce. This dish has no flavour and it does not worth $16 for this dish."}
{"text":"Great service. Even Caplansky himself served us the food. But one thing really stood out: I was hungry after. 

My large poutine felt more like a medium. It was skimpy on the skinny fries and curds. The meat was a strange mush, which was just OK. I appreciated all the sauces. But I left feeling hungry, despite $15 later. 

This place isn't a deli. It's a restaurant. I would like a cafeteria/take-away option. Also increase in portion sizes. This is nowhere near the caliber of other delis. I just felt there should be more value, bigger portions and bigger taste."}
{"text":"Good place but I would say a bit overrated. We had the smoked meat sandwich and the corned beef. The smoked meat was ok but definitely not one of the best. Many other places would come to mind for smoked meat before I'd think of this one. We tried the poutine also, it was fantastic. Homemade fresh fries, with smoked meat. One of the best poutine I've ever had. I come from Montreal where poutine and smoked meat are very popular meals. It's fair to say I know what to expect when having those dishes. Overall, I would go again for a poutine."}
{"text":"Sandwiches just passable.
Breakfast way overpriced/
Come on--almost 20$ with tax and tip
Give me a break."}
{"text":"So I came back to have more of Caplansky's delicacies. The last time I was here, I could barely finish the poutine so I decided to bring a friend in tow this time around. We ordered 

a) Fatty Smoked Meat Sandwich - really enjoyed this. The smokiness was just right and there was no dryness or chewiness at all. The bread was soft and perfect with the mustard. 

b) Beef Brisket on an Onion Bun - yum! The spices are good and the beef is tender and juicy. I could do without the huge stalks of herbs being caught inb/t my teeth tho. The bun was your typical onion bun.

c) Latkes - pretty good. I am not a huge fan of Latkes but I thought this was passable.

d) Side Poutine - read my previous review for my take on this. I still like it a lot. However, I found the fries a tad bit less crispy this time and the cheese could be melted a little bit more. 

As for service, it was good as usual. The waitress kept checking up on us without being over-bearing."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant, and they have perhaps the best smoked-meat sandwiches around! When I came in I was immediately greeted and brought to a table, they also have a lovely patio if you wish to sit outside. When they bring your water, they bring you a chilled jug of water with a glass, which is a unique twist. 

For lunch, I ordered the Smoked meat sandwich with the smoked meat poutine and the maple bacon donuts for dessert. The sandwich was absolutely tantalizing, with oodles of delicious smoked meat goodness. At the table you get your choice of delicious mustard, and I went with the mild one but there are 2 other stronger flavours. It came with coleslaw and a pickle as well, the coleslaw was excellent but the pickle wasn't the greatest. For the poutine, I was slightly worried about it being a sloppy mess, but it was actually a delicious combination of smoked meat, cheese, and fries. The meat is served as almost a chili-like mixture, over the yummy cheese and the mouthwatering fries. The fries were the best part, they were nice, light, and crispy. The maple bacon donuts were TO DIE FOR. They were absolutely amazing. You get three timbit-esque donut rolls, topped with maple bacon, maple syrup, and icing sugar. The donuts are warm and fresh right out of the oven, and the maple bacon was delicious and full of flavour. Perhaps it could do with a bit more bacon? Perhaps I'm being greedy,

The one area of annoyance for me was the service. For starters, I ordered a coke and it took longer than it should have to arrive. Secondly, my poutine was brought out before my sandwich, which was odd because I assumed it would come as a side with my sandwich. Aside from that it also got confusing as to whom my waiter was because I kept getting served by different people but the restaurant didn't seem busy enough to need other servers bringing me my food. However none of these were detrimental enough to be a major cause for concern.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable Jewish deli experience right in the heart of Toronto without having to go to Manhattan!"}
{"text":"I've been here in the past before the place became popular, probably at least 6 years ago, and it used to be much better. I feel it's definitely went downhill. 

This place originally created my love for matzahball soup but the soup I had this time was TERRIBLE. It was bland, tasted like celery and had no salt at all. I was extremely disappointed because that was the whole reason I went back.

My sandwich was decent but not even close to as good like how it used to be. The meat is cut far too thickly, there was less of it compared to other places and this place previously, it's not juicy despite me getting ''medium\" and there was stale cheese in my sandwich, it was literally too hard to bite...I had to take it out.

I also had fries. They were pretty good I guess, but everything else already ruined the experience.

In my opinion, if you want to compare this to other similar places, it deserves one star. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because despite the service not being the best, it's of no fault of the servers and they work so hard. The place is packed and the owner hasn't hired an adequate number of workers to handle it. 

Hopefully he will realize he's going downhill and improve and not end up the type of person you see on Restaurant Hell in 10 years who's in denial continuously talking about how good it used to be and must still be.

It used to be really good, too bad this is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Still not too close to Montreal smoke beef in Montreal. However the smoked beef sandwich is tasty. Def try the onion rings on the side. I find the place a bit overpriced. Also had the burger but wasn't anything higher than average."}
{"text":"After spotting a tweet from @amirad from @Mycitylives about @Caplanskys giving FREE fries with a @Foursquare check-in I looked up the address and turns out it was very close. The staff was very proud of their Best Smoked Meat in Town and really knew their stuff. I was given the full tour and enjoyed a smoked meat sandwich (\"FATTY\") - best flavor...and FREE fires - which were above average too :) They told me it takes 14 Days to Cure the meat and 11 hrs to slow smoke it...Caplansky's knows what they are doing. OH, and they have Story Telling Sundays...come by and visit."}
{"text":"Caplanksy's serves up a decent smoked meat sandwich, but I don't understand what all the fuss is about.

Maybe because of the profile this place has and the publicity it generates, people buy into it and mistakenly think it's better than anything else that's out there.

Or maybe it's just the absence of known competition (after the taco and donut trend in this city could we see a smoked meat trend?).

I have friends who rave about this place. Despite that, I didn't walk in with high expectations on my first visit. Good thing, because it was all \"just OK\" if you ask me. Same with two additional visits (most recently last week).

For the standard sandwich you get a good amount of meat served on soft bread, but it's nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Relaxing cozy environment. 
Ordered kinish. It is not bad. But not the kind of thing I like."}
{"text":"This is an amazing delicatessen, and a delightful sit-down experience. I would highly recommend popping in here for lunch if you are nearby, or even within a reasonable travel time.

I had the burger, which had a mix of ground beef and smoked meat, along with cheddar and beef bacon, on a delightful sesame bun. It was perfectly cooked, and topped with wonderfully fresh tomato and lettuce, which I do not normally enjoy on my burgers.

The Turkey Clubski is perhaps the best club I've had. It is made with real turkey breast, not luncheon meat, and beef bacon.  We also had the Mac and Cheese, excellent."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS.

The service was horrible, the soup was ice cold - along with everything else - except the coffee.. some of the staff (not all) were rude.. Had to seat ourselves (dinner guest included a very Pregnant Woman and a very elderly woman).. Glasses brought to us were dirty (think old lipstick marks).. 

We were terribly disappointed. I would never try this place again or recommend it to anyone. Waste of an outing. Epic fail. 

A GREAT diner for nice HOT deli sandwiches is Moe Pancers in North York on Bathurst."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich! The pickles! The perfectly crispy fries! And the selection of mustards!

Okay, so Caplansky's has a lot of things that I already love, but they do them so well. The smoked meat sandwich lived up to the hype and the pickles were the perfect combination of sour and salty. The array of mustard was delightful to sample. 

And I just love the feel of the place. The bright blue walls, surrounded by windows with light flooding in, the handwritten signs--all of it combines to create an effortless sense of comfort and ease. See you soon, Caplansky's."}
{"text":"Had a Caplansky burger and poutine with smoked meat. Burger was good, poutine decent, smoked meat rocked! Just wish they went easier on the onions."}
{"text":"When one hears the name Caplansky's, they are reminded and refreshed by thoughts in their minds that reflect nothing but great reviews on this sweet deli/soup/sandwich join that is always well rated and hyped in papers, and has been for many years.

I have been there three times. The first experience was identical to the last, and I don't remember the one visit in between.  About the many hyped reviews about this joint being the smoked meat winner joint in Toronto, I find it to be mostly hype.

It's a little overrated, and that's fine if it's good for the business. But the food, and servings, and the options as well all seemed really plain.

I found that their sandwiches, while quite full and stuffed with ingredients, seemed microwaved and made with wonderbread feeling type of bread. You could buy your own ingredients and made a sandwich that was better. It lacked \"umph\" and it lacked the satisfaction that you would get from biting into a well made sandwich post sex. Even if you aren't being fed a sandwich made by a babe post sex, a sandwich just has to have that feeling when you bite into it. This was more like the feeling of quickly slapping together some cold cut with mayo on bread after school or work, then sitting down infront of the tv to watch dry sitcoms or soul-draining day time tv.

It tasted decent, but not a memorable aftertaste, it doesn't leave an impression on your palette. The chances of you wanting to go back might vary from the next person because it all depends on how many other soup & sandwich and deli joints you have tried or read about.

There are plenty of other amazing soup & sandwich places, and this is probably not the best. I also found that their poutine was kind of plain. Not layered with cheese or gravy, which is disappointing because it was all just dumped on top of some fries that were painfully thin, as if they were young anorexic potatoes once before they were turned into fries. The portions were generous. The price is cheap. 

The only amazing thing about this place is that they are not lying about their very famous hot mustard, which is rumoured to be really strong. Do not leave the jar of their homemade mustard open and near your face for too long. It will burn your nostrils, hurt your head, but it tastes insanely amazing on whatever you order. Insanely amazing, never had a better mustard in my life. 

Before giving into the rumours or the band-wagon of cult followers of Caplanksy's and starting to declare that it's the bee's knee's when it comes to best smoked meats in town, I would definitely suggest that people try and explore other deli places! 

This place is decent."}
{"text":"Hehe what can I say, it's definitely representative of the ghetto-Jewish delis from the 80s/90s era. The value for your money is okay. The brick wall decor gives you the ghetto feel. The sandwiches taste great.

Fun fact: I took a date here once and as a reward for my patronage they gave her a glass with an imprint of a previous patron's lipstick...ah cutting corners, you stay classy you..."}
{"text":"Well this will be short I guess.

I've had the same waiter every time I come here, he's a skinny blonde guy who seems very happy to have you and always makes nice conversation. Service is good. Today he mixed up our drinks (all of them were brown fizzy drinks) but as soon as we noticed he was ready to fix the problem so that doesn't lose him any points.

I've only ever had the gefilte fish, but as someone who had their first plate of gefilte fish here I can tell you it is very sweet and juicy. They always give you enough horseradish too which is nice.

Today the owner himself came out, just at random, to ask me how my meal was! That was also very nice. We were in and out of the restaurant within 25 minutes. Also worth adding is that my first time here they didn't charge me for two \"jew it up!\" buttons.

They have a large array of t-shirts at the cash as well.

The only reason why I haven't given it five stars is that I haven't really eaten anything except the gefilte fish and a bite of my mom's meat sandwich here, but I'm sure it's all excellent, so don't mind that."}
{"text":"Overpriced!!! I had a tiny bagel with smoked salmon and it was $12. They only have plain bagels as well. Not filling at all for that price. My girlfriend had the French toast which was a good size but the flavours didn't really work well together and it was served with a tiny slice of bacon on top. Would not recommend -there are plenty of decent cafes with better food and prices! Go to NYC for good bagels!!!"}
{"text":"My first trip was long overdue and I'd heard a lot of hype about this place which perhaps set the bar a bit too high.  I'd been spending a lot of time in Montreal for the past few years and got used to the real thing from Schwartz's.

The sandwich is suitably sized but bread fairly small which makes the sandwich appear larger.  The meat - ordered medium was the right amount of fat and a nice subtle smoky flavour but was not really melt in your mouth.  Several chews were needed which I couldn't decide was the result of the meat or the thick cut.

The variety of mustard was great and the cabbage borscht was fantastic.  Also - they have beef bacon - what a simple concept - use some of the fattiest cuts of smoked meat, add a lot of salt and fry it.  Beautiful - a great change to overpriced double smoked applewood bacon nonsense.

I'd go back and give the sandwich another shot but I still believe Pancers wins the war of Toronto so far......"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for a quick meal before our flight.  We were told if we sat down it would be a maximum of 12 minutes. It took 30 minutes to get our food and we ended up having to take our meal to-go. Overall the food was ok but the service was not as we expected."}
{"text":"Had a very nice Smoked meat on light rye, whole mustuard, with hand cut fries, and a very good cup of black coffee...wow !
Nice people, nice place. fast service.
everyone was on me, all good.
reminds me of Dunn's in Montreal.

{"text":"Being a jew from Montreal and growing up on Schwartz's the bar for smoked-meat is set pretty high. After a latake-less Rosh Hashanah, I sent my chai-walla (my assistant) to pick up a heavy order for our team. Our order consisted of smoked meat sandwiches, poutines and of course a large amount of latakes. To tell you the truth the next 30 mins were a blur and we all had to extend the Rosh Hashanah holiday and close down because we were all so full. That's how you know you've had a good smoked meat sandwich! Zane is the man."}
{"text":"Being small eaters, my friend and I shared the sandwich combo. Given all this talk about the smoked meat, we decided on the smoked meat sandwich, caplansky salad, to go along with the pickle and coleslaw. The sandwich was very good, but what was even better was the \"mild horse radish-like\" mustard! It was delicious! The other two were okay, but not as good as the \"mild horse radish-like\" mustard! The Caplansky salad was very good, and excitement level was upped by chick peas and alpha sprouts. 

The service was very good, and the food arrived on the table quite quickly. It had a very family-oriented feel, in which each waiter that passed by would genuinely ask if everything was to our likings. The best part was that Zane Caplansky himself is always present in the dining room, tending to things personally, and ensured customer satisfaction himself. 

My friend and I are 90% sure that Guy Fieri (from Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives) was there as well, sitting on the patio! That basically topped the experience for us!"}
{"text":"I know there are some deli freaks out there and this review is not for them.  Since moving into the Monarch, Caplansky's has provided me with many tasty meals on the fly.  Once in a while I'll eat-in but usually I'll just take a sandwich to go.  The meat is always moist and delicious.  I usually get the medium fatty version with the amazing house mustard and I'm never disappointed.  

I know they're opening up another location but I hope they keep the Monarch going.  It's one of the better places to watch sports in Little Italy and could definitely use the tasty smoked meat."}
{"text":"I had had a corned beef sandwich at Katz' Deli once years ago. Then I had one in Montreal at that famous Jewish deli there. On both occasions I enjoyed the sandwich immensely. It was delicious, it was big and the size matched the price - relatively. At Caplansky's however, what I got for $9.50, which ended up being $11.25 was a tiny little rye bread sandwich with just a bit of corned beef. Corned beef was good but it's hard to get that wrong. But maan it was expensive for the size. To make matters worse, I passed by Domino's pizza and they had a small pizza plus drink and something else in a combo for $5. Meanwhile my $11 corned beef didn't even have a slice of pickle."}
{"text":"The smoked meat was awesome, so good I went on line and read about your business, you definitely found your passion, thanks for making the airport a better place :)"}
{"text":"Friend brought me here for a smoked meat sandwich and poutine for a true Canadian food. I really like the sandwich . Not too meaty not too much it's really just a nice flavor and super friendly service for sure 

It's a must go for tourist for sure"}

Where is your Yelp presence at the airport?!!!

Next time I'm thru YYZ for sure I'm coming back to Caplansky's!"}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my boyfriend about a week ago. We both tried the smoked meat hash, which was good. There was a confusion with multiple waitresses serving a table but they provided good service. My boyfriend had to eat most of my food because I was way too full. Good serving sizes!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Gets a bit crowded on the weekend, but there is usually room at the bar. They have several great breakfast options, specifically scrambled eggs and fried salami which I love! The smoke meat sandwiches are just what you would expect. They have a very decent burger as well. Service is solid."}
{"text":"Memories of Schwartz's in Montreal came back to me when my told me about this deli.  I was told \"just as good as, if not better\"... wow, those are some fightin' words.

Located on College Street and just west of Spadina, Caplansky's has a similar location feel of Schwart'z.  Most delis like to situate themselves near the financial district or commercial locations due to swarms of lunch time customers but both establishments seem to do without.  And as a result, their dinner times equally as busy as their lunch times.

We stopped in around 8pm or so on a Friday night, but there were still a lot of people in there.  Most of them were foodies; no doubt came here because of the popular online reviews and the notable mention in the popular men's magazine Maxim as one of the 100 best delis in North America.  (I could tell that they were foodies because they were packing hand-cannons... or should I say Canons.. and were more occupied with taking high resolution porn shots of the sandwich cross section than actually enjoying the food)

They had a lot of carnivorous items on the menu, but at my first visit I always like to try what the house is known for.  With that in mind, we decided to opt for the sandwich combo, which was a choice of any sandwich and a side.  One smoked meat on rye paired with french fries, and one smoked turkey on rye paired with matzo ball soup.  After about ten minutes, the started trickling out from the pass one by one.  

Matzo Ball Soup:  Nice clear comforting broth... but the ball was a sinker.  I prefer the lighter ones that float.  But it was seasoned nicely and was a good soup.

French Fries:  Oooh yeah.  These rocked!  Hand cut, double fried, golden and crunchy.  Probably the best part of the meal.

Smoked Turkey:  Very impressive turkey!  Normally they have these things on the menu for the poor souls that do not eat red meat.  But I would actually order this again.  There was so much flavour here.  In fact, it may be the best turkey meat that I have ever had in a sandwich.

Smoked Meat:  Two words here... let down.  This was easily the fattiest  sandwich that I have ever been served.  Now, don't get me wrong, I normally like some fat but this was kind of ridiculous.  I mean, chunks and chunks of fat.  What gives?  A third of the sandwich was barely edible.  To be honest, the flavour was nothing to write home about either.  Yep, I have had better sandwiches at non-acclaimed places like Shopsy's.

Besides the final meat disappointment, I should mention that the service was very friendly.  In fact, it seemed like all the servers were very attentive to everyone.  The ambiance was a typical diner feel, albeit a little more cute with the retro style counters.

I would go back, but only for the turkey and their fries."}
{"text":"Just had a smoked meat sandwich and Caplansky salad combo.  Wow very tasty, I had the medium fat sandwich, so frigin good.  I could probably eat a few of these in one sitting.  I had to buy some meat to take home with me.  Great place, nice deli feel, meat is kosher (i was told), variety of mustards on the table (honey, horseradish, hot, many of which are made in house), nice pickle with sandwich.  Definitely would come back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I knew just by the smell in the restaurant when I walked in that I was in for a rough one. First let me start off by saying that I am an ex-montrealer and I know my smoked meat. When I walked in to Caplansky's I noticed that it was missing that smoked meat deli smell that I know and love... Strike one. The second thing I noticed when I was seated at my table is that there was a choice of mustards that included, super hot mustard and honey mustard. Dear Toronto, anything other than basic yellow mustard on a smoked meat sandwich is just wrong... Strike two. The third thing I noticed was that the gentleman that was cutting the meat was weighing it on a scale before constructing the sandwich. Where's the love?! Making a smoked meat sandwich is an art form. Depending on which part of the bread you get, you may not get an optimal bun to meat ratio... Strike three, you're out before my food even arrives.... But wait, there's more...

The meal finally arrived. I ordered a combo which came with a generous portion of decent fries and a smoked meat sandwich. I ordered my smoked meat medium because I'm not an idiot. The meat was very dry and lacked the classic smoked meat flavour. It tasted like a piece of meat that was picked and smoked by an amateur that didn't  quite get the hang of it yet.

I should also let you know that I went to this place with an open mind and very low expectations. It wouldn't take much to exceed my rock bottom expectations.

While this does not affect my rating, I feel compelled to let you know that the staff was very attentive and the service was good. Not good enough Caplansky's... Enjoy my $15, because you won't get any more from me..."}
{"text":"i want to like this place. independent. local. 

here's my suggestion: get higher quality meats. re-train staff. pay attention to detail. like you did with the logo and branding and you will do fine."}
{"text":"I've been to Caplanski's a few times and it's always a positive experience. Today it was a bowl of matzo ball soup, smoked meat fresser, latkes and a glass of Deli King lager. Can't say that I can complain about any of the food. It's all great. I love trying all five of the mustards.  Everything is served with a pickle on the side, including the beer. So, I've eaten a lot of pickles today, obv. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the price. It think you're paying a celebrity premium as it has become a Toronto destination."}
{"text":"Amazing little deli and patio. The brunch is fantastic and comes with latkes in lieu of traditional home fries with the choice of sour cream or apple sauce. If you go for lunch, the sandwiches are piled a mile high and come with the choice of a variety of mustards - highly recommend the honey. Fantastic place in the city."}
{"text":"After hearing numerous reviews on how amazing this place, I decided to give this place a try. It was freezing on the day I went and walking through the curtained door, we were greeted by the friendly waiter and shown our table. I noticed that they had their own home-made mustards and I love the fact that they do!

We were quickly given our water and menus. I ordered a Earl Grey tea, chicken matzo soup and hot deli corned beef sandwich. One of my friend ordered the Mac and Cheese while the other ordered the Smoked Meat sandwich. The food came relatively fast and each of the sandwiches came with a pickle.

My friend and I traded one halves of our sandwich, just so we could try both of them. The Smoked Meat and the Corned Beef was indistinguishable. A comment made by my friend was that it was really salty. 

One of the things that I was dissatisfied with the bread of the sandwich as it got soggy and the whole sandwich just fell apart. In the end, I just ate it with a fork. The meat of the sandwiches, although delicious was not all that special. However, I have to say it was good comfort food.

The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Never eaten here. See mixed reviews so next times in downtown Toronto will be sure to stop in and pick up a couple of sandwiches to take home and try."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is great. Had the Reubenesque which is basically smoked meat and Swiss melt with Russian dressing - it was light on the kraut. Sandwich was great. Smoked meat was delicious. I also tried a bit of the brisket which was good too. It seemed a little pricey for a sandwich but it was good food."}
{"text":"I think it's pretty sad that this is how we represent our city to travellers. New york has a shake shack in their airport, austin has a salt lick, Toronto's airport should have a Libretto/Terroni, La Carnita, Pho or Thai. Not this. 

When we went it was empty and our food came out looking ok. It was worse than the downtown location and cost more. I'm not saying there's any better options in the airport, but that's why you just shouldn't rat in airports."}
{"text":"Skip it.

This place started in the monarch and was really good. Even when they first opened on college it was good. But it is not good any more.

If it were to exist in a vacuum, it could be OK. But it has to live in a world where Schwartzes (sp?) and Katz' and a million other smaller delis exist. And it doesn't hold up. 

Add to that the ridiculous ego that Zane has, and you cannot support this spot. His line of mustards are bad, and the photos on them are too embarrassing to even look at. You can just tell this guy cares more about expanding than he does about the quality of his food. And if that's not the case, why was my sandwich so bad?"}
{"text":"Blankets of smoked meat covered in deli mustard and nestled between two warm slices of rye... How can you go wrong? Comfort food and kickass sandwiches. By far the best smoked meat sandwich in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is ok. This place is overpriced given the small portions.  Had a smoke meat sandwich, fries , and a Heineken for 22 bucks. The wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Caplansky's looking for breakfast. Coming from NYC, I was glad to see signs of a good deli-style restaurant. We enjoyed lox, potato pancakes and smoked meat hash. Good service and good food makes this a great choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"My dad loves a good deli sandwich, so he wanted to try this place out. We went for Father's Day dinner, and I was expecting a big crowd, but it was pretty dead when we got there. 

When we arrived we were prompted greeted. The weather looked nice, so we wanted to dine al fresco, but after a few minutes after we were seated on the (pretty big) patio it started raining. Our server quickly helped us move to another table on the patio that was covered by a canopy. 

Our server was awesome. Hands down, the best restaurant service we've had in a while. He was super friendly. Genuine. None of that fake stuff. He knew the menu well, so he was able to suggest a lot of different things. You could tell he knows a lot about smoked meat too. 

The menu is quite extensive. But I decided to go with something simple, so I ordered a smoked meat sandwich with latkes (the apple sauce that comes with the latkes is amazing!). My dad ordered the same and my mom ordered What Zane Eats, which is grilled versht (basically spicy salami), liver, chopped red onions, and honey mustard. She also had their beet borsht to start, which she loved. I had a taste, and it I thought it was pretty good since I don't really like beets. The cold soup was perfect on a hot day like today. We all shared their mac and cheese. It was good. Very creamy. My sandwich was really good too. I liked the assortment of mustards they had on the table for you to spread onto your sandwich. The five latkes were flavourful. I could have got a bigger sized sandwich, but I'm glad I didn't. I was so full that my parents had to finish my latkes.  

I'll definitely be back to try something on their breakfast menu. And my dad works downtown and has seen their food truck, so I think he's gonna give them a visit soon."}
{"text":"Bbq beef brisket sandwich was good but a bit too sweet. Child friendly and easy to find parking nearby. Lots of construction going on in the neighborhood which was a bit annoying. Fries are OK. Smoked meat OK. Waitstaff professional and experienced. Decor unique and comfy. Bathrooms reasonably clean. Way too many flies made it a little annoying. More hype than anything."}
{"text":"Caplansky's is a place that hits home.

I usually do the 1lbs'er with a side of pickles.  The meat is very tender and moist.  I especially can tasted the rendered fat that the meet absorbs which give it a bit of extra dimension.  Also, the brine salt does its job well too.

The beef tongue is to die for as well.  You'll never think something sounds that gross will be that tasty.  It's just really worth a try.  I was given a sample when asked.

Also, I have to say the corned-beef and has is pretty awesome too.  Its a mixture of has and beef topped with eggs.  Above average dish for what it is.

Overall, the place is decent, with friendly - although sometimes slow - service.  It's definitely a 3.5 and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I really enjoyed Caplansky's - a lot and even though we got take out. The Sandwiches are super soft and piled with meat, the latkes were numerous and tasty. Looking at the menu, I'll definitely be back to indulge. Also, it was nice to see Zane Caplansky at his establishment serving the customers. Awesome. Recommend/two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Been shopping. It's saturday afternoon. We're hungry. We're around college and spadina. We're picking up some electronics from the great local places around there. 
Caplanskis! Heard about it, hadn't been. 
So we stop in. Not too hungry, but just enough to share. A beer is in order also. 
Wow, great sandwich. Service, however, was awkward and in a daze. Forgot to bring beer on drinks order. Food runner with sandwich walked around the room for 5 min looking for us. 
All made up by great smoked meat. 
Yep. Heading back soon."}
{"text":"Classic smoked meat sandwich joint. Great lunchtime spot . When I was there my order got messed up and it took twice as long as my friend - but they were very apologetic and gave me a free appetizer while I waited. That the kind of service I appreciate.

The smoked meat isn't as good as Schwartz's but that is a given. It is a valiant effort and is my 2nd favourite smoked meat place."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that will not disappoint. The Knish is worth trying for sure. But, to be honest, everything thing the wait staff brought out from the kitchen looked amazing."}
{"text":"Born in Toronto, decided to finally check out Zane's after hearing him all the time on CFRB's \"Let's Eat\" show.  The kishka was disappointingly dry and also served in a bizarre way of separate cut up pieces, which made it even drier.  Kishka should be moist and soft, the \"kishka discs\" we're microwaved stucco.  Sent back the 2 very small blueberry blintzes as they were not traditional, looked frozen/microwaved, and had tasteless filling, no sweetness, nothing remotely resembling the taste of a proper blintz.  I've had better fresh blintzes from Metro!  Avoid if you're smart."}
{"text":"Pas mauvais, mais pas g√©nial. Ils font beaucoup dans le c√¥t√© marketing, c'est travaill√© comme image mais pas tr√®s attachant. 

Un go√ªt peu raffin√© : trop d'a√Øl, trop de sucre et trop de sel dans les sauces. J'y ai gout√© un 'beef brisket' relativement gras avec pommes de terre en pur√©e. Ma compagne avait command√© un 'mac & cheese', c'est √† dire des p√¢tes sauce fromage. J'y retournerai sans doute pour le petit d√©jeuner. Je pr√©f√®re de loin Yitz's sur Eglinton. C'est pratique dans le genre si vous √™tes dans le quartier, mais ce ne sera pas une exp√©rience culinaire, loin s'en faut."}
{"text":"great lunch.  meat had a bit more fat than expected but it didnt hurt the flavour. charging for a refill on pop is a bit cheap even for a deli.  sevice was very good."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during a snowstorm. It's a deli/diner. You come, sit, order food and go. I've tried the smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal and could not understand the hype. It just tastes buttery and whatever other flavors are from sauces like ketchup or mustard. So, I ordered their stew for dinner. It tasted just like any other stew, but a bit sweeter (Maple Syrup, maybe?) Portion was gigantic, though. So big that I have no room for desserts. Will I come here again? Probably, their Jewish menu seems interesting."}
{"text":"As someone who aims to be an everyman's advisor on Toronto's casual food scene, it's more than mildly embarrassing to have had to admit that I had not yet sampled the smoked meat stylings of one Zane Caplansky. On Friday I put those days behind me and enjoyed the company of the talented foodtographer Neil T as I bit into my first Toronto Smoked Meat sandwich at the new College Street location, atop Augusta Street and next to the former home of his grandfather's hardware store.  To me, there's something about this \"homecoming\" element of Caplansky's story that adds a dimension of small-town, old-time charm to the experience he offers.


Though I've never met him, the man himself deserves a paragraph. He tweets. He blogs. He rants about small explosions in his own kitchen, and raves about the food coming out of others. In a recent caught-on-twitter conversation, he tactfully posted (in response to a rather pointed comparison), \"I make no claim on being Schwartz's...Just trying to do my best.\" Indeed, Caplansky's offering is no Montreal wannabe; as Toronto Life put it in their Here's The Beef feature, his Toronto smoked meat has taken its Montreal progenitor and \"married it with Texas-style barbecue brisket,\" rubbed with spices from Little India before curing and smoking.


On entry, the first thing to notice is the smell. The aroma from the smokers fills the dining room, even on a gorgeous day with all the patio doors open. Dining al fresco came at a price for us; we enjoyed the fresh air of College Street from the side patio but missed out on this pleasantly rich scent as we dined. 


Our casual-but-professional server was at our side in moments, talking me knowledgeably through a short-but-sweet local-only beer list (King Pilsner,  Duggan's Number 9, Mill Street Organic and Denison's Dunkel) and offering his advice when I hesitated for just a moment on my smoked meat sandwich order (\"Go with fatty; you won't regret it). Neil has never looked back since one of the servers advised he same, with an encouraging \"That's how I get it.\" Delivering top-quality service in a laid-back, jeans-and-a-t-shirt environment is no easy feat, but I think it's been achieved here.


Food arrived fast and fresh. My 7oz smoked meat sandwich was a perfect portion, creeping over the edges of the thin-sliced rye holding it together. As this was my first tasting, I sampled two of the three mustards on offer, skipping the polish mild and going for the extra hot and the standard brown. Both were excellent complements, though not essential if you're not a fan of this seedy spread. I personally recommend a swipe of the hot stuff, and will stick with that forthwith. My smoked meat poutine was also very good; the fries were some of the best I've had and the smoked meat and cheese curd topping, while decent, just couldn't keep up with the sandwich. Worth trying for the novelty, but I just don't think a poutine topping is the right implementation for smoked meat. I still regret passing up the soup du jour, split pea and smoked meat. Neil marked my inaugural visit by trying something new, and was thoroughly satisfied with his barbecue brisket on an onion bun. 


At $11, the lunch sandwich combo (a sandwich and any side) is a great value. Beer with a meal like that is a must for me, and I paid just $6 for my pint. Desserts are available and are now made in-house (formerly, by Wanda's Pie in the Sky). I might have gone for one had I had a bit more room, but I had no intention of filling myself to the point of discomfort on such a nice day for an after-lunch walk in Kensington Market. Tax and tip in, my bill was $22."}
{"text":"You can smell the smoked meat as your walking down the street approaching this place!! Such a deliciously inviting aroma. It's a great place to sit and enjoy a patio meal and people watch on college street.

The smoked meat sandwich is absolutely divine. Add a little mustard from a variety of choices and you'll be in sandwich heaven. 
 
This place is a favourite of mine."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for 2 years and coworkers convinced me to go try it again. While there is an extensive menu the quality of the food is quite low. The smoked meat is quite lean which was great, but it is tasteless. Our fries were delivered to another table and then given to us cold. We sent them back 1 because we saw them put on the other table and 2 because cold fries are not good. The fresh lemonade does not taste like lemonade at all. It is very syrupy. The matzo ball soup is very salty and not at all what you woukd expect from a deli.  I was very disappointed with the latkas as well They were very oily and thin with very little taste. Our server was quite nice very friendly and chatty. If you are looking for a high quality deli I wouldn't recommend going here. I feel it's more about the theme than quality. If you are ok with mediocre food that will be served cold it's for you! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Took my two friends who'd taken me for Ethiopian food to experience \"Jewish cuisine.\" I really did the research here. It was here or Yitz's and I chose here. Super average, and our waitress was very unhelpful. She messed up my order for brisket and brought us a sandwich resembling pulled pork, then when they did bring the brisket it was dry square chunks in an average-to-almost-inedible sauce. Matzo ball soup was similarly disappointing. The biography on the website made me want to love this place, but even the reuben sandwich left much to be desired. The blintzes were good, I'll give them that. I would hold them responsible for the constant pestering by wasps, but I am sure that their patio just had a nest nearby. 
In any case, a pretty big disappointment. Even more disappointing is that I am pretty sure this is as good as it gets in Toronto."}
{"text":"Literally the worst food I've had in a long time. Horrible smoked meat sandwich, horrible and soggy greasy brisket sandwich. Decent chicken soup. Much rather go to Center Street Deli.. Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"In Toronto, this is the place for smoked meat. Full stop.  

I am a true connesueur of all things deli - Katz's in SoHo to (the late lamented) Wolfies/Rascal House in Miami, From Schwartz's to Corky &Lenny's in the land of Cleve all the way to Canters on Fairfax, one of the few good reasons to visit Los Angeles - THIS man knows and loves his deli.  

Walking in to Caplansky's one is immediately greeted by the aroma of rich, delicious, smokey, briskety goodness - no, make that ...Greatness.  If they put that smell in a spray can it would be called \"Vegan Be Gone\"  The modern cleanliness is almost off-putting in terms of meat-cred, but there is something about the place (other than the amazing smell) that gives it a whiff of authenticity.  The servers are far too nice and conscientious to work in a proper deli, but this IS Toronto, so one has to make allowances.  

Caplansky's does have a very nice menu.  The purpose of this menu is for you to decide HOW you would like to consume your smoked meat on this visit.  Here are three methods that I can heartily recommend:

Sandwich/Platter - The meat here is fantastic and should certainly be enjoyed in the form preferred by purists as often as possible.  NOTE: A smoked meat sandwich consists of rye bread, smoked meat, and either yellow or brown mustard.  ANY OTHER INGREDIENT IS AN ABOMINATION.  Yeah - I'm talking to you Honey Mustard!  And you, if you ask for Miracle Whip again I will have you deported!

Smoked Meat Hash - Caplansky's for breakfast/brunch? Of course! Not only do they serve breakfast, but they serve it bountifully, beautifully, and dutifully until 4am on Friday and Saturday.  The hash here is what other hash aspires to be - lean fresh meaty - the perfect blend of veggies, meat and spices - How can something so simple be so good? Try - you'll be hooked.  (For those who like the sweet stuff The Leaning Tower is a sugar rush/coma on a plate - but what a way to go....)

Cabbage Borscht - Surprised? Me too! Ordered it one super cold day just to thaw out my frozen innards (only soup they had at that moment) and it is amazing! Big lean chunks of smoked meat in a fresh sweet and sour cabbage laced broth.  Like the best cabbage soup you ever had, only better.  Sorry Grandma... Unexpected and addictive.

In the interest of science and fair play I have actually tried some of the other items on the menu - there's a lot of good stuff here.  Zane is a true chef and some of the specials that I sampled surpass plates costing 5X at some of the more hyperbolic establishments around town.   Seriously, every special that I, or anyone that I have dined with, has met with nothing but unqualified raves.  

As I write these words of praise I can almost feel the collective angst of your invective flavoured water balloons being hurled in my direction. Ok naysayers - I'm ready. Pardon me while I slip on the outfit in order to play.....

Objection Deflection Ninja - Ha-Hah!  

It's not like Schwartz's - Duh! Even Schwartz's isn't like Schwartz's anymore! Since developers have decimated the competitive deli landscape in Montreal - The Great One (yes, Schwartz's is the Gretzky of Smoked Meat) has pared down the menu to the bare essentials in order to keep the price points democratic and the turnover high.  

It's not a REAL deli - That's true.  This most obvious fact almost led me to give the place a miss entirely.  It is, in fact, a \"deli-style\" restaurant.  Now typically - you put \"style\" after anything good and it denotes a pale imitation.  This is one of the primary reasons that I believe in maintaining a life as opposed to the more currently fashionable \"lifestyle\" Truth be told - I passed Caplansky's by more than a few times.  It isn't in the right neighborhood and it looked kind of...well - new.   One of the easiest tests for a proper deli is time and typically the good and authentic meter STARTS at the half century mark.  But this review isn't about the shell - it's about what's inside - the meat.

There's this place on Bathurst- Let me stop you RIGHT THERE.  \"This place on Bathurst\" has been phoning it in for years.  While your fathers uncles cousin Harvey may have experienced the sandwich of his dreams there in 1968 the earth has cooled considerably since then and so has the stuff coming out of there smokers.  If they even HAVE smokers.

Although the amazing smoked meat caused love at first bite, it actually took me several visits to truly appreciate the genius that is Zane Caplansky restauranteur.  He has taken the core elements of the class Jewish deli and added just the right amount of menu diversification and modernization to make a vital dining establishment for the 21st century.   Although I am not capable of doing what he does, I can offer him my highest praise, patronize his establishment regularly,  and do my bit to tell the world.  Are you listening world?"}
{"text":"Not a lot to add to what others said about pricing or food, it is in an airport after all.

We had a short layover at the airport and Caplansky's was next to our gate. The smell of it as we walked by was enough to get our attention and get us in the door. There is a seating area and a takeaway/ordering area, but I think both sections are still self serve. You order your sandwich and pay, then are given a number which is called out when your order is ready. We chose to split a turkey sandwich, the meat on these babies is generous and splitting it was probably the smart way to go to avoid subsequent meatmares on the last leg of our journey. After ordering, the waiting area for orders is a bit chaotic and there seemed to be some confusion to customers as to where to find their order numbers on their receipts or some not even having their receipt anymore. Pro tip: keep your receipt until you have your food. 

All in all, the food came out fast, it was a generous portion and the bread was toasted just right - not to much to cut up your mouth. If the lines not to long, this is a good choice to grab and go."}
{"text":"Impossibly bad. Dried out, machine sliced smoked meat. Split pea soup actually not terrible---but still very odd, and much worse than Habitant (unfair--since Habitant is an excellent product, absolutely excellent). Kind servers; I do not blame them. The meat was stunningly bad---so dried out and unloveable that it would not compete with supermarket smoked meat. I could go on. Perhaps the other menu items are better---but why should they be when a deli lives or dies by its smoked meat?"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this place for lunch - there wasn't much of a crowd so I figured I'd be in and out quickly
I asked for there signature sandwich. 
Five minutes later it came out  a small sandwich  with 7 chips  for $16.50 tax in .
Not sure what everone see in this place I could of gotten a veal down the street for $7.50  with more meat . The sandwich tasted good but very over priced. 
But with it being on college street and with hipsters wanting to burn money in there pocket maybe that's why they like it .
I could of bought a roast beef sub a jar of dill pickles and a bag of chips and had a better lunch .
See pictures of my sad small sandwich."}
{"text":"Place was dirty. 
Knish was cold. 
Waitress was rude and sneaky. (Decided to keep our change when we paid) 
Food was overpriced.
Smoked meat was good not great.
Beyonc√© has terrible taste in food.

Good day to you."}
{"text":"I had the smoked meat sandwich and I am willing to say it may actually be better than Schwartz's (in terms of what I prefer). It's actually different from Schwartz's which is a good thing, because it doesn't try too hard to replicate, but rather does it's own thing pretty well. The only thing I could say the sandwich could improve on is the mustard selection. If there was a choice for prepared mustard, it would've made it better.

The restaurant itself was nice. I sat outside on the patio on a nice summer day and everything was fantastic. Service was great and the servers were very friendly. 

The dessert was okay. I had the brownie, which was decent. It was a little on the cold side though."}
{"text":"Reading through some of the reviews on this site and others, you'd think the arrival of Caplansky's was the Second Coming.  I can assure you that it is not.  The fact that there are so many rave reviews really speaks to how deprived we are in Toronto of a decent deli.  To be fair though, it probably deserves 3 stars but I knocked it a notch because I had such high hopes from all the hype.

I really don't have a problem with a single offering on the menu - that's what Toronto food seems to be all about anyways - \"we're really good at one dish and the rest won't kill ya.\"  But really the one good thing they were supposed to be good at, the smoked meat , was sorely disappointing.  While the cuts were decent comparatively speaking to a lot of places in Toronto, it was indeed dry, and lacked flavour.  The rye bread slices were dull and also lacked flavour.  The only thing that was saving this sandwich was the great mustard they had.  The fries didn't fare much better, pedestrian at best.  Caplansky's ought to really focus on their best product and become a mustard bottler.  I had the platter and was not really full or satisfied.  

The service was very friendly, but a bit sloppy - I guess it's kinda hard to stay on top of things when there are two sets of staff in one place.  But the setup works in a odd kind of way - I guess not too far of stretch from when The Monarch's patrons used to bring their brown bag lunches to the bar.

So given our dearth of good delis in Toronto (really can't understand, given the large Jewish and Eastern European population in our city why there aren't more), are we to compare it only the sorry few that we do have here or do we go beyond?  Not sure, so, I would fare it 3-4 stars against other Toronto delis but a solid 2 if you compare it delis outside of our GTA boundaries.  It's really hard not to compare it to Montreal's Schwartz's...because they've set the standard so high.

My other gripe is the price - I know Toronto real estate isn't cheap, but given they're sharing space with Monarch's, couldn't they price that smoked meat sandwich a bit cheaper?  I'd rather spend a solid $5.20 on Schwartz's best vs. $7 a mediocre Caplanasky's.   Given there is little or no real competition for at least 500kms, they can charge whatever they want!  But really, value for money just isn't there.  But then again you can't play pool at Schwartz's after a sandwich and some slaw, so score a point for Caplansky.

A welcome addition to our city, but highly overrated (like Carnegie in NYC), good to check out at least once, or if you need something to hold you over until you can make that five hour drive to St. Laurent."}
{"text":"Updated to say we went again last night (in the hood craving smoked meat) and after our appetizer, the server cleared our plates and took our *dirty* cutlery off our plates, complete with gravy and food bits attached from the plate, and plunked them down on the table for us to reuse and possibly get norovirus.

If you don't know that it's not hygienic to put cutlery that's been in someone's mouth on a table that you wiped with a dirty cloth, and then expect them to put that same cutlery back in their mouths, you're gross and shouldn't be serving food to people in a restaurant. 

The burger was salty, onion bun burned and the knish was also way way too salty. The salad (once again, why am I so stupid?) was a bowl of boxed salty croutons with a cloyingly sweet dressing.

That's it. I swear. Not going back."}
{"text":"The service was good. The decor was original (however they could do something about the seating. The layout can be more efficient and the chairs/tables less generic). 

My gf ordered a smoked meat sandwich and she said it was good. My experience however was less than ideal. The turkey sandwich i got was smothered in gravy and would not fit on the bread that was served with it. Couldnt even finish it. I got comped on it. Had my sandwich been made better I would have given this place a minimum four star rating."}
{"text":"Just got back from this amazing deli for the 2nd time in a few hours. One of the wonderful girls at the cookbook store had tipped me off to this amazing place. We had dinner here last night that was soo good I was dreaming about smoked meat while I slept. So I had to get my fill again for breakfast ( lunch for some people). Being a chef I am proud to say this is one of the best meals I've ever had! Some may say that the menu is small, but it's much better to do a few things perfect then do 100 bad. This is a must stop for any foodie in Toronto! Now I'm off for a full glutanous and carnivourise day headed to black hoof!"}
{"text":"After a visit to the ROM, we were looking for a place to grab a quick bite before leaving to head back to the States. Lucky for us, we noticed this in our Yelp search. I didn't even realize that Caplansky's was famous from being on the Food Network (the original location, at least) but I can see why. 
Our food was delicious. You order at the counter and then take your number to your seat where they will bring your food. There's a mustard and pickle bar in the upstairs dining area (but I don't like either, so I didn't try it.) I had the Classic breakfast which was just what I was craving. The latkes with applesauce and the bacon were delicious. My companion enjoyed the reuben sandwich. 
I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area to try more!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to have a Caplansky's sandwich a week after having a Schwartz's sandwich. 

Caplansky's seems like a quirky place with the signs they have posted around.  I had a good chuckle at some of the signs.  We sat down and I looked over the menu and definitely wanted a smoked meat sandwich and ordered the poutine as well.

The price is a bit more steep than Schwartz's but it's a different town so I was hoping the quality would be good like Montreal.

They brought me my poutine and sandwich.  The poutine did not look appetizing but I tried it and it's ok at best.  The smoked meat doesn't really go well with the poutine.

I looked at my sandwich and it's a pretty decent size and comes with a pickle wedge and some slaw.  Upon first bite of the sandwich I realized that I was definitely pleased.  It doesn't have the wow that Schwartz's carry's but is definitely a very good sandwich.  As with all deli sandwich's you should get the medium fat sandwiches.  The lean sandwich's are always dry!

Give it a medium sandwich a shot and I'm sure some of the other sides are better than the poutine."}
{"text":"The College st. location is closed. Mazel Tov.
But you can find the food truck parked in Kensington Market in front of Tom's Place 190 Baldwin St. I had the wiener schnitzel cooked in schmaltz, it is delicious and only 2 for $5
Zane also has a radio show on CFRB 1010 Saturday mornings 11am for all the fans"}
{"text":"Not bad for a smallish brisket sandwich or better yet some meat for takeout.

I wish the place was more than it is. If the food menu options were all reliably good to amazing and fair priced, I'd be here all the time. It often looks nearly deserted.

Also it's grubby even by relaxed Toronto standards. The washroom needs a good bath. Such a nice space and has potential, work on the details guys - or at least do fewer things really well and not just let everything go. It's as if they tested out a pretty good deli menu, hired some students, and ran away.

Three stars for hoping they read this and are all over it..."}
{"text":"First time trying the food. Definately coming back. My hubby & I tried the BLT sandwich, latkas and beef bacon donuts. Our server was great, we told her we were sharing so she brought us half the sandwich on two seperate plates. Really enjoyed sitting on the patio watching the hustle and bustle on College St."}
{"text":"Had an awesome pulled brisket sandwich - delicious and with crispy fried onions on top! It was a generous portion of the brisket, too.

Waitress was sweet and attentive. Coffee was refilled often. We decided we'd be back another day!"}
{"text":"Being from Montreal I often get asked what foods I miss most from back home. One of my answers is a typical one: Smoked Meat... from Schwartz's!

I've heard about Caplansky's here in Toronto. Well a few weeks ago I finally tried it. 

THE VERDICT: Very disappointing and definitely doesn't come close (at all) to Montreal Smoked Meat - especially from Schwartz's. 

The meat is more like thin cold cuts vs. juicy (and fatty) meatiness. The fries were not great either. And frankly, the price was too high for the quality of food. Sad face.

If you know and love great smoked meat Montreal-style - skip this place."}
{"text":"As an East Coast transplant to SF, I get homesick for proper deli.  Fatty cuts of meat piled high on rye bread? It's just  not something we do on the Left Coast.  It's not even raw or vegan and where oh where would you put the avocado?  

So imagine my delight when my Toronto crew took me to Caplansky's for their smoked meat sammich.  SO MUCH DELIGHT!  I've also tried their potato latkes and they are amazing.  

Protip: Ask for extra applesauce if you're getting the latkes. They give away mustard like it's going outta style but if you are a latke-dippin fiend, you're bound to need more than the thimble-sized serving they bring to the table."}
{"text":"If you have the kaunas to pay/charge 9.95 for a smoked meat sandwich that would starve a squirrel...good grief this place was disappointing. It's a like a hipster parody of they think a modern hip Jewish deli should be. Back in the tri-state NY area where I grew up this place wouldn't last long. What's with that wimpy slice of seedless rye on that smoked meat sandwich?...I didn't order a sandwich that was designed for a 5 year old stomach. Plus who puts French's yellow mustard on any deli sandwich? The mustard rack wasn't cute..you aren't at a BBQ joint, you're doing deli (spicy brown is ALL).  Where I come from this place would be called skimpy and half-assed. If you and your city are still convincing yourself you are \"World Class\", start serving a sandwich that isn't a bleeping mega price product mismatch that would put hunger pangs on a small rodent. Two points are largely for a friendly staff... Get some training on how a real deli operated (Go to Sarges in NYC...). Too many of these Toronto eateries are image first, but the product is sadly the proof..."}
{"text":"I think I've been to all the smoked meat joints in Toronto, and some of these restaurants come close to Montreal's and NYC's smoked meats, however, Caplansky is not one. Smoked meat was dry and not very flavourful at all. They had deep fried pickles which were not amazing either. They were surprisingly spicey. They refunded the order."}
{"text":"Meat.  Everything smells like delicious meat.

We decided that tonight would be a good night for smoked meat sandwiches.  After living in Montreal, this is probably the first time I've had smoked meat since I moved back to Toronto.

My expectations were high... 
Caplansky's is good...
But didn't quite rock my sandwich world.

I ordered the smoked meat dinner sandwich combo ($12) and had smoked meat poutine as my side.  I was trying to maximize my smoked meat intake.

They didn't ask me if I wanted a \"fatty\" sandwich, then again I had just come from yoga and I was still in yoga gear...still I would have chosen fatty if they had asked.  :(

The rye bread was fresh with a crispy crust.  There was the perfect amount of meat so that you could still pick up the sandwich and eat it.  Unlike Schwartz's where you get a plate of meat and the bread seems more like a side.  

The meat had a nice smokey flavor and not too salty.
I smothered my food in the Dijon horseradish mustard and enjoyed each bite.  The meat wasn't fall apart soft, but still tender.

The poutine was okay.
I would have liked more gravy...the fries were soggy... there were a few curds (at least there were curds and not shredded cheese).  The smoked meat was chopped and mixed in with the gravy.  I think I prefer having the smoked meat just piled on top.  

The meatloaf was a large portion, I found that the tomato sauce really overpowered the smoked meat in the meatloaf.  I think I will just stick to the sandwiches.

This is a great deli that does smoked meat Caplansky style.  
If you are on College street and want smoked meat, check this place out!"}
{"text":"THE SMOKED MEAT IS EXCELLENT.
^^Read this to yourself three times, then please, continue.

THE SHORT
The flavour of my sandwich was surprisingly good. 
I mean, it was OFF THE CHARTS. 
^^Yes, the caps are necessary; No hyperbole here.
I was truly shocked at how good it was, and I am a Katz's guy. 

THE REST
I found the meat in my sandwich a little too peppered. 
Since I've only been there once, I can't say if it's the standard or just a case of a peppery cut.

The kishke dish was a welcome sight on the menu, and was consumed in a hurry. Next time I will order a double portion (You only get three pieces, I was thinking 4 for the price).

I found the meat to be a little too peppery, but that is my own bias.
But again, the flavour! It was just great. 

The prices are good for what you get, and everyone at my table was happy with what they got.

We were there on Thanksgiving Day, and got there right in time - A giant line had formed in our wake. My sandwich was forgotten, but when our server checked up and realized the error, I got one in a hurry. It was OK by me since what I was brought was piping hot. 

I'm also glad to see hand cutting of the meat. It really does make a difference in the sandwich. I've eaten at two top delis in NYC - on the same day, lunch and dinner - and I could tell the difference.

It was good to see Zane working the holiday like his staff, and he was more than happy to bring around a sample of tongue to our table when my friend asked if  had any. And the tongue was 
FAN-TASTIC. If they have it when you are in, try it. 
Tell yourself it's caviar if you have to.

The service was uneven, but the food was bang on.
Better than the other way around, no? 

You need to go to Caplansky 's a.s.a.p. 
This place is a gem and Toronto should count itself lucky to have it.

Also, thanks to Zane for bringing back Jewish deli to Toronto."}
{"text":"I enjoy Caplansky's every time I come here. I just tried the pickled tongue for the first time and it was so delicious. I don't know why it's called \"pickled\" because it doesn't taste like pickles, but it is tender and interestingly textured with just a little bit of fatiness, and well seasoned. I also really like the smoked meat and the beef salami. 

Last time I went, I discovered \"the platter\" and I think it's a great deal. For $24, you get to try all the meats - smoked meat, beef salami, beef tongue, chopped liver, and smoked turkey.  It comes with a huge stack of rye bread, and is best to split between two people or maybe three if you're not that hungry. The only thing I didn't really like on the platter was the smoked turkey because I found it a bit dry.

The macaroni and cheese with smoked meat is also delicious ($9 for mac and cheese, +$2 for smoked meat).  Actually, everything I've had there (and I think I've been through most of the menu) is well done and the quality of the food here is very consistent. You can also order traditional Jewish food like gefilte fish, knish, matzoh ball soup, etc. I will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is a great staple in Toronto. I have been to the location on college and in Yorkville. You get large portions and they have a delicious pickle bar. The latkes are my fave. Great patio too, very small in Yorkville location. Give it a try if you're feeling some smoked meat!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says, I LOVE Caplansky's. 

Their smoked meat is amazing, and I was THRILLED on a recent visit (Dec '12) that they had gotten gluten-free bread (major score). Back in my pre-gluten free days, I LOVED the latka's (amazing with apple sauce) and their bread pudding (the perfect combo of pudding and cake, and totally delicious). Oh, and my boyfriend and I love the 'Super Extra Hot' mustard so much we now keep it at home.

The servers are always friendly, and I've never had any issues with the wait times. If I lived closer, I'd probably be here every week."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was ultimately disappointed by this place. I had been salivating over this place since it started during up on my way to work a few months ago. The thought of having a real jewish deli downtown was pretty exciting, alas I left pretty disappointed. The smoke meat sandwich was good, but I wanted a lot more from it. I mean a smoked may sandwich at a jewish deli should be a spiritual experience and I found my self feeling rather hoo-hum about the whole thing. The servings are large and the service was pretty good so at least it has that."}
{"text":"$40 for lunch a lunch for two that didn't include alcohol? Not worth it. This place is no Shwartz's. Portion size doesn't match the $$."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch today after a long absence from a dissapointing meal last year or so.  But today i had memories of the Monarch Tavern era.  The smoke meat sand. was so moist and less smoke, just perfect.  Loved it so much took home 1 1/2 pds. for dinner sandwiches for fam.  My lunch guest who graciously took care of the bill did the same.  We also order latkes they are tasty crunchy served with the obligatory apple sauce/sour cream.  One note i think they are deep fried not really counting calories if i'm going here for lunch but for some may not suit.  The in-house made cheesecake is creamy dreamy.  Matzo ball soup lacks flavour boo hoo!  Service is oh so friendly but could have used a few more hands on deck for smoother transitions.  Happy days are here again for me and caplansky.

$37 for lunch
$27 x 2 for take out."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for their weekday $5 inhouse draft. The pickled tongue or Reuben alone always satisfies my hunger pangs. When I want to go all out I'll order a soup or knishke or latkes and a main with my partner, who will order his smoked meat sandwich super fatty. I dare say the meat here is better than Schwartz in montreal. And their pickle goes with everything ESP the beer! Service speed varies but the waiter is always attentive. Sometimes there's flies inside and the outdoor patio is a bit bird poopy but that didn't bother me. The best of all worlds is that dish with the turkey on challah that is so surprisingly moist and tender, covered with gravy and cranberry jam. Something about that is super comforting though I had never grown up in a culture that celebrates Judaism or thanksgiving."}
{"text":"I am a huge lover of corned beef (and pastrami)...so when visiting Toronto we just HAD to make a visit to Caplansky's for a smoked meat sandwich.  Man am I glad we did!

I ordered a \"plain\" smoked meat sandwich (medium fattiness,,,they ask and you get to choose your level) and selected matzo ball soup as my side dish (you could also have latkes or a side salad).  We also ordered a plate of latke poutine for the table to share.  They did have an interesting draft beer being served (with a pickle spear on top)...but i opted for one of my favorite sodas of all time, Black Cherry.

Started with the matzo ball soup which had great chicken broth flavor and a fluffy matzo ball.  A few small carrot pieces added for flavor / color.  I really enjoyed this traditional soup.

The latke poutine was an interesting twist on the original, with bits of the smoke meat piled onto latkes covered with cheese curds and sauce drippings.  I would say that it was only okay.  On to the main event!

The sandwich was served \"spartan\"...rye bread, meat and a pickle spear.  The table offered four different mustards to choose from:
- Traditional ballpark
- Mild and Delicious
- Hot and Horseradishy
- Super Extra Hot

I my mind, the clear winner was the \"Hot and Horseradishy\"...so much so that I bought a jar to take home!  It was the perfect compliment to the smoky meat, so much so I think i could have drank the stuff (did I mention that i love mustard?!?!?).  Seriously though...I usually like to get these kinds of sandwiches in a Reuben format, but I'm so thankful I chose to go meat and bread only as the simple combination allowed the mustard to stand out and the meat to really shine.

Any time I return to Toronto, this place will most definitely be part of my foodie pilgrimage."}
{"text":"The last thing that I should be eating is a smoke meat sandwich. Let's not  tell my dietician. Caplansky is a secret craving. So sometimes I sneak over to their Yorkville location and fress. Zane, why no diet Vernors? That's my only complaint and it's  said \"tongue in cheek \" with ballpark mustard all over my face, fingers, and napkin. Sit in the park and people watch while you enjoy. There are tables and chairs. Beware... the pigeons are watching you. They want your leftovers.  Like I would have leftovers from Caplansky."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style deli restaurant has a bar Seating and TV screens.  Music was a little loud for a cafe.  Soup and Greek salad were good.  Large windows.  Good for an airport."}
{"text":"Overall a very pleasant experience.  Our server was energetic, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about everything on the menu, and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the beer collection they have available.  I got the Knish, which was fantastic (but not nearly as big as the portion you see on diners, drive-ins, and dives).  My girlfriend got a classic turkey sandwich, and we were both loving the different varieties of mustards available on the table.  My only complaint about the food was the side of potato salad I ordered, it had far too many onions in it, to the point where that's all I could taste throughout the meal and quite frankly the rest of the day.  But overall, a pretty great experience, I would definitely go back again when in Toronto."}
{"text":"I didnot liked the smoked meat , burger was average and mac &cheese was below average. Staff were polite, their signiture draft beer was very good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, after passing by this place for years. Should have gone earlier!
I tried the Jewish pierogies (contained ground beef filling), and garnished with well-done bits of bacon. Came with a side of sour cream. They served about 10-12 pierogies in total on the plate. WOW! It was a party in my mouth! I would totally recommend this dish for anyone! It was savoury, cooked to perfection (not too mushy or too starchy), and fairly priced.

My only criticism would be to add more pierogies! And perhaps, douse them off before serving them in a pool of oil. 

The staff were super friendly and attentive. We were served right away when we walked in, and got the nice corner seats with double windows! :)

I would most definitely come back here and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:25am. Store is closed yet online & store signs state you open for 10:00am on Sundays.

I recommend updating your hours of operation."}
{"text":"There's only a handful of world class delis in North America. If you've been to LA, Brent's is the pinnacle, but you can't discount Cantor's. In NYC, no one will dispute Katz's and Harold's in New Jersey. Shapiro's is a sleeper in Indy. In Eastern Canada, Schwartz's is the pinnacle with Dunn's taking a backseat. In the GTA, we haven't found a Jewish deli other than Caplansky's that does better with classic deli offerings and while it may be a tad behind the curve of the above restaurants, it's darn close. 

Hands down, when in the GTA, this is a must visit. You'll be pressured to find better deli food and while their poutine can be awesome and more than filling, you'll be best served to choose a smoked meat sandwich. Honestly, would you go to a hamburger joint and order a pizza? When at Caplansky's, stick to the deli items and you'll be a lifelong customer. And, give their split pea soup a try, it's darn good. 

It seems a few people are spooked by the price. This is top-quality deli meats, meaning you have to pay more for them. You'll understand why it's more expensive with your first bite and if you lived in LA, like I do, you'd think this is cheap. Give this place a try, whether in town as a tourist, a local in need of a bite or someone looking to try a different type of food. You can't go wrong with any of the soups/sandwiches here."}
{"text":"This place has it rough. First of all, it's a Jewish deli in the midst of freak flag waving Kensington market, so you don't really get the same vibe that you might at a place like Schwartz's in MTL where you're sure to be sitting beside Mr. and Mrs. Abramovitch kvetching about something instead of dealing with crazy crack-heads trying to shake parking meters loose. That being said, they are clearing doing the best they can. The only question is, is it good enough?

Ultimately, that depends on expectations. I have been twice and both times had the smoked meat sandwiches with fries and a beer. The first time I went was a Tuesday lunch. The smoked meat came out a bit dry for my liking, as if they hadn't been keeping it steamed like most smoked meat places do. The rye was also a bit stale, the crust tough to get off, which lead to some structural issues with the sandwich. On the other hand the fries were great. The pickle was a pickle. But all that ran me a good $15, closer to $20 with tip. For a Tuesday lunch, I was not impressed.

Craving the sweet, sweet embrace of brisket, I returned last night. The meat remained disappointingly dry, and the bread was still far from fresh (more likely bought on sale at Metro than baked in house) but the fries were good. I had a weird beer that I'd only seen on sale at Caplansky's which was a bit dark for my liking, especially on a bajillion degree day here in Toronto, but not bad. The waitress was great - very, very friendly and joking around with all the tables. We got our food fairly quickly and got refills on water as soon as we needed them, but not cloyingly. In retrospect the meal was virtually the same as it was that Tuesday I went. Only this time, I was going for dinner so spending closer to $20 wasn't so bad and I was a bit more prepared for sub-Montreal smoked meat, so the disappointment had less sting.

If you're in the downtown area, it's definitely the best you're going to get without driving way north on Bathurst. If you're prepared for a less than perfect meal at a slightly-higher-than-it-should-be price, this will definitely satisfy a smoked meat craving. If you want perfection, you'll have to get on the 401 and drive east, because TO simply doesn't have the same caliber as Montreal."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant this was great!  We split a huge and very tasty Greek salad with a dressing made in house and a mac and cheese which was yummy as well.  Best food I ever had at the airport."}
{"text":"The Montreal smoked meat sandwich is great. Pretty close to the real thing (Schwartz's in Montreal). I LOVE that they have Cott's Black Cherry soda... It goes so well with the sandwich. 

The pickled plate was awesome.

House mustard selection is good. The hot and horseradishy mustard isn't really that hot. The spicy mustard has a good kick, though. 

The latkes are good. 

Way too expensive, though. Two sandwiches (which aren't very large) in combos (one fry one latkes) with two sodas was $36."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE FRENCH TOAST. 

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

IT TASTES LIKE NORMAL FRENCH TOAST. 

Also, the bacon is really good."}
{"text":"I should have had the Rubenesque. With a name like that how could I have passed it up?  Smoked meat and swiss with saurkraut on grilled rye.... *sigh*  Next time for sure. But alas tonight I ordered the Caplansky Burger. $13 for a burger (fries cost $4 extra).  The patty was excellent. Juicy, tender and tasty topped with lettuce, sliced tomato and red onion (+$1 for cheese), del8cious dill pickle spear on the side.  The bun is where they lost me.  Sesame challah. Sounds great.  Unfortunately it was a dry sponge that soaked up all my condiments.  I should have asked for rye bread instead.  

My fianc√©  had the smoked meatloaf which was quite good.  Classic tender savoury with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.

Was glad to see Caplansky's where the crummy old Beaches Boardwalk Cafe used to be.  Service was very quick and very friendly.  Will definitely go back next time but next time I have a date with that Rubenesque...."}

{"text":"First of all the smell in this place it is so overpowering it almost made me nauseous... the food-pricey is not the word for overcooked fries, i guess since it was poutine maybe we got the oldest fries they had all for $11.00, the meatball sandwich also $11.00 for 3 meatballs on a dry baguette...the stuffed french toast was just ok could use some flavour for $15.00...the service was attentive however lacked enthusiam"}
{"text":"I had heard it was good and after finally driving out there on a lunch hour, it was pretty far from the office, it turned out to be overpriced and a dried out smoked meat sandwich.  Paid for it and througt Nie Wieder.   Try Dunn's downtown instead, or Peter's on Eglinton in Mississauga."}
{"text":"If you like smoked meat, this is the place to go.

We had heard about this place on the TV show \"You gotta eat here\" and marked it for a visit while we were in Toronto for the Waterfront Festival.

It's a long walk from the waterfront, but we think it was worth it.

We arrived at around sometime after 2pm and were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive. I had a traditional smoked meat sandwich with fries (and a pint of Steam Whistle), and my wife had the Knish. For my sandwich I had the option of lean meat, or fatty. I went for the fatty.

It was delicious. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Knish (her first) as well. When we were done, our server asked us if we wanted dessert. At first we said no, but she mentioned a couple of items and one of them was maple bacon doughnuts. She described them as 3 doughnuts similar to Timbits. We couldn't resist and we did not regret it. Mmmm....

One thing to note, the washrooms in the basement have a low ceiling. If you're taller than 6'3\", you'll need to duck. :)"}
{"text":"The sign outside reads \"New menu, same bad service\" but I kind of don't get it because a.) I've never really had issues with the service (though I've heard others complain endlessly) and b.) because I don't want a new menu!!! That's the thing with Jewish deli, it's classic! Don't change a thing - there's no need to update.

With that said, I really do like Caplansky's - though it's the old classics that I come back for: chicken soup with matzoh balls, smoked meat sandwiches, brisket, chopped liver and pickles. But why, WHY did you mess with kishka? There is no need to add smoked meat to every item on the menu, in fact my heart can't take it! (I mean literally, it's already a heart attack waiting to happen - why add more salty salty meat to things like gravy?)

Anyway, I'm still a fan! Even if it's not how my the matriarchs of my family would make it. Side note: I brought my aunt here once and she almost rolled up her sleeves and challenged the cooks to a duel."}
{"text":"Let's start with my cup came filthy. It actually looked like it wasn't washed at all. The tea I ordered had no flavor at all. There is really nothing good here for vegetarians. I tried to order a fruit cut they came back said they had no fruit. Luckily my gf gave me one of her potato pancakes, that was good at least."}
{"text":"The smoked meat here is not up to Montreal standards but is nonetheless delicious. I really enjoyed the burger made from a combination of ground beef and ground smoked meat. Beer, as always, is wet and refreshing."}
{"text":"After seeing Caplansky's on Dragons Den (four times?), I was so very excited to stop in and try it for myself! I wanted to see whether it would be a yes for me. Turns out it was a meh.

I got the smoked meat lunch classic, which was some pretty good value for what I got. I found the meat to be waaaay too salty though. The first flavour I got was salt and not yummy smoked meat flavour. The fries on the side were soggy and greasy. It was really quite disappointing after all of the hype.

The service was quick though and the honey mustard was bomb."}
{"text":"Admittedly, before last week, I had never eaten anything from any location of this famed Toronto Delicatessen. I have my spots for authentic deli cuisine and was all set. After being disappointed with my smoked meat sandwich at their departure location in Terminal 1 when my flight was cancelled I was a little hesitant when our dinner options were limited to Tim Hortons and the full 'sit-down' Caplansky's in T3 of Pearson.

I've always said that I'm about second chances and for the most part that's true (save for a few abominations that shall remain nameless), but I gotta tell you, in this instance I'm glad I was forced to give CD's another whirl.

Having some time to kill before our flight we decided to get some food and drink and I agonized about what to have knowing I didn't want another smoked meat sandwich. I noticed a small \"YGEH\" next to a few menu items and asked what the 'buzz wuz' on these. Our server informed me that those items were the ones featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Well then - that's a different story!

After looking over my options I handily went with the homemade meat loaf option paired with mash and veggies. Good old fashioned comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you sleepy for a flight. 

The veggies were nothing special, just a steamed assortment it seemed, similar to what my fiancee received in her veggie sandwich - not exactly original. The mashed taters were light and nicely whipped but spuds all the same. The meatloaf was the real winner here IMO. Soft and moist, not even a little bit dry, meaty (obviously), well seasoned, and a MASSIVE portion, I was stuffed by the end, and nicely topped with a sweet tomato sauce - definitely NOT ketchup!

Definitely a much better experience vs the take away option in T1 of the airport. I'd definitely eat here again!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This place has got Great atmosphere, and the food keeps up.  Delicious soups, good bread, but of course the main attraction is the smoked meat.  I don't eat meat, but people rave, so there's gotta be something going on there.

Cheaper than a trip to New York."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place a couple years ago - the smoked meat was amazing, but when I went back recently, it was disappointing. The smoked meat is no longer stacked generously, but cut rather thick and no longer as tender."}
{"text":"The best sandwich is the smoked tongue. You need nothing else. We had the sample platter the first time we went and got to try out all the different fillings (liver pate, smoked meat etc) and the tongue one is unbeatable! Don't be deceived by the word tongue. Super worth it.
Big lines for brunch, arrive early or avoid brunch. The menu is the same anyway..."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????1????2??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came just today for Sunday lunch, and not sure if it's just me, but their portions seem much smaller than before.  I wasn't full after eating a sandwich, salad, and some of my son's mac & cheese.

The mac & cheese was very bland, and their smoked meat poutine isn't anything near what we had from their food truck a while back.

Fortunately, our friends & the kids were happy! Very disappointing, I think that was our last visit to the Yorkville location."}
{"text":"They put more effort into marketing and merchandising than into their food. It's expensive and mediocre.

The Honest Lawyer sandwich (turkey, $13 pre-tax) was so dry and insipid, not even the cranberry sauce could aid it. The bbq beef brisket ($12) was not great either; the acidity was unbalanced and the meat was too soggy, which made the bun soggy.

The only sandwich that was passable was the reubenesque, but for $13 I could get a much better and bigger sandwich elsewhere. The latkes were oozing grease and way too salty.

Needless to say, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to Caplansky's regularly for a few years now. We love it! the environment is causal and friendly the service is always great. The food is what you would expect from a deli."}
{"text":"I would desperately love to give this deli five stars. The owner is a true mensch. I love his politics and his community spirit. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best. Feh! Of course, Toronto delis like its bagels all leave a lot to be desired. The best is Centre Street deli which is unfortunately too far north to get to on more than the rare occasion. There's a new restaurant on Dundas west called Essen that has excellent Ashkenazi Jewish food on the menu. And while not a deli per se, it's far better than Caplanskys' fare for those who want a meal like bubbe used to make."}
{"text":"L'√©tablissement est connu pour ses sandwichs et ses burgers. L'atmosph√®re fait typiquement diner nord am√©ricain des ann√©es 50.

Order the Matzo ball soup and the Montreal smoked meat sandwich. 

Trust me, ok?

{"text":"Went to this place after doing some humanitarian work with some friends on an icy sunday evening.

I ordered the corned beef sandwich and also got to try the smoked meet along with the beef periogies, lakse side dish and their famous doughnuts.

corned beef sandwich was good. The meet was juicy and there were ample amounts of fatty bits within the meat which made the sandwich savoury to devour. The rye was good but I've had fresher. Also came with an order of fries. They were shoestring fries and were very dry and tasteless.

smoked meet sandwich - friend ordered the medium fat meat and I would say that I'd prefer the corned beef sandwich over this one. This was dry and the cuts of meat were far too thick. Had to add a lot of dijon mustard to generate some taste.

Lakse - was quite good, it's like a fried mashed potato and when you order the side, you actually get 4 sizeable pieces enough to fill 2 people as a side dish

Perogies - they were the beef and bacon perogies smothered with onions. Overall, it was good but the crust was a bit chewy, as I had expected them to have a bit more of a pop. It was good but I've had better. You could taste the beef but I don't think I could taste the bacon (? unless I got the menu item mixed up, since it was just a friend's that I took a bite out of)

Doughnuts - had a piece and first impression was that it tasted like a deep fried version of a tiny tom's doughnut. It was moist but had this other hardness that wasn't the crust to it. It was kind of odd.

Overall, would come back, but would probably not try the same items again. Deli sandwiches and nothing that jumps out at you."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the new Yorkville location, but it hasn't got its own Yelp page yet. The food was so great. I tried the BBQ brisket, the smoked meat, and the pork and cabbage borscht (which, alone, was delicious enough return for). Everything was so good and the mustard and pickle bars were genius. The service was also incredible. Loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"FINALLY a smoked meat slayer in Toronto! I have been searching and searching for a venue (other than Schwartz) that could dish up a proper smoked meat sandwich and I always came up short, until I ventured into Caplansky's. 

The \"fatty\" smoked meat sandwich was unbelievable, with every bite I fell more and more in love with it, and with every bite it further reinforced the comforting notion in my head that I finally found a smoked meat sandwich in Toronto worthy of the Gold medal. 

Caplansky's brisket is smoked using a 50/50 combination of mesquite and hickory wood. This really enhances the flavour to a point where I don't think it could get any better. The rub is different from that of Schwartz's but is equally as powerful. I highly recommend spreading a streak of horseradish mustard inside to send the sandwich to the next level, and you best believe they rep Anton Kozlik's mustards, St. Lawrence what up.

I've eaten at Pancer's, Kat'z, Centre Street Deli and a handful of other deli's in the GTA, outside of MTL nothing has been as equally satisfying like the Cap's smoked meat sandwich. Truthfully I'm in awe by the quality of smoked meat this establishment kicks out. I can't wait to get back to have the smoked meat sandwich again, as well as the smoked meat poutine and the smoked meat hash.

In closing, what truly sealed the deal for me with this solid 5* rating was the service. From the moment I pulled across the hanging drape and entered the delicatessen I was greeted with a smiling and energetic hostess. She sat me at the bar and from there I chatted with the bartender Peter about their process of smoking the meats and we both expressed are love for Anton's mustards. It is so so so important to offer customers exceptional service and Cap's is on the ball."}
{"text":"I am in Toronto on vacation and a found this restaurant just from walking around and boy did I luck out. I was craving some deli and this definitely satisfied my craving. The Reuben was awesome and the french fries were out of this world. Another cool feature is the all-you-can eat pickle bar and a high tech mustard station. Although the food was great, the service and atmosphere were even better. It seemed like the workers knew all of the customers by first name and they continued to ask us if we we needed anything else. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were here trying to kill some time before the flight (terminal 3). 

Got their leaning tower. Man, it's A LOT of food for a plate! Once we finished, our server gave us a cheer for finishing our food! She was super friendly and nice. 

You also get a giant pot of hot water with your tea. Personal fave, as someone who loves to drink a lot of tea."}
{"text":"I really want to say I like it, but can't. I asked for smoked Turkey and I have never tasted anything so terrible. I do not see the quality. Who eats this food?"}
{"text":"DREADFUL! Over priced dirty place that does not compare to the real famous deli's! 
Nothing more needs to be said. Notice the contrast between good reviews and bad reviews. It seems like you either like or hate this place. That's not the case at all. Because the owner is a bit of a \"local celebrity\" the positive reviews are stacked and the negative reviews are real. Read my previous review for more detail an tell me if you agree."}
{"text":"I feel the need to write an update because yesterday I had a less than flattering experience at Caplanskys. We arrived and were asked to wait approx 10 minutes which would not have been a big deal had there not been 2 available tables (which they eventually seated us at). Then we ordered coffee which unfortunately took approx 15 minutes to get the cream for the coffee, therefore resulting in cold coffee (with no offers of warming it up or bringing a new one). When our meals finally arrived, there were no utensils or napkins and no one in sight to even ask to receive some.

I still really enjoy this restaurant, I was just disappointed at their lack of being able to handle large crowds. It's a popular (rightfully so) restaurant and with popularity comes the need to have people who can handle the pressure. I'm not sure our waitress was up for the challenge."}
{"text":"That tongue!
Great for the whole fam. 
Average service. 
Amazing tongue!
Must check out whenever you're close. Not much of a wait ever (for Toronto norms). 
I think I could eat that tongue all day, everyday!
Tongue!"}
{"text":"I tried their smoked meat sandwich from their food truck when they were at the Canada Day Celebration at Mel Lastman Square yesterday. The meat was dry, so that was dissapointing.  My guess is that it would be better to eat their food in the actual restaurant than from a food truck."}
{"text":"Do you like smoked meats? Are you going to be in Toronto? Then make your way to College Street for this place.

I had the smoked Salami sandwich and it was delicious. There was no need to add Mustard, which you commonly have to do at other Jewish Delis. 

I also split the potuine and this was a mix of french fries in ground beef, think of it like eating sloppy joe's with fries and cheese in it.

The service was very good. Our server Lauren was very nice and attentive, though we were there 3 PM on a Monday afternoon.

All in all, I definitely will return and if you do, try any of the smoked meat sandwiches and split the poutine with someone. The portion is insanely huge for one person."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded to 4 because of the excellent beer options for a deli.

Happy to report I was finally able to satisfy my 4-5 month smoke meat craving. Let's get straight to the big question - is it as good as Montreal smoke meat? The best smoke meat ever (Sorry JK). The answer is no... but this is easily the best smoke meat in Toronto.

The restaurant is a good size with lot's of seating. I arrived during the lunch hour but only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Our waitress was so friendly and welcoming. She checked in on us multiple times to ensure we were OK. 

When I checked in on Yelp - I got a free order of fries... Bonus.

I started with the matzo ball soup served with a single slice of rye bread. This was one of the better matzo ball soups I had in a while. One large Matzo ball included.

The fries are really good but be warned, the portion is huge. Three of us shared one order.

The smoke meat sandwich was very good. The portion size is smaller relative to Montreal but still filling. They have some homemade mustard options available ranging from light to super spicy. Give them a try, they give some kick to your sandwich. I went with a medium sandwich but you can get fat or lean. I have never been a fan of the more fat style, I like my smoke meat on the lean side. 

I love dill pickles and like most traditional deli's, the pickles are so good. I ordered a side of pickles. 

One thing I disliked was the cole slaw - a sharp vinegar taste. 

The beer menu was fantastic - I didn't see that coming at all. Lot's of craft selections on tap or in a bottle. I enjoyed a Beau's Lugtred with my sandwich. 

It's not Montreal good, but damn good...

BK"}
{"text":"I love Caplansky's smoked meat sandwiches! I don't get anything else whenever I come. I would like to try but I always go back to it. The basket of fries are super crispy and not to be missed either.

We ordered the deep fried pickles once, they were probably the worst DFP we've ever had in the city. The batter didn't stick and was just unappetizing. 

The Matzo ball soup was beyond bland. 

This is probably why I stick to what I like."}
{"text":"In my current phase of trying to find the best Montreal style smoked meat in Toronto, I decided to give Caplansky's a try. After reading several reviews, i wasn't sure what to expect.

The deli itself had a casual feel and was cleaner than many places around Toronto. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and asked if we were eating in or ordering take out.  I did order to go but did end up eating there.  while waiting we enjoyed the background music which reminded me of old school french music from the time of Edith Piaf.

It only took about 5 mins or so to get my smoked meat sandwich and side pickle wedge.  I would have to say that the sandwich is pretty pricey for the portion size.  My partner and I did not agree over the quality.  I found the sandwich pretty average whereas she enjoyed it more than the sandwiches we had at schwartz's in Montreal.  In her opinion, although the meat was not as seasoned, it seemed like it was smoked longer and the flavour was stronger.  Her only issue, the meat was overheated and dry.

The one thing I know for sure I'll be back to try is their beef bacon."}
{"text":"Definitely not as good the one on college but definitely the best food at the airport. Price is right and it's quality deli meats.. Quick service for food food before a long flight .. U can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"I'll give you two stars because this is a first of the many times that I ordered from here for lunch. I suppose they figured that putting meat that looked like it was stuck in the back of the freezer for a week or two was acceptable to put on a sandwich because I ordered from the Ritual app and wasn't there to actually watch fresh meat being sliced. Nasty. I couldn't take the half eaten sandwich back because I had a meeting to attend and was absolutely starving considering I finally got out to pick up a quick lunch at 2pm, which was my first meal of the day! I had to slather that leathery meat in mustard. You should be ashamed to serve somebody a sandwich like that for that amount of money. And stop burning your flecking potato pancakes. #whenbusinessesdodumbsh**."}
{"text":"I love this place! My first smoked meat sandwich was amazing. I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in the GTA. If others tell you otherwise they don't know what they are talking about. No longer need to go to Montreal. If you don't like smoked meat then all the deli favorites are available and even some unique choices. Great environment too."}
{"text":"Together with Corned Beef House, the best smoked meat in Toronto.  But Caplansky's has more of a deli feel.

The service is also reminiscent of an old-style deli in that its friendly and familiar whether they know you or not..

Great place."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my Caplansky's meal last night. I ordered delivery via Hurrier and when my food arrived, while it was still warm, it was dripping in oil and so smelled badly I could not eat it.  Really poor quality.

Ordered: Knish - gravy tasked awful and knish was so oily
Perogies - swimming in oil and perogies were like rubber
Deep fried pickles - these were ok, I was able to eat some. Nice sour pickles.

I spent $30.00 on dinner and could only eat 10% of it.  I won't be ordering from Caplansky's again.  I wish it was good like Katz' deli in NYC."}
{"text":"I like Caplansky's. After a long exile on the east coast, I realized that one of things I missed the most was good deli. Luckily I moved into Kensington market just when Capalansky's moved to their current location. I still remember when they were having the teething troubles with their smoked meat right at the beginning.  I  made sure to take my Bubi and Zaidi when they visited and they made a poached egg for my Bubi,even though its not on the menu.  Just for that they get an extra star. 
 
  Here is the rub, I still find some of the food, even the Smoke Meat, hit and miss. I came in last week for a Deli Platter with an extra side of fries and pickles. The Deli Platter was okay, especially the Tongue and the Salami but the Smoked Meat was a little lean (I'll maybe ask for it fatty next time) and the chicken was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Big disappointment! Came from Waterloo  New Year's Day and I can't believe this place is often to compared to Schwartz in Montreal: not even close!  Bread was on the stale side, smoked meat was tough (despite ordering medium fat) poorly cut and lacking that true smokey flavour and no crunch to the Dill pickle. At $10.00 for sandwich & pickle, I can get equivalent here in Waterloo (Mel's Diner)without the 2-hour drive to and from. Won't be back, EVER."}
{"text":"http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10347210

enough said.  but you can tell it's not a cleanly place, even despite this.  food was okay, i liked my smoked meat poutine a lot but everything else seemed dry and underinspired."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best deli in Toronto. The amount of meat you get on the sandwich is a great deal for the price. The service is very friendly and the poutine was delicious. Mention the mustard choices are fab. Mild and delicious is heavenly!!"}
{"text":"We learned about this place while watching the Dei Man documentary and added it as a must-eat to our Toronto list. The smoked meat sandwich did not disappoint! Seriously the most flavorful sandwich I've had from a Jewish deli. And I love that it's a legit Jewish deli, fully embracing the culture, rather than being \"Jewish-style.\" Latkes are also good but matzah ball soup was a bit bland. But that meat ... oh man ..."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and wish I could go there more. Great service and awesome food. The meat loaf sandwich was the best sandwich I've had in Toronto. The fries are outstanding too.

Very close to Kensington Market, but I would recommend that you eat and Caplansky's and then go to Kensington after to grab dessert."}
{"text":"To my surprise, the Reubenesque came in very much like a panini and it came in a lot less meat than I expected from a reuben that I had in mind. Well, much less sauerkraut too.
It tasted good, but not good enough.
The soup I got was a cabbage borscht and it's very much like the ones that I would found in some restaurants in Hong Kong. It's great, I liked that.
The fries came in and I was busy with the soup and sandwich, so it sat there for a little bit. It's my fault, when I eat them, they were cold and not crispy, rather crunchy. And because they are thin, there are no \"meat\" inside...

I have to come back another day and pick something else, no way it's like this."}
{"text":"Caplansky's has an excellent NY deli vibe, great smoked meat, and a pretty extensive menu of other great items. The service can be a little slow during busy times, but never painfully so. 

I'd recommend the smoked meat, or else you could go with the daily special. Either choice is sure to be more than satisfying for even the most discerning deli fans."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Jewish deli, look no further. I got the smoked meat sandwich because it's famous and I couldn't help myself. I loved the bread it came on, and the smoked meat was pretty delicious. The sandwich was just hard to eat without everything falling out onto the plate. 

I also tried the mac and cheese with the smoked mean in it, and that's the way to go!

We had the nicest server. She was super funny and knew her stuff."}
{"text":"A great spot for old-school deli treats like Montreal Smoked Meat or pickled tongue sandwiches on rye, potato salad, latkes, kreplach and knish.

As well they have a great selection of mustards to go with all the sandwiches. My personal favorite is the horseradish-mustard.

This place also does great diner-style breakfasts. 

PS: If you like Caesars, Caplansky's adds an extra treat to the drink - a big, dill pickle spear! A nice change from the sad stalk of celery often plunked into them in many establishments."}
{"text":"Being from Montreal, I crave a proper smoked meat. New York can deliver but Toronto has always disappointed. I had high hopes for Caplansky's. The sandwich was OK. I found the meat dry despite having ordered medium (as in medium-fat, not cooking). It was also a bit smokier than many of the other smoked meats I've had. I love smoked brisket, but I'm not sure if I like a more intense smokiness in smoked meat (quite different from BBQ).

I'll probably go back and give it another shot, but my hopes and expectations are much lower now."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  Ate out on their patio.  Food was amazing.  And, they had a stopgap.ca ramp!  Thumbs-up Caplansky's!"}
{"text":"Just like the sign outside says: great food, bad service.

I want to point out that the problem is not the servers, at least not ours, as she was both attentive and apologetic for our wait.

Rather, the problem seems to be with the guys in the kitchen. The restaurant was not particularly crowded and yet it was a very, very long wait for our sandwiches (40 minutes)."}
{"text":"Stopped by their Front Street Foods pop-up and tried the BBQ beef brisket on a bun and a [something] hot pocket. I don't remember what exactly the hot pocket was called.

The beef brisket was so good. Juicy and flavourful. I think there were dusted onions; whatever it was, it added a nice crunch to each bite. 

The hot pocket was filled with unknown cheese and meat. I'm not sure what it was and it smelled kinda funky. I also came with a watery dip that was also like a concoction of mystery stuff. None of it was bad, but it did not stand out and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had the smoked meat sandwich. With the fasser option (more meat).  Was tasty and the bread was spot on.  Hate when the bread is lame.

I thoroughly enjoyed the mustard tap!

Stop in for the meat
Stay for the mustard
Leave because your full!

Thanks"}
{"text":"Went to Caplansky's with two girlfriends on a casual Sunday night.  We scored a seat out on the patio, which is pretty large.  I've been before with other friends and it was tasty.  Had the smoked meat sandwich combo last night and got latkes as well as a small coleslaw.  The plate of latkes that came out was huge - brought some home.  THey came with sour cream as well as apple sauce on the side.  Had to add salt but that might just be me.  My sandwich was really good, got medium cut of smoked meat.  There are a whole slew of mustard options for your sandwich.  I put the horseradish mustard on mine and I liked that they have a hot mustard option.  You get a pickle on the side of your sandwich and it was great, perfectly sour and enough bite.  After entrees, my sweet tooth had me order the carrot cake with cream cheese icing to spilt with my girl friends.  The cake itself was decent, but the icing was a letdown.  It wasn't a thick, creamy, rich cream cheese icing that should be on carrot cake.  It was thin and kinda cold, with a slight cream cheese flavour and a bit of a fondant feel.  I think their carrot cake icing needs an overhaul.  After that disappointment, my friend wanted to order the lemon tart which we should have just ordered in the first place.  It was citrusy and refreshing, nice dessert for a patio.  And while on the subject of patio, whoever made up their music playlist did an awesome job - Neko Case, the Smiths, Beck to name a few... they get an A+ for not your typical bland patio music.  They also enforce a no smoking rule on their patio, which one patron found out almost right after lighting up.  I thought that that rule was a nice touch , but maybe if I was a smoker I'd feel differently.  Overall, a nice casual place for breakfast, lunch or dinner that leaves you satisfied."}
{"text":"Given that there are already 70 reviews of Caplansky's, I'm not sure how much value my comments will be able to provide to others. Once you exceed 10 or 20 reviews, your comments sort of get lost in the mix. That being said, I'll do my best to provide objective comments about eating at Caplanskys.

Disclosure: I had a 'spend $15 get $30' coupon from Living Social. Without this coupon, I likely would not have come to Caplansky's for lunch. This was my 3rd visit, so I knew exactly what to expect.

Consistent with a lot of other reviewers, are my feelings regarding their pricing. Going there for lunch, after tax and tip, it is difficult to leave with a bill under $15.

I chose the smoked bbq beef brisket on a bun (my fav on the lunch menu) (cost $8). It is a fair sized portion. Probably at least 500 calories, and could be consumed solely on its own. As I had the coupon, I chose to get the lunch combo ($12) (which included a small Caplansky's salad). The salad is filled with mixed greens, chick peas, cucumbers, tomatoes and sprouts, mixed with a honey mustard vinaigrette.

My colleague went with their mainstay, the smoked meat 'Fresser' combo (which included a basket of fries). I did not have a taste, so I can't comment on the Fresser. That being said, he polished it off, and did not have any complaints.

For dessert, I chose the carrot cake ($4.95), which was moist and had just the right amount of cream cheese icing on top. 

Regarding the service, I am well aware of other people's comments about the service. I am also aware that the restaurant goes by the tag line 'great new menu, same lousy service'. To be honest, I simply did not have any complaints regarding the service. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the restaurant was rather empty (which was a surprise in itself, given that it was 1230pm on a Thursday afternoon). We were seated right away, (there was no line-up) the waitress approached us rather promptly, and answered all of our questions politely. We were in and out in a little more than an hour.

One fair warning, when you leave the restaurant, you will notice a distinct smell of smoked meat on your clothing (which is a big turnoff for me). If given the choice, I'd rather not smell like smoked meat the rest of the day, so if this is an issue for you, you might want to give Caplansky's a pass.

I would say that 4 stars is an appropriate rating given that there were no complaints regarding the food or the service. The only reason that I would not give it a 5 is because of the priciness of the menu, and because of the fact that my clothes smelled upon exiting the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have had Caplansky's meatness a few more times, and feel that perhaps we got off to a wrong start.

First off, the decor does not match the food.  The decor is plain, while the food is rich.  The meat is rich, the desserts are rich.  In fact, I have been to Caplansky's at least twice just for dessert with friends.  Their chocolate cake is great!  Pass on the rugelach though (go to Bagel World instead - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bagel-world-toronto-2).

Their smoked meat burger is amazing.  The meat is moist - and rich in flavour.  Can I get it on a challah bun?!  You betcha!!!  Treat yourself to some bacon on that burger.  You won't regret it!

Even their matzo ball soup is rich and flavourful.

Caplansky's is becoming my comfort food stop.  It doesn't hurt that www.orderit.ca has added it to their line up of restaurants that deliver...."}
{"text":"this is the worst place and i will never go back. the service was horrendous.  hands down the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant ever.  We got seated and were basically ignored until we finally got a waitress to ask for menus.  We had to ask to get our table wiped down and had to ask for utensils as well.  Finally when we ordered, the food took over 40 min to get to us because for some odd reason they didn't even put in my order.  The table next to us left the restaurant when their food came because they waited too long.  legit didnt touch their food at all and left.  Good for them, but I would have eaten it haha.

my friend ordered the smoke meat hash which I can say was pretty good. I had the leaning tower of caplansky, which i had high hopes for because one of my friends told me that it was the best french toast she ever had. DIGUSTING. I am not one to not finish my plate when I go out and i left prob about half of it at the end. 3 slices of bad french toast (a little burned) with cheap gross blueberry sauce on top and a nasty amount of cream cheese that wasn't even good shoved in there.  It looked sloppy and i felt sick even eating half of it. 

also we ordered a side of their beef bacon for $5.  they gave us 2 slices. cool. this place is the WORST."}
{"text":"I ordered a smoked turkey sandwich. Besides the fact that the sandwich was small,the turkey was under-cooked (pink) and tasted awful. There was no sauce on the sandwich either, just turkey, some greens and tomatoes. 

One other thing I noticed at the restaurant was that their prices online (tasteaway) do not reflect the in-store prices. The sandwich was $10 online and $8.50 in store.

Will not order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I'm sure you can find better delis at better prices in the city, but as someone from outside Toronto, from a country who doesn't have good delis, it was all good. And it was the precious last chance to get Montreal smoked meats and poutine before leaving Canada."}
{"text":"Some hardcore, Caplansky love coming your way.  I have 3 excellent experiences....actually 4.  I came for brunch in the last year and had the smoked meat hash, eggs sunny side up and rye toast.  Delicious!  Then, we were at the airport?  A CAPLANKSY'S (note: this location is nowhere near Pearson).  We split a smoked meat sandwich with hot mustard.  Heavenly!  Last night, I went back for my old standby: smoked meat hash and ate half my boyfriend's sandwich.  Wonderful!  The meat was so tender and sliced ever so perfectly. 

In addition to these generally great experiences I also used their catering service for a work event and they were beyond professional.  The food they delivered was great and prepped right there during the event.  They were a dream to work with.

Thank you Zane and team for being awesome day-in and day-out!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is overrated.  Apparently it used to be great when it opened, but the meat is dry dry dry.  Soggy bread, dry meat, and not much flavour.  Definitely not worth a repeat.  Any of the jewish deli's up north like Steeles deli or Centre Street FAR surpass.

Also, some of the most flavourless fried chicken I've ever tried.  Not greasy, but literally didn't taste like anything.  Worse than KFC."}
{"text":"Morning flight boarding time 8:30.  Entrance says seat yourself except all the tables aren't cleared so you make your own space.

It's an airport so we assume getting our order in by 7:30 should give us plenty of time.  Flagged down the server to get in our order.  Short staffed or disorganized I can't tell which as some are running around like chickens with their heads cut off and others are moving like they're taking a leisurely stroll through a park.

It took 40 minutes to cook eggs, latkes, and toast.  FORTY MINUTES.  Food was fine when it finally arrived.  Had to ask for cutlery.  

Food is a 3.5 and service is 1."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced half-decent food, but can't expect much from Pearson.  We got the all-day breakfast for $12, which was just two eggs, toast, potatoes and beef bacon (interesting, but I prefer pork bacon).  Definitely not worth the $12; I could've gotten a similar better-tasting breakfast for half the price.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Just came back from New York where I had both Katz's and Carnegie Deli pastrami.  Both of them were far more flavorful than Caplansky's  IMHO.  Matzoh ball soup was okay although I found the broth a bit bland.  Rye bread was a bit doughier than I like BUT the service was great!  They split the sandwich combo for us without complaint."}
{"text":"2nd time back and this place was the epitome of bad.  It took FOREVER (40+ min) for our food to arrive and when it did it was very sad looking.

My \"steak\" and eggs came with 1 broken egg oozing across the entire plate, the piece of meat paper thin and completely overcooked.  The thing tasted of cardboard with Tex Mex spice coating.

Looking around the restaurant you get the feeling you're in Disneyland or Universal Studios.  It's packed wall to wall with merchandising, twitter posters, \"buy Caplansky dollars!\" and other paraphernalia... so I guess it's okay that their food is so dismal - it's no longer their primary focus."}
{"text":"For a couple of years now I've heard of Caplansky's and their smoked meat sandwich. I was also told it wasn't quite like the Montreal version which I love so much but I found myself in the area and decided to give it a try.

All in all it was good and I feel it deserves another chance but it wasn't the fantastic sandwich that I was led to believe. Don't misunderstand, it was good, it just wasn't transcendent.

The meat was hand sliced which is important when dealing with brisket. This is something that can't be sliced by a machine, something that Druxy's never understood. The bread was a nice soft rye from Silverstein's and they had spicy mustard on the table. I ordered a combo with a pickle, slaw and fries. 

The sandwich arrives and it looks good. I put on the mustard and the first bite wasn't what I was expecting. The meat had a salty, briney taste to it and I could only taste a hint of the smoke. By the time I had gotten to the second half of the sandwich I could taste the spices and it was a lot more pleasant.

The fries are nice. They're shoestring cut and crispy. You get a basket of them and it's hard to stop eating once you start. 

The price was a little more than I would have liked. At $13.00 it's a little pricey so next time I'm just going to get the sandwich and see if it fares any better than the first time."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 for the lunch we had here today but the staff really do try, and the place is kept clean and the condiments counters kept well stocked. We usually go to the location on College just above Kensington but were in Yorkville today so we went here. We ordered the bagel with lox \"and a schmear\" of cream cheese, a smoked meat poutine, and the must-have deep fried pickles whenever you're anyplace that actually serves them. Do keep in mind that Caplansky's fried pickles are a signature item made with kosher dills and a batter that is more like corn dog coating than breading, and has an interestingly spicy heat to them (cayenne seasoning perhaps?).
Unfortunately, the pickles and the fries were soggy and too greasy. The poutine was also not very hot, with some of the curds distinctly not melted. The smoked meat topping is a very homey tasting \"sauce\" of little meat bits, also just warm rather than hot. I was expecting the order to be a little bigger but it really is just a little side dish, like one for cole slaw. The bagel for the lox and cream cheese was also rather small, and fell apart as soon as my daughter tried to eat it. Much heavier on the cream cheese than the lox. They don't have the platter option like they do on College above Kensington.
The service staff was very sympathetic to my feedback when they came to check up on us and asked if there was anything they could bring, but, having mentioned the condition of the pickles and fries and my suspicion that the oil wasn't hot enough for cooking, he returned with a confirmation that there seemed to be an issue with the fryers.
He seemed genuinely eager to make us happy with our meal, and returned with a discount voucher and the hope that we'd return. I wouldn't hesitate to take him up on it and see if things are better next time I might be in the area."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is amazing and you can smell it all over the place. 

I consider it a little bit expensive compared to other delicatessens."}
{"text":"We rolled in for lunch on a Sunday hoping for smoked meat, but they didn't have any ready.  There were a few things on the menu where they have smoked meat in them, but it must be yesterday's since those were available to order (smoked meat hash, smoked meat and eggs, etc.).  I think they had offloaded all fresh meat to their food truck, which was ferociously packing up buckets of meat and left while we were there; meanwhile their actual customers who went out of their way to go there for the same thing were left without it.

From afar another customer had the BBQ brisket sandwich and it looked decent, so I ordered that.   It came and was half cold, half warm, and soaked in a bbq sauce that tasted more like spaghetti sauce than any BBQ sauce I've ever consumed.  It was edible enough to eat 1/3 of but that's about it.

My SO had the smoked meat and eggs, nothing special.

The fries were the only thing on our table that could be construed as good.

I see absolutely no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I have had Caplansky's on my bookmarks list for what seems years.  Either way this location on College is the \"OG\" since they now have the truck, one at each terminal at Pearson as well as the new Yorkville place.  To me, there's nothing like the original because it was what has inspired the growth of the business and normally is the baseline because it's the one that started it all.

I've been to Centre Street in Thornhill and this place is different.  I'm still yet to go to Wolfies as well.  It was one of my Yelpie BFF's birthdays (Monica F) and she had selected Caplansky's as the location for our Sunday brunch.  Being that we were to meet at 130pm it felt like 230 because Daylight savings had just kicked in the morning of and surprisingly the place while busy wasn't 100% packed or a line of patrons waiting.  Mind you it was nice enough outside that people were eating outdoors on the patio as well.  Not bad weather for a November eh?

We had the round table by the glass door facing east and it was nice, bright and sunny inside.  The decor reminds of me a old deli and it's almost nostalgic to see.  I've never been to Caplansky's before, ever so I didn't know what to expect.  It really has a nice feel to the place inside.  While I'm talking delis it's almost impossible to compare it to the kind of places I've been to before like Carnegie and Katz's in NYC and Schwartz's in Montreal.  This place is much more relaxed and casual while the others simply seem more \"tense\" not necessarily because the others are busy but I don't feel rushed at Caplansky's where as Katz's is a loud chaos where you are basically treated as a number, not a person.

Sitting at the table you simply cannot help but notice that there's 5 different types of self serve squeezable mustards for you to try.  Choices right?  Just like the menu itself... decisions, decisions...

Caplansky's offers a very nice menu selection including all day breakfasts, a variety of sandwiches and meats as well as other things like soups, salads and a nice variety of \"small\" plate type dishes like poutine, knish and latkes and you can finish it all off with some dessert as well.  A full bar you say?  Being brunch and all they had 5 dollar specials for both mimosas and bloody caesars (I have to say bloody so Americans reading this don't think I'm talking about a salad).  

My wife had ordered a side of potato latkes and the mac and cheese with smoked meat.  I had gone with the Fat Sam's Grand Slam and a side of fried pickles.  The pickles came first as a starter and there were 5 long spears at least 6 inches each or longer.  They were beer battered and I thought they were good but I think I prefer breaded battered over beer battered as the batter was rather thick.  Still, they were good and they were definitely juicy.  The latkes were basically amazing.  These were the best potato latkes I can say I've had.  They were crispy and well cooked but not greasy and 5 for 5 dollars I felt like I could have eaten 10 on my own easily because they were that good.  They came with a small side of applesauce and sour cream.  

My wife's mac and cheese was very good and very filling.  The added smoked meat is probably a must because it allows to sample their smoked meat and at the same time have a very good mac and cheese.  Just the other evening we had the award winning mac and cheese at Soco and we both agreed we enjoyed Caplansky's mac and cheese much more.  It's more of a traditional cheesy and rich mac and cheese while also being of a good size, this is not a side dish but rather a meal size.  We all had a nice chunk of it because my wife couldn't finish it and the serving is rather generous.

My sandwich (Sam's Grand Slam) while good with a mix of all meats it seems (tongue, turkey, smoked meat, corned beef) it just seemed smaller than what I was expecting.  It was good and it was filling but for 18 dollars I would have expected a much thicker offering.  The meat of course was all good and high quality cuts.  The turkey is especially nice being a nice cut of white breast.  Next time I will probably go with a corned beef or smoked meat \"fresser\" (double the meat for 6 dollars).  

Caplansky's is the type of place that makes me want to try everything and because it's not possible to do that on a single visit, it's the kind of place you just have to come back to again and again and that's the thing, I have no problem with that at all.  Latke poutine, blintzes, knish pocket, matzoh ball soup...?  How many visits is it going to take to check this menu off anyway?

The ambiance is classic while the service is above just friendly.  The food so far is what I would expect from a \"famous\" delicatessen and that makes this place special and keeps me wanting to come back for more.  Caplansky's has a name to live up to and an expectation to fulfill and they do both."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Schwart'z in Montreal. Caplansky's has more room inside and has a very nice patio. Definitely an enjoyable place to eat their famous smoked meat sandwiches. Classic!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I ate at Caplansky's a lot. Quite often. Okay well, once a week and at times that was upped to twice a week. Seriously, I was just happy I could obtain a great smoked meat sandwich in the downtown core! The frequency of my visits lessened as I realized I was packing on a few but when a craving hits for smoked meat, I know where to go. 

So when fellow yelper Christine pm'd about the prospect of checking out the new location of Caplansky's, hey I was willing in spirit and flesh!  We arrived there in the middle of pure chaos, the place was filling up quickly and it seemed a lot the wait staff was still getting used to the optics of serving let alone the experience of riding a rush through. In the weeds as they say or juiced. Fortunately, while there was several pauses in between ordering and receiving, none of the staff were rude and were in fact-apologetic about the state of things. I hope they get their kinks worked out soon but in the meantime, don't come here if you seeking to grab a bite on the go.

Now the new location itself is a beaut-there's the smell of smoke permeating throughout so you can tell they're cooking up something good in the back. Blue and white are the prominent colours and the worn tiled floor and the pressed tin ceiling give it a slightly older look. Zane has created the everyday modern deli, a casual, bright and airy joint where folks of all ages and walks of life can partake in. 

We ordered a virtual grease feast: smoked meat burger, smoked meat sandwich (fatty cut) and the smoked meat poutine. Hey go big or go home! The smoked meat burger was more of a novelty thing but it does need some improvement. For $8 it's on the small side and the meat itself was dry, we thought it needed more fat in the mix but overcooking could have been the culprit as well. Our sandwich was every bit delicious and mouth watering as sandwiches past at Caplansky's however I caution against the fatty cut if you don't like thick ribbons of fat in your meat. Medium seems like the perfect compromise. Again, it's not like Schwartz's nor does it claim to be but judged on it's own merits it's a very fine sandwich. Catching up with the recent poutine craze, Caplansky's offers up a version of its own. The gravy is thick and savoury, a blend of smoked meat chunks and bits of onions. Our main issue was that our order came with too many duds of crisped out dry ends. There are also a few health(ier) options on the new menu, such as salad (yes salad!) and smoked turkey. 

I'll be back many more times, smoked meat can never escape my cravings no matter how much damage each visit here entails in terms of calories!"}
{"text":"First time at Caplansky's and I can't believe it took me so long to try it out! I had an amazing reuben sandwich, I don't think it's a regular item on the menu, just a Thursday special which is a shame because I thought it was fantastic. I was thrilled to order a black cherry Cott which brought me fond memories of Montreal delis! The fries were good not great, but the service was amazing.

If you can't make it to Thornhill to Centre Street Deli this is a great second option!"}
{"text":"Everyone I know comes here expecting great Kosher food. If you're expecting good food in general - don't come here. 
For those on a quest for Kosher food, head to United Bakers Dairy at Lawrence and Bathurst if you're willing to make the trek. Consider it your pilgrimage. 
Caplansky's borscht is an insult to Eastern European culture, and their food a poor representation of Kosher and Jewish cuisine, which a lot of people take the restaurant to represent. As a place which boasts its smoked meats, all they serve are dry undressed morsels of flavourless, unrecognizable animal. 
The last time I went Zane had some insane opera singer preforming. My father, a musician himself found it embarrassing, and laughable. +1 Star for a free unintentional comedy performance, and because you have to put at least one star anyways."}
{"text":"Caplansky's makes an excellent smoke meat sandwich. If that's what you want, you will have trouble finding a better spot."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, but they can be found just as good elsewhere, but I don't get what the big deal is with this place.  The food is way overpriced and it's a boring place full of tourists that don't know any better."}
{"text":"Caplansky's recently opened a new deli in the Yorkville area. Knowing nothing much about Caplansky's Deli besides their Smoke Meat Sandwich from a few of my friends and colleagues, I decided to give it a visit the other day.  



The very first thing that I noticed when I walked in was the friendly staff. They were very welcoming and attentive. As soon as they found out that this was my first time at Caplansky's, they recommended their original Smoke Meat Sandwich. They claimed that this is one of their signature sandwiches, and also their best seller. Hence, I ordered a Smoke Meat Sandwich with fries.

While waiting for my order, a staff showed me their Pickle & Mustard Bar. As a fan of mustard, I naturally fell in LOVE. There were a total of five different kinds of mustards that you can choose from. 

.Classic Ballpark Yellow Mustard
.Russian Honey Mustard
.Mild & Delicious Deli Mustard
.Hot & Horseradishy Deli Mustard
.Super Extra-Hot Deli Mustard



To be honest, I wanted to try all of them but I chose the two that appealed to me the most - Russian Honey Mustard and Hot & Horseradishy Deli Mustard. As soon as I was done choosing my mustards, my food was ready for pick up. Perfect timing =)



It was a BIG sandwich! The meat was probably over an inch thick, sandwiched between two slices of crisp bread. When I took my first bite of the Smoke Meat Sandwich, I was immediately impressed with the tenderness and taste of the smoke meat (my concern about having smoke meat was it being too dry and tough to eat). The meat was sliced thinly and all the juice was dripping at every bite. Their very own spice rub also added a lot of flavours to the meat, but was not overpowering. After finishing half of the sandwich, I decided to move on to the fries because I knew that inhaling the whole sandwich would leave me no room. Their fries were actually one of the best I've had (beside McDonald's of course!). They were thinly chopped, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned. They also had a distinctive taste that I will never forget.

Until next time Blogstees!

Love,
Janet"}
{"text":"I would've given this a five star but the problem was they were a little bit shy on their meat and really they should be making their own Rye bread it also was too small, but let's talk about the soup the soup was to die for ***** five stars for the soups  unbelievable actually maybe the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Rye bread. Smoked meat. Mustard and a pickle. Not very complicated, but it works, and it certainly works well here at Caplansky's. Start with the split-pea soup and you can't go wrong.

The service was prompt and friendly. All in all, a good time."}
{"text":"Order was taken incorrectly today and I missed out on eating together with my group. Once the proper order was delivered, it was implied that I placed the order incorrectly. In top of that, full price on the bill. Wasn't a lot of money, but was the point, of course. Complaining to manager
got me a percentage off. I expressed my displeasure but I really didn't want to start an argument so I paid the bill (including a reasonable tip) and left. Too bad-I always liked the food at this local hangout"}
{"text":"This place is great. The thick, meaty sandwiches, the selection of homemade mustards and the all day breakfasts! Had the Yiddish rancheros last time, delish! The staff are so friendly too, I once got served by a beautiful chocolate-eyed guy called Mike who I haven't seen since. I love you, Mike!"}
{"text":"It's just OK. Not as the hype makes the place to be. 

Personal taste dictates that I won't return. Extremely salty fries and cumin infused meat"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit. The smoked meat is pretty damn good. No place in Toronto tops Schwartzes in Montreal. But Caplansky's comes close enough."}
{"text":"You don't have to be Jewish to like this place. If you're taking this at face value then its a gem. If you're comparing it to the likes of Schwartz's which in my eyes is the best smoked meat on the planet then it comes up short. You get a strong smoke flavor, as if you are inhaling the smoke which isn't the best thing but it ain't terrible"}
{"text":"Are you craving a thick smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz's? Well if you don't want to make the 6 hour drive to Montreal (which is worth it for the meat alone).... Caplansky's Deli is the place for you. 

Get the special, matzo ball soup, smoked meat sandwhich with a side of coleslaw. 
You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I came out with my hair smelling like smoked meat, just be warned!!

It's jewish american comfort food, and  a nice change from pizza, shawma and burritos. The smoked meat is very good and I tried something called a Knish today, also yummy, smoothered in beef sauce and smoked meat. 

Do not miss the maple bacon doughnuts - so not kosher, but so worth it. 

Prices are good (a dinner for 2 at $20 is alright with me!) and the service quick on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I just came back from my Sunday Brunch at Caplansky's, I thought it was so-so just judging from their breakfast. If you like smoked meat, that's a good thing because it's in everything on the menu. Smoked meat sandwiches, smoked meat hash and smoked meat bacon, it's everywhere. That being said, their smoked meat is delicious.

The potato latkes are also tasty especially when dipped in their cinnamon heavy apple sauce. In a word, they're BOMB.

 What I liked best was their homemade honey mustard, that stuff is good on everything. I dipped all of my breakfast in that stuff, it's addictive.

Overall it was an OK experience. Minus the 4 bees that were flying around our food, maybe slightly higher but not by much.
The best thing on the menu shouldn't be off their menu as a condiment. It just wasn't that special."}
{"text":"I first heard of this place through Dragon's den. (Hey don't judge me- it's an entertaining show!) Ever since I saw the owners numerous attempts It's always been in my mind to check this place out. When i saw his mustards for sale in a local grocery store, I decided- this week is the week!

Well yesterday was the day! It was a happenin' little place! They have a take out section and of course dine in. The menu is a good selection and you get to choose how \"fat\" you would like your sandwich. I ordered the classic smoked meat sandwich with \"lean\" meat and latkes on the side. The smoked meat was very tasty. There is an array of Caplansksy's mustards on the table and I only tried the classic ballpark one. The mustard tasted like your normal mustard but the sandwich and the pickle is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Very good smoked meat.
I have been a few times and really liked it.
It is a bit cramped in there though."}
{"text":"Consistency issues .... BIG TIME...

I know every cow is different but how come at Schwartz's in Mtl or Katz's in NY they don't have consistency issues.. You know why??? Because they are a REAL deli.
My first visit the smoked meat medium was perfect.... Tender, Juicy, meaty , melt in my mouth perfection.
Next time with same order meat was chewy and fatty, so we tried again, same thing, so we tried again, same thing,,, finally my eating buddy and I gave them one last chance.,, same thing.. Chewy meat, not tender ,. Not good...
And the sorry excuse for matzo ball soup, I almost cried... The ball was dense , definitely not a floater.. Broth not seasoned... And was that really a homemade chicken broth ? If it was do yourself a favor and leave it on the stove for 2 more hours..

Once again I'm blown away how the typical Toronto palate has no clue what good food is..
In NY or even LA this place wouldn't last for more than a few months.. I guess they do well because they are serving mostly gentile clientele who harsh as it may sound don't truly understand good deli meat.. That being said Celine Dion clearly knows what she's doing in Montreal.

Sorry guys... My deli expectations are way higher than what this place can deliver."}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq pulled pork sammich on what seems to be a flattened everything bagel / bialy?
Exceptional FRIED latkes that glisten with magic upon serving.
Super chill and friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh Gluten free... I had heard so much from my Toronto celiac friends... alas, today was not going to be the day.

The location in Terminal 3 was on my radar since I started planning my vacation, and we had a stop-over! Wandering to our gate, we found the restaurant, and it was open for early breakfast!  Excellent.  

So, we were seated, and given a menu. I wanted to ask about the Gluten Free options... our server was helpful, but needed to check with the manager, who informed us that there was no gluten free.  Eggs and beef bacon was all I could have. :( Sad face. 

Our flight back to YYZ put us back on the other side of customs and security in Terminal 3, so we cleared security again, and thought we'd seek out our gate since we had a lot of time to kill, and then if we couldn't find food close to the gate, come back.  Alas, we found food after a massive trek to the single-digit B gates that are NOWHERE near Caplansky's so we didn't make it back.

Next time Toronto!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Caplanskys smoked meat sandwiches at Yorkdale's new Concept Eats store. It was tasty and devoured it within minutes. But I am afraid it cant beat the Montreal smoked meats.

Would I come back? Heck yes. For Toronto, this is a great option for your smoked meat sandwich cravings.

Meat was tender and tasty. They had 3 or 4 different mustard sauces, ranging from spicy to ballpark mild. Then you get the bonus pickle."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were super excited to finally hit this place up this past Sunday for brunch. Deep sigh. 

Caplansky's offers a dense menu of carb-rich, culturally Jewish favourites. Right down to their bacon, which is, in fact, beef bacon and not pork (read: Kosher). 

My stomach told me to order the \"Leaning Tower of Caplansky\" which is basically a mountain of french toast (challah bread french toast) with layers of cream cheese and jam throughout. And I think there's a fried egg on top or something. Instead, I ordered a cup of Matzah ball soup and an omelet (you get to choose up to two ingredients before an additional charge begins to add up), complete with fresh fruit and latkes with applesauce. 

My Husband ordered the beet borscht and a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. We had our fourteen month old in tow, who slept almost the entire time, on the bench of the booth we were seated at. 

After we placed our order, I sat in anticipation, so excited because Caplansky's makes every \"Top Place to Brunch\" list and I've been dying to go for a long time.

Our soups came. My Husband got the wrong one but as is his nature didn't point it out and just ate the tomato & leek soup he was served. Mine was just...blah. I mean when me, a white-as-they-come Shiksa can make a better Matzah ball soup, I think we have a problem here, no? 

Then when our mains came, I got the completely wrong omelet. Because they were busy it took a number of minutes before I could flag the waitress down to let her know and by then my Husband had eaten most of his sandwich which he advises was delicious. 

To Caplansky's staff's credit, the rectified the situation right away and replaced by omelet with a new one. It also resulted in my being able to enjoy double the number of latkes I had planned to have, which were savoury and delicious, as was their applesauce. The omelet was OK, and overall I just wasn't as thrilled as I had hoped I would be. 

I got a teensy bit starstruck when Zane Caplansky himself came by our table and asked how everything was (pre omelet incident, might I add) and spewed our some unintelligible sentence in response to his enquiry of us. 

I really hoped this would have been better and I'm sad :( 

There are way, way better places to get brunch in this city, though the service here is better than at most."}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to love Caplansky's. Unfortunately, I went in craving Schwartz's. A primal craving for the best smoked meat in the known universe makes it essentially impossible to judge any other smoked meat on its own merits. Sadly, while Caplansky's might do in an emergency, the smoked meat isn't up to snuff. The smell and appearance were promising, and I liked the spice mix a lot, but the texture was off - it seemed almost mushy instead of melting in your mouth like it should.  However, the fries were good, the service was friendly, the beer selection was well-chosen, and the rest of the menu was interesting. I'll be back. It just won't be for smoked meat."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday with a friend, I had their smoked meat and my friend has the turkey sandwich.  Decent size for both, I really liked my smoked meat, has a peppery flavour I like and it's moist which I like.  A nice selection of mustard to put on your sandwich as well.  Worth going for if you like smoke meat.

We arrived before noon before it got really busy.  It seemed to me that service might lag once it got busy.

I didn't give it 5 stars cause the service is efficient but not good enough to warrant 5 stars. And we went when it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"For all of you that are familiar with the deli sandwich market you will know that Caplansky's is quite the popular name in the industry.  Its been around for a long time.  The owner is quite popular and quite often on the food network.  Never had one near me so never went out of my way to try it.  Recently I was travelling from Pearson and right next to our gate was Caplansky's.  Hungry or not i had to try it.  Then again hem am i not hungry lol.  Of course i ordered the smoked meat sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was a bit small for the price but very tasty.  Bread was super fresh, meat was nice and warm, Swiss cheese was melted perfect.  The fries were hand cut, crispy and perfectly salted.  I give it 3 starts for the fact that it was over priced for the portion.  I would not avoid this place though.  When i'm around again you will find me having another smoked sandwich."}
{"text":"Caplansky's has become somewhat of a local legend and I recently got around to giving it a try. I came here for dinner with a friend on a Sunday night after randomly walking by. We walked in and the place was not very busy, we were seated right away. We ended up sharing a few things, the meal went as follows: 

Cold beet borscht: This was a special of the day; I got a small cup to try because it piqued my interest. The soup was neon pink, a colour that I frankly did not think could occur in nature. While the colour was nice and bright I found the soup to be a bit bland, although the fact that it is served cold was refreshing on a summer's night. 

Kishke ($10): This thing was AMAZING! Probably the best dish of the night. Smoky sausage sandwiched between flakey puff pastry, served on a bed of smoked meat gravy. Great texture on the sausage with just a hint of smoky flavour. Seasoning was absolutely perfect, not too salty and tremendously flavourful. The smoked meat gravy was to die for, so smoky and great to sop up with some rye bread.

Caplansky's platter ($26): consisted of smoked meat, beef tongue, smoked turkey breast, beef salami and a scoop of chopped liver. This was a great way to sample all the meats they have on offer. The smoked meat was the best of the bunch, hand cut into thick slices it was so tender and had great smoked flavour, it went especially well with some mustard,  and red onion. Beef tongue and salami were very good as well. The tongue had a great texture, it basically melted in my mouth and it had good beef flavour without being too strong. The salami was thick and beefy, kind of reminded me of bologna but WAY better. The turkey breast was dry and disappointing; I had to lather it with mustard in order to make it easily chewable. I would definitely avoid the turkey in a future visit. As for the chopped liver, there are few things in the world I cannot stomach but liver is one of them. It had a really strong liver taste and wasn't my cup of tea. 

The service on this night was pretty attentive, and the place gets bonus points for serving local craft beer exclusively. My IPA went well with all the smoked meat. The restaurant itself it pretty simple, diner type set up with a small street patio. They serve breakfast as well as a full dinner menu aside from smoked meats (I was eyeing the beef ribs for my next visit). Overall the food here was solid and gets 3.5 stars; I will bump them up to 4 because Zane Caplansky has become somewhat of an advocate for the local food scene."}
{"text":"The epitome of airport price gouging, Caplansky's offers a limited, but interesting menu. I had the smoked meat hash for $14. Four small pieces of toast, two cubes of cantaloupe, four slices of mandarin oranges, two eggs and a salty mishmash of smoked meat and potatoes later, I'm left thirsty and unsatisfied, but not surprised. 

To start off with the good, the eggs (over easy) were cooked perfectly. The toast was also nicely toasted and buttered. The smoked meat hash was very salty, which really took away from its taste - salt isn't supposed to be a flavour! The quantity was adequate. 

The non-alcoholic drinks are very pricey. $5 for water and $4 for soft drinks is what you can expect there. Do yourself a favour and go to the Starbucks to the right of the restaurant if you want to spend that much money on a drink. 

The service was unmemorable. I asked for hot sauce once I got my food and I was given an unopened bottle of Tabasco. The cashier just stood and watched me while I had to tear the plastic wrap off the bottle's lid. 

I much prefer the Molson Pub in Terminal 1, which offers a similar breakfast dish with a lot less salt, crispy potatoes on the side and jam for the toast. The price is also a few dollars cheaper. Unfortunately, there's no way to eat at a different terminal!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say, I'm a HUGE smoked meat fan.  I've been known to drive from Toronto to Montreal, in large part, just to satisfy some cravings for Schwartz's.  Of course, I also love smoked meat's awesome cousins, corned beef and pastrami (I've also been known to drive down to NYC for some Katz's).  So, I've lamented there not being anything even remotely in the ballpark here in good old TO.

To make it worse, we've actually had some flirtatious near-hits with a few places that, for uber-frustrating reasons, have now gone (most notably Reuben S on King a few years back, run by a particularly friendly but inept owner who once claimed to me to have previously worked at Schartz's - it was inconsistently good, and the buggers had their own thoughts about the meaning of published opening hours).

When Caplansky's first opened in the Monarch Tavern on Clinton, I was thrilled (if I recall, I may have literally jumped for joy), because it was great...at first.

Elements of great Smoked Meat:  proper slices (there's an art to this - brisket muscle fibres can be labyrinthine and you want to maximize cuts against the grain without shredding and wasting that precious meat), proper temperature (you want it sliced and served while still hot since we're talking about a lot of fat with the potential to congeal), appropriate fat content (if you don't order at least medium-fatty, you are not a true smoked meat fan), flavour, which is predominantly determined by the spice rub used (personally, nothing i've ever had has matched Schwartz's in Montreal - I strongly recommend picking up their pre-packaged spices), but more than all of these (even more important than flavour!!!) is what I like to call MELTABILITY.  Brisket, in whatever form you prefer it, is only elevated to the divine if it practically melts in your mouth, and the only way to reach the right melt-in-your-mouth is to cure it properly and then steam it properly.

Caplansky's is still the best Smoked Meat in the city, unfortunately, they are no longer consistent with the quality of their smoked meat, sometimes they attain perfection, but too often, the meat is understeamed to the point of being near-dry.

I have had every other item on the menu as well, with the Versht and Tongue being the next best things on their menu.  Unfortunately, a lot of other items are adulterated with their less than stellar \"Smoked Meat Gravy\".

And what's with Zane's vanity?  I really don't understand why he feels it necessary to plant his likeness on everything, from the menus to the website to the food truck.  And correcting people (I've seen him do this multiple times) to refer to this as \"Toronto Smoked Meat\", come on - who cares?...pretentious.  He should worry more about the consistency of his food.

Also, if you want the best experience, always order the fries and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert - they are consistently perfect.

If I were rating from when they first opened it would be a 5-star, but now, 3.5, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Everyone must come to Caplansky's when in Toronto right? Now I can say I've been. My friend had the burger and I opted for a smoked meat sandwich. The name of it leaves me but it had sauerkraut and cheese in it and it was quite delicious. A decent feed though nothing to rave about. Our waitress wasn't the nicest so I can't rave much more."}
{"text":"Loved the food - Montreal smoked meat sandwich was great and so was the knish with smoked meat.  It was a great indulgence.  I also loved the Greek salad, which made me feel better about all the meat I was consuming!  I will definitely return for my next deli fix when I am in town."}
{"text":"Caplansky's just does everything right.

Their beers are beautiful locals like Duggan's #9. Their soups might complicate your relationships with other soups (good borscht, of course, but split pea with smoked meat? Unhand me, you villain!) The versht is swell, the pickle plate is succulent, the smoked meat poutine is a challenge for a table, much less an individual.

But you go to Caplansky's for the deli. Their smoked meat is beautiful. Juicy without being soggy, fatty without being greasy, flavour oozing out of every pore. Served on rye with a pickle and a table full of local and imported mustards (I recommend the locally produced and unspeakably great Kozlik's Market Mustard).

If you want some variety, give their tongue sandwich a try. Don't wrinkle your nose like that, it makes you look funny - try the tongue and then come back here and tell me if I led you astray. If you want fries with your meal, find someone to share 'em - it's a big order but they, too, are tasty."}
{"text":"I found out about this place in off all places, a design magazine. That's right. There was an article about their logo design. Then I saw Now listed them as best deli in TO so I had to try it especially since they were trying to do the real deal smoked meat out of Montreal. Weird spot in mainly a residential area hidden inside a dive-y sports bar. What's a deli doing here? So it doesn't look like a deli or smell like a deli. But it sure tastes like one. Smoked Meat was fantastic. Great flavor and smoke. Tried Poutine for the first time and since it's a deli it's smoked meat Poutine. Fries were thin with the skins still on so it's all natural. Definitely a heart attack on a plate so I'm glad I don't live in Toronto or I'd be dead by the time I'm 45 from eating all this stuff. The big minus is to order drinks you have to do it through the bar, not the deli. So you get two checks as a result and they don't take plastic so you're stuck with cash. Fortunately, they also accept the honor system even though I told them I may not have enough cash to pay for everything (turns out I did....barely) they still were willing to cut me a break. Great, now I'm telling you to all go there broke. Caplansky's has some great food albeit a lousy location. Maybe they need to set up a Smoked Meat truck and Tweet their location all over Toronto. Works for Korean BBQ Tacos here in LA so why not TO?"}
{"text":"Good food, bad service.
The Reuben was tasty but not the same as some New York deli standards. The pickles were great.
The service was very disappointing. We had to wait for a long time for someone to take our orders while five staff sat in the rear of the restaurant socialising. It seemed like none of the staff were happy to be there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the smoked meat sandwich and I tried some of the fried chicken my husband got. It was great as well. I enjoyed it. I love the fried pickles and I enjoy his horseradish mustard. It has a nice flavour that goes with the smoked meat. I am a fan of any sort of poutine but I do find that the smoked meat poutine is a bit much. Having said that I have found it at other places as well. I would say to share it as a side."}
{"text":"WOW. I was very impressed by this place. The woman who greeted us has been working there for 7 years, and is really good at managing all her tables. Great customer service. Everyone says hi to you as you walk by. 

I got the burger, 70% beef 30% smoked meats. I added an egg and cheddar cheese, which made all the difference. Definitely very very oily, but it was phenomenal. What made it really did it for me was the side pickle and a few chips. 

We also got the poutine, which was SO GOOD. the cheese curds were perfectly melted, and the potatoes worked so well with the smoked meats. However, this was so salty after a few bites. I couldn't handle it and needed a break. 

My friend got the BBQ pulled beef. She also added cheddar, and there was a plethora of meat. She really seemed to enjoy the burger. It's what she gets \"every time\". Overall, also enjoyed how the burgers were served on everything bagels. Really gives it a kick! 

If I lived here, I'd be here all the time. Wanted to try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"4/5, here are my notes:

1. Where else are you gonna go for MTL smoked meat?
2. Smoked meat POUNTINE.  Nice!
3. If dining for dinner, go there early to avoid the rush.
4. They work non-Jewish hours.  Also nice!
5. Get the fatty smoked meat for sure.  Delish.
6. Order a cherry cola or root beer to top off an unhealthy meal.  Kind of sucks they don't have the authentic stuff on tap though.
7. Great location, usually lots of street parking in the area or even free parking on the side streets.  Walkable to Chinatown, Kensington, or Little Italy if you want to make a trip out of it.
8. Didn't have dessert but they looked good.
9. Definitely going again but not sure if it is unique/good enough to warrant a 5-star rating.
10. Staff was super nice and helpful, no attitude at all."}
{"text":"It has been well over a year since I ate here.

I stopped in for dinner between work and class.  Service was tops.  And the food was incredibly delicious.  I just feel like it is a bit overpriced.  

I like the idea of \"nice\" delis but would usually prefer something less upscale and expensive when in the mood for a deli.  

Recommended--the food really is great.  But not if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"The patio is a great casual spot when visiting Caplansky's in the summer time.  Our server was delightful.  Service was quite prompt.

The menu has a lot of classics and doesn't try to complicate what they do best.  Ended up choosing the pickled tongue sandwich accompanied with their Pickled Caesar.  Both were great.  

Will need to make another visit for some Montreal smoked meat next time around."}
{"text":"I got home with my much anticipated take-out and eagerly poured my fries onto my plate and, much to my chagrin, they were the worst looking order of fries I have ever seen in my life.  They were black, soggy, basically dripping oil, and on top of that they were barely even warm!  It looked like they just took a bunch of cold fries and threw them back in the oil.  I honestly felt insulted that they would even try to give me this crap!  Anyone could tell you with one look that these fries were inedible.

I would dismiss it as a one-off, but all I ever seem to hear about this place is the disappointing food and service.

To be fair though, my sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"Nothing terrible at Caplansky's, but it didn't knock my socks off either.  I had a Ruben sandwich with matzah ball soup.  The sandwich was a mess to eat because I couldn't bite through the meat. Not sure it's worth a second visit with so many lunch options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ate here two weeks ago with a friend of mine.  We've been here many times before. Mid-way through her sandwich, she found a THUMB TACK in the middle of her beef brisket. Fortunately for her, it didn't pierce through her tongue or scratch up her mouth, as she only noticed it once she had already bitten into the sandwich.  Her sandwich was removed from the bill, however, her 1 drink was still left on it.  For the terrible experience, the staff should have handled this situation much better.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"The appetizers (latkes and onion frites!) did it more for me than the smoked meat sandwich. I should've asked for extra lean smoked meat (didn't know it was an option). It was served on slices of white bread and a huge pickle (which I gave away because I'm not a fan of pickles). 

The dinner plates my friends ordered seemed more amazing (my buddy ordered the Jew-tine, a jewish spin on a poutine) and I would recommend going beyond the simple at this place. 

The waitress was awesome for entertaining one of our more talkative friends. As well she made great recommendations for dessert. Their vanilla ice cream is on another level. You can tell from the texture that it's homemade. Their chocolate cake... oh god. If you don't come for the smoked meat, come for the cake. Super rich, super dark. I'm missin it. 

We also had maple bacon donuts. Each order comes in threes. Sweet cheesus, you must top off your meal with it. These are timbits on 'roids. Bacon 'roids. 

Would definitely come again on cheat day."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years.  
Was disappointed with my visit.  I remember the place being the best in Toronto for deli meat.   
I ordered a smoked meat sandwich, fries and matzo ball soup. 
The soup was a bit bland and needed salt.  
The sandwich was so so.  The smoked meat was slightly chewy and didn't taste much different than grocery store deli meat.  
I think I'll drive to Montreal next time I'm in the mood for a smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"The Monarch Tavern is a place that you can bring in your lunch or dinner from one of the many great local eateries (California Sandwiches, San Francescos, Bitondos etc).  There is now an in  house option.

Caplansky's is in the back of the second floor of the Monarch Tavern.  The menu is very limited, but it makes up for its size in quality.   The owner brines and smokes beef to come up with a truly great smoked meat.  It's not like any deli meat I've had in Toronto, Montreal or New York.  It's a deli meat but much more smoky, yet not overly so.  If you like deli, go to Caplanskys for a sandwich.  His hand cut fries are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Cap is an interesting cat with a love for the deli world.

Order the \"What Zane Eats\" and rest assured you will skip your next meal. This monster has a stack of grilled salami, chopped liver on rye bread. Yeah no kidding pickles on the side.

I like grilling some salami with easy over eggs and avocado when i make brunch at home so i was excited to see cap making a sandwich with it.

This is a guy who takes a lot of pride in his cooking."}
{"text":"I was raised in Los Angeles and have lived in NYC. If there's one thing I know and love, it's a Jewish deli. I'm considering a move up to Toronto, and having a good source for Jewish comfort food is a tick in the Pro column. Caplansky's definitely fits the bill. 

Husband and I came in on a snowy Friday morning. We started with the matzoh ball soup. The broth is fantastic - nice and golden. The matzoh balls are a little denser than I prefer, but still good. They taste homemade, and not like Manischevitz out of the box. That's a plus.

I had the smoked meat sandwich, which was also really great. Though the meat could have been more thinly sliced, it had a good ratio of fattiness to smoked meatiness. I'm usually not a big fan of rye bread (heresy, I know), but I liked the bread at Caplansky's -- it's mild, and not seedy. Liked the fries, too - perfectly crispy, skin on, and just the right amount of kosher salt. Must try the smoked meat poutine next time! 

The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and expedient. If I end up making Toronto my next home, it'll be likely that you'll find me at Caplansky's, shoving yet another smoked meat sandwich in my eager piehole."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! 
Heard of Caplansky's for quite some time and finally took the family there for a birthday dinner.
Loved the fact that there was an item in the menu for everyone, kids and people who don't eat much meat.
The sandwiches were so good , dessert was awesome and the service was excellent too.
I can definitely see myself going there again and again!"}
{"text":"The last time I remember I had smoked meat was in Montreal.  I am happy to say that I have relived my moment again but this time here in my city Toronto.  There's a lot on their menu to choose from so it may take you a while to decide what to go far.  I ended up getting the smoke meat sandwich in regular with a side of poutine.  Both were amazing and there is a large variety of sauces to choose from for the sandwich.  I sat out on the patio and it was comfortable.  I would give it five stars if the sandwich was just a tad bit bigger.  Other than that I would come back again."}
{"text":"Came back here years later after moving to the US. Glad to see it's still great. Some guy doing magic tricks for tables, was hilarious."}
{"text":"Righto, been twice now!  Huzzah for Caplansky's taking the Groupon plunge and finally enticing us to try 'em out in lieu of the many awesome cafes we have nearer to home -- they've earned repeat visits once the last Groupon's used, that's for sure!

So, first time (Monday upon opening a few weeks ago) I would have said 3 stars, with the caveat that it's really a 3.5.  Second time was with my girlfriend, however, on a busy Sunday afternoon for much needed dunch (that's dinner meets lunch, compadre).

Today's experience was awesome, pushing the mythical 5 star level, with exceptional service, delicious food, ridiculously gut-busting portions, and the little things that demonstrate a restaurant's positive character.  I suspect the third visit will push Caplansky's to a 5.

So, some notes thus far:

1)  Smoked meat poutine looks nasty, tastes pretty darn good, and the $8 full portion is a HUGE appetizer for two people or a freaky meal for one.  Worth a try, for certain, though more a curiosity than a destination menu item.  Heather remarked \"DELICIOUS!\", however, so maybe my \"pretty darn good\" doesn't do it justice.

2)  \"What Zane Eats\" is an insane sandwich of grilled Jewish salami, minced liver, and house dijon on rye.  It's $12, which is about twice the price of a regular sandwich, but this thing is just amazing.  It's basically two sandwiches squeezed into one, oozing with delicious juice and mustard and happiness.  Do yourself a big favour and order it.

3)  Their bacon is house made and very, very different than the standard bacon most people are used to.  For one, it's very lean, almost more like a jerky.  Heather didn't like it; I think it's some of the best bacon I've ever had in a restaurant.  Your mileage may vary.

4)  $5 for seven massive, corn-breaded, house made deep friend pickles is criminally cheap.  This app is enough for a table of five but I still ate most of it all by myself.  (I love pickles, but I hate those stodgy deep fried things... these are not stodgy, they are remarkable!)

5)  Every server seems to enjoy where they work and, most importantly, for whom they work.  This is important to me.  If your shop/restaurant/whatever is awesome but you're an asshole, I probably won't come back.  Zane Caplansky is a jovial, offbeat cat, passionate as hell but also friendly and caring.  I get the sense he's the kinda guy who will tell you you're wrong for saying \"hold the mustard\", but he'll do it in a way that's endearing.  And he's right, anyway, the mustard is integral to the sandwich!

Further to Zane and his staff, let me say that in the pair of times I've been there I've come away with probably a dozen little anecdotes that speak to why this guy is good at what he does, why his staff are exceptional, and why he's likely up for a successful restaurant career for was long as he wants one.  

It's far too many to cram into this one review, but suffice to say most good places give you one or two such anecdotes over many visits.  Caplansky's managed a dozen or so in two sittings.  That's amazing.

So hat is off, bib is on, and glass is raised!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Been here a number of times but this was my first time having breakfast. Ordered the smoked meat hash and was amazed by the size of the serving. The mustards here are legendary and honestly one of the main selling points. 

The service is hit or miss. You either get someone who's super attentive or someone who completely forgets about you. Guess it's part of the charm. Also sometimes on weekends you'll see the owner walking around checking in on customers and serving food."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for a date a few weeks ago.

First off, its a nice little joint, there is a nice atmosphere to the place.

The positive:  
The beef bacon is quite exceptional.  It doesn't have the usual taste of beef or other alternate bacons.  It actually tastes like bacon!
The maple bacon donuts were great!  Just the right amount of sweetness and salt, though a little more bacon wouldn't hurt.
The service was great, they were very friendly, the owner Zane was also there checking in on the customers, which was a nice touch.

The negative:
The prices are a tad high for sandwiches.  I had a Knish in smoked meat sauce.  The first few bites were nice, but the more you eat, the more vinegary the taste becomes until it is almost a chore to eat.  My wife had the bbq Brisket sandwich, again the first few bites were quite good, but the the bbq sauce becomes quite overwhelming.  I am a HUGE fan of brisket, its something that isn't to readily available in restaurants here in Canada, so when I get it, I eat it.  My wife couldn't finish her sandwich and left it to me, and I just couldn't finish it.  The sauce was just too much and gave us both raging headaches.  The latkes needed salt, the fries were ok.  Nothing to write home about.

All things being said, they are known for their smoked meat, which we didn't try.  Will give it a shot next time and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Since my first review I've become a regular, every few weeks arriving for brunch of mostly smoked meat hash (highly addictive and I want to order a bucket for myself only), a spicy caesar and coffee.  It's always excellently prepared and served caringly by awesome staff.  Zane is usually there overseeing his empire of deliciousness.  Everything about Caplansky's I love, from the graphic design to the details of the food.  

Caplansky responds really well on Twitter and is a social media fiend using it to improve his business.  He's a really good guy and if something doesn't hold up to standard he wants to know, he recently said as much during the Mesh Toronto conference talking about the future of food and technology."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy this place I really did. I had heard great things about its food and both my girlfriend and I were excited about the meal. It wasn't until we had the food open back home that we saw just how little food there was to have from quite a hint price tag. Sandwiches were beyond small and the meat sparing. The soup, well I guess I thought that when I ordered the bowl amount it would be a little more than half of those generic paper bowls that every other place on the planet fills to the top. On top of that it had a bone in it that my partner choked on in eating! Paying about 18 dollars on food generally leaves someone full and while the food was good it didn't make up for the fact that we just felt nickeled and dimed out of a filling meal. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We arrived to Yorkville branch last Sunday around 7:40. Their website, Facebook and Google says it closes at 9:00. However the person in charge said the kitchen is about to close and that the whole place closes at 8:00. We asked her what is the fastest thing to prepare so we take it to go. But she told us there is not time to prepare any food!

I told her that in this case i will have to write a negative review on social networks, but she didn't seems like somebody who bothers. To be honest, the college street folks are just awesome. Nice and hard working. But the 1 star for the really bad service of  Yorkville branch."}
{"text":"Dropped by on the weekend to this well known Toronto deli for lunch.  Depending on your timing it can be quiet or lined up at the door. 

We had the standard smoke meat on rye with fries.  We chose the 'medium' fat option but I still found the meat to be quite lean. Flavour was good though leaning towards the subtle. Fries were good and generous in portion.  

Nice deli atmosphere, service friendly, establishment clean. Value for money average."}
{"text":"It's gonna be a tough crowd in the smoked meat sandwich world. As the best smoked meat in Toronto, it doesn't quite measure up to the infamous Schwartz's in Montreal, but it's not far off.

The prices are reasonable but for a sandwich and soup combo, it comes in at $11. Not the cheapest option for lunch. Nevertheless, the \"fatty\" smoked meat sandwich is tasty, the bread is soft and they do pile it several layers thick. The split pea soup is adequate, slightly bland. Overall, if you're in the mood for smoked meat, I think this is your best bet in Toronto.

Still, I don't expect to be blown away and why not drive up to Montreal for the weekend and get the real deal. It's always a party when the French get involved. I gotta feelin'.....whooooohooooo"}
{"text":"What is the fuss about? Has anybody been to a real deli?

A small group of 7 had brunch there today. There was a wide variety of orders around the table. Although the restaurant was not very busy, it was hot, stuffy, and the food took a fair bit of time to come to the table.

My eggs sunny side up were a bit crunchy on botton, the latkes over-fried and the bread burned for most people at the table. The bacon cured smoked meat style is an insult to bacon.

I asked for a taste of the smoked meat and got 2 slices and another 2 slices. Being from Montreal I can attest that it is not good. You will get a better experience buying the Lester's packets from Costco. The slice are too thick, the taste a bit light, the meat too salty, and the 'spec' or covering entirely missing. 

The service was so-so and the owner got involved with coffee and the samples. 

For the money...don't go!"}
{"text":"Best Jewish deli in Toronto!
We had 4 different sandwiches plus coleslaw and a plate of herring. I can't even begin to describe the herring - it simply melts in your mouth! Make sure to have it with some rye bread. The coleslaw on the other hand was alright but nothing special. They give you a lot of it at once so ordering just one would be enough for a group of people.
The salami, pastrami, liver were all extremely tasty. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere - very nice place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food and reasonable service then Caplansky's in NOT the place.  20 minute wait to place your order.  10 minutes to get your order.   25 minutes to pay.  

Good thing we came to the airport early.  Otherwise this place would make you late.  

Oh, and the food was mediocre bad.  Worst bland latkas, really fatty beef bacon.  

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I first heard about Caplansky's this past summer when NOW did their '20 Best Sandwiches' feature.  It's no surprise that I hadn't heard of it, because it's cleverly tucked away off of busy College St.  Caplansky's is above the Monarch Tavern, which is across from Bitondo's.  What makes it even weirder is that it's not even the whole 2nd floor of the Monarch, because they still have bar service up there.

The sandwiches themselves are standard deli fare, with lots of quality meat stacked between two thin slices of rye.  It's really good, but I don't see it as miles ahead of the curve, or anything of the sort.  I think what really attracts people to this place is that it's just so hard to get a decent deli sandwich anywhere in the area.  There's definitely no offerings like this on College, and if memory serves Dundas suffers the same way.  If you grew up with a good deli in your neighbourhood, this place, more than anything, serves up nostalgia."}
{"text":"Taste Delicious! Mission all the way downtown to satisfy those cravings."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for months! The husband was dragging me around to computer stores and we walked by Caplansky's! Haven't eaten all day so here's the perfect opportunity.

Ok, so I've been reading about this place since it opened and I know it's popular. They were even busy at 3:30 on Saturday. Not that busy that they should forget my beer, though.

We split a combo for $11 of a bowl of the soup of the day (Tomato) and a smoked meat sandwich. Really? What was the point of the bowl of soup? It was so bland. As the girl at the table next to us pointed out, it was really just blended tomatoes. Boring. But the sandwich? Melt in your mouth moist. I could have kept eating even after my half when I was already full. Wow, Caplansky's, now I get the hype.

So, next time I may not bother with all the other stuff. Well, I do like beer, but bring it when I order it please? Don't make me ask twice. But really, the sandwich is the thing. OH! The pickle was good too!"}
{"text":"The ultimate lunch spot in Yorkville. I've had everything from the smoked meat (top notch) to the salads (when I'm feeling a bit healthier). Great service. Great food. Unlimited pickles! And the coolest mustard machine in the universe. Unbeatable for lunch in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I had the Rubenesque sandwich, and the latkes. Both were extremely heavy and not flavourful. I guess it's known for greasy spoon diner type food; but still, not very satisfying. I wouldn't mind going back and trying something else, otherwise, not so special. For greasy spoon type of diners, my favourite is Square Boy on the Danforth."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time at Caplansky's and I was disappointed with my smoked meat breakfast.  I remembered the smoked beef to be much more tender and fatty then it was today. My eggs had some crunchy shell bits and latkas were definitely burnt.   I kept coming back to Caplansky's trying to recapture my first experience there.  Still no."}
{"text":"Came down for lunch - place was busy but not packed for a Friday (arrived around noon).  Found street parking a block away ($2.25/hour).  Caplansky's is on a corner with indoor seating and outdoor patio.  We opted for indoors since it was a bit cool (15deg).

Ordered the smoked meat sandwich, chicken soup with matzo balls, and knish.

- Smoked meat sandwich was excellent - the meat is truly amazing.  A little fatty of course though you're not coming here for health food.  And oh, AMAZING hot mustard.  Came with a pickle and coleslaw.  Coleslaw kinda meh, but then again I'm a weirdo and like KFC coleslaw..  The meat and the mustard did it for me though.  Score 5/5.

- Knish.  Pastry with mixed meat filling.  Quite good!  I'm not a huge fan of it and the smoked meat gravy was quite salty, but I'd probably give it another shot.  Score 4/5

- Chicken soup w/ matzo ball.  Meh.  Ok I've never had this type of soup before, but found the matzo balls doughy and the soup bland, with just a few little chunks of carrot and celery and a small sprig of dill.  Maybe this is what this soup is supposed to taste like, but I definitely didn't feel compelled to finish it.  Score: 2/5.

Service was so-so.  Friendly servers but it was confusing who was our waitress since two of them kept swinging by, and they both separately asked if we wanted our bills.  Not the greatest coordination. But the food came quickly - and they had no problems providing additional plates for sharing and even gave extra pickle/coleslaw.  That was nice.  Big negative: the Yelp check-in coupon (free fries) was NOT honoured.  Apparently someone else noticed this more than a month ago and they still haven't removed it.  Not sure if this is the resto's fault or Yelp's, but it needs to be fixed.  Score 3/5

Overall I'd probably say 3.5/5, but going to round down since I wasn't really blown away by the experience.  If you want good smoked meat, I'd say it's worth going."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich was good. 

We had it with the cabbage borscht. This was a good combo. I prefer beet borscht but cabbage was not bad.

It was a nice lunch. The waitress was attentative and nice. My water never got to the bottom of the glass. Also, she dropped one of our bread slices and quickly got us another slice of bread. She was very sweet.

Although a little cold, outside was a nice place to eat a lunch."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Caplansky's the smoked meat was so salty as to be almost inedible. This time it was almost tasteless. The fries were good, however.
  What a shame. The resto remains popular but it's running on fumes."}
{"text":"If you want to stop for a quick sandwich, have a lovely brunch, or stay for a delicious dinner, Caplanksy's is the best! 

Their smoked meat is perfect. If you get it as a sandwich, you have the option for lean, medium, or fatty. Personally, medium is better because you get the flavor without it all being fat. There are several mustard and bread options so you can customize however your taste buds want. They also sell the meat packaged up so you can enjoy it at home, or just get a sandwich to go. 

There are many Yiddish dishes, such as knish and latkes (both which I highly recommend). There are also vegetarian options, so no one is left out. 

It may be childish of me, but their macaroni and cheese is my favorite! I always opt to add smoked meat, unless I am getting a sandwich too.  

The desserts are fantastic as well! I am a fan of their chocolate bread pudding. It is rich and decadent, ideal for sharing. They also have pies and lemon squares, all which you can ask for to go! 

If you are in Toronto, you MUST give it a try."}
{"text":"The extra star is for the kind but slow server but otherwise Caplansky's deli should get 1 star. I ordered a medium fat smoked meat sandwich. It was dry and tasteless except for an an odd curry-like flavour (???uh what) It was horrendous. Honestly, they'd be better off serving mass produced Lesters. I am from Montreal and was hoping for a good fix but it's clear that whoever came up with this recipe has either no culinary knowledge or no respect for tradition. I do appreciate their selection of mustards, but after a few bites I switched to plain ol' yellow. Oh and $13.55 (before tip) for a coffee and really small sandwich BLEEEEH. I won't be back unless I could be convinced that it was a very off day."}
{"text":"3.5 stars **

I may not be a connoisseur in deli and smoked meat, but Capalansky's impressed me enough to venture into this area. I do love my meat.

Dishes of delicious meat sandwiches kept passing through, I just had to order one. Along with a smoked meat poutine.

Word of warning: The smoked meat poutine is a HUGE portion for 1 person. It looks like a huge slob of fries, cheese curds, meat and gravy, but tastes great. You're a freak if you can finish this on your own. So share!

There are mild/hot/extra hot mustards and other condiments on each table to compliment your sandwich. Sandwich was delicious, served in rye bread and stacked with a sufficient amount to satisfy your palate with each bite.

Services was knowledgable and friendly. Quick to order and deliver.

Definitely coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The meat was overly salted and chewy. If you want good deli meat venture on up to Centre Street Deli in Thornhill."}
{"text":"I have to say I had high hopes having heard so much about this place.
In unfortunately was expensive and had very small portion , was greasy and the omelette was wafer thin 
 This is a Pearson so granted it probably was never going to be very good but unfortunately I doubt I will try the college street location"}
{"text":"Disappointed again 2nd time at Carplansky for breakfast tried there full breakfast a few months ago the eggs were not cooked to order the bacon was burnt. Today tried to keep it simple bagel and cream cheese what a joke for a Jewish Deli. Never again for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was hugely impressed with Caplansky's Delicatessen.  The atmosphere was out of this world.  Super busy, but not chaotic--lively and fun.  The staff are super efficient when it comes to seating people and the service was absolutely amazing.  The place was *packed* and yet the service was super friendly and attentive.  The food?  It ranged from okay (a bland chicken soup) to the best I've ever had in my life (the smoked meat sandwich).  There's room for improvement.  The scrambled eggs and salmon was ho-hum.  Anyone could easily make the same thing at home (I have).  And the latke was overcooked and hard to cut--a pretty basic mistake.  And yet the place blew me away.  The smoked meat sandwich, as I mentioned, was incredible.  I'm not a fan of Montreal smoked meat--I don't like the flavour.  But as owner Zane Caplansky says: this is *not* Montreal smoked meat.  This is Toronto smoked meat and, in my humble opinion, ten thousand times better than the Montreal version.  I went to Caplansky's for lunch, but was ready to return the same day for dinner.  And the next day.  And, as mentioned, the service was outstanding.  My server was excellent.  Incredibly friendly and efficient.  And I liked that everyone chips in.  Other servers that were working other tables would clear my dishes as they passed by.  I even saw Zane, the owner, delivering glasses of water and wiping down tables.  That alone made me love Caplansky's.  And if that's not enough, like some other Yelp reviewers I got a \"Jew it up\" button at the end of the meal which I proudly wore the rest of the day (even though I'm not Jewish).  All in all, a great experience.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Caplansky is one my husband and my go to place. It is the place we take friends and out of town visitors to. 
We've been very fortunate too that every time we've taken visitors here, Zane Caplansky is the one to serve us (makes us look that much more impressive to our guests )
My husband is from Montreal originally and this is as close to Schwartz's as we can get to. This is nicely hand cut smoked meat! 
Our typical order is medium fat smoked meat sandwiches, with latkes for me and a poutine for my husband, and Cott's black cherry pop! If you are really going all out then get the latke poutine, or try their in house craft beer (which comes with a pickle spear). 
Their poutines are certainly indulgent and a meal on their own, as the gravy is made with chucks of smoked meat. 
Their in house made mustards are all good choices. I prefer to mix the extra hot horseradish and Russian honey mustard for a sweet and spicy combo, while my husband goes classic ballpark. 
After years of going there I always think I'll try their other menu items, but, the comfort of the smoked meat and latkes are what bring my belly joy."}
{"text":"Much like Melissa G below, I also really want to like this place, but it doesn't live up to Shwartz in MTL or Katz's in NYC. With that said though, it's still a good sandwich.

Came here and had the Platter of course. For $26, you get smoke meat, smoke turkey, grilled salami, pickled tongue and chopped liver. It also has some onion and tomato for those who need a bit of veggies.

I'd say the grilled salami is top notch. It was so tasty. And the picked tongue, really surprised how good it was. It kinda like \"fell off the bone\", but no bone. You got your dark and white meat turkey and I guess two kinds of smoked meat too (looked dark and white). I didnt even bother putting it on the rye, which basically had enough for 4 sandwiches. I'd say it's a share for 3 people.

Friends had the LEO, I thought it was some sausage but menu now says salmon. Could salmon taste like sausage?

And to top it off, Maple Bacon Donuts. Three donut balls for $3, this is bacon bits inside the donut ball with maple around it. Tasted really nice and hot. But I'd prefer if the bacon was like something on top.

Overall, they were busy busy, but waitresses were nice and tried hard to come around."}
{"text":"So today my coworkers discovered one of Toronto's most amazing sandwiches... it is a homemade smoked meat sandwich. You must try it. 

Caplansky's offer's awesome sides in addition to the smoked meat sandwich. The fries are some of the best I have had, the gravy is also homemade and reminds me of authentic jamacian jerk gravy (it is homemade from the smoked meat), the split pea soup was delicious, and the cole slaw was refreshing In fact, I found the whole meal rather light and well portioned. Of course we were all in a protein induced food coma for the rest of the afternoon. 

These sandwiches are currently sold from a table on the second floor of the Monarch. But based on how busy they are, my guess is that they'll be finding new (larger) digs soon.

{"text":"Best smoked meat in town? I guess.

Upon hearing the word Caplansky's, for many in Toronto triggers immediate salivation and mental images of their famed carnivorous fares. This College Street fixture is often packed, but the lineups often disappears once the patio opens.

The proprietor Zane Caplansky is often here looking after his home base, staffed with enthusiastic faces, and covered with silly Jewish puns. Zane is often the one greeting you and leading you to your table.

There are plenty of ways to have your Caplansky's smoked meat fix, and the sandwich is the staple of the experience. Damn it's good--chewy and tender and nice hints of smokiness, stacked high on slices of rye bread, served with a pickle slice and a rather mundane cup of coleslaw. Their burgers and poutine are equally delicious.

Each table is stocked with a set of in-house mustard, ranging from mild to spicy. It is fun to try them all.

At one visit, a server recommended I have their maple bacon donuts for desert. The accepted challenge came in the form of three large crispy donut balls--quite like Timbits--that was swimming in syrup and not a lot of fried-to-a-crunch chunks of bacon. Even though I am a junkie for anything maple syrup, this one was... meh.

Overall, it's a great relaxed place to get your lunch deli fix. I only wished they actually served pastrami sandwiches here. Also, the basement level washrooms are quite on the dingy side.

{"text":"Not bad dollar value for where you are. Menu if kid of small in selection, but they cover the bases. I had   the burger. Fries were cold, and burger was not as hot as I thought it should be. 
The beef brisket was not hot, but it was a ok.
Waiter was right on."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars
The FARC's were on the fly this evening along College Street as there was meat to eat and we were a pair of girls up for the task.  (Isn't this beginning to sound like a Ric T. review :)   While everyone was gibbering over the fact that yesterday was the 999 day all I could think of was that today was the day that the Black Hoof was reopening from its summer hiatus and that finally the long, long, long lineups at the new version of Caplansky's might finally be starting to subside.  About 3 p.m. this aft I DM'd my FARC winger Deanna asking her if she'd like to check out Caplansky's and it was a big thumbs up from her.  What can I say, we are just girls who love the meat.  :)  

Caplansky's new dining locale is rockin.  It was busy and there was a real buzz in the air.   Zane Caplan has much to be pleased about because Caplansky's is drawing all generations in to the new location.  From the 8 month old beside us gnawing on the eggs special to the 80 year old on the other side of us reading Tennesee William's \"The Glass Menagerie\", to the hipsters, the students, the suits and TIFF chasers, Caplansky's seems to be the spot that appeals to all generations.  It is bright, blue & white, tiled, noisy, breezy and has a really decent feel good vibe to the place.

With all of that being said, let's talk about the chow.  After all, isn't this why we came here?  We ordered up the smoked meat poutine, a smoked meat burger and a smoked meat sandwich, plunked it down on the table and gave 'er a go.  I felt that the smoked meat burger was ok, not great, but ok.  We told Zane (that would be Caplansky himself) that we thought the burger was dry and we talked about what might help.  How cool was that, gabbing with the Cap-man himself about what the contents of his burgers.  He told us that the staff had been notoriously overcooking the burgers out of fear of the health department and ultimately  this would dry the burger out more, which to us made sense.  To that end I would also say that we thought for $8.00 it was a small burger compared to lets say a Craft Burger.  I also felt the bun was a bit dry which surprised me because I figured they'd be going through a ton of buns and consequently they'd be fresh because they wouldn't be day olds.  

The smoked meat sandwich is really what Zane Caplan built his rep on and his trademark is that they hand cut the smoked meat, in the traditional way that smoked meat sandwiches were always done.  No slicing machines for this joint.  Dea and I like our meat moist so we ordered a fattier sandwich.  You can really taste the smoke in the meat and I love this but the sandwich, like the burger, was ok, not great.  I couldn't put my finger on what was not quite right, but the texture of the meat or perhaps the grain on the cut was off.  

Finally the smoked meat poutine.  Initially I loved this.  The gravy and the chopped up smoked meat and the curds....what's not to love?  (my apologies to all the veggie eaters in the crowd :)  The fries were uber crispy which I really dig as there is nothing worse than soggy fries, especially in poutine.  However it was a bowl of \"spud nuts\" which seemed all like the small little bits and pieces of potatoes.  Lots of crunchy little bits but not much in the way of full pieces of french fries. It left me wanting in that department.  It could be that they cut the potatoes smaller as they serve them in small round soup bowls.   

We washed this meat extravaganza down with some suds from the King Brewery (my neighbhours up here in the hinterland) and it was a really decent glass of Pilsner.  So a big shout out to Phil DeFozzio, the brew meister over at King Brewery!  I was pleased as punch to see a true beer artisan getting his dues in such a high traffic spot like Caplansky's.  

The service was crazy hectic.  Our waitress told us that some of the dinner wait staff didn't show up.  Probably had the crap scared out of them after the madness of the opening.  We kicked back and told her no worries, we wanted to people and restaurant watch and that was exactly what we did.  If we'd been in a hurry though, we'd have been pissed.  I did hear the wait staff tell people though as they were coming in that the kitchen was very backed up and that food could take about half an hour to hit the tables.  At least they were being up front about the craziness.  There are bugs to be worked out as there are in any new restaurant.  

Even at ok, I still would like to say that I really enjoyed the repast at Caplansky's and wish Zane Caplan all the best.  It's a quantum leap from his original digs and he's a hard working, hard smoking meat dude who truly loves what he does.  I suspect Caplansky's will do really well."}
{"text":"My partner really wanted to try Caplansky's Deli so on a trip and layover on Toronto Pearson Airport we had a chance to visit one of their locations.

It is a big restaurant with a very deli style feel to it of course. Lots of tables and you can watch them prepare your food, and you have great views of the runway too.

My celiac partner check with the kitchen and all they had available for her were eggs and beef bacon. She was hoping for moire choices so she was a bit disappointed there.  I was just sharing some of her food as I wasn't all that hungry yet and breakfast isn't much my thing unless it's fruit or a smoothie.

Great place. Lots of great food choices. Not sure how well it can cater to some diets and allergies though."}
{"text":"The chopped liver and salami sandwich tastes like a big sloppy cat food sandwich.  No idea why this is the owners' recommendation on the menu. 

Overpriced for the quality and portions."}
{"text":"great location, love the old signage, food is good, but not MONTREAL, QC smoked meat GOOD...  There is a difference, no doubt.  Plus prices are higher than what I 'feel' i want to pay for the product."}
{"text":"Bf and I decided to try this place last night 
Can't believe a chef/judge from food network would promote this place in anyway let alone own

Bottles of water to start are dirty 
Clean the caps if your going to reuse 
Brisket gravy was terrible
Came on top of knish and poutine
Was no gravy just meat
Need gravy for the dried out pieces of knish that were terrible
The gravy was so cold it did not melt the cheese on poutine

On to the sandwiches 
My pickle looked like it had been used on previous plates during the day
Didn't have the heart to eat it
I asked for the little bit of coleslaw 
I didn't get it

The meat tasted good 
Unfortunately it was very dry and cold

Worst experience at a deli ever
It's a dive, with really bad food 
I couldn't work there as a waitress
I couldn't serve that bad food 

Would never return or recommend 
Just a dying unkept terrible place to eat"}
{"text":"This  place is good.. Its again a far place for me to drive down to but i do .. The 
matzo  soup is awesome .. The smoked corn beef rocks.. I wish the price was a little cheaper.. i guess i  would be asking for to much  lol.. Try it out.. Its worth it .. No Pork Zone for the non pork eaters, thats awesome. 
 Heres  my you tube post on it

{"text":"I am absolutely BAFFLED by the good reviews on here! The smoked meat sandwiches are not only the worst smoke meat sandwiches I have ever had, they are among the worst sandwiches in general I have ever had. 

The smoked meat was EXTREMELY DRY and COMPLETELY tasteless. Worse, the bread was dry and stale and the texture of the meat, the only thing it even contributes, was chewy and unswallowable. The sandwich was so dry overall that I had to take sips of water between bites to even get it down! 

I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and assumed I had just gone on a bad day so I went back again about a year later and had exactly the same experience. 

I have eaten smoked meat sandwiches at the Corned Beef house, Schwartz's, and Carnegie Deli, and loved them all. This place was not even in the same universe as those places.

**Update** I realize this review sounds bad, so I wanted to add, that based on the other reviews here, I can only assume that I just had plain bad luck both times I went. I honestly can't think of any other explanation because there is objectively no way that anyone could give good reviews if they ate the sandwiches I ate."}
{"text":"Great place! The location is nice and it feels cozy inside. It can get pretty crowded as it's popular I guess.

I had the schnitz and deep-fried pickles. It was so good! So tasty! Portions are quite big but I guess I was starving as I finished it all quickly.
My friend had the brisket and she said it was delicious as well.
I definitely recommend this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"As a former Montrealer this place is disappointing to me.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  I've probably eater her a dozen times since its opened, wanting to like it, but every time I am dissapointed.  The smoked meat is really not very good.  It tastes pickled and brinny to me as opposed to smoked.  Those who compare it to Schwartz's in Montreal have no idea what they are talking about.  It's not even close.  It's not even AHL to NHL its Atom league to NHL.  To be honest I probably enjoy a Druxy's smoked meat sandwich more (which is not great either).  Basically, don't believe the hype.  You are probably best of heading to Centre Street Deli which is unfortunately in Thornhill."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Staff makes you feel welcomed as soon as you walk through the door. Service was pretty descent. My fiance ordered the Reubenesque which was out of the world with great flavour. I ordered the \"Latke Poutine\". As a big poutine fan, I felt the potatoes were over cooked and not enough cheese. Also, I felt claustrophobic in the washroom because of a low ceiling.

I would recommend this place to anyone. I would definitely come back, I would just play it safe and order a Smoked Meat sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Found this place (actually my boyfriend found this place because I've been craving chicken and dumpling soup so I guess matzo ball soup is close enough lol)

I had the matzah ball soup and the latkes. The soup was alright... not as great I was expecting for all the of hype. (the matzah ball soup at Whole Foods is better) the potato latkes were alright... just not enough flavor.

I tried a bite of my boyfriend's meat concoction of a sandwich... it was moist and tasty ... just not a huge meat fan"}
{"text":"Not bad of a place.
There were lots of things I wanted to try, but my budget didnt allow it.
I tried the borcsht soup, the fried pickles and the meatloaf dinner.

Borcsht soup was amazing. Very tasty, I nearly even licked the bowl clean. Very hearty and sweet. Would love to go back and buy a jar of their soup.

The fried pickles were excellent as well. Nice and sour pickles.

My only complaint was the meatloaf dinner was kind of garbage. I had garlic mashed potatoes with mine. Didn't taste the mashed potatoes a single bit, and it was pretty flavourless. The meatloaf itself wasn't anything special either and the sweet tomato sauce (almost like ketchup) just masked everything. So I dont really recommend that. Use your money and spend it on the smaller/cheaper stuff.

Great place, might come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best smoked meat place... PERIOD.  Yes I've been to Montreal, and well... this place is better.  The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they don't have an XXL size =(.  Maybe they'll name a plate after me.

When it comes to smoked meat... the fattier the better.  Fat = Flavour = Mouthgazm.  You're given a choice of fatty, medium, lean but I usually either only get fatty or the medium.  What makes the sandwiches so good?  Take a bite... it'll be soft, warm, juicy and delicious.  OMG I'm salivating as I'm writing this right now (I really really wish I had one right now).

There are a bunch of other things on the menu like pickled tongue, gifiltefish (however you spell this), liver and other stuff, but the smoked meat is where it's at.  Really... you have to try it here.  I can't really comment on anything else on the menu, well, because I don't really order anything else.

They also have a bunch of craft beer on tap there incase you want to wash your meat sandwiches down (wait... that kinda sounded wrong).  

I've also seen Caplansky's at multiple events around the city like Luminato and Beerfest, so you'll be able to sample some of their smoked meat if you aren't able to hit up the store.

Now for the kicker... what's smoked meat without mustard??  Caplansky's has got a slew of different mustards from your classic yellow to Caplansky's own store made mustard.  However you take it, be sure that Caplansky's has your mustard needs, well, met."}
{"text":"Very yummy. But we just came back from a trip to Montreal's Shwartz so the smoked meat definitely did not wow us in comparison. But this was the best place we've tried in Toronto. 

Staff was very friendly. We were also able to use our free fries offer from checking in!"}
{"text":"Needed some food before heading to our flight and we had some time to kill. I have to say Terminal 3 has really upped their game. We decided to chow down at Caplansky's - it's been on my list and wanted to compare it to Katz in New York. That was my mistake, you can't really compare any Deli to Katz. 

I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich with fried onions and cheese plus a matzo ball soup. I didn't like the soup, it had zero flavour. The sandwich was pretty good, meat was soft and tender and had a good amount of flavour. My cousins sandwich looked really good and she enjoyed it. 

My only complaint was it took about 20 minutes for us to get our bill, but overall service was fast initially. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Love the breakfast with smoked meat added! Yorkville location is clean, well organized but can get quite busy at lunch. They do accept phone ahead orders for pick up though."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite deli in the city.  I always enjoy the corn beef sandwich with some of the house mustard (mild, because I'm not big on spicy.) The smoked meat poutine will blow your face off with its awesomness.  The service is always great.  The food is always out of this world.  Check. this. place. out."}
{"text":"This place claims to have the best corned beef but it just doesn't.  I was really disappointed.  They taste close to how Druxy's used to be, which is really bad.  We came down just to try their food.  The matzo ball soup was hard.  Their corned beef was hard too.  I really wanted to like this place since I heard so many good things about them.  It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Sad Sad Sad! Brunch. Service was slow. My friends ordered at the same time as i did but i had to wait ten minutes for my \"special breakfast\" to arrive. the manager said it was because he had sent the first order of eggs back because they were too over done. it was a shame he neglected to notice the burnt offering that was supposed to be the in house smoked beef bacon. the eggs were more than over easy...they were over raw. The meatloaf in the meatloaf sandwitch was moist to the point of being soggy. The only thing on the table that was good (but not great in the Motreal sense) was the smoked meat sandwich. With the pletora of Brunch shops along the College strip you'll do yourself a favor and keep on walkin' by. Try Free Times next block east."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome especially their condiment bar where you can help yourself to as many and as much sauces and pickled vegetables you want. I had the rubenesque, and it was a lot smaller than I thought but it was delicious nonetheless. I had a greek salad with mine and it was alright, but I regret not getting fries or their potato pancakes. Expect to spend about $20+ when you eat here!"}
{"text":"Wow. $9 for the worst Smoked Meat Sandwich I have ever had. Tasted like it had middle eastern spices or something. Really odd. Do not get it as it's not what you're expecting. Cool decor. Bagel and Lox was apparently ok, how bad can you screw up smoked salmon and a bagel."}
{"text":"Had a really lovely New Years Day brunch here this afternoon. Was served by the owner who was giving every diner warm wishes. Loved the smoked meat and egg scramble. My friend had the smoked meat hash, which mixed with the scrambled eggs was awesome. Only thing that was a miss were the latkes. Pretty flavourless and very small. Service was kind of slow but it was New Years so that was to be expected. Yay Caplansky's! I love you again."}
{"text":"My wife Sandy and I spent the day in TO at the St Lawrence then Kensington Market, which BTW is so full of smug hipsters I think I will avoid from on.
The place, really looks the part of a deli, smaller than I expected. Service is efficient maybe not all that friendly. Salad was a greek, no sauce and confetti feta which was tasteless. Sammy was good. Smoked meat, not all that big frankly and came with a pickle. We had water. So 35 for 2 sandwiches my wife seemed OK with. I guess, though the food was good. Didn't strike me as being what I expected. I'm indifferent I don't dislike it, but maybe I am just cheap."}
{"text":"Fan of Schwartz's smoked meat? Miss it here in TO? Yeah then Caplansky's is a very solid replacement. Their smoked meat is great (get it with house mustard) but they also have an excellent brunch menu (try their smoked meat hash!).  Split pea soup is also superb."}
{"text":"The meal we had here while visiting Toronto, and were very pleased. Especially and surprisingly good was the poutine with smoked meat, yum!! The smoked meats here are quite fine, and I believe you can choose how lean (or fatty) you want to have it in your entree or sandwich. The deli's own rye beer (served with a pickle) was also a nice touch. Our server was very efficient and personable and even brought me a dessert of my choosing as it was my birthday! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"My son and I go here pretty regularly on Sunday mornings. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the service is always great. I really enjoy the mint tea and you can't go wrong with beef bacon, I could eat a pound of it... My son loves the pickles."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for Beyonce, it's probably good enough for you too. This smoked meat haven makes a mean Reuben: thinly sliced smoked meat that melts in your mouth.

Or try the CFC: buttermilk-fried chicken w/ coleslaw, lettuce, tomatoes & Russian dressing.

Get latkes on the side instead of fries, you won't regret it.

And then, pick up some pickles at...the pickle bar, if that's your thing.

Incredibly friendly staff and Instagram-worthy floor tiles."}
{"text":"So full disclosure off the bat, I'm invoking value in rating this restaurant.

The food itself is about 3.5 stars.  It's relatively straightforward Jewish deli food.  I've enjoyed the reuben sandwich and the corned beef.  I'm guessing its homemade, but I'm not sure.  The corned beef was a bit dry, but not terrible.  Bread couldn't hold up to the meat.  They make a big deal about their house mustards, but again not sure they're homemade either.  Fries were fine...under-cooked though.

I'll get to the punchline though, the value stinks.  Lunch pricing: A sandwich and fries is $13.95.  A reuben with no sides other than a pickle is $13.  A bagel, lox, and cream cheese platter is a whopping $18.  So my last meal of a corned beef with fries with tax and tip ended up at a whopping $18.50!  For a basic sandwich and fries with water.  Where's the linen?  Where's the fancy cheese?  

Service is fine...hit and miss.  Your order, they bring food, maybe a refill on water.

Basically, it's diner food at gourmet prices.  I've eaten here twice, and just learned my lesson.  At this price point for lunch, I have far higher expectation.  You can and should just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's a good little deli. They use Silverstein's bread for their sandwiches, which I like. I had a sandwich there, but I couldn't finish it. It's kind of big! If you're in the area and like Jewish deli style food, go here. :)"}
{"text":"Definitely unique to Zane. I give him kudos for many very good products. Exceptional items to chose from. Love the spicy mustard. Love the local beers even better. Will love to see what Guy of Triple D thinks of the joint!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few spots to eat at terminal 3 in the Toronto airport and the only one that we saw with table service so we stopped in for lunch on our layover.

SERVICE: friendly and warm, food came out pretty quick

FOOD: I had the shredded brisket sandwich which was was hearty and big although a little chewy, fries were crispy and hot but we're a separate side for $5

OVERALL: decent place and better than standing at a counter or hovering on a bar stool."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong.  You cannot go wrong.

I've had their sandwiches a few times from the food trucks, and I decided to venture here today with a friend for lunch.  Goodness gracious these sandwiches are amazing no matter what.  My hands still smell like the smoked meat sandwich right now, and I want to lick them.

TMI?

Anyhow, great service.  We had a waiter named Elliot, and he was so entertaining and so friendly.

Also - if you check in with yelp or foursquare - you get free fries.  Can't go wrong with that, right?"}
{"text":"I really, REALLY want to like this place. I am a sucker for Jewish delis, and I've been here a few times with friends and family, and I always get so excited when I come here or order from here...but the food has always been decent but underwhelming. I have tried several things on the menu, and most of it is just \"okay.\" 

My most recent meal (ordered through Hurrier and delivered for me to eat in the comfort of my condo) was a continuation of this theme. I ordered the smoked meat poutine, which was like a creative and interesting idea, but the smoked meat just tasted...off. The fries and cheese were just \"okay.\" I ate it, because it was there, but I was disappointed.

I also ordered fried chicken, which is maybe an odd choice for a self-proclaimed fan of deli meat to order at a deli, but I was having a craving. The chicken, too, was just \"okay,\" although I do admit to having very high standards for fried chicken...but there wasn't much meat on the bone and the chicken tasted a bit slimy, which was an odd experience for me, since I've eaten so much fried chicken in my life and seldom had this happen. I ate it; it was edible; but it didn't satisfy my craving at all, and I was sad. :( 

Their deli meats are good, though, so perhaps I will stick to those next time. Pastrami...yum!"}
{"text":"You're not gonna find better smoked meat in Toronto. It's different from Montreal smoked meat, but just as good. The smoked meat sandwich on rye, the smoked meat poutine were excellent. And they had black cherry soda! True, it was Cott's, but it's still black cherry soda. The burger was saltier than I like and the slaw was ok and a bowl of free pickles would've been a nice touch like at delis in NYC, but who cares, the real star is the smoked meat."}
{"text":"Well -- we headed over to Caplansky's for brunch this weekend.
I have to say that I am surprised in some ways that we had never been here before, despite lots of recs from friends.

Well here is what I can say:

FOOD 

I had the corned beef hash with a side of latkes.  Wonderful hash and wonderful latkes.  Applesauce definitely homemade.  Latkes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Just the way they should be!

My hubby had the breakfast special which was French Toast made with Chocolate Babka -- OMG!!!  To die for -- you folks need to add this to your menu as a regular item.  Lots of Dark Chocolate on this one.  Just one thing, perhaps rather than maple syrup, serve it with vanilla sauce.  It would balance the richness.... but even still -- wonderful!
It was served with Beef Bacon, which was actually pretty good. 

SERVICE 

Service was friendly and prompt - not rushing us, but just right.

AMBIANCE

Deli ambiance -- good sized patio.  The only thing - it was rather warm out and for those of us that would rather sit inside than out, well the a/c was pretty non-existent.  Frankly this is the reason for the 3-star vs a 4-star.

However, I can say we will definitely be back, but we will avoid warm days or go for the patio.

I noticed some deli sandwiches going by --- looked great also.  The guy next to us ordered cheesecake -- yep, that's on my list to try next time!

So -- there's a reason that Caplansky's has been around for a while, and we'll be back again."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place and ducked in to check out their menu. The guy behind the counter (perhaps Mr. Caplansky himself) was SO helpful and nice, we decided to stay. He patiently explained the menu to us - was in no hurry. Had the Reubenesque ($13) which comes with swiss cheese, Russian dressing and sauerkraut, hubby had their classic and kiddo had the poutine. The sandwiches were delicious - no Schwartz but i think the welcoming atmosphere and hospitality knocked it out of the park for us! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tuesday, 9 March 2010, noon.

Today my cousin and I had lunch at the new Caplansky's in the old neighbourhood where we grew up.

The kishka was excellent. The smoked meat sandwich (7 oz medium) was, at best, dry and mediocre. The fries were grossly overcooked. The coffee was not up to today's standards of any greasy spoon. The microscopic sliver of dill pickle hiding on the plate was an insult. There was an interesting selection of mustards on the table some of which came in sticky, gooey jars into which one would have to dip one's knife. Health inspectors where are you?

The music was much too loud which made the customers talk to loudly. It was a very noisy and unpleasant atmosphere.

The waiter was incompetent and although there seemed to be plenty of staff, I don't know what they were doing other than ignoring the customers by not using their peripheral vision as some servers are inclined to do.

Based on what we received, Caplansky's is badly overpriced and a big disappointment. We have no intention of returning there but, perhaps, in three or, perhaps, six months we might have another go at it just to be fair."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: I'm reviewing and rating Caplansky's strictly on my experience with their food and not so much their service since I always get take out. I've never dined in this restaurant because the opportunity hasn't presented itself.

Caplansky's has some really amazing smoked meat sandwiches! Their sandwich combos are great but for someone with a small stomach like me, the sandwich normally suffices. With their HUGE portions of smoked meat between two thin pieces of bread, this is the place I go to when I want a hearty meal. The meat is flavourful and not dry at all. Their Dijon mustard is awesome too!

I also really like their salad but it's extremely overpriced if you just get the full salad..  For their smoked meat dishes, I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been there for lunch. Looks like the menu is a bit more extensive now. 

Was not happy that I went there for lunch and the entire room was smoky. Meal was good. Service was good for lunch!"}
{"text":"Being a U of T student this is a short walk away and I brought my boyfriend down to see me so we chose to try this since we've heard SO much about it. The whole Dragon's den, you gotta eat here, etc. hype sucked us in. Well that's just what it is. Hype. Starting from the service. We wanted to try something that was on the daily specials on another day and since it wasn't available a server passing by gave us a suggestion to just add some of those components to an already available sandwich. My boyfriend wanted to get some sauerkraut on his smoked meat. When our actual server came up to us he ordered the smoked meat and asked for sauerkraut on it. Do you know what she said. \"No you can't\". It's not the no that I was taken aback by because if something can't be done it can't but as a person who works in food service mine would be, \"I'm sorry no, it's not available due to...\" But when he asked \"Why?\" the reply was \"It doesn't work like that.\" We were hungry and just replied with an \"Alright\" and ordered our meals. He got the smoked meat and I got the brisket. His was I believe 13 dollars with tax and I'm not talking a huge sandwich. I'm taking a small sandwich I would give my 5 year old cousin and some fries, which by the way you could tell were bottom of the fryer fries. I felt so bad that I pretended I was full after a few bites so he could eat the rest of my food since he had been waiting for this all day. And I literally smelled like meat the entire day and we were only in there for about half an hour. If the food was great and service was great I wouldn't have mentioned this detail but it wasn't worth it. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the brisket that I ordered. I prefer it sliced and they served it shredded. It did have somewhat of a good flavor but nothing out of this world.  This was also my first time trying Matzo Ball soup. I was regretting ordering it after a few bites but slowly started tasting better. I do regret ordering the brisket and should of just stuck with their Reuben. Hey did have a mustard and pickle bar which I thought was pretty cool."}
{"text":"You know the drill....get to the airport 3 hours before an International flight and there's no line up at the airline counter or security, so you're through very fast and then have over two hours to kill. You don't want to nap as the flight is long and you hope to hell you get to sleep on the plane.
Facing that daunting scenario, we wandered aimlessly looking for a place to eat. Settled on this place.
I've never been to a Caplansky's so I didn't know what to expect. The waitress was over fairly quickly (the place wasn't that busy) and she was fantastic. Friendly, animated, and bubbly. We ordered our food (Montreal Smoked Meat).
Food arrived after about 10-15 minutes, within the time frame one would expect. One of us loved it, me....I was meh (I didn't hate it, but didn't love it). It was, IMO, overpriced, but it's an airport so it's to be expected.
Would I go back......there's not a lot of options in this area of the airport, but I think I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"So nice to have this at the airport. Got a Reuben, or a Reubenesque as they call it. Grilled cheese for the kiddies.  And blintzes with blueberry compote. Yummy! The ricotta filling is the best. Makes us wanna go to the downtown Toronto location next time we're out here. Go Caplansky's!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their tasty roubenesque sandwich with my girlfriend on a saturday afternoon. The place was busy but not packed and they had many servers and staff however, after waiting on the table for some time for the server, we finally get the attention of one that couldnt even wait for us to finish our words before turning her back on us and ignoring us for the rest of the dinner with this im too busy for you grin. Later after more waiting a more friendly server came to take the order but again couldnt wait for us to even fisnish our words before leaving the table, which is very rude and not the way to treat your guest. The food came to the table and was good but not exceptional. Good luck getting their attention for some cuttlery or napkings! At the time of the bill we realized they charged us $1 for a slice of bread. Little details like this that bust your patience. As a Kensington Market restaurant owner I feel this place is a big scam. too much superhero publicity but with no soul and cold service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic. The service was great and the food tasted so splendid. I ordered cabbage borsch soup and Latkes. Sadly the had run out of sour cream but to my surprise they went and bought us some. Great little restaurant, highly recommended for a nice lunch or any meal. All day breakfast here as well."}
{"text":"How is this place not rated higher?!

The meat here is fantastic, the sandwiches are to die for and the soups and latkes are always warm and comforting. Service will come with a smile and the mustard selection always makes me happy.

Writing this is making me want to stop by for dinner tonight. I think I will."}
{"text":"Caplansky's was simply great. We found it on Boxing Day, when nothing else was open, and what a gem! The French Toast was divine, but all the sugar one needs for a week. My BF's sandwich was great, though the rye could have been better. Super groovin' & hip vibe. Friendly customer service, although somewhat inattentive and slow. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Old style Eastern European Jewish food.  Unfortunately variable quality when it is done well its great when its not its horrible. 

Service is slow so make site you have time to eat. 

Best food knish and sandwiches.  

Hit or miss soups and breakfasts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the 14oz smoked meat sandwich. It wasn't as fatty as I'd like, but still very tasty. They probably would let you specify the cut. The service was phenomenal and smiley/happy. If I still went to UofT I'd go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Went because a friend saw it on the Food Network and said it looked \"mad good\". Food and service was really good. Had smoked meat sandwich and my girlfriend had latke poutine. Both very tasty. Would like to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I most recently visited their new yorkville location. I think the gig is up overall on caplansky's. Of top priority the smoked meat is dry and tasteless. The latkes were swimming in oil and over cooked as well as flavorless. There were about 10 random people that came into the shop and lined up to order and almost the same 10 were a few minutes later lined up to complain about such things as missing order items, overcharged (by twice the amount), sour cream that had gone bad..... I had Schwartz's in Montreal last month and they are not comparable. Caplansky's is Maybe more like Druxy,s just pricier and therefore not worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"Not sure about all the low reviews but my experience was great. There were only two waitresses and the place was packed so I expected service to be a bit slower. Ordered the smoked meat hash with eggs and toast for $14. Price is way up there but this is what to expect when you want convenience.

On the menu, this dish is one of the recommended dishes so I just went with it. The smoked meat hash was great and the rye toast was excellent. My only complaint is that I wish I had more. Our server was amazing and she even had time to check on us and refill our coffee without asking even though it was so busy."}
{"text":"Got the smoked meat combo for $13.95
You get a choice of fries, salad or hash brown. I went with the hash brown. As always these sandwiches come with a dill pickle. I really hate dill pickles so it always ends up in the garbage.
Portions are very generous here. When I saw the hash brown I thought they had brought a full meal to the wrong table it was so huge. The smoked meat was oh so soft and tender. This is what they specialize in and it was indeed one of the better smoked meat sandwiches I have had."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to complain here. A Caplansky takeout was brought in to my workplace for lunch, and I was blown away. Bread was soft and the smoked meat packed between the slices were tender and flavourful. Fries were alright; flavour was standard, but the amount was good. I'll definitely drop by to try some more stuff off the menu!"}
{"text":"Featured on \"You Got To Eat Here\"

***Warning*** Small Portions***Small Portions****and you pay for a sandwich $15.00 (price+Tax+Tip) and walk away hungry..typical in Canada by the way!

**Fries cut as match box size, so it burns while frying them..head up chef....
Go again? ummmmmmmm ........I don't know"}
{"text":"Jewish Delis are my thing.  If you would like to read the rhapsodies that I have penned, feel free to look at my previous reviews.  In short I am a deli snob who has been to the best of the best here in NYC, and though Caplansky's falls short on the meat, it excels in everything else.

Caplansky's from the look of it is an old school deli- packed with people, packed with life, hustle and bustle, and people just enjoying themselves and good food.  Perfecto!  With that said, when I went there was a wait for large parties, but if you are by yourself sit at the bar.  This is always where the action happens anyway.

Meats:
They have hot and cold sandwiches, and of the warm varieties turkey, roast beef, and smoked meat.  Smoked is their specialty and so that is what I went with.  They ask you if you want lean, medium, or fatty cuts of meat.  If you haven't been there before they recommend medium.  I on the other hand will say if you enjoy delis, always go with Fatty!  

When the sandwich came out, it was of average size compared to the NYC varieties.  And when I took a bite the meat was kind of just so-so.  The lean meat had almost of a prepackaged lunch meat taste.... BUT... BUT... the fatty meat on the other hand was where it was at.  Filled with the rub and the best cut of the meat.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it... my heart, maybe not so much.

Where Caplansky's really shines is in their cheesecake.  I ordered up a slice and it was absolutely divine.  So thick, but airy.. does that make sense?  Who cares.  The taste is all that matters.  It was so thick that it took me literally 10 minutes to finish.

With that said Caplansky's does it right in my book.  Good service, good atmosphere, amazing cheesecake and so-so meats.  If I go back I would get an all fatty cut or try the turkey.

Sandwiches are about 8 bucks, cheesecake 7, and beers about 7.50.  You can get sandwich combo for about 15.00.

I might have been in a foreign country, but I definitely felt like home at Caplansky's."}
{"text":"heard about this place from an article and was surprised to see only 3.5 stars on Yelp because I'd heard great things about it. it was right by our hostel so we went for lunch anyway.  a little on the expensive side in my opinion for a sandwich. (14$) We ordered the rubenesque (had almost no sauerkraut and dressing) and the tuna melt (very dry :() Sandwiches come with a pickle and chips. French fries however are awesome and crispy and there is an extensive mustard selection. Not mad that we went but not dying to go back."}
{"text":"not gonna lie, I went for their maple bacon donuts & ended up eating a sandwich..... truly overrated. DH likes their smoked meat. I wasn't impressed. 

the donut holes are definitely not as delicious as one would hope or as rumored - timbits & Denny's pancake bites are even waaaay better. a plain tasting donut hole, drowning in average syrup & topped with a few pieces of bacon. not what I envisioned for a fantastic MBD!  Dont be fooled by the hype. Go to the Beast for a much better version:-)"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants in Toronto! There's a large menu with lots of great choices. Everything I've eaten was amazing! My favorite is usually the smoked meat sandwich and a side order of deep fried pickles."}
{"text":"Not surprised to hear that this location closed. I live a block away I used to go there all the time but the quality in the last 2 or 3 years has been awful. We're talking frozen burger patties and impossibly dry and fatty smoked meat sandwiches. Overpriced considering what you get too. Apparently I'm not the only one who thought this because it never looked busy whenever I walked by."}
{"text":"There is a God, and he loves us all very much.

There's no way to adequately sum up the amazing institution that is Caplansky's.   Finally, a place that understands that a Deli is actually meant to be the social center of a community.... so much more than just a simple place of nourishment or a plain old lunch spot.    

The phenomenal sandwiches and spectacular sides serve as a catalyst to providing patrons with a momentary emotional escape from the problems of their day.   The second you walk up the stairs of the Monarch tavern, it all fades away.

The food is perfect.  Well seasoned, well smoked slices of Pastrami... served in generous portions for $6 a pop.   Fries that make you want that quadruple bypass.   Homemade mustard that is worth the trip just by itself.

The only dilemna of Caplansky's is that you arguably cannot go every day without also joining a gym.    A small price to pay for perfection."}
{"text":"We LOVE caplanskys on college st, we go all the time and never have anything but amazing things to say about it. So you have to understand our excitement and expectations when we saw it in the airport! 

Total let down.

I'm not sure if they were understaffed or if the staff just didn't give a shit - although I feel it's the latter. 

We were sat at the bar and waited 15 minutes to be greeted, after my husband had to ask a server if anyone was assigned to the bar. Another 15 minutes later and my husbands pop got to him.... I was handed an empty coffee mug as my tea with nothing to accompany it. Ordered our food and watched two groups of 4 sit at the bar as well, one of which left after waiting 20 minutes to be talked to. 

My food was okay I guess, cold, but edible. My husbands on the other hand, looked like cat food and tasted worse. We left to look for something for him to eat after still having to pay for his meal.

Watched a woman seated at a table behind us get her own coffee and get scolded by a server because \"that's dangerous and she could have killed herself\" meanwhile the girl tried to explain that she had asked for a coffee 30 minutes ago and had already eaten her food without it.

Pretty sad and not the impression that caplanskys deserves as their downtown location is so great."}
{"text":"While everything on the menu looks great. The winner hands done is the smoked meat sandwich and deep fried pickles. I great place to take people from out of town."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to this well publicized delicatessen. I am not familiar with Jewish dishes so I was excited to visit this place simply due to hype. Well, it's overrated. My partner has never been there either but he saw this place on few TV shows so he was very anxious to visit the place as well.

Place is nice and bright, kind of 60's atmosphere and clean, which is good part, we were seated right away, why is also a plus. And our server was a young friendly woman, also a plus, but the great streak unfortunately end there.

When I saw the Knish that they have served on local magazine, it was much bigger on picture than actual size., It was $9 and did not come with side dishes unless you order it separately despite the small portion of the main dish. My partner ordered dinner portion of beef brisket dinner  for $16 I believe... Although his dish was fulfilling size, meat was completely cold and felt that it has been sitting on the counter for a while, and when we complained about it, I think they've microwaved it for few minutes and brought it back.

As for dessert, we've tried \"Maple bacon donuts\" just to see what it maybe, it was 3 pieces of grossly deep fried dough with maple syrup and nothing more.  

I don't think I am going back there anytime near future, or further future unless they make some serious changes."}
{"text":"We came here for a snack while on our way to Kensington Market.  We sat on their shaded patio and we shared a smoked meat sandwich served on a bagel-y sort of bread (like halfway between bagel and bread).  The meat was saucy, tender, rich, and glorious.  Finger-licking good, to be sure!  The menu was a little pricey, but service was friendly and it is no wonder the smoked meat here is famous."}
{"text":"Smoke Meat on the Menu @caplanskysdeli 

So my first visit in the #yorkville location. Could not decide on what to have and it was a difficult one. But when in doubt in a #jewish #deli you should go for the classic #smokedmeat 

Well, what a treat. I got to try a few of these famous mustards and off a cool tap system. A first for me. #mustardontap 

The #borscht was meaty and delicious and I could have had a double portion. 

The best was last in the piled high classic smoked meat sandwich on rye bread.  My grandmother would be proud. Soft and tasty meat and your choice of the 5 mustards and some side garnishings.  The Kosher pickle was essential in this lunch. 

Thank you @caplansky for keeping the tradition alive and making Toronto Jewish Deli  a hot spot again. Mazel Tov.

{"text":"Probably the best smoked meat I've had in Toronto. Ordered their sampler platter with all sorts of stuff on it. Tongue, smoked meat, liver, etc. Loved the smoke meat and tongue sandwiches."}
{"text":"A triumph in every way imaginable to the service, to the food, to the vibe."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for brunch for the first time after seeing them featured on You Gotta Eat Here and Triple D.  It was busy and we lined up with a one year old but the wait wasn't too bad at all... Around 15 min.

I ordered the leaning tower of Caplansky's, which was this stuffed French toast made with challah bread and layered with blueberry compote and stuffed with cream cheese topped with beef bacon.  My husband had a smoked meat scramble.  Both were really good and not too sweet.  We also bought some smoked meat to go and my husband got a nice lunch the next day.

Service was decent and quick... Though food seemed to take awhile to come.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I found great street parking that is definitely worth 1 star on its own. Then I happened to go in when there was no line up. The guy at the counter was really nice and took my order, it definitely did in my 4 month pregnant craving for some smoked meat and fries. Oh, beware, they dont have regular poutine, its only with smoked meat...it was still good though :)

It was a little hard to eat because it was cut so thick...I wonder if I can request thinly sliced???"}
{"text":"I thought the quality of the food at Caplansky's was quite good - nothing mind-blowing but definitely good food. Four types of mustards were a nice touch.

I thought that the prices were a bit high for what you got and the service was a bit negligent. Our sides came at least 5 minutes before the meat sandwiches came, which was annoying.There was a huge line outside and the staff didn't seem interested in bringing us our bill even though our plates had been cleared."}
{"text":"I am sure they should close down as a restaurant deli and open up as a PR shop. Seriously, this deli has better skills at landing itself in the news and getting free advertising than delivering good food. The chicken is the most tasteless chicken since Mandarin. Their so-called famous deli smoked meat sandwiches would be banished to a street cart if this were Montreal. Service was really friendly and not rushed with a personality though. Overall though food-wise Shame. Seriously."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, for directing me to this place!  I've been dying to find a great Jewish deli/cafe for ages, and now I have.  I went this morning, and thankfully, there was no lineup; being Tuesday at 10:30am...I didn't really expect one.  Zane (I believe is his name) was there to greet me and welcome me in.  I was surprised by the size and airiness of the place...so many windows and a great view of the street; the photos don't do that justice.  I'd had breakfast within the past 2 hours, so I didn't want anything heavy.  I had the bagel and lox platter.  Impressed!  Plenty of lox, a nice fresh bagel, capers, cukes, tomats, onions, and a great array of mustard...especially the Kozlik's Canadian Mustard.  I had the horserasdish/mustard combo.  PLENTY of cream cheese.  It was perfect for something not too heavy.  The matzoh ball soup was also a treat.  My server (didn't get his name) was friendly, quick, and made me feel right at home.  No attitude there!  I can't wait to go back and try something really greasy!!"}
{"text":"When it come to comfort food I choose this place. The deli meats remind me of the summer days when my dad would take me to the local deli for a smoke meat or corned beef sandwich on rye during his lunch break. I had the beef brisket and I swear it was prime rib. So good! Paired that with veggies, mashed potatoes, a dark ale and trust me friend you have a winning combo."}
{"text":"Rare that I find restraints where you order and pay first then have your seat. Strolled in here for a breakfast because I was feeling more meatier as oppose to the dessert breakfasts. 

Opted for the smoked meat hash with an extra serving of smoked meat on the side. Was introduced to their pickle bar along with the other condiments. Food arrived in a reasonable manner. 

At first glance, I really didn't think it was much food. After the first bite, I couldn't help but to have bite after bite. Everything was perfect. The staff was at tentative. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I am no connoisseur of Montreal style smoked meat, so let me just get that out of the way. I've eaten it a couple times in Montreal, but it's been so long that I can hardly remember it well enough to compare Caplansky's with it.

But in and of itself, I can't imagine enjoying a sandwich much more than the one I had at Caplansky's on Friday. I had a lean 7oz sandwich - the waiter warned me that it would be dry, but I took the risk... If you like brisket flat, there's no reason that you would be displeased with their lean smoked meat. The taste is just..special. As I said I'm no connoisseur, but to me Caplansky's tasted like something halfway between your usual smoked meat and (real) barbecue brisket. Which is ideal for me - two cravings with one stone. And since I haven't been able to find decent brisket anywhere else in Toronto yet, that means Caplansky's is going to be doubly important in my life from now on. (No, the sauce-laden fatty crap that gets called 'BBQ brisket' here is not what I am talking about.) So yes - the smoked meat here is very impressive, lives up to the hype, and IMHO deserves 5 stars.

Everything else is incidental. The fries are great though, and given the awesomeness of their meat, I can only imagine how delicious things like smoked meat poutine, or smoked meat hash and eggs would be.  They were out of smoked turkey and liver when we went (not a concern for me!). The girlfriend had the special offering though: a tongue sandwich. I was much too squeamish to try that - in fact, I was prepared to have a taste, but as soon as I touched the meat I knew I couldn't eat it. Just absurdly soft and fine-grained as organ meats are... She loved it, and perhaps you would too, so I won't knock it... but just thinking about it now gives me the willies. 

Decent selection of beer too. They had a 'Number 9 IPA' on draught which I hadn't tried before, and it was really fantastic. First time I've been impressed with an IPA in a while. So all in all...nothing bad to say about this place! But go midafternoon when there's no wait."}
{"text":"Family Day: the resturant was packed . The food was delicious... Had the Reuben , coleslaw and their chips! The chips are super tasty.... Crunchy and huge! The sandwich was everything a Reuben should be! This location is EPIC... The mustard station and the unlimited pickles...pickled tomatoes  and pickled peppers can be a meal in itself... wow!! Great spot in Yorkville, comfort food, small menu and great staff!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment before....Visited again a week ago. The place was not busy...Corned beef sandwich dry...service poor...surly wait staff... food overpriced and not as good as other Jewish deli's in Toronto, Montreal or New York...A fellow diner remarked that the owner, Zane Caplansky was sponsoring the Palestinian Film Festival. Perhaps that is why he has put up his prices....and made portions smaller...overall experience Meh..or even Bleh....Won't go there again...and what to say about  the washroom ??... Don't even go there......"}
{"text":"Ordered the matzaball soup through UberEats. It comes with one small matzaball and the soup was tasteless. It was hot and I've eaten in the resto before and it was ok. I'm a bit dissapointed."}
{"text":"Not a good start. We were told to take up a table that was just freed up, but not cleared. Then we waited and waited and waited....when I asked a server to help us (since there was no menu at the table either), she said, \"I'm busy and you sat at a table that was not cleared.\" When I told her we were told to sat here, at least she changed her tone and came back right away.
It's very busy here, so even with three servers they are having a hard time keeping up.
Food are alright. The meat are a little overcooked, but seasoning is on point."}
{"text":"My friend had the smoked turkey sandwich which was alright, I thought it was sort of overrated as the whole sandwich just seemed....microwaved and not really worth it? I liked the accompanying mustard and I am usually not a mustard fan at all. The saving grace of the night was the smoked meat poutine which had the thinnest, albeit yummiest fries and the gravy was just right. It could've used more cheese curds but as a side, it was enough to feed myself and then some. 
The servers were really attentive and friendly. When the bill arrived, our waiter even made the sandwich & poutine a combo at no extra charge #win! 
I liked the puns on the shirts and while waiting for my meal, I even contemplated buying one of those mesh-back hats, however, had the meal been absolutely A+ I probably would have left with a new piece of comical head wear. 
I'm definitely returning so maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Speaking on behalf of my Sunday late morning/early afternoon experiences I really enjoy going to Caplanksy's! They have a good selection on their breakfast menu, and the service on Sunday morning is consistently great.. especially from a few. 

To date my favourite dish is the smoked meat hash. Each time it varies in some way but it is consistently delicious and filling. Although, I have tried the fries and chips off of the plate of others and I see why they are my co-workers favourite. They are really yummy and dangerously easy to eat and may be worth getting a side of to try. I would recommend Caplansky's to anyone looking for a casual place to grab a bite.. and definitely if you are in the mood for smoked meat hash."}
{"text":"While on vacation in August I searched ahead of time for a unique place to eat while in Toronto. I wanted somewhere I couldn't find anywhere else and also a place that had good poutine on the menu. I came across Caplansky's and was intrigued by the story behind the restaurant and with the menu. I decided to try to make this a part of our stay.  We were scheduled to be in town for only one night but I was craving some poutine. When I was a kid we traveled to Toronto for the day. While there we had these amazing thick cut, double fried French fries smothered in rich brown meat gravy served from a street side food truck. Keep in mind this was way before the current food truck phenomenon. I don't remember there being cheese curds, but it must have been an option. I've never forgotten that experience, or the taste. And I've never had it repeated. Heck, I didn't even know what the dish was called until about a year ago. While listening to The Splendid Table podcast one day I heard Jane and Michael Stern talk about the dish. We ended up not arriving to the restaurant until after 9pm. We were the only one's there. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was great. We had such a good time and the food was to die for. My six year old son loved being able to watch the meat being craved for our meal. He was mesmerized. I had the poutine and it was great. My daughter had the latke poutine and I got to try a little bit. It also was great. Thanks for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Of course, no review here is complete unless it mentions the smoked meat sandwich.

Tip about the smoked meat sandwich: it comes in fatty, medium, or lean (not specified on the menu!). Sometimes the waiter/waitress asks what you want, sometimes not. Whatever you do, always ask for the fatty sandwich.

Sometimes they don't hear you or maybe they don't pay attention or something... and you end up with a lean sandwich instead of the amazing fatty sandwich. I'm not sure if they actively ignore requests sometimes because the fatty meat is probably more expensive, but at the very least make sure that they know you freakin' want the fatty sandwich.


As for everything else, it's all good. Fries are great. If you run into the food truck, I recommend the smoked meat poutine.

If they gave me a fatty sandwich every single time I asked for one, I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of delis and meats, and when I found out about this place from the food network show \"you gotta eat here\", I said to myself I need to go and try it out. Also kicking myself that I've been living in Toronto for 14 years and never heard of this place is sad. The smell is what greet you first, and it was warm, salty, and aromatic. We seated ourselves and started looking at the menu. It was a typical Jewish deli with smoked meat, smoked tongue, smoked turkey breast, liver, etc. I made my choice fast and took the smoke meat with what else extra meat. My gf  choice the smoked meat poutine and, we shared a liver. Everything arrive at the same time and fast. First of all, the amount of food is insane, the 2 pieces of rye bread compare to the meat on the plate was tiny. I didn't not mind that a bit. They have 4 types of mustard, all of them house made and possibly the best you'll ever have in Toronto. I love the \" mild and delicious\", with just enough kick it complimented the sandwich. The liver was creamy and  melts in my mouth. Poutine was huge and very tasty. We couldn't finish everything and took home left over for lunch the next day, but not before buying a lb of smoke meat and 2 bottles of mustard. All in all, this place is amazing and definitely one of the best delis in the city. Will visit as often as I possibly could. 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of classic deli sandwiches but Caplanskys fell short of expectations. I was expecting the smoked meat to be full of flavor and tender but instead it was rubbery and a non descript taste. 

Selection of condiments was a great touch, but shouldn't be required in order to enjoy this type of meal. I'd try again but would definitely get something different."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly owner and amazing atmosphere (even spotted a tv personality). But really who cares when you are given a spot crammed in between 2 tables with literally no privacy, the food comes over semi warm and the smoked meat hash I received was a cause for a serious tummy ache. Really and truely all those awards outside are a shame. Ps I am a chef and I know what I'm talking about this is just another blown up overhyped and over expensive comfort diner that only fine caters to celebs and tv personalities not paying careful attention to the needs of the average diner."}
{"text":"Cute concept in downtown Toronto. I tried the smoked meat sandwich with the honey mustard (Russian I believe it was?) and took it across the street to the rock/park area with a few friends. The bread was sturdy enough to contain the pile of thickly-sliced meat, and held up to my dipping and dunking. Don't skimp on the pickle and sauce bar. Oh, and skip the latkes if you have a small stomach or if you're watching your carbo intake."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a disappointing experience.

When visiting Toronto, it's fun and exciting to try something new. It doesn't always work out.

I'll get this out of the way...the smoked meat is fantastic. Everything else...was not. The salami was dry. The matzoh ball soup was like two pieces of bread floating in slightly yellow water (no flavor whatsoever). I asked my friend what she ordered so I could reference it and she said, \"I can't remember. Please don't make me think about it again\".

Our table had been wiped, but only directly in front of the seats. The middle of the table had crumbs and debris. The condiment dispensers had caked on dried mustard that looked like it had been there for a week. The floor was filthy and got worse the further under the table you looked (clearly the staff has been trained to simply spot sweep...shouldn't it be getting done thoroughly at least once a day). 

There are better delis and there are probably better options within a two block radius. Take the walk."}
{"text":"Poutine it is. And not just any Poutine. Smoked meat Poutine. I am glad that I just got the small because I inhaled that so fast my hubby had to ask for some. 
Loved the decor and fun things to read while you wait

Hubby had the leaning tower french toast loaded with cream cheese and covered with blueberries. Cover that with Canadian maple syrup and dig in."}
{"text":"I've always had their smoked meat deli sandwich to go so on a lazy Sunday, my friends and I decided to grab a bite before spending walking down queen street. The sandwiches are usually pretty and quite meaty. 

Decided to try their poutine as I've never had a chance to try it. However I was quite disappointed that it didn't have enough cheese curds and the fries were quite soggy. Next time I will try their breakfast menu or stick to their sandwiches. 

The plus side about this place is the bottled coke as it is rare to see these nowadays."}
{"text":"The smoked meat in my experience is by far the best in Toronto, not on the level of Schwartz's or Carnegie Deli but the closest you'll get in Toronto. Haven't explored much of the menu outside of the fresser, black cherry soda and occasionally fries. Also has a decent selection of local beers on tap ."}
{"text":"I'm not terribly well versed in deli meats or Jewish food. I've heard great things and decided to go. I tried what seemed like the least Jewish sandwich, the BBQ brisket. It was delish. It was so big, I took home half. I also got an order of fries which were really good. I'd go back for the fries or in the event my taste buds become a bit more brave."}
{"text":"Party too hard last night? Caplansky's smoked-meat sandwich is the cure.

After a late night of birthday celebrations, I headed to Caplansky's with some friends the next day to soothe our ailing heads and hungry stomaches. We could not have chosen a better spot! I started with the matzah ball soup - which was both soothing and delicious - and then we all chowed down on smoked-meat sandwiches! Soft bread, over-loaded with juicy, flavourful smoked meat, and finished with a crunchy pickle! Absolutely love this place - next time, I'll have to leave room for those pies and cakes in the case that always look so decadent!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal here thoroughly. We ran into this new Yorkville location almost by accident, and due to time constraints, opted for this location over the more established classic.

The beef sandwich here was good, Real Good. Tender and satisfying. Not cheap at north of $10 but I felt like I was eating something of real quality and substance. Shareable too if you are in for a lighter lunch.

We also enjoyed the basic breakfast bagel (great value at $5), matzo ball soup (free with sandwich), and pickle bar. And the pickle wallpaper.

Would definitely visit again. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came for the smoked meat.  Had a smoked meat sandwich and the smoked meat poutine.  Walking in, the smell of the smoke just hits you over the head.  A good sign.  Unfortunately, the smokey aroma didn't translate to the food.  The sandwich was pretty indistinguishable from a regular corned beef sandwich.  Where's the smoke, man?!  Despite the lack of smokey flavor, the meat was still tasty and it was a pretty good sandwich.

The smoked meat poutine was kind of like a chili cheese fries.  The fries themselves were below average.  Small, limp, greasy.  The smoked meat was all ground into the gravy to make a chili like slurry.  The cheese curds were melted to the point that they were not identifiable as curds."}
{"text":"This place is a little over-hyped but it's still a damn good place for a sandwich and some classic deli fare.

My first visit was in the winter on a weekend during brunch hours. It was pretty busy but we were somewhat seated quickly. I had the smoked meat sandwich after hearing so many great things, and my lunchmate made the poor choice of getting the hot turkey sandwich. We also had the matzo ball soup and blueberry blintzes to share. My smoked meat sandwich was unfortunately not the best smoked meat I've had in Toronto. That title belongs to Yitz's up in midtown, but it's a pain to get up there. And then there's Schwartz's in Montreal...However, it was still tasty and still very good. The hot turkey sandwich, however, was a complete bomb. It was bland white turkey meat with no seasoning on plain white bread, with no mayo, mustard, or anything...nothing! The turkey itself was okay, but it was just kind of a joke that they would serve that. The matzo ball was great and perfect for a cold winter day, but the blintzes also fell a little flat and were very bland even with the blueberry sauce.

Despite the mostly average food, this place still gets a 4/5 stars because I just had such a nice time there. The place is buzzing with chatty diners, and you can see Zane poke his head out from the kitchen to say hello and check on the regulars. Service wasn't memorable, but that also means there no complaints. It's a fun place to be and for what it's worth, the food (at least my sandwich) was pretty satisfying. It's been a while but I'd love to go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"An amazing authentic jewish styled deli in Toronto. Located steps away from Kensington Market, it makes for a perfect brunch place. A friend and I came here and grabbed some smoked meat sandwiches. Had the Ruben, tasted delicious. Had the fries and a side of lotke, which are hashbrows. You can either get a side of fries or lotke, but if you go with a date/friend, you can ask them to split it ;) (tip). My friend has the grilled tongue sandwich, now it doesn't sound appetizing, but I urge you it is the most delicious tasting sandwhich on the menu! It's the consistency of soft corned beef and it tastes delicious. Wonderful place, great service and a delightful patio. Pet friendly as well. They offer your dog a bowl and water. The fries are a bit stringy, but taste great. The quality of the meat is what they are known for. Unlimited mustard and a variety of hot, German, Dijon and yellow are available at the table. I would recommend this place for any sandwich lover. 5/5"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by stating that I got a salad with the smoked turkey so I didn't have the full on deli sandwich experience. That stated, the meat was underwhelming. It wasn't very flavorful and a bit dry. The Greek salad was huge but over dressed. The condiment bar was top notch with lots of peppers!"}
{"text":"They should call their specialty sandwich \"smoked fat\" instead of smoked meat.

A bit on the pricy side to be spewing out chunky, stringy pieces of fat every other bite.

The smokey smell and taste is delicious when you do actually get some meat. 

The sandwich comes with nothing on it. There's a pickle on the side. If you're getting it to go, it's good to use one of their fancy mustards (instead of the regular yellow mustard that comes with it).

The girls working there were really friendly. The kitchen is slow. How long does it take to make a sandwich? Apparently 15 minutes. 

The guy who appeared to be a manager had a somewhat sarcastic and socially awkward sense of humour. His approach towards customers and his employees seems a bit off but he means well, it seems. He realized that I was waiting for a while and was on top of it, which I appreciated. He was friendly.

It would be nice if the bread was toasted instead of soggy, and if they made the sandwich with the pickle in it. I'm sure you could ask for it that way though.

Overall, pretty decent, but I'm in no rush to go there again."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the weather is cooling down because boy, does it get stuffy in the bright blue room during the summer time! Regardless, there is a pretty consistent line up out the door during peak meal times year round. I find myself pretty surprised that it's always so busy. Maybe this is because despite the fact that I've been to Caplansky's several times, it's only been for brunch. If you think that their smoked meat is good, let me tell ya, their beef bacon is amazing. 

While everything is usually quite enjoyable, Caplansky's has also given me a fair share to complain about. I've found shells in my scrambled eggs, gotten served almost char-like latkes, and have generally been put through extremely long waits for everything from food arriving to coffee refills and settling the bill. Instead of reacting with much surprise or apology whenever things go wrong though, they've always just moved on very casually. For example, in a recent instance when we were accidentally served a second poutine instead of our mains after almost a half hour's wait, the server just shrugged and left us the dish as a bonus. In our hungry state, we ate almost the entirety of the second poutine before our meals finally arrived.

With that said, the service is consistently friendly (although sometimes hurried) and there is something about that honest and inviting shade of blue that just keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"The smoked meats are great... other dishes are hit and miss.  

The service is all over the place... one week we had the worst server we have ever experienced, the next visit, one of the best servers - especially since he was the only server, with just some help with clearing tables.

I guess that is why the motto on their menu is:  \"Same great food, same lousy service.\"  

If the service was more consistent I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"For Toronto downtown core at least, there's not a large selection of Jewish deli style places to choose from. This place sure does hit the spot though if that's what your craving. 

I've been coming here every couple months for the past few years, and really narrowed it down to one main thing I like here - The pickled tongue! Everything is else is just noise to me. Honourable mention might go to the corn beef hash, maybe a latka, but I could seriously just order a plate of the delicious tongue, and a side of pickles. The meat is just so tender, and incredibly rich to taste. Gotta love the homemade mustards as well, it's a must for any sandwich. 

Still a 3 star, only because some \"go to\" dishes that should be clutch are pretty average. Chopped Liver/Matzah ball soup in particular can be found else where for better."}
{"text":"Sometime last August, I walked into the lunchroom at work. One of my co-op students cheerfully said good morning to me and asked whether I'd be interested in using her CityPass coupons that she hadn't used. She advised that she hadn't used the Royal Ontario Museum one. I wanted to visit it and said yes to that coupon. 

I quickly booked the next day off from work. I had a fantastic time. I had worked up an appetite and came to Caplansky's for a late lunch. 

This place is located in the heart of Yorkville. You need to climb up a set of stairs to get into the restaurant. 

I was promoted greeted by someone who helped me out with my order. I did the rubenesque sandwich combo, which came with matzo ball soup with dill, chips, and a fountain drink. You can get refills for the latter. 

The woman apologized that the fountain drink machine didn't work. She got me a Diet Coke in a can while she fixed the machine. 

You can sit either upstairs or downstairs. I was thinking that if you have mobility issues, this restaurant isn't for you. 

I loved the matzo ball soup with dill. I have a weakness for dill. It was filling and yummy. 

The rubenesque sandwich was good  The sauce made the toasted bread soggy. It also tasted greasy, but that could be me. The chips were fine. 

There were plenty of flies wanting to enjoy my food while I was downstairs. I was watching the Olympic games on the projector. It was difficult to hear what was going in. There seemed to be a meeting between the owner of the restaurant and two guys in suits. 

My boyfriend called me on the phone, so it was nice to chat with him while I was eating alone. I had earbuds in. 

Service was prompt, but asking how each item that I was eating was became a bit much. Still, I appreciated being checked in than being completely ignored. 

Washrooms are upstairs. The fountain drink machine worked by the time that I was leaving the restaurant, so I filled up my cup and left.

{"text":"I had a smoked meat sandwich with latkes which were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. 

The sandwich, which was ordered fatty was actually a little dry which is strange, but that could be attributed to the late hour perhaps.

I would say that the quality was not as good as what I remember from my first visit, several years ago.  There were a few cleanliness issues in the dining room as well which I hope can be improved in the future."}
{"text":"Omg smells so drool worthy when you walk in.  The waitress was super friendly and high energy. Sad news we came for the knish and they were out so we tried a few other items.  The smoked meat sandwich was tender and so flavorful, no mustard needed.  However they have several great tasting mustards available.  Bit underwhelmed by the maple bacon donuts but the poutine, smoked meat & Ruben sandwiches were all delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived just after the lunch rush on Tuesday.... Greeted and seated immediately.... Checked the menu and ordered Reubenesque and side order of Fries with a glass of water.... Water came first, bottle of tap water with a clear plastic glass.... Sandwich and Fries arrived pdq... Sandwich came with 1/4 pickle ( excellent ) and chips...Glad I ordered the side, as the sandwich would not have fulfilled my needs by itself... Meat was clumped in the middle of the bread, none at the edges.... Asked for the Fries to be well done and they were cooked perfectly.... Cant get over the $13.95 for the sandwich.... Too little to be that expensive.... Servers were great.... Will most likely return when in the area but will not have the Reubenesque unless it is discounted..."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with my meal, just tasted...bland. service was fine, food was serverd a little too quickly for my liking. Overall I just wasn't impressed with my meal, smoked meat mash shouldn't be that hard to put together its easy to add taste. Had high hopes for this place"}
{"text":"What a great meal :) 
The menu has the deli classics and the food is delicious, fairly generous, fresh, hot... satisfying all around. 
I recommend the kishka- drool. The smoked meat is exactly how it should be and all of the extras were well done too- crunchy pickles, AMAZING mustards... decent fries, fresh rye bread etc. 
The service was attentive- I had my coffee refilled about 4 times and dishes were removed promptly. 
It is clean and casual- a good place to take family. 
It may only be a few years old but it already feels like an institution."}
{"text":"Caplanskys poses a conflict of interest. I'm supposed to think about things like food, service and value. My opinion of the ownership really shouldn't enter into the picture, unless said owner acts in such a way to enhance or detract from the experience. 

It's tough to maintain that level of objectivity at Caplanskys, because Zane is just so damned likable. 

So here is my disclaimer: I consider Zane Caplanskys at least an acquaintance, and if our schedules were more compatible, I'd probably consider him a friend. The dude has earned my respect by choosing what he wants to do with his life, and going after it no matter what people think. He has breathed life into a style of food that's perilously close to extinction, and attracted a diverse clientele, from the hippest hipster to the crankiest Zoom, they pile into his shop on College to gorge on food that we all enjoyed before eating became a pale exercise in health. 

The food varies from the sublime to the ridiculous, which is why I can't quite give the place full marks. 

Soups are always good. The matzo ball version features proper chicken stock and a large, fluffy dumpling. Pea soup and beet borscht are peppered with chunks of house-smoked brisket. They are deeply flavored, but texturally inconsistent, watery on one visit and fork-worthy on another. Either way, they taste great, and as a home cook I'm used to those kinds of variations. In a restaurant, I'd like to know what I'm getting. Knishes are outstanding. Crispy pastry stuffed with more beef, onions rendered in chicken fat and well-seasoned mashed potatoes. They come with a side of gravy, which itself is available with more smoked meat. It's delicious, but I prefer spicy deli mustard with mine-new york stylee. Kishke, a Jewish sausage, is roasted until it's skin is crispy. It also arrives with gravy. For the record, so do the excellent french fries if you poutinize them by adding said gravy and cheese curds. I've had the fries on their own and in cardiac event form. They're great either way. 

The meat itself is hit and miss. When it is good, it's deliciously salty-buttery-smokey, served on sturdy Silverstein's rye. Hot mustard cuts through these heavy flavours, as does coleslaw in vinaigrette. When it's bad, it's the same mediocre deli you get elsewhere in the city. 

Brunch is an event. Strong coffee precedes an array of breakfast choices, including build-your-own omelet. Zane challenges us to use anything on the menu. Two ideas for enterprising Yelpers: 

1) An egg salad omelet 
2) A kishke and fried onion omelet. 

So far, I've tried neither. Go for it, and please report back. 

Dinner selections are less successful. Maple-drenched fried chicken sounds great, and arrives as a substantial portion. Grilled veg are surprisingly good. The chicken reminds one of Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". It's beautiful on the outside, but inedibly raw on the inside. The server notices immediately, and takes it away. I'm offered anything on the menu, so I try my luck with a smoked meat sandwich. It's on the tough side, and the fat has turned more rubbery than buttery. Not a great night all the way around for the kitchen, but my meal is comped and the service is excellent. That's why I keep coming back. 

Non-deli options are also available. Like ratatouille, which I'm sure would taste great, if only I could stop laughing at the prospect of going to a deli for ratatouille. I respect my vegetarian friends' life choices. I go meatless frequently. I'm not going to a deli to do so. 

I take pride in the coffee at Caplanskys, which is a few steps above some of the 'finer' restaurants in the city. It is robust and served in deli-proper small ceramic mugs. Refills are readily offered and readily consumed. Desserts were a highlight when they were made in-house. I swear their chocolate cake came from my mom's recipe. Now, they bring most of it in. The suppliers are fine, but there's nothing like home baking. 

A weekly storytelling evening is worth lingering at over pints of fresh draught, or coffee with cake. 

 I come for the food. I stay for the schmooze."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been lied to with the Caplansky's name attached to this 'restaurant' in Terminal 3.  I arrived way too early for a 7 am flight and after dealing with security, I was desperate for food and coffee.  I wasn't as familiar with T3 as most the time I fly out of T1.  The name Caplansky's is the first restaurant in the hallway as I walk towards my gate and I figure it couldn't be that far off from the real deal.  WRONG.

I'm not even sure how to describe adequately my experience without being very negative.  If the food was remotely close to the Toronto restaurant, I'd be willing to overlook the service blunders but I just... can't.  We ordered a simple egg breakfast.  The first issue was the wait staff wouldn't look anyone in the eye or acknowledge the order.  We had no clue if he heard us at all.  The 2nd issue was that the person at the cashier had a lot of problems with the till and basic math. I'm not sure if he was missing a coffee to jump start the thinking process but it was so painful to correct him that I didn't get the right change to make $5.  He insisted that 1 toonie and 2 loonie is $5.  

The food was just as bad as my memories of liquid eggs in high school breakfast.  It was rubbery and tasteless... it also cost me the same amount as 2 breakfasts at a Tim Hortens.  

Next time I'm in T3, I'm just heading 5 minutes further towards the end of the hallway where they have the new restaurants opened up.  They dont have a branding like Caplansky's but they at least look like they're serving real food."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place... 3 stars for now with a personal promise to go back and give this place another chance.  Especially since I didn't even try the famous smoked meat  (It's Friday, planning to have Stockyards tonight and I didn't want to get meated-out).

I went there as part of a stroller caravan; three new moms with sleeping babes in tow.  We were put off at first because we were told that we couldn't be accommodated on the patio (at least five empty tables) and to go inside, only to see that the inside had far less space.  The owner (we ass-u-me'd was the manager) Zane, who was inside, took us back out and we got a great table by the patio side entrance that had more than enough room for our brigade.  

I ordered the LEO, enticed by the promise of shmaltz fried onions, eggs, lox and latkes.  But the latkes were disappointingly small, like timbit sized.  The eggs with lox were lovely, but the rye toast was fine but nothing special.  Yeah I was still hungry after.

One of my lunch partners had the meat hash, which I sampled and liked but maybe not enough to order.  Using the word 'leftovers' in the menu description is a bit unappetizing.  (Take Chinese fried rice for example, it's made with leftovers - or at least it should be - but we'd never describe it that way on the menu would we?  Oops did I just let out a secret?)"}
{"text":"For what I paid I expected a little more. Service was fine and food was tasty but my is this place pricey! My little smoked meat sandwich + side of fries came up to about $15. Looking at the pictures on Yelp, I think I got short changed. My sandwich was definitely smaller than any pictured here."}
{"text":"Looking for some comfort food and definitely found it here. Deep fried pickles and the rubenesque. The only thing I think I want is double meat for the rubenesque. I'm insatiable. Service was nice also."}
{"text":"Oh yes, I really enjoyed Caplansky's.  I had the smoked meat combo with smoked meat poutine for lunch.  Their smoked meat is the best I've had in Toronto.  Tender and medium fat is really medium fat, with a nice flavour.  Not too salty too!  Pickles are a bit disappointing, flaccid and boring, slaw was ok.  Lunch service was good.  Will come back for fatty smoked meat, and bbq brisket."}
{"text":"There are good reasons to like Caplansky. The smoked meat is pretty tasty. Also, Caplansky's is an honest to goodness Deli (with a hip vibe), which is a nice addition to a city which lacks delis. 

On the other hand, the placed does not compare to the likes of Schwartz's in Montreal or Kat'z in New York. For starters, the meat  sandwich is pretty small and at not cheap ($15 with a very small side salad). But my main complaint was that the meat was too smokey. I mean pucker your lips,  scratch the back of your throat kinda smokey.

Still, I would likely be back to Caplansky to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"A good deli is a good thing. Caplanskis is a bad deli. I hoped our first visit was a one off, food was slow and massively overpriced, mustard bar is a nice touch (hence the second star), but this place has failed the basic tests after two visits. Bread wasn't fresh, meat was poorly seasoned, menu is inflexible. The portions are tiny, especially at their ridiculous price point (they're in the same price range as the excellent plates of pasta around it in Yorkville). I figured the 20 minute wait could be excused on my first visit during lunch rush, when I waited 25 mins and was the only person in the restaurant I figured it was more systemic. 

I imagined that they had appeared on Dragon's Den, NOT as a last ditch effort, but for exposure. Turns out this place barely functions as a business, the staff is shamelessly unhelpful and the food is bad. 

This place tries to be iconic, selling swag and memorabilia, they haven't even proven they can function in a basic way. It irks me that they try to be like Schwartz' in that regard without doing the basics competently. 

If you have a hankering for smoked meat in this area, go to New York Deli on Bay."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome especially their condiment bar where you can help yourself to as many and as much sauces and pickled vegetables you want. I tried all their pickled vegetables because I'm obsessed with pickled thangs, and I had my first pickled tomato here (was great ). I had the rubenesque, and it was a lot smaller than I thought but it was delicious nonetheless. I had a greek salad with mine and it was alright, but I regret not getting fries or their potato pancakes. Expect to spend about $20+ when you eat here."}
{"text":"Wow, is this place all hype or what? I was stoked to visit for my first time today for some smoked meat. Oh boy my sammy was awful, thick cut and dry - Druxy's makes a better version and the Corned Beef House destroys this place. Adding further to my dissapointment - the sides are way overpriced! Unfortunately I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"First time I ate there, I dunno, was the usual guy sick or something?  The smoked meat on rye was hard and chewy and not so steamy.  The pickles were small, like Bick's Pickles size.  The beer gave me food poisoning. It was Millhouse Organic and a draft and I shouldn't have ordered it but I think they didn't clean the tubes when they switched kegs.  I gave it another shot a few weeks later, had the steak and eggs.  Serviceable but I've had better steak and eggs.  
Don't get me wrong but I love the 'vibe' of the place.  It's friendly and relaxing and the servers are so nice.  But the food for me was sketchy.

I'll give it another shot however...."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here. This is yet another place that used to be great until they were on tv then became a huge ripoff by jacking up prices and lowering the content dramatically. Tiniest pastrami sandwich I've ever had in my life. Funnier even that they have reviews posted on the wall with pictures of what their sandwiches used to look like. Ridiculously big difference trust me. Don't get me started on the awful poutine with no gravy and the hockey puck potatoes latkas which would be more at home at the air canada Centre. Honestly felt ripped off and you should avoid this place. Looking for another pastrami place now"}
{"text":"There was a hardened old lump of cheese on top of my poutine, obviously not fresh, unmelted. Horrible customer service. Eight ladies working there are none of them knows what's going on or how to work the machines, greet the customer, keep the kitchen area clean or make food. 

They have a corned beef sandwich for 10 bucks, or a smoked meat sandwich. I asked her what kind of smoked meat it was. She said beef. I asked her pastrami? She said... Blank stare. 

Got a poutine. Was tiny. The most disgusting poutine I've ever tasted. Salted mass of old ingredients and carelessly thrown into the crappy old plastic bowl. 

Don't. Waste. Your time. Or calories. After a long day of traveling... And you're so hungry... Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We visited Caplansky's while in town because we saw it in the documentary Deli Man and we wanted to support a family owned Jewish deli. We wanted very much to love it but can't really say we did. The place is super cute and the staff was incredible... No complaints there. But the food we ordered was not what we expected. The matzoh ball soup had too much pepper and just wasn't what we're used to. My husband had the Reuben sandwich and said it was just OK. My son ordered a bagel with cream cheese and lox and the bagel was really small. He didn't really care for the lox. My tuna sandwich was OK but it would have been better grilled. Desserts were tasty. I hope others will give it a try and order some other items... Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?"}
{"text":"Caplansky's was a big disappointment this evening.It was my birthday and I went with my husband & two grown sons after a movie.It was about 9pm so may have been close to closing time.The fressor sandwich was supposed to be a platter as my son had had it before, but we each got half a fressor(sandwich) on a saucer size plate. The meat was disgusting,thick, thick slices of tasteless meat and so dry, although we had ordered medium smoked meat. The fries were just so unappetizing,skinny, unappealing, & they almost looked burnt.The staff didn't seem to care & what we really should have done is walk out. And $15 for the fressor dish which is a tasteless meat sandwich on  a tiny piece of rye bread is outrageous.$5 for the fries is an outrage. I grew up in Montreal eating  inexpensive smoked meat sandwiches which MELT in your mouth This was a waste of time,money & gas

Stay away from Caplansky's if you are expecting decent prices and good smoked meat. You will be very disappointed as we were.Almost $50 for poor service & lousy food is just not worth it!"}
{"text":"UPDATE


So Caplansky's proves their inconsistency once again. My mom and I had breakfast here. She ordered scrambled eggs and toast, I had the Ruben. The Ruben was great but the eggs were dry as dust. I wouldn't serve these eggs to someone in my own home let along a restaurant. A few days later we ordered extra lean Rubens to go. When we got home we found that they were in fact extra fatty! We went back to request this mistake be fixed but were met with indifference and no compensation (like a new sandwich) was offered. So instead of apologizing for the mistake and offering to fix it they seem to have decided they take no responsibility for their food. Pretty absurd. The deep fried pickles still rock. 



original review 

Admittedly, I came to Caplansky's about 3 years ago and was very disappointed. I thought it was bland and way too expensive. Luckily I decided to come again and have been twice in the last two days to revisit their Ruben sandwich and deep fried pickles. The pickles are perfectly fried and just greasy enough, while \"the rubenesque\" was tasty and had just the right amount of crunch from the sauerkraut. I loved the mustard selection (hint: mix the Russian honey mustard with the super extra hot, yum!) 

I also love that you can order extra lean because I'm not a big fan of fatty Rubens

Both times service was friendly and attentive. Lots of smiles. Very happy o decided to try this place again."}
{"text":"The closing of their OG location is sad, but I'm so glad that they opened this location. The decor resembles a modern diner and they've implemented a pickle and mustard bar which I think is a great idea. The service is also great, but with the limited tables, I see this place getting pretty packed at peak times. 

The food is yummy as always, with smoked meat on rye being a classic. If you have a sweet tooth, I'd definitely recommend the leaning tower."}
{"text":"The leaning tower is to die for - layers of french toast with cream cheese and blueberry jam. Had the pulled pork too and the sandwich was enormous, I only managed to finish half."}
{"text":"Late night menu taster - 1 am

Smoked meat sandwich and poutine w/ more smoked meat. Poutine was so so, soggy fries and unmelted cheese curds that lay in a soupy  brown liquid at the bottom of the bowl. (later I came to realize this was the gravy)  

Sandwich was dry until I added this amazing honey mustard that was on the table. Meat was tender and the rye crust chewy, this I cannot complain about.The meal cap was a slice of chocolate cake. Errr for 6.95 it was not worth it.

Meal came to $38 for two. 2 out of 5 stars but an added extra star for attempting late night in this city. Service was so so."}
{"text":"Now Now...I know is unfair for me kept referring to Katz's Delicatessen no matter where I have my smoked meat experience...

Caplansky's Delicatessen is not Katz's... But is not bad!!

I love how there is a choice of lean/medium/fat for the smoked meat ... nice waiter suggest medium... that's when my Yelp buddy was in the washroom.. for him, he might have order the FAT!!

Smoked Meat Sandwich ($8)
- The size is great for snack...(yes snack) but great as lunch with one of the soup!
- The smoked meat itself I found it a little dry... not too juicy..but has a nice smokey flavour.. but did not Wow me...

Cabbage Borscht ($3.50)
- served hot!! like steaming hot!! 
- I found it hearty, and I love cabbage... and it have bit of smoked meat inside...Yes I love it! 
- I was surprised that it is a cup size, it is more a bowl size...(I got to finish off the rest while my yelp buddy busy eating his sandwiches!)

The service... here was surprisingly good!! Maybe I expect to have lousy services. 

The smoked meat sandwich though did take a long time to arrive... and the place was not even busy...."}
{"text":"The matzo ball is a special thing.  Some like 'em lite, others, like me, prefer them heavy.  

Caplansky's matzo ball soup broth is 100% real. Nothing from a can. Its as if someone cooked the perfect chicken, then, wrung it out into a bowl.

After talking about it with friends and other matzo ball fans, I've come to the conclusion that everyone will have their own opinion of \"the perfect\" ball.  

Caplansky's balls, (HAHAHAHA!) are small, light and fluffy.  Unlike many, they not too salty.  

OK - we've done the balls, lets talk about the meat. 

This is going to sound weird, but the first thing I though of when biting into Caplansky's meat sandwich was, bacon!  The flavour was heavenly.

The best Jewish deli in Toronto said Stas N. - and I agree 100%"}
{"text":"The matzoball soup is pretty tasteless. The kreplach were pretty small with a very high dough-to-meat ratio.

I'm not saying I wouldn't come back -- I might if I'm craving a real deli sandwich, or corned beef hash -- but I don't get the love for this place.

Service was *really* friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for the airport, friendly staff and timely. Yes, it is not as good as the downtown locations but it's still pretty great for the airport."}
{"text":"While the prices are not cheap, the meat is good. I have to be honest the only thing I come for is the smoked meat sandwich.  The meat is juicy and very flavourful. The sandwich consist of two small pieces of quality rye bread, a load of smoked meat, and a pickle that's it. They also have a nice selection of mustard to choose from. I thoroughly enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sandwich outside of new York City  . They also have a really good brisket. Love there pickles and slaw .There beer is really good too. Service isn't always the greatest. I don't find them overally friendly. But as long as they keep making great sandwiches I can get past the poor service."}
{"text":"I really WANT to like this place.  I do.  But I can't.

The staff are pleasant, but the smoked meat has NEVER really lived up to my expectations.

It's OK.  Fair.  Mediocre.  Meh.  And sometimes less than that.

On my most recent visit, I couldn't find fatty enough meat in their precut and plastic packaged offerings, so the guy was nice enough to cut me some fresh - but the grey chunk of meat that he pulled out seemed overly dark and brown and the most incredible thing about it, is right in the middle there was a 1 inch triangular section that looked like veins!  Several of them.  

I've never seen that (especially that obvious) in smoked meat before, and it was pretty large.  And very gross.

I thought to myself - well - that's the sort of thing you should take a knife to and cut out - but the guy just sliced right through it so EVERY piece of meat I got had these really gross little 'asshole' looking things in them.

And that wouldn't be so bad if the meat didn't taste 'off.'  It just wasn't quite right.  It did taste a little bit like ass.

Sorry Zane.  I'd like to love your food.  I just can't.  

It's like I keep thinking I'll be getting tasty, warm fatty smoked meat that I crave - and it's SO close - but never quite.  

I'm so disappointed.  Because it's almost good.  And I keep thinking next time will be great.  But it's not.


Oh - and on a funny note:  I just saw Caplansky's on the news, because it was shut down for almost a week by the building owner over some sort of dispute with Zane, and the news report showed a staff member writing on a chalk-board sign in front of the store as they reopened - and the tubby guy wrote:  \"When life hans you lemons ... drink lemonade.\"    (Maybe they should hire staff that knows how to spell 'hands.')   :)"}
{"text":"I've always thought that going for sammiches at restaurants was kind of weird, considering that I could make the same for less, but it was totally worth it this time even if it was a little pricy.

I got the sandwich combo with borscht, which was oddly sweet but contained delightful mini-cubes of falling-apart beef. The combo also came with a half-pickle and a couple bites of slaw, both of which were very average. The sandwich, which was cut in half, is a misnomer though. It would be more accurate to describe it as a small mountain of juicy, succulent, deliciously smoky meat between two too-small slices of light rye bread. I actually ended up eating it by eating the top slice of bread, the meat, and then the bottom slice of bread because there was no way I'd be able to get my mouth around the whole thing.

The waiter was very friendly and prompt, if frighteningly perky, and the place was very clean.

They also sell the meat in half-pound or one pound packages, and I ended up getting a pound to go."}
{"text":"This place makes me miss New York City.

The options here are reasonably legit. Yes, it's been turned into a chain, but that's how restaurants survive. I get that.

It helps me hold off a little bit on having to fly home for a good Jewish deli, but it doesn't quite feel like the real thing to me. Torontonians likely feel otherwise."}
{"text":"This place has the best poutine I have ever tasted--latke poutine. For breakfast I like to get the smoked meat hash with a coffee. This place has delicious sandwiches for lunch and they make their own mustards. They also have a number of sandwiches on challa bread-- which are so soft and rich. Make sure u visit this place."}
{"text":"I went over there at 1pm on a nice weekday afternoon to get a takeout sandwich, only to discover a short line up and busy restaurant.  It took the waitress (why was there not even a designated hostess?) 10 minutes to acknowledge the rapidly lengthening line, which was by then out the door.  No real waiting area.  I said that I wanted to order a sandwich to take out and she said it would be 15 minutes.  I think they need a better way to process take-out customers... maybe I should have called ahead.

Food e.g. Smoked Meat (when I can get it): 4 stars
Service / Efficiency: 2- stars
Average: 3 stars"}
{"text":"Love the cabbage borscht, it has a lovely sweet and sour taste, although last time it was a little heavy on the tomato. It's a great bargain at $4.50 a bowl. 
I find the potato salad has way too many onions for my taste and my  sensitive digestive system. Had the blueberry blintzes last time and wasn't impressed. Still nice atmosphere, quick service, no line ups."}
{"text":"After being rather dissatisfied with the one on college street I happen to be in Yorkville today shopping and give in the back it had an outdoor patio, and my dog with with me, I thought I try to again.


I went inside and ordered the classic Rubin with fries. Just to confirm I said \"your Ruben is made with pastrami,?\" \"Correct?\" \"They are the same thing.\" He said. Wrong.

I told him to knock on the window or bring it out as I was sitting with my dog. They brought it out dropped on the table and \"said mustard, ketchup, pickles?\" I said yes, he said \"it's inside.\" Sweet. There I was with my books out my bag Unpacked and my dog beside me.

The Ruben was adequate, although lacking in sauce making it a bit dry.

So, How the hell can you be a deli and not make good french fries? And the fries were likely twice deep-fried and were served medium warm and soggy-in fact they didn't have enough stamina to even be considered anything other than limp. And face it limp fries are kind a like a limp dick, you might as well tell the dude to keep it  as you certainly can't  you can't do anything satisfying with it!

So I'm totally convinced this Caplansky's deli thing is all hype and no substance."}
{"text":"I dropped in for lunch for the first time last week. I ordered a Reuben with egg bred and extra slice of cheese. No beverages no dessert, came to 20 bucks for a sandwich.

Sandwich was good but nothing to write home about, and definitely nothing to write home to your Jewish mom about!

Service was friendly. 

At $20 for a sandwich I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good spot for a hangover cure brunch on the weekend. Portions are good, but overall a bit pricey for the service and food quality. The smoked meat scrambled eggs and potato latkes are a must."}
{"text":"Was in town earlier in the fall and came across Caplanskys.    I got the Latkes with Apple Sauce. Saw the other menu items but was not  too impressed with the variety  +  I have already had smoked  meat sandwiches in Montreal. If  I am in the town again and am craving some Latkes  then I will surely order some. Make  a trip to Caplanskys and treat yourself to some Latkes."}
{"text":"When I travel, there are a few things I seek out intentionally: a hotel where I will accumulate massive rewards points, a good cup of coffee, a well-stocked book store, and a deli. Why a deli? Why not?!? Deli food is so very yummy and, in Canada, there is the added bonus of the smoked meat competition between Toronto and Montreal, which you are going to want to get involved in. I did and I have no regrets.

In my recent trip to Toronto, my last stop before my flight was Caplansky's because what's better than smoked meat before being trapped in a pressurized cabin? Nothing. Nothing is better.

We'll get to the smoked meat in a minute, but I can't talk about any deli without noting the RYE. My husband is absolutely obsessed with seedless rye. It is his first question in any deli and the answer will determine the entire outcome of a meal. If there ARE seeds, there is a five minute breakdown of NYC delis getting it right and the entire structure of a Reuben or smoked meat sandwich being compromised. My husband's deli needs are vast and have rubbed off on me, but -really- the rye should be considered first. Caplansky's rye was very fresh and had a little crunch to it. A good start.

Although there is a fair amount of tension (Canadian tension, which is like American sleeping) between Montreal and Toronto's delis over their smoked meat, the sandwich itself is called a \"Montreal-style hot smoked meat sandwich\". So, I guess someone won the copyright.

Caplansky's sandwich combo comes with a HUGE basket of fries. Fries are great, but what makes for a good meat sandwich? Well, I just explained it. It is a MEAT SANDWICH, people. If it is a little fatty, that just makes it juicer and better. This is a large sized sandwich that is filled with meat. My explanation is over and quite thorough, I think.

Yes, the food is good, but the music is good, too. I walked into Caplansky's as \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" playing. Other Johnny Cash songs played the rest of the time, including \"Personal Jesus\". I found The Man in Black to be a nice choice for smoked meat consumption, like a nice wine pairing.

Now, condiments. Condiments in a deli are vitally important.  Dressings with zip, special sauces with ingredients that aren't written down, sandwich spreads crafted by the owner's grandmother, horseradish and wasabi smears that are used for childish bets- all are important and make locations unique. But, there is no condiment in a deli more important than mustard and Caplansky's will meet your needs. I promise.

Caplansky's has blue and white t-shirts coating the walls and quirky signs to keep your attention while you wait for the carver to do his job. While I was there, I saw an intense and loving conversation happening between a couple and what looked to be the owner. It added to the neighborhood/special feel of this place. (Also, there are beautiful lemon squares and cheese cake in the display case that will try to convince you not to overeat all of the meat and fries in front of you.)

Yes, I seek out delis when I travel... and, maybe, you should, too. Here is my final argument: MEAT SANDWICH. For me, that makes deli exploration a noble mission."}
{"text":"Smoked meat hash for brunch .... Amazing! Get that, or substitute the bacon for smoked meat in the $11 \"Special\" that includes the coffee (Ezra's Pound, $3 otherwise!)

Is it like Swartz's (in Montreal), i.e. the \"gold standard\"? No. The meat is leaner here and the seasoning is completely different. It's also pricier here, but the decor is much nicer than Schwartz's. You get your own table here, enough said.

Do you need to come here at least once if you're in Toronto? Naturally. I mean you're gonna walk around Kensington anyways, right?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their BBQ brisket sandwich. Delicious food and decent prices! The amount of fries they give you is bonkers! Try out the Spicy Mustard, it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"Finally conquered this place. Wandered here after hopping a streetcar frim Pride. Wan't too busy. Two boys and a ather aplit Mac n' Cheese...looked and smelled amazing. I got a Caplansky birger where beef and smoked meat combine into a patty on a challah bun to make your mouth water. Add cheddar and bacom, its $12 plus tip. I split it with my guy for his shoestring poutone ($11). My is it meaty and delicious! Good trade to try their other menu items. Of course we'll have the traditional smoked meat reuben from the food truck wen we see it next. Can't beat a Jewish Deli with history. $32 for two dine in on a Sunday evening, well worth the fill."}
{"text":"THE BEST Smoke Meat I have had in Years!!! Only surpassed by the service and deli d√©cor. The French fries were excellent, even though I prefer thicker ones these were very good. I ended the meal with an Apple Blossom, very tender and tasty. 
Being from Raleigh NC I make Caplansky's a stop every time I am in Toronto. 
Keep up the good food!"}
{"text":"Ok food but terrible service. Waited nearly 20 minutes before being greeted by my server. Food took another 20 minutes after ordering , even though the table next to me ordered (the same thing) after I did and had theirs before mine. Food was merely ok but it in no way made up for the abhorrent service."}
{"text":"This place is crap. Over priced, dry meat, crappy fries, grumpy staff.  Nuff said ......GARBAGE!"}
{"text":"Terrible.. ! Very disappointed in how small the sandwich was for 12 dollars, not to mention the dry meat... Yuck!"}
{"text":"We went to Caplansky's as my father wanted to visit . He was anticipating a great smoked meat sandwich and unfortunately we were all  pretty disappointed... The Montreal sandwich was small and the Rubens were over sauced and the smoke meat was completely dried out.  We did enjoy the latkes' and knishes ordered as they were flavourful and tasted like something we would have at home..

However we had great attentive Service from a long time employee that made the experience a pleasant one.

Do not expect to be back.as the food was not very good and quite expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I decided to skip the smoked meat and choose the meatloaf sandwich (mostly because I'm not a fan of rye bread and that was pretty much the only other bready option). It was very tasty and my husband was actually kind of disappointed that he chose the smoked meat sandwich. To the smoked meat's credit, we were there at the end of the night so it's understandable that it wasn't incredibly fresh and juicy. 

My sandwich was huge, at least for me, a short, 115 lb. twenty-something, but it might be considered an hors d'oeurve to a giant man. Anyway, I had my second half of the sandwich wrapped up to take home and sadly left the restaurant empty-handed because I left the bag on the table. :("}
{"text":"Wow after seeing these reviews I fear I went on an off day- my experience though was not great .....the smoked meat was tasteless truly the worst I ever had.
I ended up eating the whole pickle and half the sandwich. HUGE let down"}
{"text":"Toronto knows its meat, lemmetellya.  Caplansky's Delicatessen is another Toronto establishment that serves up some amazing house smoked product.  And for under 10 bucks (impressive for the area) I got more food than I could handle.  The breakfast \"special\" is indeed just that.  The latkes and the smoked beef bacon were a highlight and the bagel n' lox was quite good as well.

If I were a more discerning yelper I'd probably withhold my judgement on Caplansky's until I had some lunch or dinner here as there are better breakfasts out there.  But for a delicatessen, this place is great.  You're saving a couple bucks but still getting lovingly tended to food made from top quality, fresh, local ingredients.

I always round up on my reviews."}
{"text":"I think this place is a 3.5/5 on the almighty star scale for me. I ain't no so-n-so, though, so I'll list them as a 4. Round up, basic grade 7 math, right?!

I like their smoked meat, and I like their creative uses of it. Admittedly, I miss Mel's 24 Hour Deli, but this place probably actually has better quality meat. Their creative uses include putting it in pretty much anything - their poutine, their knishes, their mac and cheese. I'm sure if you wanted a smoked meat beverage they could make it happen. Overall, they're a bit pricey but they help me get my smokey fix. 

Their interior is really clean and well branded with their bright blue and white. A little sterile seeming, but mostly friendly. They have a cute little side patio, too. 

MeAt ya there, friends. 

PEPPER POINTS: 1.) For having a free fries with purchase of sandwich Yelp Check in special. Respect. 2.) Look 'em up on twitter if that's your thing... the owner is pretty funny."}
{"text":"Well as a Montrealer I have come to the realization that I will never find a proper smoked meat sandwich outside of Montreal but that being said, Caplansky's did a decent job at fixing my craving. 
I will probably stick to the other Deli meals from now on as they have a great selection and everything is very good and well priced. Great restaurant for a quick good Deli meal"}
{"text":"How did I go so long without knowing about this place? 

The smoked meat is amazing - incredibly tender and sliced more thickly than you get in many \"delis\". The latkes - ok, I may be dreaming about those for years. Best latkes in the city, hands down. Smoked meatloaf was also fabulous. And they make their own mustards - these guys take Deli seriously, and it shows.

Loved the entire experience including truly incredible customer service. Will be visiting again and again and again."}
{"text":"pretty stoked to see this place in the airport! 
I got potato latkes with sour cream & applesauce, & a side Caesar salad (I'm going through a Caesar salad phase) and Jimmy got a burger. everything was great, including the service.  
one star off because service was a bit slow and unattentive - I had to flag the waitress down twice (once because they forgot my applesauce) and again because we had finished eating and needed our bill."}
{"text":"this location is more modern than the one on college, with a self-serving mustard and pickle station, which are pretty cool. However, it's smaller with a limited/express menu. Ordered smoked meat sandwich with side salad. Salad came within a reasonable time while the sandwich came 30min later. The server had forgotten about the it and moved on to other tables...I guess my suggestion is you might not wanna go there if you're in a rush...no complaints about food though.."}
{"text":"Love it. Pickle bar is awesome. All food is good, doesn't matter what you get, you just can't go wrong. The latkes are so good and the portions are big. Not many tables but for lunch I can always get one. Decor is simple and cute. The food is just so good. Not much else I can say except the 5 stars are well deserved."}
{"text":"This is the best smoked meat sandwich I've had in Toronto!  It was fantastic.  The best smoked meat sandwich I've ever had is at Schwartz's in Montreal, but Caplansky's I would have to say is right up there.

I got the soup and sandwich combo and got the soup of the day (I forget the name), which was creamy and delicious.  I also tried some of the poutine and the fried pickles, both of which were decent but not amazing.  But man, the smoked meat sandwich really blew me away.  I'll definitely be going back to Caplansky's in the very near future."}
{"text":"Two stars at best...ordered two smoked meat sandwiches with fries...smoked meat was not as stacked as expected...it was dry and too lean. Not fun. Dark lager King Beer was good...basket of fries were a lot...one is enough for two diners...service was good...patio was available. Does not compare to Swartz in Montreal...Caplanskis is not even close...very disappointed"}
