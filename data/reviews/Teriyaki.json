{"text":"I have been visiting this place for the past few months due to my work relocation. I go here several times a week during the lunch time and grab my favourite dish Chicken and Beef Teriyaki. It comes with veggies, chicken, beef and rice. Because I'm a veggie junkie I always ask for more veggies than rice. The meal is prepared right in front of your eyes and the ingredients are fresh. I also tried their Hot and Spicy Chicken with noodles. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be and it came with a more variety of veggies (onions, bean sprouts, red and green peppers). I also found the employees to be friendly the food quality is always great. I visited other Teriyaki locations before I relocated here to Mississauga and I like this place the most. Will visit the place soon again!"}
{"text":"So terrible I sought out this website to warn others off! I ordered take-out Kung Pao Chicken and got a soupy mess, with a handful of burnt chilis thrown on top destroying any flavor? with spicy burnt chili flavor.  Inedible disgusting food I would not serve my worst enemy.  The deliver person was very friendly and the food showed up quickly but I would've been better off licking the crud off the bottom of my refrigerator.  Not Japanese.  Not even Asian.  Dis. Gust. Ting.  Also my soda was completely flat and my egg rolls had no taste at all but burnt brown things on the wrapper and some sort of mystery meat inside - and not in a tasty chinese-food mystery meat kind of way - a tasteless, has anyone seen the cat? type mystery meat"}
{"text":"Tried out Teriyaki III at there new location. 2585 E. Flamingo Rd. Suite 16, Las Vegas NV, 89121.

Had the teriyaki chicken bowl with Brown rice.   It did not dissapoint, the sauce wasn't too sweet and the brown rice was moist.   Great Service as well.

My only grip is that there new location only has two tables inside for diners.  From what I can figure out, it's because there is no public bathroom for customers so there's a limitation on In-house dining."}
{"text":"My husband n I  went d other day it smelled like sewer. D food some was good n d other not that good :)"}
{"text":"This place is quite busy in weekdays for grab and go, due to being near a lot of work buildings. The food is decent and healthy given the choice in the surroundings.

The food comes with veggies, rice and chicken, beef (if you got the meat in your meal). you can get more veggies just let them know. 

The staff is super friendly and funny and fast at the cooking. Plus they are clean.

For people who do not eat pork, there is no pork on the menu so its not being cooked  on the grill. 

ALL IN ALL its a food chain so no high expectations and its good for quick lunch in office hours."}
{"text":"Went with my spouse today to use a Groupon Now voucher we got. I'm a vegetarian and ordered the House Special To Fu and crab ragoon (which doesn't actually contain crab), and my spouse got the orange chicken.

Both came with fried rice, which was delicious. The tofu I ordered was really good, and I loved all the veggies and sauce that came with it. My spouse enjoyed the orange chicken. The portions were huge, and an incredible deal for the price.

I see that a review below says that they only have two tables. This must have changed recently as they had ten tables and a sign pointing to the restroom in the back."}
{"text":"When I first started at my job, a co-worker of mine told me I should go pick him and myself up some teriyaki bowls form here.  He swore they were good.  I went around the corner and ordered, brought them back, opened my bowl and stared in horror at what lay before me.  Various pieces of chicken - none of them identifiable as pieces of chicken.  It was mostly fat.  They were encased in a sticky, thick almost black sauce that I'm sure at one point may have resembled teriyaki before it was boiled down for hours.  I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites, and I'll eat almost anything.  

I stared in even more horror as my co-worker devoured every bit.  I guess some people like this place.  Definitely not me."}
{"text":"Worst mongolian beef, beef broccoli, lo mein, white rice & fried rice, teriyaki chicken, ever. DO NOT EAT HERE. The food is ROTTEN. They douse it with so much sauce to hide it. I thought I was gonna die that day. I only found out the food was rotten when bit half a large piece and then forced myself to vomit to prevent my death lmao.

The fried rice and white rice have obviously been in a fridge in that same takeout box for at least 2-3 weeks and they still served it!? It was so gummy and stunk horribly when I slid the food onto a plate!!!

What a disgrace to Asian cuisine! How dare they! Freaking pathetic."}
{"text":"The good
It was fast & low priced

The not so good...
The food was ok, not bad just avg.

Final thought
 If you want ur quick teriyaki fix especially late on the east side of town this is the place (the only place lmao)"}
{"text":"Its one of the best places i've been, if you go, order number 85 spicy.  its beef and broccoli, i recommended."}
{"text":"No need to review this fast food chain in detail -- but it generally is one of the more healthier choices out there.  Unfortunately this location is *extremely* chincey on both the vegetables and the meat.  More so than any other location I've been to."}
{"text":"I love the franchise and I've been eating at this particular one for years :) This one is the best in town in terms of portion size (they don't skimp like some of the T.E.s I've been to do). They really make it taste good at this one; little things like cooking your noodles on the grill to give it flavor as opposed to just dumping your meat on top of plain noodles. The staff is always friendly and polite and the facilities are always nice and clean. They are situated in the middle of a lot of different office buildings though, so if you come during lunch, expect it to be busy."}
{"text":"I don`t know where to start..with the horrible customer service or the horrible food. My colleague and I decided to get some hot and spice chicken with some noodles for lunch. We were greeted with a very confused worker who we had to repeat our very simple ``Two hot and spicy chicken on noodles to go`` FOUR times to and still got the order wrong. Within the first few bites we could tell the chicken was off with both of our meals. Not only was the chicken under cooked but the taste was awful, it tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. We called them to tell them we are coming back to get a refund. Once we arrived, one of the ladies tastes the chicken we had gotten and thought it was fine and would not give us our money back. We had to reiterate several times that it was not thoroughly cooked and the taste was gag worthy. She went ahead and called the owner to figure out what to do. In the  mean time, another lady literally was in a screaming match with my colleague about how we would not get our money back. Ultimately, a much nicer gentleman gave our money back after some back and forth. Before we left she made sure to inform us that she `would remember us`` and we told her we were never coming back. The first rule in customer service is don`t piss your customers off. Even if they had made a mistake of serving us awful food, they could have still saved it by offering some sort of incentive and weren`t so rude. Needless to say, we will never go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad for a strip mall restaurant - visiting family in town that are on that side of town.  Talk about cheap food - we tried the combo meal combo chow mein and the saipan noodle soup - enjoyed it a lot.  the inside is so different from the last review - anyways - enjoyed it - the food is freshly cooked - will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.. I'm a big fan of the teriyaki franchise... The RICE was stale... you could tell by texture and taste it's been sitting there for a couple of days .. rice had a plastic texture to it"}
{"text":"When I first new to the area, I came here thinking it'd be decent during the lunch hour.  How bad can simple noodles, tofu, and vegetables be?  As you can see from my rating, it was pretty bad.  I agree with the previous reviewer that this place is one of the WORST stores of the branding.  I've been to a few of them downtown Toronto near the Financial district and they were passable.  This place made me coin the phrase 'Terribly Yucki' for this place.

The eating area is fairly big and pretty clean.  There was about half the tables filled with people eating so that's a good sign right?  There was no line up so I ordered and then became quite startled with what I saw.  I asked for the tofu and vegetables with udon noodles.  The udon noodles were so old they just landed onto the griddle in a brick.  The 'vegetables' consisted of a FEW shredded white cabbage and bean sprouts.  You know, the cheap free stuff they give you at the super cheap Vietnamese Pho places.  I looked up at the picture and there was tons of colourful vegetables (peas, broccoli, beans, carrots, red peppers.... not filler!).  I asked them where was the vegetable and they pointed to the quarter cup of white veggies and I asked them why the picture was different... all I got was a shrug.  O...k...  I also asked for tofu and all I got was 5 slivers.  It was pretty pathetic.  

This all rang up to $7 for a plate of mostly old udon noodles and brown gooey sauce.  So Terribly Yucki... methinks not!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken Teri bowl for $3.79. I thought is was absolutely amazing! The rice was moist and fresh! The chicken was  moist and had the right amount of sauce. It also had steamed veggies of cabbage, carrot, and broccoli. They were slightly steamed which was great. The veggies were fresh and not wilted. I really thought that I should have been charged more for the food. Will definitely be back for more!"}
