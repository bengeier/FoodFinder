{"text":"CLOSED. There is a new restaurant at this location: Daawat Indian Cuisine Biryani House"}
{"text":"This place is under new management. I was excited when I found this gem on yelp.  

Food: The burger was really good. Huge portions and great quality for a low price. The humus was perfect, like nothing I have ever tasted.  I'm excited to try the gyro.  

Service: The service was really high quality. The owner was super friendly and the cook in the back seemed legitimately interested in my order and also seemed to enjoy his work. They were so generous and welcoming.

I also hear they deliver.  That's awesome for a burger better than 5 guys, in n out, culvers, etc.  Can you imagine having gyros delivered to your front door?  The menu is exciting and I can't wait to try everything.

Try this place for yourself.  I will be back... very soon."}
