{"text":"Amazing barbecue sauce and dry rub! Both are packaged very nicely and taste great with anything. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely good bbq.. love the Cajun bbq sauce.  The \"hot slaw\" was tangy and had the right amount of heat to it.. loved it.    The name is no doubt catchy and hard to forget.  Way to go 412 BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Found him at the Forest Hills Farmers Market. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I recently bought a bottle of the Golden BBQ Sauce and found it a zestfully tangy treat for your taste buds.  Whether it's on a burger, wings, meatballs or just as side, you won't be disappointed.  I demolished my bottle in a couple days and you will too.  Go get some.  Get it now.  Not later.  Now!"}
