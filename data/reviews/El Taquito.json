{"text":"Great little taco place! Close to home ...wish they had crispy beef. Meat and cheese plate is so good it has a specific name but I can't remember what its called right now"}
{"text":"A very cozy Mexican restaurant! Bright coloured interior & colourful dishes that catches the eyes while eating   Affordable prices, we ordered 2 taco chorizo's for $2.50 per taco. It tasted astronomical but was a tad bit spicy for my liking but all in all tastes delicious! We also ordered beef steak mix which came w/ 6 taco tortilla & filled us up real nice. We paired our taco dinner w/ their fruity drinks such as the pineapple & mango & was a great combination.  The restaurant also had a nice spanish touch to it while eating dinner we were entertained by the telenovela that was on the television. Overall, it was a great experience & now that I've discovered this place, I will no longer travel to great lengths for Mexican food when this place is just close proximity to my bfs place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"First time at this rest. and there was a cockroach on the wall and there tacos weren't even good.  -_-"}
{"text":"One of the legit taco places in Toronto. We ordered the chorizo tacos, beef head taco and the brisket taco. All of them were amazing~! they were served with a side of lime guacomole and hot sauce; that's actually hot. Tacos are also served on corn tortilla with cilantro and onions- which made it legit.   For $2.50 per taco, it's a bit pricy for what it is, but that's the usual going rate for mexican food in Toronto anyways. We aren't in socal or mexico, where it's 50 cents per taco.   Overall, my gf and I will be coming back here for more. It's on Jane and Lawrence, not really my type of area- but it'll do."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple: some of the better tacos I have had in Toronto. Definitely better than the fare found in Kennsington. If my memory serves me right, I think that it is better and definitely cheaper than Tacos El Asador.   Details. Tacos are $2.00-$3:50 each. We tried the Chorizo, Al Pastor, and Pollo. All were very very good. The Chorizo came with pineapple which, while unexpected, was an excellent pairing. They also have Tortas in the $6.00 neighborhood.   It's a simple-simon place: 4 or so tables. The meat is cooked after you order so the tacos took about 7-8 minutes to come out. The waitress was really sweet.  It's a little off the beaten path but if you're there, give them a try. If they were in the Dufferin-St. Clair-Yonge area, I would not be the first one reviewing them.  Only complaints: the limes were not that fresh and (in a perfect world) they should stock horchata. The meat was *slightly* skimpy but no more so than any other place in Toronto. I'm kind of a taco-burrito snob (Nor-Cal) so they only get 3 stars but I think that is actually pretty good for Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow... Eating here was a horrendous experience. First off, we attempted to order veggie burritos and tortas and neither of them were available. So we ended up ordering two sopas, an order of nachos and horchada.  The horchada was nasty. It was thick and chalky. The nachos were stale and disgusting. The sopas were so hard we couldnt cut it. We were also only given a plastic fork and knife. We tried eating it with our hands and true to form they were disgusting as well.   They also doused everything with a nastly avacado sauce which they called salsa verde!!  If the food wasn't bad enough, they have chairs that look like dollar store chairs which we almost fell off of twice.   We weren't able to get more than a few bites down and had to share our displeasure about the food with the three ladies that run the place.   They flipped out and started talking about us in Spanish.   In conclusion: horrible food, terrible service, awful ambiance!!!  This place should be shut down."}
