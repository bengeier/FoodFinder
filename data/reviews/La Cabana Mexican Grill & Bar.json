{"text":"I don't know what these other yelpers are complaining about! I had a fantastic experience here. Service was great and the food was even better. Ive been to Mexico and la cabana serves authentic Mexican food. Oh and you cant miss the drink specials;)"}
{"text":"I went for lunch at La Cabana with some friends and we really enjoyed our experience. I'm half Mexican and I've to say that I enjoyed not only the atmosphere but the wait staff and the bartender were really great.  I ordered the Taco, Enchilada and Tostada combo, with an order of rice. The chicken taco (as all my items were chicken) was delicious! The enchilada was full of chicken as was the tostada. The rice was perfect for me. The taste was authentic and tasted just like my family makes.  My friends and I definitely enjoyed our time at La Cabana and can't wait to head back to try the Fajita warming grills! What a great idea for a Friday GNO or just a big b-day party! Great to have a new Mexican restaurant in town that has more of a Taqueria feel and is welcoming. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had, and the service was terrible! The waitress came back 4 times to clarify our order. And the prices are high for Mexican food. This place won't be in business long."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about Mexican food and honestly I'm not a big fan of it, particularly the americanized versions that spend more time on their decor than their food. But this place is pretty awesome. Alot of their food is in the traditional style and authentic. I absolutely love their margaritas and their tacos and Carne Asada.  Their cocktail de camarone is my absolute fave! ! I've seen places with better decor but quite frankly,  if you want actual authentic Mexican food and ambience-this is where to go."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time with my dad. The bathrooms were very clean. And the staff were very friendly and accomodating. We had the super chimichangas with steak because they didnt have shredded beef or pork (a little disappointing). Otherwise, everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of the only Korean restaurants closes and it gets replaced by...another Mexican grease pit. Charlotte has ENOUGH mexican restaurants and we don't need any more. The food is terrible here and the drinks are too expensive. Charlotte needs unique food and restaurants, not the same old stuff we keep getting every time the mexican restaurant owners see a vacant building. Seriously, the best thing this business could do is close so maybe a decent restaurant could replace it."}
{"text":"great restaurant and food was delish. would deff recommend. try the costillas asada its beef short rib with special marinade i loved every bite desserts are also amazing all made in the back. rhey have good horchata too! deff gotta try more food next time good portions aswell. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"1 star in my mind is generous. I will say the staff was very nice, but that's about the end of my good review. From the minute we walked in I knew we should have walked out.   Strike 1. Atmosphere isn't just lacking, it's downright awkward and uncomfortable. The old hibachi hoods are still over tables that no \"exhibition cooking\" happens at. Exhaust hoods, these ones at least, are not design elements and should not still be hanging here. The booths were so uncomfortably arranged we had to switch seats because the table was so far from the booth we could not comfortably reach the table.   Then chips and salsa, the staple of all Mexican restaurants. Next strike. The salsa was generic like from a jar and the chips were the ultra thick kind with no flavor, yuck.  Speaking of no flavor, the food was bland, beyond bland and I felt over priced for what it was. Sadly even my diet Coke was gross.  Definitely will not be back.   If you're heading here from Charlotte go the extra mile to Casa Rita's and if you came from Monroe or Matthews, turn around...a way better Mexican meal awaits you down the road.  By the way, I am in NO way associated with Casa Rita's, just a big fan of theirs.    Oh and the sanitation score is from the old Korean restaurant, I thought that was a little weird."}
{"text":"I agree with the notion that there are simply too many mex joints in charlotte. Most of them are carbon copies of each other.   This place is honestly well below average. The ambiance is non existent, prices high and food quality is low.   I ordered a chicken quesadilla but received one with just cheese. It wasn't a big deal for me. I tried to eat it anyway but the cheese was very poor quality. The cheese had a sticky consistency and the flavor was non-existent.   I also ordered a guac and it was decent.   It surprised me that such a bland looking restaurant would mark up their food so much given the terrible quality. Carne Asada for 15?!   Lastly, this place charges 2.75 for soda. This is the highest price drink i have seen in any mex or even casual restaurant. I'm a business guy and I understand profit margins but this figure is so out of line with the competition.   I won't be back, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"It's a rare occasion for me to not bring my leftovers home... With that being said, while the staff is friendly the food is completely lacking flavor.   I ordered the cheese enchiladas- soggy tortillas, cheese wasn't melted, sauce was lacking flavor. The waitress offered to microwave them after we flagged her down, and luckily realized that remaking them was probably the better option. While the second batch was better, which is entirely relative to how awful the first were.  My mom ordered a chicken tamale which her kindest description of was \"yucky\"   For sure won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place beats my old favorite in downtown Matthews (El Valle).  Great good with unmatched customer service.  Even the owners came out and asked what we thought about the food.  $2 Blue Moons on special, salsa was amazing, supreme nachos were awesome.  Wife had the carne asada tacos and loved them.  Plenty of open seating available, nice set up, give this place a try.  What's with all the negativity people?  You out to get this place or what?    Food is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We went and ate here today.  It was not Good. The meat was just plain with no flavor.  Lunch truck taco are better than here.  Quesadillas  beef   Looks bad and taste bad. Better to go to a different Mexican restaurant in the area  we spent more than average and were rather disappoint.  Don't made the mistake we did"}
{"text":"Charlotte does have quite a few Mexican rest. However the places I've been to the food was quite bland .. The food here was great .. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was great the cheese was a gooey mess and perfect seasoning.. (Not sure what the guy ordered on one of the reviews,but totally diff from what I got) the salsa and guac are great and we also ordered the fajitas the meat has good taste to it and was cooked to perfection! Can't wait to come during the weekend to enjoy some drinks at the bar! The staff was great and friendly as well!  *** on a side note the other reviewer that posted negative remarks abt it being some korean place before.. It's not there anymore so why rate the new owners? Be angry somewhere else! Enjoy life guac and margaritas! Smile :)"}
