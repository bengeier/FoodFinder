{"text":"Jumbo wet burrito is amazing.   Best green chili pork sauce I've ever had.   It has a little heat and big chunks of slow cooked pork.   We ordered a side of the sauce to accompany the burritos and finished it with a spoon.   Can't let any go to waste!

We had a miscommunication with the bill and the manager cleared it up immediately.  She also gave us an additional 10% off our check.  Great customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"So, today (Wednesday) we went to the Heart and Soul cafe to get breakfast. Now, apparently they stop serving breakfast at 11:30 on weekdays, and since we were already there all the way from Peoria, we decided to give lunch a go. So, there menu wasn't horribly diverse, but we managed to get something that suited our tastes. I got  a turkey BLT and my mother got a... I think it was something like a southwestern burger (it had chilies). We got a seat right in front of the car booth, and it was a nice spot. The server was nice and friendly and the only thing that she messed up on was that at the end she gave us the wrong check (was quickly fixed). The food was good, and the burger my mom had was one of the best burgers that we've had in a long time. Mine was good, it was nice and fresh, but nothing special (it is REALLY huge though, and it's mostly stuffed with turkey). But the best part was the fries/ sweet potato fries. They were DELICIOUS. Anyways, we were satisfied and we're thinking of going back for breakfast some time."}
{"text":"Alrighty now... Moving to Phoenix and looking for a house. Hungry and seeking a place to eat. Well we were guided to a great little place with fantastic ambiance, let's call it retro gas station complete with a 57 Chevy booth, very KL indeed. So my beloved and I had the Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries... was to live for or is that die? Any way... Fresh, tasty, filling and served with love by Deanna. Our dear friend had the Cobb salad which was fresh as the morning dew and quite tasty. U gotta check this place out. When we move to this area it will be one of our haunts.
Gotta go back to Planet X"}
{"text":"Love this place for any meal.  Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"I want desperately to like this place. I keep going back in the hopes that things will change, improve somehow.  Yet each time I am confronted with one disaster after another.  The last time, it was roasted potatoes that were still frozen in the middle.  Before that, wrong cocktail order (but major points for a breakfast joint that serves booze), repeated requests for silverware/creamer/sugar ignored.  Our friends always rave about this  place and swear our bad experiences (three in total) are uncharacteristic of the restaurant. I keep trying, but so far no luck."}
{"text":"So I read the reviews and I told my daughter the food is allegedly good but the service is allegedly bad.  I live nearby and haven't tried it before so with my out of town daughter in tow we rolled down for breakfast.  Walked in, we're seated quickly and then..... Nothing for at least 10 minutes. At least 10 minutes.  Place was full but it was Saturday am.   My daughter started laughing after  the long wait and said \"well yelp got this one right\".  The server was nice but they seemed to not have any assigned areas they just wandered to random tables.  They needed at least one more server. My daughter said I guess they don't read yelp reviews.  The food was good but certainly not awesome.  I live 4 minutes away.  If you don't I wouldn't make this a destination restaurant.  Oh forgot some items we asked for.  If you want to eat in Cave Creek drive the extra minutes up to   Harold's or wherever and enjoy the ambiance of our little cowboy town"}
{"text":"We were starving after hiking the Go John trail and decided to try the Heart and Soul Cafe since it was so close to the mountain. There were so many great items to choose from on the menu. We decided on salads, and they were delicious. Very fresh ingredients, homemade dressings and complimentary, freshly baked cookies - white chocolate with cranberries - the perfect New Year's day!! We are definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and fresh. The french toast is to die for along with many other dishes. We try to go as much as we can I love the old cooler in the corner sounds like an old Harley at times LOL. Next door to Discount tire I now love getting my tires done because I know I'm going to have a great meal. Service could be better and it's really annoying that they don't  keep spoons on the table with the other utensils. Also the last couple of times we were there the air quality was really poor from the kitchen smoke."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! Super cute atmosphere too! It really brings the feel of cave creek into one place"}
{"text":"great place with good ambience. our hostess, Deanna, was really attentive and very friendly. I would have given it 5 stars but my chicken pot pie need a little more flavor."}
{"text":"I had the green chili burger and it was delicious! The decor in here is interesting- 50's diner, western, and tatted up biker all going on at the same time but the atmosphere is nice. Usually fries are nothing to write home about but the mix fries here are so freaking good! I think that chili burger is probably the best I've had. I can't wait to try them for breakfasts."}
{"text":"We were in the area visiting for 3 weeks and came here for lunch 3 times - that's how good it was!  Decor was cool, comfortable.  One of the booths was made from a '57 Chevy.  Service was always very friendly.  On each of the 3 lunches we had, I tried something different.  First time I had the Farmers Market Salad - it was huge, fresh, and tasty - salad greens were crisp, lots of veggies.  The second time I had the Balsalmic Chicken Wrap - chicken was tender, with greens, onions, avocados, red peppers and a balsalmic glaze - came with a side of sweet potato fries - delicious!! The next time I had the Cheddar burger - they serve half-pound burgers (huge!), cooked however you like them - this burger came with mixed fries (regular and sweet potato fries).  The burger seemed like it was hand-patted - not frozen - it was juicy and hot and good!  Definitely worth it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous, especially the buttermilk fried chicken! Aimee, our server was fabulous, too!"}
{"text":"Just tried to get breakfast and walked out. We walked in to no one even saying hello but 2 girls talking to each other. Waited 3 awkward minutes for them to finally say something and was finally say outside. Then sat for 30 minutes without anyone even saying hi or getting us a drink. Walked out and never coming back! You guys suck!"}
{"text":"Thank u Aimee!!  We were in a total rush this am!  We got our food quick, thx chef, and it was great!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!! The food is delicious and the service is top notch!  Friendly as can be."}
{"text":"Menu and ambience are good, but food was just ok. Was a little expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"Love the food! We have been there several times and have always had a great meal. They also have a pretty good wine selection :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've come with my family, met friends there several times, and I've even brought my ultra-picky relatives a time or two! The food is always absolutely incredible, and there really is something for everyone.

I am not a breakfast person, but I love breakfast at Heart and Soul! I'm a vegetarian and really prefer fresh, organic food, so it can sometimes be tricky to find good stuff at other restaurants. Not here! Although there are several things for me to choose from, I can't seem to get away from the veggie omelet. It's got yummy seasonal veggies inside, along with oh-so-good goat cheese and the perfect amount of spices. It's served with blue/white/sweet potatoes - fancy and tasty! There are lots of other things on the menu that others at my table have tried and loved, but I'm always so wrapped up in my own flavor sensation that I can't say I've really paid attention to what they've ordered, only their, \"OMG! This is soooo good!\" noises. :)

I've been to H&S for lunch several times and can't seem to move beyond the salad menu, although there are lots of other things. I never order salads at restaurants because I hate ordering things I can easily make at home, but they have such a nice combination of fresh things and tasty dressings that I order one every time. I have had the grilled veggie sandwich once, though, and although it was pretty good, I was back to a salad on my next trip.

I have read a lot of negative reviews regarding service. Although there have been times when things have been a bit slow, I've never had a problem with going up to a staff person and asking for what I need. They get busy, so I understand. It's a small-town-type place, though, so the owner/chefs are super friendly and love to come out and talk when they have time. I think that, if you're not accustomed to a diner-type atmosphere where wait staff is made up of your own neighbors, you might see it differently.

I will continue to go to Heart and Soul whenever I can swing it. I'd love to see this place stick around for a long, long time!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times.  Always great food.  Service was also great like always.  However, (and our waiter seemed hesitant when he dropped off the check) to have an auto-gratuity of 20% with a 6 top seemed awfully high, especially without any notice beforehand.  We've had groups of 8 and more and never had that before here. Don't get me wrong service was great and I would have done 20%, but either let me know ahead of time or let ME make the choice!"}
{"text":"Excellent Bacon Bloody Mary's!
Casey made a batch of these savory cocktails. 
The bacon was smoked and a bit."}
{"text":"cute cafe and decor, and nice patio area. large servings, good coffee. clean bathrooms. 
we went in the morning, around 9:15. 
service was subpar, the staff seemed stressed that it was Veterans Day and that it was going to be \"busy\".. water glass was empty for some time, had to ask for water refill, napkins, & condiments. had to share menus as half of our party was never brought any menus. 
food was just okay and wasn't hot when served. expected it to be good for the price. dirty plates remained on a couple of the tables surrounding us for most of the time we were there. 

patio made for great area to socialize, but service and food was lacking."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Heart and Soul Cafe since it opened, but unfortunately, I had a bad experience Saturday night. I made reservations and asked to be sat in the car inside the restaurant. I asked 3 times when I made the reservation if they would be able to seat us in the car at the time we would be there. I was assured that we would be. We invited another couple and told them about the car. When we arrived on time for our reservation, there was another couple in the car. They did not even have their food yet, so they had recently been seated. We were told they had been seated one and a half hours ago, which clearly was not the case. We had to sit at a table. So we decided to make the best of the experience. However, the disappointment continued. The drinks came one at a time, with one taking a long time to get to the table. The food arrival was even worse. Two people received their food, while the other two waited about 5 minutes. Then another plate arrived. One of us was still waiting for  food. So now 3 of us are waiting for the 4th person to get their food. It took about 10 more minutes to arrive. After finally getting the food, it tasted great. The drinks were great, but arrived slowly.  When ordering a 2nd drink, it had been made differently. Upon questioning the waiter, he said they ran out of limes, so they used other ingredients. They did remake the drink and it was better. I am on the VIP email they send out and they were offering 2 for 1, which we pointed out to the waiter when we arrived. When we received the bill, it did not have the discounts on it. We had to get the bill corrected. We left with a bad taste in our mouth about the experience and have decided that we probably won't go back. It seems the atmosphere and service has changed and not up to the standards that we have previously experienced."}
{"text":"2-4-2.  I visited this restaurant twice last week for lunch. Service and food were great!  I read the other reviews about there service, so maybe my expectations were low, but I must say the service was fast, the wait staff personalities were definitely in tune with me.  By the way, the burger was very fresh tasting and 2nd only to the white chocolate grill on mayo."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, we enjoyed a wonderful meal at Heart n Soul. The service was outstanding and the food was even better. We look forward to our next visit. 

It's sad that too often, those of us who love a business are so busy enjoying it that we forget to post our kind review and genuine accolades. It's only the people on a mission to complain that ever stop and post on these silly sites. I am proud to support such a fun, local restaurant - and on a personal mission to post my enthusiasm for my favorite area merchants."}
{"text":"just had breakfast here for the 1st time. and WOW!  the food was incredible. I had the chaqilles green chile over chips with eggs. and have to say it is one of the tastiest breakfast meals ever. so delicious.  Casey was our server and she was awesome. very upbeat and energetic. we will definately be back to see her and eat here again. food and service all top notch. and huge portions too!"}
{"text":"We rolled into HSC around 9:30 Sunday morning.  Luckily, we snagged one of the last couple of tables before folks had to wait a bit.  Turns out the breakfast food is five stars all the way.  Even though I don't like to wait for a table, I would for the amazingly diverse and tasty breakfast. 

My wife had the Roasted Veggie Omelet and I had a special called \"Some Like it Hot\".  After two bites of her omelet, my wife, Lucie, declared it her new all time favorite.  The peppers, asparagus, and other veggies were grilled to perfection. Inside was also just the right amount of cream cheese and seasonings.  The potatoes were a nice colorful mix cooked just right.

The Some Like it Hot is an imaginative southwestern twist on breakfast.  It has two jalapeno corn cakes, three strips of spicy jalapeno infused bacon, and two eggs.  Whoa...this was amazing.  I put my two over medium eggs on top of the corn cakes and let the yolk run down all over.  This was heaven on earth...the warm yolk was a perfect compliment to the savory corn cake.  I want these again NOW! 

The service, on the other hand, was a solid three stars.  Our waitress was very much \"to the point\", didn't smile, and seemed annoyed we were there.  It looked as though another server was late for work and she was letting it affect her service.  One of the waiters looked as though he hadn't changed clothes in a week...and maybe hadn't slept in as long.

Check out the web site for their menu and you will be impressed.  Assuming the service was just a one time glitch, I'm looking forward to coming back and increasing to five stars."}
{"text":"We've had many a good breakfast here but tonight was the first time having dinner and it was very good.  Menu was rather extensive and quite varied, which made for a tough time deciding on what to order.

We started with a special app., \"a little of this, a little of that\" which was 2 bite-size chicken pot pies, 2 bite-size rustic pies, 2 meatballs and 2 empanadas.  The wife and I were very impressed!  I had Mama's Bowl of Goodness which was a meatball and italian sausage in a tomato based sauce over penne pasta, and my wife had a mixed green salad w/strawberries, goat cheese & almonds.  We were both quite pleased with our dishes and wished we could have tried the rhubarb pie on the specials menu, but we were stuffed .  The only complaint would be the rather small pours of wine, but that won't deter us from coming back soon.  We are very happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Wednesday in Dec, so consider that when I say the service was great, and everyone was very friendly.  We often look for something unique that a local breakfast joint does well.  H&S had homemade jalapeno cheese sauce for the eggs benedict that I loved, and granola pancakes with raspberries that were delicious.  Coffee was on the lowere end of typical cafe coffee.  Regardlless, we would definitely come here again then next time we're at Boulders."}
{"text":"I would like to write a review about the food but after being seated and waiting for a server for 25 minutes after asking twice we finally gave up.  Third time in past few months we have tried to eat here and each time the service got worse.  They got our orders wrong or didn't bring everything at once - some of our group never did get their meals. Trying to get the right bill was even worse - their reasoning today was we weren't supposed to be seated in the back area - even tho there were about 25 people in that area - when they did come to take our order we asked how long it would be and she didn't know as there was a waiting list in the kitchen ????? no management there to talk to and no apologies from anyone that their service was so terrible.  Yes we have a choice to not return and I never write reviews but today I felt after three consecutive bad experiences it was time to   I gave it a one star but it deserves a \"no star\"."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this café for the first time. The food was great, BUT it was very difficult to overlook the bad service and general disorganization.  Hostess continued to seat people at dirty and unset tables. Poorly managed - the servers where pretty vocal about not knowing which tables to deliver the food to. Delivering us another table's food. After about 30 minutes we received our breakfast order. All easy fixes if the restaurant is managed properly. There are too many options in town with great food & consistent and friendly service to return to this café.  I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW! I came here during lunch time as it appears after their breakfast crowd rush and this place was dirty. I was literally the only person their and yet two of the waitresses standing around were busy on the phone and talking to each other instead of cleaning the disgusting floors.

Not to make my review sound harsh, but the floors were actually disgusting and no better way to put it. Including greasy smudge marks on the windows that look to have been there for a while.

As I mentioned I was the only customer there at the time and my waitress never filled my ice tea even though she was busy organizing bar items and talking on the phone. 

The food was hot and appeared to look the part at first, but after I ate their my memory of the food was not so good. I do this sometimes to where I eat somewhere and think its not bad when Im eating it then realize later it was not so good.

Overall I will never go back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Food here was delicious, i would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Yes, service was that bad. And I believe Matt our server was the owner or manager. All of our table got the feeling that we were bothering him somehow, it wasn't even busy. He would run away as soon as he dropped off our drinks before we could even ask for cream for coffee, I stared at him for 20 minutes trying to get his attention before I retired and asked another server who looked much busier than him. Same story with our food, he HANDED us our food to pass around to whoever it belonged to and ran away as soon as his hands were free- wait ranch! Everything look ok? Nope, he was gone. And didn't return until he brought the check, joy. No eye contact, smile, or thanks for coming in. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've never posted a review on yelp, but I had such a terrible experience here, it needs to be shared. I am from New York and came here with my family on our trip from Sedona to Scottsdale. Right off the bat this place was bad. We went for lunch at noon but we're told they wouldn't be serving lunch for another half hour. My mom ordered a tea and was given a dirty mug. She asked for a new one and was given ANOTHER dirty mug. She was not given a utensil to stir her tea, so she asked for one, to which the waitress responded rudely. The waitress brought us rolled silverware, but still no spoon for stirring the tea.My sister and I ordered sodas, but weren't given straws and had to retrieve our own from the bar.
The staff was rude. They were bothered by us asking for things like clean mugs.
I ordered an over easy egg and it came fried over hard. The lemon ricotta pancakes tasted nothing like lemon or ricotta.. Or pancakes for that matter. Eggs tasted like egg beaters. My home fries had big pieces of left over Deep fried dough that must have been left in the frying basket.
I actually can't think of a worse dining experience. I don't know how this place has such good reviews."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy Sunday am (11:00 is still morning right?), for one of the best omelets I've ever had. Served with a side of stewed pintos and freshly made tortilla (you will taste the difference!), I tucked into the Adobada omelet and proved my waitress' opinion...\"it's like chorizo, but better!\" The meat is not in a case like chorizo, but hash style mixed with onions and jalapeno Inside the omelet with sliced avocado on top. Friendly wait staff made for a delightful breakfast. Highly recommend!

Visited January 2016"}
{"text":"Beware \"All you can eat.\" You may not want to & go home hungry. I kno Talapia is not ideal for fried fish. Still...breading tasteless, some pieces stinky, fries went limp & served with 1 T. slaw. Successful breakfast on another occasion but all pricey. Local, not happy."}
{"text":"Had the suicide breakfast  here today with 7 other people and it was awesome!  The food was great and the service was really good, too. The owner/chef makes the 13 layer breakfast and then delivers it to the table personally. They advertise as feeding four people but 7 of us could barely finish it!! We saw the restaurant on the food network & knew we wanted to try on a visit ti Phoenix area - it was totally worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"Had good expectations but was let down with poor service and sub par food"}
{"text":"Everyone was very nice as usual, we have been there many times.  In the bar section I ordered the Overworked Cowboy based on the menu description.  As it tirned out, It was a plate full of pinto beans with scrambled eggs on top.  Maybe two or three very small pieces of ham.  There was a short dark haired young lady wlth a pony tail that came by our table several times that I would try to hire if I were still in buisiness."}
{"text":"Very nice place to grab a bit to eat.  Big portions friendly staff.  They should push the bacon more it was amazing.  Yes I know all bacon is amazing.  This was bacon squared.   Get the full body Mary and the biscuits and gravey or chicken fried steak.  They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my friends and when I was there visited this place about four times!  The service is awesome and the food is amazing!  I had the rustic pie and wow!  the flavors, the flakiness of the pot pie itself.. amazing.  Then for lunch I had the blue cheese burger and the meat was perfectly cooked, the blue cheese was perfectly portioned on the burger and the potato bread!  OMG, this place is worth every wow and awe.  It is family owned and the chef is female, which totally rocks.  They are so kind.  They come out and greet you and the place itself is contemporary with a classic feel.  I will be returning there next week for sure :)"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant outside of the heart of Cave Creek. Service was friendly, a little slow, but their charm made up for it. 

$10.99 - Chilaquilas & Eggs 

Good flavor. Came out hot. And liked the addition of chips. Only sad part was the menu stated it came with pork green chili ... But there was no pork when it was served just an abundance of green chili. 

My friend had their Bloody Mary and said it was amazing. And they use a fancy salt that she couldn't get over!"}
{"text":"First time, and not the last time. Had the Works Omelet, which came loaded with meat and cheese, not too fluffy on the eggs, amazingly chewy sourdough bread, and a beautiful medley of potato's.

My wife had the pancakes (super flavorful, fluffy but dense, and great syrup) with beautiful bacon, perfect amount of meat, not too fatty.

All around great experience, and fantastic breakfast food. You must go."}
{"text":"Good food and even better drinks!! And the strawberry salad is delicious!! I love this place"}
{"text":"I love love this place.. Breakfast pancakes are delicious and morning cocktails are fabulous.. To all the negativity out there go somewhere else.. I always get wonderful service here and Matt is awesome.. But my family really misses Lexi ( aka Daisy ).. If you want a fabulous YUMMY & filling breakfast or lunch this place is it.."}
{"text":"Yum!  Favorite breakfast place in this area. I love the granola raspberry pancakes and as a special they had it as French Toast today!  Food and service is always great!"}
{"text":"Went a couple years ago and my friend wrote an unflattering review, because the wait staff was slow, un attentive, just not a good time   Anyway, back today with friends from Oregon.  Completely different experience. Seated fast, order taken, food hot, coffee frequently topped off without asking.
My friends wife has serious food allergies and other issues. The waitress wrote everything down and before cooking the chef came out to confirm that her eggs would be cooked in a pan without any ingredients bad for her. 
It's been two years, but I'm glad I went back.  Great experience all around"}
{"text":"Poor service, low food quality. Ordered breakfast, they forgot the eggs on my wife's plate. When I asked for it, they supplied one, but charged me for it,. (mind you it was supposed to come with the meal). My meat was like leather, quite terrible and way over cooked. Food lacked any seasoning to speak of. The kids food was mediocre at best, they stated \"I didn't like it very much\". Manager on duty was rather rude about it. I will not go back. Complete waste of over fifty bucks."}
{"text":"Love love love Casey!  Our Cowgirl breakfast came out a little less than good. Casey was gracious and took our plate back to the kitchen.  The result was a beautifully juicy chicken breast, awesome gravy and as many have mentioned amazing green chili.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere..however my family was quite disappointed with the service. Having a 2yr old we order from the kids menu, they place her hot plate directly in front of her. She reached and grabbed a potato and stuck it in her mouth before daddy or I had a chance to temp check it. Sure enough she burnt her mouth so bad she refused to eat the rest of her meal. On top of that, they do not offer any pork alternatives. So, if you are allergic or kosher you are suck with ordering eggs as a substitute. Well, I ordered the scrambled eggs as a substitute and it was served directly on top of my pancakes...gross since they where runny. YUCK! I then asked for an extra plate to place my eggs, when I moved my eggs there was a long hair in my runny scramble..that was my tipping point and reason for this bad review. Maybe it was an off day for them? But our poor first experience doesn't leave me wanting to come back. Which is a real shame, since we absolutely loved the atmosphere and live near by."}
{"text":"If you are looking for breakfast its the very best place in town. Menu is very creative. The chef comes up with new items consitently. Everything I have had was amazing. I can say that my experiences outside of breakfast have been far from perfect but breakfast is so great I could not imagine giving it any less then 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I went to Heart and Soul Cafe. I overheard a little conversation that the restaurant was sold, but that everything was going to stay the same. I had two wonderful experiences here, one with friends for lunch about a month ago, and the other last week. Both our servers were warm and attentive. The restaurant is really homey, except for the pretentious 1957 Chevy car booth, which we had to sit in just once for the experience. Interesting how people either love the car or hate it . . . True classic car aficionados can't believe that someone would actually do that to an otherwise glorious specimen!

Our lunches, both the first time and the second, were fresh, of good quality, and plentiful. There was no skimping on the sides of potatoes, or on the sandwiches or salads themselves. I do wish they would serve some breakfast items until later in the day, but it gives us another reason to go back. 

Unlike some other reviewers, we found that we received great value for the price.

I hope with the new ownership that nothing changes. You know what they say, \"If it ain't broke . . . \""}
{"text":"Very nice - had the best Bacon Bloody Mary. Great Burgers and the Pork Chili is very nice and spicy. So happy that I live right off Carefree Highway!"}
{"text":"I have been to Heart and Soul 3 or 4 times and unfortunately have never had good service. The food is alright but the service is just terrible. I was there with some good friends today to catch up over breakfast and I am now certain I will never go back. 

The restaurant had about three or four tables that were occupied and our food took 40 minutes to come out. There were four of us. In addition, my sister's food was wrong when it came out and it took another 15 minutes to be ready (she ordered an english muffin and two scrambled eggs).  The waitress seemed incredible annoyed when we asked her to please bring the right order. 

When we were finished, an hour and a half later, our waitress forgot to split our check and refused to do so when she was asked. Unfortunately she isn't the only waitress to have been rude and unhelpful. 

We have continued to encounter awful service here and the food is just not good enough to deal with that. We love to support local restaurants and truly tried to keep giving them second chances, but unfortunately we will just not be returning to Heart and Soul. Hope this helps! I would suggest Oaks Diner or Janey's Coffeehouse in Downtown Cave Creek as better alternatives."}
{"text":"Had Breakfast on Saturday. Good service, clean and comfortable atmosphere. Not a lot of choices for am eats in Vistancia area. Worth the drive"}
{"text":"I love this place. When I go there the quality of the food is always consistent, it's has great flavor and I think it's reasonable priced. Our service was excellent, very attentive and the atmosphere was clean and it's always the right temperature. The building is set back of the street a bit so don't miss it when driving by. I recommend this place if you live in Anthem, Cave Creek, Carefree or North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. Food is home cooking and is great when you don't want to cook at home. What makes this place great is the staff!!! They are friendly, caring and genuine. Coming here is like a second home with extended family. 

Wednesday nights are all you can eat fried chicken.... Yummmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"So nothing about tonight was good at all. From the moment we got there the older lady working at the bar was rude and basically acted like we were an inconvenience. The drinks she made were not even sub par. And we couldn't get her attention because she was too busy waiting hand and foot on somebody else...... food was alright will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was great. We sat in the bar to watch the game. Our server was on point! Great food and service! Ask for Scott. His bacon bloodys are terrific and great after a long night!  
 I had the blueberry bacon pancakes! Super delicious."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar!! Awesome breakfast too!  Dog friendly.  Live music Weds thru Friday.  Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Have been here for breakfast and lunch. Excellent green chile pork and the chile Colorado was to die for! Chilaquiles are pretty spicy so beware if you are a gringa like me!"}
{"text":"The food was really very good. We had the Beef Stroganoff and a chicken dish. Portion size was large but not too large and the prices were of a decent value. The food tasted great. The staff is comprised of the cutest guys in the valley and service was spot on. 
The concept itself is confusing and total mystery. It's a combination of diner/bar/1950's decor, art deco, 1920's and cowboy bar. Let's not forget the 1950's car in the middle of the restaurant, the disco ball hanging from the ceiling and the county music blaring. :)"}
{"text":"We went out for a family brunch one Sunday. This place was great. Atmosphere was nice and the staff was amazing and friendly. The food was great too."}
{"text":"Nice and small place. I had the rustic pie, and I love it. Very friendly and kind staff
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Got back for the Wed nite all you can eat fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and spinach w vegetables.  You cannot go wrong with this meal at $9.99.  The lamb burger w feta also delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in three people working near the door didn't acknowledge us for a couple of minutes, one of them even walked by us twice. Seen a dirty rag put on top of clean silverware. Waitress walked by a number of times and never offered a refill of my drink."}
{"text":"Not recommended for dinner. Breakfast... Maybe. Dinner atmosphere is no different than breakfast diner feel and you are forced the listen to awful karaoke while trying to enjoy your meal. Food was gross. We won't be back."}
{"text":"A great selection of breakfast dishes...I didn't know what to choose.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, which was fine. Service was good and wait staff was friendly.  I had the blueberry bacon pancakes and they were soooo good!  All three of my kids had clean plates as well.  My husband got the crazy biscuits (I think that was the name of it) and he said it was delicious.  My sister-in-law got pumpkin pancakes and she was a fan.  We plan to go again as we want to try more of their menu.

We say inside, however they have a nice large patio.  The restaurant is really cute inside and has a nice warm feel.  You can even dine in a car!

Overall a great place!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I have been here several of times but today had a hair in my salad, my server was nice and they discounted 50%? If this was my resturant I would of comped the whole meal? How sad I wont return here because of the experience not like sheila's food"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for breakfast on our way to Sedona. The place is charming and the food exceeded my expectations. I'm not much of a breakfast food person but decided to give the Chorizo Omelette a try. It was delicious; Not greasy or heavy, just delicately flavored with light cheese, avocado, and chorizo. My mom ordered the Bacon & Blueberry pancakes which we all demanded she share (they were out of this world good) and my dad and husband both had the Heavenly Hash which was ok, but lacked potatoes which left them both a bit disappointed. If I'm in the area again, I will definitely be back for some pancakes!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch because of all the gleaming reviews and left disappointed. Quality of food was disgusting. Really not any difference than say a Denny's or a Good Egg. I guess those places also have an overall rating of four stars as well. Gross, greasy food that make you feel yucky all day."}
{"text":"I come here with my son every other weekend, and it's more than worth the 12+ mile one-way trip.  The food is always well prepared, and the service is excellent.  Great looking place too.  Try the Crazy Biscuits, my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, outstanding service.  We had the country fried steak and eggs with 9 grain toast, the chorizo omelette with 9 grain toast and 1 bacon and blue pancake to try.  Food was awesome, eggs cooked as ordered etc. and I couldn't finish everything.  Refills were prompt for our coffee and ice tea and we were even able to take a To Go cup of both with us!  Kasey was energetic and upbeat... always making sure we had what we needed.  This was our first time coming here and plan to return."}
{"text":"Just don't go here. Rude servers who couldn't be bothered. Food that you could make better yourself at home. Dirty cups. I don't understand the outstanding reviews. Save your money.

I should mention that we were there for Saturday breakfast. Maybe the lunch and dinner menu is better but regardless, the service was enough to make up my mind."}
{"text":"Great service. Our waitress knew what she was talking about. Got the corned beef hash st patty day special with poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise. Omg is was so good. Definitely recommend the bacon jalapeño bloody mary everyone else said was a winner. We also had the crazy biscuits and gravy because of the yelp reviews--they did not disappoint. They are on the spicy side and the biscuits are dense but it's a good combo with the green chile verde pork sauce and gravy."}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast. I love the granola pancakes. You might want to order only one because they are huge!!!!
Happened to stop by for lunch and was surprised at the great lunch menu. I had grilled chicken with pickle and cookie. Cookie was home made and delicious. Sandwich had all fresh ingredients and was AWESOME!! 
Do make time to stop by. The car in center of cafe is always added perk for children!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Took my cousin here who requested chocolate chip pancakes which they made for him although they aren't on the menu. My husband and I always bring out-of-town guests here for breakfast. More upscale than The Good Egg but with reasonable prices. Ask for Deanna! She's a perfect waitress!"}
{"text":"Food can be really hit or miss. I've had some if the best fried chicken or but some nights the color and taste is off maybe clean the fryers more often? Especially for the prices."}
{"text":"Simply put- try the bacon and blueberry pancakes. Just the right amount of real bacon bits."}
{"text":"Such a unique place inside, the breakfast we had was a very large portion and the sausage gravy and chicken fried steak was delicious. I loved the availability of veggies for my omelet."}
{"text":"My Husband and I took my Grandma here for the first time this past Mother's Day (I know sorry for the late review).  I was really pleased that they took a reservation for the day because I've heard there can be a long wait.  Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly (after they cleared the table).  Our waitress was prompt and nice.  Overall, I like the decor, but the atmosphere felt very crowded and overwhelming to me... maybe it was just because of the holiday.

I ordered the crazy biscuits, which I didn't love.  It was very heavy, which was obvious that it would be, but the taste didn't blow me away.  The Hubs had pancakes, which were really good.  My Grandma had the hash, which I didn't try, but she loved.  Based on this experience alone, I would go back considering so many people love it.  I would probably try something completely different though."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing comfort food!  The servers are friendly and fast.  Prices are good (for Cave Creek).  Ambience was fun.  Great place to take the family (including children)."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The amount of food on the plates, can be spilt and eaten over two meals. This has become a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Another incredible meal at the Soul Cafe! My wife and friends said, where would you like to dine tonight and they offered up \"Houstons\" on Scottsdale Road, which is a great place. But I said, what about a little more less upscale and lighter food. So we went for Soul Cafe.

I have dined here in the past and always had great food. The owner and female chef Alma never ceases to amaze me with her ever evolving menu. One time we dine and its Oso Buco and last night it was wonderful fish. I happen to have Arctic Char and it was great. You see, I'm in the fish Bussiness and love good fish.

My friends wife had Mahi Mahi, her husband had Blackened Grouper and raved about the wonderful meal. I guess the bonus was that the snowbirds have flown and the Restraunt was easy to get into for a Saturday night.

So I would highly recommend this place to dine on a whim or just spend the evening with wife and or friends. Oh yeah, they have music on most Saturdays that is real nice."}
{"text":"Breakfast was mediocre at best. Bland. Not cozy. We live close and never go here so it's just not our fav breakfast place. Service was ok."}
{"text":"I remembered this place from a few years ago.  So we tried it again.

The Service was awesome!!!  The food was just ok though.  I had Biscuits and gravy, eggs and toast... I know Toast?  I need them with my eggs... lol. 

The Gravey was cold.  A real bummer for me.  I always wonder if something that comes out cold is being held in the kitchen at the correct temp or it just sits out.

The good thing is that the server promptly took the food back and had it remade. Other than being microwaved gravy it was ok.

The big star here was the server.  She Was Awesome!!!!

Probably won't be back though.  

Please try this place, its not horrible.  Large patio for you and your K9 friends."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but hadn't been here in more than a year- probably longer. We went for dinner last Friday. My husband had the fish fry and I had the fish taco special. The taco literally had whole fried cod on the tacos. It was an odd presentation but not a big deal. I have never had a fish taco that did not have bite size fish pieces in it. His fries were soggy and he chose not to eat more than a few. Both of us agreed the fish was well fried and tasted good. Both of us felt that the food was no longer homemade and special. It was ok but nothing special. We both left thinking that there are too many good places so unlikely to return here."}
{"text":"We have now eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Heart and Soul Cafe and can say with 100% certainty that EVERY meal rocks!

For breakfast, the granola raspberry pancakes OR the Italian sausage Fritatta , both at only 8.99, will make you want to try everything on the menu.

For lunch, a fresh peach salad with grilled chicken OR a chicken salad sandwich, served with homemade chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven, really hit the spot.

For dinner, the  buttermilk fried chicken is worth the trip. Served with country pork gravy, it is like no other fried chicken you have ever tasted. and that's saying a mouthful!  We came back the NEXT night and ordered the salmon with fresh mango salsa served over grilled asparagus and baby roasted sweet, blue, red and white potatoes. WOW, a burst of fresh flavor combinations in every bite.

Dessert, that is another area where Chef Sheila (the owner) shines! The red velvet cake with chocolate sauce is in a class by itself. The hot nut pie with vanilla ice cream, to die for. The apple cake served with hot cider sauce, mmmmmmmmmmmm...the temptations never stop.

When you combine the relaxing and fun atmosphere, the superior menu offerings, with specials that change nightly, and the value,  you will not find a better home cooked meal in the Valley.

Heart & Soul says it all.  They care about every detail."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places. We came last week at 3pm for a late lunch, and the Bacon Ranch sandwiches were huge and delicious. Decided to finally try it today for breakfast and the Crazy Biscuits with pork chili verde were wonderful. Sometimes it can be a little bit of a wait, but hey, they are making real food in the back!"}
{"text":"What is it with the service and quality of food at the restaurants in this area? We again had another negative experience and this time it was at Heart and soul cafe. The food is OK we have eaten there a few times. The major issue I am having is the service the completely did not have there act together. It looked like a combination of issues landing between poor waitress/waiters and short staffing. As we sat for over 15 minutes waiting for someone to come and get our drink order we watched one table go to the bar to get a drink as no one came to there table and we watched another table tell the waitress they were leaving due to the lack of attention/service. when we showed our 5% off check in office to the waitress she did not apply it and we couldn't get her attention to fix it. The hostess was the one who supported most of the tables with there orders and seating costumers. The kitchen also had the food out promptly but it took over an hour merely waiting on the waitress."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning, busy place but the staff was on the ball and made sure everyone was taken care of! The bloody mary's are good and will wake you up! Little pricey at 7.50 each! Food was very good and very well prepared! Side order of bacon for 3.95 for 3 broken strips that really looked like two strips was a little high priced as well. I would give this restaurant a four star for food and service, but the pricing for value I have to give it a 3 star!"}
{"text":"Strawberry salad is wonderful as is the fried chicken. Be sure to come by and sign in to yelp for a 5% discount"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we loved it!  Bloody Mary's were excellent and breakfast was fresh and hot. I wanted to be sure to thank the friendly staff and give 2 Thumbs up for this restaurant. Also attached bar that opens at 11. Great breakfast lunch and dinner spot for the entire family!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant. The food is exceptional, and the service is first class. All of their salads are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Dined here in Feb. 2017.  The ambience was interesting and the food was good.  The talapia was well prepared and the salads were excellent.  The pot pie was very good.  
Only 2 stars because the waitress was short and frankly insulting to a member of our party.  Her behavior put a damper on our dining experience."}
{"text":"We visit weekly.  Food: Excellent.  Specials:  Excellent.  Nice patio. Did i mention Food:  Excellent?  Cool atmosphere.  Parking is never a problem.  Must be Excellent for families - there are a lot of them. Best server is Kasey."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and the music is great friendly atmosphere. Pick O' the Litter plays great music and they are very talented."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while we were camping in Cave Creek. I wish there was one close by, it would be a weekly breakfast place. Portions are large, come hungry, share, or plan on taking some home. Breakfast burrito was very good. Their version of green chili was a nice change from regular pork green chili. Biscuits and gravy were also very good.
I hope find myself in the area in the near future for breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice place! Great breakfast!  All you can eat fried chicken on Wednesdays for $9.99!  My daughter had the chicken special tonight, I had the strawberry goat cheese salad - it was HUGE for 6 bucks!  Our service was very nice!  Looking forward to $2.00 street taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed feelings about this place for a while.  On our first visit, the food was tasty but the service was terrible.  On our second visit, they were out of a lot of everything.  I had more or less written this place off.  

However, in our neighborhood, restaurants are slim pickins'.  I kept seeing reviews for breakfast/brunch at Heart & Soul and decided to give it a whirl once more.  

I'm glad we did.  They offer $3 mimosas on the weekends which were quite tasty (it may have been cheap bubbly but it didn't taste like it).  For those who prefer a hair of the dog, they have a bacon bloody mary that was delicious as well.  My apple pancakes were delicious - clearly homemade and freshly prepared.  I had a bite of the bacon blue pancakes (which were very interesting) as well as the crazy biscuit.   They pride themselves on their pork green chile but I found the real star to be the pork gravy.  

Service was attentive and prompt.  I think we have a winner!  :)"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in the area. Never had a bad meal at Heart and Soul. Loads of yummy food. Lunch and dinner are fabulous too. Love seating in the car and really enjoy the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, and mediocre service. Dirty menus, dirty patio and food was lukewarm as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for longer then it should have. Was greeted and brought to a table on the patio. Silverware from the past guests were underneath the table, table wasn't wiped down, or the menus. They brought us our water and coffees, took our order and our server never checked back as someone else ran the food. No refills, no \"how's your like warm food, nothing\". Also had to flag another person down for our check. Hopefully this was a one off, but I won't be going out of my way to try this place again."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast yesterday and it was awesome! Between all of us there was the cowgirl, cowboy, wet burrito and pancakes and eggs. The portions are tremendous. The coffe was good and strong. Our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why the rating isn't higher for this place. It really is excellent! The atmosphere is a lot of fun the service is good and quick and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and awesome spicy bloody mary. Good service and fun atmosphere.
Anxious to try it for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great lunch.  Haven't tried them for dinner yet.  Healthy choices, fantastic waitresses and fun decor.  You can't beat Heart and Soul Cafe!"}
{"text":"We came here with my in-laws. They had been here before and liked it. We visited for a late lunch and the restaurant had a fe patrons. I was very surprised at the aloofness of the staff. Considering how slow it was, I was impressed at the amount of time the food took to come out of the kitchen. The kitchen staff stepped out to the front of the restaurant, appearing bored perhaps, while we sat and waited. The food was not a tall order, and besides a few sandwhiches and a veggie salad, none of the food should have taken 30 minutes to prepare. The waitress was kind, but stayed far away during the entire time we were waiting for food, not once coming by to let us know the status of the order (big No-No, if you ask me). In the end, everyone seemed satisfied with the food itself. Salmon, and roast beef sandwiches were good. I had the roasted vegetable salad that left much to desire. The eggplant was almost absent and hard, the other vegetables were diced into small cubes, which were not appetizing, and again, very minimal. It was mostly greens. The dressing seemed like it was out of a bottle, not bad, but nothing you can't toss at home. I visit Arizona a few times a year, but I won't be going out of my way to come back to Heart and Soul Cafe. So sorry."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I will keep coming back! The bloody Mary's are excellent!! The food was fantastic!! And I left full!! I like the atmosphere both inside and out!! My only complaint was that the service is hit or miss. We ate outside, our last visit, and the server was very lax about checking on us, It couldn't be blamed on being busy because it really wasn't. when we started visiting with the peeps at the table next to us they said they had experienced service as poor as ours. It wasn't so bad that we wont be going back though!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Heard and read great things about food , so had to try. 
A little expensive for what it is , 16-17$ for fried chicken , mashed potatoes with gravy and veggies.
In the beginning we ordered an appetizer of fried green tomatoes to try. The server came back and let us know they were out. That was fine we totally understood. There was 6 of us in the party . We ordered 5 full meals . We also ordered bloody Mary's , btw they were awesome!! Everything was wonderful, the food the atmosphere and the service. 
When we finished our meals the server came to our table with 6 spoons and napkins saying she had a surprise for us. A few minutes later she brought us out an apricot cobbler and told us she was extremely sorry they didn't have the appetizer we had requested. 
This was so nice we thought , and so we finished . 
Here's the reason for 3 stars:
The server brings us our check and the cost of the appetizer is still on it. We then made her aware of it , she took the cost of the appetizer off . But now ----- she's added the cost for the cobbler we NEVER ORDERED OR ASKED FOR 
No one wanted to say anything AGAIN, so we just paid it and still left our server over a 20% tip. 
This is why we won't go BACK!! 
We are so confused and hope everyone else looks closely to their check when the server brings you a surprise !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch for the first time. I ordered the beef stroganoff and my husband ordered a plain burger (no dice or vegetables) but they brought it with the sauce and vegetables. They took it back and like fried the meat or something to get the sauce off. The food was no good, overpriced and service was okay until we had to ask for the correct burger. The decor is really cute but we won't be returning or recommending friends to go there."}
{"text":"A little smaller that I first thought, but cosy. Staff efficient and friendly   The meal took a little more time than I thought it should to come out.  

We ordered the beef stroganoff with a baguette and the balsamic glazed pork chop with vegetables.   

The stroganoff  had a good flavour.  The noodles were perfect not over cooked and soggy   The meat was a little tough at times.  The bread was not a baguette  it was a tasteless bread stick covered in garlic butter. It would have been better to have been a proper baguette with no garlic butter


The pork chop was extremely tasty and moist    The weak link on this plate was the side. It was just summer squash , zucchini with a few beans thrown in. The mashed potato was a little dry but tasted nice 

While I did not have the peach cobbler it did look awesome"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something near where I live and I had heard this place was good. 3 of us went for an early  lunch not realizing they serve only breakfast until a certain time. By the time I got a good read of the menu, I decided on breakfast and got the order in right at the cusp of breakfast and lunch. My friends were then able to order lunch a few minutes later. All meals were more than enough and we took left overs home. Omelet, wrap which was huge, and lovely salad. Food and drinks came in a timely manner and the place was fairly full. Waitress pleasant, kept my tea flowing. I will be going back and highly recommend for either meal."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and made to order! You can literally taste how fresh everything is! The staff is wonderful also -- extremely friendly and helpful. They always have a smile on their face when you see them; you can tell they enjoy working there. The raspberry granola pancakes are absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious!!! You gotta try them! You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"Just had yet another great breakfast.   For us it is about the green pork chili verde    One order of chilaquiles and one wet burrito--hold the potatoes.   Crave-able.    Service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu here is epic. So many things to pick from. I went with the breakfast burrito which was  huge!  the service here was great and they kept filling my cup of apple juice up. The decor was cowboy americana style which was pretty cool coming from the southeast/northeast. I enjoyed the food very much."}
{"text":"Justin convinced us to come back and give them another try. The service was great this time. I had the joshy something (kind of like eggs Benedict with jalapeño cheese instead of hollandaise) and my husband had the cowgirl (fried chicken thing with green chili and gravy on it). We actually enjoyed it very much this time. Didn't have any cocktails but I'm sure those are about the same. I'll up my rating and be willing to go back again. We got to sit in the car this time, which added to the experience."}
{"text":"This I a great breakfast place a little packed on Sunday's as it should be if it's any good! Great good good service and always a great place for family! We love sitting in the car but sometimes it doesn't fit our whole family! Gotta come and try it out!"}
{"text":"Ive had two experiences at the heart and soul cafe. The first time my girlfriend and I enjoyed the best bloody Mary Ive ever had as well as  generous and well cooked breakfast portions. The service was friendly but a bit slow. I'd give it four stars! - I just returned from a poor lunch experience though..Although the service was excellent and our cute server Sherry made us feel at home, the food was a major disappointment. Admittedly it was just before lunch closing but that's not a very good excuse. I took my brother for the famous bloody Mary but it was bland and weak. The once fresh bacon garnish was cold and congealed and I tasted more Ice than Mary..The fried chicken dish was burnt at the sides and dried out..I'm sure It had been sitting for a while - They mixed in some sweet potato fries with the regular fries (probably to make it seem more generous) but both were cold and stale. My brother's burger was also overdone..A two star experience..Two entrees two Mary's and a beer - $60..ouch.."}
{"text":"Yummy food &huge portions. Great for family style sharing!
They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Unique menus they have the traditional stuff and their own recipe"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood find! I live just around the corner and was so exited to find a new regular place to go out to eat! The place has a great atmosphere with an old Chevy Right in the center. The staff could not be any more friendly either! When it comes to the food, you can't go wrong! The fried chicken is to die for, and I can't wait to come for breakfast to try the berry granola pancakes. I give it an A++!"}
{"text":"I came here for their all you can eat fried chicken on Wednesdays. Little did I know they ALSO have another one of my favorite foods, chicken pot pie. Except it wasn't really a pie, it was more of a chicken gravy with pie crust over it. The presentation was cute but the food itself wasn't up to my standard to be honest. The pie was mostly gravy with little of the other things you love about a chicken pot pie, lots of celery, carrots, peas and truly hearty pieces of chicken. 

The big thing is that I found their fried chicken, while generous in portion to be on the dry side and it felt like it didn't have that real crisp feel too it. Also be aware that their fried chicken is boneless, which isn't to say it's bad, just that it wasn't what I was expecting. I think for the most part it was an unfortunate circumstance of differing expectations compared to reality. 

I thought the restaurant itself had a nice thematic decoration to it and the staff was very kind and accommodating. Unfortunately given how the food was in my book just alright, it doesn't warrant driving so far north to try their chicken. I would say you'd probably find equivalently good or even better fried chicken around you instead of trekking 20 minutes north of Scottsdale to try their food. Overall, decent, just not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Man I wish this place was better! Called and spoke to Jasmine and made reservations for a surprise dinner for my husband, asked to be seated closest to the car, she said it would be no problem at all. Our reservation was made for 7pm.  My daughter went in as she got there first and they didn't even have our reservation. We didn't get the table we asked for and we were seated by the front door even though the restaurant was pretty opened for seating.

For appetizers, we ordered the green chili nachos which were good and the queso dip which was a liquid soup and was awful. Nothing thick or cheesy about the queso dip, I would skip it. 

My husband and I ordered burgers, asked for it to be cooked medium and it came out overcooked, so overcooked that the ends around the burgers cracked and fell off. Truly, it was so burned and dry that it broke away from the rest of the hamburger. 

Daughter got the chicken tenders, they were good, I shared with her rather than eating my burger.

Service was bad, didn't have silverware and napkins, had to ask for plates when we got our appetizers.

Again, wish it was a better experience and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Update: I've been here several times since my first visit many years ago. The service and the food has been top-notch. I noticed they changed the description of the chilaquiles so that it isn't misleading,unless I used to just be blind and dumb (likely). The portions are huge (even the kid portions are very large). And the Bloody Mary drink is still the Queen of all beverages here. Come and eat/drink!"}
{"text":"You walk into this cute restaurant decorated with a real Chevy convertible in the most gorgeous deep cherry paint job ever!!! There is an old gas pump and Coca Cola refrigerator,  and an old Chrome Dinette with those chrome chairs! !
     Then there is the FOOD -- OMGOSH.!!! Hubby had the tuna on 7 grain bread -- so fresh and lots of it!! I had the Bacon Blue Burger.  First off, I can not even describe the taste sensation on the very first bite -- WOW! ! Grilled to perfection on the outside and pink inside,  and the juice just dripping, I mean dripping with pure yummiest! ! Best burger around!!!
      And the staff is sooo sweet, very warm and friendly,  and eager to talk about the food and the place. Love it!!
      They gave us a breakfast menu to check out, and boy, we ARE coming back to check that out for sure!!!
      GO, walk, RUN here,  your mouth will thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie was great. Service was a little slow but I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Food is really good and big portions. Rainy was our server and our bartender. She makes the best Bloody Mary!!!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I'm not sure how service could be worse than at Heart and Soul Cafe.  Heart and Soul?  You've got to be kidding me - this place is seriously lacking in both.  Two visits and never even managed to get food either time.  The food looked promising, and the good reviews (despite the service complaints that other reviewers noted) encouraged us to give this place a second chance.

First visit was in October for lunch sometime after 11am.  We were sitting at a table for at least 20 minutes with nary a glance from a waitress or waiter.  When she finally arrived, we were told that it was still breakfast and they weren't serving lunch... so we bailed because we already had breakfast a few hours prior.  No lunch after 11am?  Annoyed after waiting 20+ minutes to find that out.

Second try a week ago.  Arrived about 10am for breakfast on a Saturday and was directed to a seat by a busboy.  Once again we sat for a minimum of 20 minutes, and I should have been tipped off with what was to come when none of the tables around us even having been served drinks. I did notice the couple next to us with two children absolutely seething when we walked in.  Finally, they gave up waiting for service and left abruptly.  Seeing them walk out the door, someone (the manager I'm assuming) confronted the waitress and asked, \"Come on!  Did nobody take care of them?\" to which she replied, \"I thought so-and-so had that table!\"  

The waitress then rushes over and throws (yes, THROWS... making noise... incredibly rude) the abandoned silverware and single menu onto our table and stated in a very annoyed tone, \"I'll be back with more menus.\"  Frankly, we're pretty easygoing so I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she would come back with a new attitude after taking a deep breath.  Wrong!   No only did she throw manhandled silverware (remember, there were two kids at the prior table sitting for a long time with nothing to do), wrinkled napkins, and a single menu onto our table - SHE NEVER CAME BACK!  We waited another 5 minutes or so (attempting to share a single menu with 4 people) and she didn't return.   

I have to say that this was the most stressful restaurant experience I have ever had.  Will never return and will tell anyone in Cave Creek who will listen what an awful experience I had."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me for the fried chicken so my husband and I stopped in for lunch -- it was 12:04pm on Saturday October 7. The bar top was dirty with salt & dirty dishes-- we sat there awhile before anyone acknowledged us -- one if you employees came by and wouldn't even make eye contact!! When someone finally appeared & spoke to us, I had to ask her to clean off the bar. That seemed to piss her off...then she gave us a breakfast menu. When we asked about lunch, she rudely informed us lunch didn't start until 12:30. Needless to say we left. We would have probably stayed and had a beer until your lunch started if we had not been treated so rudely and the place had not been so dirty. I'm not sure I would come back"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.  Waitress was very nice and was accommodating.  Ordered an omelet.  Was dry, overcooked, no flavor.  Even after putting hot chili sauce... which had no flavor either.   Coffee was not the best either."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast choice! We had a short wait, great service, good food! My son said this was the best corn bread he's ever eaten! The biscuits and gravy had a little kick. The steak and eggs came with a real cut of steak, not the thin breakfast steaks you usually see. Overall, this was a great breakfast visit!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. After five minutes of waiting, the blonde lady appeared. She asked for our drink order. We tried to place a drink and breakfast order, she immediately corrected \"she does drinks only\" and walked away.

Not sure if we ever had a server, the manager came over and took our order. The food was good. But the lack of being greeted by a server or having someone over our table felt a little foreign."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my experience here today. Went to breakfast at this location and called ahead to let them know we had 16 people to ensure they could accommodate. Most of us were traveling and let them know early on that we had to be in and out within an hour and they seemed very understanding.

Unfortunately, after our orders were taken and our drinks set down our server seemed to disappear. Periodically we had different waitresses pop in and our food did not come to the table for an hour 15 after we ordered! Half of our party had to grab Togo boxes and leave cash on the table as plates were set down to catch their flight. In addition, I requested no meat on my food as I am a vegetarian and my burrito had pork all over it however, I was afraid to say anything because we didn't have the time to wait any longer. To make matters worse, as one of the staff dropped off the last plate she said \"be nice to your waitress\". Not entirely sure who or what she was referring to but we were nothing but patient and respectful.  There was never an apology for the delay or a thank you for our patience.

Pretty disappointed this was my last experience before leaving AZ and have zero intentions of coming back.

I was a server for 5 years and many of the other at the table work in the restaurant industry and we have a lot of respect for this kind of work. But, this was by far one of the worse service experiences we ever had.

**side note 20% gratuity was added with out communicating to the group when typically it should only be 15%-18%.  Food was great but service made it not worth the $400+ tab"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise :) we went here for the first time recently and were greeted by a welcoming host.  The menu has a great selection of a variety of breakfast staples (some paired unusually with others!)  I had the biscuits with pork green chili and sausage gravy, while she had the pancakes and eggs.  I started out with a hot chocolate, which was really the only disappointment of the morning - felt like a package deal instead of homemade like the rest of the menu.  As far as the main course, just amazing. The pork green chili was a little spicy, but not too much! The pancakes and sausage were wonderful.  And best of all, the bill wasn't too bad! 

Great place for breakfast, bring a group and your appetite. We'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Great bloody Marys though sorely overpriced.  Service was a bit awkward but the biscuits and gravy were tasty."}
{"text":"Really really wanted to \"LOVE\" this place...and at first we had hope...then it went south and never returned.

Staff greeted us and sat us immediately on the patio as we requested.  Walking by...other guests' food looked decent.  Not exciting but it's breakfast so we weren't concerned.

We were seated...and then....nothing.  Took two times asking to get coffee.  Never got spoons to stir our coffee.

Guests next to us had to ask three times for a spoon as well.

There are a TON of items with 'pork green chili'.  As lovers of pork green chili...we had to try it.  We also love good biscuits n gravy...so tried those too.  

We had to continually ask for coffee - which was the WORST coffee ever but we were tired and needed the caffeine!  

The coffee tasted bad and it also tasted as though they never clean the equipment....nasty. 

Our breakfast arrived, still no spoons....

The food was - blah.  

The steak was decent but over cooked (the server and I even discussed 'medium rare' and the definition so I know she understood my order).  Everything was 'cool' not hot.  The potatoes weren't freshly removed from the skillet / cook top; the eggs had obviously been sitting for a while...

And the biscuits n gravy.  BOO.  Biscuit was rock hard - no flavor.  The gravy came from a can.  YUK.

The Pork Green Chili was from a can as well....two pieces of 'pork' were located ...thats all.  

Even on the Wet Burrito....with what should have been hot, pork green chili....the pre-packaged, shredded cheese wasn't even melted.  

Fast forward to - sprinkling salt & pepper on everything (cuz it was so boring).  The pepper top pops off and a bottle of pepper lands on my eggs n steak.  BOO. 

Server comes by and sees:

Two napkins covered in pepper, my black eggs & pepper shaker and top and pepper everywhere.

Her response was good:  she offered to get two new eggs....but walked off without TOUCHING the mess on the table!  Just left it there....unbelievable.

It took us 20 minutes to get our check/pay the tab and get our card back.  They were semi busy but had plenty of staff.

While we were sitting, another server came by.  He had jeans with HUGE holes in the front and back...his undershorts were showing in the front; he had a dirty hand towel tucked in his front belt and overall looked like he belonged in the back cooking or something.  Not appropriate for serving.

What's amazing to us is ....when we first arrived, we told our server we checked in on Yelp.  Why we had the VERY poor experience we had is beyond our comprehension.

Sorry guys...this was not fun or good."}
{"text":"We go to this place for breakfast every once in a while on a Sunday morning. We sat on the patio the first 2 times. Once inside. My order is always wrong and it took almost an hour to get food each time. After our first visit, I gave the benefit of the doubt so we gave it another try figured maybe it was just an off day. We sat inside this 3rd time on a Monday and it wasn't busy at all, food was fast but my order was still wrong. I would reluctantly recommend this place. It's too bad because it's a neat sit down place with a patio and so close to home. Also, the patio was dirty when we were there. There was even a pile of broken glass next to one of the tables!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned place to get breakfast. We love it. Rather than me having to use every pan in the house to cook a hearty breakfast, we come here. Everyone gets what they want and I'm not spending the morning washing dishes. Eggs and bacon or pancakes and waffles, it's all delicious and affordable for a family. Best kept secret in town."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best breakfast place in town. The atmosphere is very relaxed and chilled. They have a car booth in the middle of the restaurant and cool random things all around such at a gas pump, water buffalo head, and much more. They huge menus for breakfast,  lunch, and dinner. Our waitress, Susan,  recommended the Crazy Cowboy and it was out of world. Thanks, Susan for the great recommendation and service! My friends got the basic and the works omelette and they were very good as well. If you haven't been to the Heart and Soul Cafe you must make a visit."}
{"text":"After hearing about Heart and Soul Cafe from friends we decided to try it for lunch.  Will probably try again for breakfast.  We each had a sandwich tuna salad sandwich was a little bland. Wouldn't rate worst or best.  Would try something different next time.  I had a Turkey BLT,  it was in lightly toasted thick bread not over toasted still a little soft.  Very tasty turkey and bacon.  Both sandwiches came with crinkle potato chips and a pickle.  Good sandwiches but nothing that put them over the top.  Service was pretty good and always had plenty of water and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the pancakes which are very big. Also omelets are delicious and huge. Service is great and waitress really enjoy serving you. Try sitting in the car in the middle of the room. Have been there many times and will continue to go there."}
{"text":"So unfortunately I was watching my figure at the time that I ate here. Luckily, I decided to order the most unhealthy salads EVER. The BLT Chicken salad. 

This salad is probably exactly what you think it is, Lettuce, Tomato, Bacon.... and Fried Chicken, with Bleu Cheese dressing. I probably should have just said to hell with it and gotten whatever I wanted instead of restricting myself to the salad section for no reason.  Either way, this place is pretty damn good. 

There is a hot rod in the middle of the restaurant, and the vibe is pretty unique and inviting. I wish I could have made it in for breakfast, there is some sort of concoction in here that I believe was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, which I am not sure of the name at this point, but from pictures I saw, you should get it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Sat for over an hour this morning and no food. Watched others come in after us,  eat, pay & leave. Waitress never came over to give us silverware or let us know what the problem was. We have eaten here before and really liked it but never had breakfast & still haven't had breakfast!"}
{"text":"Arrival.. Thursday evening saw several people outside restaurant smoking. Proceeded inside and seated ourselves. After sitting there for a while we realized the people we passed outside were in fact the wait staff:) so they came in when they were finished smoking and brought us our menu without stopping to wash hands. They do not have bottled water, so I ask for a glass of water without fruit. Not to hard, I was her only table. I received a glass of water with lemon. I ordered the fried chicken.. Yum or so I thought, until we watched our server proceed dig and dig in her hair, wipe her mouth and last but not least wipe her nose all before she served our food. I only ate the piece of chicken in the center of my plate and did not get a to go box... Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Heart and Soul is one of our favorite breakfast spots in Cave Creek. Great service and the food always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Pretty simple lunch menu, but they didn't have soup :-( Chevy car booth was a nice touch.  Very friendly service.  Grill veggie salad was good, but could use more veggie or salad.  Sweet potato fries was awesome.  Even my friend who doesn't like them said it was great!"}
{"text":"Wanted to stop by based on the television show Outrageous Food! I had the Crazy Cowboy! Based on what I thought was going to be a different kind of breakfast. I am really happy I had it! The Crazy Cowboy is a chicken fried steak, smothered with beans, scrambled eggs, topped off with there chili verde! I was very happy with this meal! Their Chili Verde is one of the best I have had in a while. Daughter wanted to try a apple pancake, very different, not bad. I am just a plain type of pancake person. Wife had their eggs, bacon, and potato breakfast. Their potato's are very different! Has a mixture of red, white, purple potato's with the sweet potato's. Not bad! Over all we had a very good breakfast, if we are ever in the area again, we will come back again!!! One thing! Dude! If you're going to have a night of passion with your lady or guy!! Cover up your neck! Wear a turtle neck or something! Or maybe call in sick! Not something a lot of people want to see!!!"}
{"text":"Great casual place in strip mall.  Looks like one of those places you'd drive right by without giving two thoughts about.  Well make sure you stop in!!   Great casual menu with inventive salads and fantastic fried chicken!  Try the pork chops with Green Chile sauce too! On Mondays all you can eat Fried Chicken!   But the stealth meal here is breakfast.  Sneaks up on you as its too much better and inventive than you'd expect!  Try the Bloody Mary with Bacon!!"}
{"text":"Found this place through a foodie friend.  Food is great.  I've had almost everything on the menus.  Service is great ( disclaimer: if your looking for 5 star service you will be disappointed. Just nice friendly servers who are as attentive as they can be). There is a friendly Country bar attached to the eating area(disclaimer 2: you might here music feed over from bar. Enjoy it)!  Bottom line, this is not white glove & bow tie.  It's good food good service & fun local crowd."}
{"text":"Best Bacon Bloody around! Food was okay, service always slow. Nice place to gather with friends."}
{"text":"Food and staff is awesome! Great comfort food came out very hot and fresh. 
The peach cobbler was wonderful! Tasted homemade!
The restaurant is clean and a fun family atmosphere in the dining room. It was Friday so we could still hear the live music and fun in the saloon. 
Zach and Elizabeth were so great. Thanks for a great night out."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service! Cool vibe, will definitely be back! so many items I want to try but would definitely recommend the wet burrito :)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast wish they had shredded hash browns but otherwise everything is super good great pancakes better than good egg in my opinion"}
{"text":"Been there twice - first time was good, second time was not. :(  Food came out cold and there was a foil wrapper in our food!  Even worse is they barely apologized and didn't comp the meal. Disappointed because I thought this would be a fun place for Mother's Day brunch. Experience was ruined.
Update: my omelette made me sick. :( Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Heart and Soul two times and both times, the service was horrible.  While the food is great, love the pancakes, I just can't get beyond the horrible service.  

The first time we had to beg for silverware and water over and over again. I know what you're thinking and no, we're not high maintenance like most restaurant guests, but simple things, like silverware are a must when you dine out.

Our attempted second adventure to Heart and Soul never really happened.  We sat and waited and waited some more.  After 12 minutes, we were never greeted nor did anyone stop by to bring us water.

I don't get it.  You have awesome food and your establishment could be so much more, so why settle with the horrible staff?  Hire a real front of the house manager, someone who knows operations and have them work out these simple things that are harmful to your business.

I will never go back and it's a shame.  The place has potential."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch yesterday and had great service and delicious food. I had the bacon bloody Mary (yum!) and the chilaquiles, hubby had the french toast. Totally delicious, great service, clean, and friendly. Our server told us they are expanding to make the place larger. I am looking forward to \"all you can eat fried chicken\" on Wednesday night."}
{"text":"The staff (Aimee!) is amazing and the food is always fabulous! My absolute favorite mushroom soup is made by the awesome Chef Alex! I go out of my way to get there on the days he makes this soup! Yummmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. First time and was good nothing special was surprised at how portions were not that large. Had the fish and chips and the spicy shrimp pasta . Would go back again but just average nothing special"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than sitting in a 57 Chevy  eating your meal. Better yet, the food is good to boot! The country music is a great selection and our server Erin was charming and knowledgeable. All the food we've had here has been fantastic. Even my five year old clears his plate which he never does. Great bar atmosphere and also also great dinner experience for families. They also serve local beer!"}
{"text":"Great local popular spot on carefree highway. 

Have done breakfast there twice on drive to Sedona and both time place was very popular and equally good. 

Can't go wrong at Heart & Soul!

Just stoped at Heart & Soul again on way to Sedona. Spending Xmas eve night with my wife & daughter. 

Another trip and another stop at Heart & Soul. The place continues to hit the spot and has great clientele and food. 

If your in the neighborhood give it a try!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  True, I've only been once but honestly between the ambiance and food, I wouldn't hesitate to go again.  If I had to say one complaint, I would have to say that the whole time I was there, I got great device, until I was ready to leave and I didn't have a check to pay lol.  The coffee is a little strong, but that might just be me.  The pancakes are huge and light and fluffy with fresh ingredients.  I had the apple cinnamon ones (I couldn't work myself up to the blue bacon ones).  I can't wait to go back but have to pace myself to keep my waistline :)."}
{"text":"After reading throught the online reviews, I was concerned about the possibility that my guests and I would walk in and have a unpleasant service experience.  I was proven wrong from the second we entered.  We were greeted by a smiling face and the service was good.

Our server told us we had missed the early am rush (we arrived about 10:45am) so perhaps this helped some.  Regardless, our server was very nice.

We took a while to figure out what we wanted so she ended waiting for us to get ready to order.

Our food did take a little time getting out from the kitchen but that just made me even more excited to taste what I had ordered.  It was not a long, OMG wait time at all.  Good food should take some time to prepare, this is not a fast food restaurant so be patient.

My food (biscuits w/gravy) w/2 sunnyside up eggs and potatoes was very good.  My guest ordered different dishes and they enjoyed theirs as well.  I took a bite of the pancakes and wow were they ever good!  The mixtures of various potatoes on my plate was very different and good.  The sweet potatoes included were wonderful. 

I can't wait to go back and try the blueberry and bacon pancakes.  We are all fans,."}
{"text":"H&S is back on track.  Went for Wednesday night Fried Chicken special and food was hot and good, from the Fried Green Tomatoes to the last nibble of mashed potatoes.  Service good.  Filled with happy, smiling, chatting eaters but no so crowded had to wait for seat.  Definitely, last few experiences have been much better...and tastier!  :)"}
{"text":"Great food and eclectic decore and atmosphere. Deanna, our server was super friendly and overall awesome!! What a great dinning experience we had at lunch!!! We will be back often."}
{"text":"It looks like this might be a monthly type of place for me. Being slightly over one month since last visit and with the economy sucking even more, I was curious to find out if the place was still open and if the food was still good. 

Yes and Yes 

I had the chicken salad on wheat, pickle and kettle chips. Oh and the cookie. The sandwich was good size, plenty of substance and tasted great. The kettle chips were good but I am not a huge fan of chips. The pickle was garlicky yum and the cookie was great. 

The staff is really cool. The younger server/hostess is a little rude seeming but I think it is her parents place. I can't blame her! 

See you next month."}
{"text":"We got here late morning on a Sunday around 10:00am. I definitely understand a place being busy for breakfast on a Sunday morning, but that wasn't the case as a third of the restaurant was empty when we arrived. We waited about 10 minutes and got seated and ordered our food. We then waited a full hour at the table after ordering with no food. We had other stuff to do that day and had to just leave money or our coffee and leave without eating. When we left the place was half empty and I have no idea what the hold up was. We ran in to some friends on the way out waiting for a table (again, place was half empty) and told them we waited an hour at the table and they left too. We'll obviously never be back, at least until this place inevitably closes and some new place opens up."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a handful of times.  It is located next to our yoga studio, so it is very convenient.  We sit inside (sometimes in the cool car and take pictures) and more often, when it's nice outside, we sit outside on the patio.  We've been here for breakfast and lunch and have always been satisfied.  The service is always friendly and they don't mind if you stay for a leisurely meal and talk if there is not a line waiting.

I love the Cobb salad here as well as the tuna salad sandwich with almonds.  It came with a homemade cookie yesterday which was a nice treat.

I have to mention that their (in-season) pumpkin pancakes are absolutely heavenly!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times hoping it would improve-but sadly not. Bad service, dirty(bugs in dirty liquid by my table) So so food-- Too loud music doesnt make for a relaxing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times in the past and the food was excellent. Today however, was a different story. Staff was not friendly and the food was terrible. Biscuits and gravy- gravy was cold even though the biscuit was warm and lacked any flavor. Almost tasted like water. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out this weekend.  Fantastic!  And we had zero issues with service even though they were busy so perhaps they have been working on that.  Don't miss the bacon bloody mary but beware it has a bite!"}
{"text":"Delicious grilled veggie salad, battered fried chicken with gravy , nice bar, music, great for families or hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Oh Boy what went wrong? This restaurant is known for really good food. Last night was Fried Chicken night which my husband said was fabulous. I ordered the beef stroganoff and it was a huge disappointment. 
it was a large bowl of watery brown tasteless mushroom laden gravy with floating noodles, and just cooked medium rare sirloin piled on top. 

What happened to the sour cream, seasonings and cooking the beef in the gravy? Honestly I think the chef was so busy with the fried chicken, that a non chef cooked my meal.  I like medium rare steak but not in my stroganoff. I did not complain, I simply packed it up and will doctor it up to my taste,for dinner here at home  I hate to waste good ingredients. 

Yes we will go back as they have great hamburgers, great fried chicken,great fish and chips and fried green tomatoes. I will however not spend $15.99 on something that bares no resemblance to beef stroganoff. It should be removed from the menu. Wait staff great, but she didn't ask why I did nothing more than taste my food......but then to be fair she probably didn't need to."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on the way to Tonto National Forest.  Coffee and service were both excellent.  I had the 'cowgirl' (though I'm an urban cowboy at heart), which was fried chicken with sausage gravy and green pork chili, with two eggs, potatoes and toast.  Yes, this is a real dish.  The sausage gravy was a little rich for my liking.  The green pork chili, however, was out of this world good.  Staff was so friendly making for a nice time."}
{"text":"I am going to preface this review by saying that I am pretty sure my experience was atypical. My parents live in the area and eat here all the time and have had none of the same problems. 

This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in recent memory. The food was fine (what of it they had) but the service was absolutely mind-blowingly bad. 

First of all, our server didn't write anything down. I HATE it when servers do this, especially at small restaurants. We asked if the Arizona Cheesesteak had bell peppers - the server took the menu out of my boyfriend's hand, perused it, and continued to take my order. I gave my order - tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries. The server nodded and continued to look through the menu. After a few more seconds he asked us to repeat our order and then said \"Oh sorry we're out of sweet potatoes\". Okay, whatever, just chips then.

During the rest of our wait for our food we couldn't help but overhear the table behind us, who was having a really hard time with their meals. Their pancakes were cold and had to be sent back and they had no silverware. Their eggs weren't cooked properly and they were just in general pretty unhappy. 

Our server came to check on us during the wait for no apparent reason, saying \"I'll go check on your food\". Instead of doing that he proceeded to hang out behind the bar and chat with some other servers, very visibly NOT checking on our food. A few minutes later a different server emerged from the kitchen with our food. 

My sandwich was fine - was supposed to come with a pickle and a cookie. I asked another (now third) server about the pickle and was informed that they were out. I didn't even bother asking about the cookie - I got the distinct impression that I was bothering everyone and seriously impinging on the staff's ability to chat behind the bar. 

As we were finishing up our waiter returned and said \"So I guess your food wasn't good?\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said \"No, it was fine. I think that was the other table behind us.\" The server then proceeded to sigh visibly and say \"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"

\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"

\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"

\"Oh good, it wasn't my table.\"

My boyfriend and I stared at each other in shock for a few minutes before paying and leaving. 

What. 

The. 

Hell."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there they gave me some raunchy toasts. And I asked for more toast and it was $2.59 for 2 slices of toast unbelievable. I could have bought a whole loaf of bread. Then I also only got one cup of coffee. Breakfast for two is $31 wow. Last time I go there"}
{"text":"I truly love their granola raspberry pancakes. They are so delicious. It is well worth the drive to Cave Creek to enjoy this little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in a small town.  The staff was precious and always accommodating.  I ordered a more healthy option...or so I thought.  It was an egg white omelet with lots of veggies.  I was proud of my decision to keep on track, but it was LOADED with cheese.  However, it was very delicious -- and less unhealthy than most options.  I would go back.  They also have this booth that is made from a car....super cute and an experience!"}
{"text":"Cute diner. Delicious breakfasts. Would enjoy larger selection of salads or heathy options."}
{"text":"This place is so good, their green chili sauce and the wet burrito was do delicious.   Prices are a little high but other than that no complaints and great service too!  Valentino was our waiter and he was awesome"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat breakfast in Az. and its because of the menu. This place does not have just eggs and bacon with toast. All the dishes  are jacked up like jalapeno hollandaise for the eggs Benedict and my fave is the country fried steak covered in there country gravy and then topped with green chile pork and then two eggs and multi color potatoes for the side. I posted a pic of this dish! It is even better then it sounds if that's possible. This place is a little bit of a drive for me but so worth it. The service is great and its like a family place. They treated us like regulars since the first time we went. They also have a really cool 57 Chevy inside that has been converted into a booth. I like breakfast but I don't want to go unless its extra special and this place is it for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night. Once again great service! Our server was very nice. I can't believe how much my husband ate. He ordered the all you can eat fried chicken and I ordered the beef stroganoff (for his second choice) and both entrees didn't disappoint. I can't remember the last time I had stroganoff but I might have to come back soon. The portion is huge. I asked the server if they had my hubbies fav  pinto beans to sub for veggies. No problem! The pinto beans rock! The fried chicken is all off the bone white meat. Easy to eat but I think my hi by was hoping for traditional fried chicken. The live music in the saloon was wonderful dinner music. If they had comfortable booths I would stay longer. Someday I'll have to try the cobbler for dessert. Our tab was $30 including two ice teas. Price is right!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a bite and this is such a cute place. The decor was fun and the staff was so upbeat and friendly. The waitress was smiling the whole time and put a smile on my face. I had the chicken sandwich and it was really good!! Great portion size, I'm stuffed!! :)  I would definitely come back to try a burger. They look amazing."}
{"text":"They must have been reading their reviews! Food was outstanding and service was very attentive! We went on a Saturday, mid morning. They were busy but got us in quickly and brought coffee even quicker (hallelujah!) The waitress recommended the strawberry ricotta pancakes and they were delicious. The waitress was attentive glancing over regularly but not interrupting the conversation. Great experience, we will be back with friends & family!"}
{"text":"I am always skeptical about any restaurant that opens in my neighborhood. Many have been disappointing, at best. Heart and Soul Cafe restored my faith. 

I've only eaten there once and it was for breakfast. I was delighted to see a full two pages of interesting, creative options for breakfast. This place is run by someone who is interested in food, not just selling stuff. I had the breakfast basil sandwich. It wasn't just an egg on a crappy bagel, but an egg with crispy bacon, creamy goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato on a soft/chewy bagel. The side of potatoes was a mixture of white, sweet and blue potatoes. I'm not certain, but I think they are baked rather than fried. In any case, they were not at all greasy and were entirely delicious. 

Service was fine and the place is comfortable and clean. It's the kind of place I'd be willing to drive 30 minutes to visit. All the better that I can WALK there. I can't wait to go back again and again!!! Hope dinner is as good as breakfast."}
{"text":"$50 breakfast for two. 

Average food at best. Not worth the price, and the prices aren't even that high. 

Horrible service. 

Nice decor, clean tables and good overall cleanliness."}
{"text":"BLUEBERRY BACON MOTHERF***ING PANCAKES.

No, seriously. The bacon is INSIDE the pancakes. 

You have never tried anything like this before.

Do it! Go! now!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after a hike in Cave Creek.  The bacon bloody mary was very good and food was fine too.  The food and drinks are identical to the owner's former restaurant on Hayden & Miller called Soul Cafe.  My only objection came with the bill....for 4 of us (one bloody mary drink and one meal each) was over $100 - ouch!"}
{"text":"Great Great food, I love the grilled Vegetable salad, to die for, and just had their homemade blueberry cobbler, the Best cobbler I have ever had, Great family owned restaurant....."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food in a relaxed, non-corporate atmosphere. The new owners are great and they've added a bar with nightlife and live music."}
{"text":"After eating there the first time right after they opened, I thought I would give them another try to see if they worked out the kinks.  Boy am I glad I did!  The service was so much better.  The breakfast was excellent ( you've GOT to try the pancakes)!  We are now a fan and will make this our new Sunday place to go since Kashman's has closed.  
LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last week. The place is great. Wonderful food, attentive service, great Bloody Marys. Can't say enough!!  And the huge portions.... well enough said"}
{"text":"Don't come here when you are hungry because the food didn't come 40 minutes later. Wasn't busy and only  few customers in the restaurant and I still don't understand why the food took so long???

We came 6 people for lunch at 1:30 and we were waiting and waiting for our food, oh man I wish I brought my own food to Munchies while we were waiting.

The waitress forgot to bring a glass of water for my husband and he was afraid to ask maybe will take another half an hour.

The food was OK, it wasn't our good day that day."}
{"text":"Breakfast joint that is ok..nothing special.  The bartender-we like to sit at the bar-seems like it's annoying to wait on people?  This has happened twice - same female bartender.  First time figured maybe she was having a bad day...second time same attitude.  Won't be a third time-food just not worth it."}
{"text":"Have tried this place on several occassions, twice for dinner and once for breakfast.  Always have taken a group of friends, and the consensus is the same.  Dinner was absoluely terrible, and breakfast was good but not great. My dinner guest ordered a burger, and you can do a better one at home on the stove, the bun was soggy and the meat was low quality and fatty.  I had a quesadilla, and it was also soggy and completely unmemerable.  The second trip for dinner was no better.  Breakfast is better, but there are better places in the area for breakfast that are a way better value. The biggest problem is the unfriendly owner, and while the decor is great and there is a nice patio area, the overall experience isn't that great.  There are a lot of places to go in this area that have great service, but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Takes a while for them to notice I was there even after I was seated by a host. Ordered two eggs medium no potatoes dry toast and bacon. Received too hard fried eggs and delicious bread however it has been generously buttered.

$12 I think I'll pass next time"}
{"text":"Waitstaff excellent. We have had salads, sandwiches, burgers and breakfast. All great. Our favorite is the pretzel bites! Yum great spot to hang with friends and family."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  I had the B and S omelet.  It was spinach, swiss, bacon and ham.  Very big omelet.  I substituted fruit for the potatos and toast.  We got there about 9:30ish and there were still plenty of seats open; however, I would recommend getting there even ealier.  Within 10-15 minutes the place was packed and people were waiting to be seated.  I think they would have more seating if they got rid of the big red car in the middle of the restaurant that only seats at most 4 people.  They could easily fit three to four other tables if they got rid of the car.  All in all the food was very good, the service was very good and I think we will return again."}
{"text":"A great go-to place for breakfast. I have been here for lunch too. Both were great! A cute quaint place. I loved the decor the food and the service. 

The breakfast menu has some unique items which makes me want to try something new every time. A good balance of healthy and hearty options! 

I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago.  Breakfast was very good.  Best crispy breakfast potatoes!  The spinach omelet was great.  They have a large dog friendly patio too!  We will be back for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great breakfast omelette. But, man alive - need better coffee. Way too weak. Breakfast potatoes are great though. Great service."}
{"text":"The food was decent, portions were small. But atmosphere was horrible, more bar like than cafe like.  Crowded, went on Sunday around noon and could not get lunch.  The music was loud, went to the ladies room and there were TWO toilets in one bathroom (no stalls) and the music was even louder in there.  

Too bad as it is fairly close to home and with the name I thought it would be more of a clean food kind of place!"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation tried it this morning. Oh my, it was fantastic! The green chili pork, fried chicken, and eggs cooked perfect. No doubt will venture there again. Service was phenomenal but food was off the charts. Well done!"}
{"text":"Apple pancakes are delish, and so are the bacon blueberry pancakes.  It's never too busy and the service is fast and friendly.  It's hard to find a good breakfast place these days in this area!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised to receive my order of pulled pork enchilladas...the two enchilladas were very small and the pork was hard as a rock.  They remade my order, but the wait was really not worth every bite.  I will not order mexican dishes from here.  There beautful breakfast portions are usually worth the wait & price.  Also, my tomato juice was warm.  I had to ask for ice. Very disappointing visit this time."}
{"text":"Came to Heart and Soul with a group of 7. Our friends had seen it on Outrageous Food and decided to try it out the morning after a sleepover (our friends live far, so when we party, we prefer them to spend the night rather than drive after drinking). It was near noon on a Sunday when we got there, and there weren't many people. 

The menu is vast and made it difficult to decide what to order. Four of our group decided to conquer the Suicide Stack. Another had something off the specials menu...something like \"momma's fried chicken.\" The Stack was devoured. 13 layers and it all looked good. I had one of the jalapeno cheese poppers off the top - yum!

I split with a friend the chilaquiles & eggs and the jumbo wet burrito. Both items were made with the awesome green pork chili. It was spicy (an 8 by their rating of hotness), but really really tasty. Some of the chips of the chilaquiles were pretty hard, but smothered in chili, they got soft. Topped with queso fresco...yum! The burrito was filled with chorizo (cooked perfectly), scrambled eggs, cheese, white/blue/sweet potatoes, and topped with the green chili. I loved the variety of potatoes - to me, that shows the true love and dedication of the chef, rather than using generic, plain, normal potatoes.

I ordered the prickly pear lemonade. It was fantastic! The bartender made 2 and said the other is in case someone else wants to try it. I drank them both. 

Although it wasn't dirt cheap, $110 for the 7 of us, will definitely make the 30-min drive again!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday night and we are sick of national chain restaurants. So a stop at Heart and Soul seemed in order.  

It was 6 pm and it was fairly empty. So choice of seating was ours. Service was friendly and relatively quick. My wife order a Flat-bread pizza, my teenage vegetarian daughter, the Veggie Tacos and I ordered the the Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Salad.  All were outstanding.  The Pizza was more than enough for one, and everyone else was full when done. My wife and daughter shared a Strawberry Empanadas which they said was excellent. 

Price was a bit steep for 3 at $77 with tip and no alcohol being ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been to Heart and Soul a few years ago. We did not return because we thought the price for breakfast was a bit high, considering our dollar to pleasure ratio. The food was just OK and did not warrant the price of the meal. We decided to try it again with a group of friends for a Saturday morning \"classic car\"  breakfast drive. We have eaten here last Saturday and again this Saturday.

Positives: Great service, friendly attentive staff - could not have asked for better.  We were seated right away, and after ordering, our meal did not take long to be served. Coffee was served immediately and was spot on. We appreciate a breakfast establishment serving good coffee - Heart and Soul passed the test there.

Last Saturday I had the B...S...Omelet and my husband had The Works Omelet. The B...S... Omelet was bacon, spinich and Swiss cheese. The only thing I really tasted was a slight taste of bacon. Never tasted the spinich and cannot recall even tasting Swiss. My husband said his omelet was OK, but nothing special. We were both unimpressed with our breakfast - it was cooked and plated well, but overall, lacking in any kind of flavor.

This morning, we decided to go to breakfast again with our friends, willing to give Heart and Soul another try. We really just enjoy getting out and driving our classic car to breakfast and visiting with friends. They chose Heart and Soul again as it is in the neighborhood and other classic car drivers also have Saturday morning breakfast there. We all enjoy the atmosphere, which I agree is pretty cool, as we love the old gas pumps and car relics. 

This morning I ordered Roasted Veggies Omelet and my husband ordered Chilaquiles and Eggs. My husband described his Chilaquiles as a bunch of store bought multi-colored nacho type chips with a couple eggs slapped on top. He did say it has nice flavor but he said it felt like he just ate a bowl of nacho chips with 2 eggs and some cheese. He knows what authentic Chilaquiles is - this version was not even close. As for my omelet, it was OK - nothing special. I tasted a little tang from the goat cheese, but really nothing else. Does the cook even season anything? For being a roasted veggie omelet, they used nothing to enhance the flavors of the vegetables or the eggs. It was like eating tasteless eggs and filler vegetables - that is how tasteless it was - on both Saturdays. I make breakfast all the time and I know that adding even a bit of spice, butter, heck, salt and pepper, can go a long way. I am sorry to say both my husband and I are unimpressed with Heart and Soul egg dishes - we were hoping they would be much better.

My suggestion is that if Heart and Soul would re-think some of the dishes on their menu and add just a few more ingredients to enhance the flavors of the food they are serving, they would have some truly knock-out breakfast egg dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I dropped by this little cafe on our way home from the hot air ballon festival. It is a great setup. Very homey, and comfortable.. My daughter ordered the meatball meal on the kids menu... she loved it... my complaint..  All the items on the \"kids\" dinner menu were $5.99.. ouch.  Sodas where $2.25 each..(not included with kids meal)
My husband and I split the mushroom burger.. $13!
 It was a good meal, but it was a very pricy meal for a \"cafe\". We all enjoyed the meal very much, and would return for more if it wouldn't cost us $40+ and have to split a meal to get there. Good, but to pricy to make it a regular place to visit :("}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Came in around 9:30 on a Sunday, was expecting a wait, however, when I walked in there was no one at the hostess stand. The restaurant wasn't even half full, so I figured we'd be able to seat 6 people no problem. When I finally got someone's attention,  I was told it was going to be a 20-30 minute wait. Didn't see why, since there was no one in the restaurant, and asked the hostess if we could push two 4 tops together that were wide open, but was told I needed to wait. So, I put our name down anyway. We were seated 20 minutes later, at the very tables I asked to be pushed together.. and no one had left the place while we were waiting, so not sure what the wait was for. After being seated it took about 15 minutes to get drinks ordered, and the kid COULD NOT get it right. We had to send him back four separate times to correct his mistakes and he even skipped over one of us completely. After 20 minutes of the drink debacle, still not correct, we were graced with our waitresses presence. She took our orders and then I never saw her again. An hour and 15 minutes after we put our food order in, we still had not received any of our meals. No one came to check on us or our food. Since we had been there for 2 hours by this point and all has other plans for the day, we got up and left. Not one apology from the staff nothing. I don't recommend this place to anyone. I wish I could tell you how the food was, but, like I said, I never received it. Never going back and will tell every person I know to never go there."}
{"text":"Tried out this local restaurant and was quite happy with it.  The have really good sausage gravy.   I had The Basic and hubs had Crazy Biscuit.  Crazy Biscuit comes with green chili pork, biscuit with gravy, potatoes (blend of russet, sweet potatoes and purple potatoes) and eggs.  Mine was eggs, bacon, potatoes and I did sourdough toast.  The potatoes were lightly seasoned so no extra salt or pepper were required.  Everything was cooked well and had a great flavor.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"The food was great service was good. Very friendly place. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"This is the bomb! We've been here twice and it was awesome both times. They do biscuits and gravy with green Chile on half. So good. Potatoes are done perfectly, a mix of three types. They do a great veggie omelet with substitution no problem. And the bacon jalapeno bloody Mary is as good as everyone says. My favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We've stopped in for a late lunch twice in the past two weeks. Service has been consistently good. The place is spotless as well.  The food is great! Only complaint, if it is one at all, is there's too much food. Both times we've taken food home. Nice problem to have. This is an unpretentious, comfortable place with really good food. If you're anywhere near, stop in; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive El Norte. Just as the name implies, heart & soul in every bite. Omelet's, amazing. Creative menu. Always packed. Put it on your must try list."}
{"text":"$2.00 Mimosa, biscuit and gravy, good coffee. Portions big. Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Each visit keeps getting worst than the one before it!!! Time is running out to get your _ together!
Hour wait to get a cold dinner? Too much completion to put up with that. Music was the only good thing tonight! Poor waitresses take the brunt."}
{"text":"Decent food but a little pricey. Service was really slow at lunch. Not a bad place to go if you have time."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in North Scottsdale / Cave Creek if you're looking for something authentic and Southwest.

Anything, I mean anything, made with their homemade green chili is to die for. The \"Crazy Biscuits\" are especially good, as are their Chilaquiles with eggs!

They also have what I consider the BEST pancakes around. They have so many varieties, but for me - you won't find a more decadent classic buttermilk pancake than at Heart 'n Soul.

Also try their Jalapeño infused bacon if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there a couple of weeks ago.  We live right down the road but somehow kept forgetting about this place. Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and were amazed at how awesome the food was. I had oatmeal cookie pancakes and my boyfriend had the green chili pork with eggs and country gravy. Both of our breakfasts were fantastic. My only complaint was I was freezing on their patio. There were heaters everywhere but none were on."}
{"text":"We were not going to go here because of some of the negative reviews but when the locals suggested it we decided to give it a try. We sat on the patio because we had our dogs with us and they allow pets on the patio, glad it was partially covered.  Great patio seating outside among the birds, trees and pretty flowers. we wanted to order the omelets but when we found out they do not make them with fresh eggs but rather than use an egg mix which has some ingredients which are not healthy we decided on other options.  The menu is limited when you take away the omelets so since we wanted fresh eggs we ordered the Bagel with basil, goat cheese, fresh eggs, tomatoes and bacon.  It was very good.  The pancakes are the size of your dinner plate and very very light, they do serve them with powder sugar which is not listed on the menu, I wiped mine off as I do not like powdered sugar on my pancakes.  One pancake was big enough, very light and was able to cut with only a fork and tasted good with no syrup.  Would come back just for the pancakes.  Overall nice breakfast on patio with our family of dogs, the wait staff was prompt and eager.  Good place to go for breakfast, a tad overprice on many of their entrees but the pancakes were only $1.99 for one or $3.99 for 3."}
{"text":"I don't know how they are still open. More than once I've waited long enough for my food that I am sure they had to run over to Frys next door for the groceries. I was a dinner party here once, buffet style where the chicken was RAW. I had breakfast once that was puny and not fresh. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich one time, it was not on the menu. It was not remarkable but they were proud enough of it to charge $14, it's white bread and cheese!  Went there for happy hour w gf friends. The server was SUPER SWEET AND HELLA COOL but they were OUT of my beer and most of the herbs to make the fun drinks. Lame!  The waitress chick is the only reason I posted 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary and funniest wait staff. Great place to stop on a Sunday drive or to nurse a hangover!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was slow and not so personable. They need at least one more server. 10 minutes before attended to. Had to ask for water 3 times before finally getting some. The food was somewhat bland . They should also ad ertise that there is a 1 hour wait if you order the suicide stack which was the whole reason we visited. The visit was disappointing and not worth the $100 for 2 adults and 4 kids."}
{"text":"Decent food, good old classic country music playing but weak coffee. The party of 4 were all disappointed in the coffee.  The breakfasts were great and the potatoes are some of the best I've had has there are sweet potatoes, the purple ones, etc.  
There's a great old Cadillac table right in the middle that is a must but you have to call ahead to reserve it."}
{"text":"Their chilaquiles are NOT chilaquiles .... It was Pork Green Chile Nachos with an egg on top. Flavor was good. But not what we were anticipating. We drove 30 min to be somewhat disappointed. I still have a craving for REAL chilaquiles. We also left there about 45 min ago and both of us are feeling the bubble guts coming on. I also ordered a pancake because I heard that they were one of the best in Phoenix. It was flat. I was hoping for something fluffy. I don't think I will be coming back. Another one and done."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday evening, very friendly server.  My H had the fish and chips, they were good but nothing outstanding.  I had stroganoff, it was a very large portion and decent but I prefer the version with tangy sour cream and sherry, still really good and hearty though with just a tad too much sauce.  It wasn't watery at all which I worried about based on another review.  The only negative was it took a very long time for our meals, as the server delivered them she commented that she had made an error when she put in the order.  I wish she would have let us know earlier."}
{"text":"I don't think it deserves the best of Phoenix but it was ok. Drinks are tasty, bartender was Nice. Server quite strange."}
{"text":"Crazy biscuits were delish. Monte Cristo not so much. Wish they had other flavors of jam."}
{"text":"The food is good I love going when Pick O' The Litter is playing 
People are nice its busy most of the time"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing! The Bacon Bloody Mary's are to die for, they make their own Bacon Vodka!!   The Buttermilk fried chicken dinner is all you can eat on Wednesday, all white meat fried chicken with sausage gravy, yum!"}
{"text":"Need to have a really yummy, I'm gonna be bad breakfast? This is it! The bacon bloody will definitely jump start you followed by a unique menu of all sorts of good food! Biscuits and gravy are yum, but we have eaten here a few times and nothing is less than great! Omelets are awesome! If it is your first visit, try to request sitting in the car! It's just plain fun to do! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's a great place to bring your dog and sit on the patio. We love the waitstaff! They are attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast, only to find out we were too late and had to eat lunch.  It was 11:45 am and breakfast finished at 11:30 am.  Shucks, our fault for not asking. But, if you are a restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch and you close at 2pm, don't you serve both the whole time?  I never thought to call to ask, because I've never heard of any place separating those meals and only serving one at a time, when they are only a breakfast lunch spot in the first place. Anyway, that's not anyone's fault, just a comment.  So we ordered lunch, which none of us wanted, but we had a Groupon to use, so we figured we'd just be done with it, since it's not that close to home to start with and we didn't want to come back.  The food was a big disappointment.  My mom's tuna sandwich came out on dry bread, that the waitress agreed with and happily replaced.  You can tell those slices had been sitting out and drying up.  Don't you know to check for that before you use the pieces that are exposed to the air at the front of the bag?  She also said her tuna salad was very dry.  It was a big sandwich, but that's about all.  My daughter ordered a side of bacon and it was shocking.  Cold, reheated, limp and burned. The waitress also couldn't believe what it looked like and happily took it back.  My hamburger was okay.  It looked and sounded better than it tasted.  The bun was nice.  The french fries were fake, frozen, cold and limp and I specifically asked them if they served home made fries beforehand, to which they said yes.  These were clearly not homemade.  We didn't have anything else, as that was quite enough.  Big disappointment after all the kind reviews.  Our waitress was wonderful however and the only plus in the place, hence 2 stars. They're both for her.   I wish we had made it in time for breakfast, I am sure that would have been better, from the sounds of things, but I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Overall a decent place, but a bit disappointing. We'll start with the positives.  
- Large shaded patio with plenty of seating.  
- Friendly helpful staff.
- Good kids menu (the mac & cheese was probably the best thing we had)
- Generous portions and nice presentation. 
- Overall a good list of comfort food

The detractors were mostly with the overall quality of the meals.  I ordered a Blazing Burger.  The burger was fairly flavorless and there was no spice.  They may have missed an ingredient, but it was really bland other than the bacon (the bacon was thick and cooked perfectly for as a burger topper).  We also ordered nachos as an app and all of the chips were so soggy they simply disintegrated when you tried to pick them up.  We ate them with a fork and enjoyed the overall flavor, especially the pork, but it would have been horrible to share with a larger group."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends and we waited literally 1.5 hours to get our food. We got no apology. I don't know what their deal was, maybe it was clear we were visiting from out of town and they don't like outsiders. We were treated with disdain while the person who took our orders laughed and joked with a group by the bar. We saw other tables getting their food and drinks right away. We didn't get our food until one from our group told them we were going to leave, then of course the food came out quickly. The food itself was alright and the menu was creative, but there's no way the food was worth waiting like we did with the awful service we received.

We'd had a wonderful time enjoying Arizona, but I'll never come back here again and part of me feels like the Heart and Soul Cafe doesn't really want me there."}
{"text":"Friendly, kitschy atmosphere (apparently folk LIKE to sit in the car to eat.  I do too much of that already!  :) ).  Animals hanging on the wall.  Food was great, salad was HUGE and very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were handed menus and were told to seat ourselves. The food took a little longer than what we would expect considering it didn't seem that busy. Food was decent but maybe slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Heart and Soul for well over a year. At times the service can be spotty but usually that's when it's really busy. Conversely we've had servers go out of their way for our party. Food is homemade and interesting. Very imaginative menu. Great place to bring out-of- towners. I've been here countless times for Breakfast and several times for lunch. I've not been here for dinner but other friends of mine have been there for the Fried Chicken special which they said was really wonderful."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and I was disappointed with the service, environment, and some of the food. This place is totally confused on what it wants to be. It's an overpriced cheap diner with lousy service. I'll grant that some of the dishes were very good, but the mashed potatoes needed serious help and to charge me $3 for a small dish of gravy that was too spicy for me to eat. I thought it was loaded with bacon bits, but really it was loaded with red pepper flakes! I told the waiter that I couldn't eat it and he just scuffed me off. Overall, bad service and overpriced. I wish I had gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm very torn on how many stars to give Heart & Soul.
I have been here for breakfast only!
The food is great - consistant quality and usually the perfect amount of food. I really like the pumpkin pancakes but they probably won't have them for much longer. Also, the bloody mary bar on Sundays. Food gets 4.5 stars. However, the service is terrible. Its comical. Not even worth getting frustrated about. I'm sure they mean well but every morning its super disorganized."}
{"text":"Good tasting food but most importantly we enjoy the outdoor patio. Receptive wait staff and accommodating too."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here 3 times and it worth raving about! I cant wait to go back, the atmosphere is cool and funky and hip for this area!  Worth the drive. Busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Heart and Soul Cafe has the beginnings of a really good place in North Phoenix. My Chilaquiles and Eggs was unconventional, unattractive AND delicious. The sweet and spicy pork chile was prepared just right. Not having hashbrowns on the menu seems like a mistake since they cook them up for some of the dishes, but the roasted potatoes - containing 3 types - was inventive and good. The link sausage was not attractive at all but quite good. The 'Bloody Bacon' bloody mary may have a scary name but was excellent. The other drinks on the menu looked to be inventive but again the naming is odd. The decor like the menu is a mish-mash of really cool items with no central theme or story. Get the overall message? Hear and Soul is good - but lacks a coherent thread for why we should come back. Why is there a car parked in the restaurant, cowboy pictures on the wall and a big animal head? What does that have to do with 'Heart and Soul'? Oh we'll be back, but to be really successful, creating a story will help spread the good word of this place. So it's worth trying while the owner sorts through all that."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but $65 for r people for breakfast is a bit much when you are just getting eggs or French Toast and coffee.  We had to ask for silverware and didn't get spoons to stir the coffee. They don't offer real creamer with these prices and when we asked for milk to put in the coffee the glass had a crack down the side.  On the flip side, our waitress was very nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and my first time was very pleasing! I got the Italian Frittata and it was amazing. The service was great and did not have to wait long at all for my food. I did end up having a small stomach ache a little while after I left but that was only because of the large amount of cheese in the omelet. Other than that I definitely recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, food and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Live music in the bar. Nice, fun evening!"}
{"text":"Fun place - friendly service and a very \"Arizona\" flavor to the decor and environment. Food was well done - freshly prepared and flavorful. The jalapeño bacon in the Heavenly Hash was excellent, and I would come back just to enjoy more of that! The over-easy eggs were a little over done, although not a crisis. The biscuits and gravy were good, with an excellent gravy. The biscuit was a bit heavy, but not too doughy and the obvious homemade taste to everything was pleasant. The place Is small, so pick your times for quieter hours if you don't want to wait - we came at 11am on a Wednesday and the place was quiet, but was picking up by the time we were done. If you're looking for good, American style cooking, you'll be pleased.
PS - there's an awesome car in the middle of the restaurant that you can sit in while you eat - bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"Came to this place based off the plain fact my parents cant stop talking about this place, plus they have spicy biscuits and gravy. Whats that you say? Spicy Biscuits and Gravy? Why yes, thats beacuse its covered in green chile pork!!!!

Came up from Paradise Valley area to tear up this place for breakfast on a Monday morning. Wasnt crowded at all when we got there, we were asked to pick a table, the one table I like i guess wasnt clean so got denied. Ended up picking another table. Not sure what the deal is with the decor in there, half of the tables are all black and the other half are of oak color. Might be the heart and soul theme I dont know. 

Staff was fairly quick. Was offered the Bacon Jalepeno Bloody mary and took them up on it right away (not realizing it was 10 dollars). Bloody mary was spicy and so was the un crispy bacon that sat on top. Unfortunately either the bacon went into the drink hot or the mix wasnt cold either way entire drink never was considered an iced beverage.

I had to go with the crazy biscuits and it was very good. Plate had 2 biscuits, 1 had the green chile on it with gravy and an egg on top and the other had just reg gravy on it with the egg. Very excellent and had a perfect heat to it. Couldve used a larger portion along with less dense biscuits. Would order again though.

My lady had the bacon blueberry pancakes. It was massive in size and tasted great. Nothing like big fat pancakes!!!

We fought a variety of flies at our table the entire time we were there. Cant really blame the place for this but makes for a"}
{"text":"We hosted a party for 30 people on a Friday for the Fish Fry. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The food was excellent, hot and fast. Service was unbelievable. We have never had such wonderful service. Thank you for the fabulous evening!"}
{"text":"Outstanding bacon bloody mary and creative breakfast menu. Friendly staff and cool atmosphere for being located in a strip mall. I've been here 3 or 4 times now as I visit north Scottsdale and have found service and food to be consistent."}
{"text":"I sat at the counter and had a fitness frittata and added avocado to it...I asked a girl with a long red braid what vegetables were in it, and she acted like I asked her to recite the Gettysburg address...not very friendly! My server, Elizabeth, was very nice though. She asked me what kind of toast I wanted, then charges me $1.75 extra for it. When I asked her to take it off my bill, she did. All in all, frittata was good and fruit was good...but very very pricey for what it was...I walked out paying over $20 for my breakfast, tip included. Not really worth the high price! They added in $2.75 for my small pieces of extra avocado...breakfast for one person shouldn't cost over $20"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, we ventured into Heart and Soul for a mediocre, forgettable but not too terrible an experience.  Last night, we thought we'd give them another try since we heard that they had new owners and had expanded their space to include outside dining.  As we walk up to the place, we notice that the outside dining (which had heaters) was not open.. on a beautiful evening.  So we walk inside and wait to be seated.  We peruse the menu and decided on the Sirloin steak with Blue Cheese.  Our server came over after a while to get our drink order.  It's now 10 minutes into the experience.  I'm looking around and no one has been served anything from the kitchen since we had sat down.  The server comes back to take our dinner order and was shaking her head looking a bit pissed.  When we asked what was wrong, she said that the cooks in the kitchen didn't even tell her that they were out of an item and waited 20 minutes after she had put in that order to tell her to have the customers order something else.  I'd be pissed too - being put in that position by my kitchen staff.  So we ask what they were out of... and of course, it was Sirloin steak.  How are you out of Sirloin steak on a Saturday night at 7 pm?  So we changed our mind and ordered the chicken.  Then the real waiting begins.  So it's now 20 minutes and only two dishes have been brought out from the kitchen.  Diners who have not received their food are walking out, disgusted.  People are being left at the entrance - never acknowledged - so they walk out.  The table behind us (the car booth table) speak to the server - they had been there an hour with no food, nothing.  One of the diners was diabetic and had to eat - they asked for bread.  Which the server did not bring.  Another table stood up to leave but as they did, the server brings them their salads.  Salads -something that should have taken 10 minutes?    The meals were coming out, one or two at a time.  The server mentioned that their head chef wasn't there tonight - that's not an excuse in my book - a kitchen should be able to run perfectly - with or without their head chef.    So we decide to cut our losses - we left as well.  There were only 9 tables of people with three servers when we left.  The only graceful moment was when our server comped our wine when I asked to be cashed out.  During the time we were there, four seated tables walked and two other potential tables turned around and left.  I truly don't know if we will ever dare a third attempt."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Heart and Soul!  

Their food is always fresh, made from scratch and sooo satisfying.  We usually go for breakfast but have been for lunch and dinner as well.  Order from their daily special menu, you won't be disappointed.  Lemon Ricotta or Strawberry cream pancakes - Yum!  For more of a savory flavor, anything with thier green chili in or on it is great.  Also love thier eggplant parm.  An unusual but delicous interpretation.

The only thing they have that I do't like is their jalepeno cheese sauce.  To me cheese is cheese, no need to make a sauce out of it.  Also the service has steadily improved since they have opened. 

Will defiately be back as often as I can."}
{"text":"If I were to rate this restaurant solely on the food and atmosphere it would get 5 stars.  Very cool atmosphere for a diner, lots of Harley and street rod pictures and there is even a '57 Bel Air convertible made into a booth.  I was there for breakfast and I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Without a doubt the best CFS I have ever had, the gravy was loaded with sausage and packed a spicy kick.  It was definitely house made and not a packaged mix like you get at many places.  The potatoes were roasted and had a mix of red potato and sweet potato and were outstanding.  My business associate had bacon and eggs, thick bacon, eggs cooked properly and it came with a nice fluffy biscuit.

My issue with this place is the service.  When we walked in the server was taking an order at a table that had over a dozen ladies there for what appeared to be a weekly book club or something.  We stood there waiting for someone to come seat us and eventually, about a minute and a half later, she glanced over and told us to sit wherever and she would come find us.  We sat for a good 5 minutes before menus came and she came back another 5 minutes later to take our order.  The food actually came out rather quickly to my surprise, and as stated before it was an amazing breakfast.

Now, the fact that it took so long for us to get service was not the fault of the server, who identified herself as Kasey, because she was the only person working the floor and the bar.  I counted 6 guys at the bar and another 20 people in the dining area.  She did a great job considering.  Perhaps some servers called in sick?  They are priced at the higher end for a diner, but the food is very high quality.  I will definitely go back for the breakfast and give their customer service another shot when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love Heart and Soul cafe. The Best service and food. They treat you like family. Even when they are busy they are great!"}
{"text":"The food took a while to come out, but the server was very kind and efficient.  The food was GREAT!  I had the posole which had the perfect amount of kick and a surprising amount of slow simmered pork.  Yum!  My daughter had the pizza which she claimed to be the best she ever had.   We also had the rib eye steak which was good tasting and juicy.  The homemade peach cobbler was also very good.  Great quantity for the price.  Plus the ambiance in this place  is just cool!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the bar had a few cold ones. The Ladies working where great I feel much better about stoping in here."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, large portions.  Pancakes with blueberries and crumbled bacon very good. Chicken fried steak with gravy, potatoes and two eggs outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times. It's the sister location of the other Soul Cafe in Scottsdale. They pretty much have same menu offerings as the other location. The distinct difference is this place has a convertible parked in the middle of the restaurant with seats taken out and replaced with a table. Few times I've been here, that table was already taken. Maybe you have to reserve it ahead of time. 
The food was delicious. I decided to venture out of my favorite pancakes and try the French toast with over easy eggs and my son ordered their chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs. French toast was really moist and delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked with runny yolk, just the way I like them. The chicken fried steak was so juicy and perfectly seasoned. The scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. 
Overall, very nice meal and our waiter was top notch."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been there a couple of times in the last few months. 

Stopped by on my way home for a hike with the fam and had breakfast. Boy was I surprised , it was wonderful. I had  southwest breakfast burrito is out of this world.. So much flavor and good size portion to boot. My wife had the fritata and she said it was great. My son had a biscuit (he is only 15 moinths old) and gobbled it down. 

The service was ok but the staff was young and didint really grasp proper customer service. Not a big deal in my book if the food is great.

I cant wait to go back and have something else.

Later."}
{"text":"This was one of the places that I wanted to go eat at while I was planning my trip, and since it was my last meal before I headed back made it pretty sweet. We had to leave Phoenix a little ways out, but it was worth it. We came across a strip mall plaza of sorts, which surprised me a little bit since the name sounded so quaint it made me think it might be tucked away. We went inside and felt transported with the old gas pump like fixtures and decor. We lucked out and were able to sit in the only dining table with the car. The coffee seemed particularly delicious here. I got the Heavenly Hash, and it was quite heavenly. I would love to come back and try the Famous Suicide Stack! Service was a little slow considering there wasn't too many people there on a Monday morning, so it's definitely a good time to come and not deal with the weekend rush. Prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way to I-17 and we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the restaurant, large amount of menu choices. We arrived at 12:20pm and could have had breakfast or lunch (lunch starts at 12:30). We opted for lunch but noticed other patrons orders of pancakes coming out and they were huge and looked really good. My husband and I had the mushroom burger and it was bigger than we expected and it came with a large portion of fries both white and sweet potato. My mother had the turkey BLT which was also huge, lots of crispy bacon and your typical deli turkey. All-in-all it was a very filling lunch."}
{"text":"Love the salads!! So big and full of flavor! Great affordable kids menu-a lot of food and drinks when you get the chicken strip meal. Cool car table."}
{"text":"Meh. We went there for breakfast. I have heard from others that their fried chicken is really good and they have a good Happy Hour, so we gave this a try for breakfast.

Well, the hash browns are frozen potato hunks that they deep fry and then \"toast\" in a skillet. Awful. The eggs had so much milk in them to make them fluffy that they were not even yellow anymore. Coffee was bitter and the iced tea was watery.

I love biscuits and gravy! But they had to alter it and add green chili's! Really?!? Why mess with a good thing? 

As for our service, I guess we were there too early before the rest of the staff got there. Just one server on the floor at 8:30 on a Saturday. We never got refills until she came to clear our plates and by then we didn't even want them. 

That's when I asked how the hash brown were prepared. She said \"You didn't like them?\" We said \"No\". She said \"Well next time you can have cottage cheese or fruit for $1 more\"

We won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went to Heat and Soul Cafe before going to a theater close to their location. Because of the reviews on Yelp, I called ahead for a reservation. When we arrived (party of three) we were the only people at the cafe. 
The Cafe looked like it would be fun, neat decor. Our waiter arrived in seconds and we asked for recommendations. The waiter was new and only ate a few dishes.
I ordered Beef Stroganov, frankly excited to see it on their menu. (I have not had this dish for a long time.)  The table ordered iced tea. We returned them as the tea tasted that they forgot to put tea in the mix. There is the slighted hint of tea flavor, perhaps from tea made earlier in the day.
My Beef Stroganov finally appeared. It came with a sliver of bread. The meal was so salty that I was only able to eat have of it. 
Based on our experience, it is clear that this cafe must be a morning/breakfast spot. Of the three diners, none of us would return to this location."}
{"text":"It's been way too long since I've been to the heart and soul cafe. I've been here for breakfast and dinner and both are exceptional . The breakfast is my favorite. There is a lot of love on the plate no matter what your in the mood for. My all time favorite are the crazy biscuits , biscuits and gravy and chili verde. I know it's nit the best thing for you and probably sounds \"crazy\" together, but believe me it is the best thing if you are craving a over the top breakfast."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Everything is home made by the chef. Green chile stew had a kick & was filled with pork and hominy. Breakfast burrito with chorizo was enough for two people. My hubby had buttermilk fried chicken with biscuits & gravy. He practically licked the plate. They soak the chicken in buttermilk for 24 hours. Outstanding service from Amy."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the world ! I love it so much just went there for the first time yesterday & I'm in love with the place is very eccentric the feel of the place was great and my waitress Lexi was so awesome & very astute she knew exactly what I needed to eat there thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Great food amazing service! Breakfast is a must and who could forget the Bacon Bloody Mary's !!! Followed by the best fish fry around on Fridays. If you have giving them a try I highly recommend you do!"}
