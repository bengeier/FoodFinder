{"text":"I've now eaten my way through 5 delicious pies, and I'm looking for excuses to order more. Each pie from Midwood Pies has been delicious, and while the way a pie looks should matter a lot less than the taste, these babies are beautiful to boot! (If you don't believe me, check out their Instagram page to see some of the lattice-work... impressive).   My favorite pie so far has been the salted caramel apple, and I'm anxious to try the chocolate chess and some of the other fruit pies.   Apparently they make hand pies as well, which is a brilliant idea.   Hopefully the business takes off because it would be great if they had a storefront- this town could use more delicious pie."}
{"text":"I placed an order for two pies this Thanksgiving to offload some of the cooking responsibilities this year...and boy was I glad I made that decision!    Pies were delivered on time and were absolutely delicious...all family members are raving fans.   They specifically mentioned the pie crust...light and flaky and cooked to perfection.    I am happy to support Emily and her amazing baking skills for all pies in the future.   We ordered the Salted Apple and Coconut Creme.  See attached pictures for the beauties!"}
{"text":"I came across Midwood Pies during Midwood Market. They had set up shop in front of Moxie's on Commonwealth Avenue. Before me were slices of pie just asking to be eaten RIGHT THERE! I just had to choose Emily's apple and caramel pie and I was definitely not disappointed. To me, pie is not true pie without a homemade crust and Midwood Pie's crust is first class. I totally approved (being a pie maker myself.)  Midwood Pies is an itinerant shop at the moment so go on Facebook or their site to find them."}
{"text":"We bought a triple berry pie for My daughter's  birthday (instead of baking a cake). Definitely the best pie I have ever tasted in my life. Super flaky crust, and the flavor of the berries!  Perfectly sweet---not overly so. I'm never baking a pie or buying one from the grocery store again.  (The young owner/baker is Emily, and her sweet husband is the delivery man)."}
{"text":"There is not many places in Charlotte to find a variety of pies, and truthfully I am not a pie girl... but after tasting these pies I have fallen in love with a new dessert.  I love how this is started from a local girl living in Plaza Midwood that was inspired by her love for pies. Also love how she only uses fresh local ingredients, bakes from scratch and uses fruits only that are in season. Being a dietitian this is a huge plus!! I have never also found a place with so many different varieties of pies and amazing flavors. Out of the many pies offered I have tried the following  Peach Pie: absolutely Amazing!! Perfect for the summer. The filling was sweet and the generous amount of peaches were on point. Chocolate Chess pie: probably one of my top favs! If your a chocolate fanatic like me this is a must to try! Never had a chocolate pie that tastes so good. Coconut: one of my other top favs, the white chocolate in the crust makes it even more unique compared to your typical coconut pie. Classic Lemon Cake: Loved it and so refreshing, if your a lemon lover you'll love this! The creamy lemon flavor is filled with an abundance of flavors that hit your mouth at once.  Truly all the pies are amazing but what makes each one even more amazing is the deliciousness of the crust probably one of the best pie crusts I've had for awhile!!?  I will be back for more and with the holidays coming up what more better dessert than a holiday pie !!! Can't wait to try another flavor... I will definitely be back !"}
