{"text":"Lovely little cafe with cute decor and delicious savory foods and smoothies. Comparable pricing--will be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Mostly pretense very little verve. Latte was. bland ...no coffee flavor.                           

The only available eggs were scrambled patties like McDonalds and their bagels look like bagels but are not bagels. They do allow well behaved dogs a plus."}
{"text":"What I love most about this place is the open and cheerful atmosphere, from the cute decor & seating to the friendly staff. Coffee is also top notch & also some delicious healthy food options. The juice bar isn't my personal choice but I could see some health-conscious people really getting into all the different options. Highly recommend - also a great place to head for a few hours of quiet work."}
{"text":"Great coffee at a reasonable price.  Staff is always friendly and most importantly the place is really clean."}
{"text":"This place is great and really close to where I live! It seems like they have a lot of different juicing options, but I always go for the coffee. The ambiance is cute and it's always pretty quiet for doing work. I hope it doesn't stay too quiet though and people support places like this in our neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe; the staff is always friendly and the coffee is delicious. It is also a nice welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. The service was great and the coffee was even better! My coffee was prepared exactly as I requested. The oat balls were amazing and filling. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious \"refresh\" smoothie with pineapple and Oj. Whole wheat bagel with cream cheese and thinly sliced apples. Service was friendly and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I come here religiously after walking at Hartwood Acres. The staff is delightful, the coffee excellent, and the variety of smoothies, juices, sandwiches, and pastries is good and ever changing. I like the veggie quiche--they change the recipe weekly! Great, sunny ambiance, a nice focus on healthy choices, and really fast Wifi! Clean restrooms, too!"}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem for anyone in the Allison Park, Dorseyville, and O'Hara areas. It is quiet and comfortable, with tables and chairs, a couch, and even stuff to keep kids occupied. The coffee and food are fantastic and reasonably priced. I would go out of my way to visit again!"}
