{"text":"Horrible service! I went to the bar my first night and although the bartender was nice, they were obviously short staffed and I wait about 15 minutes just to pay my bill. I spent about an hour at breakfast after only ordering eggs and oatmeal, which I ate in about 10 min. Surprisingly they did comp my meal. Finally when I walked in for lunch I had to wave down the server and he said \"I be with you as soon as I can\" with an obvious attitude. I would have gone somewhere else after the first night but I didn't have a car and it wasn't convenient to go anywhere else. Food is pretty good overall. I would expect much better service from a Hilton restaurant."}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel for a conference. I ate lunch and dinner. My sandwich for lunch took almost 40 minutes to get. I passed the time listening to one of the bartenders tell the other all about an annoying customer. The Chicken was tough too. The dinner took even longer even though the place was half empty. It would take less time to walk somewhere else and the food would be better. Hotel was great, but this place is terrible."}
{"text":"In town on business,  got into the hotel late so decided not to venture out and hit the hotel bar.  There are only a couple positive things I can say,  it has a warm decor and the bartender was very apologetic.  This is not a big establishment, two staff personnel, which I think is adequate for the size. However,  the service was extremely slow. It took at minimum 5 minutes for summertime to acknowledge I was even sitting at the bar. The bar tender didn't know the beers on tap,  which were only 8 beers.  It took another 10 minutes to get a menu.  Oh another positive,  the food came out pretty quick.  Downside, it wasn't good.  I had the Hall of Fame sandwich, which is basically a french dip. The roast beef was dry not much to be desired as far as taste.  Shortly after I started eating I finished my beer. My beer stayed empty through my whole meal and 10 minutes after."}
{"text":"Great little bar with excellent grub.  Judy and Jane were fun to chat with!  Down to earth and quaint environment!"}
{"text":"Had an older woman bartending. She was friendly but the food was lousy. My mom and I ordered a pizza and looked like it was a frozen pizza that wasn't fully cooked. This bar is in a DoubleTree Hotel. I would think the food would be better."}
{"text":"Salmon was very good. One of us had linguine as a side and the other had veggies. Also had the Godfather which was tasty."}
{"text":"Great food, moderate priced  Friendly service, not a fancy place the bartenders and wait staff are underdressed even a bit sloppy but the service and food is very good"}
{"text":"Stayed in the Double Tree and enjoyed a really good meal here! Got the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Fresh greens, flavorful dressing & delicious slice grilled chicken. Had the Creme brulee which wasn't too bad, a little sweet & runny but definitely not bad. Wife got the Cobb salad & really enjoyed it. She had the New York cheesecake with raspberry sauce. Enjoyed it very much. Although we paid well above the menu price because we ordered room service, we enjoyed the meal & the portion size."}
{"text":"Crap service, crap attitude from the bar tender, he clearly did not want to serve us. Was told over an hour for food 15-20 min before he would even take our order had to go to the host stand for menus not even very busy, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Not a place I would spend money at again.  Service was slow, the place was a mess when I walked in and they were out of pretty much everything I wanted to drink (alcohol wise, I attempted to order 3 different things).  The food wasn't bad but but I never received any silverware or napkins.  There were only 2 people working and they both appeared to be too busy to refill drinks or see if i needed/wanted napkins while eating wings."}
{"text":"Convenient because it was attached to our hotel.  Nothing too fancy, was good and filled us up for lunch."}
{"text":"You'd never guess that a bar inside a hotel could have such great food, but this place does and although the prices seem a little high (not for a place downtown though) they make it up with their portions. I'm always leary when a place tries to cover up their bad food with the quantity they give you, but this place proves me wrong - good size portions for great food. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not a great atmosphere but really friendly staff and pretty good food.  I had the baked 1/2 chicken, not something that I would normally order but was recommended by the server.  It was excellent."}
{"text":"I was raised with the old adage that if you don't have anything nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all. So - I will start with the nice.  #1. I did not die of food poisoning. In fact - I was able to ride out the nausea and not even vomit! That's a VERY nice thing! #2. The drinks at the bar are a decent standard pour. I didn't feel the price gouging or watered down drink that hotel bars too often are known for. #3. The bartender. She makes me sooooo grateful to have the life I do - and not have to live her pained and miserable existence. Ooops. Guess I ran out of positive before I thought I would!  I ordered calamari, the gals I was with each ordered potato skins. (Hotel bar in Cleveland, OH. They were clearly MUCH smarter than me!) The skins come, and look great. And they were HUGE! The calamari comes - I smell the fishiness five paces before the bartender sets down the plate.  I am hungry, and figure it may be a seasoning in the breading - so I try a ring. One. Almost. I gave it a couple chews - and spit it right back to my napkin. When Ms. Melancholy asks if everything is OK, I explain it is not. And she tells me calamari is SUPPOSED to smell super fishy - that's how I know it's really fresh! And clearly, I have never had fresh calamari before.  Ummmm - WHAT?  As opposed to virtually every other water creature - that smells like the ocean until it's rotting?  Yeah - not getting into a fight - it's Happy Hour and I am on the company dime!  Please throw away the calamari, tell the kitchen it's rancid and give me potato skins instead. I don't even care about the $5 price difference - just bring me the skins. Ten minutes or so pass, and she brings my skins. They are puny. The ones next to me are large russet size. Mine are somewhere between fingerling and Yukon Gold. I look back and forth between my plate and the two orders next to mine - look back at Little Miss Sunshine and all I can muster to say is, \"REALLY????\" The justification this time is mine are from a different batch.   Ummmm - WHAT? Three of my six skins could fit into one of the six skins on the plate next to me. I am told if that's not enough for me, she can bring more.  I tell her this will be fine - I am really, REALLY not that hungry.  The skins weren't bad. They weren't good either. In fact, in a sad way, they were the most amazing potato skins I have ever had. Potatoes have flavor. Cheddar cheese has flavor. Bacon and green onion both have flavor. Somehow - these skins were completely lacking in taste!  Amazing, right?  I ate two of the skins, went up to my room at the hotel and went to bed for the night. That, my friends, was my wild Friday night in Cleveland, Ohio."}
{"text":"After 11 hours on the road, we were ready for a drink and quick food. Eating here meant not having to leave the hotel.   Restaurant was busy and the kitchen was short on staff, so the servers and bartenders were helping back and front. Even a woman from another part of the hotel was taking drink orders (wish I had her name; she was great).  Shout out to our server, Judy, who kept her cool and always took time out to explain the menu and beer list amidst the chaos. She's funny, too!  We had a nice meal (quesadilla for me; meatball sub for my husband) and wine and beer. My husband remarked about the nice tap list for a hotel bar. There were 8 taps, which included two from the local Great Lakes brewery.  Would stop here again for sure."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for sub-par food. The service was non-existent. The french onion soup was Very bland. It was like watered down chicken broth with some onions and burnt cheese on top. The quesadilla was not much better.   I decided i would give it another shot for dinner  (I really didn't want to leave the hotel)  The pizza was good,  a slightly sweet sauce, but I'm a good way. Easily enough for 2 or 3 to share. Sadly the service was terrible again."}
{"text":"Despite my misgivings with my previous visit two years ago, I fell for the front desk manager's assurance that there was a new chef at the helm who had good eats on his mind.  It was unseasonably cold that day (yes--even for Cleveland) so I decided to eat in.  The house salad was very generous, so no complaints there.  I ordered the ribeye steak with the vegetable medley. I received a properly cooked steak but it had to the thinnest cut of ribeye I've ever encountered--less then 1/2 inch thick all around.  The butter sautéed mushrooms were pale suggesting they never saw the skillet and the vegetable medley consisted of two huge chunks of broccoli.  And the \"crisp breaded onion rings\" were not...  And all this for only $54 after tax and tip (iced tea, no drinks)!"}
{"text":"Expensive, limited breakfast menu and bad service (or in our case no service).  We waited 10 mins to be seated and another 10 at the table waiting for someone to bring water, coffee or take our order...never happened.  We left. Ran into someone in the elevator (who saw us get up and leave) who ate breakfast there. He said it took an hour for their cold food to arrive. His wife was still in the restaurant waiting for a manager to complain to about food and service."}
{"text":"I'm glad I ignored the other ratings and headed downstairs for my first meal in Cleveland. Bartenders in ref uniforms does not say fancy restaurant to me and one should not expect that. What you can expect, and will receive, is solid pub food and a short walk from your hotel room. I had the godfather which is your standard Italian sandwich and subbed in for onion rings. Yes, the roll could have used a few more minutes in an oven, but the meats and cheeses were a fantastic combination that was much better than expected. The onion rings were your standard onion rings, but I was very happy that when I bit into each of them the onion separated and I didn't have to naw at the thing to break up the onion or have it all come out on the first bite and be only left with the breading. If you are looking for a dining experience take your business else where. If you want solid food with little effort, come on down (especially if you just got into town and looking for simple and good)."}
{"text":"Food is ok - SO overpriced though. Not at all worth it. Service leaves something to be desired as well."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not equal to its prices. Service was almost non existent. Would not go again."}
{"text":"I was here for a business seminar.  The food was okay, service was slow, definitely over priced.  Waited 15 minutes for the girl to come pick up my bill, never showed.  Considering I had already killed about a half an hour waiting for food that was pre-ordered on the menu list at the start of our meeting and another 15 minutes to get the bill paid, I had another 15 minutes to get back to the meeting.  Took my bill out to the hostess desk and they had a mess of receipts going on and not knowing whose belonged to whom.  Glad I took the route of keeping mine in my possession.  After another 5 minutes of paying my bill, I made it back to the meeting by the skin of my teeth.  Next time, I'll pack me a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars due to the service and the food was good. Waiter was great the the first night we ate very honest about what was good my hubby and I finished our plates. Another day we ate at the bar for lunch because we had no where else to go. Got pizza and salad it was good filled my belly. Not the fanciest place but did the job for us and the people working were exceptional at the time. Rob was awesome!!"}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Doubletree, there isn't much around. I didn't feel like going out so I decided to try hotel restaurant. I had the grilled salmon with spinach,broccoli, and pasta. The salmon was a little dry but had great flavor. The vegetables were cooked perfect and the pasta was al dente. I would eat here again if I had to but I like eating local."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and attentive for our dinner.  Food was good.   Was great to have a decent meal without leaving the hotel."}
{"text":"Food is good for the small menu of bar food. Service was, look around and see if she comes back, horrible. Bartender was on phone and completely ignored us until the server came back. Waitress could barely walk in her flip flops and didn't know what condiments were that went with dish. When we left to go to our room, the server was coming out of the elevator    stuffing her mouth with left over food left on a catering tray from an event or something. Wow!!! We said goodbye to her and with her mouth full of food said have a nice day; food came out of her mouth as she was speaking. It was hilarious. Kinda made my day, knowing she didn't work for me...lol."}
{"text":"If you have to eat here, it is what it is. Dank atmosphere, attentive service, \"just\" food."}
{"text":"The chicken picatta was delish with real mashed potatoes and excellent service. Even with a large group they managed it well."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I had just arrived in Cleveland under less than ideal travel circumstances and was cheered up just by being there, even though I was not a registered guest. A smile can do a lot to brighten a day and you folks did just that. Thank you."}
{"text":"My arrival was late in the evening and it was cold and snowy outside so I opted to eat in the hotel restaurant. The menu has lots of options. They don't have the ability to make substitutions so if you have a restrictive diet, you might choose elsewhere. The steak was tasty and well prepared. The atmosphere is very much a hotel breakfast area versus restaurant.  When I presented the Yelp coupon, they at first asked for a printed copy but later said they could accept it, but it was loaded in their system for 10% instead of 15%. The server was cheerful and tried to be helpful with my requests on substitutions. The do have a separate bar as well which is nice for business travelers, but I did not go in."}
{"text":"I ate here twice on my recent trip to Cleveland. It was raining both nights and I had long days. I want to start with the ONLY positive thing about my dining experience. The staff was so attentive and kind. As a solo traveler, it was nice to chat with them a bit! They are the only reason I give this place an extra star.   But the rest of the dining experience was awful. The weird dining room should be your first sign to run. The first night I had a burger and salad. They were basically out of every dressing. The burger I asked for was not cook how I had asked. I'll be clear- after this meal, I did not intend on coming back.  However, my second night in town it was raining. And I did not want to try a new restaurant in the rain. So I decided to go with a pasta dish, pretty safe. The butternut squash ravioli with brown butter. It's really hard to mess that up-- but that's what happened. It should've been butter soup with how it was served. The pasta was flavorless. All was unfortunate.  Overall, if you're trying to enjoy your food vs. just feed yourself, I'd say steer clear. Unless it's raining... then the friendly staff will be there at least!"}
{"text":"We opted to eat here because we didn't feel like looking for another place to eat. The service is friendly but slow. There was one person there taking orders and cleaning up tables. Some of the tables had stacks of dishes waiting to be cleared. My husband got an Omlette. I got the breakfast Quesadilla. A continental breakfast is $10 and other offerings are up to about $15. The prices are high for what you get. My Quesadilla was good and well presented. However, the sausage was the pre cooked frozen kind. Not what you would expect for a $12 breakfast. It is no wonder that this place was pretty empty. Of course they are competing with Starbucks as well."}
{"text":"I ventured in looking for a lake view and a quality meal today.  the hotel is lovely and they also house a Starbucks in the lobby as well.  It felt like a homecoming and I am not even a hotel guest!  The grill is very clean and a handsome space as far as upscale sportsbars go.  the menu is pretty standard for an unadventuresome sporty midwestern crowd (no one goes to a sports bar for foie gras and short ribs). Simple if fine if it's done correctly.  The whole staff in and out of the restaurant were delightful.  The bartender went above and beyond.    I had a grilled chicken sandwich, while sounding pedestrian it is not.  Juicy, perfectly cooked with a solid char grill taste.  the ciabatta roll is more -like a regular white roll but not quite. It doesn't have that great chew and air pockets. Pesto mayo is divine. Very generous portion and I opted for onions rings (why wouldn't you?)  and they were crispy and no sign of grease.  I couldn't finish either the sandwich or rings but felt very satisfied.  Of course I got a tin of doubletree cookies. Why can't my cookies come out that good?  I absolutely need to stay at this hotel in the off chance I am ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Customer Service completely lacking,  Rude Staff  This restaurant was in the hotel we were staying at. We ate here for breakfast because we bought a room package that includes breakfast.  Apparently they charge $15 for breakfast buffet. It's soo NOT worth THAT! The offerings are not much more than what you'd have included at the likes of Comfort Inn, or other hotel chains that offer free breakfast!   Breakfast, at best, was okay. The coffee was decent.   If you are paying for this (and some were), go elsewhere. It's totally not worth $15/person.  Now onto lunch. We made our way down to eat lunch, which was supposed to start being available at noon. The lady told us \"just a few minutes, and he will be ready\" (in the bar area.) \"He\" was \"John\", according to his name tag. White hair, beard and Drew Carey style glasses. As it was 11:54 and not quite noon, we said ok and sat in seats outside the entrance and messed with our phones for a few.  At 12:10, I popped my head back in and asked \"John\" if they were ready? He seemed annoyed that I had interrupted his watching of the World Cup that was on, and said, \"uh, uh...well.....um, in a few minutes.\"   We spent the next 5 minutes discussing an alternative place, as it seemed they were not interested in serving. During that time, he pushed the door open gruffly. I guess that was his way of saying \" we are open now\".   So, we walked in to get a table and he said,  \" she will be with you in a little while.\" (Talking about the waitress,  I guess.) So I asked him, \"What does a 'little while' mean?\" You know, cuz \"a few minutes' apparently meant 20 minutes.  He said, \"umm, just....how much time do you have??\"  What??   So I told him we were gonna be doing the science center today, and we're just trying to gauge lunch time. He said, \"oh they close at 5.  We'll have you out of here by then.\" I said, \" well, I don't want to be here for hours.\" He then said, \"go to McDonald's. \"  Wow! Just flabbergasted at this lazy guy's attitude. You're at work, are you not? Is this not your job? What are you being paid for? To watch the World Cup?  We would have left, except the boys had their heart set on pizza, and the closest pizza parlor was closed on weekends (found that out last night!) Plus, the, waitress was pretty good.  Another patron came in and absolutely no staff was around. He poked his head into the kitchen area  saying \"hello? Hello?\" No one responded,  so he stood at the bar for a few minutes. It was more than a few minutes before someone appeared, and it wasn't John. It was our waitress, who had our pizza.  It was also interesting to note that on the day of check out, the door that is supposed to be open to show the place is open was still closed 30 minutes after they were supposed to be open for lunch. Makes me wonder if that's the staff's way of staving off working until someone actually pops a head in, inquiring about it.  Went back late that night for a couple of drinks, and female bartender was harried, but kept up pretty well. She was very friendly, and had this part been my ONLY experience,  we might be looking at 4 stars. When I mentioned to her that she was friendlier than the guy from earlier, she commented that he wasn't nice to anyone and that she honestly didn't understand how the place stayed in business during the day because if it. Made me realize that it wasn't me!  Just know if you go in afternoon at least, that the staff just doesn't care. And apparently will encourage you to go elsewhere so they can be left alone."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling I checked in at the hotel and asked what time I could get dinner until as I was not going to get to the hotel bar until 10pm at the earliest. I was told 10.45pm and actually got down there at 10.10pm.  The server seemed reluctant to assist me, and the cook was at the bar socializing with friends, who to be honest... Appeared to be staff (in my opinion, staff should never be at their own bar). I asked if I could still order entrees and was told yes... I ordered and the cook then left the friends to make my meal.  The meal was actually nice, the service was terrible. I felt like an inconvenience the whole time I was there. The bar was cleaned/packed up by 10.15pm which caused me to feel like I was not a guest but an inconvenience. I wish something was open later, closer, and as a diamond Hilton member - I encourage an incognito management visit to this hotel to get things right, it certainly falls short of Hilton hotels standards in my opinion."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was eh and the service was HORRIBLE! Not impressed overall.  I wouldn't give it any stars if I could"}
