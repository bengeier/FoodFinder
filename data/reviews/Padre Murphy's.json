{"text":"Great pastrami needed thousand island though. Sports bar  two sandwiches and one beer 25 dollars.  Smokers allows outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar, fun place good food decent croud."}
{"text":"Went to Padre Murphy's tonight for dinner and sat on the patio.  Very nice atmosphere.  I ordered the 1/2 slab of ribs and there was more than enough food to eat and take home.  The food was excellent, the service from our waitress, Lindsay, was outstanding, and the pitchers of ice water on the table were welcomed.  I will be back if not for the ribs, than to try other selections on the menu as this is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"good food, and good service. But there was an employee in the bathroom stall when i was in there. He walked out the stall without washing his hands. nasty. i didnt think he was an employee till he walked out of the kitchen. It was very unappetizing."}
{"text":"Kilt Lifter Ale from the local Four Peaks brewery on tap.  Enjoyed it.  Always like to try local brews. Came here for their 2 for 1 burger Tuesdag special. Mike Byrnes burg bacon and cheese.  I ordered it Medium and it came Rare.  Not worth making an issue over, but a pretty basic concept to master. House made chips A sports bar with a nice ambiance.  Was doing a good business on a Tuesday night.  Had some windows for off track betting - not something I am used to seeing. Service was a little spotty."}
{"text":"Padre's is a great neighborhood bar. Family owned. There chicken parm is great considering it's a sports bar. Great mixed age crowd. The band Faded Jeans is fantastic and plays here often. Great mix of music. The service is very hit or miss. Either fantastic or totally sucks... No in between. The greatest place in town for St Patty's Day!!!! Try your wings grilled crispy."}
{"text":"Love there margaritas!!!  They need to advertise events better. Went up there a few times it was so crowed but didn't know some of the cardinals were there. I would not have gone somewhere else then."}
{"text":"this bar & restaurant can be good or bad depending what you're looking for. FIRST, i hate a bar that charges me a premium price for michelob ultra. HELLO, ultra is made by budweiser so stop ripping off all the ultra drinkers. this place is known for it's off track betting. they get alot of horse racers in there. it gets VERY crowded. their happy hour stinks. it's amazing to me that they get as crowded as they do with the higher prices. they have no discounted food on happy hour at all. every bar in this entire area has cheap food or free food for happy hour. their drink specials are limited to certain kinds of beer. i think their food and drinks are overpriced.  they do have alot of larger tvs, HOWEVER,  these tvs are hanging from the ceiling. you are constantly looking up at them, so be prepared to have a stiff, aching neck. there is a large outdoor smokers patio with tvs outside. there is a full menu offering a wide variety of food. it's a fun place, but the tvs hanging up high suck, and it's a turnoff not to have a better happy hour. i can go within 1/2 mile and have a much better happy hour, way cheaper food & drinks, and much better tvs. i heavily suggest rt osullivan at 59ave & bell rd. if you're a gambler, it's a good place to go.  FORGET FOOTBALL OR SUNS. IF YOU WANT TO WATCH SPORTS HERE, GET HERE 2 HOURS EARLY. WAY TOO CROWDED."}
{"text":"Roaches on the bar? Kitchen closed at 10;15 PM? What happened to this place? YUCK!!!! Caught a roach on the bar and put it in a glass upside down. No apology, the barkeep just put it on the other side of the bar near other employees standing around talking!! The counter was dirty and there was trash on the floor and under all the counters!! Where is the health commission? I used to love this place but I can't drink and not eat. dui alley is right there and it's only 10:15!! Still very hungry sounds like bad management. Thank god off site betting keeps them alive but damn this place is filthy. They should be embarrassed but I will take my business back Mellow Mushroom where the kitchen is always open and the bar is clean"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Ambience is great for a sports bar that is also a restaurant.  The food is excellent.  We found it through a client that told us we must go.  Excellent advice!  The lasagna is amazing for an Irish place!  The fish blows anyone else away, seriously.  The quality of food and a good sized menu with very fair prices make this a real find.  If you're going for the food and the sports  bar atmosphere then you should dig this joint.  I don't know why Jeff E doesn't think the food is GREAT!  Everyone we take there agrees with this review.  By the way, we have been eating there now for 6 months 2-4 times a week and never had a bad meal, really.  Thanks Padres, we're comin' back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and after work happy hours. Lots of fun but I'd stick to drinks and forget the food. Unless you want standard bar food that's not very good to help ward off the morning hangovers."}
{"text":"Sadly, Padre Murphy's has gone down hill.  Place seems much dirtier than years past and food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Met a buddy here last night... It's a little bit of a hike from my neck of the woods, but not too bad. It worked out well cause it was a good middle point to meet.   I hadn't eaten all day so I was Very hungry and I ordered the \"godfather\" sandwich which has all your usual suspects for an Italian sandwich. I really liked it, the bread was quite good.   After a couple pitchers later we started to do a little off track betting which was a blast! Won enough money to pay for the tab so that was good. This place is really big and has a huge outdoor patio and TONS of TV's   I don't think I'll make a habit out of going because of the distance from my house but I would recommend going here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I understand this is a bar first and restaurant second, but come on!  A bar MUST respect the WING!  That includes serving chicken wings, not pigeon wings.  Although the quality of the wing itself was disgraceful, they could at least put some lipstick on that pig!  The celery and carrot garnish on my plate were not suitable for making chicken stock in a classic mirepoix.  The prep cook must have had a seizure while prepping garnishes.  SHAME! As for the atmosphere... what is the difference between a Scottsdale douchebag and a Glendale douchebag?  Answer: a trust fund.  This place reeks of a summer's eve.  For full disclosure, though, I was there during a UFC fight. By the way, during UFC fights, there is no cover - but they charge extra for alcohol to make up for it."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Whenever we visit family in AZ we always go there. Great atmosphere, fun crowd, good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Apparently this place does not have to comply with the Arizona smoking laws!  They allow people to smoke out on their patio but the problem is that the patio is completely covered and enclosed. Forcing all the smoke to come into the restaurant every time the door opens.  I was sitting inside almost 30 feet from the patio door and the smoke that was coming into the restaurant was so thick that my cloths reeked of smoke and it took my lungs a full day to recover.  I will not be going to this place again and neither should you.  That is unless you are a chain smoker and in that case this is your kind of place!  YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great service from manager Nick H. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with the fam...best fish fry ever on Fridays....Great local place with lots of local beers on tap...Keep the local business going this place deserves some recognition...."}
{"text":"5 in our family went tonight and although the food is really good I need to comment and give 3 stars for an issue I found disconcerting.  As three of us sat down with two who had already arrived and 5 menus on the table I immediately asked family what the horrible smell was.  No one noticed a smell but I commented that it smelled like rubber.  It was horrible and ongoing.  I was just telling my family that we needed to leave and find somewhere else to dine when our server came over and I asked what that horrible smell was and she replied \"Oh, it's the menus, they're new.\"  Sure enough, I was sitting directly in front of the pile of menus on the table.  I asked if anyone else had commented about the smell and she replied no but that she had had to stand by the host/hostess stand for a short time near a big stack of those menus and it gave her a headache.  I don't know what the owners are thinking bringing something noxious into their establishment to bother their customers.  I'm not even sure whatever they coated their new menus with should be legal.  It smelled toxic.  So if you go make sure not to get to close and definitely don't touch them if you can help it.  Our server said the noxious odor dissipates over time."}
{"text":"I usually go to Padre Murphy's once a week and the noon service staff is great, ask for Mary as she is the best.  Last night, Tuesday I went for dinner with a friend.  We got our menu's and were seated in a booth.  Well after fifteen minutes of waiting and waiting, I walked out and no one cared.  Upon leaving I was told to have a \"nice day\" but I told them back that I would have liked to be served.  They said \"awwww\" and left it like that although the Dinner Manager was standing at the bar several feet away.  The bar/dining place was not full, but I guess our waitress was taking a break because everyone in our section was eating, except for us."}
{"text":"Very nice sports bar. Had a blast here. Everyone seemed very friendly, haven't tried the food yet (only had drinks). Definitely will be visiting on St. Patty's Day. Customer service was pretty good. My only wish is that the servers would go that extra mile. I would definitely (and have) recommended this to friends and family."}
{"text":"while on the phone tonight around 7pm creating a large take out order with Lorna, my phone had issues. I called back to complete the order. during that call, my phone unexpectedly muted itself. after figuring out the issue, I said hello dozens of times.  seconds later, I hear Lorna and her coworker cussing and complaining about my phone issues. im not sure why she didnt hang up the phone before starting her venting. I heard the words f***ing b**ch, wasting my time with her bullsh**. her coworker told her to tell me to call back at 10 pm. I would not call back. you serve the customer when the customer approaches prepared to make an order. this was my first and last experience with this establishment. I wont hesitate to share my experience with friends,  family, coworkers, social media, etc. there is never an excuse to be that sloppy."}
{"text":"Went in during the week and place was not busy at all. Sat at the bar and waited a while for service and when the bartender did come over she seemed annoyed that I asked about happy hour and what beer was on tap. I will not be back anytime soon even though I have always liked this place.  I am in the business and can tell you that poor service turns away guests before bad food when it comes to the bar business."}
{"text":"Yeah...great food, but maybe you should get servers that arent so preoccupied with their fellow coworkers/sorority sisters and actually want to service their customers.  Fire your staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times mostly Fridays because they have good deals on beer and fish and chips. Overall I will tell you that they have very good drinks they are not watered down and they give you a lot of drink and the fish and chips is very good. I  give it only three stars because the service is not so much and the tables are ALWAYS dirty- When I mean always dirty I dont mean one time or two time I mean everytime dirty. The management needs to hire people JUST to clean the tables because there is only 8 waitresses and maybe 200 people so it is very busy much too busy and the waitresses never clean the tables because they have no time.   Overall good food good drinks the service not so much"}
{"text":"This place is fun..frantic..and I especially love the karaoke on Wednesday nights !! it's a great sports bar, lots and lots of TV's everywhere with off track betting !! the food there is really good..the atmosphere is great..and the staff is top notch !! also, before the karaoke on wednesdays, there is trivia !! very few places have that...it's just an all around fun place to go to watch sports, bet, sing karaoke, shoot pool, eat and just generally relax and have a good time !!"}
{"text":"Had to meet someone here. Still lousy attitude and no respect for the customers.  I guess the OTB keeps them in business.  No way will I be back.  Too many other ways to spend my money.    Did speak to the manager about the food and service, they could absolutely care less."}
{"text":"This is a great place for sports watching!!  Tons of televisions so you can see from anywhere in the bar.  The food is just average although the grilled wings are pretty tasty.  Beers were reasonably priced and service was great.   They even had a free raffle that my husband won Cardinal's tickets from!   This place is a long time favorite of my husbands and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO ST PATRICKS PARTY  No signs post that the entire place is CASH ONLY. They conveniently have $7 fee ATMs though... Will never be returning to this horrible price gouging establishment. Mostly guys anyways so don't go looking for girls either... Yikes!"}
{"text":"We had not been here is a very long time and decided to eat here since we were in the area.  NOT the best experience in the world.  Kristin or Christine (long blonde hair) the hostess who was also our server had some kind of attitude. Maybe its her young age. We both ordered alchoholic beverages and when they were empty she never asked us if we wanted another one... too bad because we wouldve gladly paid for another round.. The spicy bloody mary was YUMMY!  I ordered the Philly cheese steak.. it had ZERO flavor, but the french fries were good. My husband said his burger was pretty bland too.  This place used to be really fun and a great place to eat. I guess my advice is would be is to go here if your just want to drink, watch TV and do off track betting. I sure hope you get a better server."}
{"text":"I go to here a few times a week, I've never had a bad experience. Love the fish on Friday. The entire menu is good. Pastrami sandwich with Raspberry sauce delicious. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I usually ask for Taylor, she's so friendly and attentive I don't think she ever has a bad day. And you never know, I like to wager a couple of bucks on a dog or horse race now and then. Might win enough to pay for dinner.good luck..."}
{"text":"Better than average bar food ....service isnt the greatest but its all about the off track betting here ..... Lots of tvs and if its the dogs or horses they got windows for them both ...... As far as off track betting goes its one of the better ones in northwest valley ...."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since we have been here. It was \"quite\" busy for a random Thursday...so gotta send a shout out to our waitress Heather...we would for sure sit in her section again on our next visit. \"However we were disappointed in the $3.99 for 1 pretzel and they had\"No\" poppers that were listed on the Happy Hour menu!!!\""}
{"text":"As with most bars the service tends to be hit or miss but the food is nice and greasy.  All and all not a bad place to hang out.."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I moved to Phoenix for the all you can eat Friday fish fry.  Well as they say in New York forget about it because it's no longer an all you can eat do on Friday nights .  Now their a new policy is to give you 6 very thin and small pieces and if you want more its 2.25 per piece after that!  I opted out and now I go to Santisi Brothers."}
{"text":"Service was great- food was okay- they have Off Track Betting- always a good time- would be a five star review BUT the restaurant has a musty \"bar rot\" smell-"}
{"text":"Love the fish fry best ever live betting on horse race great football bar too overall a very nice  place"}
{"text":"I just can't get this visit out of my head.  I can only give it any stars because I chatted with the owner Tom and he was amazing, friendly and offered 2 more shots on him but we declined because we already had enough.  Tom is a very nice man.  One afternoon my friend & I had lunch and a few margaritas and tequila shots.  As we take each other out to lunch now and then and take turns paying & this time it was my turn to pay. The waitress was not friendly at all & more like snickered, didn't smile even once but we looked past it best we could.  I spoke with the owner (Tom) who was walking by.  I told him we couldn't taste the tequila in our drinks that's when he offered to buy the next two but we already had enough.    Just before leaving I realized my shot glass was filthy looking like someone rubbed their greasy finger all over the inside of it.  I'm sure it was a dirty glass before filling it, when I received it I hadn't noticed it yet.  The manager was kind enough to bring my friends walker out to her.  We will never ever go back.  The waitress even charged us $10 for just two small shots of tequila; felt really horrible upon leaving, but not a service any guest should ever receive anywhere.  But the owner is terrific so I feel horrible about giving this review but I just can't get over it.  It was just wrong.  We're really sorry Tom."}
{"text":"Padre Murphy's has been a well-known sports bar venue on 43rd Avenue & Bell for many years now, and many know that it is the place to be for St. Patrick's Day, Kentucky Derby Day, and the Super Bowl starring the trumpet of Dr. Jesse McGuire.  I've been coming to Padre Murphy's for many years now, and recently I found out about yelp.com, so I figure it's due to time to give some personal  feedback....here goes:  First, if a sports bar environment and the number of TV's is important to you, then Padre Murphy's is second to none.  As I understand it, they have a few HDTV package options (DirecTv & Cox Communications) in order to offer nearly every conceivable television sports program that you could possibly want to see in Arizona.  Second, let's take a quick look at the menu and the food served at Padre Murphy's.  From my experience, it is a mixed bag.   I strongly believe that years ago the quality of food and the creativity of the dishes were much better.  For some reason over time, I've noticed some complacency and plainness with most of the meals.  Often times, what I order lacks a whole lot of taste or any type of spices, whatsoever.  Also, often the mashed potatoes and vegetables of the day mimic that of what you may get at a Hometown Buffet type restaurant.  I think an adding of some butter, sour cream, garlic, and chives to jazz up the mashed potatoes and maybe adding some fresh cracked pepper or something for the vegetables would be a needed change.  Also, it's always bugged me but if this is indeed an Irish sports bar, then why does the menu and daily specials not reflect that?  For example, the daily specials are spaghetti and meatballs, hamburgers, etc.....why not have more of an Irish menu such as Steamed Mussels, Lambs Shepherd's Pie, Meatloaf, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and a hearty Irish stew as either specials, or menu items?  How about a few Irish draughts as well?  Also, what about some bar specials....most places have $3 \"U Call It\" at some time during the week?  What about an \"Industry Night\" for others in a similar business?  Third, people will often come in to a restaurant solely for the entertainment value, if it is good enough.  I find myself attending weekly during Wednesday's nights trivia and karaoke, with host Tao Baker. He is, without a doubt, a major strong point of the weekly entertainment schedule at Padre Murphy's. He has an up-beat and cheerful demeanor with the customers and staff and has an ability to entertain like few others. Now, when it comes to Friday's entertainment, Name That Tune....all I can say is that host Patrick is a bit to over-the-top and vulgar at times and that the game gets monotonous after a while.  Next, let's talk about the periodic bands that perform at Padre Murphy's.  I think some diversification of music styles would be beneficial.  How about some local Irish bands such as The Brazen Heads, 30 Stone, or The Bollocks.  Also, a few years back at Padre Murphy's, a young performer named Ronnie Winters sang (un-plugged I believe) during the evenings where he covered some more current tunes which drew in the younger masses quite well.  Having him back would be great!!  Lastly, Padre Murphy's is physically is a large place that I believe could benefit from adding an internet jukebox, some dart boards and possibly weekly dart league, and weekly poker league/tournaments.  These is purely my opinion....what do you all think???  As a whole,  currently I would rate three stars....***."}
{"text":"Sandwichs were good ! BUT men's bathroom smells like Raw pee !!! Smells worse than an outhouse almost gagged me, went back out to my table didn't even finish my food"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat and watch sports the staff is amazing and the owners are always nice to everyone that comes in. The Sonoma Salad is my favorite.  There wings are alway perfect. Love going there  when they have Jesse McGuire perform the National Anthem before a sports event. Now we can enjoy him playing music on Tuesday evenings."}
{"text":"Service is only ok.  We sat at bar and the bartender wasn't overly friendly.  We got happy hour food for dinner.  Wings were dry and small, but the sauce was tasty.  We love potato skins, and theirs were very large and really tasty.   Happy hour prices are pretty good. Not sure we would come back for a real meal though, and not sure we would come back with family."}
{"text":"First timer!  I went in for a dinner with my lover. I am a simple girl living in a simple world, so I decided to have a salad. My lover is a prime rib kind of guy, so he got the prime rib. I had a simple water, and my sweet love had chocolate milk, (PSA- they don't have regular chocolate milk, but we begged our server, Kendyl to demand chocolate milk, and she said, she will get it done)!  The salad tasted like a good salad. My dearest love told me to type this about his rib, \"cooked perfectly, very tender, excellent use of salt......the potatoes were okay\"  The atmosphere is very sporty, so I'm assuming this was a sports bar.  The food was unrivaled.  Our server Kendel was sweet, (and although my love wanted Chicken Noodle Soup originally, Kendil talked him into trying the prime rib, and I was the one paying for it, so tbh I was a bit upset about that, so don't tell her, but I gave her less of a tip for talking my sweet love into getting that pricey steak!!!!)  and the prices were on par with what I expected.  Thanks padre murphys people. it was fun. Will I be back? I don't know, I can't think into the future."}
{"text":"Your typical kick a$$ irish sports bar. This place is great. Its good size, with flat panel tv's everywhere!  Solid Irish/American menu with affordable drinks all the time. They also have outside seating and off-track betting! So grab some corned-beef, a guiness, and bet some dogs will ya, you owe it to yourself."}
{"text":"Has something happened at Padre's? 10 minutes to get a flat beer,  menus were disgustingly dirty, waitress could care less (I am sympatic, could be an off day for her). We left and went to Bubbas 33. So glad we did.  Sorry, Padres....."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for years and I must says its a fun afternoon to relax bet on the dogs and consume a few wings washed down with cold beer of course. The prices are average not cheap and the place is often packed but the layout somehow lessens the cramped feeling. Plenty of outdoor seating. I was a little disturbed on my last vist to see smaller chicken wings than I recalled in the past hope they didnt try to cut a corner because they used to be my favorite wings. They still taste good just really small now. I actually think I like the Notorious Pig BBQ Wings a little better now because they smoke them then fry um and they are bigger but its all good here anyway. Waitresses are always very nice and I have actually walked away with several free tabs and some extra money in my pocket after hitting on the dogs. All in all highly recommended for Pub and Grub."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is good, but service is LOUSY.  We were seated but not given menus.  We waited almost 15 minutes before we got the menus.  We had two beers each but had to go to the bar to get them ourselves.  We waited over a half hour for our food and when it came, we had to wait for silverware.  Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"I am torn in writing this review because I have been going to Padre Murphy's for years without issue but my last visit really disappointed.  My husband and I both ordered burgers for lunch - I got the party melt and he had the mushroom burger. I have ha these before and they were always delicious so I thought it was a sure fire bet.  We both ordered are burgers medium well. When the food came out, it took the waiter a long time to check on us - I ended up calling him over. My burger was very dry and the party was swallowed up by the bread and bland fried onions. It was also cooked well done, but I didn't feel like waiting for another burger because we had our daughter with us. I didn't say anything to my husband but asked for ketchup for the burger. Then my husband mentioned that his burger was dry and overcooked and he didn't want to eat it so we called the waiter over again. At this point, I kindly reminded him that we had ordered our burgers medium well and these were clearly well. He then started arguing with me. He said if I wanted it slightly pink I should have ordered it medium rare! I told him my experience has always been that slightly pink was medium well. Nonetheless, we asked for a new burger for my husband. By the time it came out, we needed to leave so we asked for it to be put in a box. It was - and with nothing else - no fries or anything. We didn't get an apology, we didn't talk to a manager and we didn't get a discount on the bill. The only thing that really bothered me was the arguing... After all, it's not the waiters fault if the food is overcooked.  One last thing - I ordered a tall mixed drink and got a short instead... Minor but relevant.  This was the first time I've been really disappointed here but it was enough to make me write a review. Normally the food and service is great and we love to be able to take part in OTB. Let's hope it's better next time!"}
{"text":"This was the mother of all sports bars. Now food and service have gone down hill. They need a new cook and better drink specials. The staff needs to stop talking to each other and take care of the customers. I have been stopping in there for over 15 years but will look for another watering hole!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Bartenders are awesome and this place is just really fun! Food is awesome!  Drinks are really good! And its at a great location! Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place blows. Was really looking forward to it too. No one greeted us or said anything as we walked in. At at our table for almost ten minutes before a waitress showed up. I ordered a \"loaded root beer\", a root beer based cocktail on their liquor menu. The waitress ended up bringing me a \"not your father's\" root beer. When she finally returned 20 minutes later to take our order, I corrected her in my drink and she still didn't get it. Tried to tell me I'm thinking of a root beer float. I had to pull out the menu and show her. She came back and confirmed I wanted the ice cream, which doesn't come with it. She STILL thought I wanted a root beer float. 25 minutes into my visit, I finally got the correct drink. 45 minutes in our entrees showed up, but we ordered an appetizer!  Guess that was out the window, the waitress never even wrote it down. At this point she left and a better waitress took over but that was too little too late. I got the Irish flat iron and it was terrible. It wasn't seasoned at all, had a grizzly line of fat through the middle (usually found in cheap steak), and the cheese that comes up top was slumped to the side covering maybe 25%. Had to try and salt and sauce it to hell to make it taste good. Fries were basic and lukewarm. Only thing good was the beer my dad got and how can you really mess up getting a beer from the bar? That's about all that server was good for. Crappy experience and I'll never go again and I suggest you don't waste your time either."}
{"text":"Padres has the best non-traditional wings in town. Get a side of skinny fries and you have the best meal. They have a ton of Arizona beers on tap. Off track betting if thats your thing too"}
{"text":"Best Bar/restaurant in the Valley!  Great staff, good food, and there is always something to do which is good for ADDers."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights are the best night to go to Padre Murphy's. THE one and only, Dr. Jesse McGuire is playing his sweet smooth trumpet and serenading you with his honey-like voice. I think he's there 5:30-8:30 every Tuesday evening. You will NOT be disappointed if you're a lover of music. While listening, of course you can get a Achocolypse chocolaty tasting beer and a big savory salad or burger. The happy hour menu is in full swing about that time too, so have at it! If you're wanting just sit outside sometime to \"chill\" the patio is very large. Restrooms are always clean, wait staff is friendly, but not overly hovering. It's just a cool place to hang out, especially Tuesday evenings. See you there!"}
{"text":"Well I'm sorry to say...I did not expect NO more FRIDAY ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH!! I'm not as disappointed with not being able to order extra fish as I am in the quality of the meal. First of all when we walked in around 6 pm on a Friday night and there were empty tables we felt that to be strange. There was no more ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH offered...ok. But then the 4 good sized pieces of fish, the server promised came out on a plate where it seemed the fries and coleslaw were tossed on first. So coleslaw was warm. It was different from what we had been accustomed to. It tasted alright. The fish was a bit tough and rubber like. No flavor. The breading was nice, golden and crispy. The tatar sauce was really good. The fries were SUPPER YUMMY!! Were thinking we knew something was up when we walked in....and we're right!! We know Padres has been around for over 20 years...we been going there for that long!! It is sad when good things change....bussinesses sometimes have to cut cost and I get that but we customers don't have to keep on going has gone down. I gave a 2 because I know what it was like when they were a 5!! We will miss you Padre !!!"}
{"text":"I can only speak of the lunch however, I though the corned beef was great! I would never order a steak here or any sports bar but, I been going here every so often for ten years now and I personally enjoyed it every time. We bring the kids and I do like betting the horse races so, that a plus for me.  Anyway, I'm surprised by the bad reviews, but then again I only visit 2 or 3 times a year and have never been at night or for a specific game..."}
{"text":"Came here for the festivities of St. Patrick's day. Good music and lots of beer tubs available. Only bad thing is two different \"bartenders\" tried to rip us off. Beer's are $7 and on two different occasions I paid for my beer with a $10 dollar bill and each time the bartender tried to keep my change. I actually had to ask them for my change back and got a dirty stare each time. WTF man, y'all already overcharging now you want my change?!"}
{"text":"The prime Rib is killer. Best I have ever had. The have Papago Orange Blossom on tap. Great food great service."}
{"text":"Our server Jasmine was great,  friendly and helpful.  The food was mediocre  at best but we will come back to bet on the horse and drink."}
{"text":"The place is pretty decent. Always courteous, food is pretty decent, priced are fair and it's got a ton of tv's for whatever you wanna watch."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch and it was great. Had the half rack of ribs with slaw, fries, garlic bread $10.99. Wife had The Board and snake bite. Tv's around with multiple sports on and the best part the volumes were off so you can enjoy games and conversation with out yelling. Nice clean establishment."}
{"text":"I actually always liked the food. It was pretty good. But things have gotten way overpriced, and I stopped going there after seeing the place just get progressively filthier...culminating in seeing a cockroach crawl across the bar.   There are a handful of bartenders and waitresses there that are really good and have been there for a while. But they'd probably be better off going and finding employment someplace else where the management is a little better. The place used to be pretty decent, and now it's just a dump."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Huge sports bar, can always get a table with little to no wait (on normal non-Superbowl days).  Food is above average, some things I love, and some things wouldn't order again.  They have off-track betting which is really fun....in fact, this is the first time I ever learned how to bet on the dog races.  Restaurant is also family friendly.  Someone earlier complained about parking....just like any other restaurant, if you get there late, you have to park further away.  If you get there early, you get a spot in the front......"}
{"text":"There was three of us in my party including me. We went during the afternoon on a  Friday and we all ordered the Fish & Chips. All of the food we ordered was absolutely Delicious.  You get a hefty serving of chips along with the ginormous strips of fish, too. Really can't ask for more. My goodness it was wonderful. Unlike typical fish and chips you don't taste or feel that oiliness that you do with most places. The fish had a nice breading on the fish was absolutely mind-blowing and was extremely moist. It falls apart almost to a fault. I am very finicky about fish & chips because I grew up in Rhode Island, San Francisco, Hawaii  and spent some time in England, so it better be good or I'm not coming back.    There is only a few places I like for fish & chips in Arizona but this is one of the best places I've been to.    CUSTOMER SERVICE: The wait service was friendly and quick.  FOOD: The fish was exceptional. Fresh, moist and the perfect consistency. Just how fish and chips should be. I'm salivating as I'm typing this. It's so good you don't even need the tartar sauce, I just used  a tiny bit of vinegar and was good to go. CONCLUSION: This place is GREAT!  I highly recommend for any fish & chips lover. I definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last 3 years.  Earlier the vulgar language by the guest..way outta control REALLY and the service has gotten worst.....tonight we sit here with a table of servers sitting next to us...3 on the clock....are u kidding? One doing shots with the gang..the other pregnant, and boyfriend following her around with his hands all over her. The third..well not much better...sneaking around the corner......not sure why..outside of lack of concern  and lack of management....time to find a new hang out! WOW WHERE IS MANAGEMENT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE DRIVING THE BUSINESS AWAY? Sorry to see the owner blindness."}
{"text":"Our waitress Lisa was fantastic. And I quote from my wife, \"we always get fantastic service but Lisa was on point tonight.\" Friendly and efficient. Thank you Lisa for your excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this is probably a great sports bar it seems like but the service could have been better.  First we had to flag down a waitress and she didn't even provide us with menus so we got to play guessing games here.  Pitchers are now only domestic and no microbrews....if your big into sports sure you'll enjoy the hundreds of TV screens broadcasting your favorite team but I wouldn't come here for casual dining. .."}
{"text":"my favorite thing at padre murphy's is everything!  the 50+ beers on tap, mostly craft... the food has always been good and the service is consistently awesome! thx u padres!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for about 15 years. we have never been rushed. The food has always been consistantly good. Great TV sports viewing, and if we wanted to watch a special game or event that was not in front of us. We would ask and they would change the channel. Waitress's and waiters have always been attentive and nice. If you happen to be a regular they always make a point to call you by name. This is a perfect example of a neighborhood bar and grill. Great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Used to be our go to place for football and fish fry Friday. Over last several months business has slowly gone down hill. Poor wait staff and service. Menu has been the same for years although I saw advertisements for new menu coming but still hasn't happened. Went tonight and they had a trumpet player, a good player but very loud shrieking trumpet player (odd combination for an Irish sports bar) and was expecting a nice quiet evening. Waited ten minutes still no waitress although several passed us by without even making eye contact. Last time at Padre's. Now sitting at Zipp's and was served within two minutes of sitting down, drinks in hand and order placed. Too bad because Padre's was within half mile of our home. Zipp's has earned our business from now on unless there is a major change to the service, food and cleanliness of restrooms."}
{"text":"Great place to wack back a few or ten pitchers of beer and watch the game or fight and bet on the horses or puppies!! they have off track betting."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are awesome i will definitely be back to try othet things i liked sll the tvs they had."}
{"text":"Visited tonight to try their fish fry. It was excellent! The server was nice and efficient and the atmosphere was good. Music was not too loud and there were alot of different things to watch on the tvs. Definitely our new spot for Friday night fish fry. Apps were great too! Potato skins were fresh and cooked perfectly. Great place."}
{"text":"Great lunches at PM. The OTB is a great way to kill a few extra minutes that the kitchen often seems to need. I'm a fan of the sandwiches and fish platter. Slow service seems to be the kitchen and not the wait staff. The wait is worth it...sort of. It's not a fast stop for lunch, but the combination of OTB and good food make it a winner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Such a chill place to grab a few drinks and some decent food. There's tons of tvs too which is a plus. Victoria is the best server and always takes such good care of us. She's sweet attentive and on top of things. Ask to sit in her section. The only con is the decor is a little dingy, but homey."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place with excellent food reasonably priced. A ton of TVs and quick service. Wish I'd found it earlier.  Excellent burgers and amazing mac and cheese (add the diced chilis!)"}
{"text":"Good food and great entertainment. I go here nearly every Tuesday night. My son's guitar instructor hosts Tuesday Blues Day at Padre Murphy's. You want an excellent value grab a snack (nachos and wings are good) have a beer or two and listen to live blues music by a masterful guitarist and his students and musician friends (sax players, singers, blue harpists, etc..). To date, and I've been here fairly regularly for several months, I haven't had any bad food or service (though the meet the devil chicken wings weren't as intimidating as they name implied)."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar.  The staff is almost always on point.  Pricing is good.  They need to take reservations for special events like UFC."}
{"text":"Let me go ahead and eat my words a bit. THEY HAD A FACE LIFT!! Just like I had said in my first review, I think they could use a bit of a re-model. Well... They Bar certainly has. And they even spiced up the outside with some greenery as well. I think it most definitely helped. The bar is pretty cool. I've never seen a tap like that. A very large square set up, nice shiny and new. They added a bunch of craft beers. The liquor is now in the cutest rustic looking display in the back. Lit up and behind rusted looking wires. I really like it. The staff has newer, updated, modern attire. I have to give them some credit. They are really starting to look like a more modern Irish Sports Bar. There for I am giving them their 5th star. I hope they keep updating. Even if its little by little."}
{"text":"I wish this place was something better than it is. I have been here at various hours and the drinks are always overpriced compared to other bars within a five-mile radius. Trying to snag a waitress while sitting at a table even if it isn't slammed is one of the most daunting tasks, as clearly they are too busy with whatever it is that they are doing to see you want to stay and spend more of your hard earned money on their business. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Had reservations today at 1pm for 15 people for Mother's Day. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. It started out bad and never recovered. The waitress came over for drinks when we first sat down, and she knew we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. She obviously wasn't paying attention to our table because once everyone arrived we waited for about 15 minutes before we had to go track her down. Then it took another 20 minutes just to get our buffet plates. WHY?????? She was good after that about bringing clean ones, but didnt remove a SINGLE dirty plate. We ended up piling them on the table behind us. Now on to the food. When we arrived about 1/3 of the food was gone. Most of what was left was cold, and sitting in nasty grease. Being pregnant, there's NO WAY I'm eating room temp chicken or beef.  90% of the fruit was gone, the pasta salad and deviled eggs were not being kept cool. When we asked the waitress about it she said they were working on replacing the food. Not until we were almost done did some things get replenished. In hindsight, we should have ordered from the menu but even that took forever for some in our party and the place wasn't even full of patrons. During the entire time we were there, no one got offered drink refills. I had to flag another waitress down to get water for my kids because she forgot. At the end of the meal getting our checks she had the nerve to add 18% gratuity for the large party. Normally I don't mind, in fact I usually tip 20% as a rule. But in NO WAY did she even come close to earning it. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"A MUST VISIT. I was visiting from out of town and my brother and I were on a food/pub crawl. This was my second lunch of the day and I had the hot corn beef samich with fries. A very good samich and the atmosphere was great with the college football games going on and watching people plunk down for the pony and dog races. Lots of TV's and big patio which was covered up so they could run the ac outside. I will be back and my brother said this place takes over the whole parking lot for St. Pats day with bands and other live-ations we Irish do."}
{"text":"A great venue to catch the Sunday games. There are several big screens viewable from every seating option; That gives this off the path place a 5stars Large icy pitchers of cold, cheap brewsky...5stars A weird tasting Monte Cristo Sandwich with a dip of grape jelly (not the norm that Ive had)..2 stars .. on the ick side.  A HUGE Stoli bomber during a touchdown that I spoke smack prior to point.. 5stars... TRULY will get you a quick tipsy.. to handle all the bs in this place and the fact you are out in where is this PHX?  A  waitress who continuously called my un-dateable, douche bag of a Sunday game  date  'babe' and flirted while not real friendly to me.. & had to be flagged down despite her leaning on the bar chatty-cathy behavior..forgetting lemon for the weird tasting tap water.. 2stars ... He gets a 0 star and a L on his forehead that is too large anyway.  Sorry if I ask twice.. your a two.. AND to be a flirty girl @ work? That's desperate , yo! I'm a girl raised with a smudge of class and this place is not. So a 1star for your lack of flirt skills!.. Maybe this girl  should show her how to get it done while not irritating the others girls she's supposed to be serving , yes.: serving .. in the group...  All other things bring this place to the fun mode... :-) And down to it, this place COULD be fun, IF the food was decent; the service was up to par; and maybe with a decent guy. Hmmm.. It's a douchey divey wanna be Sunday game day bar .. It fails at best."}
{"text":"I'm finally getting around to writing a review of this place. I have had several items in the menu and most are pretty good. The only thing that I did not like was the chili. More of a preference thing than anything else. Their preparation has several types of different beans and the meat they use is chunky. Not ground beef, which I prefer.  Some of the sandwiches that are good are the Reuben and the Patty Melt. My favorite dish so far was the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy which also came with a side of steamed vegetables. Other than that, I enjoy this place for watching games and just relaxing. Parking can be a bit dicey sometimes so get there early for your game. Also, they do have a large patio that you must walk through to enter the bar. This Patio however reeks of smoke no matter the number of patrons out there. That is a drawback for me but may not bother others.   The reason for 3 stars?  The place is not always the cleanest, the food is usually good but lacks even one item that I'm dying to come back for, and the waitstaff always looks pretty rough like they just rolled out of bed."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to check out Padre Murphy's.  They were showing the UFC fights on a Sat night.  No cover to see them.  It's in a shopping center and there was plenty of parking.  Harley Davidson was outside doing a give away and people were playing corn hole. We walked in and got a seat at the bar.  They had the fights on along with horse racing and an arena football game.  They have horse betting for people that like that.  The bar seemed really new.  All the taps looked new.  Tons of beer on tap which was very fresh and cold.  Service was fast and the bar staff was very attentive.  The place was clean and so were the bathrooms.   The place has a ton of TV's.  We had the wings which they grilled and had good flavor.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  Tasty burger!  Fries were good too.  All in all, a good sports bar."}
{"text":"Padres is a staple of north Phoenix. We love the trivia nights and the great food. Been many times and love the restaurant. They have horse race betting if you enjoy that too. The st Patrick's day event is always packed."}
{"text":"We love Padre Murphy's My husband and I go there often Great food  Great service  Just love hanging out there.  Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed in Padre Murphy's. We went there on a week night, and despite the place being three quarters empty and only a few other patrons in the whole place, service was very, very slow. It took more than 20 minutes before anyone came to take even drink orders. Another 10 minutes or so before the server came back with drinks, and we'd been seated for over an hour before our food came out (very basic / fried stuff that should've been quick).   Also, this has nothing to do with the food or service really but I have a moral issue with the dog betting they offer, so even if the food and service were great, I wouldn't go back.   However, this review really is about the disappointing food and service. For the price, I've had better bar food. What I will say is that they have a very extensive menu with lots of different options, both food an alcohol. So that's why the 2 stars instead of just one.   Bathrooms were very dirty and didn't look like they'd been serviced in a while. Definitely one of those bathrooms where you put your best levitation skills to work!   Overall, nothing at Padre Murphy's would bring me back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Never had such horrible service in my life. Not the type to complain at the restaurant but I can imagine that not touching your order even though you ordered it would imply that something was wrong. Our waitress never asked nor cared. The service is so horrible I couldn't imagine it being any worst. Ever the beer we ordered came to us at room temperature. Thank you Padre Murphy's for ruining our afternoon."}
{"text":"Busy as always! Fast service, great Pastrami sandwich, will be returning SOON!"}
{"text":"I just moved into town and stopped here for a cold one and to get some a.c. I thought I was walking into a hole in the wall bar. The place was huge inside! I was blown away by all the TVs and the off track betting right off the bat. They had TONS of beer to choose from which was cool for me and my bf!!! The food was awesome! I was very pleased with my \"godfather\" sandwich (hot of course). We loved the homemade Mac n cheese we shared (u can add tons of stuff) And my bf loved his quesadilla (half chicken and half beef). The wait-staff was upbeat! And they had free shuffle board, which gave us something to do!!! overall this place is a 5 in my books,i will deff be coming back again, soon!   P.s phoenix is way to hott!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  I went in to watch the Rose Bowl with some friends and it took me flagging down the server to get a drink. And as I went to ask for a food menu she walked away from me. 30 minutes later when she brought my drink I asked again for a food menu. She promptly brought menus and left. The food was great but again,  the server cared more about closing out the tab with the shift change then asking if we wanted more items. The deal breaker was when we left her tip (a minimal amount) she had the nerve to say we didn't leave one. Did I mention it was NOT busy at all?"}
{"text":"Went in here after the gym to grab some lunch and a few drinks. Great beer selection, Irish nachos were pretty delicious, though our food took quite awhile to arrive. The energy level of the staff was way down. No one was smiling. We weren't greeted with a friendly hello. The bartender had her head down the whole time and the other waitress (not ours) stood at the back of the restaurant with her arms crossed, frowning the entirety of our visit. She was also at the door when we left and didn't say a single word to us. I'm pretty big on customer service so I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Megan, was awesome she was very accommodating and provided great service. She is a valued employee and I appreciate her service!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, tons of Tv's, and a chance to see Dr Jesse Maguire. What else do you need!?"}
{"text":"We have our impromptu business meetings here. On late lunches, we have made it a few times to just the beginning of happy hour - It is definitely a \"local\" place, that locals know about and hang out at. A little dated - but decent.  I usually have the Chicken Jerk Sliders - YUMMY. They have a pretty decent beer selection. Nothing else stands out as over the top good on the menu. Just average.   TV's everywhere - you won't miss a sports game if it is on. Bathrooms are kept very clean - at least during the lunchtime - might be a different story when nighttime drinking starts."}
{"text":"This place has been solid for many years. Good food, good service, tons of TVs for sports fanatics, and off track betting. Recently they added craft brews too! You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Good menu. Service is always a little slow. I think the regulars have just gotten used to it. They have OT betting and that is a big draw.  The beer selection is broad and covers many of Arizona's local brewers. Lots of TV'S to catch a wide array of games.   It's a good crowd filled with many of my fellow Irish patrons... Good vibe. It can get a little loud from time to time. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Best garlic fries and spinach dip around and OTB. Great atmosphere. No good deserts though tried them all no good ones."}
{"text":"Was here a week ago Saturday and again this past Friday and I will tell you this I will never drink a alcoholic beverage from here again. Both times. Same bartender. Ordered a kettle and soda water and both times absolutely no alcohol in them. I don't mind paying nine or ten dollars for a drink but when I don't get any alcohol in my drink I get mad. If you are on a pour count then use the jiggers. Do not rip the customer off just because you don't know how to pour correctly. When the waitress tells you that everyone of her tables has complained about the same thing maybe you should rethink your line of work and stick to waitressing. The sad part is I like the food and the people there but will not ever spend another dime at this place."}
{"text":"Weak cocktails, slow service and overpriced food.  This place is so cheap that they don't have paper towels in the restrooms!  Don't bother washing ur hands here because you have to grab the dirty ass door to exit the bathroom.  What a joke!"}
{"text":"It's not worth dealing with RUDE STAFF and an UNBEARABLE ENVIRONMENT. Their staff needs serious re-training. We used to go here all the time. The food is amazing! However, I have it seems like the experience is getting worse each time we go. We went in on a Tuesday night with a party of 10, looking to have dinner. The place had only about 1/3 of their tables full, almost all of them were their 2 person tables. After waiting about 5 minutes before a host even acknowledged us, we asked for a table. There was a band playing and had the music cranked up so loud that on the opposite side of the restaurant from the band, I had to cup my hands around my mouth and yell at the top of my lungs at a person 8 inches from me and they still couldn't hear me. People in our party who were sitting next to each other at the table couldn't hear each other. When I attempted to speak with the waitress about it, she looked at me and turned around, and walked away. I am astonished at the poor level of service. As for the noise, I am not saying don't have a band, but when the volume is that loud that you can't hear someone sitting right next to you, I question whether you are running a bar/grill or a night club. I think I have had easier times hearing someone in a night club than I did in their restaurant. We do dinner as a group once a week. We tend to average a $200-$300 tab. We got up and walked out and not one staff member stopped to ask us if there was anything they could assist with. It seems like the owners are having more fun reliving their glory days in a bar, then focusing on the service needed to effectively run a restaurant. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how good the food is, if that is the only thing going for them, I will choose to go somewhere else every time."}
{"text":"We went there for st. pattys day and still couldn't get in with a VALID drivers license.  And really? A security man in a wheel chair??? Not very intimidating....Just another @sshole that thinks he can talk to people how ever he wants. I used to be a regular. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Great local spot to catch a game or bet on a few races. Nothing really ever wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The music and beer selection has GREATLY improved! Good job guys! The service is still great and we really enjoy the OTB. It's a fun place to go with a group of friends or a celebration. They have really good wings...order them extra crispy, with \"meet the devil\" sauce and grilled...trust me;) We will keep coming back now!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Padres is a North Phoenix \"icon\" but that does not mean I have to love each time I am there right?   I like most of the food. The drinks are all good. The service is usually good. The live band \"western bred\" was really cool people.   The rest is just ok. There was nothing that was outstanding or terrible. Just a good old bar.   I know the ST Paddys experiance is a good time here."}
{"text":"Going to Padre Murphy's on Fridays for Fish and Chips is a tradition and somewhat a routine for loads of peeps in northwest Phoenix. I had to try it. My first visit was for lunch with a coworker and have been back a couple of times for their Fish & Chips on Fridays.   It's somewhat of a dated sports bar but with lots of cool sports pics on the walls and plenty of great TVs everywhere to watch sports, horse and dog races. Plenty of room, clean and inviting and even has a couple of betting windows for the race tracks. Their service is exceptional and very consistent with each visit. The crowd is somewhat of an older, couples crowd but kid friendly.   Padre Murphy's bottomless Fish and Chips on Friday has a great taste and it is what a lot of peeps keep coming back for. I've tried some of their Irish dishes and found them to be average or below compared to other places. Their sandwiches and burgers are OK and their open faced roast beef plate is one of their best sellers. But I, like most peeps come here for their Fish & Chips on Fridays.   Maybe I will see you there sometime on a Friday eating Fish & Chips ;-)"}
{"text":"We sat outside and our waitress Karen was the best! The food is always perfect. Get something with French Fries!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings were superb and Lauren from Australia was a blast to talk to and very courteous and accomodating. Definitely will go back. BTW, unlimited raspberry iced tea!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible. We have had almost e everything they had and it's all nasty. They had great wings before but recently messed them up as well! They badly need a new menu. Good place for horse race gamblers I guess?"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to hang out or swing by for dinner, but it's pretty pricey in terms of drinks and the food is meh. Sandwiches are always very salty and the meat doesn't seem so fresh. However, if you're here just for beer or UFC night, it is a pretty decent place to relax with friends. Karaoke night is fun too."}
{"text":"I like the place, not so loud you can't think. The food is good every time I have been there. Chili is my favorite along with the wings. Nice place for my executive weekly meetings - OK its really just a great place to have a beer or two. I just had there Carrot Cake and it was really good but next time I'm going to try the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. 2 thumbs up (Oh and Mary has been our server for a few times and she is personable and friendly). Great place!"}
{"text":"Been visiting Padre Murphy's for years! Always dependable for some good Irish food and definitely the fried fish. Love the fact you can eat drink and bet on races at the same time at the same place what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm a fairly big fan of Padre Murphy's. I come every year for St. Patrick's Day and for most sporting events with a very large group of my friends. But tonight made me realize they are skimping on their alcoholic beverages. I ordered 7 Long Island Ice Teas during the fights. Normally that would have anyone  sleeping in a corner near the bar on the ground in any other establishment but tonight I'm just fine wishing I was a little more buzzed. Extremely disappointed that I spent so much money and did not get my money's worth. I will be watching my sporting events in other venues who don't try to save a few dollars by diluting their beverages."}
{"text":"Our local go to. We watch a lot of the games here but it's hit or miss if you are going to get the sound on. Food is a bit spendy for what it is. Service is always good. Family friendly with a big patio."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Took us 45 mins to get a beer on the outside patio, same as our food.  45 minutes for fried pickles and Gumbo!  The checks were messed up at the end as well.  Granted it was a Monday night football, but staff accordingly.  We were celebrating a birthday as well and no offer for free a free drink, shot nothing. Last time I would intentionally go here."}
{"text":"Good beer selection on tap. Grilled wings very good but expensive for a bar. Basket of chicken tenders was only 3 small tenders. Not the place to go if you want to hear the Monday Night Football game. Outside tables too close together and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"First time visit, LAST.  Jambalaya was horrid.  Sausage was old dried up, shrimp ok.  Was not made like a true Jambalaya.  Sons steak was ok but baked potato was old dis-colored not white like fresh.  Husband had meatloaf said \"nothing to write home about.\"  Bread was about the only good tasting part of all three meals. Service was low, had to keep flagging  down waitress.  Waste of money.  We will never never go back"}
{"text":"No fault of the service, which was friendly, expeditious, and attentive, but the three of us dining with the Padre tonight were each a bit disappointed with our separate entree. My housemate who had been there before found the lasagna and shepherd's pie now gone from the menu, and so settled on a rib special, while the other two of us had the flat-iron steak, and pork chops, respectively.  Each of our meals came with buttered bread, and I think at least 2 of the 3 with a small corn on the cob, and one side (fries or baked potato, coleslaw, or cottage cheese, or rice pilaf.    Rib plate roomie found the BBQ ribs of decent size, but tasteless other than the BBQ sauce, which he feared was spicy hot enough that it might not settle well on his very heat-sensitive stomach, and it did not.  Nuff said.  Flat-iron steak roomie was very disappointed in his steak, described on menu as \"an (sic) unbelievable tender and flavorful . . . 10oz steak topped with aged white cheddar, sautéed mushrooms, and Irish whiskey glaze\".  Unfortunately what he found unbelievable was the description, as he found the steak to be other-than tender, as well as dry and flavorless, and the white cheddar not on the steak at all, but on the side, and not  resembling white cheddar least as anticipated.  My pork chop entrée is described as two French-cut, pan-seared, bone-in 5 oz. chops, with a roasted red pepper sauce.  As you might expect from \"5 oz.\" chops, they were of modest size and thickness, but looked appealing and were \"okay\", but perhaps also to be expected from a fairly thin chop, they weren't juicy, were a bit on the dry side and the only detectable flavor was in the stripes blackened from the pan searing, which has to me always tasted just  a bit \"burned\".   The roasted red bell pepper sauce drizzled across the top added a bit of color, but seemed to have no flavor at all.  Some fire-roasted red tomato, even right out of a jar, would have been an improvement.    Ambiance wise, well, it is a sports bar, it was Saturday night, the place was full, and perhaps as many as a couple dozen flat-screens showed everything from horse and greyhound racing to a Suns game and one or more NFL games, and more that I failed to take in.  A number of enthusiastic NFL fans were in attendance, and with the volume turned up on more than one separate event, it was a bit LOUD for normal conversation. And frankly, I just don't get it.  It's not like there was anything on of lasting significance and great importance to the overall balance of the universe, like say, ACC basketball.  On the good side, the meals were not expensive, it was good enough we all cleaned our plates and none of us left hungry.  The most expensive of our meals was the steak at $13.99, with both the BBQ ribs and my chops coming in at (I believe) $9.95 each.   Our server was new, but performed admirably.  We had no long wait for anything, from greeting to seating, to receiving either menus or meals or final check.  Service was reasonably attentive without being intrusive, and our server (Christina, I think) even took the time to inquire about the items roomie was disappointed to find missing from the current menu, and informed him call in some days ahead, he could special order the lasagna and they'd make it just for him.  We extend our compliments to staff and management for the extra efforts to satisfy, and for that I round upwards our 2-star \"have had better\" food, to a slightly weak \"3\" on account of the good service, and comfortable, if tonight a bit loud, atmosphere.  If there's there's something on sports-wise that you're into, I think Padre Murphy's probably a fine, fun place to gather with friends to see it, and might not be disappointed with the appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and beer.    Brevity.  I've really got to work on brevity."}
{"text":"Great Spaghetti and meatballs...the marinara is delicious, not straight from the can like most places. The burgers are awesome go for the Mike Byrnes, it's always a great choice!"}
{"text":"Great fish fry on Friday's and the service is always 5 star! Tory, our waitress, also gets 5 stars for her professionalism! Thanks Padre Murphys!  :-)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Padres forever to bet on the dog races, and have a good time. Today will probably be my last. My wife(8months pregnant) and I were seated by the staff. We ordered our food and everything was fine. A few minutes later, the owner bullied us out of our seats, because he had that table reserved for a bud light rep. Ok fine, we will move if we have to. So he offered to give us a table where my wife had to stand, or the smoking section. Wtf?! No professionalism or courtesy for a pregnant woman for his staff's screw up. He proceeded to try and fix it by offering to buy her a drink...classy."}
{"text":"Irish bar no cider - 1 star.   Irish names on food but mostly it's Irish-American rather than anything approaching  auld country.  K I am not a sports bar type of guy which isn't as oxymoron despite claims to the contrary but over the last couple of years I've started following hockey which is why I ended up here early on a Sunday morning.   Foodwise: The wings have a jokey name \"meet the devil\" when I doubt they could summon up Tinkerbelle on a bad hair day.  Salty too.  They are \"grilled\" but it seems like breaded  fried and then grilled. The presentation is fine, the price not excessive but it's not what it says your getting by a long shot.  I followed up with a poorly named shepherd's pie which was ground beef, over-seasoned and salty.   It's not in the same league as what's being put out at Tim Finnegans.    Service on what was a busy/ noisy day was consistently good and the number of screens made it easy to find a great spot to watch the game.  Certainly going back here for future games but I can't see me ever needing to pop in for the food."}
{"text":"Considering this is a sports betting bar overall, I loved this place.  First of all, on Tuesdays they have a trumpet player with a Ph.D. and 2 Grammys that plays from 5:30-8:30 pm that is so worth seeing/hearing.  I never in a million years thought I would be able to really enjoy hours of trumpet playing but I did--and, yes, he IS that good!  Loved it!  Strongly urge anyone interested in music to go hear this fella.  He also sings with a pretty mellow voice which was just as entertaining to listen to.  By the way, this is all FREE and no cover charge to come in!  Good deal for sure!  As for the food, depends on what you get.  I got the sliders which I was meh about.  My son got the steak sandwich and fries which he loved--and I have to admit that I wanted to steal some of his fries, cause they were cooked perfectly crisp (but I didn't steal any).  Looked yummy.   Had a prickly pear margarita which was fine other than not sure what type of tequila they use as I got a headache from either the dry Phoenix air or the booze.  Regardless, I am no drinker at all, so someone else might just love it. Service was good, gal was nice and even found out some information about the entertainer for me and no complaints there. We went with a group, and all of us said we liked the place.  I know I will be back on Tuesday sometime in the future just to hear the entertainer if nothing else.  To me, this is a good, fun place to be on a weeknight and worth the trip for sure."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!! After taking nearly an hour to even find parking on St Pattys Day, I was charged $15 just to get INTO THE ENCLOSURE!! After standing in line for nearly an hour to try to get a drink, I STILL HADNT SUCCEEDED! What a freakin RIP-OFF! I have eaten and drank at this place for many years, BUT NEVER AGAIN!!! They may have made a PILE OF MONEY, in a short time tonight-but unfortunately they will see long lasting effects of their Greed!!! Saw many others leaving disgustedly also!! Poor greedy Bustards!"}
{"text":"An insider tip.  Go to Padres on a Tuesday when local jazz legend Jesse Maguire is playing.  The caliber of his musicianship is unparalleled, and a rare find outside of NYC, Chicago, or the like.    The service is good.  The beer selection -  excellent.   And the food menu, ambitious but well executed, for a neighborhood sports bar."}
{"text":"Total bill was ~$98. We had 4 adults with 2 kids, so we ordered things without looking at the menu. When the mozzarella sticks were delivered, we were surprised that there were only 4. My wife said it could have been from the kids menu. When we received the bill, we saw the $6.99 price tag, I asked to see the menu. There was no indication they were only going to give 4. We asked to speak to the manager. He said \"those are our prices so we're not going to back off of that\". We didn't even ask for money. We were bringing to his attention how that's quite a messed up practice that everybody everywhere sells 6 mozzarella sticks for around that price for as long as I or anyone has ever known. Just for everyone's understanding, this entire conversation was less than 15 seconds. So there was no arguing or discussion. I will never go here again, (my wife worked here a long time ago so we frequent this place a lot, as well as my family who moved into town a couple years ago) and I will continue to word of mouth what happened to me here, as well as what I THINK they are trying to do - manipulate the public into paying more for less. Risky business practice if you ask me."}
{"text":"A can't miss sports bar/grill to watch any sporting event!  If you are a fish & chips fan stop by on a Friday night for their all you can eat special.  Always a good time at Padre's!"}
{"text":"We're long time patrons but something has changed. The last 3 times there the meals were very disappointing.  Perhaps a change in kitchen staff? We had burgers last night and we ordered med. rare and they were dry and over cooked. Prior to that we had prime rib that was fatty and chewyand the chicken fried stake was over cooked. Service has gotten hit or miss depending on your serve. Seems to be a large turn over in wait staff."}
{"text":"After a 14 hour day, I was really looking forward to an ice cold pitcher of beer.  So, I met a friend at Padre's.  I got a menu and let them know we were sitting outside.    We waited 30 minutes...nothing.    I went inside to order at the bar... 3 waitresses avoided eye contact....nothing.    I went back outside and waited for another 5 minutes... the waitress went to other tables, but ours?  Nothing...  If I wanted to be ignored while wanting alcohol, I would have gone to a family function.   So, Padre's... thanks for (you guessed it) NOTHING!"}
{"text":"We show up to watch the Cardinals game for breakfast with the kids and this joke of a place had only two TVs in the dining area showing the Cardinals game. And this is an Arizona sports bar? Really? Meanwhile all the waitresses have Cardinals jerseys on and their digital sign says Go Cards on it. So pretty much don't go here if you want to catch a local team game, but Raiders and Steelers, yep they've got that."}
{"text":"The service we had was excellent, couldn't have asked for a nicer server and knowledgeable on everything we asked her. The boys had fun placing bets while our daughter helped dad with his. Fun place and will definitely be back many times this football season."}
{"text":"I checked this place out recently because I found out that I could get dividend airline miles through my US Airways program that I am in.  I wouldn't normally go to a sports bar during the day, but I thought what the heck?  I was the guy drinking a coke at the bar, unlike most of the other patrons.  I tried the special, which was a bratwurst sandwich  with sauerkraut and tater tots.  Not bad, but nothing to say oh wow over. Maybe I am over critical on restaurants that seem outdated, but this sports bar was a blast from the past.  I believe that something that worked in the past doesn't necessarily work in the present.  Maybe I was just way too young to be in the establishment(32 yrs old), but come on, change with the times!"}
{"text":"What a dump. Sitting on the patio with a large group. We came late and 20 minutes no waitress. Couldn't get the order straight, just garbage service and mediocre bar food coupled with Luke warm beer. Manager finally got involved and it kinda got sorted out. Now I remember why I don't come here but it was a ping away party. Never again"}
{"text":"Enjoyable night.  Single lady looking for dinner and a glass of wine in a friendly place.  Found a spot at the bar.  Good service.  Average food - sorry.  Great TV locations for watching game."}
{"text":"only been here with buddies but overall pretty cool place but way far for me to return so i only go when i know all my folks and friends are going but i would suggest this to other people to return very inexpensive"}
{"text":"They put on a great Super Bowl party. I especially liked the outdoor seating. Service was excellent. The food was just ok. The prizes they gave out were nice and the atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"This is an above average sports bar that should be on the agenda of anyone who lives in surrounding neighborhoods.   The seating is expansive! Plenty of seats at the bar for when you're out with a few bros, and the patio was able to accommodate a large outing of a couple dozen people.   The beer selection is surprisingly great. They've got dozens of taps, and a few of them, such my Elysian Space Dust IPA, are examples of good lesser-known brews you don't run into every day.   I really only tried some apps like mozzarella sticks or quesadillas, and they were OK. The menu is huge, so you'll find something that doesn't disappoint.   I'd come out here to watch sports, get my beer snobbery on, or even play Cards Against Humanity. Nice job on giving me something fun to do in the north valley."}
{"text":"Tom has built a great establishment with great food and great people!  His new bar and tap system is amazing! Food is great with awesome service."}
{"text":"Good West side sports bar with a mellow and relaxed vibe. The house is comfortable with lots of TVs. The gals that took care of us were very cool, it's definitely not a scene. There are quite a few different beers. A decent place to meet a friend if your in North West Phoenix."}
{"text":"Don't come here to eat food if the ufc fight is playing. For some odd reason, it's illegal now to have a minor in a restaurant while a total legal fight is playing.  Never had an issue with boxing. Padre Murphys won't be getting a return from us.   Two adults and our child and all heck might break loose and endanger him while he sits and eats food in the dining area.  God forbid we subject him to betting on horses and dogs during the week. That's totally acceptable to management though.  I guess Tailgaters down the road doesn't have the same policy."}
{"text":"Cool place, but do NOT get the chicken. Mine was like rubber, I had to send it back and just didn't eat. So gross. Dirty place. But seems fun if you get drunk"}
{"text":"We had a super fun time at Padre Murphys this afternoon and Taylor was our server. Taylor was super personable, provided excellent service and our food was great!!!! Thanks a bunch Taylor. We will ask to sit in the section she is serving next time too."}
{"text":"This is a pretty lively bar with a legit sandwich menu and an overall sports-centered theme.  I would describe it as the bar version of an Irish guy who moves to Phoenix and becomes indoctrinated with the boot-wearing country culture, yet retains a few Irish traditions.  There is a big outside patio that seems to be popular on balmy Phoenix nights, and spacious booth seating on the inside as well.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and a Bass draught.  The bread was a crusty roll, with a nice golden buttery toasting on the inside edges.  The steak was thin and extremely tender, with very small soft diced peppers and onions mixed throughout.  On top, a blanket of gooey white cheese (provolone?) smothered the tender meat in an explosion of decadence.  It was served alongside pretty typical bar-style French fries (medium thickness, fried crisp, golden color) but there was way too much seasoned salt on the fries.  Of course, bar games and body shots were in full effect up at the bar and allegedly this is a gambling hot spot during the races.  Overall a pretty solid spot for cold beer and hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have to agree that the happy hour here is lame. Their prices are too high, and their beer/liquor selection WAY too low. The servers are hot, the food is decent, the TV's are everywhere. If there were not other places within a few miles that have better deals, better beer selection and better food, this place would get more stars. However, it can be PACKED, so they must be doing something right..."}
{"text":"We use to frequent this place a long time ago. Still nice and they have horse and dog races on tv and you can bet. Their food is always good except for today. The spaghetti was just warm and meatballs were cold. Waitress was friendly and nice"}
{"text":"Living on the west side, you get the best sports bar.....with live betting (dogs and horses).  The food is good.  Service is.....slow.....really really slow."}
{"text":"Valerie was great, very tentative and knew all about everything. She came back very quickly to answer all questions and the food was A+ today. Past couple experiences have been subpar, but taday was amaze! One of our fave naieborhood joints has made a come back."}
{"text":"Very good sports bar. The bartenders are awesome, friendly, and they make everyone feel comfortable especially Kelly-Ann. Generous servings with good prices. The owner is very personable and makes everyone feel welcomed. St.Patricks Day is a must. The entire parking lot is tented off and there is entertainment all day long. Padre Murphy's is a great place for a game, pay per view fights, off track betting and live entertainment. Without a doubt one if not the best sports bar in North Phoenix. What I like most is Padre Murphy's is not a boring corporate business, but a locally own establishment, which to me makes the place stand out from all the others. I really liked the fish and chips(all you can eat) on Fridays, and the corned beef sandwich. If your looking for a game on tv, Padre Murphy's is the place to be."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a coworkers going away shindig.  The place was cool.  We had a large table outside on the patio and our waitress was on top of everything.  Blue Moons were $4.00 during Happy Hour and they had food deals too.  The people next to me got fish and chips and coconut fried shrimp (you order them individually...$1.29 each...they were big) and seemed to enjoy them.  This place has a grip of TVs but most of them are live link horse racing tracks.  Padres is an off site betting place with kiosks where you can wager on horse racing.  Interesting mix of folks...old timers with their racing programs to younger 20 somethings hanging out.  It was a chill spot and I could see myself coming back for a beer after work with the gang."}
{"text":"Went for the St Patty's Day tent-stravaganza (or at least that's what I'm calling it- see pics) and it was fun people watching but WAY overpriced for food or drink. OK, I get that you have costs for all the additional staff, equipment, bands, etc. but to charge $6-$8 for a beer when you are charging a $10 cover as well is ridiculous IMO. I went this year to see what its like but I won't go again next year. If you want to blow a Franklin (easily) go here next year on St. Patty's, but don't expect to have any money left 2 hours later."}
{"text":"We meet friends here about once a month and the prime rib sliders are my fav...their shoe string fries are addicting. My drinks however are inconsistant. When we get the young waitresses on the patio they are pros! But the last 2 times we've gone we've gotten this older lady who is a real sweetheart but not on the ball at all!"}
{"text":"I like this place. First off its a huge building, so finding a seat shouldn't be a problem. They have tons of sports decor on the wall- lots of old black and white photos; a lot of Yankee stuff. The TVs in here are huge and there are a lot of them. The food is decent and I think they serve it until pretty late. We ate around 10pm last time. They have cool music trivia on Friday nights where you can win gift certificates here. The people who host the music trivia are very friendly. The servers we've had have also been very friendly and checked back on us frequently. The outside of this place doesn't look like much but I think it's really nice on the inside. Give it a chance. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Padre's if your looking for a local sports bar. But it's not really worth the drive if you have other places closer to you.  The place has tons of room, more tv's then it knows what to do with, and the waitstaff is generally pretty kick ass. Friday nights tend to be crazy insane as apparently everyone in the valley shows up for their Fish'n chips.  Otherwise the drinks are okay, a pint of Hefe will run you about 4.25 and shots a little more so. The bar food is adequate and the crowd is.. well the Scottsdale crowd it is not.   As others have mentioned, they do have off-track betting, which can make the place more interesting depending on who is there and if they are winning or not  ;)"}
{"text":"Surprised only a 3 star overall.  Food is really good.  I've had the pretzel ribeye, and a burger and all were excellent and prices reasonable, great spot to watch sports, usually good service, except for 1 waitress..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Couldn't get a drink unless we walked up to the bar ourselves. Been standing at the bar for 10 min to get tab."}
{"text":"The fish was too thin and batter was cooked past crunchy, took alot longer than normal to get...  should have just asked for my money back.   As for the place being clean, they must have read the bad reviews on here,  it was in good order... I did notice that most of the staff were basically wondering around doing nothing.   All the TVs meant nothing to me as I don't care for sports of ORBit,  why did I come to this place..."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great beer prices. Great service and Friday nights are fun with the music trivia."}
{"text":"Mr pib is flat, Friday fish fry is great."}
{"text":"So, the food isn't really all that Irish (should have expected that, though, with a name like \"Padre Murphy's\"), BUT the beer is cold (and lots of different types too!), service was friendly, and the food was edible.  I likely won't be back, but I didn't walk away feeling like I wasted my time or money, either.  A-OK place to stop by if you're in the area and want a drink."}
{"text":"I went to Padre Murphys for new years eve. We sat a the bar thinking we may get better service. This was as far from the truth as could be. The three girls behind the bar were unpleasant and had no idea how to work together. The brunette girl had a sour attitude and threw our drinks to us across the bar with no napkin or coaster - making a wet mess. The tall blonde looked lost. Maybe it was her first night but she stumbled quite a bit. The short blonde was a fireball and was doing a good job from what I could see. After ordering food and listening to the band for a few, we needed new drinks. I went empty for about 15 minutes. The brunette even served the people beside us and ignored the fact that our glasses were on the rail.  This would be a great place to open a bar. They seemed to have all the liquor and beer but we're not good at serving it. I have never NEVER left a zero tip anywhere I have ever gone. The place was not full at all. The staff was lost. It even looked like the manager or owner came in around 10:30 or so with party favors. Lack of planning runs amuck in this establishment. As a former owner manager, I can safely say the staff and management need severe reevaluation. I am not a supercritical person. I like to think I give people a fair shake. I wouldn't send anyone to this place for any reason unless they wanted to be ignored and die of thirst. If the owners like the way it is running, they will be out of business in no time. Good luck to you if you venture in."}
{"text":"I went with my two kids for lunch.  Pretty good kids menu. .. reasonably priced. Had chicken tenders,  bread sticks & mozzarella sticks.  Kids portions not oversized.  Server was friendly and attentive. I'll come back without the kids and have some beers..... do another review."}
{"text":"The old neighborhood standby is still doing it right. Pub grub with a twist, great beer selection, attentive service...even O.T.B. for the degenerates! The best pub option in the Bellair-rea (groan)."}
{"text":"Food is good, fun atmosphere and attentive service.  I left a not so good review awhile ago about the service.   The service has greatly improved!  Just wanted to add this update."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I call my own personal CHEERS... you know, that neighborhood watering hole? I like many things about this place. They do trivia nights- always fun, especially when you're not planning on trivia yet everyone around you is playing, so the next thing you know, you're playing trivia. The outside patio where smokers can smoke without judgment. Inside, booths and tables a plenty. They also have lots of tv's and it's crazy how many folks watch dog races. Betting too, if that's your thing. Fridays, they have a fish fry which seems to be popular because it's always hella crowded on Fridays.  But mainly, the food here is REALLY good! I recommend eating here. Why? Because they serve damn GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Located adjacent to O'Reilly Auto Parts- Padre Murphy's offers a Sports Bar Oasis to those who find it.  We were there for the 'St. Pierre vs. Shields' fight. We were not charged a cover and were able to find a booth for our party of 6.  FYI, after the 'Live'  coverage, they do offer replays of the match AND offer $1 Sliders to go with. I had ordered the prime rib sliders and paid $9... I could have waited.  Drinks were pretty standard. They did have mojitos, which many sports bars don't seem to offer. TONS OF TVs. My BF thought the on-tap selection was pretty average but did like the mini pitchers they offered for any draft beer.  A disappointment was a server. I think she was 12 years old and had no idea what beers were on tap. Even when my BF ordered Red Rover because he saw the tap head, she said that they did not carry that beer... we had to convince her to just put the order in and see what happened. Low and behold, a mini pitcher of Red Rover came out 15 minutes later!  Food is pretty standard- no gross disappointments. My slider wasn't that great but they do have a Huge variety of sandwiches.  Only true negative is the parking. Many of the parking spots are reserved for the surrounding businesses. There were a few announcements being made throughout the game about people's cars getting towed by O'Reilly's."}
