{"text":"Trader Jack's is tucked away behind a bridge that is going of the Chagrin River and some docks. It might be weird turning into the place going west but once you are there it is great.   The atmosphere is a bar mixed with a BBQ place. There is a bunch of fun things to look at on the walls and a digital jukebox to pick music you want to hear. The times I have gone, the wait was no terribly long maybe 15-20 mins at most. The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic.  The food is just wonderful. They have a good mix of burgers, steaks, and seafood and all of it is simply amazing. If you venture here, you need, NEED, to order the fired mozzarella cheese appetizer, it is one of the best things I have ever tasted.  Overall, this place is amazing , good atmosphere, great food, and the beer selection is not bad. I highly encourage to try it out."}
{"text":"I have tried over and over to get back into this place. The food used to be excellent. Now, not so much. Today I was there for lunch and asked for the Cod fish sandwich which I had a couple of times in recent visits and asked if it was the crisp fluffy cod I have had.  The waitress assured me it was.  Well, it was not. It as a small flat piece of fish that was so overfried that they hid it under a ton of bun and other things.  I had to hunt for this minnow of fish. Last time for me."}
{"text":"This place is completely overrated.  The food is mediocre at best and that's if you get something that doesn't taste freezer-burned.  Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I know, I've been noticeably absent on yelp, so prepare for a lot all at once. That being said, this is long over due. Simply stated the food here is fantastic. I am a pickle connoisseur and the fried pickles here, are the best I've had. The dipping sauce even tastes like it has pickles in it! What could possibly be better than some pickle on pickle action?!  My other fave is the steak salad, not sure of the official name, but the steak is always cooked to perfection, and no matter what dressing you go with, you really can't go wrong. Great quality, well prepared, and service has always been on point as well."}
{"text":"Maybe the next visit will make this five stars. The food was good enough but was hoping for more options and a better cook. I'm sure this is a great place to have some beers and dinner (in that order) with a group of people or if you want to sit outside and see the water.   I'll need to visit again soon because I want to like it."}
{"text":"I eat here often because it overlooks the water. The food occasionally is excellent (like the salads and burgers) otherwise it is pretty run of the mill bar/grill food. I have always had good service and think the prices are reasonable for such a relaxing and comfortable space."}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff is wonderful, it is reasonably priced and their patio is just beautiful. It is my favorite place to go when the weather is nice because the patio is just that wonderful!"}
{"text":"Visited for the 1st time. Slight wait, not too long, they were a little busy. Very friendly staff. Good selection of food, variety. The food was real good, the service was better! Our waitress was attentive but not overly so.  Definitely recommend. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"The calamari is horrible. Please take it off the menu!!  All of the food is mediocre. They have a nice big outdoor patio & bar in back along the river with tv's,ceiling fans, a firepit & outdoor heaters during colder months Sept & Oct. Nice place to have a drink & watch a game. Not a great choice if your looking for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Been going here weekly for years food is bit pricey but good. Over all it's a great local stop some of the staff rock ."}
{"text":"There are restaurants that have bars and bars that serve food. Trader Jack's walks that narrow line between the two. The location is on the bank of the Chagrin River with plenty of covered outdoor seating which should be great during summer months. Inside is a bit worn and somewhat loud even with a moderate crowd. The portions and taste of our food was good and reasonably priced. Our server was attentive but not very friendly. If I were a local, Trader Jack's would probably be a regular stop for summer cocktails or a late night bite but not so much a dinner destination."}
{"text":"It's a jeans and t shirt joint. Skimpy potions for price . I got salad that I felt should have been larger . Imagine if I had asked for half portion as if the large portion was large or something . It was no bigger than a D Q salad with some grapes nuts and a tablespoon of blue cheese sprinkled on the salad . For the price I really didn't see that if I had wanted chicken on the salad I would have had to pay 4.00 more! Bringing the total to 15.00 for a SALAD!!!! Really?!?!? The salad is called the JEFFERSON. Mr. Jefferson would have called it the bend over. After I walked away hungry and my pocket book was lighter I decided I will never suggest this place to my friends. That memory is not good . Then I was asked by my child to get wings. I ordered them. 10.00 for 12. I expected a decent portion. Lol I will post a picture of that one. As I didn't see them till I got home."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews because I have a tendency to go to the same places over and over. My wife and I have been saying we should go to trader jacks for a while now so on a sunny warm day we decided to enjoy the outdoor deck along the Chagrin River and have a couple cold beers and seafood. I had the yellow perch and my wife had a perch and shrimp combo. The perch was excellent, in my case it was more that I could eat. It came with a side of sweet potato fries and coleslaw which were equally as good. My wife didn't mention anything about the shrimp but ate it all. We also had deep-fried pickles as an appetizer. The batter was excellent and there was enough for four people. The atmosphere was fantastic and our service was stellar. I had a tasty IPA and my wife had a Corona and both were refilled in a timely manner. I would definitely go back to trader jacks and probably will soon. There was also a nice area to sit around a fire pit."}
{"text":"Nice place on the Chagrin River in Eastlake. We try to go when the weather is good so that we can sit outside near the water. All of the food is decent, but the hot pepper pizza is outstanding."}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up getting salad for dinner here and to our surprise both salads were huge and very tasty! One of the best salads that I have had at a restaurant.  I was not expecting this from a burger place. :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local hangouts. Located on the banks of the Chagrin River this restaurant offer good food.The staff is friendly and fun. They have a large menu that will satisfy a wide variety of tastes. They always have interesting specials going on, including some yummy drinks & desserts! Excellent outside seating and bar w/ an updated patio which is heated so it's great for the spring & fall too."}
{"text":"I love local spots like this! They have an adorable location right next to the marina win a side patio that faces the river and docks.  I had their lobster bisque (Amazing!!! You must get it if they have it) and the fried perch.  I'm not a huge fan of perch so that's not their fault (the tiny bones are not my bag...) but it was really good otherwise.  It's probably a 4 star place in actuality but I gave them extra for the bisque and their location.  Plus...gotta support small business!!! It's so close to my house!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at least one meal a week at this restaurant for the last several years. The food is consistently good and the service is good also. The specials they have are a welcome change of pace as I have tried just about everything on the menu. We love this place and it is one of the most popular restaurants in Eastlake."}
{"text":"Went here for fish fry night and the best part was that fish was very fresh. The batter was just ok.   Not sure what it is (maybe it's the foodie or the dietitian in me) but it turns me off that the whole menu is full of heart clogging items. Some people don't always want only deep-fried options.   Overall, It was an ok experience. Not sure if I'll go back again unless I'm looking for a burger or something?"}
{"text":"What a great summer atmosphere! We went I a Wednesday evening, seated right away, the food was quickly served and thoroughly enjoyed! Service was fast when our drinks were empty too. I can't wait to have more summer nights eating/drinking here, especially with that fire pit! Also it's on a canal... really great place.   The bathrooms were filthy tho. Thankfully I didn't see them till on the way out."}
{"text":"Great location and great service.  Just wish there were more tables along the river patio.  Bar stools are nice but tables ate better for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food in Eastlake?  Surprisingly, yes.  (and I'm allowed to 'dis Eastlake since I grew up there)  I had the opportunity to dine at Trader Jack's and watch the sun set over the river last night on their expansive patio.  All while sipping a $5 martini and eating some fried pickles.    The menu is pretty extensive with everything from burgers, to pizza, to salads, to seafood entrees.  It's not the most vegetarian friendly place, but I did enjoy the large salad and baked potato side.  Service was friendly and efficient and the view of boats going down the river is kind of neat.  It's definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"great place to eat. very good service and affordable prices. excellent steak dinner I had with a great sundae for desert."}
{"text":"Frank's hot pepper pizza is one of the best menu items at any restaurant in the area. I never order anything else and why should I. Excellent sauce with a great crust and the sausage stuffed hot pepper on each slice is amazing. I will also recommend trying the lobster bisque if it is available.   Definitely try this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this joint! It's our go to, riverside favorite! Nice to get a table on the patio in the summer, have a tall frosty beer, and watch the river flow. Very relaxing after a crazy work day. One of my favorites is the lake perch dinner. I get sweet potato fries and grilled asparagus to go along with it. Also, the burger's are huge! and cheap, too! $9.99 for a 1/2 pound mushroom & Swiss with fries. I never leave hungry. Also, the martini of the month (Banana Foster this month) is so yummy. Thanks Trader Jack's, for lots of good times!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad! I was so excited to try this place! I've lived nearby all my life and heard a lot of good things and it just wasn't what I expected.  It's a cute place and a really nice location. When you read the menu, your mouth instantly starts watering.        We decided to just get some boneless wings to start. They arrived nicely sauced and when I bit into one, it was cold. We sent them back and when she brought them out they were warm. Nothing special about the spicy garlic sauce. Not that spicy or garlicky.         Then our pizza came out. Provolone, mozzarella, garlic oil, sauce and stuffed Hungarian hot peppers all on this pizza. My boyfriend and I love stuffed peppers and pizza so we thought it would be a win. It was only ok. The peppers and sausage were nice and spicy but I feel there was a little bit too much oil and not enough sauce. And also not enough stuffed peppers!       We wanted to come back and try their sandwiches because they sounded so good, but now were skeptical. Not sure if its worth the money. They could totally make this place work, just need some more love and work on the food."}
{"text":"I have passed this place hundreds of times and never went. I was in a bridal party & this was the rehearsal dinner choice. She had a fixed menu with a ton of variety.  I opted for a buffalo chicken wrap - really good for what it was. Drinks were poured strong and the view was a nice change for the area.  I would definitely come back for a relaxed dinner with the fam or Sunday funday."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated places around. Enjoyed it so much that I recently just booked Trader Jacks for my rehearsal dinner.   Fantastic views and great food proportions as well!"}
{"text":"went there last night with a party of 9. We waited an hour to eat because they said they were so busy yet there were empty 4 tops all over the restaurant the whole time we waited. Understaffed maybe? But usually when im told an hour wait all the tables are full. The outside bar was packed so i was using the inside bar. The bartender that actually served me was very pleasant and did a great job. The other inside bartender was walking around with a scowl on her face completely ignoring us while bitching at the bartender who was actually serving us.  We ordered a bunch of apps while waiting and as they were bringing them out our table was ready, so they brought the apps to the table. They were excellent. We all ordered promptly as we had an hour to review the menu, must of us got the prime rib which by the way was fantastic. Our waitress was completely miserable and rude to the point of being offensive, she actually walked away from me several times as i was speaking to her, no kidding turned around and walked away from me in mid sentence. Not one time during the whole meal did she smile one time. If you want good food at a decent price go eat her. If you want to be ignored and treated like dirt go somewhere else. I realize they were very busy but theres no excuse for someone in the service industry to scowl and ignore you when your trying to spend money in there establishment. By the way the food was so good i tipped around 35 percent."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Real Lake Erie perch, not fish blocks.  I only ask that since I never call a server \"sweetie\" they do me the same favor.  Great patio."}
{"text":"We go here often. This our \"Cheers \" hangout The pizza, well done, is crispy how I like it. Just had the signature wings for first time. Will be my new favorite.!Alyssa mixes a mean Martini. She always remembers my favorite. They have the best blackened chicken salads . Great burgers. Hang out on the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Great casual place for lunch or dinner. Had the southwestern chicken sandwich it was great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my Wife and I have been here over 12 times in the last year. With that said let me tell you the last time we went.  I do mean the last time too.  :(  My wife ordered their Perch and a glass of wine. I ordered the soup of the day Lobster Bisque for the appetizer and had the dinner special (Strip steak). I know why would you order a steak at a place known for Fish.  Common it was the special of the night so I figured I would get it.    Now let's list the missteps or issues. 1.  My appetizer showed up after I asked about it. Oh yea it was served to me after my dinner was served to me.  Waitress forgot. No longer an appetizer had to choose what to eat hot my dinner or the appetizer.   2. I ordered my strip steak med-well which means slight pink center.  It was undercooked by a mile. Told waitress's that it was undercooked,  she said they would fire another for me.   3. My same steak showed up.  I know this to be mine as it was in the same three prices I gave it back to them. They didn't re-fire another steak ok snob fracture aside,  they put the steak in the microwave until it was a bad, with no flavor very well done cut of meat. I could not eat it had them take it off my bill. Trust me I can eat a bad steak but not this one. :( Good thing I had that cup of Bisque... 4. The waitress seemed to blame it on the cook (no kidding).   Good news My wife had a nice Perch dinner.  ***My first one star on yep. :("}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tend to be simple people.  Every now and then we ask for something to not come with our meal- but never is it complicated or picky. Unfortunately- he always has his order screwed up. BUT NOT HERE! NOPE! Trader Jacks' Sharon, took our order and gave us what we asked for!  What a blessing!  A mistake -free meal! Not only was it mistake -free, but it was delicious,  satisfing, served with a smile and we had an overall - perfect experience!  Thank you Trader Jack- a perfect dinner experience for my birthday guy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Contender for best burgers in the area. Ribs, seafood also good. This place has turned over a couple of times in recent years. It used to be more of a bar-with-food, with every appetizer they could buy from a food service. Seems to have improved its offerings under new owners. Service friendly, but it can get crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"Went here for lobster fest I got the lobster bisque it was so good big chuncks of lobster in it got the lobster pasta with garlic bread it was so good also with big chunks of lobster it was so plentiful I couldnt eat it all my wife got the johnny manzel burger and referenced it to being as big as our one year olds head really good food check it out before lobster fest is over. Came back for lunch while working and ordered the Prime rib sub and my friend got the Texas burger there was so much food and we where so stuffed we couldn't Finnish it all. I love this place they have been consistently good everytime we go. The staff are super friendly if the weather good there is also outside seating in the marina. And it seems like the lobster bisq is on the menu all the time so awesome."}
