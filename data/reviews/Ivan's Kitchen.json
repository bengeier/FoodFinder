{"text":"We went for Dim Sum on Saturday November 23, 2013.

IVAN's is now CLOSED and it has a different name and wasn't even open before lunch time, so be warned."}
{"text":"Went here looking for dim sum after reading some reviews for \"Number 2 Restaurant\" and found that the sign now says Ivan's. However, they still have the all day dim sum banner out front, so we went in. One table up front was leaving as we were coming in - otherwise the place was empty for Saturday lunch. 

There is a full menu on the table, and the waiter brought us the paper dim sum menu. We ordered the har gow (shrimp dumplings), vegetable+shitake dumplings, cha siu bao (steamed bbq pork buns), zong zi (wrapped rice), luo bo gao (turnip cakes) [they had trad'l with pork and shrimp, and a vegetarian one with mushrooms], one of the steamed rice rolls and one other dish. We ordered too much for just two of us and had trouble finishing it all. The luobogao was good (not greasy like it can be at other places), as were the har gow and buns. My partner liked the spinach in the vegetable dumplings, but I was disappointed to not be able to taste the mushrooms in it. 

Overall, the food was OK-to-good. Price (before tip) came to $22 for the 7 dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Just-Eat.ca this weekend, with mixed results.

Order was based of Vegetarian Spring Rolls ($1.25 each), Chicken Sticks (3 for $3.95),  and Chicken Wings (4 for $3.28 off the Dim Sum menu). Mains included General Tao Chicken ($9.50) and Curry Fried Rice Noodle with Shrimp and Pork ($7.95), and Chicken with Vegetable on Rice ($6.50).

Spring Rolls and Chicken Wings were both generic but decent.
The General Tao Chicken was some of the best I've had in Toronto yet. Perfectly cooked, lightly breaded chicken with diced brocolli, absolutely swimming in sauce leaving enough to pour over rice and such. Fantastic stuff.
The Curry Fried Rice Noodle was okay, but a little dry, especially on the re-heat.
The one weird thing is that no where on the Just-Eat website menu was there the ability to order a side of steamed rice. So just to make sure we had a good amount of rice for the General Tao Chicken we ordered the Chicken w/ Veg on Rice which was okay, nothing special but I had low expectations as I wanted it more for the rice than anything.
But lets talk about the Chicken Sticks. They were skewers of chicken which looked pretty good at first, but within the first bite noticed they were a bit pink inside. As I actually cut the remaining pieces off the stick we realized that the rest of that chicken was bordering on uncooked rawness.  We threw them out after that, but would be afraid of what could've happened if we ate them.

So overall, if this was just based on the General Tao and a Spring Roll, I might have been giving a 5 star review. But with the inconvenience of the rice situation, the mediocrity of the other items, and the most importantly the uncooked Chicken Stick, I'm giving this place a 3 star review, and just barely. 
On the redeeming side, they did have delivery on Christmas Day."}
