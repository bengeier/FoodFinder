{"text":"Delicious! The cheese on the pizza was heavenly. I offered a $5 tip and the delivery guy said it was too much, very nice people."}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy and had a very thick crust (this was not a deep dish or Sicilian). Prices were higher then those shown on the online menu.  When  shown the difference the delivery person  without hesitation pointed to the menu he brought showing the disclaimer that  prices can change without notice. This probably happens often.  Don't be a sucker and order from this masquerade of a pizza shop!"}
{"text":"Just order the souvlaki pitas, u wont be disappointed. Everything else is just ok but the souvlaki pitas are best in town."}
{"text":"Unreliable and sometimes aggressive delivery service. Food is usually ok, but the mafia vibes some of the delivery people give are unpleasant. Even more so because those same vibes are carried on by the managers and employees at the restaurant itself. Very difficult to deal with in general. It may seem surprising that I am talking about this stuff as though I've ordered it many times with such negative experiences. Well, they are open some of the longest hours out of anywhere in town, so my excuse is supply (and demand). Anyway, there is identical food at Altos, but much much better service. Would recommend Altos any day, any week--only between the hours of 4 and 6am would I suggest Angela."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente !  Ouvert très tard - 6@m  Livraison rapide et gratuite !  Plusieurs choix - pizza spécial Angela EXCELLENTE ainsi que leurs soupe du jour ( chicken noodles ma préféré )  Bref 4.5 / 5"}
{"text":"Hungry? Is it 3:53am? Call Angela's and be prepared for an overdose of pizza goodness.   If you order extra cheese, make sure you prepare yourself mentally beforehand.  You don't have many options at this time, and ordering from Angela's is definitely something you won't regret.  Slightly on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"I go to Angela's a lot. Generally speaking, tasty food and fair prices.  The quarter chicken meal off their daily menu is a ridiculous deal. $10 buys you a plate of chicken and fries, a bowl of soup, coffee and dessert. Amazing.  Unfortunately there have been a few times when I've gotten food burned or underseasoned, or meat that is a little dried out. Nothing terrible, but there have been screw-ups.  Another thing that needs to be said: the service is just no good. Some nights the whole restaurant is served by one woman, in her 60s, who always seems distracted or disinterested and will only rarely visit the table. It's also not uncommon to have to walk into the restaurant past a number of staff members smoking on the front steps. Not crazy about that.  Here's some other good things about Angela's, so you don't think it's all bad news. The pizza is just delicious, I would personally recommend \"the Angela\" or a sausage and onion. Pizzas are big, good amount of toppings, good flavor, good crust, just a great pizza. The prices, however, seem a touch on the high side. But it is undoubtedly a high quality product.   Ultimately, I stand by Angela's as a good place to get a bite to eat, but I would really only recommend that you get take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"Constantly gets delivery orders wrong. Refuse to refund or exchange. Orders take forever to arrive. Very rude when talking to. Would not recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"You've got to be kidding me.  Ordered at 2:05am, said pizza would take 45min to an hour. An hour and 45 minutes later, no food, and busy signal at the restaurant.  Already gave my credit card. FML. This place sucks."}
{"text":"INSALUBRE!!! N'Y ALLEZ PAS!!!  Dirty, don't go there! Lisez l'article du Journal de Montréal du 21 avril 2018. Une amende de la ville de Montréal a été émise en 2016 pour installations insalubres. Beurk!"}
{"text":"Pizza, poutine etc. all descent and above average. But what not many people know is that every Thursday there's greek pastitsio and fasolada. They make them perfectly and many greeks visit the restaurant that day to eat. Don't miss that."}
{"text":"I went for the first time at like 4:30am and got a chicken poutine for about $10. The way they put the cheese makes it look like a pasta. The plate is big and you probably won't be able to finish it (challenge accepted?).  Another time, I order the hamburger deluxe. It was pretty fulfilling   I do find the place a bit pricey though.  They delivery till 6 (or 7) in the morning which is SUPER practical since nothing else is open!  They take credit card for delivery as well. They will take the number on the phone then you present it to the delivery person at the door. Also, be sure to have some cash to give the delivery person for tip since it won't be added to your card."}
{"text":"Delivery!  To our hotel!!  (we stayed at the Sofitel) Until 6 am?!  WHAT!?  Amazing!  Chicken soulvaki was delivered piping hot, really fast, tasted great.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"Attentive staff but occasionally will forget ice if you prefer ice for sodas. The 10\" pizza is excellent and filling! The other Greek dishes are a lot of bang for your buck. The \"chicken 1 stick or 2\" is the most preferred. Cocktail Hawaii across the road is awesome for desserts or smoothies."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a full star. DO NOT order \"pizza\" from this place. Not sure how what they serve is even allowed to be considered/called pizza. Lack of any sort of sauce and/or seasoned ingredients. I couldn't even eat this as a drunk food."}
{"text":"The quality of their pizzas have gone down a lot! Never experienced this level of cheapness in making a pizza, its mostly dough and a lil but if cheese, for the price it's too expensive. Everything is bland here and expensive! Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Probably a good place for some food after a night of drinking.  They're open late.  Tried their Angela Pizza and a meat pizza.  Toppings on the pizza were decent, but it's the crust that kills it.  Slightly too thick, very bland tasting.  My friends steak sandwich looked much better."}
{"text":"For the years I was staying at the Clarion on De Maisonneuve, when in Montréal, I would make Angela my last stop of the night.  $10 large, half-decent pizza and open til 5am... can't ask for more then that after a long night of drinking.  I've heard they have around-the-clock delivery... never needed it, since it's only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel, I'd always pick up a pie to-go on my way back.  It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's perfect for late night eats.  Plus they were usually quick about getting us in & out."}
{"text":"Horrible vegetarian pizza  The pizza is overloaded with toppings in a disproportionate manner."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.  24 hour delivery? Word.  Ordered at about quarter past three in the morning during a snowstorm in Montreal after watching Goodfellas with my cousin and a few beers and a couple of cigarettes of this kind and that. 40 minutes later buddy shows up at the door with a large all dressed, hot off the oven. Traditional Montreal style with the pepperoni under the cheese. Hit the spot.  Angela's is definitely on the radar for future latenight munchies in MTL."}
{"text":"Ahhhh ma Angela! Ma Angela c'est elle qui me fait des portions giga-mega-ultra-gigantesques pour que je grandisse bien (en tour de taille). Proche de l'université Concordia, c'est l'endroit idéal pour manger santé (dépend quoi) sans se ruiner. C'est un endroit fort apprécié par les étudiants! Les poutines et surtout leurs lasagnes sont à tomber! Ce n'est pas la présentation du siècle mais c'est vraiment bon! Certains vont se méprendre avec les toilettes pas très entretenues qui sont au sous-sol et malheureusement en hivers elles sont plus que glaciales (9 Celsius?). Mais je mange si bien que j'en oubli ce pépin!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and subs. Rest of the food is decent... We had the Fettuccine Alfredo tonight which was served quickly, piping HOT, and and nicely al dente (really saucy though, but that's how I like it). Open all night.   However, we just saw the owner/manager? Sneaking cigarettes in the kitchen while cooking pizzas and I don't particularly like using the dank basement bathrooms there :/ That won't stop me from coming back though!"}
{"text":"With very few pizzerias open late at night we decided on Angela's and we are glad we did! We ordered the all dressed with olives. The only reason it ia not rated 5 stars is because they didn't have dipping sauce for the crust."}
{"text":"In vacation in montreal and tried to order delivery from this place. They were so rude and it was such a hassle to get my order taken and then by the end of it all they refused to deliver because it was 'way too far' even though it's only 2 km away from my place. Terrible service. I wouldn't waste the time."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. Open late.  The staff aren't always nice - pesters you for the tip."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious pizza and souvlaki. My girlfriend and I eat there occasionally but typically order. They also have everything on their menu"}
{"text":"A nice little spot close to our hotel. Friendly and attentive service with a bit of training needed...forgot ice in the drinks.  Pizza was fresh and very tasty. With plenty of the toppings that were ordered. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza is pretty good and they have great hours, I love how late they are open! BUT they were rude to us and didn't let us eat our pick up order at their little counter, they basically kicked us out and it was cold and raining out, super lame. And the prices were way too much-$14 for a small pizza? Not cool. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Best 4AM pizza and poutine I've had in a long time! Great after-clubbing atmosphere, and the staff keep it together. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Fast service, good pizza, helpful and friendly staff... seems like a perfect neighborhood pizza joint, if I lived here I'd probably come in once a week."}
{"text":"Great spot opened pretty late in the downtown area!  the location had a nice older pizzeria look to it which is nice and cozy, staff are pretty attentive and the food is actually really good.  Your portions are pretty big so you clearly get enough for your buck!   I always get pizza or pasta and I can say I've not been disappointed yet!  Everyone should surely try this nice little spot hidden away near the Concordia University downtown campus."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst delivered pizzas I have ever had in my life. That is saying something. Ordered half vegetarian and half cheese, it was soggy, undercooked, and too salty."}
{"text":"Here in Montreal for vacation and wanted some pizza after attending a concert and hitting up the bars. This place was close by our Airbnb so decided to stop in and grab a small pizza with sausage and mushrooms. When I got the pizza i found out they put pepperoni instead of sausage. When I told them about it they insisted it was sausage and made up some BS excuse saying they're sausages from whole sale. The fuk? They refused to remake a new one and sent us out with whatever they gave us. Terrible customer service and the pizza tasted gross too. Could've bought a better tasting pizza at the frozen section at the grocery store. I ended up giving half of the pizza to a homeless person on the street. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Omg! 24 hour delivery! This is a great idea. I love to come here for the poutines! They are just amazing, especially the smoke meat poutine, it's to die for.  The restaurant looks like a mom and pop place with the checkered red and with tables. The pizza is great has well and not expensive. Sometimes service is slow because bar/club hoppers go here at 2-5am to eat. It does get intense but that's how you know it's great food,"}
{"text":"It's 3 a.m. and you and your friends are hungry for poutine, a souvlaki pita wrap, a cheesecake slice, a pizza slice and coffee, but where, oh where do you go to get everything you want in one place? Angela's can answer that call and it is the place for all of your late-night, post-drinking needs.   This place is open 24 hours and is a decent go-to spot if your favourite late night eatery has a line-up.   The food isn't that great but at 3 a.m., who cares. It's satisfying, filling and cheap, which is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Good pizza, decent delivery time. The dough wasn't too thick as is common for Montreal pizza, and the toppings were fresh. Definitely go-to pizza delivery downtown."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Montreal 15 years ago I have been eating here. It is good quality food at very reasonable prices. Delivery is available till 6 am I believe.  It is great because of its convenience. I don't think I will ever stop coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Alright, Pizzeria Angela comes in clutch for late night grubbing, I'll give 'em that. Delivery at 3:30am is absolute bliss. But spending $30 for two of their pasta dishes \"Penne Ariabata\" was definitely not worth it for dinner. We cracked open the dishes when we got back to our apartment only to find out we had boughten noodles with a minimal amount of sauce. It was literally a fucking dish of disappointment.  Boston Pizza does it right, they slap mass amounts of red peppers and sausage in your meal while Angela kinda' just slaps you in the fucking face.   You're welcome for the $30, you literally profited $28. Suck my dick."}
{"text":"The fettucini alfredo was one of the worst I've had in Montreal. Very bland and tasted weird. It seems that other people are having more luck with other dishes but definitely do not recommend the fettucini alfredo"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Me and my boyfriend were in Montreal for the weekend and found this place at 3:00 am. It was the best late night food we've ever gotten and we came back the next night. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good food."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I actually like their fries. Pizza is decent.  Filet of sole was over cooked sadly."}
{"text":"I come here quite often because it's opened so late. Honestly, everything is pretty mediocre except the FRIES. I think they double deep fried it. So good, much crisp"}
{"text":"Shit service!!! Called them and the person was being so disrespectful. No exp in customer service."}
{"text":"Great prices, open really late, cozy inside. Quarter chicken special is awesome. Some of the waitstaff tends to be very slow and distracted (taking smoke breaks while you're waiting for a check, or just sitting at a table and doing nothing), but I haven't seen them in a few weeks. There are also often some guys, either staff or regulars, smoking right at the door, so it's not great that you get smoke blown in your face when you leave. 3 stars because it's tasty and in the neighborhood, but not worth taking a trip.  Update: I heard that there have been some recent changes in the kitchen, and I think it was a great decision! Everything has tasted better since this happened, so I'm adding a star."}
{"text":"Try the quebecois pizza they have you won't regret it! Fast delivery and open until 6am!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Just got my order a half an hr ago. Worst pizza I've ever had. Poutine was terrible too. Nasty, just nasty."}
{"text":"Best poutine I ever ate in mtl. The staff is amazing, you can go there after clubbing to have the best poutine in town."}
{"text":"I came here one evening for dinner with a friend. Their souvlakis were great, especially the fries. However, other dishes were mediocre at best. There is nothing special about the place."}
{"text":"On vacation from out of town, we had no idea where to eat.. Someone recommended pizza from here. We called for delivery to where we are staying and they said they wouldn't deliver this far and to just go to the Miami diner. That should have been our first hint. We felt brave and drove to Angela's on a mission to get pizza. We arrived and ordered. 45 minutes passed and our waitress tells us there was a mix up and they didn't start making the pizza. WE WERE LITERALLY THE ONLY ONES THERE. To make matters worse, I got a parking ticket from parking right in front. I don't know French and don't know what sign I missed. I know I parallel parked behind a car and in front of another car. Guess everyone was illegally parked and they were all able to move in time. Maybe if my pizza didn't take an hour and if my bill/change came when I asked I wouldn't have this $60 parking ticket. Visiting montreal I've had the best smoked meat, bagels, and poutine in my entire life. I can't say the same about pizza. Will not return, but they don't care anyway. Never go somewhere that doesn't care for your business"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a bite. I had a souvlaki plate for $9 which was a big bang for my buck. I wish the staff was more friendly but other than that it was great."}
