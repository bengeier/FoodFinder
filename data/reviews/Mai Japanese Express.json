{"text":"Met a friend during lunch hour and it took forever to get a hibachi dish and some sushi.  The server came across as if we were bothering her.  All her attention was on the 6 top next to us.  The food itself was alright once we got it.  We basically had to trip the server to get her to give us enough attention to ask for the check.  It surprisingly took no time to get our money but she got no tip from me."}
{"text":"For $10 a roll the sushi is soooo small! I've tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt but it's just not worth how expensive it is."}
{"text":"Reviews haven't focused on sushi selection and quality and I'm here to tell you that it's very fresh and tasty.  I had the seaweed salad, salmon, white tuna, yellowtail, and California roll.  Only the California roll was average but I still cleaned my plate!  Also had a nice dry cold sake.  Don't let past reviews stop you from Checking out Mai for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!! You get nice portions of everything else when you eat in but to-go orders are very slim. Good is really good though - shrimp fried rice is excellent."}
{"text":"so I recently starting eating at this restaurant this past weekend  -the location is GREAT I love having  the option of hibachi & sushi for lunch since I work in the business park right across the street! 
As far a prices its as fair as it gets! they give you a TON OF FOOD and you don't have to feel you paid a arm and a leg for it and its still made with quality and care. I can defiantly see my self coming alot more often"}
{"text":"Ate w my girl Saturday.  $6.50 for chicken Hibachi!?  Absolutely awesome deal and flavor and nice fast servers.   Added a bagel roll for $5.50 or so.  $24 for us both to get stuffed.   Greatest deal around for awesome Japanese!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Definitely on the lower end of sushi. Small pieces with very little inside.  If I didn't have one of the \"buy 1, get another half off\" coupons, I would have been more disappointed.  Other food looked good there but the sushi was lacking. 

I ordered the Colony Roll and the Charlotte Roll."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Nothing was disappointing here. Really delicious chicken bento box, and the kelli sushi roll is superb as well. You won't regret eating their food. The only advice I have is to be very clear with your order because they can easily misunderstand what you say but otherwise this place is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst sushi we've ever had. And the hibachi veggies and the fried rice was tasteless."}
{"text":"Hello all my fellow Yelpers and Sushi Buffs, this was my first night eating at this restaurant, I arrived there around 8:30pm.  I was moderately full.  I was seated right away.  What I liked best was that you could see the cooking/prep area and it appeared well kept and well organized. I could see every piece of my food being made. I sat at the sushi bar.
My waitress was friendly, she smiled, checked on me and came over a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed and last, asked me if I liked what I had. That was a plus, I tipped her.  I just had water with my meal, but I started out with miso soup.Then I enjoyed a spicy salmon hand roll which consisted of rice cucumber, avocado and a spicy sauce that resembled hirachi hot pepper sauce but not eye watering hot. The hand roll was good and the seaweed broke off nicely with every bite.  Southside roll, which was flavorless tempura salmon & cucumber, rice side out. It was creative but they could've added a little seasoning to either the fish or the tempura batter and they could've julienned the cucumbers because they were thick. Last I had the Ocean roll which was tuna, crab, roe and cream cheese deep fried & drizzled with spicy aioli. That was good. I'd get it again.

Overall I liked the place, I would definitely go back and tell my friends to check it out. It's a nice date night place too."}
{"text":"The food tasted great except for the fact that my husband and I both had to run to the restroom directly after dinner. Not sure if it was the soup or salad but one of the two made us have major intestinal issues :( Sad because it did taste REALLY good but we are afraid to repeat getting sick, doesn't seem worth it. Sorry y'all..."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in over 2 years, but lately I have been weekly. The food is good, full of flavor. I have eaten their sushi for the last two visits and have been impressed with it as well. The best thing is the price. So reasonable!!! Enjoy this little gem."}
{"text":"I will admit that I am picky about my sushi, and I was not a fan of what I had here.  I tried a cucumber roll, a vegetable roll, and an avocado roll.  All 3 rolls were extremely dried out from the rice to the veggies.  I have my doubts about whether or not it was prepared freshly.  I've had better sushi from grocery stores where I know it sat in a cooler all day!"}
{"text":"This little sushi place in Ayrsley is good for lunch.  Friendly and quick service.  The menu is standard and they've got a good enough sushi menu to get by.  Prices are what you'd expect - about $7 for a roll.  They've got other non-sushi dishes too."}
{"text":"Quaint little place to have quick Japanese for lunch - though it doesn't offer 'fulfilling Japanese food,' it does hit the spot. Skip the ramen, get the 6 oz. hibachi or a few orders of nigiri."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and picked it up close to closing time so I cannot say how busy this place is on a weeknight or provide review about the service. 

The take out consisted of shrimp fried rice and three rolls. She misheard one of the rolls so we ended up with a veggie roll instead of spicy salmon. She offered to make it for me but the sushi bar looked to be cleaned up so I passed on that offer and was charged about five dollars for the veggie roll that had avocado, cucumber, lettuce and carrots (probably could have made three at home for that price). The food was packed up nicely, sushi rolls with fish were decent for the price. Fried rice was disappointing, won't be ordering that again. 
Not bad as a neighborhood sushi fix, will be back."}
{"text":"Quality and service are consistently great. The place has not been busy the 5-6 times I have been there for lunch and dinner. And agree the HOT LAVA is the best thing on the menu. Its sushi with a warm seafood casserole on top. Not spicy. Just yummy."}
{"text":"I love their sushi. I've tried about five different kind from here and have been impressed with all of it. Their wasabi is more powerful than most places and my head feels as though it will explode if I'm not careful. I kind of like it though. 

The salmon was tasty and I like their carrots. 

The only issue is that they will not hold the mushrooms. The waitresses say that it's all cooked together (with the other vegetables such as sweet carrots and broccoli). 
So? 
Doesn't a lot of places buy mixed bags of veggies? Have the cook remove the mushrooms anyway. It's not hard to do. I've seen hibachi cooks do this with my very eyes. I mean, if I can remove them from the entree after they've been cooked, why can they just not removed at square one? 
I've asked on three separate occasions and they will not do it and you have eat your food after picking the mushrooms out, making a tiny little fort of dirt fungus around the edges of your plate. You stuff the rest of the food in your mouth knowing that they were infused together while cooking on the grill with dirt wart residue, no doubt fertilized by the decomposed remains of chipmunks or beetles, making the food taste like three stars instead of 4 or 5. 

Fix your mushroom situation!
Update 8/18/17. I tried this place again after all this time and they still won't remove mushrooms at the onset. That's so stupid."}
{"text":"Mai's is okay. It's just okay. I personally live very near Arsley so it's convenient but if it relocates they won't see me again."}
{"text":"Good food! Small portions! I got the 6oz chicken and it DEFINITELY not enough rice! In the tray it only filled one little pocket! I was kinda disappointed but the food was good! Zucchini was good"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant 3 weeks in a row. It is the best lunch deal around. You can have the soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, and chicken for $7!!!!!  
They have sushi and other things too but have not had them. 
Give this place a try- it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Ordered steak teriyaki. Nice clean environment. I was starving and the food came fast. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't come here bc its only 3 stars but people are giving bad reviews bc the food wasn't made fast enough. This is not a fast food restaurant, this is a sit down, made to order restaurant. Food came fast for us & WE WERE STARVING!!!! Everyone at our table loved their meal, my hibachi was delicious, veggies not overcooked. Nice, clean, quiet, friendly... Managed to even play all my favorite music the entire time, weird!! Dish Nation on the Tele, five star experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restaurant in Charlotte we have eaten at Fuji and sake Express and hibachi Express and many other Japanese restaurants and this is by far the best one the food taste great the shrimp was amazing the chicken was great the only thing weird was when you walk in you think they're going to seat you but you just sit down and a little Vietnamese woman takes your order we discovered this place by accident because we went to Fuji at 2:30 and they were closed on a Saturday and I yelped it and we found this awesome Japanese restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow. So I've given Mai a chance, thinking I had visited on a bad day or something, but I've faced the last straw and it's time I give my review. I don't think I will ever be back. I don't understand how it has a 3-star rating.

The service was awful. Just awful. The waitresses scarcely visit and seem completely disconnected from their patrons. No kindness, maybe ONE smile, no sincerity or concern.

The soups and salads came out fast. The soup as adequate. The salad was drowning in ginger sauce. I could barely get through it.

My friends ordered hibachi, which only took about 10 minutes to arrive. They said it was okay, just your run-of-the-mill hibachi food. It was probably the only vaguely positive thing about our experience.

I ordered sushi, which I got 20 MINUTES LATER with no apology and a further mix-up, after my coworkers were almost completely done with their food. It was a roll with spicy tuna inside and tempura on the outside. I should've taken a picture - when it arrived at my table, it was literally buried beneath a HUGE pile of tempura. I think there was sushi in there somewhere, but it was also awful. I'm now hoping that won't get food poisoning from the old, disgusting fish that was inside. I couldn't finish it, even in my ravenous hunger. My friends also had ordered rolls, both of which were disappointing as well. An eel roll was about 10% eel and 90% cucumber. I've never seen such ridiculous, sloppy sushi in my life. The grocery store would have been better.

There was a couple next to us who had been there even before we arrived, and one of them NEVER received her food the entire time we were there. She had to ask for it in a to-go box after waiting 30+ minutes, and even then, she waited another 15 minutes for the check.

Speaking of checks - the waitress had clarified that we were splitting it at the very beginning. There were only 3 of us, and we weren't sharing any food. And yet, in the end, we got 2. The one that had been combined was missing an item completely. It took us another 10 minutes to sort out the payment process.

There was no politeness or kindness offered, even though we didn't show any of the anger we were feeling. Instead, just cold, careless interactions that left us with a horrible taste in our mouth - literally as well as figuratively.

I'm not giving my money to this restaurant again. The experience pretty much wrecked the entire day, and I hope it doesn't wreck my stomach tonight."}
{"text":"The service was not bad but we were one of three tables in there. We ordered sushi as an appetizer and it was fairly descent. The price fit the sushi. I ordered shrimp and salmon as my main meal and my wife ordered shrimp and chicken. The main meal was horrible. The rice is not fresh. The vegetables had a burnt taste like the grill hadn't been cleaned and the salmon was horribly over cooked and dry. The shrimp was descent but salty. My wife's plate came out with shrimp and salmon instead of the shrimp and chicken she ordered. They made her chicken and said it was ok at best. I will never eat here again and I would advise anyone else to be very wary as well.

In addition, after we told them out complaints with the food because we didn't eat most of it, they still charged us full price for it."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch because I work in the neighborhood.  Everyone who works here is very sweet, but the sushi is just bleh.  I'll keep coming here for lunch but I wouldn't make a night of it."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. They have a lot of decent sushi options and the staff is really friendly. There is a grill so there are other options like chicken for people who don't like sushi. The prices are very good! $4.00 for a California Roll and they go up from there. They also do takeout which is helpful."}
{"text":"Yes! This is my spot! Hibachi is very good. Ginger salad is good. The reason I come here at least 3xs a month is for the HOT LAVA ROLL!!!!!! Every sushi friend I have tell me over & over where their best sushi joint is how nothing can beat it. Then I take them to Mai & order them this roll. Not one of my friends have been able to say it's beatable!"}
{"text":"Despite some of the reviews I read, I decided to come here for lunch today. I ordered a side of fried rice and some sushi. My side of fried rice came out in less than a minute (which leads me to believe that it is precooked). It was kind of gummy. Finished my rice before my sushi even came out. Ten minutes after I finished my rice, still no sushi. The waitress did not come back to check on me or to tell me how much longer before my order came up. Seeing as how she walked by me several times and saw the empty rice bowl. I finally had to ask, to which she replied oh it's ready. Then proceeded to go do other things. I also asked for eel sauce and was given soy sauce. The waitress brought me my check without ever asking if I need or want anything else. The shrimp sauce was good. I definitely will not come back here."}
{"text":"At one time we were regulars at Mai. For some reason the service has completely gone downhill and no food is worth bad service. The sushi is fresh and tastes really good. Will probably take a break from Mai for awhile and try it again in the future."}
{"text":"Ok place. The sushi wasn't all that. The hibachi was good but don't expect the portions like if they prepare it in front of you. The location was right after traveling all day. It's not bad but I've had so much better."}
{"text":"Over the last year, I've been trying to find a half decent sushi location and so far, this is my favorite spot. The seafood tastes fresh, servers are friendly, and they have a great variety of foods to pick from. I also like that I don't have to sit through the hot and greasy hibachi performance for good hibachi meal. I'm not too much of a fan of the over peppered rice but the veggies and shrimp were amazing."}
{"text":"What a nice place. The kitchen uses see through walls. So you can see what and how they prepare your food. 

This place is roomy with tables and booths.  They only have one small tv but it is showing kids shows. I ordered a lot of sushi but nothing remarkable. When I left I was full but I dropped $35 in the place. 

This place is very homey and a place I would frequent if I were in the neighborhood. But it's not special or has anything out of the ordinary. It is a good place for a good meal."}
{"text":"This is a solid go-to sushi location. I've never encountered much of a crowd here, but I've also never had any complaints about either nigiri sushi or sushi rolls."}
{"text":"After living close to this place for years and never once going to check it out, I finally happened to stop in for lunch now even though I've moved across town.  Go figure.  Anyway, I wasn't missing much based upon my experience there.  

It was about noon when I stopped in and the lunch crowd was starting to fill the place up.  I was offered any open table which was nice (there were only a couple available).  The place was full groups of folks that appeared to be mostly from the nearby business park.  I sat myself on down and waited for about 5 minutes before I got my water, and then took a look over the menu.  No lunch specials to be found here which I found extremely odd given that this is obviously a spot that does a lot of business during lunch.  Okay, whatevs.  

I ordered up a couple of sushi rolls, which I verbally ordered and then was advised to mark on the paper sushi menu.  That was a bit absurd to me, we're going to waste a whole sheet of paper for me to make 2 marks?!  Fair enough, I followed the sushi ordering rules.   I went with one specialty roll and then a standard spicy tuna.  

The place was pretty full, yes, but I watched several other tables that showed up after me get their stuff before I did.  I know sushi can take longer but they had sushi too.  Plus, I was flying solo.  Anyway, the sushi arrived and it was about like everything else to this point, meh.  Lots of white rice on the outside, not a ton of stuff on the inside, and not a lot of taste.  It was pretty inexpensive and, as they say, you get what you pay for.  The whole lunch took about 45 minutes which is pretty long considering that I was by myself. 

Maybe the sushi isn't their specialty, I don't know.  There are also some other Japanese-ish dishes, hibachi and such. Based upon my overall experience, I was pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my house, so I order take out from here at least once a week! Love the hibachi, only thing is a wish they gave more vegetables."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch, the service was friendly and fast. We all ordered from the hibachi lunch menu. The portions were large (I ordered the 6oz steak) and it filled me up. The quality of the veggies and meat were fresh and had that wonderful hibachi grill taste! I would highly recommend this restaurant and go again!"}
{"text":"Food: Inconsistent. Mediocre overall. The only element that was above average was the shrimp, but I found pretty much everything else lacking. The fried rice was the worst I have had in a while - way overcooked, seasoning was off, almost like it was too heavy on black pepper, and the peas were unashamedly shriveled and tough. The jiaozi were OK.

Service: Perhaps the best part of the experience. Server was very reserved, but attentive, and refilled our drinks several times. 

Price: A bit overpriced I think. I do not believe a 6oz portion of this quality is worth over $10.

Atmosphere: Clean and comfortable interior, though the windows did not look clean from the outside. We were expecting the hibachi experience, but there were no grills in the dining area. Generic \"Now That's What I Call Music\" pop songs playing in the background got annoying after a while.

This place has a few good points, and some potential, but it is mediocre overall, which means it is unmemorable and not praiseworthy."}
{"text":"This review should really be 1 star but I'm being as fair as possible. I came with a co-worker during prime lunchtime and they were about 70%  empty, which in hindsight should have been a sign.  
 
Our drink order was taken immediately and overall the service was good, hence the 2 stars. 

I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the 6oz hibachi entree  as a combo with the addition of salad, soup and fried rice.  The best part of the meal was the soup and the yum yum sauce....yes you read that right. 

In a nutshell: the chicken was lacking flavor, hard, and dry, the salad was drowned in the ginger dressing, the veggies were overcooked and the sushi was just a mushy mess.  The carrots in the mixed veggies seemed to be honey glazed carrots that were added to the other veggies at the last minute.  

I won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this establishment but not my first Japanese experience.  The server was great. However, the food was overcooked."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good for the price, service was fast and efficient. Two of the more expensive rolls and a large Sapparo for $25"}
{"text":"This is great option among the many restaurants in Arsley. The food is really good, well seasoned without being overpowering and plentiful without waste. Their sushi is good but not great. It is fresh but I believe they should vary the menu with new options to stand out. This is why I'm giving it a 4 stars out of 5. The attention is real good and corteous, the manager lady there has always been super nice. Ordering over the phone is easy and they have never mixed up or messed up an order. I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is horrible. They don't notice you've sat down half the time and when you finally flag someone down they get to you when it's convenient. Everything you ask for seems to be an inconvenience as they say yes with a loud sigh and eye roll. The server we had tonight was actually on the restaurant cordless when she brought our food out! The only reason we come back is because they let you order off the kids meal and it's plenty of food. Good food. Good prices. Crap service."}
{"text":"We went to our table and just as we sat down there was a giant cockroach on the floor."}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp hibachi. The fried rice was really good and seasoned nicely. The veggies were sauteed nicely. They have a white shrimp sauce that is good but very, very sweet. Service was friendly and fast.  I went around 7pm. And I like that they give you an option for a 6oz protein portion vs a 9oz portion even during dinner hours. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because their windows weren't clean...outside and inside. But the restaurant was clean and the food was really good so I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Small but quaint Asian/ sushi restaurant. Some of the best Sushi I have ever had. Not from Charlotte, haven't been back to try the hibachi yet. I plan to do that on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has some mixed reviews, but my experiences here have been very good.  The sushi has been fresh and tasty, the entrees are delicious and nicely portioned.  The prices are reasonable and the service has always been fast, sit down or take out.  I live nearby and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"1st time there and I had the salmon and veggies from hibachi and baked mussels for appetizer. My husband and daughter had sushi. Everything was really good. Will be eating there a second time."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here on Tuesday, 10-10-17. 
The food was very BLAND. The service was so-so. We were saying that it was not worth returning. But to top off this was the 25% tip that they AUTOMATICALLY add on. There was only 2 of us. They did not mention this so I assume that many add another tip to it.. For sure, not going back!!!"}
{"text":"Mai Japanese Express is my go-to place for sushi in the neighborhood.  I can't speak to the non-sushi items, but the sushi and rolls are fresh and well-prepared.  They may not have the variety that some other sushi places have, but the rolls they go make are solid.  Their sushi rice is flavorful every time as well, so it really complements their nigiri and rolls.  I've occasionally had issues with the tuna being less fresh than the other fish, but that seems to be a problem at several other sushi places here in Charlotte.  I also really like their ginger dressing that comes on the salad - I think it's tastier than a lot of other restaurant's dressing.

I always get carry-out here, so I can't speak to the service.  However, each time I've been in the restaurant was clean and the employees were nice. The prices are a little higher than some other restaurants in the area, but I think the quality of food is much higher and is worth the price.  Once of these days I will definitely have to dine in instead of getting carry-out."}
{"text":"Very slow service :(

Good food .  Will update if I visit again. :)

10/22 update:
Service was much faster but it wasn't busy around 12:50pm. 

I looked up my old tip only after ordering, oops! Hope they do better with the rice and salmon.

The hand rolled Tomagi plate was great. Good rice, portions, flavor.  Will likely get this again. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  I love it when a place has really gotten their gears greased and knows how to do their food in the most efficient manner.  Mai is located in the Ayrsley shopping center - hang your first right after turning in off of Tryon.  The parking lot has a weird flow to it, but it's one way and it seems to have a good amount of traffic in it.  I went on a weekend afternoon so people were out and about.

Promptly greeted and seated... the dining room has a lot of tables and booths in the perimeter.  We didn't go at 'peak' hours, but it was nice to have a quiet dining space and attentive service, but something tells me they can move people in and out of here pretty quickly. 

I was craving sushi that evening and went that route, but my friend ordered a meal (salad and drink).  Pretty impressed that the sushi didn't take that long to come out along with my friend's entree.  One pound of wasabi and a lot of soy sauce later... I was a happy camper.  I ordered the Sumo Roll, Spicy Tuna, and a Salmon roll... yeah I was a little greedy that night.

Overall, I will definitely come back and try there other offerings... judging by the extensive menu (it will take a couple visits) they have a lot going for them."}
{"text":"I did a to go order here. I called in and ordered the 9oz hibachi shrimp but I only wanted onions and zucchini instead of the plethora of vegetables they serve you(listed on the menu),  at first the guy on the phone said ok. I then order the ayrsley roll but instead of cucumber I wanted avocado. I didn't think my order was too complicated but when there is a language barrier I guess it was. he repeated my order back to my incorrectly so I corrected him and he just put someone else on the phone and they told me I would have to get to the mix vegetables they can't seperate it out. (I hate mushrooms) I just said ok and was told my food would be ready in 20. When I got there, it was ready. Food was descent, rice was a little mushy (not sticky) like it been in a steamer all day but edible. the shrimp were good and nice sized. The sushi was the best. I would go back only when I feel like picking the mushrooms out of my veggies. I'll be back for sushi before I come back for hibachi."}
{"text":"We wanted to explore something new, and use a coupon from our Charlotte Citipass book.  Since we were getting our hair cut right across the street from MAI Japanese restaurant, we decided to give them a try.  It was about 5:15pm on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only customers in the place so I thought we'd surely have a good experience.  The place looked clean, despite the decor being too busy and distracting.   

We looked over the small menu and quickly knew what we wanted.  Since we'd never been there before, I wanted to try both the sushi and the hibachi options.  We ordered 1 order of California rolls, 2 crab sticks, 1 hibachi chicken combo meal and 1 hibachi shrimp combo meal.  The soup, salad and \"shrimp\" sauce all came out at the same time, which I wasn't thrilled with.  Then very shortly after that we got 2 orders of California rolls and 2 crab sticks.  I alerted the waitress that we only ordered 1 order of California rolls, and she seemed very confused...  so much so that she brought our sushi order forms back to the table and asked my husband if he'd marked the sheet...  which he had not.  I guess they re-used a previous sushi order form without checking it first?  Maybe they were trying to upsell in hopes that we'd just go ahead and pay for it anyway.  I dunno, but as he doesn't like California rolls, he certainly wouldn't have ordered them.  So she took the unwanted order away and shortly our hibachi entrees arrived.  They're served on plain, round, white plates which made the food look awful.  The first thing I noticed was that the vegetables looked oily, but not seasoned.  My guess was proven correct after the first bit of slippery, tasteless onion.  (So- if you like tasty, seasoned Japanese food, I'd highly recommend at least paying the upcharge for teriyaki.)  I was thankful that I'd ordered the sushi because I was less than impressed by my hibachi entrée.  My fried rice was just plain nasty.  It tasted somehow soggy and watered down??  I dunno- but it's the only time I've ever had inedible rice from an Asian establishment.  I got 4 sweet carrot slices on my plate, and they we're hard.?.  Like they'd been reheated in a microwave or something...  wasn't good.  The chicken was just plain, hard chicken chunks with very little seasoning on them and the zucchini and onion mixture was oily and tasteless.  I tried dipping everything into the \"shrimp\" sauce, but as it was mostly mayonnaise, it proved to be no help at all.  I wondered if they had any ginger sauce like Kabuto and Nakato have, but judging from the pale, watery ginger dressing I had on my salad, I didn't even waste my breath to ask for any.

Ok, so we finish and we're ready for the check.  I give the waitress my coupon and she comes back with my bill showing where they'd taken $6.99 off.  My coupon said \"up to $10.00 off\" and with everything we'd bought, I was curious as to why I didn't get the full $10.00 taken off the bill, so I asked.  The waitress just said she didn't' know, and stared at me.  Being as that in no way answered my question, I asked her to bring the coupon back to we could look at it together.  She came back with a woman that appeared to be a manager and she told me that they take off the least expensive entrée (which was my hibachi chicken for $6.99) so that did make sense to me and I was fine with her answer until she said \"...  that's how marketing works...\"  That comment pissed me off because all I could think was, \"well, actually, MAI paid to have a coupon in the Citipass book to draw business into their store and hopefully create return business and positive word of mouth advertising...  but after our experience in MAI;  that manager let a $3.00 question seal the deal that 2 fat DINKs (Double Income No Kids) won't be returning for repeat business and we certainly won't be telling our friends or the 200 employees that read my monthly intercompany newsletter where I share local restaurant reviews...\"  

I wanted very much to say...    you never once asked us how our meal was and then you chose to let your greed for $3.00 hold up many, many potential future dollars...  \"No, THAT's how marketing fails!...\""}
{"text":"This is very convenient to work and I thought the sushi was pretty decent. I made a substitution from salmon to tuna with no extra charges and everything tasted fresh. The maki rolls are very small;  the price (about $7.50 after tax) plus quantity (8 rolls) led me to believe I was getting a little more than I thought, and I was disappointed when I opened my takeout container. One roll was not filling enough for me for lunch, and a $15 lunch would not be something I would want to swing regularly. I would definitely return if they added some sushi lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place is deserving of such a higher rating than 3 stars. Another review mentioned that they almost didn't try it out because of the star 3 star rating and I fell into that category too.  The service was great, the sushi was fresh and well-prepared. I can definitely see becoming a regular"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on a 2 week business trip because we were running out of options for a quick lunch that wasn't fast food. This was the worst lunch we had during the trip.  Terrible service and terrible food.  I got the shrimp entree with mixed vegetables of broccoli, mushroom, onion, zucchini and sweet carrot. Absolutely terrible.  I have never had overcooked stir fry before, it was mushy and disgusting.   Shumai dumplings were the worst I've ever had.  My friend had a similiar meal, I think with chicken.  The 3rd party had sushi that she didn't really eat so I'm not sure what the verdict was on that.  On top of the terrible food, it was over priced so we paid $23 each for food that sucked and regretted wasting our per diem there."}
{"text":"The service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Food was very bland and did not have much flavor. I've been to other Japanese restaurants wayy better than this one."}
{"text":"Mediocre food but friendly service. I would not come back unless I had nothing else to eat. Tbh it just isnt worth the quality vs price you would be better off going somewhere else for sushi or hibachi."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! They always take care of us and always a friendly atmosphere!  Would suggest to anyone! If you visit- try the Hot Lava...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Long story short:  I just got royally ripped off with not one but two bait/switches.

Backstory:  Mai used to be on Colony Road and was owned by Japanese folks.  It was one of the few Charlotte Japanese restaurants actually owned/operated by Japanese.  You could go there and actually speak Japanese to some of the waitstaff and sushi chefs.  Mai bought the Ayrsley location from some non-Japanese folks who served pretty bad Japanese food.  When Mai took over, the sashimi quality obviously improved, but most if not all of the waitstaff had no clue as to anything remotely related to Japanese food.  Then, the bait/switch began.  Mai has maintained the same wine menu for at least four or so years, but if you try to order the \"house\" wine, the waitstaff will tell you that they are \"all out.\"   So, for the last four or so years, Mai has only stocked their most expensive wines and has not restocked the house wines.  Really?

I have put up with this rip off because the location is very, very convenient when I need a sushi fix.  If I have to pay a few bucks extra for a glass of wine, whatever.  But, this last visit sent me over the edge.  On the little sushi order sheet, I clearly marked that I wanted a piece of salmon nigiri.  I was served a very cheap cut of white fish which I ate without complaint due to time constraints.  But, I was actually charged for the salmon which was about $2 more than the trash fish I ate.  I was in such a hurry that I just paid and left.  However, when I return, and I will return due to its location and my sushi cravings, I will NEVER let them rip me off again.  Time to be vigilant with these con-artists.       PS:  The place is packed during lunch, folks seem to love their hibachi, and their tempura is awful."}
{"text":"I ordered two Philly Rolls, to go, for my unadventurous husband and got Cali Rolls. Would have been a minor mistake, but I verified MULTIPLE times on the phone Philly roll, not Cali Roll. Even went as far as to say, Philadelphia Roll. Whatever, we'll live. However, the rolls had plastic wrap wrapped in them. Not one, not two, but multiple pieces of plastic inside of the roll. Will never return, which is unfortunate because they're so close to my home."}
{"text":"Wow this place in my opinion is not good at all. I ordered a few appetizers for a dinner as take out and I threw most of it away. The veggie tempura sat in oil because it wasn't drained well before putting in the container. The pork gyoza was horrible. First most places pan fry but deep fry. The flavor tasted liked the pork was expired. The side salad with ginger was literally lettuce with nothing on it, the ginger dressing was fine. I won't be returning as simple appetizers should not be such poor quality."}
{"text":"This is a horrible place! Place is dirty, kitchen is dirty, smells dirty, sushi is NOT FRESH! As a person who dines on RAW sushi 3 times a week for the last 15 years. I know Sushi and this is not GOOD.  When we walked in a guy in the kitchen yells what do you need and I replied \" a server.\"  After 5 minutes we got a server. Our server was Daisy (at least that is the name she gave me) and she watched TV on her phone while we were dining, instead of checking up on us. After she served our food, she only came back to the table to deliver our checks. Never asked how our meal was, never offered to get us some thing different, never apologized nothing. Save yourself, your money and your time. If I could give them a NEGATIVE 5 I would. No wonder why the place was empty (only 2 other tables in the entire place)!!! Oh and they refused to give me the name of there manager!"}
{"text":"Dirty. Wait staff was slow, rude, and re-used paper menus by erasing orders with a pencil eraser. One teenage sushi \"chef\" dropped a bottle of spicy mayo on the floor, picked it up and used it, without wiping it off. Mall food court japanese would be safer."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mai.  I am picky about going to certain restaurants because I want to make sure they're clean.  Service has always been very quick for me at lunch time, once at dinner not so much, but average.  

They have a large selection of sushi.  I have had a slight difficulty with one waiter understanding what we were trying to say but that hasn't stopped me from returning.  The parking lot is a little strange due to it's set up but we always find a spot."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and hibachi. The sushi is a little pricey but it's definitely worth it. Good for lunch. Quick service. Overall a happy experience every time!"}
{"text":"Mai is okay. Quick, vaguely Japanese food. Not the best you'll ever have, but it's alright. Not the greatest number of vegetarian options, but the ones they do have are alright. Not the greatest service, but it's alright. Essentially, Mai will give you an excellent mediocre experience. Time after time - they're very reliable in that regard. Standard mediocre fast Japanese food. Go for it."}
{"text":"Just passing thru!

In town for business and found this place on Yelp. Nice atmosphere with some Christmas music playing in the background. The service was good. Timely and got exactly what I asked for. No delays. The beer was cold and they serve the large beers. 

The appetizers were ok. Did not care for the fried vegetables, to much batter on them.  

The sushi was off the hook. Everything tasted yummy and fresh. The style and presentation of the sushi was pretty unique for each selection of sushi. 


Enjoy."}
{"text":"Out of town and saw this place. Wasn't busy so we thought we'd get our food in no time. Started out with some great miso soup and the steak fried rice wasn't bad. We got our sushi rolls only to discover it wasn't ours. The waiter told us it would be 5-10 minutes. After 30 mins and watching 5 to go orders go out the door we got our food....it was horrible. We have never left sushi at the table. I told the waiter that the food was horrible, totally not worth the wait and to bring the check. There was no discount or apology for us waiting an hour and half for sushi!  Sushi was slimy and tasted fishy. They ONLY received the one star so I could post this review."}
{"text":"Lots of choices. You have to hand write your order which is coll in my book.  I had mackerel and salmon sashimi with a sushi roll that I forgot the name to? I had some wine and likely too many so, its all good. Quick service and great sushi."}
{"text":"Ayrsley is a neat little neighborhood that has seen its fair share of businesses come and go. This location especially, has been filled by several Japanese Sushi Restaurants; none of which have lasted. 

The void left by the last restaurant, Yotto has been filled by, well essentially the same restaurant with a new name and maybe new owner. Difference being though, we might now have a winning formula.

While the decor has changed very little, one thing that has changed is the food and prices. I still haven't tried the sushi, but everything on the hibachi isn't too shabby.

From what I can tell, the entire restaurant still has the same exact layout. I don't know if there was any remodeling whatsoever. Since it's a lunch oriented fast food style sit down restaurant, there isn't a dire need for aesthetics and stylish furniture. And those costs savings seem to have trickled down to you and I."}
