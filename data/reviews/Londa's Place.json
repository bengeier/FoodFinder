{"text":"I must say, the food here definitely reminds me of my grandma's cooking. I had seen other reviews for this place on the Next Door app and decide to give it a try. My mom and I was very pleased and very full. Not only that bumped into my cousin and her family. She frequents the place often. I will definitely be a frequent flyer, especially for those yams!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to visit this place after all the great reviews. Surprised at how empty the place was but maybe this after the lunch rush. Regardless, the staff was very nice and attentive. Ordered meatloaf, Mac and cheese and green beans. Also a second order with smothered pork chop with same sides. Got home and the food was still very hot,smelled great and tasted very good. Only ate half since its stick to your ribs but about 30-40 min later both of us were very thirsty, bloated and started to have the sweats. The food didn't taste salty so they must have used MSG or a lot of seasoning salts which can hide the salt taste. Been to other soul food establishments and didn't have this issue. Won't be back since I don't need that much sodium."}
{"text":"Food is very good but wait time has always been 30 or more minutes standing in line when I have visited. It seems that if there was at least 3 people fixing plates at all times the line would move faster."}
{"text":"It's souls food people. And it's close by on an end where there are few options. Good home cooked meals in a Christian environment with subtle gospel playing in the background. The people were really nice and courteous. Greens are seasoned without pork. Several of the desserts were homemade as well but I passed.  Banana pudding available on Thursday through the weekend. They currently close at 7 pm during the week and Saturdays at 5 pm?? So hopefully you'll crave your soul food early."}
{"text":"Oh wow when I went to my jeweler. I found this restaurant is southern food at its best. Everything is homemade. I cannot get over the food the macaroni cheese got the collard greens the fried chicken meatloaf the porkchops the fish I could go on and on and now the place is very clean the fit people wear gloves everything is homemade maybe a little more than what I would normally would pay but well worth it. This is the place I keep taking my friendTo and everyone that I have taken has fell in love with the place the owner is a very friendly woman"}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed to wait in line for 12 minutes to be told the fried chicken isn't ready.  Four people working the serving line and chaotic.  Need additional training to communicate with kitchen staff and runner.  No estimate on when Chicken would be ready other than \"soon...I think!\"  I waited an additional three minutes and finally left.  Owner unaware of lack of organization or scrambling gaps as she manned the register.

It is Sunday, the restaurant was less than a quarter capacity and quite disappointing. Clean and bar seemed hot, though the cold bar had mostly melted ice for the banana pudding containers."}
{"text":"We welcome Londa's Place to the mountain island area and we've waited so long for someone to reopen this location as a restaurant. Upon entering we was greeted with smiles and 2-3 employees spoke to us. 

The place smells like a thanksgiving dinner in the oven and tables and floors are clean as if nobody has eaten there all day. 

Everything was buffet style and the food was steaming hot and looked fresh. I had The Beef Ribs with Greens along with Mac and cheese and it was very good and it tasted very good. 

The sweet tea was good this is a must visit place and trust me there is plenty of food to choose from such as turkey legs chicken baked or fried pinto beans green beans collard greens and even stuffing they even have desserts to choose from. 

I know this is a big statement but I will say it's the best buffet served restaurant I've ever eaten at seriously."}
{"text":"Food was soulful and seasoned to perfection. Reasonable prices with healthy served amount. I had chicken greens (sweet) and yams and Mac and cheese. Plan on trying the cabbage. I don't care for sugar in greens but they weren't bad. Yams were good as well. Mac and cheese was my favorite side item."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a secret ready to be revealed.  The restaurant is buffet style (which they serve). One meat and two sides (majority of the specials/ menu) and drink included (I think). Prices are reasonable and food portions are good size. The atmosphere is dim in regards to lighting but very roomy. The staff is very friendly and pleasant.  Our family enjoyed their food on a Sunday after church."}
{"text":"I was surprised to learn that this place had opened in the old CiCi's pizza location.  It is cafeteria style soul food at it's best.  I was able to swing by after church just before they opened at 11, and most of the food was ready with the exception of a few vegetables.  My son ordered the stewed chicken over rice, mac, green beans, and cornbread and he loved it all.  I ordered turkey wings over rice, collards, and green beans....I enjoyed everything except the green beans didn't seemed to be seasoned that well.  I also ordered a veggie plate of mac, dressing and gravy, and potato salad.....all were very good.  The desserts are mostly cake, and banana pudding.  The banana pudding was fresh and delish and overall everything was good on my first visit and my order was to go.  This restaurant is not new to the Charlotte area, as they were previously Koffee Kup on Tuckaseegee.  As I was leaving, the crowd was starting to build as it seems the word is out about Londa's in the mountain island area."}
{"text":"The food and customer service at Londa's was amazing! Literally the best friend chicken I have ever had. I also was checked on during my meal, after my meal and had three different employees ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks before we left. I hope to see this place do really well with their business because they deserve it."}
{"text":"Just finished a very well prepared dinner of meatloaf, mashed potatoes/gravy and some good greens. Place was clean food was good and the staff was attentive. 

The only thing that could improve are the amount of people eating there. Seriously if you want an enjoyable meal make this a must try"}
{"text":"Londa's Place is a buffet style, soul food restaurant with a good location.   I agree with the reviews by Ashley D. and Chris H. Clean facility, courteous staff, wide selection, and decent prices.

My fried chicken was lightly breaded (not battered), moist and tasty.  Everyone has their riff on mac-n-cheese.  Londa's I'd order again.  Her collards, however, were good but I'm not keen on the sweetness.

Overall, a pleasant experience and looking forward to tasting some of her other fixins.  When in the area I say \"Give Londa's Place a soulful whirl!\""}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back here for dinner. I went on anThursday at 11:00 right at opening. Very clean looking restaurant and seem to have nice staff. Everyone was dress professionally and clean uniforms. I got the stew chicken over rice and two sides. Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. They had all types of green vegetables but I wanted to taste all the starchy foods. . I enjoyed my meal. Price was $10.52 with no drink. However the price was very good for all the food you get. Neither less to say I saved some for dinner. Can't wait to treat my family here."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm the first reviewer! So first, I'm so excited to a family style restaurant in this area and souls food on top of that is an added bonus! We found Londa's Place on Facebook and were lucky enough to eat there today during their soft opening. 

Trust me you will get your whole southern Black grandma in the kitchen life when you see the food selection. I was starving so I'm glad they had food prepared already on the bar. I ordered fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, cabbage, and sweet potatoes and everything was seasoned to perfection. The only critique is that the Chicken was a little dry but I'm not taking off stars for that since it was a soft opening and their first day. 

The staff were amazing and welcoming and accommodating and it gave me that family feel that should accompany any southern and soul food restaurant. 

I'll definitely be back and before I left I said a little prayer for the success of this business. Shine on!"}
{"text":"This a place hidden away in the Brookshire-Mt. Holly Huntersville area where the food will knock your socks off. The food is so delicious and good. It will make you rare back full when you finish eating. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yum. My parents and I went to Londa's Place this afternoon for lunch and they both were wondering why it wasn't PACKED because the food was so good. The service is \"elementary lunchroom\" style (you tell them what you want and they pile it on your plate). They have different veggies and meats every day. Your typical plate come with a meat and two veggies. I had smothered steak (on a bed of rice) with candied yams and green beans. Just like grandma's house. The steak was moist and juicy, the candied yams were perfectly sweet and the green beans were green beany. 

It is tucked away off of 485 in a strip mall with a bunch of fast food and pizza chains, but definitely worth seeking out if you're looking for a good homemade meal without the cooking or cleaning."}
{"text":"This soul food  did just that... It hit the soul. Made me get the itis  right after. The food was bussin. I will most  definitely go back to that jawn. The bake chicken was fresh and Alicia Keys Fallin  off the bihnon!"}
{"text":"For a first visit to a new restaurant you have an open mind. Was not needed. This is a place that the west side needs. Great southern food , friendly staff and reasonable prices. Generous portions and the banana pudding was the bomb. Definitely will visit again. Highly recommend a visit for those looking for the taste of great home cooking."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved how the young lady explained to me the different options of meats and sides they have as well as the drinks. Also, they serve big portions of food and prices are reasonable. I personally had the white chicken meal with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese and it was delicious. I'll definitely be going back to this place. The lemonade was really good too. Next time I should order two lemonades lol 

Oh and it's a big plus how close it is to the highway ;)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Mac and cheese, black eyed peas, collard greens, fried chicken and conbread. Collards tasted just like when my momma makes them!  I couldn't choose just 2 sides. Staff was very nice and helpful since it was my first time. Can't wait to go back and try the meatloaf!  Glad to have great place to eat on my side of town."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant I received a warm welcome, but as soon as I walked to the serving line I experienced a server that was obviously not having a good day.  I ordered the baked chicken, collards and cabbage (to go).  Asked the server for some gravy from the baked chicken and I guess she thought  I asked for one of her limbs.  (light skinned lady with a bad attitude)
The food was average and unfortunately I probably won't go again.  Attitude determines your altitude!"}
{"text":"Very good soul food!  Taste like home made...really!  Once they figure out how to speed up the ordering/serving process this will be hands down the best restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place but I frequent the gym beside it (lol) and I can smell the food all the time. So I went on a Sunday afternoon; it wasn't too packed but there was a line. I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and cabbage. My friend had the fried chicken was potato salad and Mac and cheese. I tasted both of our plates, of course! The meats(both meat loaf and fried chicken) were delicious! Both flavorful and the chicken was fried to perfection! I was disappointed in the sides though. The mash potatoes weren't bad but felt like they were missing something. The Mac and cheese was good but I like \"crumbles\" I guess you can say, and this Mac was more of a smooth consistency. The cabbage really let me down, they lacked the most flavor. I did end up re-cooking them and adding some seasoning of my own to it. The potato salad was decent. Nothing to rave about. 
However, the customer service were great! The ladies are so sweet and so nice and it's clean. If I were to go back it would be for the fried chicken for sure!"}
{"text":"Londa, herself has a warm welcoming smile, which is clearly reflective in her new restaurant \"Londa's Place\".  This soul food, home cooking almost cafeteria style restaurant.  Offers a verity of yummy options on a they service you, your choice style buffet.  I enjoyed their meatloaf, mac & cheese and mash potatoes with corn bread! 

My only feedback is, I hope they will turn on some music and/or get the tv's hooked up.  It's a little quiet environment without some back-ground noise.  

I should add, this restaurant seams ideal for picking up a \"home cooked\" week night dinner.  The food was great, prices where on point, parking is convent and with the food already prepared seems like they could get it packed and have you on your way in no time.

Welcome to the neighborhood, we hope you'll stay around for a while!"}
{"text":"Londa's Place is a nice addition to this side of town where if you want soul fool the closest you will get is Bojangles'. While the decor inside this restaurant is not glamourous one thing this place has is good food. I have been here twice now and both times I enjoyed the food. 

The first time I ordered smothered steak w/ rice, macaroni & cheese, green beans, and corn bread. When I got home the food was hot, tasty, and very filling. The food was seasoned just right and I felt like I was eating Sunday dinner. The corn bread I thought was a little large of a serving size and just a tad bit dry but it complimented my meal. The second time I went I ordered stewed chicken w/ rice, sweet potatoes (or yams...whatever you call them), green beans, and corn bread. The chicken and rice was delicious and while I think I received the last in the pan of the sweet potatoes they had great flavor. I still felt the same as I did before regarding the corn bread so next time I may try a roll. 

Prices are reasonable if you consider soul food prices at other notable restaurants in Charlotte. I wish hours were a little longer in the evening however this is a new restaurant and I understand they want to make sure they are getting an ROI. Both times I visited this location it was not very busy so I was able to order and receive my food quickly. I can say that both times I've been there the customer service was great. I was greeted and assisted promptly by the staff. The staff was nice and made sure I left with what I wanted. Customer service always is high on my list and in turn I can look pass the décor and other restaurant amenities you may see at other locations especially if you also have great food. I will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Great customer service ! The food was good. I took it to go and atmosphere appears clean and inviting."}
