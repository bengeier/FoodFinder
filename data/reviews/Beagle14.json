{"text":"Another brilliant place.  The best place for wings in the city bar none.  And as good as the wings are the boneless ribs are even better!  All the flavours are good, but I think the salt & pepper and the beagle (house flavour) are the best.  There are 3 locations in the city, but I think this one is the best.  The one in the NE is good also, but I'm not in that part of the city often.  The one in the south for some reason consistently has the smallest wings as well as the slowest service.  But at $.25 a wing/rib depending on the night they are the best deal in the city for both."}
{"text":"So far I 've been here for karaoke and it's pretty good for a Friday. But came here on a Wednesday for wings 35 cents night min is 10. Heads up !!! Drinks for pop are $4and not refillable on wing nights .Ordered the Mediterranean Blue Cheese wings and Teriyaki and some fries. Thought to order something different and try my luck and see what it tastes like. White creamy sauce ended up tasting not bad for something different and Teriyaki so far is the regular taste as other places. Fries were a nice crispy add in and just hit the spot for the night. I would recommend this place if one is looking for some great tasting wings that has meat on em\"."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his friends have always had a thing for this pub- ALWAYS- and I have been kind of dragged into it over time- but I have to say that I have come to like it.
I never order anything but 10 salt and pepper even if it isn't wing night ..I mean nothing on their menu really seems that appetizing to me but their beer is cold, the service & prices are good (more on this later), and the wings are GREAT. 
In my opinion when it comes to service at this bar - The NE location is the best, the girls are so nice and your drink will never be empty, The S location the servers are strange (maybe its just one in particular..so strange), 

Now the NW location is the worst- Let me tell you...
One night we had a group of 8 drinking beer, eating wings from about 7pm-midnight. One guy doesn't drink but wanted 10 wings on special. Well the deal is you have to buy a beer to get the special- Our waitress REFUSED to give him the wing special EVEN THOUGH 7 other people at that table had probably consumed  close to 10 beers each by the end of the night. So whatever, he paid full price for his wings. After we had paid, I guess the guy who had paid full price for his wings didn't tip our waitress (Note that the other 7 of us had!) She proceeded to follow us out to the parking lot and ask why he did not tip her- Embarrassed, he went back in and she stood there and watched him while he made a credit card transaction for a tip. Unbelievable!

Ive been back here a couple times since then and always have the same girl (We always are there on thursdays at the same time), her service teeters on the brink of intolerable at all times...

Just go to the NE location :)"}
{"text":"Best salt & pepper wings in town! The service is hit and miss sometimes, depending on which server you get. The salt & pepper wings are consistently crispy and well-seasoned time after time. Monday and Wednesday are their 25 cent wing nights and you can order 10 with every beverage purchase. On Tues and Thurs, they have a similar deal except it's with bonless riblets instead of wings.

The salt & pepper is by far my favourite. I wouldn't recommend the other flavours, personally."}
{"text":"Their wings are great and the servers are friendly. That being said I only go on Sunday and it is pretty laid back, nothing like the packed house the other reviewers are speaking of. The servers remember you and your orders and I have not met an unfriendly one. We have never had to wait for someone to come by and offer us another drinks or more wings. Great Ceasar special on Sunday. We are leaving the neighbourhood next month and will still come back here for wings."}
{"text":"Good wings if you can handle the service. Worst. Service. Ever. To be fair, the waitress with the short dark hair sucked. The other servers couldn't be worse- it couldn't be possible. A ten percent tip was being generous. Don't waste your time and money. There are other places to treated poorly and they have wings too."}
{"text":"These guys have fantastic wings. We stopped in on a Saturday night during a Flames game and had a great time. It was packed and we had to take a tiny stool-table in the corner, but we still had fun.
The wings were 25 cents a piece (not cheap, really) but definitely worth it. They were great. I like the salt and pepper wings the best but the teriyaki wings were equally delicious. The guy next to us had a club sandwich that looked pretty good, too. I met one of the cooks outside while I was having a smoke who told me they decided to get rid of styrofoam bread and use the real stuff as a cost-saving measure. (He was trying to be funny). But all that aside, they have perfected the chicken wing. Or chittin' wing as some prefer......"}
{"text":"A low key neighbourhood pub with great daily finger food specials ($0.25 wings, meatballs, etc.). I LOVE the house wing sauce, it's unique and especially tasty. Going to disagree with Nyssa, there is no rosemary in it. A sauce in perfect balance:  bit spicy, a touch of acid, moderate sweetness, and herbs (thyme and savoury perhaps?). A closely guarded secret I'm sure...

Can't comment on the rest of the menu as I always get the wings, but know that they make everything from scratch and friends like it. A place to hang out, not to grab a quick bite. West facing patio (but damn that apartment building across the street!) with heat lamps, and quite a few on site parking spots for this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wings for dinner two days in a row... I need an intervention. I was at Regal Beagle last night (Wednesday) for their wing night. RB has been voted best wings in the city by FFWD for at least 5 years in a row. (I only went back to 2008 and then gave up checking.) I love wings and was eager to check them out. 

The wings definitely deserve the best in the city ranking. Salt and pepper is easily the best flavour at RB, but the others are really good too. Try ordering honey garlic with hot sauce on the side if you like honey hot. They won't make honey hot for you on wing night, but it is easy enough to make your own. On wing night they charge $2.50 for 10. And they only charge $0.25 for side sauces. (I paid $1.50 for ranch at District!!!) There may be a 10 wing per drink rule, but it wasn't strictly enforced for our group. 

The service was really slow. Maybe we caught them on an off night, or arrived too early. It took more than 30 minutes for our first order of 50 wings to come out. It was hard to get our servers attention to order more food and drinks. 

I agree with the other reviewers, RB has a divey-atmosphere going on, and it works for them. The patio would be nice on a weekend or late evening, but during rush hour the traffic is a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"Headed on down to the Beagle on a Tuesday night for some cheap ribs. Definitely some good food there. I've been to a couple different pubs with ribs/wings specials and the Beagle was the only with rules regarding how many ribs/wings you're allowed to order with every beverage purchase."}
{"text":"This Regal Beagle location is my favourite.  

I love their specials (WINGSSSSS!!) and It's very fair that you're required to order a drink (doesn't have to be alcoholic) per special.   

Service is usually great.  Out of the 20ish times I've been here, there were 2 occasions where I waited super long for food to come out.  

Karaoke every Friday, I believe?  I had a bad experience where the DJ wouldn't let me sing Sarah McLachlan because it's depressing and said I'd ruin her party.  That's understandable but she was kind of picky with other people's choices too.  I mean, I totally get why she refused to play \"Don't Stop Believing\" because that song is ridiculously overplayed but things like refusing to play one person's song requests in order for no valid reason and ignoring some requests.

Overall, I love this place."}
{"text":"Regal Beagle is one of those places you might not want to admit you like.  The interior hasn't been updated in years and the place isn't much to look at but the food is addictive and the specials are always bringing me back for more.

The chicken wings here have to be the best I've ever had in Calgary and the \"Beagle Balls\" are also delish.  There is a patio (next to heavy traffic of 14th St) but we normally sit inside.

Service is a little hit or miss, but the cheap food and drinks will have us coming back regularly."}
{"text":"I like this place and wish I lived near Kensington so I'd go more often. It is a good, solid, neighbourhood bar. The tables and chairs have seen better days but that is part of its charm. They have a tone of cool signs and old random items all around and up by the ceiling which are neat to look at when you aren't making conversation. The staff are friendly and they do wings well.  I've never had a bad time coming here-it is casual and suits just about anyone."}
{"text":"I have to agree - I love the salt and pepper wings! Haven't tried any of their other eats but I can't seem to quit turning up here on wing night. It is a bit of a dive pub, but it works in it's favour!  I love that the crowd here is so mixed, this place doesn't have an ounce of pretentiousness. 

The service is pretty darn good considering the amount of wings this place churns out on a wing night. The staff here seem to be old hat when it comes to their busy wing nights - my drink never seems to bottom out before a server shows up and the wings have always come out piping hot!"}
{"text":"I like wings.  I like these wings.  I like wing specials.  I like these wing specials. Three times a week!  Yummy wings, good selection, decent size. Nothing wrong here.  Nothing at all.  Go on Monday night - surprisingly slow for such deliciousness."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken wings of all kinds. Plus great bones less ribs. I always forget how great the beagle sauce is- definitely worth yeti house sauce.  

The priced for everything is very reasonable and the specials are great value. Everything you'd expect from a good neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Great wings on their special night.  I recommend the S&P wings.  Decent beer on tap."}
{"text":"Hey hey fellow Yelpers, I'm back from my trip south of the border and I'm back to being my yelp-writing machine self.

Last night the boys wanted to grab a quick drink. I had never been to the Regal Beagle and one of the fellas I was with suggested it. Not bad, not bad at all!

The vibe is laid back and casual, and the staff is super friendly and accommodating.

I'm glad I wasn't having dinner here though, they don't have a tremendous vegetarian selection. However for those of you who like your meat, you will LOVE their wings.

Their wings are some of the tastiest (so I'm told) and most reasonably priced in the city. Plus they not only have wing night on Wednesdays, but on Mondays and Saturdays as well! Three wing nights a week??!?!?! How can you go wrong?

Just a note however: Wing nights (yes, ALL of them) get CRAZY packed. So if you're plannin' on takin' my advice on makin' an appearance at the Regal Beagle, then definitely get there early to find yourself some elbow room ;)"}
{"text":"Prior to meeting up with someone for the evening it was definitely time for a wing night.  As neither of us had been to the Regal Beagle, we decided based on reviews it was worth a shot.  The 1-drink-per-10-wings was an interesting rule to encounter as that's never been seen at any wing night we've been to before, but it worked out well enough for us.

D had a beer, a pepsi, and 20 wings - Honey Garlic and Beagle flavoured.
I had an interesting cider by Foundry that was a nice crisp dry cider, followed up by a Pepsi, and my wing flavours were Salt & Pepper and Beagle falvoured.

The wings were cooked properly, still juicy but crisp on the outside.  The sauces/dry rubs were flavourful and the Beagle ones were an interesting mix (our server called them 'all dressed' which suits well).  Next time I'd probably just get a ton of the Beagle ones, they were delicous!

It's a bit of a dive but the wings hit the spot.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Like to go for ribs on Tues/Thurs.  We always sit in the section on your left side when you enter the door, the waitress is great!  If you're a regular she knows whether you want a menu or not, if you're brand new then you'll get a menu for sure.  Lots of memorabilia to look at and it's pretty comfy.  Everywhere you sit, you will get a good view of the tv.  

Favorite flavour has got to be the Beagle, it's like the Dr. Pepper version of flavours, everything included and somehow tastes great.  The salt and pepper is also really good.  This is not a place that waters down or skimps on their flavour sauces.

If you're a biker, there is a super convenient pad off the parking lot next to the patio up front to put your motorcycle.  You can keep an eye on your ride while you have a beer."}
{"text":"Good times! 
GREAT wings! Went on a Wed at 730pm - standing room only at that point and LOUD!
It did not take too long to grab a table for the 4 of us and we had a blast!
Going around 830pm if you could hold off that long to eat would be your best bet for a guaranteed seat. 
Salt and pepper wings, nice size and not greasy at all although breaded. Very flavourful!
We also ordered medium wings which were dry sauced and OK. The Beagle wings are very good with a nice goopy house special sauce on them.
Pints are $4.25 on wing night Wed.
Maybe not a date spot but for sure a great place to catch up with friends. Service was great as was the atmosphere and the pub itself. I was told they cater quite a bit to local regulars. Good to know!"}
{"text":"The Regal Beagle is a bit of a soulless dump.  I don't understand the appeal."}
{"text":"It was the epic \"ringleader\" burger that knocked this average Joe joint into the 4-star category! Tasty burger meat and lots of it, piled high with fresh fixin's and onion rings, I couldn't have been happier.  

All the sides seemed somewhat typical. In an attempt to counteract the exorbitant amounts of premium grade Alberta ground cow I was about to consume, I went with a side salad. It was nothing to write home about, but who cares?! - My whole attention and appetite was dominated by the gi-normous ring leader burger.

Outside of that awesome burger, the Regal Beagle is another right down the middle local watering hole that you watch the game at because it's close. It's decorated with typical pub kitsch and beer paraphernalia that looks like like it could have been ordered from the stock \"Turn Your Building Into a Pub\" Decorations Kit on Amazon. *This is not a real kit **It should be.

The draught selection is also right down the middle for your average, non beer-nerd Joe.  Canadian, Coors Light, Alexander Keiths, and the likes are what you'll find at the Beagle. Enjoy it to an unassuming mix of 90's hits played in the background."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Good pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"Regardless of how busy it is, it's worth going on a Tues or Thurs for their awesome (and sometimes shockingly gigantic) boneless ribs, on special.  They have many flavors too, but the Beagle Sauce is my fav."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying: this is a dive bar. It used to be even grungier when it was known as the Regal Beagle. But recently the bar has had a makeover and reinvented themselves as \"Beagle 14\" , which I assume is due to their location on 14th Street. (I'm guessing they also changed their name because nobody under 40 got the reference to \"Three's Company\").  The staff are usually grumpy and rarely attentive, yet something about this place keeps bringing us back (plus the fact that it's just a short walk from our house doesn't hurt!).  You won't find any hipsters or posh craft beers here. But what you will find is friendly neighborhood bar with awesome chicken wings. Try the house blend BBQ wings."}
{"text":"They sure don't cheap out on wings here. When my boyfriend and I ordered 50 wings between us the waitress warned us they were pretty hefty sized wings. And they were tasty and set at a good price too - $0.25 a wing on set days. I like the set up of the pub, it's so random like bikes hanging on the ceiling and I love random. Unfortunately when I went they only had one server/bartender on Canada Day (I know that's crazy only one server?!) so I'm not going to count the slow service as anything, she tried her best! All and all really good food."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave beer and wings, the Regal Beagle is my top choice!  Beagle wings, here I come!

Honestly, that's the only reason I go to the Beagle, and the only reason I keep going there.  If it weren't for the awesome wing specials and delicious taste, I probably wouldn't have much reason to keep going back.  But, because I love the wings so much, and they're on special so often, I do go back... and I always love it!  They also have regular rib nights as well, if that's what you're in the mood for.

I never have my pockets emptied by outrageous prices or feel neglected by waitress or bar staff.  I never leave unsatisfied or needing more.  In fact, it's always a good time for me at the Regal Beagle.  I find the atmosphere to be very casual, as well as the employees.  They are professional, but still pretty chill and always nice and friendly.  The quality of service adds to the allure of this place!

So, if you crave beer and wings on a weekly basis, do like me and hit Regal Beagle on Wednesday, Monday or Saturday.  You can't go wrong with these delicious, hot and fresh wings!"}
