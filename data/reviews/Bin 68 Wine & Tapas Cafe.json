{"text":"My better half and I just enjoyed a wonderful evening at Bin 68! The selection of bruschetta and meats and cheeses were amazing. Not to mention Regan our server was very helpful and personable. Fun little place perfect for a first date or private little date night. We will definitely be coming back and enjoying more wine and cheese soon.   Thanks,   Bekah"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. Good wine selection. The service is what will keep me coming back though. The bartender, Elsie, was friendly, knowledgable, and very welcoming. She genuinely seemed to enjoy being there. Great vibe!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for this place to open!  My husband and I went on a Saturday night.  We loved the atmosphere and guitar player.  We ordered the shrimp and crab cake appetizers and two glasses of wine.  Unfortunately, our shrimp didn't come out until 30 minutes later and our wine almost gone.  There were only 4 shrimp, which were incredibly good, but only made us hungrier.  We decided to get our next order in when the crab cakes arrived.  Those arrived another 10 minutes later.  Three small crab cakes on a bed of spinach.  They tasted wonderful, but once again, not enough to satisfy.  When we said that we were ready to put in our next order, our waitress informed us that the kitchen was 20 minutes behind and no more food orders were being taken!  After an hour and $40 later, we left famished.  Might try it out again to see if the kinks got worked out.  Overall, had high expectations, but left very disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Been looking for a good tapas bar on this side of the city and I've found it.  We dined here around 2pm on a Sunday, was a bit on the empty side but that was great for us as we had incredible service from both the bartender, chef and what I presume was the manager/owner.    The menu was small but that's often a good thing, as it was obvious here that the kitchen is able to focus on a small number of dishes served with impeccable presentation and quality.  We had the Market Board which was basically a standard antipasto, three high quality meats and three great cheeses, served with accoutrement of pickles, dates, oranges and some fantastic toasted olive bread.  The range of textures/flavors was a welcome change and blended quite well.  We also had three of the bruschettas, again a fantastic mixture of flavor and textures (they have 8 or so to choose from, don't think you can go wrong... the tri-tip is certainly a winner though).  Overall it was a great lunch for two, and a couple glasses of wine on a sunday afternoon is never a bad thing!  Try the home made Sangrias :)  As for the other reviews, portions are small because ... its tapas!  Think tasting menu, small well-conceived dishes that you can graze on while enjoying the company of friends (and more wine).  I can see how the kitchen could get backed up with a full house due to the amount of care that went into each dish, as a chef in a start up like this once myself I know it takes a fair amount of time to catch rhythm but I'm sure once they've been around for a bit this place will be a huge hit, provided they keep the freshness and quality product.  TLDR; If you want to gorge yourself on a burger that puts you down for 4 hours, Red Robin is right next door. If you want thoughtfully prepared dishes that are both delicious and fun to eat, paired with great wines for reasonable prices, this is the place.  Damage: $45 bucks after tip for a solid lunch and 4 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Out of business.  Went by this weekend and saw that it was closed for remodeling.  Banner over the window says a Chinese restaurant will be opening soon."}
{"text":"We went there for a little pre-dinner appetizers and drinks. An Asian man with some communication problems was our server, he wasn't familiar with the menu at all but very nice. We ordered a Sparkling Sangria and a Prickly Pear Sangria, both were very good although we waited at least 15 minutes to get them with only two other tables occupied and three couples sitting at the bar.   We then ordered the brushetta with the chicken, avacodo and goat cheese, the pork and white bean, and buffalo mozzarella with basil pesto also the Pork Satay. The menu description of the brushetta and its toppings were completely different than what we received. Half of the items on the description were missing, it states that the bread is toasted and brushed with butter, instead it was dried out untoasted dry bread with wrong ingredients. Example, we order the roasted pork, white bean, sauteed summer greens,roasted peppers and goat cheese, and we got prosciutto(that smelled rancid), white beans(that half of them were dried out), and chopped tomatoes, on dried out bread. The other two types had missing and wrong ingredients also. Horrible!! When we told the server of the mix up, he first tried to say that the meat we got was pork, ummm nooo, not flying, he then said he would get the chef. He came back a while later and said that he would take the brushetta off of the bill, big deal as I had a coupon for the free brushetta anyway.   I must say the pork was awesome though, the meat was tender and flavorfull, although when the bill came I was charged $8 for it rather than $7 as printed on the menu. Bottom line, I will never go back there again and can't wait until they fail as a business, which won't take long and something new is put in its place."}
{"text":"Bin68 = bottom of barrel. Worse food and wine experience I've ever had. Poorest ingredients, limited and lackluster food menu...which is sad, because four new, good wines and twenty bucks at the grocery would really improve things. And, sangria should have a hint of fruit, not motor oil."}
{"text":"I have a feeling some of the initial poor reviews that were released  were due to growing pains, as it happens with lots of new restaurants. I think there's even been some shift in management and staff. I had a wonderful experience at Bin 86.  The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was tasty and served promptly and they had a nice selection of quality wines. My guest and I ordered a selection of meats and cheeses, which were presented very delicately, followed by some Bruscetta and beef skewers. None of the food disappointed.   I also got to have a really great conversation with one of the managers, Matt, about his history in the wine business while we sampled some delicious Red's and dessert wine.  If you've been here before and had a bad experience, I'd recommend giving it a second try, and if you haven't been, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came across this new wine/tapas restaurant on Friday night.  We were so impressed that we had to go back on Saturday night.  The staff is warm, inviting and knowledgeable.  This is the kind of place that the East Valley has been sorely missing.  I'm reminded of Sportsman's or Postino, but without the crowds and pretension.  I love the Market Board which lists cheese and charcuterie available for purchase by the ounce.  Be sure to try the Cana de Oveja cheese and the housemade Sangria - they're both outta this world good!"}
{"text":"First of all, we went to Bin 68 on the weekend of their grand opening. Basically, I think they may still be working out the kinks, but regardless, even if they did, it would get no more than 3 stars from me.  We arrived around 640 pm and had trouble finding parking. At our table of 9, it took about 15-20 minutes for the server to even bring out the wine/beer we all ordered. PS prices for wine range from $7-9 (just go to Postino- better wine selection and $5 wine specials). The wine selection is minimal, for a wine/tapas bar. It seems like for a wine tapas bar, they dont have much selection of those items, but rather sandwiches/salads as well. They had a live guitar player which was nice, and for just opening, the place was pretty busy. There is an outdoor patio, and apparently they do offer a happy hour. I may recommend doing that, just to get a decent value/price for the food.   When we did get our wine, which was good, we ordered appetizers. Our group ordered items ranging from ceviche, calamari, bruschetta, and the hummus plate. All were unremarkable, however the ceviche was pretty good. The calamari was over-fried with lots of tiny, oily pieces left at the bottom. The bruschetta was nothing amazing, although they did have a great variety of toppings (See! I said something positive!!)   Unfortunately, everyone at the table got all ordered appetizers, except for me. They also got their dinner orders. I never even go to ordering dinner because the bruschetta never came out until after people were done eating dinner (over 1hour after ordering). Fortunately, we had little bites of everyone else's food, but we didn't have an opportunity to even eat dinner, it just got too late. We had asked multiple times and our response was, its coming, its on its way... Finally we got the bruschetta, and it tasted just fine, nothing special. We ordered the Warm Artichoke, Strawberry Brie, and goat cheese/red pepper. You can chose a variety of 3 from a menu of about 10 and its $10 for three. In comparison, I felt as if they were doing a mock of Postino's menu and the quality of food and price for what you are getting at Postino just seems better to me. For a wine bar, I guess Postino has spoiled me.   Anyway, when inquiring with the server as to what was happening (at this time it was about 845 pm - a loooong time to not have any food), the server just said the kitchen was 'backed up'. I dont understand how it was backed up when everyone else got orders they put in after we did, but then she claimed the kitchen lost our ticket. I joked and said, 'well then I guess its on the house then right?\" She replied yes, I will talk to my manager, which I thought was nice, but I just assumed they would have offered or even updated us on what was going on with out us having to ask multiple times. Additionally, in order to get our water refilled, we had to ask. And when it was refilled, it was only my glass, not others at the table. I think our server just had a lot going on and many tables to attend to, however that is just a kink that needs to be worked out. In the end our bill was totaling about $13 with one glass of wine and one beer, not too pricey. We got our bruschetta comped and never saw or heard from the manager. I would think that if a server is comping an item on a bill the manager would definitely come over and speak with us, maybe I am just used to typical restaurant courtesy. Regardless, we got a free mediocre bruschetta and left hungry at 915 pm looking for where we could eat some late night food.   Not sure if we will be back even if the kinks are worked out, there are better places offering the same thing. I guess happy hour could be a decent value, as long as the food comes out on time. I wish the service could have been better, but all in all you can get what they offer elsewhere. (sorry, didn't mean to sound too harsh, just wanted to make sure you guys got an accurate account of our experience). The others in the party also were unimpressed and said they would give it 3 stars at best."}
{"text":"Was super excited to see a little wine bar in our area, sadly I will not be back. The wine selection was very few, and very overpriced for the area. We ordered 3 appetizers to try: scallops were small and dry, satay was just not good and the olive bowl was greesy and full of brim- nothing near the quality you should serve at a wine bar. We sat outside on the small patio area for a full 15 minutes before a waitress even came over to take our order. I can understand a wait if it's busy but it wasn't. Noone working was very friendly and not worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Go here because its close and I love Tapas style eating. Foods ok not the best but its on point. Also, never really that crowded and service is always very good."}
{"text":"To many negative things to write.  1 1/2 hours for a lunch and the food is not worth it.  Save yourself the time and money, go to Postino's."}
{"text":"My wife and I are so happy we tried Bin 68 for our date night.  It was such a refreshing change to the usual hang outs.  We had the bruchetta and let Tracy pick our meat and cheese from the MarketBoard.  He was right on spot!  Everything was delicious.  We had so much fun talking with Tracy and alot of help from Matt with the wines.  Can't wait to go back and bring our friends."}
{"text":"It's amazing how people are so quick to judge.....as if they all think they can do better.  I've been to Bin 68 twice and both times I had a great experience.  If you're looking for Snottsdale people then go there.  Service was wonderful and let me remind you all we are in east Mesa.  Tracy and Elsie were very friendly and I will continue to support them."}
