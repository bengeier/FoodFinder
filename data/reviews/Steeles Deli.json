{"text":"Great diner. Simple but satisfying. Service is excellent and so is the BLT."}
{"text":"The best club sandwich ever!!  Real roast chicken, crisp bacon, and as much mayo as you want!  The liver and onions is amazing!!  The portion is huge!!  Liver cooked to perfection!  Buttery soft and delicious.  Love taking my folks here for dinner!!"}
{"text":"3rd time at this place (previous times I've ordered sandwiches) which were alright, but this time I ordered the beef liver (which they claimed on the menu to be one of the best in town).  I don't know which town they meant but it was horrendous.  Menu stated that it's one big piece of liver and I got 4 skinny strips instead.  I ordered medium and they came well done and the waitress argued that it is medium and if I wanted more rare that I should've ordered rare.  Awesome... Because i will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the manager of the restaurant. I would not recommend ordering any food from this company ever again. I placed an order for the holidays and when I went to pick up my order I found the door locked and when called there was no answer. No food for my company for dinner on the Jewish holidays!!! This is no way to do business!! And when I called to ask the manager what had happened, he said there was an employee at the restaurant till 5pm. I was there at 3:30pm and found a locked door, lights out, and no answer to phone calls! He (the manager)did not offer any apologies for the mix up and would not take responsibility. All I wanted is an apology."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and personally I do not know why, the food is just at best OK. The meat sauce and tomato sauce both are strange tasting. Last night I got a egg salad sandwich because my fiancé likes the veal there so I gave in and went with him and even a simply egg salad is too much for them. I asked if it was just plain or does the egg have celery in it and the waitress had to ask and came back with yea, I was fine with that. When my sandwich arrives it was filled with green things in it and I was thinking to myself \"that doesn't look like celery\" the sandwich was 
filled with green onion! It had so much green onion I couldn't even eat it, you think if I asked what was in the egg salad they should of mentioned that there is green onion too... It's not your typical ingredient if you ask me. My fianceé likes the rye bread they bring to the table but only give a sample taste of a piece so he asked for more when his meal came and 
they ran out so he just got some white bread. When the bill came there was a charge for BR and we asked what that was about. They charged 1.00 for more bread, come on now how stingey do you have to be, and 
they refused to remove the charge. Oh well that was the waitress's tip. I will not be going back here in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Steeles Deli is one of my favourite breakfast places in Thornhill. I think it's better than Kiva's, and equivalent to Centre Street Deli (and cheaper). Although it can get quite busy on weekend mornings, the food is delicious. The place is smaller than Centre St Deli and Kiva's, but like most breakfast places, there's a quick turnover. 

One of the most unique food items at this place is the corned beef hash. This is a difficult item to find in Thornhill, but this deli has it, and it's delicious. The deli specializes in other sandwiches and has a great breakfast menu too.

I would recommend this place to anyone. It's great, and I will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been going there for over 10 years and am not planning on stopping any time soon. Their menu is full of variety, from sandwiches to ribs, teriyaki to shish kebabs. I would normally stay away from places with that much variety, but everything they make tastes impeccable. Their matzo ball soup is to die for, I actually just went in to get one specifically as take out. The staff are unbelievably nice and always happy to serve you. The crowd varies, with mostly seniors, but don't be turned off by that. It makes for a very cozy atmosphere :) I absolutely recommend it and think everyone should try it out! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Food:  big portions and delicious!
Manager: Sweetheart!  Good customer service and quick!  Be nice to her and you will have smiles back.  You get what you give.
My favourite: Greek Salad is the better than the Danforth; The smoked meat sandwich is delicious, Fries are really good too; Potato Pancakes yum, all the Jewish-style dishes are also very delicious!  

It does remind me of a 50's style restaurant.  Tons of older people there so you might run into your grandparents.  But, I really don't have anything bad to say.  Been there many times and still enjoying the food and service there."}
{"text":"The food portions here are quite large so either be prepared to eat or bring what you can't finish home. The decor is quite dated but still charming. It would be nice however if they updated their washrooms, which are showing signs of wear. There is only one washroom each for men's & women's. I had the salmon omlette which was quite large and a tad salty for me. The homefries which came with the omlette were delicious however. I tried a small piece of my mom's pancakes which were so yummy.  This place was better than the Sunset Grill on Yonge & Eglinton."}
