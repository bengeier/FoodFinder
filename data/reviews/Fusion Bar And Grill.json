{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious. Service was amazing. I will definitely be back. We came on for lunch and we were greeted immediately. The menu has a nice selection"}
{"text":"Best taste and value if you want to eat in the city of Pittsburgh. Delicious food and flavors, doesn't matter if you get steak, chicken, lamb, vegetables- everything is THAT good.

My girlfriend and I went to Fusion a few weeks ago and returned last night. Fusion was her first exposure to Indian foods and it was a home run. I also got the Jalapeno Bacon Burger- it was a 5/5 in taste! They got some awesome spicier Indian dishes available too- I'm a big fan of the Kebabalicous Plate. Second time I came here I got the Chicken Tikka Fajitas which were amazing- but I also tasted the Butter Chicken over rice and it was also incredible and comparable to the Chicken Tikka fajitas that I got! 

We got the Chili Chicken first as an appetizer which were a great little side, they really hit the spot.

This place was packed around Happy Hour time each time we visited.

A Pittsburgh Ace in cuisine. Affordable. Clean. Good Service. Foreign Tastes that don't disappoint. 

Bottom Line- This perfect deserves a perfect rating and that is exactly what it gets from me. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I see what they're trying to do here. The execution, however, is what begins to falter. The venue is clean inside, with a large bar. The lighting is a bit harsh. There was no music playing, which was a bit strange but not bothersome. 
Now, he menu is where I found myself most confused. If you're trying to go fusion, I think you should commit, and this menu was completely disjointed. The ideas were there sometimes; Indian pesto on pasta? Paneer fajitas? Great! But those were the majority of the \"fusion\" selections on the menu. Everything else was mostly run of the mill bar fare, with a couple pure Indian dishes thrown in. 
My fianc√© and I had the All-American Burger and the Tikka Paneer, respectively. His burger was cooked well and tasted fine, and he enjoyed the grilled bun; the toppings were lackluster. My Paneer was enjoyable. As for the naan that accompanied it, I'm guessing it was pre-made/store bought, and I'm positive that it was underdone. 
So overall, the food wasn't terrible, but also not spectacular, and the menu needs a serious revision to live up to the restaurant name."}
{"text":"Visiting some family in Pittsburg and heard about this place from my cousins. Love the Indian fusion concept and glad we stopped by!

Wish I had taken a pic of the menu, but it has a lot of neat Indian influenced dishes as well as solid bar/grill items. We started with the samosas and chili chicken. Both were on point, crispy and spicy. Of course I had to try the Indian Pesto which was fresh, creamy and delicious. My husband ordered the Kebabalicous Plate and wow it was awesome! Everything was cooked/charred perfectly and more than enough for 2-3 people. Also the waiters were friendly and knowledgeable about the daily food and drink specials which is always a plus. 

Fun place to enjoy some great food, just wish we had a place like this in my hometown! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out a new restaurant in Harmarville aka fusion. It's a Tuesday night around 7 & we are completely the only ones in the restaurant. Small town understandable but for some reason just awkward. We sat down I'm guessing our server was the owner~ just gave off that vibe~ I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich and he ordered a cheeseburger. I am very picky so after I ordered I got nervous but literally said to him right after we ordered \"you can't mess up a grilled chicken sandwich\". I was wrong- I tried to cut the sandwich when it came and I thought perhaps the knife was just dull but, no the chicken was hard as a brick and i tried eatting it but it was so difficult to tear apart or chew. Only to make matters worse we realized a little after placing our order she never asked my boyfriend how he would like burger cooked and low and behold it came out mooing, granted he doesn't mind he's the opposite of me- not picky at all. It looked as if it hit the grill for a solid minute. Sadly, i can't see us ever returning but- bright side the fresh cut fries were great!"}
{"text":"If you like a mix of American and Indian flavors this place is perfect.  Good prices and great food.  Very good service and good drinks.  I had a Fiery chicken salad and my buddies had a chicken fajita and pork sandwich.  All of them were really tasty.  Great place for lunch or dinner, not a \"biker or white trash\" bar so if you are looking to get blitzed and smoke inside go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fusion Bar & Grill has a small but good menu with Indian, Mexican and American entrees. Two of us had hamburgers which were excellent. The fries were delicious. Our other friend had mushroom and chicken fajitas that she raved about.  The service was excellent - they were very willing to make substitutions, etc.  They have a Friday lunch buffet of Indian dishes.  I hope the restaurant does well."}
{"text":"Lovely people - we had two very good indian dishes. Lamb and Paneer tikka masala. Avoid the rest stops and come here instead! 2 min off the highway..."}
{"text":"Okay first off, when you open a new bar & want people to come you need to have certain things, like cold beer (not like warm) drinks that are popular and or bartenders that know how to make them, and when you pay cash....they ask you for your name like starting you a tab...COME ON! BRAND NEW BAR, TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT RIGHT OFF THE BAT"}
{"text":"The menu was disappointing. Ended up with just an appetizer. Waitress didn't have a clue. Served on dinner plates from the 70's. The bright spot was a cheap draft. Sad that businesses that go into that location have no idea who their customer is. No business ever stays since Sam Morgan's."}
{"text":"By far the best hangout place in Pittsburgh! Ordered a few of their apps and entrees to share with friends, and everything was delicious! Possibly the best Indian food I have tasted! The staff was friendly and helpful. And the drink specials were defintely a bonus! All around a great environment, friendly staff, and amazing food and drinks! Defintely a must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was good, draft beer is watered down. I ordered a burger . It was ok. Nothing great. Hubby ordered kebabalicous lamb. It was good. Spicy."}
