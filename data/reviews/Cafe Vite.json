{"text":"Staff are very friendly. This is a place for Vietnamese food but I ordered all flavor in one ice cream cone today,  I loved it!"}
{"text":"The space is pretty small but it very clean. I prefer spring rolls. One more good point, the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Clean and flavorful homemade style pho. Banh mi was also delicious. The waitresses were very friendly and attentive. They also have homemade gelato. The location is very small but I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! New place. Small but clean. Very fresh and tasty! Pho small but among the best I've had ! Iced coffee also had great flavour! Spring rolls not bad either .. overall very impressed and I'm hard to please"}
{"text":"Ice-cream = 4 stars Food = 3 stars  My family and I were in the area and saw this restaurant has a Five-Stars rating on Yelp! so we drove by to try it.  A bit disappointed with the food quality - we ordered the fresh spring rolls and the fried rolls.  It took about 20mins for the food to come.  I had better rolls at other places.  The fresh rolls came with shrimps that are not fully peeled off, the vegetables were ok but not the freshest.    The ice-cream was good.  But the pictures on Yelp! were not accurate - they don't offer the 5-scopes ice-cream as shown on the cover pictures.  Overall the server was friendly and he place is clean.  If you are around the area, drop by for the ice-cream."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5/5. Firstly, YES they are actually vietnamese! I have never written a review before, but this place was good I had to.   I was impressed with the place before I even got my food. The atmosphere is very clean and cozy, the drinks were absolutely amazing. We got the peach iced tea, which comes with real peaches, it was so good. We also had vietnamese latte which was also delicious and authentic!  Then the food came, everything was delicious. We had both the banh mi and pho. And to finish we had gelato.   The service really made everything though. The staff is extremely friendly and generous! I would highly recommend this place.  The .5 lost would be the selection of pho, there is only one option and as good as it is I wouldve liked to add more toppings (I.e. tendon). Also, it came with a limited side of vegetables (bean sprout and basil), I had to request for more. But that was my only complaint. Everything else was perfect!"}
{"text":"I walked by and entered coz I saw the promotion of free banh mi for first 20 persons. I tried Pulled Chicken Banh Mi and it was delicious. Yup. It was free too . I also tried their gelato, the pitaschio flavor, which was really nice. I would like to try their Beef Pho next time"}
{"text":"The food and the dessert are very good!!! I love it My friend and I tried their homemade chicken and pork banh mi  It was very tasty!!! Also,their dessert are handmade  Very fresh !!! Good to visit here!! Their service are perfect too!"}
{"text":"I did try all of them.good food in there.im est everyday.good services. I love them."}
{"text":"Authentic tasting spring rolls and pho with fresh noodles.  Super friendly staff, very helpful and explained a lot. Thai iced tea was amazing!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with two other friends. It's an extremely hot day and I was pleasantly refreshed with a peach sweet tea (so GOOD). I had the pulled chicken banh mi - very tasty and the bread was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.   Perfect spot for lunch, the two ladies running it were so kind and helpful. I would highly recommend this place everyone I know and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very authentic and fresh tasting Vietnamese spring rolls, Banh Mi (hubby had chicken sandwich while they customized a beef sandwich for me), Beef Pho noodle soup and Beef rice meal ...all which gave me memories of my trip to Ho Chi Minh.  Fresh tasting Gelato, the fruity flavours were specially amazing. Refreshing  peach ice tea and Vietnamese iced coffee. They have combos of meals + drink. Menu is small since everything is made fresh.   Very warm service from Vietnamese owners Tracy and Van who prepare and serve the food, drinks and gelato with passion and pride.  They want to focus on quality and freshness so only limited quantity is prepared per day and they will close early. They are open to customize your order if possible to make sure you enjoy. Gelato is homemade so flavours will change and can depend on fruits in season. They eill happily let you try the flavours before you make your choice.   Quality and taste of the food, drinks and gelato are top notch. Worth the price and wait. We discovered this place yesterday and have been back twice! This is the type of local neighborhood food place our community needs! Thanks Tracy and Van- hope you keep it up.   Btw, place is clean, and well spaced considering the small size. Max of 15 people and kitchen service will probably slowdown if there are 10 guests at one time."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here tonight. We ordered their combos 3 (pho + drink) and combo 5 (pho + spring roll + drink). The pho was great! Soup base was delish but my complaint is the portion size...definitely small. The spring rolls, according to my hubs, was good too...not the generic ones. Apparently it's made with 13 ingredients (as per the owner). Our drinks were thai iced tea and the peach iced tea. Both were very good! The best part of the night was the gelato. We ordered pistachio and coconut. Pistachio flavour was so good!!!! Their coconut flavour had coconut meat in it. They'll let you try the flavours if you can't decide.   We had a little chat with the owners at the end of the night and you can tell how much passion they have for what they're doing. They told us everything in their store is made fresh with authentic Vietnamese flavours. They bake their own baguettes each day for the bahn mi and pho is their homemade recipe. They've opened for only 6 weeks and are still playing around with their menu. So don't let the limoted options stop you from visiting.   Will we be back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Walked by this unassuming restaurant and didn't think much of it until I went online and saw all these positive reviews. I was craving pho so I decided to give this place a try.  When I went in, I noticed the restaurant is really small. There's only about 4-5 tables, not good for groups! It's good for 1-2 people overwise I can't imagine how long you'd have to wait for a table. The wait time from when you order to receiving your food is about 30 minutes. I went for take out and honestly, 30 minutes for take out is WAY TOO LONG. They are new though so probably working things out and hopefully later on, the wait time will be reduced to 15 minutes or less.  I ordered two phos, one bbq pork banh mi, one fried spring roll, and one peach tea. The pho was actually very good. I didn't know what to expect since this place is a \"cafe\" and there's only one type of pho on the menu. Usually Vietnamese restaurants give you multiple choices. However the beef pho which came with beef slices and beef balls was very tasty. I  enjoyed the soup and the portion size was great. Pho was $9.99 but you can also get a combo which includes one spring roll and one drink for $15.99. The spring roll and the peach tea were both good. My total including the bbq pork banh mi was $35. Not bad and definitely very good food. They also serve gelato made fresh daily. I will have to come back for that next time."}
{"text":"This is a cute addition to the Yonge/Finch area.  It serves primarily Vietnamese cuisine, including banh mi, pho, Vietnamese coffee, spring rolls, etc.  They also serve several flavours of gelato, including mango, coconut, raspberry yogurt, mixed berries, lime, pistachio, coffee, mint chocolate, chocolate, and I don't recall if there were others.  Anyway, the raspberry yogurt and the coconut were our faves! You can also sample first before choosing.  It's a very small cafe that has seating for approximately 15 customers. It's clean and the service is friendly and attentive.  We ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and two gelato scoops.  It came up to about $13.  We thought it was a but pricey at first, but there aren't too many places with gelato around so it was worth a try. Plus, the prices are comparable to other restaurants near by.  The banh mi was good--crispy from being pressed like a panini and flavourful.  It would be nice to have a takeout menu though, but maybe that's in the works since this place is still quite new. Plus, there aren't that many items on the menu.  I'd definitely try this place again--next time to try their pho and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - Cafe Vite is amazing!!!  This is a surprise because when you pass by this unassuming place, it doesn't seem that it would be this good: it's small (maybe fits 15-20 people max), has a limited menu (between my wife and I, we've tried 90% of the offerings over our 5 visits there), is a 2-person operation so orders take time to prepare (especially since everything is freshly made), and it's called \"cafe\" (which, if we're being honest, is a huge red flag if you want quality/authentic Vietnamese food).  But wow does Cafe Vite deliver. As I've said, we've tried almost everything on the menu and here's a quick review: - Banh Mi: We've had banh mi chicken, egg, and even beef (not on the menu but the owners made it for us upon request). The chicken/beef tasted good, the veggies freshened up the taste, but the real star of this sandwich was the banh mi bread. It was crisp on the outside but nice and soft on the inside - perfect! - Beef Pho: Noodles were the perfect texture, beef strips and beef balls were a good flavour and added weight to the dish (though wished there was a bit more), and the base pho broth was aromatic. - Rotisserie Chicken: Really well done! Deep fried, the taste not only stays on the crispy skin but seeps through into the meat so that there's flavour all throughout as you bite into the chicken. You think this would compromise the cook of the meat, but no, the chicken definitely remains juicy. - Braised Beef: The slices of beef are similar to the one in the beef pho, so tastes as good. Also, the rice is so good! I know that sounds a bit silly to say, but it's not just plain rice (it's like they put some flavouring and spicing on it to make it pop). - Spring Rolls: We've had this both fried and fresh and both ways are great compliments to the rest of the meal. The fried ones are done perfectly (not oily at all), and the fresh ones are really fresh and crisp (no stale veggies here). - Gelato: Homemade and oh-so-many flavours! We've tried almost all of them and our favourites are the wild cherry, peach, coconut and chocolate ones. Perfect for sunny (and not so sunny) days! - Drinks: Don't sleep on the drinks. If you love Vietnamese coffee, they make their latte with it. They also have pretty good Thai iced tea. But hands down the best drink is the Peach Tea - a definite must-try! - Vermicelli: This isn't on the menu yet (though may be starting July), yet they made it for us since they had the ingredients that day. So good and authentic!!! The noodles were rolled very fine, the fried spring rolls were nice and crispy, and the fish sauce was oh so authentic.   As you can see, my wife and I loooove Cafe Vite. And I just wanted to give a shout out to Tracy and Van - they've made this seemingly nondescript cafe a truly memorable place with their passion, friendliness and excellent cooking skills. Hope this little cafe lives on forever because it truly is a wonderful place."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation, the chef put lot of effort hand craft Gelato. The Pho soup is the best one I ever had.  Also, chef special order Thai lose tea leaves from Thailand.  I enjoy everything in this cute little Cafe Vite because their warm welcoming service, keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the servers are awesome, Vietnamese real authentic PHO will be back again for sure and luckily I got interview by the famous vietnamese newspaper when I first came here. Love this place, and Love Miss Van for her best service"}
{"text":"Must try the food and drink in here. Pho and banh mi are very delicious. Friendly customer service."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most authentic Vietnamnese places I've been to on Yonge street. For those of you who love a bowl of authentic pho with beef balls and slices of beef this is the place to go.   Located next to a new bubble tea place, this cafe is quite small and cozy. (For those of you who are driving it may be a little hard to find parking as it is located on the main street.) When we first walked in we were greeted by one of the owners/chefs and were seated immediately. The menu itself is quite small as they have been open for only 7 weeks, however it has the typical pho, bahn mi and vietnamnese drinks. The waitresses were very helpful in terms of answering our questions about the food and drinks.  My mom and I settled for a Pho Combo with a drink and a Banh Mi combo with a drink. We ordered the Thai iced tea and the Peach tea. They were both very good as they are made from scratch (rather than other restaurants which may use powder or syrup). The pho's broth was rich in flavors while the beef was thinly sliced and the beef balls were chewy (in a good way). The Banh Mi had a crispy baguette which was different from the generic ones you see outside. It tasted very good as it was homemade and they perfectly seasoned everything inside and added their own vietnamnese style to it. Overall all the food was good as it was all homemade, and the owners themselves uses their own recipes and fresh ingredients. They also have homemade gelato too but I havent gotten the chance to try it yet as I was so full after my meal.  For the both of our combos it came out to around $30 which is a bit on the pricier side. However most restaurants on Yonge street are around this price too, so I personally thought this was worth my money as I also got a drink.    I would definitely come back to this cafe again and try out dishes. For any foodies out there this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"New hidden gem in the neighbourhood!!!   We had the beef pho...so fresh and flavourful....it's like grandma cooking.  The gelato is home made....oh my goodness...it reminds me of Rome.  They let us try all flavours and we settled on pistachio and coconut...to die for.  All others are very good...different flavour for different palette and mood of the day.  I spoke to Van and Tracy...very nice, super friendly and great service.  No MSG in their cooking.  I can't wait to try their banh mi next time and of course their gelato.  Very nice decor, simple and clean.  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for pho.  Feels like home cooking. No msg. I liked it very much.  Their gelato is also good. Don't know which favour. Try the coconut. You will like it."}
