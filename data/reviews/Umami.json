{"text":"I've been to Umami twice since it opened. My first experience was super wonderful; my partner and I sat at the bar, enjoyed the pork ramen, the hot sake, the music, the interior, everything! On top of that, we received excellent service from our bartender. I dine out in Pittsburgh quite often but, unfortunately, my second experience with Umami was terrible and is the catalyst for this review. I wish I was joking when I say this because it sounds comical, but I can't guarantee that you'll be waited on at Umami if you happen to share a mutual acquaintance with their front of house staff.

I loved Umami so much the first time that I went back one early evening a few weeks ago, only a couple of days after my first visit. We again sat at the bar. It was empty, save for one other patron a few seats down. We were happy to be greeted by the same bartender who took care of us on our previous trip. She took our orders, we enjoyed our meal without incident, and were ready to pay and leave. We noticed then that we hadn't seen our bartender in a bit, possibly because her shift ended or she was on a break - whatever the reason. This would have been a minor inconvenience if there hadn't been another bartender working alongside ours for the entirety of our meal, so we anticipated simply cashing out with her.

We had been finished with our meals for about 10 minutes now. During this time, this second bartender made drinks for the floor when she had to but otherwise walked back and forth in front of us, busying herself with random tasks while we sat there, watched her, and waited. She never makes eye contact, never stops to check on us to see if we need anything, no interaction whatsoever. The bar remains empty with still just one other patron, with whom she IS interacting. We eventually place our cards on the bar in an attempt to somehow get her attention. I said \"excuse me\" once as she shuffled by, but was passed over.  At this point I recognize this bartender, L*nzee, as a friend of one of my ex-partners from several years ago. Admittedly my first instinct, I concluded that it was silly to presume we were not being waited on for that reason. 

Several more minutes go by with absolutely no consideration from her whatsoever. We now suspect she is actively disregarding us. This realization is confirmed when we watch her leave the bar and pull a server from the floor (which from what I could see was busy - almost all of the tables were full). She tells the server to go find our check on the bar's POS system, ring us up, and cash us out. We see and hear all of this happen because we are sitting adjacent to the entire interaction. The server confusingly leaves her section of tables to go behind the bar. She has trouble locating our tab and the bartender has to walk back in front of us to assist the server with finding our check. So now, she is literally at her own POS station directly across from us with the ability to turn around and deliver our tab. Instead, she continues to willfully evade us while remaining behind the bar and keeps this server away from her own tables in order to run our cards. It's totally uncomfortable watching all of this unfold. Thankfully, this server was super friendly. We felt badly for unnecessarily taking up her time to do someone else's job; however, we were more than ready to leave at this point. We paid, tipped 20%, and tried to forget about it.

The most pathetic part of the whole experience is that this bartender later bragged to our server that she did intentionally ignore us to spite me because she is friends with my ex. This admission eventually got back to my dining partner (who also works in the service industry) via the server herself, and eventually to me this afternoon. Are you kidding??! This is absolutely ridiculous, immature, and completely unprofessional. I would never anticipate this kind of behavior from a long-time bartender at a brand new restaurant, barely open a few months, for such petty, unrelated, and ignorant reasons. Pittsburgh is way too small for this kind of senseless dining experience. It goes without saying that this is a business, not middle school. The whole thing soured my initially positive impression of Umami, is flat out embarrassing for the bartender in particular (I can't believe that as an adult she would be proud of herself for this), and most regrettably reflects poorly on Umami's staff as a whole."}
{"text":"Alright - I am NOT a ramen expert.  I have never been to Japan, I have not worked under the best noodle master in Shanghai, I don't think I have had the best, most rare, noodles on the planet.  I only know what I like and what I don't like.  

I liked Umami a lot.  I enjoyed my bowl of ramen, and I wish I loved closer so I could have it more often.  I also really appreciated that I could select additional items to add to my bowl of ramen.  

If you are in the area, and fancy a tasty bowl of ramen, stop by.  It's not rocket science, kids, it's ramen."}
{"text":"New Management / ownership the place has changed I lost my favorite Japanese restaurant :-( now it is all you can eat sushi (mostly rice) and it is really not good."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant!! The food is good. My favorite is the whole fish with a rice bowl. On Saturday they always have a dj, so it's a nice place to go."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. tried the miso grilled chicken and pork versions of their ramen offering.

Taste: its fine. Its ramen, true carbs. So its filling and fine. I personally like the taste of miso and so i like their broth as well. 

Add ons: Here is the rip off. If you order the 8$ bowl, you would get some ramen, spinach and kimchi. You need to add on your protein and flavor for additional cost. The more you pay, more flavor you get.

Price: This is my main gripe. Ramen is the cheap grad student food. Cup o noodle like basics are very pricey here. And my 12$ bowl of ramen is just not worth it.

I eat a lot of asian food: ramen, pho, etc. And i would not recommend this place if you love your asian food as well. 

They have a great marketing team though. They are all over facebook. Kudos to that."}
{"text":"O.K, so heres the thing. These guys got their \"one of the hottest ramen noodle joints in the country yada yada\" nod, before they were even open. Can you say great marketing team? Absolutely, and the place is really nice looking, but it's NOT good. And this is not an \"authentic\" vs not authentic thing as many people have taken one side or the other for. I could care less if it was authentic, as long as it tasted good, which it does not. Flavorless, greasy, over cooked this, under cooked that. The miso broth pork bowl was the biggest travesty of them all. There were 4 of us, and there were so many holes in the execution of the dishes, that it just felt clumsy and...yes, had you wishing for a more seasoned team (which may be why many people are screaming for \"authenticity\" by authentic they may just be saying they want something thats good....or at the very least something worth the price tag...which in this case is a little exorbitant compared to their competition.  Base price of most dishes is already on the border, and then come the add ons. Add Ons which are not add ons in other places that serve ramen. Bad form, they essentially even charge you extra for flavor. Bottom line, authentic, not authentic....I would rather spend my money in a place where the dishes come WITH the flavor included in the price. If you can make it down to Ahwatukee, Sushi Ken's got some stellar ramen. Ramen Republic not too shabby either, I would skip this one though. There are so many places where you'll be paying for a lot less than an awesome marketing team tells you you should pay for this kind of thing, and get a whole lot more."}
{"text":"With all the local accolades and buzz, my party of 4 sat down with a certain level of expectation. Our assessment was that the food was OK, but considering we spent about $190 on the meal, we said, \"meh\". My tuna dish was good, not outstanding, as was the curried chicken and the appetizers--goat cheese dumplings, onion soup, and spring-like roll. The creme brûlée was just so so. The wine offerings were good but not any hidden gems that would make us say wow.

We got the impression this restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be yet--we found their fusion concept to be lacking in taste and execution--and at the price point I'm not going to wait for them to do so."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique, great location, vegetarian options, affordable. What more do you want?

You get to pick the broth you want and they do have a vegetarian broth. Then there are a variety of vegetables, noodles, egg, tofu.. etc. You get to pick the ingredients you want and the spice level. It was hot and flavorful and satisfying.  I will definitely be going back. 

Service was good and owner came over to speak with us - very enthusiastic about the business and upcoming additions to the menu."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to when no one in my family wants to cook. It is just about the only Asian fusion restaurant in the area, and although the menu is limited, pretty much everything on there is great. The specials make good use of whatever ingredients are in season. I love that they have bloom tea because its hard to find elsewhere and they have a pretty good selection. The most important thing to keep in mind is to only bring a small party because the restaurant is so tiny that anything over four people is too squishy."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing prices. Delicious.  Love the simple yet perfect menu. Something for everyone's likes from simple California roll to Japanese Lasagna to Sashimi. Kris was our server and was perfect. Very attentive and the good came very fast."}
{"text":"Umami is lights out.

If Umami wasn't a restaurant, it would be a gazelle. It would roam across the plains of over-sized portions and fried food of Pittsburgh, being itself and being the best at it while we all quietly watched.

This is the best restaurant not named after a starch and a protein in the city. If you don't feel like loading into a mega bus or shelling out the hundred bucks to JFK, Umami is the closest place to NYC in the burgh. I've been three or four times since it has opened, and I have nothing but good things to say. Literally, everything I've had from the chirashi to the robatayaki to the gyoza is unbeatable.

Not to brag, but I was also told by a server that my wife and I were the first to finish a bucket of sake and still order more. That's Umami, though. They'd be the best, they'd go for better, and they'd never settle. Umami would be the fastest, most graceful, beautiful gazelle."}
{"text":"Umami is a must try sushi spot. They're food was amazing and customer service was over the top. My wife and I sat at the bar and the sushi chef was constantly checking if we needed something. My wife also wanted something spicy but she couldn't decide what and the chef suggested the poke salad and said he could make it spicy and it was phenomenal. Definitely a must go to restaurant and we will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"My best friend and I are real ramen jockeys. We have ramen'd from the hillcrests of San Diego to the Valleys of Chino. We. Know. Legit. Ramen. 

We were excited to take advantage of the \"Rainy Day Special\" which takes $8 off your bill when you buy at least 2 bowls of ramen. The idea here is that you're getting a \"free\" bowl of ramen but $8 is the cost of the basic bowl of ramen - you need to pay extra for additional items, many of which are standard in a bowl of solid ramen (i.e., egg and pork). Ok, this is fine. There are several fine ramen joints across our great land that allow you to customize your ramen, such as the splendiferous Shin-Sen-Gumi Ramen of Los Angeles. 

We both got the Paitan broth (most similar to tonkotsu ramen for those in the know). By the time we got to the restaurant at 6:30, they had already run out of chashu pork and a couple other proteins. We ended up going with the roasted pork for our proteins and customized our bowls from there. We placed our orders with a very sweet server and waited....and waited...and waited. 

Our bowls finally arrived and the sweet server kindly explained that the kitchen had run out of roasted pork and subbed shredded chicken instead......record scratch....what? They just subbed in a protein without telling us? To paraphrase Rick James, you can't just sub chicken for pork in a bowl of ramen like it's the thing to do. Neither of us have EVER been to a restaurant where an item is subbed for the ordered item without notifying the guest in advance. It was very Ramen Twilight Zone. 

We flagged down our server and explained that we didn't want shredded chicken ramen and requested a bowl without protein instead. Our server was gracious and we waited....some more. She brought a bowl of \"on the house\" edamame for our hassle which was very kind. We noshed on our edamame and our bowls came out much quicker this time but with much less broth and noodles than before. It was clear that the kitchen was now rationing out smaller portions. Fortunately, the server hadn't taken the chicken ramen so we grabbed our noodles and extra broth to zhush up the newly delivered bowls. 

Taste: LEGIT. The broth and noodles were among the best we've ever tasted here in Phoenix, Itwould have been nice to sample the pork to get a truly authentic experience, but the essence of the soup was damn good. 

Oh, and when we got our check, it looked like we were charged for those \"on the house\" edamame. 

If they can get their act together, we will be back."}
{"text":"Lobster ramen was tasty. Expensive but worth it due to the full lobster tail and seafood in it. Crab leg  was tasty (says the hubby) but I couldn't get over the price for ONE leg ($16). Garlic edemame and Gyoza was good too."}
{"text":"This place is literally 50 feet from where I work. The noodles I ordered were amazing. They were quick to prepare the meal for take out too. You earned a customer, I'll be back for lunch next time! Service was good too, they offered me water while I waited for my food, even as a take out order.
Basic orders cost 8$, add a few toppings and it can easily add up  to 11$"}
{"text":"The best Sushi ever!   I have had Sushi almost everywhere except Japan and this is the best Sushi that I have ever had.  The décor is fabulous, the service is exceptional, the presentation is amazing and the Sushi is heavenly!   

If you like baked rolls you will quickly discover that every baked roll you have ever had in your past was wrong and these baked rolls are just right right right.  If you like Japanese Lasagna order the Vegas roll instead... this is a detour in the right direction!  The Full Moon proves that not every roll has to be heavy to have incredible flavor.  

Have I mentioned the Pink Lady yet???  OMG!  Refreshing, sassy & delicious!!  Garlic Tuna??? ooooohhhhh ya!

Make sure Tracy is your server, order the Jalapeno Bomb appetizer (not too spicy) and be prepared to lick the plate while you wait for the Chef to amaze you!

And the Sake.......  oh mann!!!!!

Umami.... the fifth taste.....   Yes please!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Lawrenceville. I was so intimidated by the menu, but when we got there, our waitress was so unbelievably helpful. She suggested things and encouraged us to take a risk on a lot of dishes. Everything was delicious. Someone in our party was gluten free and the chef made him a special dish- so inviting"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place in phoenix!! The food is consistently delicious and the service is great. They always make us feel welcomed when we come in. I love that you can build your own bowl of ramen and the broth is so flavorful."}
{"text":"Good Japanese Ramen restaurant in a zone where  lacks Asian food. Not easy to find the place. Appetizers are also good."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. I ordered misogyny with tofu and eggs. It came with soinach, scallions, nori  *seaweed, and naruto *fish cake. It was very tasty and the service was fast and friendly. I'll definitely recommend this to  friends."}
{"text":"They used shredded pork instead of sliced pork. I wasn't paying attention since I never ever ever everrr had shredded pork on any ramen I tried both in LA and AZ. 
It is bad bad idea because all the juices soaked in the shredded pork interfere with the flavoring. Whatever spices that they added on the soup wasn't able to penetrate the shredded pork, as result the ramen soup tasted like ramen soup mixed with pure salted pork broth. I know ramen broth is made out of pork but what I'm trying to point out is that it's the mix of pork broth and whatever magical seasonings they added in to that pork broth that make it Ramen Soup. So by adding shredded pork soaked in unseasoned pork broth is like diluting the soup. 
I will come back but I will not order the meat everrr....
I guess this review is dedicated to Taylor Swift Circa 2012"}
{"text":"Let's start from the good to not so good:
Good: nice decor, open kitchen
Not so good: FOOD.

We decided to try this place only because one other yelper thought the ramen here is better than the famous Ippudo place in NY, which I really like. As it turns out, there is no way that the ramen in Umami is anywhere close to Ippudo's. Two important elements of ramen are soup and noodles. The soup is unsavory, and the noodle is undercooked. Nothing is right about the ramen, except for the egg maybe.

We also tried takoyaki (grilled octupus balls). It was okay, better than the ramen."}
{"text":"No words needed for this place. Simply AMAZING. Amazing food, wonderful food and great sake selection. highly recommend this new restaurant in the north area. You won't be disappointed.  five thumbs up"}
{"text":"I've been a few times, and overall the atmosphere has been very chill without too many rowdy ASU students. 

Service in the dining area was a little off-- orders were forgotten--but the place is new enough so I understand. 

The food is delicious, they serve Orion, and have a great selection of sake and are very knowledgeable and eager to let you sample, especially if you sit at the bar.

The owners and staff are all really cool and I love that I can go after midnight on the weekends. I just wish it were a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Cool, relaxed, open atmosphere. Ramen is really good and not that expensive. I got the chicken/pork bone broth, add roasted pork and maybe a hard boiled egg. Cucumber water (served in place of regular water) is a little too chic for my tastes, but whatever that's me. Great place to go as the weather cools down a bit"}
{"text":"Noticed this spot a week ago i am glad i went back. The fish was so fresh and the service was excellent! It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love it! I was visiting my friends down in Phoenix a few weeks ago, and she wanted to take us here. It was amazing!!!! The cracklings that they put on top were to die for. 

The only sad thing was that they were out of garlic when we were there. But even without the garlic the noodles were amazing. 

I'm back in California, and I'm CRAVING the noodles again

I can't wait to go back there again next time I'm in arizona!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much hype about this place finally having a brick and mortar restaurant rather than random pop-ups, I couldn't wait to try it. 

I ordered an array of the skewers including pork belly, chicken hearts, and beef. Pieces of the pork belly were way too fatty to even chew, and the rest of the skewers were just okay. Altogether we ordered a whole red snapper (which was the special), the Japanese fried chicken, the eggplant, the shumai, and both ramen bowls. Overall, everything was pretty tasty. Everything was authentic in taste and the atmosphere was great. I feel something was missing from this place though. I had much higher expectations, but still it was very good."}
{"text":"Super fresh and amazingly delicious! Awesome sushi chefs and great customer service! Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! This place is great! Love the menu creativity and ambiance! The staff is really nice and the food is flavorful and not too salty. Miso base with all the fixin's is the way to go. Blonde german guy there is awesome and super friendly and helpful. Go to Umami!"}
{"text":"The food is prepared al dente, the noodles are meant to have that texture and its meant for the toppings to be cold because you are supposed to let them heat up in the broth when you mix everything around.
Just wanted to clarify. Anyways, the food has always been amazing. Never too salty. The broth is rich and flavorful. I like the paitan with garlic and of course sriracha. Chicken and crackling are good too. Plus there's a bar, can't go wrong with that :) 
It's a really fun place to come and eat/drink/bullshit with your friends. Very chill atmosphere and super cool staff !!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite sushi restaurant! The rolls were really well put together. The Red Bull roll was delicious! Great service too."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and we will be back many times over. First off, such great atmosphere. Very cool carved out floor seating, great bar area, lighting etc.  We had made a reservation for four but when we got there it mistakenly had  been made for the night before. The staff was very gracious, providing us with champagne while we waited for a table.  Once seated we enjoyed amazing service as well as amazing food. Kristen was our server.  You gotta love a server who is knowledgeable and helpful with the menu but also knows how to have fun with her guests. #teamkristen. Chef Roger even accommodated my husband with a custom gluten free entree, also amazing.  The menu here is original, funky and delicious. The staff is kind and well trained. What a great addition to the restaurant scene in Lville. Thanks for a great dining experience.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Killer place for a good ramen!! I'm actually shocked that it wasn't crowded at lunchtime, because this place has amazing food!!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to try this place because I could customize the dish and choose the type of broth. I ordered the sea salt broth and added spam, corn, and an egg. The flavor and quality of the ramen was quite good. It was a little less authentic/ethnic tasting than some I've had but I believe that also makes it more appealing and accessible to mainstream tastes.

Usually I have trouble finishing the large bowls of ramen at restaurants but my guest and I both felt the portions here were smaller than usual. It was $8 for the base and the spam, corn, and egg brought it to about $10. I like that I could customize the dish but I felt I generally got a larger portion with more ingredients at other ramen shops for less money. Two bowls of ramen and two sodas came to $25 plus tip so if you prefer to customize then this place might be for you. But if you like all the ingredients that are usually put in a restaurant's ramen anyway you might get more value there than here."}
{"text":"Great ramen - a bit pricy for what it is but it's trendy now so what can you do? They do have a happy hour and cheaper \"daily special\" bowls if you're feeling frugal. 

The waitress was super friendly and helpful - she answered all of my questions and was comfortable making recommendations. 

I got the miso broth with roasted pork and spicy corn - it had great flavor good heat without setting my mouth on fire. My companion had the paitan broth with chicken, corn, butter, and a soft boiled egg. The broth was super flavorful and the egg was perfectly cooked. 

There is no parking onsite but there is a garage super close by and they validate parking so it's basically the same thing :)"}
{"text":"Ohh Umami, you have ruined me.  I think it was Tom Collichio who said in an interview once (to paraphrase)  \"we don't sell food, we sell happiness.\"  And if something makes the customer happy, do it.  That's how I feel about Umami.  No question the food is excellent, but that's just the start of the \"experience\" at Umami that makes it so special.

Starting from the theater of entering through a nondescript side door, and climbing two narrow flights of steep steps, you are transported to a different environment.  Your menu remains on the table, supporting the \"order as you go\" style encouraged on the first page of the menu.  There's something subtle and wonderful about that.  It makes the usual restaurant feel somehow industrial.  Please complete your order from this list, and I will submit it for manufacture, and have it shipped to your table.  You will then eat and leave. Umami is nothing like this.

The open kitchen is more theater, and the precision of the chefs is great to watch.  Have a sake, and enjoy some fresh barbecued skewers of smoky wonderfulness, order several, they're small and yummy.  Then maybe put in an order of Okonomiyaki (a terrific Japanese savory pancake).  More theater, as the Pancake arrives with shaved bonito flakes sprinkled over the top, which will gently dance in the heat as it rises from the pancake.  Animated, delightful. 

The waitstaff is knowledgable, busy, never rushed, always attentive, never seeming to care if they turn the table (the opposite in fact).  After the pancake, we ordered handrolls, which came with a little pipette of soy which you use to add drips of soy as you eat the savory cone of goodness (that's theater too, I guess, and it's fun and makes the eating better).

And on the night we were there they even had a DJ spinning subterranean grooves and atmosphere, Subtle, and supportive of a place to go to spend time, rather than to just eat a meal. 

Others have been more eloquent about the food, and the food really is excellent, but what makes Umami a true gem is the experience.  Umami serves happiness, and I'm grateful to have them so close by.

 We've been twice, and it was that good both times."}
{"text":"Vegan Ramen! Would like to see a fried tofu option! The base was excellent!  Good service.  Nice people."}
{"text":"Make sure you add meat to your Ramen, otherwise they will accidentally give you the gross vegan broth, lie to you about fixing it, and charge you a mandatory 20% tip because they know they fucked up"}
{"text":"Went there based on the reviews here and we weren't disappointed.  The Number 5, Pink Lady, and Grand Canyon were the rolls we ordered along with yellowtail jalapeño and they were all delish!!! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch yesterday. It was my first time here- I've been wanting to go for a long time. 
I am not a foodie, but I do like to cook and I know a little about food. Basically, I like yummy food that tastes great and I like warm, cozy restaurants. It's that simple. Well, this is a warm cozy restaurant that serves REALLY good yummy food. 
I am allergic to seafood (plus I do not like seafood). There were plenty of options for me. It's a smallish menu (at least for lunch). We got the goat cheese dumpling appetizer, and then my friends and I (a total of 3 of us) each got a large plate entree and shared. We got: Udon noodles with beef, pork belly with ginger, and I can't remember what the other one was called but it had beef in it. I have never tasted such tender meat in my entire life. I am not a huge meat eater but this was irresistible. Portions were great. 
For dessert (traditional desserts on the list) we each got the coffee creme brûlée and all but licked our dishes. 
I don't know about flavor profiles, or food creativity, or anything like that. I'll leave that to the serious foodies and the Chopped judges. But if you want to fill your tummy with delicious food in a pleasant atmosphere, go here! Can't wait to return for dinner."}
{"text":"I will start out this review like many others, walking up to the restaurant is a bit confusing to new comers. Follow the yellow brick road (the narrow black steps) all the way to the tippy top and you enter a small but unique restaurant.
We went on a Thursday evening and were pleasantly surprised they had a DJ playing music but man the place was packed for a Thursday! We had reservations and still waited about 10 minutes for our table to get cleared up. The crowd didn't disperse either throughout our dinner.
 
Our waitress was very nice and went over the menu for us, very helpful! 
They had everything from chicken heart skewers to bowls of ramen and maki. 
I like that the menu says, \"order as you go.\" The plates are smaller and if you are looking to get filled up, you need to order more than one plate. 
We started with the beef tenderloin and chicken heart skewers to share. The waitress was right, you definitely need to order more than one! Each skewer has 3 small pieces on it but they are also prices from $2-$4 so can't expect too much.
Second, we had the pork and shrimp shumai..OH MY.. delicious. The plate came with six pieces, again, maybe good for one person but for two- order more:-) 
Lastly, we both had ramen bowls. I got the miso ramen and if you like miso soup then you must try this! It's literally miso soup with a bit more spice and noodles so the goodness never ends! 
I would definitely recommend checking this place out the vibe and decor is worth seeing , not to mention the food!"}
{"text":"About a year ago my husband and I spent some time in Japan slurping ramen with the locals. Since then we've been looking for a place around Phoenix that offers the authentic ramen experience that we had there. Unfortunately, Umami isn't the place. 

The server was extremely friendly but wasn't well informed of the menu. We ordered the miso ramen and the soy ramen. Both had a very pretty presentation, but were just average in all other respects. As another reviewer mentioned, the broth lacked depth and was very salty toward the bottom of the bowl (perhaps we weren't stirring vigorously enough while we were eating). I also thought the noodles were too firm, perhaps even undercooked, and was hoping that after sitting in the broth for a few minutes they would cook to perfection but that wasn't the case. We were also disappointed with the temperature of the broth, and more importantly, the bowl. In Japan, it was so hot that you practically burned your mouth, and this temperature was largely sustained throughout the meal because the bowls were stoneware, and probably pre-heated. At Umami, the broth was reasonably hot at first, but tepid after a few minutes because the bowls are thin.

The chef walked around the dining room talking to customers and he certainly cares about his guests and is enthusiastic about ramen. We are hoping that with time he is able to hone his craft and come closer to perfection. In a pinch we'd probably go back, but it's not something that we'd go out of our way to recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Sunday around 2pm, only 2 other guests. EMPTY
Ordered Chasu Ramen tasted bland-not that great.
Vegetable Tempura: fresh but over coated, it was thick and the brocolli one was huge, hard to eat.
Beer:$9 over priced, cute but not worth it.
One waitress and bus girl.
I was so excited to come here but it was disappointing. Wasted $35"}
{"text":"The word Umami is a big deal in Japan, it represents a  feeling you get from the food you taste...like when you try something so delicious your eyes roll back, your head tilts to the side, you give a gentle mmmmmm sound, and you savor the flavors that literally melt in your mouth!!!!

So when you come to a restaurant named UMAMI, your expectations are very high!  Came here for dinner about a week ago, and the location was rather odd.  Tucked into the alley almost off the main street, but the decor was pretty modern inside.  All of  us tried a different broth base and the four appetizers for $8 deal.  

I really liked the style and function of the menus.  You check off the list what you want to go in your Ramen and put your name at the top!  

So starting with the apps I had squid salad, a small tofu roll, kimchi, and a tiny pork bowl with rice.  3 of the items were ok at  best, but the tofu roll had no flavor at all and the seaweed wrap was really tough to break through!  

The Ramen arrived and looked amazing! I mixed pork belly with nori, garlic paste, and a soft egg (the egg for me is a must have in any Ramen bowl).   The egg was perfect yold oozing from the inside, however my wifes egg yolk was over cooked and she ordered the soft.  The broth (pork and chicken) was the absolute star here, but the fresh spinach (which i would normally like but should have actually been cooked to make it soft) really took away from the broth.  I got the crunch and bitterness from the leaves and it honestly made the whole experience, well...not so Umami.  

Overall it was not bad, but not great...so can't say it was UMAMI for me, but the broth was good, it just needs a better supporting cast!"}
{"text":"Ordered ramen with spam, which looked like it came straight out of the can.  When I asked them to pan fry the spam, I was told they do not have pans to sear meat because they use an induction cooker (as compared to an induction stovetop).  This tells me that likely all of their meats, including anything roasted, comes to them precooked in a bag or is boiled.  Sadly, the broth for all of our soups (3 total) was extremely salty.  Husband ordered cracklings, which started good but ended up getting soggy from the soup and became mushy chicken skin.  Staff was nice.  Food was not."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and tried the top rated sushi joint near us. Tempura tasted like it has been sitting out for hours. Batter was more chewy than crunchy. Soda by the can. Fish didn't really pop out to me as fresh or cold. All in all this place was just ok. I will be looking around for other sushi options. Service was good."}
{"text":"The lamb chops and grouper specials were delicious, creative. Portions were very adequate. Exhortatory note: there is a lot of obesity in this country and portion size is a major factor. The chef attempts to use local fresh produce from the area and the green salads were great! And the vegan onion soup was amazing. Very attentive service.   Noisy and very busy during this Saturday summer evening.Very clean well maintained restroom. Keep in mind that this is a small venue with tables so close so as not to be conducive to intimate conversations. We expect to be back soon."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to finally have an izakaya in Pittsburgh. Overall, Umami did not disappoint. Not the most traditional, but definitely fresh and tasty.

The good:
RAZOR CLAMS (special) - Perfectly cooked clams in a savory sauce with garlic, pepper and chinese fermented black beans. Loved it except for the occasional sand in the clams. 
SCALLOP (special) - Jumbo scallop served 2 ways, grilled and sashimi. The grilled one had the perfect amount of smokiness that went so well with the ponzu sauce. The thinly sliced sashimi had a slightly softer texture than expected, but tasted fresh and went very well with the dallop of serrano pepper sauce (caution, very hot!) and the seaweed and shaved beets accompaniments.
PORK BELLY, BACON QUAIL EGG, SHIITAKE MUSHROOM - Pretty tasty, no complains (maybe except for the price).
SALMON AND IKURA HANDROLL, HIRAME NIGIRI - Fish was fresh and sushi rice was well done. There was some crunchy rice seasoning at the bottom of the handroll which I was not a fan of. In retrospect, for the price of one handroll and one nigiri, I should probably go for the chirashi instead. 
PORK & SHRIMP SHUMAI - Not sure that I could taste the shrimp, but it was porky and moist.

Not so good: 
SHRIMP - Did not want to order this but the bf insisted. Shrimp tends to be a disappointment unless it is a live spot prawn. As expect, this was meh.  
TONKOTSU RAMEN - This was the biggest disappointment of the night. Instead of the rich, milky and meaty broth that we love about tonkotsu ramen, we received a sweet, shoyu-type broth instead. The noodles and char siu were nothing to write home about either. Would not order again.

Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal, with delicious food, attentive service and decent drinks. Pricey, yes, but that seems to be a common problem with the exploding food scene in Pittsburgh. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Super friendly place! Really enjoyed eating here. The food was great and the service was good.  The place was nice and clean with awesome music being played. It was a bit tricky trying to find this place but once I found it, I felt like an idiot because I literally parked right next to it. I'll definitely be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better ramen places in the valley that I have tried so far. It's unfair to compare to the best ramen I have had in San Jose so as far as Phoenix goes this would be my go to.

I'll keep it short since there's nothing too spectacular. They have a nice concept where you can build your own ramen and choose the broth and ingredients. I ordered a vegetarian inspired ramen. The broth was pretty salty but the soft boiled egg was really  good. The staff is not top notch and could use some more charm. I'd still recommend umami if you're in the Tempe region looking for a bowl of ramen. They have good options and you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's very small do be sure to book ahead, it's worth it. Fantastic food and excellent service every time we go. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Centennial Hills has been a gastronomical wasteland forever.. That's beginning to change and UMAMI has alot to do with that. This is a relatively new place. It is terrific. Great food, varied menu, friendly and helpful staff.Neat place and ambience.For me it's only five minutes from my house, however worth a trip from other parts of town. Never knew that there was Japanese sausage. Well there is. And this appetizer was so good, that I ordered some to take home.A total winner."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and decor.  Every single dish we ordered was great!  Had the yellowtail hamachi, agedashi tofu, salmon skin hand roll, tempura udon, and short ribs.   Give this place a try!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place had been talked up to us by numerous people so we were really excited to try it.
Cocktails- good, unique twists, but nothing mind-blowingly delicious. It seemed like a lot of it was in the accents (pop rocks, a matcha stick, etc.) that was fun but didn't ultimately make the drink.
We started with the wagyu beef (overdone, not very flavorful, kind of chewy), the eggplant (cooked fine but again, not very flavorful) and the unagi sashimi (excellent) plus their special of the night, fried oysters (also excellent- lightly breaded, still nice inside).
Next we shared the miso deviled eggs (my cousin and I loved them, my husband wasn't a fan), the nasu shigiyaki (tasty but also extremely salty and difficult to figure out initially - it kind of crumbled when we tried to cut it up to share) plus the pork and shrimp shumai (tasty but nothing mind blowing).
We finished with a bowl of the Yaki udon which was my favorite item of the night. It was salty, savory, the egg was perfectly cooked and it was just such a warming, filling dish.
I would go back for a bowl of the udon or get takeout, but I don't think this is a place we would go back to for a full meal like we did. Despite taking our server's recommendations we were disappointed by most of it. Good, but not exceedingly so."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and vibe. Servers were friendly and prompt. We had edamame, two pieces of sashimi, the udon, and the ramen, finished the the fried ice cream. I also had one of their cocktails. Everything was excellent. Would definitely go back, would be a great place to bring out of town guests to show them the foodie/hipster side of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It used to be my favorite ramen place, but now they only serve sushi and it's my new favorite sushi place. The sushi is super fresh and they serve generous portions of quality fish. The service is great too. There's a nice special they have of $1 large sake with all you can eat sushi. I've been here several times and I've always left very happy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorites. Very nice upscale atmosphere and the service was superb. The staff is very attentive and pleasant.  The sushi is the best that i've had here in Vegas. Great place to come for a date night or ladies night or family night as well. The ambiance is very romantic and chic!"}
{"text":"Sushi cravings are inconvenient in Pittsburgh. I wanted a hand roll. So that limited my options. I decided to give Umami a try because I was truly in need of raw fish. 

AMBIENCE B-
Yikes. I kept looking around to see if anyone looked liked they belonged in that strange atmosphere, and I can't say anyone did. We went on a weeknight without a reservation and were seated at the bar. I had a prime view of a glass display case of precut fish. The place had neon lights and an indoor grill that accommodated the few hot food items. The only other time I've been so bombarded by an Asian neon stereotype is when Hot for Chicken was open in Ktown. But that place billed itself as a hangout. This place was not that.

SERVICE A-
It was fine, the guy was nice enough but considering we were ordering small plates as we ate, he didn't come around quite enough and so dinner lasted forever.

DRINKS A-
I ordered the ginger ginger which was fine. Tasty and not too sweet. But it was tiny.

APPETIZER A-
I insisted on getting appetizers so we didn't have to declare bankruptcy from our sushi needs. So we got the takoyaki, which again, was fine. Are you starting to see a theme?

MAIN COURSE A-
There were multiple rounds of nigiri and a salmon hand roll, which set us back enough that I threatened to fly to LA next time I wanted sushi. The fish was fresh enough and a decent quality. The hand roll was as expected. Everything was...Fine.

DESSERT
I cannot for the life of me remember if I had dessert. 

So in conclusion, this satisfied my sushi cravings for a total of 48 hours, after which I found myself needing it again. Was it worth it? Maybe?"}
{"text":"Love this place.. if you appreciate good sashimi and nigiri you will see what I'm talking about ! They take pride In what they do and it shows :)!"}
{"text":"After living in East Asia for over 6 years, Umami is one of the best places in Phoenix for an excellent bowl of ramen. I highly recommend the Paitan broth for it's rich flavor.

Chefs are passionate about the food they make and the staff in general are very friendly and knowledgeable.

Also, great selection of Asian beers, sake and tea."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best (if not the best) ramen in Phoenix. Classic Japanese ramen with a touch of the chef's fresh local ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. The decor is interesting and makes for a fun ambiance. Best cocktail I have had in a long time. The egg custard was truly special. Will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly upon entering. Once seated our server came to get our drink order. Every time we wanted to order more food our server came at the most appropriate times, knowing when we would like something. Someone separate came to grab empty plates from your table swiftly and refilled our drinks. The atmosphere is wonderful and it feels both intimate and serene. I will definitely be recommending to friends and family."}
{"text":"Umami just opened in Pittsburgh four days ago! I was so excited to finally get a reservation and try their offerings. I would definitely ensure that you book a res for this restaurant. You have to walk up two flights of stairs and on your way up, you will see beautiful lanterns and wallpaper with red lighting. The bar are is small as is the restaurant itself. Once you reach the top of the stairs, to the left is traditional floor seating and to the right is the bar and seating at tables. All tables are very close together so be prepared to stare at your neighbors or have them stare at you. The table seating really should be in a better layout as the servers have to navigate in very tight quarters between bar seating and table seating and among guests just standing around. I felt bad for the staff as I'm sure this is frustrating. The sake selection varies and we ended up getting a 300 ml bottle for $30. It was alright, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend ordered the Lion Wolf and Cub. Wow, this was delicious! It's a kirin draft and a falling petal shot which is draft sake shot infused with hibiscus! I could have drank these all night. Now onto the food. The pork and shrimp shumai had a great flavor and I love the added edamame on top. The takoyaki was hands down the best dish we had! I could have just ordered those for the rest of the night and been happy! Knowing that they just opened, I'll come back but will have to give it some time to allow them to work on a few things. Overall, another nice hip place to go to when you find yourself in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Love this place. The paitan is always amazing, drinks are super tasty, great selections of sake and beers, atmosphere is nice, servers are super friendly, always great food! Best ramen in tempe!"}
{"text":"This place was in a weird location to find. However it's a small place. I did order the miso ramen soup with chicken. The presentation did look nice. I would like that they provide more seaweed than just a square of if. The soup at first did taste good, although after a while it did start tasting a little salty. The ramen wasn't fully cooked through if it was cooked just a few minutes more it would taste much better."}
{"text":"The ramen is good but the service needs help.  We waited over 20 minutes for menus.  Our orders came out wrong, and there were extra charges on our checks that we didn't have time to dispute after being there for over an hour already."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and I was blown away with how good everything was and how great the customer service was. It's a really good sushi spot to go to if you're in the north side. Our server Nina was amazing! She recommended the peach sake.. it's def a must try!"}
{"text":"This place changed my life! I've seriously never had better ramen. The spicy miso with porkbelly was amazeballs, and don't forget the squid salad! I am so sad to see this restaurant's doors close, but am hoping to see a relocation very soon!"}
{"text":"Morning Yall...I visited this spot on last night and it was delicious. I would have given then 5 stars, but I the meats of the 3 were coolish to cold...Pork...Chicken with is shredded, and bacon/cracklings once wet it's bacon. Everything else was super nice...oh yeah i strongly dislike seafood and I forgot to tell them no seaweed, but the cute way that it is applied it was easily removed..BUT THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS WILL I  BE BACK....YES!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first ramen restaurant that I have visited. 

ATMOSPHERE - I like the ambiance of this place; it's cool, hip, and very calming. Their deco is pretty awesome. A few people have told me that their bathroom is pretty swanky. I like the general area of this restaurant. The lofts look nice from the outside and definitely so from the inside. It's never too crowded or too empty, which is nice. 

MENU - They have happy hour. Their foods are fairly-priced (around $8/bowl which is average) for the quality they offer. I love the choices they give you of noodles and broths and things you can put into your bowl. I've always ordered an extra bowl of noodles, though. 

SERVICE - I've only seen about two people working at any given time as servers, but that by no means is understaffed. Their service is prompt and not overwhelming like some other restaurants' can be. 

People kept telling me that it is better than Republic Ramen. Will update when I visit RR."}
{"text":"I adore Umami. It is one of the few restaurants in Pittsburgh that I think is really a treasure. Prices are fair, and the food is all so, so good. Best sushi in Pittsburgh, delicious little grilled kebabs (the bacon and quail egg is one of the most perfect bites I've ever had), and unique and interesting Japanese snacks."}
{"text":"Visited Umami today on recommendation of other Yelp reviewers, and so glad we did. When vacationing in Maui, one of our favorite delicacies is Yellowtail Kama. Until today, we haven't found any as good. Umami's is better!  The rolls we had (California roll with masago; spicy tuna) were rich in flavor. We can't wait to return and tour the rest of the menu..."}
{"text":"May not be as authentic as some old schoolers would like but the food is very good and is a fusion of traditional style and good old slurping ramen   Would recommend you try this place when you wanna bowl of goodness"}
{"text":"I took my adopted daughter in law there for her bday June 20th for lunch. . It was fabulous! Caleb our waiter was very professional and he kept coming back to our table and asking us if we needed anything else? Not overbearing! My daughter in law wanted sushi and they did not disappoint. Price was good and we had leftovers! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Umami for a while, but we have a 1 year old, so getting out for dinner can be a bit of a challenge.  

From reading the other reviews, it seems that service and quality can be spotty at times, however when we went on a Tuesday evening, both were really top notch.  We did have to wait for about 15 minutes for a table, but that was only because there were 7 of us and with the arrangement of tables there was only one place they could put us.  Our server though gave us some edamame and snack mix since we had to wait.  

All of us ordered the Paitan broth based on my recommendation (from reading other yelp reviews) and I am glad we did.  Is it salty?  Sure, but it has amazing flavor - maybe it isn't for everyone?  All I can state is that it was a first for all of us that night, and we all loved it.  

In my bowl I added the charsu pork as well as the roasted pork and the soft egg.  I can honestly state this was the best bowl of \"soup\" that I've ever had.  Also the most expensive at almost $13, but it was so, so worth it.  The ramen noodles had great bite (they weren't overcooked) and the only thing I could have done without would be the garnish of spinach.  

Service throughout the meal was very good - drinks were refilled in a timely fashion, etc.  I also enjoyed the house Nigori (cold, cloudy, & sweet sake basically)  for $3 which doesn't show up on their menu online.  

As with most reviews, you can take mine with a grain of salt, because what I like may not be what you like, but I had high hopes for our first visit, and frankly they were exceeded by the quality of what we ate that night."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ramen! Kept a rowdy group of 14 guys silent for a whole meal. This is the real deal. Everything is prepared for hours and hours and you can practically taste the effort that goes into it. 

Not to mention the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable. This is my favorite place in Tempe and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Umami has a friendly staff! I ordered the Hungry something with extra noodles. Kinda salty, but filling. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Mike the waiter made our evening perfect.  His description of the tuna tartare trio for an appetizer was Oscar-worthy (and yes, we were won over by it!).  Fun cocktail list, hip vibe (read: dark).  Some day I hope to be seated in one of the window seats - very Brooklyn!  

Our dining friends suggested the chicken curry over black rice; all four of us ordered it, so glowing was their description, and it was a wow. We even brought part of wow home and enjoyed it the next day.

Salade?  Too full!  But not for your creme brulee, Umami ..."}
{"text":"You'll be hard pressed to find better ramen anywhere else in Phoenix. The venue is bigger than their last place and they've joined with a pizza/music joint. Great place to stop in by yourself for a quick lunch also."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, your  taste buds will be very pleased. The savory dishes, the delicious fresh fish, the comforting warm ramen bowls, and melt in your mouth desserts. The atmosphere and staff are both wonderful and very friendly. I have gone three times, before writing my review...in order to try a variety of items.  I have been able to dine in very high end restaurants and the dishes prepared here are equally well done."}
{"text":"Great ramen, atmosphere and service... Saw two flies inside the restaurant though, which makes me a little concerned."}
{"text":"Perfect. If you have any problem with how the food tastes you either don't like ramen - and therefore your bloodline is weak - or you added too much crap. The service doesn't matter, the drinks are irrelevant. Just eat the ramen! I recommend the Shoyu ramen with nothing additional."}
{"text":"One of the most creative, delicious and exciting dining experiences I've ever had. My meal at Umami remains to be one favorite dinners. Period. Thanks for putting Pittsburgh on map. Please ship some Okonomiyaki to DC :D"}
{"text":"Crazy good service. I am not a ramen expert so I don't know where it ranks... But it's clean with amazing service... Beer is cold... And food is good. We will be back. 

It's back open too FYI"}
{"text":"UPDATE December 2017:
This sushi place used to be our go to place (see previous 5 star review below). However, it was recently (around October 2017) taken over by new management. The prices are more afordable and you can expect to receive slightly more meat per order. However, the two things that really set the old Umami apart for me was the quality of the fish (and other food) and great service. Both have gone down noticably under new management (therefore the new 2 star review). For this reason I will be finding a new sushi place to frequent.

OLD REVIEW February 2017: If you are looking for a sushi place in the Centennial Hills area this is the place to go, without question. This place takes the spot as one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas. Every fish that we tasted was incredibly FRESH including the salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and the snapper. Both times that we went here we chose to sit at the sushi bar. Where we enjoyed our very quick one on one service from sushi chef Kim. Kim made various recommendations and came off as very knowledgeable. After our main meal; we chose to try the mochi and macaroons which were great as well! Each of the two times we've been here it was a great date experience in a restaurant with a great atmosphere. You won't find an all you can eat option here, but the food is well priced and after you have tasted the quality of their fish you will understand why they are not giving it away through all you can eat specials."}
{"text":"I was very disappointing, they changed the menu a month ago and the quality of the food was terrible.
They went to all you can eat and I believe they are in trouble.  I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Exceeded all expectations. Even though it was crowded the staff was kind enough to look for and find places for me and my companion to sit. The warm sake was quite nice. I got the ground chicken over eggplant (can't remember the dish name) and I can honestly say that the chicken was the best I've ever had. The pear tart at the end of the meal was also exceedingly well made. I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Ramen places around the area and by far this place makes me want to down all the noodles and slurp up all the juice...great people running the spot!"}
{"text":"Went again tonight. This place is great. Great service, not overbearing, not aloof, good drinks, not crazy, no mixologist jerkoffs just really honest drinks. Sake, sochu is great as well. Selection of ramen is really good Paitan was really great, Tan Tan Man is pretty awesome. Again people on here giving anything less than four stars, I have to call you out. Ive had the best in the US, from Momofuku, to Oiister, to Tatsuya, to Yamadaya, to Slurping turtle and this shop good. Owner is always there and is super cool and knows what he is about, what he can do, and he serves people. Talk to him about food and ask him about his ramen. Enjoy the experience and honestly just get plastered, bring a big group of friends, enjoy the noodle and try and have a good time."}
{"text":"After trying Ramen in Los Angeles' \"Little Tokyo,\" which was AMAZING, Umami did not impress me much.

But being in Arizona, thats about the best you're going to get.  Their menu is very simple and they offer a good amount of ingredients to add to your ramen.  

The location is a bit hidden, unless you know the area you might struggle to find it."}
{"text":"Made reservations not sure how useful that was since there was an open table where we could have been seated but the hostess wouldn't seat us there. Apparently those tables were reserved for 4 people therefore a party of 2 can't sit there, even though there was a party of 2 sitting as we waited well past our reservation time and a group with a reservation after he came and were seated before us. While we were there eating, plenty of others were sat at these reserved for 4 tables so that was rather annoying. It is a very small restaurant so even with a reservation, you likely will end up waiting for a table. Food was ok, sushi was subpar, nothing to go home raving about. We may give it another try at some point, hoping that this was just an off night but this place is definitely not known for its sushi!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've ever been to for ramen.
1. the ramen was severely under cooked
2. there was zero customer service, all the staff was too busy talking to their friends or on their cellphones... 
3. One of the employees was licking her finger nails... and playing with nail polish.
are you kidding me? is this a nail salon?"}
{"text":"ordered sashimi, goat cheese dumplings, halibut (special) and rice sticks (special).  food rivals all the top restaurants in cleveland.  the halibut was prepared top notch and flavors were unique and well done.  even the sauces for the sashimi were unique and amazing.  not sure what other people are talking about - this restaurant is great"}
{"text":"I have eagerly been awaiting a visit to Umami since an amazing trip to Tokyo last year.  The restaurant did not disappoint. The special whole grilled Snapper was evocative of the whole fish we enjoyed at an Izakaya in Yurakucho. The only (small) letdown was that the Takoyaki seemed to have minced octopus and not big, delicious cut pieces. Otherwise, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"The ramen here is so delicious. We love getting to pick what we want and it always comes out juuuust how we want it. :) we'll always come back here for ramen.
Drink menu is also great some classics plus tea and beer. Even have some soju kn the menu! Gotta come back ankther time for that."}
{"text":"Very flavorful vegan ramen, much better than Ramen Bar's. The fact that they have fresh made real wasabi is fantastic. The tableside tofu was a nifty little demonstration, and the flavor was much better than your average tofu."}
{"text":"Nice sushi bar. Good food and good ambience. Friendly people. Reasonable price. Make sure you call in for reservation. We were there on. Saturday without reservation so got a seat at the sushi bar which was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Brand new just enjoyed a great meal at their soft opening!  Really flavorful poke and the sauces make the meal - will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good food and good service. My girl and I both had the Miso base with different fixings and we both enjoyed our meal. We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. Place is a little bit dark. Otherwise not a bad spot. It's a typical sushi place, nothing extremely special."}
{"text":"Service is awesome here. There's always a friendly face and they constantly come around to check on how you're doing. Last time I went, the chef even came out to ask my opinion on the dessert. I also love the decor here, modern, clean and hip!

I have gone twice and ordered Paitan broth which was scrumptious. I have friends who hate broth and still drank it all because it was so flavorful. Remember to add cracklings to your soup; it adds a nice crunch! I got the pork belly as well and just wished it had a little more fat to it. 

I love this place but I do think the price can get a bit steep. The basic bowl of noodles is $8 but each additional topping is extra. With such an extensive list of extras, it's hard not to end up with a $11+ bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"I have to say...for an asian who is pretty skeptical about eating at Japanese food restaurants where the workers and chefs are not Japanese, I was pretty impressed. I have been here twice and was satisfied with my ramen bowl.  I had the Paitan ramen (pork/chicken broth) bowl.  The broth is very tasty; I can tell that there was time well spent into making a good broth.  

They also have a good selection of different broths, meat, and additions (ie: hard egg, seaweed, etc.).

I will be coming back again for my next Ramen fix."}
{"text":"Completely blew my expectations! I drove 45 mins from Henderson to try this place and it was worth the drive!

ATMOSPHERE: The decor of this place was actually really nice. They have large TVs which would be fun on game nights. The waiter was a little quiet, but she was really nice. I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar because the sushi chef were very interactive and nice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS RESTAURANT!

FOOD: The pricing of the food was absolutely perfect for this sushi restaurant, I hope that never changes. They offer different combos that are delicious, filling, and easy on your wallet. The Unagi Don is a large bowl of rice with fresh water eel and eel sauce, it comes with miso soup and a choice of cucumber salad or green salad. The Unagi Don was absolutely delicious, my favorite restaurant that makes it in Vegas. Their Sushi & Sashimi Combo comes with chef selected nigiri and sashimi, in addition you get to choose between a California Roll, Spicy Tuna9 Roll, Salmon and Avocado Roll, or Vegetable Roll. You can also order sushi individually here. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) Nigiri is not only beautiful, but made to perfection. They have a smaller specialty rolls menu, but they all look amazing.

DESSERT: They have a more unique dessert menu compared to other restaurants. For cakes, they have a delicious Champagne Cake or a Cheesecake. I was surprised that they have Macarons here in various flavors such as chocolate, passion fruit, and pistachio. As a Japanese restaurant, it's only fitting that they have Mochi Ice Cream in most flavors. Additionally, they have Affogato which is vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso.

DRINK: They have a full sake menu. Their hot tea comes in a cute teapot. They have the basic fountain drinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant failed me in so many ways
1. Got ignored by the host lady. She kept sitting, played with her hair while it's so obvious that I was standing in front of her
2. The waitress was not polite, she gave me a something far away from what is called good service
3. Another waiter took away my plate when there was still sashimi left. I had not finished it yet, did you not see???
4. The taste of the food is just ordinary or even lower. Sashimi was not so fresh, ramen came with all-stick-together-in-chunk noodle. They did not know how to prepare grilled fish, it was way too juicy, Japanese does not cook grilled fish this way!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl with corn and pork. Cost more than 10 bucks.
The food was pricey and you can tell the pork was reheated from fridge.
My home made ramen tastes better than this...
Sorry to give two stars. Really need some improvements."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Sunday. Hamachi kama was really good. Other items are reasonably fine. Good price."}
{"text":"First visit.  Definitely worth coming back.  Great dining atmosphere. Dining room has awesome Samurai mural.  Must try their yummy Dancing Eel roll and OMG 3 roll. Can't wait to try other menu items. Staff attentive. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in around 2p.m. On a Monday for late lunch/early dinner.  Only one other set of customers in business.  This was our first visit here.  We were greeted promptly by one of the waitstaff.  We opted to sit at the sushi bar.

We ordered tako wasabi and screaming O appetizers.  The tako wasabi was a very good sized portion of blissful fresh octopus marinated in wasabi and a little chilli.  Very tasty.  The screaming O didn't get made until we had a couple other rolls.  While the tuna was fresh and tasty, the sauce was like watery soup.  

We also had a Carson roll, a No Name roll, Number 5 roll and a Red Bull.  All the rolls were very nicely made and generally very tasty except for the No Name Roll.  That particular roll was so mild tasting I really did not know what I was eating.  Also the No Name is made like Futumaki, five large pieces.

Service was top notch.  Everyone checked on us numerous times and the chef was friendly and fast.

Would definitely go back.  We decided next time to try the ramen."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a great sushi experience in the north part of vegas. We found it in Umami. To my surprise, they are linked to Sakana and Neko, which were both good choices for ayce sushi. We did go during the ending of their lunch menu and it was't crowded at all. I am sure the foot traffic picks up during dinner as well. We got a booth and it was very spacious and comfortable.

The one major standout here was the service. Excellent customer service sets Umami far apart from establishments like Goemon who have gone downhill due to their lack of service. Our waters were filled often, orders were taken and brought to us in a timely manner, our table and plates were cleaned so often that i felt bad for making them have to stop by our table so often.

The fish was fresh on every different nigiri order as well as their rolls and appetizers. Our server even brought my 5 year old a chopstick holder so she could use her chopsticks instead of a fork. 

I can't say enough great things about this place and i guarantee it will be our go to AYCE sushi from now on."}
{"text":"They supposedly have vegan items on the menu, but they will try their hardest to mess up your order every time. The noodles aren't vegan. They'll say some of the add ons are vegan sometimes and other times not. They'll then add on things you didn't ask for that aren't vegan. For $15 I can get a lot better vegan food on Mill, such as at Desert Roots Kitchen (all vegan), Casa (vegan menu and chef), Chipotle, etc."}
{"text":"Umami has really great food when coming to Japanese cuisine.The monster fries are really good and their excellent corn cheese."}
{"text":"Went on an off day - and it was still pretty packed. Ordered rather quickly then it all went down hill from there.  Received the appetizer quickly then waited over 30 min for our ramen. They were out Pork Belly at 11:15 am and as the server announced they had a rather busy midnight crowd.. Mind you they open at 11:00am. After noticing people who arrived after us had eaten and were leaving I inquired why my order was taking so long. The manager mentioned they were waiting for me to finish my appetizer which was edamame and seaweed salad. Funny - we had finished that in 10 minutes. FINALLY our ramen came and although it was very tasty - it wasn't tasty enough to wipe away the fact that they were out of 3 of their meats and soup took 42 minutes to arrive. Would I return - I think now.."}
{"text":"Good place to eat!  Try Kiss of fire!   Good selection of noodles too.  Service is good....I had AJ as my server and she was fun and helped me pick out good rolls since I'm all about having good sushi.   Sushi was fresh for all you can eat sushi.  Rice didn't fall apart on my nigiri sushi.   Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We thought we'd give Umami a try after seeing the reviews here and this place is great! Fish is high quality and portions very generous! I've recommended to some friends since and they've agreed. We will definitely be back!

Be sure to try 'The Shit' and 'Pang' from the appetizer list; first time I've had anything like that. The salmonholic roll was a hit as well!"}
{"text":"Good Japanese fusion. Nice atmosphere. The ramen noodle is pretty good but the sashimi and skews are ok."}
{"text":"An absolute must!

Everything is fresh, made to order, and DELICIOUS! Each day brings unique specials, along with the standard small and large plates. The chef sources local produce and meats as much as possible. I've never known of a disappointed customer, and I've been there plenty!

There is limited seating, and weekend evenings often require reservations. The comments I see about waits for food, well I haven't found that to be true myself.

When you visit Chagrin Falls, be sure to include lunch or dinner at Umami!"}
{"text":"Amazing for a late night snack. All the specials are amazing. I love the takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Robatayaki are pretty small, and somewhat disappointing compared to the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this restaurant. The staff was very nice and accommodating. I had the Spicy Miso Ramen. It was delicious! It wasn't too spicy. It came with a choice of house salad or cumcunber salad. I got the cucumber salad. Very refreshing. It also came with a roll of sushi. I got the spicy tuna roll. For dessert I had the macaroons. Everything tasted great. I definitely recommend this restaurant for you to check out!"}
{"text":"Deceptively located in lower Lawrenceville, this cozy but trendy little set up on the 3rd floor of the building it is located in is a gem.  Happy hour had some nicely priced options for drinks and small bites.  We had the Yuzu daiquiri and a shot of sake with lychee vodka.  For small plates we had the fried chicken skin which was like crack and I could eat lots of and we also had the deviled eggs which had nice flavor and an extra crispy piece of nori on it which was a nice touch.  I had a chirashi rice bowl which had. A nice variety of fish and topped with some caviar and quail egg yolk.  Presentation was nice.  Overall I enjoyed everything I consumed and would return."}
{"text":"America knows ramen as instant noodles that can be boiled in less than 5 minutes, served with a packet of broth powder. At Umami, the ramen is claimed to be done the \"right way.\" 

Almost the right way. Almost.

It wasn't busy when I came in. It certainly didn't look like they were short on staff either. But not 10 minutes after I ordered, the ramen was already set on the table. The broth was perfect. In fact, every side, garnish, thing, etc. in the dish was perfect. However, the noodles were undercooked, starchy, and tasted like wet dough/instant noodles. PLEASE, next time, even if it's not busy, take at least an extra minute or two to make sure the food is cooked fully. I felt a little queasy after eating half the noodles.

On the plus side, the atmosphere was pushing on trendy: good music, indie/hiphop/colorful decor, on the bottom floor of a loft, pretty cool wait staff. I get it, you want to cater to the cool kids, particularly ASU students and affluent people between the ages of 20-35. However, restaurants are usually and still about the food. 

I will try this place again at a different time on a different day. And then give it a third try and make a final decision on this place."}
{"text":"There's a few negative reviews but I live so close I needed my sushi fix, and I'm a foodie.

I know it's hard to be competitive up by where I live and yes some sushi was just okay, but they have a variety of rolls and I just asked the chef to recommend something.

He made me a \"Dont Cry Amigo\" Spicy Hamachi roll and it was just fine and tasty with a kick!

The tempura was nice and light I had two orders... why not it's all you can eat.

For being close to home and the price this place is fine.. but if you're in a super picky foodie night maybe pass.

You know what else helps, they were super nice and gave me good service and that goes a long way too.


Update! I'm totally sick now... :("}
{"text":"Food was great- but the service...guys:  get it together!  you almost have a home-run, but the lack of training and skill set is KILLING your customer base."}
{"text":"Super good! Interior personal and great food!!! Thank you guys



We will come again 110%"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for?!! Friendly, clean, fresh, great flavors!!  Tonight we ordered 3 rolls (Full Moon, Number 5, and Pink Lady) and after were treated to 2 blue fin belly sashimi, enhanced with caviar and gold flakes. To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Fast, attentive service, it was a pleasure having Elias as our server. Good recommendations, but as a bit of a Japanese food snob I wasn't impressed with what their hot kitchen had to offer, but that quickly changed when we ordered from the sushi area. Rice balls and hand rolls AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place.  Tasty food, fair prices, late hours.

One or two people can almost always find a seat at the bar, although reservations for dinner are hard to get.  The food is really fresh and tasty, whether you're having grilled meats, sushi, or noodle dishes.  

For me, this is a place I like to go after a long night for a beer and some noodles.  I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great concept and great food! After spending time in Japan and eating a lot of ramen, this ranks up there in comparison. The passion and dedication of the owner chef comes through with amazing and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The flavors developed at this restaurant are right on the mark.  Good quality sashimi along with many other creative Asian dishes.  Rahman dishes are over the top good. 
Wait staff knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.
This is a must try if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We have eaten here probably about 7 times...there are so many great rolls to choose from, even if you arent into raw fish. They have deep fried and cooked rolls. They also have noodle dishes and bento boxes for members of your family that do not like sushi. This place made me like sushi. The staff is always friendly. We always get the all you can eat....and walk away stuffed!"}
{"text":"I just fell in love (in several ways).

Great decor, clean bathrooms (which is always a plus), nice bar setting, amazing service (usually pretty waitresses are bad servers but this was a very pleasant exception).

The food was tasteful, filling, inexpensive, what else can you ask for?

I read a couple of bad reviews of people bitching about \"authentic ramen\" or the place being expensive. Don't listen to them. I mean, idk what's authentic nowadays, but what really matters is a good taste, and this place has it!

I had edamame with no salt but with a garlic oil, super yummy. 

The bowl with tofu was also super good. 

A cold unsweetened green tea was the perfect drink for that delicious dinner. 

I'll be back soon!

Cheers"}
{"text":"Always come here for a great bowl of ramen! Usually stick with the same thing. Service is always great!! Parking sucks most of the time but if you want a great bowl of ramen it's worth the hassle. Patio is great for people watching. My girlfriend really enjoys the patio shows in the back. Thank the lord you opened again!"}
{"text":"CHIRASHI (Sashimi rice bowl) and Tonkotsu Ramen were really great! Takoyaki was okay. I ordered the ROBATAYAKI as well. I like the bacon quail egg, but other than that were overpriced. Shrimp tastes not fresh and eggplant is undercooked. The place is a little bit crowded. Make a reservation in advance if possible."}
{"text":"My first time at Umami and I left satisfied (and almost bursting at the seams). They have a vegan broth option which was delicious and on point. The ramen bowls start at $8, I added a boiled egg for $1 and was a happy camper. One star off because I really wish they had more veggie toppings (mushrooms, extra seaweed, Chinese broccoli) or even some fish for the protein? Also, their menu is slightly different from online so they may want to integrate the two -- we didn't get an option for the spiciness of the broth -- but I'm sure you could inquire. 

I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The best ramen place in town! I definitely recommend. We ordered 2 ramen bowls and were well displayed. The corn and spicy corn are basically the same thing as the soup overpowers the spiciness of the corn so just order the regular corn because it's cheaper. Other than that it's great! 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"In town visiting and wanting some comfort food.  

Pretty cool looking place, you seat yourself and it's not a long wait for a server to appear.

I ordered BBQ wings to start, it was ok and cooked thoroughly.  Next I ordered Shoyu Ramen with pork belly.

It looked really good, pork belly was diced up.  Wish it was sliced, makes it easier to grab with noodles.  The broth was a little too salty for me.

Overall, the place seems like a cool place to hangout and the is super friendly."}
{"text":"First time here, really enjoyed the fresh sushi. Also, servers are really nice as well. Their rolls are so unique to try!
 
Definitely we will return to this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant should change its name to Salty. If there were any umami flavor, it was overpowered by the salt.

-1 star for food: the paitan broth was too salty and the roasted pork was good, but it stuck to my teeth as if it's superglue.
-1 star for service: while the broth made my mouth as dry as a desert, the \"servers\" never offered to refill my water despite seeing everyone at the table had empty cups.

Overall, it's an okay place. It would be a two-star place if it's not located on Mill."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend twice in one week because we love it so much. I would come more often if school hadn't started. One of the best ramen places I've ever tried! The food comes out so fast and the servers are friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend to everyone and will be coming back again, probably tomorrow. Brb, bout to order another bowl!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and no doubt the food was good but an hour and 10 minutes from seated to a bowl of noodles is delivered. It's noodles for gods sake, how could it take an hour. We were a party of 5 and the place was not packed. Then one member of our party got the wrong dish. She waited over an hour for a small bowl of broth and peas."}

{"text":"About time some more culture has come to Centennial Hills. My new favorite restaurant in the area. Quiet atmosphere, pleasant staff. Food the short ribs very tender and tasty. We went two days in a row. Also the chashu ramen is like prescription drugs for the soul, yummmm good."}
{"text":"Umami is a place that offers so much! My only complaint is the price but it's fair given what they provide you: quality, atmosphere and experience.

The restaurant is kinda hidden (and exciting in this way). You have to keep an eye out for this gem. Once you find the door you have to go up a few stairs (which isn't so great if you're handicapped or older), and you'll be warmly welcomed by a host.

The atmosphere is amazing. I was so amazed at the beauty and sleek design of the interior. I felt fancy! I almost felt like I was in Japan.

My friends and I shared a lot of dishes family style. The most memorable food item I ate was the matcha sponge cake. Last time I checked, it was no longer available (so sad) but the other options are sure to impress you!

This is definitely a treat-yourself kind of place! And more so a place for those 21+! Will most certainly come again!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that provides great all you can eat and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Ok, to start with, I recently had ramen at Takumi in Okayama, Japan which is probably the best I've EVER have had in my life.  

So, it's not really fair, but I am still going to do this.

I recently went to Republic Noodle House after my trip back from Japan, after realizing that I actually CAN eat a hot noodle dish in the Summer time, without getting grumpy and fidgety.  The soup stock was bland, and the only thing they had going for it was the amount they gave you.

So, decided to give Umami a try.  Got there kind of early, around 5:30, so I was pretty much the only person there. Started talking with the chef, and realized he knew what he was doing.  He talked about boiling the bones to create the broth, a whole day and a half before serving it.  DING.

I ordered the Shoyu, with Chasu w/hard boiled egg, a side of kimchi and a Asahi torpedo.  

It was an extremely enjoyable meal. I enjoyed the broth immensely, as chef has taken the time to properly prepare it. There was plenty to eat, and it did fill me up and met expectations.  

They do have slipper chopsticks, which would have been my only qualm.  I forgot to bring my set from Kamakura, but perhaps next time.  Because there will be a next time.  And a time after that, and another time after that.  Republic is definitely a one-and-done place for me.

***Last minute add....If you go before 7pm, you get $2 off your Ramen, and the torpedo of beer is $6 instead of $8.  Happy Hour indeed."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  We had one of our best meals of the year here last night.  We started out with cocktails, based on previous recommendations posted here.  We were not disappointed as they were amazing, as was the sake.  We found the staff to be friendly, knowledgable, attentive and accommodating.  We ordered Alaskan copper river salmon off the special menu and had half of the portion served as sashimi.  It was amazing!  Some of the best sashimi we have ever had (including in NYC and Hawaii).  All of the ingredients were very fresh and cooked to perfection.  We are considering returning again during our one week trip to the Cleveland area!
And to address the portion sizes, no they are not huge but they are appropriately sized and we did not leave hungry.  Just pleasantly full!"}
{"text":"Chef Joons Umami is gone, gone . He left. This umami is now an all u can eat and the quality is like their no 5. 

It's all about quantity not quality. Giant pieces of flavorless fish. 

All the rolls were some sort of tempura or spicy blend of something and imitation crab. 

Just when the northwest was starting to get better restaurants reality sets in with run of the mill all you can eat joints."}

Yelp review
Umami
Tempe AZ
26 E. University Dr.
(480) 625-4565

Umami is easily the best ramen shop I have been to state side. Many other restaurants may have decent ramen bowls but Umami is truly a Ramen shop. The main portion of their menu is dedicated solely to their ramen, with a few selections of appetizers that go along well. 

To start the atmosphere at the location is very relaxed and enjoyable. Its located at a place called Shady Park where Umami, a pizza place and a bar are all located. This is extremely convenient if you are craving ramen and have friends that are not feeling it at the moment. It has got a comfortable open-air environment with a covered patio in the front and a decent sized back patio that resembles a small park with its grass and large trees shading the area, hence, Shady Park. 

The staff at Shady Park is extremely friendly, fast and always have smiles on. They respond well to questions about the menu, however, I don't really dive deep into the pizza side since I am there for Umami. There has been a couple times that I've been during lunch hours and they seem a little understaffed, but for the most part I have never experienced an issue.

The pricing of the food seems to be reasonable. When ordering ramen you get to build your own bowl, so you first choose the type of broth you want, proteins and finally the extras. If you are looking to stay below $10 you can still get a tasty bowl of ramen but if you're like me and want the extras, you can rack it up to a good $12-16 easily. Each addition clearly states the extra charge so you can easily manage your funds with your tastes. They do have a handful of pre-designed bowls to choose from if you are looking for something different than your norm or if you are having trouble on deciding what to get. These bowls also save you a couple dollars since they are the specials.

The food itself is amazing. When the bowl gets placed in front of me my first action is to take the ramen spoon and taste the broth. This is the true winner for this place. The flavors that come from the broth itself is absolutely outstanding. The next step is to ruin the wonderful plating of your add-ins. Decorated on top of your bowl are the additional items you wanted, placed with care and intent. The mix of colors, shapes and food make the bowl look just as good as it tastes. The main part of the meal comes from the noodles, which are always cooked to perfection. They hang in the perfect limbo of under and over cooked, where the noodles start to suck up the flavor from the broth. From the presentation to the last sip that you can muster, Umami does ramen the way it was meant to be."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. They have a small menu but it's pretty delicious, especially for those who can't decide between ramen or sushi. Looking forward to trying other menu options"}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about Umami, so I suggested it for a mid-week dinner date after work. The Chagrin Falls Umami is in the center of Main Street in the building across the street from the falls. We didn't make reservations. The place is super small with a bar area in the back; the only available table was up front at the window, which is actually nice for a date because you sit beside each other. I would suggest reserving a table due to the limited seating.

The waiter was friendly and charming; he promptly took care of our drink order, and remained attentive throughout the visit. My date had some kind of specialty beer. I had the Flirtini, which is a delicious pineapple cocktail made with a very generous amount of Tito's vodka. Talk about having a buzz drinking that on an empty stomach lol. I'd return to Umami just for that drink.

I started with a kale salad, which was very pretty with the cranberries and walnuts. The ginger peanut vinaigrette dressing was delicious. We ordered some small bites to share: spicy tuna roll, sashimi feature,and shiitake mushrooms. We both really enjoyed the mushrooms, which were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor. I thought the tuna roll was ok, but not as spicy or flavorful as I'd hoped; he thought it was terrible because he felt the rice wasn't cooked properly. I also enjoyed the sashimi, which tasted very fresh and good quality. He wasn't impressed. Hmm... either I was just too happily buzzed from my yummy cocktail to dislike anything, or perhaps he's just too much of a food snob (I'll never know since I decided not to go out with him again haha). Anyway, we didn't end up ordering anything else. 

I don't feel that I got the full picture since we only had salad and appetizers. I would return to Umami for another Flirtini, the mushrooms, and to try an actual dinner. So I will update or write another review then. As a side note, the location is ideal if you want to walk to the Popcorn Shop or Jen's for icecream after dinner, or just go look at the falls."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance and an open kitchen, but calling this a sushi place is a bit of a misnomer in my opinion. They only offer rudimentary nigiri/sashami at fairly high prices. The cooked selections - like the octopus balls are quite good and more resoanbly priced. Drinlk list not bad, but somewhat weak/small for my tastes. Overall this is far more of a $$$ than a $$ place IMHO.

The reason for 3 versus 4 stars is the level of service - while our server was friendly, we went 20 minutes waiting for  our first drink order. The food came out in a rush, then another long wait to order second round. when it gets to the point that i'm annoyed, its worth mentioning. 

I can't lay this at the establishments feet, but i found the clientele offputting somewhat. Neither my son nor i felt comfortable - and i'm the gregarious sort. Just not our kind of crowd i guess - not really hipster, but a vibe i can't put my finger on."}
{"text":"The place-
I felt like a VIP, sneaking in the back door, leading myself up a staircase, following the sounds of a live DJ on a Thursday evening at 7pm. This little hot spot is full of vibes. Good vibes. Hipster and non hipsters alike unite under the dimly red lit skinny tables. The staff is well oiled and put together, the open kitchen is fun to watch from afar - the expediter being key to shipping out dishes in a timely and orderly manner.

The drink-
Large drink menu, limited by a night out prior, one of us had a cocktail and the other had a Lone Wolf & Cub (8 oz beer and sake pour). Both were above par delicious and creative.

The food-
I tend to shy away from most food on a stick, but was convinced by my dining partner to at least share his robatayaki. Boy am I glad I did, the wagyu beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth fantastic. Chicken skin, crisp and salty. And the bacon wrapped quail egg was a burst of breakfast satisfaction in my mouf.
Just as we finished those, the octopus balls appeared. Highly raved about online, they were octopus fritters with large pieces of meat in them with a parade of sauces over, under, around and through. They were delicious nuggets and great to share. Next up was the savory pancake - cabbage, brussel sprouts, bacon, yam and dried tuna flake highlighted this number, cooked crispy and covered in more mystery saucy goodness. It is a large 'small plate' be aware. To finish the meal came the pork & shrimp shumai. Served at the perfect temperature, filling with a satisfying mouth feel, these may have been my top choice of the night (sans wagyu stick). They came with a dumpling sauce and each had a single edamame tucked into it's hat.

The sweets-
Fried ice cream, not your traditional Chi-Chi's set up. But vanilla ice cream encased in mochi then coated and fried. I didn't realize that would be the arrangement and I am not a fan of mochi in general - so I can't fairly judge the dish. But a lot of people were ordering it!

What would give it 5 stars? Knock a buck off cocktails, make the smaller plates smaller and cheaper, but otherwise, nicely done! I think I found a new date night hang out! Thanks Umami!"}
{"text":"My wife and I heard good things about this place and wanted to give it a chance. Too bad we didn't even get service.

The place was pretty empty so you would think we would get great service. I am not sure why we got little to no acknowledgement. We sat waiting to talk to a server for 10 minutes. I would have thought it was just an off night, but the table next to is received great service. Not to mention they came into the restaurant after us.

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Take it from an asian, this place was mediocre at best. 

First let me say this was somewhat hard to find; it's kind of tucked in the back corner behind the bank on 7th st and Myrtle.

Anyways, 

The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more. Starting off at $8 bucks just for the soup and a handful of noodles? Honestly it's just way too much for how little you get. Then you add your protein which can range in price. I ordered just the shoyou broth with pork for an add on of $1.50; when my bowl came out I looked at it and was thinking where is my meat? It was all shredded up into little bits.

I give it 2 stars for the decor; it was pretty nice and well lit. Bathrooms were nice as others have said. The service was ok; the two girls that served was friendly, but got lots of orders mixed up even with them numbering our tickets by seat positions.

I've definitely had better! A mile down the street is Republic Ramen it's cheaper than Umami and has a larger portion size. Needless to say I will never be going back here again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Umami after seeing that it had a few mediocre ratings on Yelp. I ordered the paitan broth with cracklings which was delicious. Try them out!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! Unfortunately, their service was aweful on a Friday night. The waitress never came by to check on us, we waited forever for our food. This place is sooo good but best when not busy. Friday nightmare."}
{"text":"Great ramen soup! They gladly modified the soup for me since I wanted it meat free. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, solid atmosphere, reasonable service.  By far the best Ramen in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my brother and we brought heavy appetites.  This place has a pretty chill vibe, it reminded me of a classic Japanese pub.  We were planning on getting a bunch of different plates and sharing them so we could try more things.  We ended up getting about 7-8 different things and I would definitely say everything was pretty solid.  The dishes that stood out to me were the handrolls(salmon, fluke, and spicy tuna), and the skewers(wagyu, chicken skin, salmon, chicken heart). If we ever came back here, I'd prob stick to those because the other dishes weren't anything special.  This place is pretty pricy($120 for 2) but I would def come back if I was in the mood for asian style tapas.

Skewers: 8/10
Handrolls: 9/10
Karaage chicken: 7.5/10
Nasu shigiyaki: 7/10"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!! I am so glad we finally have a delicious sushi restaurant here in Las Vegas!! Our waitress was very friendly always had a smile on her face and our service was super fast. The chefs make delicious sushi! Highly recommend the spicy crab roll, Sunset roll, and tiger roll. Teriyaki chicken and rice was also a delicious entrée. Prices are well within budget and I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious food :)"}
{"text":"I love sushi and have been to a lot of sushi restaurants in town. This is one of the best if not the best. The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, everything was great! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5-4 . 

The decor and vibe of the place was awesome! We liked some of the food we got. I really liked the soba noodles, skewers, and sushi. We got the ramen and it was just okay. The noodles were undercooked.. And the broth was a bit salty. I look forward to coming back and trying out other dishes though."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I were excited to try. New, small, quaint, personal... then the food came. Cali roll was decent but that was it. Goat cheese appetizer, beet salad, sashimi and scallop entree... all terrible. Waiter recommended the nairagi sashami (special) and after he brought it out (well presented and plated), I picked a piece up and before it was 6 inches from my mouth I got a gut-wrenching whiff of rotten fish... I have had bad sushi before but I have never smelled sushi like this in my life (and I am from the midwest where there are some questionable places). We were subtle about it but before we could tell our waiter, a very nice woman sitting next to us leaned over and said \"is that bad? I can smell it from over here... the same thing happened to my husband a few weeks ago\", which obviously begged the question of why they would ever come back, but I didn't ask. The waiter tried to convince us it was fine and said they'd been serving it all night, which was both laughable and disturbing. The stench lingered for about 5 minutes after he took the plate away. Scallop entre came, again looking quite visually appealing, but scallops tasted slimy and old and quality aside the recipe was poorly designed and executed.

Worst part was paying almost $70 for one entree and 3 apps... and leaving hungry and sick. We had just gotten back from a weekend in San Francisco where literally for the same prices (most places) you can eat the best food of your life. Not to sound arrogant but it disturbs my soul that these ammateurs can gouge people like this in Cleveland who probably dont know any better."}
{"text":"So happy I have a new sushi spot to go to near me! Great food and great service! Try the lobster ramen!"}
{"text":"I visited today for lunch and they were out of Ramen. It's made fresh daily in house and I must have been too early. However I had the shrimp tempura udon and I was not disappointed. The broth was so delicious and plenty of noodles. I had the lunch combo and it's a good deal at $12 for salad, sushi roll and soup. I finished it off with vanilla ice cream and espresso shot."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food!  Don't miss the amber jack sashimi and the pork gyoza! Service was awesome and we've been telling all our friends about it ever since. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered like 7 rolls and 3 appetizers. EVERYTHING was good & love the staff.

Atmosphere is nice, relaxing, and modern.

P.s. Get crunch dragon roll & jalapeno bombs."}
{"text":"Umami was the first place i tried ramen and I have loved it ever since! I've tried a few other restaurants in the area but the flavor doesn't compare and it's more than filling! It's always good to introduce friends to this place cause they always love it!"}
{"text":"Decent ramen shop in terms of space.  Fairly modern decorative.  I had Shoyu soup style with pork chasu, soft egg, and roasted corn.  The flavor of the soup was a bit too soy sauce for me.  The noodle was subpar compare to other ramen shop I have bren to.  It was a tad crunchy.  Overall ramen noodle was average.  I will probably not be heading back.  I'm always looking for hood ramen noodle shop and this just does not make my short list."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Centennial Hills! One of our favorite family spots to have sushi, ramen and teriyaki chicken. Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. The garlic edamame is a must to try."}
{"text":"Place is super clean, staff is extremely attentive, and the seafood is fresh! Going during the weekday is great because there is never a long wait. Going on the weekend if a different story but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here now for a couple months, and being sushi enthusiasts I absolutely love everything about this place. Fish is always so fresh and the staff are always so welcoming and sweet. We now try and come at least once a week, and will continue coming! Sooo recommend it! And love the big screen for my Golden Knights games!"}
{"text":"This is a great little Asian eatery on the main drag of downtown Chagrin Falls.  I went here with my girlfriend with a daily deal, so we ate at half price.  The prices would have been fairly high if not for that.  

It's not the biggest restaurant, but that's fine with me as long as I can get a table.  It's pretty dimly lit, which isn't really bad or good as that's up to the eater.  My girlfriend and I got a little cozy table right by one of the front windows.  This ended up being fantastic because it was wintertime and there was a heater right by our feet.  There was also a comfy blanket folded up next to us, which we ended up using.  In the end, we had a comfortable, tasty, and romantic evening at Umami.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a spot that served Japanese street food up until late night, and Umami did not disappoint.  Entering the restaurant was an experience by itself, as it's upstairs on the 3rd floor of the building that Round Corner Cantina is located.  The red lighting both on the way up and inside the restaurant itself gave it a surreal vibe that I thought was really cool.

The menu is basically set up as shareable and small sized plates.  The Robotayaki skewers were alright, but the items that shined for me were the larger plates, namely the Nash Shigiyaki (eggplant) and the Karaage (fried chicken).  Both were larger in portion than I expected and absolutely tasty in their own regard.  I wish I would have been more in the mood to eat here, as I was looking forward to place for weeks until 60s weather in February came around and day drinking happened.  Really looking forward to going back with a clearer mind and a larger appetite.  It is such a cool spot with a fun menu and highly recommended to those looking for a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I went here on their grand opening day for their tailgate kickoff event! I had been to Republic Ramen before and was greatly interested in something being closer to Mill Ave. 

Upon entering I found it full of people, a lot of energy, but I admit, I stood around for a few minutes, unsure if I had to wait to be seated or not (turns out, once I got ahold of a friendly staff member, it's seat yourself) 

The service was a mixed bag. When I did speak with a server, they were very friendly and energetic, but service was sporadic in quantity and quality. Some servers I saw go into extreme detail about the broth and how everything works, others quickly swooped by dropping off a menu and water. I unfortunately was never asked if I would like any of the free tea or sake specials that were going on, which I found on their event page after my meal. 

As for the food, I ordered a base of Shoyu broth ($8.00) with roasted pork ($1.50), pork belly ($2.00), a hard boiled egg ($1), Corn ($.50), roasted garlic ($.50) and butter ($.25). Apparently they have a spice level I could opt in for; I chose medium ($.25). I was a bit concerned for the additional cost of a spice level, but it was a modest up-charge so I didn't mind too much.

Upon getting my bowl, it was a fairly large size but smaller than at Republics. I couldn't find any sign of my pork belly, corn, garlic, spice, or egg, but being hungry, and with no one around, I dug in. The broth was fairly salty, but not overly so. My addition of butter helped add a velvety creaminess to the mix. The noodles were smaller in portion, but done to Al Dente standards, I really enjoyed the slight bite to the noodles, I only wish I could have had more. 

The downsides, not including my missing ingredients, was the meat! The pork had a great flavor and looked very legit, even including a but of charred skin but it was COLD. Cold meat is very off putting hen biting into hot soup, I tried to mix it up a bit more to warm it, but then my soup became significantly cooler. The flavor was great, but at least give me the illusion that this meat was fresh shredded for me and not pulled fresh from the fridge. 

The rest of the ingredients were scarce, I found one slice of naruto, one slice of seaweed, one carrot flower and three pieces of bamboo. The scallions were plentiful though. The extra ingredients that were found in the soup, while scarce, were very good. The carrot was not undercooked and the shoots were great! 

Once I was nearly done, my server came over with another bowl of soup,  but later found out that it wasn't mine. I explained that I was missing a lot of ingredients and she at least got them for me, but my soup was nearly finished. I got some more broth for free an a togo box, so it was the best I could have hoped for I suppose. 

The pork belly was a bit more on the fattier side for belly, but full of flavor. Again the meat was ice cold. The egg was creamy on the inside and not too shabby. I found from the waitress that we were supposed to spice up our own bowl of ramen, but I never received any spices to add, a shame. Overall my experience was not one of the best. I know it was grand opening day, and the place was fairly packed. I found some tables better taken care of: some had the spices table side and others got long explanations of what was offered more. I was helped by multiple servers so I place it on just bad luck and timing. My most recent one did the best she could to remedy the situation so a full tip for her! 

Overall I am not sure if this place would be my replacement for Republic Ramen. Rat offers bigger portions, more noodles and hot meats for only a few bucks and miles more. I'll come back in a few weeks and try again, perhaps it was just a case of the grand opening hectics. I hope so, because if the meat was hot, the ingredients not forgotten and the service more streamlined, I feel this place could really do something.

Once again though, the people themselves were fantastic and very friendly."}
{"text":"I'be been here a couple of times so far will definitely come back! On both occasions everything was absolutely delicious! I would suggest sitting at the sushi bar. the chefs really know what they are doing and they have given us some great suggestions which turned out to be yummy:)"}
{"text":"Got the Paitan broth with the love. Umami bomb! Great broth, nice chewy noodles and a perfectly done onsen egg. Can't ask for better...maybe a warm onsen egg. 4.8 stars overall, so Umami wins on the rounding factor."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me. She really talked it up and we took a couple of our other friends to try ramen. The food was okay, wasn't that big of a fan of the vegan shio. I won't be coming back here because of the horrible service. The same friend who recommended Umami went to Ike's to grab a sandwich since she'd eaten at Umami the day before. The waitress saw we had outside food and didn't say anything at first. Later when we were finishing up she told us we weren't allowed to have outside food and that my friend would have to pack up the food or sit out on the patio and eat (it was 109 degrees). My friend was really hungry so she went outside alone and was finishing up her sandwich. The restaurant was not busy and there was no one else out on the patio but a blonde man with a man bun (maybe the manager) felt the need to go outside, get in her face and tell her \"didn't I tell you you can't eat that here\" and pushed a trashcan towards her. She didn't want to throw away her sandwich so she packed it up. She told him our waitress told her she could sit out on the patio and eat. He left but she felt very uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. 

I understand many restaurants have no outside food policies but I think the situation could have been handled very differently. My friend went from loving this restaurant to never wanting to come back. I also love ramen in general and wanted to take my brother to this place on my friend's recommendation. I won't be taking him or anyone else here after what happened. 

The worst part was as we were leaving the restaurant this same guy was snickering at us and making sarcastic comments from behind the bar. As a paying customer the whole situation made me really upset. I hope no one else has an experience like this."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I'm a huge ramen fan and bf is a pizza man, so what could be better? Service was great, atmosphere was cozy, bar environment without the sleazy feel. Quick service and nice waiter. Little more on the expensive side but located just east of Mill this was to be expected. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious and fresh! the service by Chelsea was excellent.  Highly recommend the Red Bull roll, one of the best rolls I have ever tasted.  This was our first time here and so happy it is less than 2 miles from home. Can't wait to get back and try more of food on the menu! Highly recommend to all sushi lovers out there."}
{"text":"An interesting place with various Japanese snacks. We got takoyaki, soba, rice ball and pancakes here and all of them were delicious. Love the Sake here!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, with that being said, for the price, I expect the best most thoughtfully prepare bowl of Ramen.  It was good, but not that good."}
{"text":"Haven't had the urge to go back in 3 months. Just got back from Turks and Caicos, where everything is overpriced. It forces you to adapt and be creative. One of the dishes I made there for lunch was Ramen. I added leftover grilled pork chops and also fried up a couple of eggs. Cheap as cheap gets. The $14 dollar umami Ramen wasn't that much better. It's still hip, but I probably won't ever return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is great and prices are reasonable. This not even close to spring mountain where you expect asians eat but this is pretty decent and close to what spring mountain area have."}
{"text":"I went in for the ayce dinner, seeing that the reviews have been better. I was blown away by the food quality and taste! I order a bunch of half rolls and all if them were so good! I cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. Location is as good as you can get in Tempe, even though it was a little hard to find. The place is pretty nice inside, although from a \"business person standpoint\", they need to make the bar a little more of a BAR. No tap beers, no happy hour yet. Fair enough, you just opened, I'll give you a pass on that. However, when I go to eat Japanese, I need me some Sappuro or Kirin sake-bomber style. The beer selection and sake selection was pretty weak. Again, they just opened so no biggie.

The broth (which is the entire essence of good ramen): I had the soy based, the wife had the miso base. Both were pretty damn good. We even sampled the sea salt base, it was pretty damn good too. The noodles and \"base\" ingredients were great, plus you get the option to add additional stuff, which is cool. The bowls were big enough to fill me up....a lot (and I'm not a little guy). If you don't add at least a teaspoon of the chili oil and the packet of seasoning to the broth (and maybe some Sriracha), you are missing out. Presentation was beautiful. The wife took pictures for Instagram, but I'm far too lazy to post that stuff...

The owner took the time to chat with us a little bit. He was very personable, and seems to know what is going on. I'd totally sit back and drink some beers with him, but never caught his name.

The bad: As I said, the place just opened. The service wasn't bad whatsoever, but the knowledge and experience of the staff was so-so. I'm not going to say anything was bad service-wise, just merely saying 6 months from now I want to be impressed. The price was a few dollars more than Republic, but I'm not taking a date to Republic. I'd take my wife here for an anniversary date and not feel like we are in a fast food joint, so that is good.

Final analysis: Great ramen. I put it in my belly. Papa bear was happy. I'll be back for sure, just bring me a sake-bomb when I do...."}
{"text":"I love how you can customize your ramen choices here. Service is wonderful and I love the decor. I'm not too fond of the parking, but definitely worth coming to satisfy my ramen fix."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place!! Service was great and quick. The place was very clean. We enjoyed the music they played as well. We ordered a bunch of different kinds of sushi and all turned out great. The all you could eat was not out of control with price. They also make it very noticeable they give law enforcement and military discounts."}
{"text":"Great AYCE place. Went on a Friday night right at 5pm. Super attentive staff. Many selections to chose from. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service, but the service could have been better. We got no refills and saw the waiter once and that was for the check. But overall good restaurant. The miso ramen was good."}
{"text":"The sushi is top notch, fresh, authentic and delicious. The service was great, attentive and friendly with a through knowledge of the menu. The prices are a bargain for a restaurant of this caliber. We are so glad to have a restaurant this good in our neighboorhood."}
{"text":"I've been trying all the various ramen shops in the Phoenix area.  This is hands down the best ramen I've had thus far.  They were kind enough to provide us samples of their different broths although they did not have their Tonkotsu broth available at the time, I did get the Paitan broth although I think next time I will try the Shoyu one.

Now that being said there were a couple things I do wish they would change... Price, people have complained about the price and if you get enough add-ons the price does get pretty high.  I kept my add-ons simple this time around as I wanted to get the base experience here.  So I ended up with a reasonable $11 bowl of ramen which isn't terribly bad.  Considering they're very, very close to ASU, I figured it'd be slightly cheaper to attract the student crowd but remembering my college days the instant ramen was sufficient and much more affordable so hopefully that doesn't bit them later due to the location.

The other thing I want to discuss is the temperature, the brother came out fairly good.  It could have been a little hotter though (temperature, not spicy) as it's seems a lot of the ingredients are put in cold and expected that the broth will heat them up and cook them slightly more... unfortunately this has the added effect of really cooling the broth down more than it should.  So either the broth needs to be much hotter which might effect it's taste or they really need to pre-heat the ingredients more so it's not so drastic of an effect on the temp of the broth.

I'm still a big fan as I said as it is definitely my favorite ramen place so far."}
{"text":"Not too shabby... honestly expected more. We tried a lot. Enjoyed the rice balls. I heard the sushi wasn't worth it so we didn't indulge in that, but the sponge cake was to die for!! Lychee gelatin... yummy!!! Had a Jamaican ginger beer- which I always enjoy, and the pancake was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Came here with 5 coworkers.. half aren't into sushi.. but hey found something else and loved it! It was Halloween night so they had \"pumpkin cake\" on the house that was amazing! Great service and the \"rock and roll\" roll was my fav!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal- we've been here three times now and each time there is a huge letdown at the table.  It's like they get one or two things right and everything else is just wrong.  

One thing they always get right are the cocktails.  The bartender is great, but for the price you are paying, they better be damn good.  

I would avoid any of the sushi rolls.  We have tried them all three times hoping for something great, but each time we have been disappointed.  

More often than not, when you walk by Umami during a prime meal hour there are a lot of empty seats in an already small restaurant.  Guess that says more than if I kept writing- right?"}
{"text":"This is a new place and I'm amazed on the quality of the food. Fresh fish and great cooked food too. I'm definitely coming back to this place and try the other items in the menu. Our server Stephanie was awesome. She's friendly and attentive to our needs. Anyone looking for a great sushi joint on the north side of town, this is the best place bar none."}
{"text":"There's just nothing else like this place.  I have been going to ASU for 2 1/2 years and I am literally mad that I didn't find out about this place sooner.  I would drive across town to eat here.  Phenomenal food and super friendly staff with great menu knowledge.  As a former server, the excellent service tops it all off.  It's my favorite spot in town for two reasons: not easy to find and totally amazing.  Done and done."}
{"text":"You really should check this place out.  It's in a weird spot, but plenty of parking below in the the parking garage, and they validate two free hours of parking

Definitely get your ramen with SPAM, unless you get the shoyu or spicy shoyu (soy) broth, then the salt is a bit much.  Don't bother with the pork, it pretty flavorless and not woth the extra couple bucks

I'd go 4.5 . . . why not a 5 star?  Considerable improvement in quality from just last year, and their broths really have taken on a nice depth, but outside of happy hour, they're priced a tad higher than maybe they should be.  Once you add toppings, your $8 bowl of ramen can easily turn into $12-$15."}
{"text":"Wow, Arizona finally has a decent ramen shop, I'm impressed. The variety of broths is good and the toppings were excellent.

Place is in a crap location though. I think the address is misleading and it's hard to find. It's in the same complex as Ike's, Steak and Shake, etc. It's probably close to 7th street than 6th. It's right behind the down ramp into the parking garage on 7th street and really close to church.

Now back to the food. I got Paitan - which was super flavorful pork and chicken bone. Definitely a stronger broth than what I got at Republic Ramen. The toppings I opted for were chashu, soft egg, and garlic paste. The chashu was almost melt in your mouth with the beautiful fat marbling. And who doesn't love breaking into the rich yolk of a soft boiled egg. And as for the garlic, I got a decent smear on the side of the bowl, but not sure if I'd pay for it again.

Due to the customization, it was a little pricey at 12. However, they have cheaper options - a $10 special for chef ramen picks, sake, and a beer. I think it's good food to have if you don't want to get shit faced on Mill. Or just want good ramen."}
{"text":"This place has amazing selections, a classy atmosphere, but still casual enough to relax. Great prices. We love it!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem last night. We enjoyed the Carson roll, very fresh and delicious. Main course was the Shrimp Tempura Udon and my hubby had the Lobster Ramen. They were both yummy. The ramen was spicy and comforting. We ended with sparkling blueberry saki. We will be returning! Staff, music, atmosphere was a chill."}
{"text":"Too expensive for small helpings of average food. Tried apps. to determine if we'd go for dinner some time. Had the following:

Spicy Tuna Roll - lame. Honestly, supermarket sushi is better. Rice was cold and, worse yet, mushy. Spicy tuna was, eh at best. This item was clearly pre-made and sat in a fridge.

Pork meatballs - 4 meatballs on top of a flavorless coleslaw for $9.

Cheese dumplings - this actually was a tasty app. but, again, kinda small for the price.

Good beer list and the house cocktail list was good. But this doesn't make up for the food prices. Very nice atmosphere and good service.

We won't be back as the food was too expensive and merely average at best."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to Unami just about every week, we absolutely love this place. There roasted pork is delicious, the ambiance is nice, and the staff is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"Great place for soup. Busy and small but worth the waiting. Friendly place. Stick to the soups. Flavor sodas are cool new thing for me. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My first impression when walking in the door was \"whoa, this is dangerous and confusing.\" The narrow stairway was dimly lit by red lighting, walls were black, and you have to walk up two flights of stairs before reaching the restaurant. Might not be a good place to go to after a few drinks, haha! Despite blindly hiking up the stairs, I loved the look of the place. 

We tried some robatayaki (skewers), temaki (handroll), and takoyaki (squid fritters). Of these dishes, I recommend the temaki the most. These small handrolls were quite simple, but the \"injection\" of the house-made soy sauce was delicious and bursting with umami flavor. 

The food concept here is small bites of Japanese street food. Prices seem reasonable until the bites are served, as they are literally bite-sized. Expect to spend a good amount of money if you're looking to leave with a full stomach. This concept seems to be on the rise with hip restaurants these days, but I think it's a nice way to sample the menu."}
{"text":"Super good. Mark, our Amazing waiter, took the time to suggest rolls that are good for my daughter who is newer to sushi and more adventurous ones for my sister in law. It's a really cool atmosphere to. A little more updated than some of the others. I have always been obsessed with a different sushi place for years but we are making the switch. Love it here."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Not a bad deal with the roll, salad and Ramen but honestly, the Ramen was underwhelmingly unspectacular. You go to Spring Mountain and get Ramen, there are all sorts of different options to add like butter, corn, spice levels, but this was pretty basic. Pork belly, egg, some kind of vegetable and scallions. The flavor was just okay too (got the spicy miso). Veg roll was tasty. Service was excellent. I just won't be getting the Ramen again."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it down to Umami, and after eating there... DO NOT WAIT. It's super delicious and absolutely worth the price. 
We went with some friends and ordered a ton of food while sitting at the bar. 
Pros: The pork AND vegetable Gyoza was bomb-diggity bomb. 
The edamame was prepared perfectly and just the right amount of salt as well. 
My cocktail (7-night stay - Wray & Nephew Jamaican white rum, Kai lychee vodka, coconut lemongrass nigori, lychee calpico, lime) was absolutely gorgeous, edible flower anyone?, and tasted divine. 
We got the spicy scallop hand roll, spicy tuna hand roll, and some octopus. 
Friends ordered the fried/crispy chicken which I tasted and LOVED. 
The service was awesome, the girl at the bar slinging our drinks was pleasant and sweet. She was helpful and seemed to genuinely enjoy what she was doing. 

Cons:
Seating is slim! So keep that in mind, it's not a great place for a large group of people but definitely great for a date. 
The Miso soup is sweet, I mean candy sweet. I didn't think it was bad but our friends did not love it. It vaguely tasted like pineapple(?) if that makes sense. It was definitely heavier on the sweet than savory side. The waitress took it off my friends bill, and said she hadn't tasted it today but that it normally skews a little sweet. So take that as you will. 

I'd definitely go back here and actually look forward to it!"}
{"text":"UGH. This place blowssssssss. 

Tried the \"buy 3 get 1\" to start. Yikes. Kimchi was gross. Seaweed salad was gross. Squid salad was gross.  My boyfriend pointed out that everything was clearly packaged....and then I sadly had to remind him how I love the jarred kimchi from Asian markets and even the packaged seaweed salad from freakin COSTCO. 

We persevered through that because we read that the ramen was supposed to be bomb dot com.......

Then the server told us they ran out of vegan ramen. At 7 on a Thursday? What? Why? How? The place was empty. Like ghost town empty. 

I may have been spoiled living near LA's K-town and Little Tokyo so I try to have lower expectations.... But not low enough to eat garbage passed as fermented food or to come back to try the ramen that \"ran out\". This place clearly doesn't serve fresh food. 

Still haven't found good Asian food in this area. 
Le sigh."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch. Food is tasty and inventive. Small portions. Professional and clean."}
{"text":"Second time here...good service,clean, and good food. Only 70 capacity so it gets busy fast, but they hustle to get seating open. Our old standby was Sushi Bomb, but I like the sushi better here."}
{"text":"Great place to have sushi , scallops nigiri was good with little twist of fried garlic on the top . Sashimi combo have good selection of fresh good fishes. And last but not least sake menu is awesome ."}
{"text":"I have never been here before.  I own a property in chagrin falls.  After a long day of landscaping and cleaning my property (after a tenant moved out), I found myself here in much need of food and adult beverages.  We ordered the spicy tuna, tuna sashimi, beet salad, and goat cheese dumplings.  Along with a nice New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.  From the service to the food I give this place an A+++!! We will definitely be making the trip back to chagrin just to eat here!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Grand Canyon, Red Bull, Carson, and Volcano roll. Didn't need to use soy sauce to enhance the flavor.  A smaller selection on the specialty rolls but so far so good. We will be coming back to try other rolls."}
{"text":"For sure the best sushi place in town we have been to many, but Umami is by far excellent the chef are amazing the food speaks for its self and the presentations are AMAZING! The servers are so polite and helpful! And a great selection of Sake! A must try in Vegas 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Very good! The roast pork was awesome. Best ramen in az, definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"First, I love the atmosphere. This is a quaint tiny restaurant with ecletic details, such as the super cool lights. Second, they have excellent cocktails-- I had the one with the lychee pure and it was delicious!! Menu is creative and mouth watering--I think that it is a tad overpriced considering this is Cleveland. I had the pumpkin soup to start, which was excellent. The udon noodles with beef and vegetables was good; yet, I wanted more vegetables. Nevertheless, I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Invited my BFF here earlier this month for her birthday lunch and she was so happy with our experience.  It's a cool, contemporary spot--the samurai wall painting is a great backdrop.

Darin was our server who made sure service was top-notch. We started with the king crab and lobster ngiri, which were that day's specials. Both were delicious and generous; the lobster especially tasted like FRESH lobster, not an overbrined version that some places serve. Then we were going to have separate lunch special bowls of ramen, but because we already had sushi and were getting another roll plus pickled cukes, Darin mentioned that the ramen bowl was very large and filling and asked if we wanted to split it. Good thing we followed his lead because we would have wasted so much--instead, it was a perfect serving of umami miso ramen for each.

BFF received a beautiful complimentary tempura ice cream cake dessert served topped off with a birthday candle!  I felt prices were reasonable for the selections and quality, as our lunch bill was only $35, not including tip.  BFF is bringing her guy here and I'm taking hubby along next visit, too."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese ramen experience, plus you can add a bunch of interesting stuff as well.  Quite delicious.  Happy Hour prices are also good.  Try the Mr. Robato special during HH for ramen, a beer, and sake for only $10!"}
{"text":"Umami is our go-to local sushi spot! Their AYCE option is amazing since it includes anything on the menu - from the appetizers to their rolls. But come with an appetite if you do AYCE since you'll want to try a little bit of everything. The service has always been attentive and the atmosphere is always clean and pleasant. We've also ordered a la carte at the restaurant and have done take out and we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sushi place, totally recommend, it's also pretty cheap for sushi and high quality. For me, it fits the perfect 5/5."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Got the bacon-wrapped quail eggs, pork belly, and wagyu beef yakitori for apps and thought they were all well cooked and tasty. 

For mains we ordered: gyoza, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, ramen, and karaage. Everything was top notch. Fried ice cream for dessert was also really good, like mochi with a crispier/fried shell.

This place has a great environment. Loved the interior design - great lighting and art. Pretty small seating area but plenty of room at the bar.

Bartender was really friendly and the food came quickly. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Fun and adventurous dining at one of my favorite new restaurants in Pittsburgh. Umami has an energetic atmosphere. I love going here on Friday evening after a look week of work. I have been here twice and ordered differently each time. I enjoy the originality and complexity of the dishes. I would recommend coming hungry and sharing lots of small plates with your party. I look forward to my next trip to this fun new restaurant."}
{"text":"Good sushi, haven't tried the AYCE but I hear good things. We went with family while they were in town and didn't want to go too far with kids. In North Las Vegas this is a good sushi spot. They weren't very busy which was nice. They took our order quickly and service was great."}
{"text":"So good! The service was great, and the food came really fast. Definitely will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Mango ceviche is one of a kind. The sea urchin was delectable."}
{"text":"An average restaurant experience. It is what it is. Noodles, broth, protein/tofu, and some veggies. For what you get probably a bit on the expensive side. I think with the other options on Mill Ave this would be a rare return for me."}
{"text":"Really bad first impression. There was an overwhelming smell of disinfectant coming up the stairs and permeating the restaurant Was expecting something a little more upscale - not a fan of all the high top tables or the loud hip hop music. Service was good, cocktails were good, sushi was just OK."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh.

And by hidden gem, it is pretty hidden and hard to find (but also delicious and unique!).  Just a red glowing sign with just japanese characters on the outside, it looks like a residence.  Then you're faced with two nondescript wood doors, like a choose your adventure game.  You then trek up two flights of narrow stairs into a completely different world.  The ambiance is super cool, with the lowered tables. 

My friend raved about the robotayaki, but I found it to be slightly underwhelming.  On the other hand, the Takoyaki (octopus balls) and the Nasu Shigiyaki (eggplant) were phenomenal.  I also ordered the matcha slushee and it was one of the prettiest drinks I've ever seen.  My friends got the chirashi bowl and found it to be good, but pricey for the portion size and they left hungry."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. It's small, they seem to care about what they are cooking. You can see the chefs right at the sushi bar, which is where we sat, but the food was just ok. We had a mix of things including drinks:

Tuna Sashimi -good, really good
Miso Ramen- meh, have had better
King Trumpet Mushroom- ok
Macaroon- good
Chirashi- a little disappointing

Overall, I hope this was just opening week jitters. I think I will try it again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the cracklings on your ramen. I will definitely be back. Great menu options, great ingredients. 1st class staff, they know what they are doing. Will recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The vegan chicken nuggets are amazing! All the food is fabulous! Love that they have vegan options. The servers are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen! Andrew and Andrea are two amazing, friendly, and helpful servers. Would go again and recommend to anyone looking for bomb Ramen. 11 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place, especially seeing yelpers have given this place on an average 4.5 stars. 

A 4.5 star restaurant should have excellent ambiance, excellent food, excellent service. This Umami place has none of the above.

First the ambiance, it is quite mod but cold. Seats are not comfortable and has many TV's. Is this really a Japanese restaurant or just a sports bar serving Japanese food??

Service is horrible not because the servers tried to ignore us, rather, they need to be trained:
1. There were empty tables along the wall and the aisle, instead, the seater took us to a table right in the middle of the room with empty tables all around us. Strange.
2. Three servers came to us to take drink orders and desert orders seems to be totally un-organized. 
3. We ordered some sushi rolls. We have to ask for Wasabi and ginger which were not accompanied with the rolls. We should not have to ask for them -- it is a must condiment with sushi. 
4. We asked for low sodium soy sauce. The waitress said there should be one in the kitchen but then she came back and said all the soy sauce they use are of the low sodium variety. 
5. Server did not seem to know the menu well -- has to go and ask the chef/manager constantly. Annoying.
Although all the servers were friendly and courteous, there is a lot of training to be done.

Now come to the food:
A good Japanese restaurant must have good sushi rice as well as regular rice ( that come with the entrees ). This restaurant's rice is obnoxiously bad -- when sushi rice is hard and under-cooked, you just won't have good sushi. 
We also ordered the BBQ short ribs. Way too much Korean BBQ sauce on those ribs. 

Pricing on the food items is disproportionate. Classic rolls are only $6 each. But specialty rolls are about $15 each or more. Why such difference. 

Based on the sushi rice, this place is not worth any thing more than a 1.5 star, but since there is no half star category,  we  give this place a 2 star which is being very kind."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here. It's always my wife, my 6 year old daughter and I. The first time we ate here the owner gave us a complimentary bottle of sparkling peach saki which was amazing. The service is perfect and everyone is beyond friendly. This time we ordered a la carte for my daughter and the owner offered for her to eat free off our all you can eat. Granted she doesn't eat much but that's awesome customer service and something you never see at a sushi spot. The chef sent over a bear made out of a orange for my daughter which put a huge smile on all our faces. How can you beat that! Let me comment on the sushi real quick. The best way to put it is it's the exact opposite of what your use to. What I mean is we are use to getting large portions of rice and smaller portions of fish. At Umami it's the exact opposite. Huge portions of fish on small portions of rice. It's dang near nigiri lol. My wife and I had our first date a sushi tachi on centennial and Aliante and that has been our sushi spot for 9 Years. With out a doubt Umami is now our new favorite spot. The sushi is amazing and has the biggest variety by far out of any of the sushi spots we've been to. Great job guys! Customer for life!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! We like to try AYCE initially to see what rolls we like. Every roll was amazing! Even was able to make substitutions. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I was visiting from L.A. for the holidays. I grew up in Chagrin and return there at least twice a year. THIS is a different kind of restaurant for my hometown. And I certainly didn't expect it be better than most any Japanese restaurant found in an international metropolis, for half the price. (That does NOT mean this place is cheap. It's not. But is super cheap compared to this quality of food and atmosphere other places.)

Having had about the best Salmon I've ever had (the whole party agreed), and other quite excellent dishes, I'm surprised to see so many luke warm reviews. However, I learned that the chef working there now is someone different than a few months prior, so maybe we're just getting the goods?

I agree, I AM surprised that the chef and staff are pretty much non-Asian, AND that the chef studied in a normal culinary institute in Massachusetts, not somewhere exotic or in Asia. I chalk it up to the guy being really talented -- like a reality TV chef. (Makes me worry he won't be here long.  He'll be lured to NYC or something.)

I'm also an interior design nut, and this place it on it. The whole experience was a totally unexpected (though pricey for a Sunday dinner in the village, sure) surprise. Delightful.  No regrets. I'll be back."}
{"text":"As much as I am a fan of their food I am tired of the service they provide.
4 out of the 5 times I have gone here the staff are moody, short tempered, they look generally unhappy to be serving anyone. If you work with people you could at least look like you want to be there. 
They get angry when you order something they have run out of, which they do a lot but they get all the food fresh each day so I am not mad when they run out I simply choose another dish. They are very slow with the order process. You order a drink and it won't come out for about 10 minutes even when there are only 3 people being served. 
The one and only time I had good service the server was warm, happy, funny, just a nice guy. On my next visit I asked where he was and they said he had been let go. I guess they aren't into people who actually like their jobs,huh?

Anyway, they have great, fresh food but if you are looking for a happy face to go with it this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Walked in for a to go order and after 3 minutes walked back out. Delay in service though place empty. Started to order and the guy had no idea - said menu changed within the last week. Couldn't even name the equivalents when read him the ingredients."}
{"text":"My meal was good- very fresh fish. However, The star of the show was the garlic edamame. SO good! Prices were reasonable and service was exceptional. My drink never went empty and got on and out fast!"}
{"text":"Service is WONDERFUL ! Food is even better ! I got the teriyaki chicken bowl for lunch and you definitely get what you pay for ! Extremely happy with my visit today !"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place five stars because the food was incredible. Unfortunately it made my family and I sick the entire night. Incredibly disappointed considering it was the best sushi I was able to find in Vegas.

Edit: it was umami because I have the receipt from my delivery. Thanks though."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night, and there weren't very many people in the restaurant. However, there were only 3 people working the floor total-- 2 bussers and one person taking orders. For this reason, service was SloOOOOoOoow. I kept trying to get workers' attention, and they just kept whizzing by me, even after giving me eye contact. We were hangry to say the least, so I had to take a star off for service. There were maybe 4 other parties at the restaurant at this point.

However, the sushi was worth the wait. It was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced. I ordered a Spicy Tuna, Tamago, and an Alaskan Roll. The size of the rolls are really generous, and I was stuffed by the end! My husband ordered the dinner special-- $13.99 for meat of choice, tempura, california roll, salad, soup, and gyoza. SO much food and a great deal. He couldn't even finish it all!

Overall, I'd definitely return and try it again. I noticed a Help Wanted sign in the window, so hopefully service improves as they get more staff."}
{"text":"Best friend loves this place and has been itching to take me here.  We hit this place up before a Marquee show last week. 

It's essentially ramen DIY-style.  You pick your broth, fixins' and any extras.  The staff was super friendly, helpful and attentive without hovering.  

I'm going to be honest and say ramen bowls are just not my thing.  The broth was delicious and I could have sipped that out of a cup.  I'm just not a fan of what I call \"wet food\" and ramen bowls are wet food.  

That aside, if you're a ramen-ficionado, go here!  You will be pleased.  And leave a message for future generations on the chalkboard wall by the bathrooms.  I might have written \"boob\" because I'm a 12 year old masquerading as an adult."}
{"text":"Dim lighting! LOVE it already.
Tried the tiger roll, short ribs and the beef bowl all top notch. Must try!

They also have UDON on the menu, finally somewhere I can go on this side of town."}
{"text":"Came here for my sons 23 birthday dinner. So glad we did. Best Sushi in Town!!!
Food & service is phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch at Umami and LOVED it. My server recommended a nice white wine and the goat cheese dumplings. Awesome! A high quality (albeit light/small) meal in a comforting, very cool atmosphere. I think I'll go back tomorrow and try the tuna."}
{"text":"Had some take out from this place. An order of egg rolls and some spicy miso ramen. It was affordable and delicious! If we had more time we would have definately sat down for dinner. The menu is pretty extensive, lots of things to try next time!"}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious and the staff absolutely lovely. Best road trip stop we could have made for a late dinner!"}
{"text":"Very happy I came here to eat. It's not your basic sushi place. Different variety of food (apps, specialty rolls, etc. ) not just the same typical rolls. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant after they changed it to all you can eat sushi. The selections are great and I like it that they don't give you a lot of rice so you don't get fill up fast, very generous with the fish portions. This place is our go to all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Not bad, but after living in Asia for 11 years I'm a bit of a ramen snob....  Mostly I give them a high rating because of the execution.

The staff and friendly and helpful, the ordering is easy, the place overall is nice.  Nice bathrooms.  Parking is a bit funky but after arriving once you get the gist of it.

The ramen is a bit above the regular Phoenix ramen.  The noodles are thicker and have a firmness to them which is the way I like it.  But...and this is because of my history overseas, the broth is your typical stock with some spices added to it.  The ramen broth I'm used to is a lot thicker and bursting with flavor.  If you can see the bottom of the bowl through the soup then you're having more of an instant ramen kind of thing.  So far only Cherry Blossom's tan tan ramen meets the standard.

The price is on the high side.  It was $12.16 for ramen with pork topping and a diet coke.  After tax and tip the meal was about $15 which is a bit expensive for a bowl of ramen.  Not really filling but like I said, nice execution overall.

If you're used to Phoenix ramen then you'll probably like the place.  There's nothing particularly wrong with it so I give it good marks even if it didn't quite give me what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Just OK. Happy to swing by after all of the Yelp hype but it's just that and not much more. The menu was underwhelming. I settled on the spicy tuna rice ball and the savory pancake. Both were just average but everything was super SALTY. I ordered a pot of green tea and my mug came dirty to the table...vibe was a bit weird. Would be fun I suppose for small plates and a few drinks but don't go here with high hopes or a large crowd...quite a small establishment."}
{"text":"First time. Will be back. To die for tuna poke appetizer. Shorts ribs and chashu ramen best I have had.  Service was great. Background music good. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food, great atmosphere
Cons: expensive, small portions
Overall:
This place is a great restaurant in Chagrin-- but like most Chagrin restaurants, the price reflects the high taxes that they pay. What separates Umami from other places is that it is both expensive and has minute portions. So unfortunately, you pay quite a bit for the tasty food they serve. BUT I would say Umami is still worth the price, in certain situations- special occasions, going out on dates. But if you're just looking for casual dining, maybe look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fantastic!! I sat at the sushi bar. Very good service. Fast and prompt. Can't wait ti try the lobster raman. The place is very clean and cool looking. Sushi chrfs are nice and personality."}
{"text":"The good:
Ramen broth and noodles were very good.  Kimchi was great. Location is good. It's nice to have this kind of cuisine in downtown Tempe. 
The bad:
The contents of the ramen soup were mediocre. The \"pork belly\" was the consistency of end pieces that had fallen off the bone after a long boil. The spinach topping looked like store bought spinach in a bag that was shredded. 
Overall, I've had better soup bowls from more authentic Japanese restaurants. 
Ambience: front room is pretty inviting but the main dining room was somewhat
Bleak."}
{"text":"Had to send my roll back! It did not taste fresh and it was mushy... plus my roll came out on a dinner plate, very poorly put together. Second roll came out on a sushi plate, like it should have the first time... I WONT BE BACK TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and nice environment!! Def, would recommend the sparkling jelly sake!! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"We got both types of the ramen and loved them. I'd recommend Umami over Monta even, and all they do is ramen. I have no idea why someone would say the ramen was bland."}
{"text":"Umami for is is the best ramen spot so far that I have tried. I honestly miss their old location and they atmosphere, but when the disappeared for a long time I was sad. I'm very happy that they became apart of shady park with other great foods to try! The paitan ramen is my all time favorite. I love the variety of toppings you get get here. I recommend getting an egg and corn on top!"}
{"text":"If you can climb the narrow stairs to third floor, and if you are willing to re-think food and dining experience, Umami may be the place for you.
It's a brand new place and it is a bit chaotic, but the food, presentation, service and attitude is all in the right place.
The idea is to drink have fun and keep ordering small plates without having to worry too much about the bill, at least that was my idea, and everyone at my table had a memorable evening. The food was absolutely imaginative, well prepared  and exquisitely presented. The drinks where also imaginative and well though out.
When the bill arrived we sent it back because it seamed to be  too low, but it came back the same. (about $30 ahead with plenty of drinks)
I'll find some excuse to be back.
Great job Umami!"}
{"text":"First of, I'll admit that I came to the restaurant already biased.  My expectations were set low; why?  Because Umami Asian Kitchen is an asian kitchen run by those not asian.  I'm generally avoidant of japanese restaurants run by any type of asian non-Japanese, as well as Italian not run by italian and so forth.

On the other hand, having had Chinese food run by indians, cooking what amounts to Indian styled Chinese food, I must say that cultural hybrid cuisine can occasionally be very interesting if not compelling.

After all, American Chinese food is a thing all its own...

But what about Umami?  Is it really U-ma-mi?  Honmono desuka?

Well, it's a yes and a no.  The executive chef's Japanese influence is pretty clear in the menu selections and execution.  With Kimchi flavoured skewers, tuna tataki, assorted rolls, the Japanese beers and selection of spice balances, the nipponification is definitely in there.

It's like you took an Izakaya, simplified the menu, westernized the flavours just slightly, and also pub-i-fied the ambiance.  It's quaint, cozy and intimate - very much like a small izakaya would be like if the decor ran more western.

And I think that's precisely what this is, a westernized Izakaya.  The prices might well be out of Ginza as well, which is really the sticking point.  The food is decent.  If you were served the food without respect to the price, you'd eat an enjoy the stuff.

But the prices are a tad steep.  I don't really know the pricing schema of Chagrin falls, but this seems a little over the norm.

So, a 3 is reasonable, maybe a 2.9.

A plug for the crisp pork-belly though.  That is something I'd order and put over a bowl of rice any day.  That dish is a 4 star flavour/texture."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who knows what good asian cuisine is all about. I enjoyed the ramen it had nice broth that had a lot of flavor. The fun part is that you can pick what you want in your Ramen. Great place to bring a friend and as a college student. Also great service."}
{"text":"best food i've had in pittsburgh for a long time. I've been here 3 times and was quite happy each time. I recommend making a reservation ahead of time online since it takes a long time if you wait. The actual place looks super nice and trendy too, but it was SO hot there went I went today. 

wagyu tenderloin skewer: was good but the least favorite dish of today, was a bit just too heavy? my friend's skewer was more raw and my other friends was more tough. mine was ok but it didn't make me want to eat it 

bacon wrapped quail eggs skewer: love this shit it's exactly what it's called but with an amazing glaze. the bacon is crispy and sweet and the quail egg yolk is so smooth and melty

karaage: the sauce is so good, a bit spicy but also very creamy, it's an interesting take on the typical mayo sauce i'm used to with karaage. and the chicken is nice and juicy with a softly crispy shell! squeezing the lemon is a must also. 

pork gyoza: don't expect your typical gyoza, this has a much thicker skin but the skin was so damn crispy it was fantastic!! again this other sauce paired very well with the gyoza

zaru soba: a pleasant and light cold soba. the dipping sauce was a bit sweeter than we liked so we mixed some soy sauce and water to make it a bit more savory. the nitamago (soft boiled eggs) were really good and the salmon skewer was super melt in your mouth. 

whole branzino: was very soft and melty fish nicely grilled

deviled eggs: the nori was very crunchy and the egg was smooth. 

octopus sashimi: i don't like other sashimi so i only ate this off the sashimi plate, but the lemon peel on it was very refreshing and it wasn't tough at all. 

overall very happy with the experience and we basically cleaned the plate on everything!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten great noodles at Monta and Sora in Chinatown but nothing they offer can compare to the lobster ramen I indulged at Umami. The spicy miso broth the lobster and other seafood in the ramen comes with is not for the faint of heart but hands down the best damn ramen I've had period. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly and the noodles were on point. Seconds? Yes please!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner prior to going to a art show. 
People at the restaurant are the best friendly and helpful. Whenever I go to this place I always aim to try something new.  Last night was a grand slam oyster mushroom app. And fish both specials off the board. My wife  enjoyed a salad and the duck Breast. In addressing the cost of dinner, I can only say the value was there. We will return."}
{"text":"After moving up in this area, I've been trying to find a decent sushi place to go to without having to drive out of my way. Came across this restaurant thanks to the good reviews here and t didn't disappoint! 

Yummy sushi, beautiful atmosphere, server & chef were super friendly and engaging. 

No all you can eat, but we were totally okay with it because of the amazing quality of the fish. My boyfriend is very picky about sushi, but had no complaints! 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was a little weary of this place due to the other reviews, but wanted to try it anyway. I will start this by saying I've never had authentic ramen, so I'm just going off my taste-buds here, and am stating that Umami was really good!

Their ordering system is \"chipotle style\" as you get to pick the type of broth, protein, and veggies/extras. I chose the miso ramen with pork, roasted garlic, and extra noodles (I was really hungry). My husband ordered the special which was creamy garlic chicken broth, with pork belly, hard boiled egg, and extra noodles. Both of our bowls were rich with flavor, and were generous in its portion of meats and vegetables. Our server was pleasant and on point, and the decor was bright and modern. They even have a zen garden, which I had fun playing with while my husband used the bathroom. I will for sure be back to try some more delicious ramen."}
{"text":"Umami definitely proved to be a welcome addition to Lawrenceville's diverse and unique restaurants! Delicious food and great atmosphere. 

We had very attentive and enthusiastic service, and the open kitchen really allowed you to take in the smells and preparation. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated at the Sushi Bar right away. 

We ordered the pork and shrimp Shumai,  6 open-faced dumplings topped with fish roe and edamame, which was easy to share. Then the Okonomiyaki, a delicious pancake with sweet candied bacon. Last, the Nasu Shigiyaki, Japanese eggplant with nutty and spicy ground chicken. The texture of the eggplant is quite different from eggplant I'm used to, as it was soft but still very good. 

Everything came out quickly and practically all at once, which was a bit overwhelming, but appreciated! All in all, a great experience for a new style of food in Lawrenceville, we'll definitely be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"Really don't know what these other reviews are talking about. The ramen has a high concentration of salt. The roasted pork was salty. Pork belly was salty. Service is pretty poor as well. Waiter didn't stop by until we asked a different waiter to take our order. Still waiting for our refill on water.....in all would not recommend whatsoever. Just go to Ramen Republic it's better and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had since coming back from Japan. Often get the Tantanmen and it is always tasty. 

Thank you for the amazing ramen!"}
{"text":"It was kind of difficult to find at first but the confusion was well worth it because the food is amazing. Super friendly staff from the servers to the managers. Happy last from 3-7 and the option to make your ramen makes this place a killer. I try to make it in at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of my new favorites. The staff are friendly, personable. 

The black tea sochu shot, in the peach beer is my new fav drink. 

The ramen is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I was here on the weekend late night. The place look interested. I were there with group of my friends.
I order salmon sashimi and sushi. It was so fresh. I love this the best. My friends order whole squids, ramen, and grill pork. Everything so delicious. 
   Our sever was friendly, I think I found the best sushi place. Obviously, I will be back again."}
{"text":"I had eaten there earlier this evening because i had been trying to find a good ramen spot. It took me a little while to actually find it because it is hidden in the back and I had to ask around where it was, but when I found it I can say the layout of the place is pretty nice and the food came out rather quickly. The ramen noodles was okay (a little too much like the $0.99 ramen you can buy), the broth was good (I added some la-yu chili oil to add a little spice without killing the flavor like you would with Sriracha sauce), but the main thing I didn't really enjoy about the dish was that the spinach and carrots were uncooked and that threw off the flavor for me, it would probably taste better if they had steamed them so they wouldn't be much of a contrast to the flavor of the ramen. But over all I enjoyed it and I will probably be coming back here again when I need my ramen fix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants!! The restaurant does not seat too many parties, so I would recommend making a reservation beforehand.

I wasn't too hungry when I got to Umami, so I was looking for something light. I made the right choice going with the eggplant dish, and I savored every bite of it.

{"text":"I loved Umami! I have been dying to come here for a while now after my friend came here and raved about it! Finally, we had an open evening, so I made reservations for a Saturday night at 9:30 PM. Umami was truly a unique experience unlike anything else in Pittsburgh- for the evening, it felt like we were in another city. 

Walking up the steep steps into the restaurant, you can tell that this place is something special. When you finally arrive upstairs, it has a dark and super trendy vibe. It is pretty small upstairs and was packed by the time we got there. We were seated at a high top table along the window. I loved the atmosphere here- it was very authentic and cool. They even had a room to the side where you sit on the floor during your meal- how fun is that?! Our waiter greeted us right away and got us started on drinks. He was very helpful and informative on the menu since we were all first timers! 

After browsing the menu for awhile, we basically wanted to order everything! We decided to start with some of the skewers. The 4 of us ordered the wagyu beef tenderloin, bacon quail egg, and pork belly. All of these were fantastic- but the wagyu beef tenderloin stood out the most. This tenderloin melted in your mouth.  Chris & I also shared an order of the Pork Gyoza potstickers- also amazing! The couple with us shared 2 sushi rolls which were served differently than I have ever seen them. They were served almost like a burrito (not cut) and also had an injector of eel sauce inside of them. They both liked the sushi as well. For our meals, we all were craving the noodle & ramen dishes. The boys both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, I ordered the Miso Ramen, and my girlfriend ordered the Yaki Udon. My ramen was full of flavor and the small bites that I had everyone else's was also incredible.  We all agreed that these dishes were so unique from anything we ever had and overall outstanding!! If you haven't checked this place out- DO IT!"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat out alone but i was really craving ramen.. so I gave it a shot! The bar has a nice and laid back atmosphere I didn't catch the bartenders name but he was friendly and had a good smile. I ordered the make your own ramen with corn and hard boiled egg. Huge portion but I finished it to the last drop! It took a long time to get out especially since I was pretty much the only person there hence the four stars, but other than that was a really awesome dining experience. The waitress was an absolute sweet heart and she took really good care of me. I would really recommend this as a cheap and fun lunch option. I have yet to try there pizza but I saw one coming out of the kitchen and it looked very impressive. I hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"First time trying ramen and it was amazing. I like that you can check off on your menu what you want. They had great happy hour deals with appetizers and drinks .  the ramen itself is a great meal and I left so full"}
{"text":"This is my second go to ramen place beside Tampopo Ramen that I would recommend. They did good job with the kakuni (braised pork). I recommend adding that and soft boiled egg to your ramen. Service was okay nothing bad or spectacular. Price is competitive and in my opinion the kakuni makes it worth it.

Venue wise, nothing great. It's okay. Not really a place to bring date with unless you know your date. If you are trying to impress this isn't it."}
{"text":"Nice selection of broths and add ins.  Noodles were very good but not great or they would have made it to 5 stars. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Congrats."}
{"text":"I went to this place earlier this week and loved it. The atmosphere, decor and food reminded me of the pubs (Izakaya) I went to when I studied abroad in Japan. It's the most authentic Japanese place I've been to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best SUSHI I have had in Vegas. All you can eat is a great deal. AYCE menu is very diverse. Fish is very fresh. Great service. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"A GREAT experience!  We came in near closing and they couldn't have been more accommodating.  We weren't rushed, the food was great, and the service was on point.  

As they explained to us, they try to find a balance between authentic Japanese Raman and our american expectation of it.  I think they do a great fuckin job."}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here. We used to frequent Tamari and were sad when it closed, but it was great to find out Roger Li had opened this place and it was somehow even better. It has always been an amazing experience. Just walking up to the place on the third floor is an experience--paper lanterns, large art coating the walls, the din of people enjoying themselves before you get to the top. It's a great atmosphere that feels exclusive. Dim, trendy, intimate. The kitchen is wide open and you can watch it all unfold from almost any seat except the bar and private room.

The karaage is a necessity--Japanese fried chicken with an amazing rich gravy dipping sauce. It's generally on the happy hour menu as well. The handrolls are also very good and arrive with little pipettes of soy sauce. My favorite item from our last trip was the chirashi, a sashimi rice bowl. The robatayaki--a street food staple with skewered food grilled over hot coals--is also fantastic and something you won't see often anywhere else. Our favorites are the whole squid (grilled and cut into strips that end up being just like larger calamari rings, so don't be too scared to order it!), chicken skin, and the shishito peppers when they have them. Shishitos are generally not very spicy, but it's possible to get a really hot one every so often.

It's easy to find yourself spending more than you were expecting to here, as the menu generally encourages you to order the items a la carte and it can be a bit pricey if you start to get excited by all the options. There are some dishes that can be ordered as a solo meal, such as a couple larger ramen bowls, but mainly you're ordering things piecemeal here. It's a great place to go once in awhile for a trendier happy hour or a fun night on the town. They also have one private room with two larger tables, which can be reserved for parties and is a nice experience. Keep in mind you'll want to check for reservations in general on the weekends--it is often packed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually come to eat on weekdays but seeing as it was father's day, they wanted to treat me at our favorite sushi restaurant. I am absolutely thrilled that there is a quality sushi AYCE restaurant within driving distance from our home. When we got there the restaurant was packed and they told us the wait was going to be about 45 minutes. We've waited before during special occasions so it did not surprise me. We were actually seated earlier than 45 minutes. The wait is not my complaint. What did surprise me was that service was extremely slow. Ordering food and receiving our second and third orders took unusually long. I had to order a few things more than once because it was missed the first time around. The staff looked overwhelmed with the rush. I did notice that our usual servers weren't there. Even the owner of the restaurant had to come help take orders as best as he could. I really hope this was just a one time fluke and that this doesn't become another sushi loca. The three stars instead of 2 is because our experience isn't normally like this."}
{"text":"Took way way to long to make sushi and us in a tiny table 2 people don't fit in food was high priced and just ok"}
{"text":"Liz was amazing. I can't compliment her enough. Coming from someone thats been in the industry, well, forever that says a lot.

The food was great, drinks delicious, and a great atmosphere. Start from the first page of the menu, and work your way through trying everything."}
{"text":"Our new favorite ramen spot.  We love the pork broth and chasu.  My wife spent 6 years in Tokyo and was disappointed with some of the other local spots.  This one she loved."}
{"text":"Broth is super cold, hard noodles, super salty!!!! I'm not even trying to compare the texture of ramen vs hot pot / pho / steamed noodles. It's just that lacking of flavor which I could have prepared a better meal at home.  Other than that, service was friendly.
 
All of the add on items on the menu are ridiculous and overpriced. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"NAILED IT!!! Quality, service, taste, knowledge of product... this place totally gets how a restaurant should work."}
{"text":"Returned to Umami several times with friends and family after good food but poor service the first time and loved it. They're really on their game here and it's been a place I like to come by myself at lunch or on dates and family visits. Great decor, service has become great since my first visit over a year ago. Haven't really tried the cocktails here again but I remember liking them a lot before. Good place for beer and of course the ramen. Hearty helpings of pork belly and cracklings. The bentos are great too for a quick hangout and a beer or the great happy hour prices. Looking forward to trying the 2x size Sumo bowl with a friend sometime in the future. Happy I never give up on ramen shops especially when there's so few around this neighborhood."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Their Japanese \"street food\" is as authentic as you can get in Pittsburgh! Would recommend ordering lots of things to share since there are so many good options. 
Their kitchen is OPEN UNTIL 2AM on Fridays & Saturdays!! Great for grabbing some drinks and Japanese bar food late at night. They have a bunch of Japanese inspired cocktails, as well as a range of cheap to expensive sake. Definitely a place you're going to want to come back to so you can try everything!"}
{"text":"Great food!  My wife and I wanted a little snack so we shared the Shoyu Ramen lunch combo with spicy tuna roll and cucumber salad. The food was delicious!  We're so happy that they opened up right down the street from us. We'll definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"A cute friend of mine took me here for dinner. I think it was a date, maybe one of those unsaid situations. Needless to say we had a great time starting the evening at Umami. 

Upon entering I was immediately impressed with the decor and ambiance which enveloped me. It was literally like dipping into a trendy, cave amongst old-town Chagrin Falls. Light, modern asian decor and soft, upbeat music. The kitchen was small and open. The dining room has seating for maybe 25. 

I was excited to try the food. We ordered Goat Cheese Dumplings to start with. Fantastic. Great flavor, nicely presented. Definitely recommend. Followed the dumplings with Sesame Noodles and a seared Tuna main course. Both were tasty. I wouldn't call them amazing, but simply Asian pretty much sums up the taste. They were well prepared.

I paired dinner with a Kirin light beer, and my cute friend enjoyed a tasty Malbec. 

I had a nice experience."}
{"text":"This is one cool place.  Awesome meal and awesome service!  We sat in the side room with these cool tables where you have to step down into the seats.  

Love the atmosphere and the food presentation was gorgeous.  Great sake and really enjoyed the meal.  We ordered all the dishes to share - make sure you leave room for dessert - so good!"}
{"text":"HOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 4.5 STARS??? First they served drinks in cans, the edamame undercooked and the bowl was half full. By this point we were disappointed but stayed hopeful for the sushi. The waiter wandered around the place and gave us the wrong rolls three times before getting ours. Then tried giving our rolls to two other tables before giving them to us. My sushi was average but my boyfriend didn't like his. Randomly we smell a horrible smell, smelled like shit. It just lingered for most of our dinner and made it difficult to eat. Super disappointed to spend $50 on a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Atmosphere was nice and had a very modern look to it with their decor. We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef were very nice and interactive. The staff was also very welcoming and attentive.
The pricing was definitely not bad compared to other places. Pretty reasonable we went for dinner and the bill was better than expected. I also saw that they have a lunch option for $12 that includes ramen, a sushi roll and salad. 
My husband and I had the Screaming O appetizer (seared tuna w/radish ponzu yum yum), Lobster Ramen, Red Bull Roll (soft shell crab, spicy crab,  escolar, avocado, jalapeno, cicumber) and Strawberry Champagne Cake. All were really great choices. Food was amazing. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I loved it. I loved the fact that all you can eat was only $26 and they had about 50 items on the menu. I didn't order that much but the server still let me take some of it home. He stated with the all you can eat you're not allowed to take it home and they charge you for leftovers. As I did not eat as much he made an exception which was amazingly kind. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Okay but weak taste profile ... Needs stronger flavor ... Expensive not worth the price"}
{"text":"I came here with friends tonight and everything was great! The food was very flavorful and the service was awesome! Darin was our server and he was very nice even though he served us at 10 until closing since we decided to eat very late (I know how frustrating it is to serve someone who comes in 30 minutes before close). We will be returning--during normal business hours next time I promise!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Bartender Lindsey was super knowledgeable and helpful picking out drinks and food. Chefs feature dish was incredible and worth the money. Can't wait to come back, very impressive place!"}
{"text":"It's the return of Suuuuuper Umami!  And guess what?  They added sushi and our hearts couldn't be any happier.  Chef Jared's roasted pork chasu is still the star of the menu but some new additions appear as well.  Make sure to also check out the new Green Tea cold soba and Yakitori small plates.   Maybe a side of some fresh octopus salad would do you well too!  Keep up the great work Umami...best ramen in town hands down."}
{"text":"This is a very cheap ramen joint.  Ordered the spicy shoyu ramen for $6 each.  The broth was extremely salty make but sure you get add-ons with more veggies and meats for a few more $.  
The staff were very busy tonight but were friendly and tried their best."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!


Came here with a friend who recommended it. Upon entering, the atmosphere was really chill, lots of interesting stuff to add into one bowl. After chatting with the owner, discovered he actually studied his craft in Japan and that his noodles arrive fresh from a trusted source in California, real cool guy, attentive staff. excellent on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Super bummed after leaving this place tonight! One of my best friends and I ate here a week ago and absolutely LOVED our experience! We came in at an off time but still during lunch and was greeted and waited on by the most darling girl! She was so sweet, attentive but not hovering, and just good at her job! The food was fabulously prepared and tasted amazing! We left there SO happy about our experience, with satisfied bellies, and couldn't wait to bring our husbands back! We both raved to them about this new place and were excited to bring them back to try it! Tonight was it. The food tasted great but the husbands were not impressed. They didn't seem to find anything exceptionally special on the menu and what they ordered was just okay. But that wasn't the worst part.....when trying to pay our bill, the staff informed us our card had been declined. It didn't make sense as we were both positive we had the proper funds. Even after checking our accounts and confirming that, our card declined again. After trying a separate card and having that also decline, they realized it was their system and began trying to figure it out. After at least 30 minutes of going back and forth and trying to pay our bill, they gave us 2 options. Either pay cash (which we didn't have), or leave our card number, expiration date, and name with them to run it when the system came back up! Ummmmm no?! You want me to give you my credit card information?! No. Well, with 2 babies (8 mo old with us, 2.5 yr old at home with grandparents) that needed to go to bed, it was already insanely late and this was just taking more time. The manager had already left for the night I guess, and I wasn't going to leave my credit card info. So I had to leave my husband there, rush a crying baby home to put him to bed, send my dad back to the restaurant with cash so he could pay, JUST as the system came back up...of course. All of this trouble and absolutely NOTHING offered from the staff or manager. The manager has supposedly been contacted so it's not like she was unaware. It's not my fault their system is down and they can't accept my payment. Being someone in the business of customer service, I'm VERY frustrated with our experience tonight and my husband has made it EXTREMELY clear, we will not be returning to this establishment. As a brand new business, it doesn't look good on their watch. Sad, but we won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I had one of the most enjoyable dinners I've had in a long time. My wife and I went with two other couples. We ordered a ton of the signature drinks. A bunch of appetizers, which included sushi, clams and octopus balls. My wife ordered the whole fish and I had a whole octopus. Both specials that night. Amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the paitan with roasted pork and chashu (pork belly), and it was absolutely delicious. The location is kind of odd (but charming), and the decor inside is really nice. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. I've been there three times in the past few weeks, and I'm going back tomorrow! The cucumber water they serve is great for cleansing your palate as well. Great ramen, great experience!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh really needs an izakaya, but a good one. I was disappointed with the execution of the food during my visit. 

Karage is much better at Chaya than here. It should not need gravy, especially the type of gravy that goes over mashed potatoes.

Fried oysters were over done and hard. Not delicate at all like I would expect a panko fried oyster. 

Pork belly was also overdone.

All of the flavors leaned toward being sweet, and were flat.  Definitely a let down, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly and prompt staff, awesome decor, and it was clean! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents as our nice night out when they were visiting from NYC. While the menu looked really interesting nothing tasted as good as the menu made it sound. My dad seemed to like his dinner, but everything else tasted pretty bland to me. And it was way overpriced as well. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My first Ramen and Saki experience.   Great food with an amazingly friendly staff.  
    The Ramen with pork great.  Also try the Saki with the meal.  It's not just a meal, it is an experience ."}
{"text":"Umami is my favorite place to eat right now! I wish I lived closer so I could eat it more frequently. I love the shreaded chicken and komchi.. mmm"}
{"text":"Following a tradition of trying new restos when D&k are in town, we picked umami.    Everything we ordered was solid and in the end pretty reasonably priced for how full we were.  Keep in mind that these are tapas style for sharing and they bring them to you as they are ready.   Check out my pics for the portions -things that stood out where the octopus balls (like conch fritters), melt in your mouth sushi options, and the miso ramen that's big enough to share.   
My issues with the place were 1-it was hot, we ended up opening an unscreened window for a breeze; 2- for whatever reason, the night we went...they varied between elevator techno music and straight on techno and the speakers were directly overhead.   We will probably come back on special occasions."}
{"text":"Delicious! Tried the the King Crab roll, the spicy salmon roll, and the crunch dragon rolls! All were fresh and tasty. Our server Caleb was fast, pleasant and efficient. Kim at the sushi bar is very friendly and knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"This is a trendy little spot in Lawrenceville that is very tricky to find. 

Even when you think you found it there's still four more doors leading up to the dining area you may mistake as the restaurant.

The appetizers were amazing one of the things that surprised me is how good the chicken hearts were.

Our table also really enjoyed the fried chicken and the squid. 

They have a private dining room where you sit on the floor to have your dinner. 

Our server was great and made great recommendations because we did not know we were ordering sometimes.

We will be back"}
{"text":"Not the same owner as before. High ratings are for the old Umami. Was disappointed will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. Ive had a lobster ramen and four different sushi. Everything was made from scratch and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was wonderful evening service was wonderful our chef was very attentive and served us promptly and like royalty thank you"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST Japanese cuisine in States. I would recommend this place to my friends and family. The staffs are super nice and the foods are freshest. Also the price is cheaper than the value of the food. I would def  come again. Your girlfriend will love you more and text u faster if you bring her to this place. You should try here! BEST SUSHI IVE EVER HAD"}
{"text":"This place is good...for Pittsburgh. The quality and the quantity left me wanting more."}
{"text":"The tenderloin and chicken heart skewers are delicious. Our favorites were the shumai and spicy scallop hand roll. Our salmon sashimi was very good and fresh. I wish had our servers name, he was very informative, attebtive, and nice! We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"While the menu at Umami is mouth-watering, I found that the execution of the dishes fell flat.  The items listed on the limited menu all sound delicioius and describe unusual flavor combinations.
When we got our food, however, I was less than impressed.  Our party of four shared 3 appetizers - the umami sushi roll, mussels in a thai lemongrass/coconut broth, and a lobster salad with a wasabi aioli.  I don't describe the dishes with justice, mostly because I've forgotten the descriptions provided on the menu.  
The sushi roll was fine.  As for the mussels, the quality of the mussels themselves were ok but the tasty broth didnt add anything extra to the mussels.  On top of it all, there was no way to sop up the lovely broth.  Our server informed us that there was no bread or anything similar to eat up the broth, and on top of that, she forgot to bring the spoons she had suggested for eating the broth as a soup.
The lobster salad was a huge disappointment, mainly because it was swimming in the wasabi aioli, making each bite a thick, creamy blob with a bit of lobster hidden within.
For my entree, I had what was described as a udon/soba (i dont remember which) noodle dish with stirfried vegetables.  The dish was a little greasy and tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic spice/curry mix and soy sauce.  The vegetables consisted of mostly edamame, bok choy, and napa cabbage - certainly not the bright, crunchy veggie medley I had hoped for.  I'm not sure it was any better than something I could quickly cook up in my own kitchen.
Overall, I found the creativity of the menu to be very impressive but falling short with the execution.  The flavors were not at all balanced - they were either severely lacking or overdone."}
{"text":"The BEST easy lunch, dinner or late-night meal you could ever imagine! The ramen is flavorful and the bowls are enormous - more than I can eat in one sitting. Fresh vegetables and smoked pork with a bowl full of noodles hits the spot every time. For an extra rich fresh, add some butter and garlic - yum!! Nice having a great local spot that isn't corporate or boring to frequent in Tempe!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Umami last weekend (pathetically late to the party imo) and I'm happy to say I wasn't let down by the experience. Our server was attentive without being overbearing, which is difficult to do and always appreciated. The inside was dimly lit and stylish (much like my beloved täk?) and it seemed like a fun place to hang out and drink for a while. 

I had some yellowtail sashimi and the ginger ginger cocktail. The former was delicious, fresh, and smooth, but the latter was too sweet and lacked the gingery bite I was hoping for. It was essentially a basic Moscow Mule. My dining companion had a cocktail I liked better though (I believe it was whiskey-based) so I will try and get that next time. I also sampled some pork belly, which was chewy and sweet but not for me, and a quail egg in bacon, which I'll most certainly get next time. It might seem like an odd thing for a restaurant with so much sushi, but the savory combination of flavors in that dish was umami at its finest. I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here based off another Yelp review. Awesome service, very knowledgeable providing great suggestions. $1 Sake bombers was a smoking deal!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST soup I've ever had there last night. It's was a coconut fish chowder. Sweet baby Jesus. The food is incredibly fresh. They ran out of a lot while we were there and although some would see that as bad, I see that as fresh, being made daily, damn good- food. The ambiance is so wonderfully trendy yet warm. The staff was attentive and described the food perfectly. We ordered all specials but the main menu sounds amazing as well. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was actually really nervous to come here based on some of the earlier mixed reviews.  Since I chose this place to surprise Bobby on his birthday, I was praying to the restaurant and Yelp gods that they would send us good service AND good food and they did not disappoint!  I made our reservation for 9 on a Friday evening and Bobby was so confused when we got there!  You walk up a narrow, steep stair case to the floor above Round Corner and its like you are entering a completely different world.  It wasn't very busy around 9, but started to pick up toward the end of our meal.

Our waitress was so cute and informative.  She did an excellent job explaining the layout of the menu, any item we inquired about and gave some really good recommendations.  We ended up starting with the quail egg, chicken and shitake mushroom skewers, each ordered our separate entrée (I did the ramen with the 5:10 egg...Excellent. and Bobby ordered an eggplant dish with ground chicken and sauce per our waitress's suggestion and he also really liked it), a sushi hand roll (salmon), and the fried oyster dish.  I tried the cocktail similar to a Moscow mule and Bobby tried the pop-rock cocktail and we both had shots of the hibiscus infused sake.  Everything was a 10 out of 10 in flavor, presentation and delivery.

After we finished, we were both comfortably food and not overly stuffed.  Our bill was only $74 for the entire variety and multiple options we ordered.  I think this would be a really cool place to go back for a happy hour or just drinks and small bites, but it was also perfect for a different kind of birthday dinner I knew Bobby would enjoy.

Great food, excellent service and the decision that we will most definitely return in the future earned Umami 5 stars...and that completes my 100th review!"}
{"text":"Great experience! We had Temaki (which I love), skewers (pork belly, shiitake, chicken), karage and tonkotsu lamen. Everything was very delicious except for the tonkotsu lamen, because it was very far from an authentic tonkotsu. Professional service."}
{"text":"Food was good and prepared with care.  The place looks new and enjoyed the passionate staff.  Recommend the whole fish option (snapper)."}
{"text":"O.M.G. Eat here.  Fresh and delicious from start to finish!   Sleek decor. Attention to detail.  Clean. Reasonably priced.  Comfy seating. Spacious.  Check out original artwork on walls: amazing! Cannot wait to come back and eat more!"}
{"text":"I come here decently often and I honestly wont stop until they close it down, or drag me out after too many sakes. Their broth is the best in the valley, and I'll fight you if you mention republic of ramen being better. Just. Don't. I've had all of the broths, and it depends on my mood for which one I choose! The staff is awesome too. I'm pretty sarcastic, and when a staff matches me in that department, they get instant brownie points.


I crave umami while sitting in 115 degree weather. It's true. I'm a sick individual."}
{"text":"They have a great AYCE menu. Everything is great but when they get busy, it overwhelms them. When we went there on 3/23/2018, one of the rolls I ordered took 15-20 minutes. But the manager came and talk to us about the issues."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Best sushi my husband and I have had. We have tried many places, and this one outdoes them by a lot. The sushi looks like artwork, and tastes amazing! Service is quick, but not overly rushed. Definitely our new go to spot."}
{"text":"Super happy there is a good ramen place right down the street from where we live. Not only that, but the food is awesome here!"}
{"text":"I've been creeping on umamis yelp page since it opened and couldn't wait to go. To get there find the big glossy black door on the side of round corner cantina, climb the two flights of stairs, and you're there! I absolutely love the vibe of this restaurant. The kitchen is open so you get to see all of the different dishes come out which is awesome if you are unfamiliar with the menu. 
When you sit down you get a hot towel to wash your hands. At first I thought this was unnecessary but after I actually used it I was really happy to have it and thought it was a nice touch. Next you are offered sparkling water or tap and can order a drink. We both got the lone wolf and cub combo of a Kirin Ichiban draft beer and a falling petal shot ( cold surprisingly smooth sake with a dropper of hibiscus to drop in) this was 5 bucks which I think is a pretty good deal! The waitress showed us the highlights of the menu and we decided to get some things to share. We got the takoyaki which are delicious deep fried balls of octopus and I'm not sure what else but definitely get them.  We each got a spicy tuna onigiri, both came with a dropper of soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. I was really suprised to find that the wasabi was actually real wasabi. If you aren't normally a fan do yourself a favor and try it because it's completely different than the fake garbage most places serve...same with the ginger. We got an order of the pork gyoza, they were so good and came with a really good dipping sauce. The okonomiyaki which is the savory bacon and cabbage pancake, also amazing. And a couple skewers, the shrimp, eggplant, and bacon wrapped quail eggs. Those were awesome too. We loved everything we ordered. 
As we were leaving we saw the whole fish (red snapper) cooking on the grill. Definitely think we'll try that next time. This place is definitely worth a special trip and would be a great place for a date. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Takoyaki. Sunomono. Okonomiyaki.
If you think you'd enjoy saying those, just imagine tasting them.

The menu here is a masterpiece; well rounded, inventive, and adventurous. You are encouraged to order bit by bit and try several small plates, and this is a great place to bring friends who don't have cooties to split and share your food.

I went with a friend, and we sampled many wonderful things. The highlights were definitely the Nasu Shigayaki (pan fried eggplant topped with flavorful ground chicken) and the Takoyaki (essentially octopus hush-puppies).
I love unagi, and it was on special when we went. It was prepared like a disassembled unagi sushi roll, with the roasted eel, nori, and rice in patty form laid out artfully on the plate.

The cocktails were pure fun, with names like Godzilla Tears, Panda Panda Panda, and my favorite: Fizzy Lifting Drink! (the Willy Wonka reference works, since this place is to Japanese food what Willy Wonka's Factory is to Chocolate.)

Please, if you like Japanese food or are an adventurous eater, try Umami."}
{"text":"You'd think Phoenix would be a ramen desert... but that's not quite the case. Umami, despite the hokey inclusion of also serving pizza (they're on a college campus and have a bar, okay, you can't really blame them, right?), also serve pretty solid ramen. Don't expect anything quite as stellar as you'd get along the coast, but it definitely satisfies those cravings everybody gets from time to time. The service is also awesome, at least when I went - my order was apparently messed up (they brought out the wrong ramen entirely), and despite my insistence against any special treatment, they still brought out (on the house) the ramen I ordered even after I told them I was perfectly satisfied with what they'd served me! My one tip, however, would be to avoid the pork belly. I may be biased from having had the pork belly from Hi-Five Ramen in Chicago, but I wasn't too impressed with it here; substitute with grilled chicken instead, and you're golden."}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh. In general, though the city's been lacking in good ramen options over the past couple years, I'm finally glad to say that there is a place (this joint) in Pittsburgh that does serve acceptable ramen for the masses. The tonkotsu broth is not bad, definitely more flavorful and not as watered down as say, the broth that you get in ramen bowls at Ramen Bar, but it's definitely also not as flavorful as it could be. Noodles are pretty consistent and not too runny so I can definitely appreciate that (they have a bit of chew in them). Definitely eyed some of the other dishes when perusing the menu but I didn't have the stomach to eat everything I wanted. Will be back to try some of the other items & update review as appropriate. In general, great food & good service. Make sure to put down a reservation if you're coming on Friday nights or weekends as this place can get quite packed (it's really not that big, unfortunately)"}
{"text":"Small plates combined with sushi choices made for a fun evening of trying the variety of Umami.  All so full of flavor!  So glad we stumbled upon this unique   Eatery!"}
{"text":"This place has been sitting on my list since it first opened!  Finally we decide to go with some friends and I was so excited that we were able to get a reservation at the time we want. I've heard that that they are usually very busy even during weekdays. So check before you go unless you don't mind waiting. One of our friend been there before so we found the place very easy, otherwise it would take me a minute I think. The sign for the restaurant is very different and interesting just not very eye catching. The entrance is on the side-a small door. Then you will need to get on the third floor, when there are couple doors on each floor could be confusing. The atmosphere is very like an authentic/cozy Japanese restaurant that I pictured and seen in movies. They have private rooms(looks like so) for large groups where you will be seating on the floor just like Japanese. I like the open kitchen where you can see everything happening. 
Everything on the menu meant to be shared so we ordered a lot for the table to share. 
The skewers are super good. It might sounds weird but the chicken heart was the most flavored ones out of pork belly, squalid eggs. The second everybody favorite was the fried chicken, then the squid balls, the pancake, and fried udon. Ah, another must order is their fried gyoza. Out least favorite was the miso soup which had too much seaweed taste. The only thing I could complain about is it was a little bit too salty for my taste. 

I would love to go back there try their ramen and everything we had again and recommend it to other friends."}
{"text":"Cool concept with beautiful design, although the space is super small so be prepared to be very close to your neighbors. The decor is immaculate, and they have a cool open kitchen bar area where you can watch some of the food prep.

The food was good, albeit pricy. It's a nice authentic Japanese izukaya addition to Pittsburgh, where most Asian restaurants somehow manage to serve a fusion menu Chinese/Japanese/Thai. Highly recommended the takuyaki and the shiitake mushroom skewer, those were by far the best things we tried. The chirashi bowl was pretty good, and let's you sample each fish shashimi in one dish. The karaage was a little disappointing, not a lot of seasoning/flavor and the steak skewer was meh. There's still lots on the menu that I want to sample! 

The drinks were really good and the service was flawless, which is impressive for a new restaurant. Will definitely be back, maybe for some late night eats."}
{"text":"Umami is one of the five basic tastes, which some describe as meaty or brothy. YUM!

First - I almost walked right by this place! The restaurant is on the third floor and the bathrooms are on the second floor.  

Second- The private room looks so fancy, like it would be perfect for a birthday party, with traditional low seating and curtain for extra swankiness.

Third- The bar is beautiful and long, with an overwhelming selection of drinks. 

Fourth- If you are there to eat, sit in front of the kitchen. It looks like the opening scene in Spirited Away when Chihiro's parents eat the food made for the spirits and get turned into pigs. I ordered a bowl of ramen, but  it was so big, I had no hope of finishing it. Also, order the chicken skin on the stick. It is so fatty and yummy, perfectly crispy. 

Finally, umami doesn't just describe the food- the cooks certainly fit that description too *wink*"}
{"text":"Hellooooo *echo echo* is there anyone hereeee *echo echo* does anyone work here *echo echo*

Here's the deal. Came hungry... left hungry. Sat for 20 minutes at a table with no drinks, no food orders put in. Asked to move to the bar. Was completely ignored. Really?

Does anyone really work here? So disappointed"}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, good booze selection and fast service.

Friends had told me about Umami but I never got around to trying it. Wish I hadn't waited!"}
{"text":"My go to for Japanese! Perfectly portioned smaller style Japanese street or narrow bar Shinjuku style plates. We literally sampled the entire menu while sipping on hibiki 12 yr.

Cocktails were on point with beautiful floral hints  but I still kept loyalty to my Japanese single malts after. Sashimi was well prepared and the cuts just melted in my mouth. The wagyu was cooked perfectly and I probably could've eaten the whole cow if prepared that way.  That would be a pretty long skewer! Long enough to poke an ugly naked guy across the street (sorry had to make the Friends reference)
Temaki was beautifully presented and one of the best rolls I've had in Pittsburgh. 

Overall? Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and can't beat the price. I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"We loved the previous management, but were apprehensive about the new management and all you can eat concept. We tried Unami and had a few items about a week ago and It was very good. Tonight we went back and tried the all you can eat and it was very good. We will absolutely visit again."}
{"text":"Love love love! Great food, cool vibe. They were able to accommodate a larger group of people for us and the service was great! Would be great for a date night or night out with friends."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance to it! Great friendly workers! Love the customer service that this place has! 

As for the sushi, they have a huge variety and have the option of AYCE. We tried so many, but the roll I remember most was the Bam Bam roll! I absolutely enjoyed that roll and all the other rolls we ordered. They definitely do not skimp put on the fish neither! My all time favorite is the yellow tail. All in all you can't go wrong at this place. Everything from the udon noodles down to the sushi was delicious! 

The only downside was that I wish there were more \"real\" sushi on the menu, meaning more variety of raw fish in their rolls. There were salmon, tuna and spicy tuna that wefe in the rolls. So for those who can't eat raw, this is the place for you.

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"Under new management. Took a friend there after bragging it was of the quality as Japanese restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. The staff is attentive and nice. The food good but not as high quality in taste but mostly in presentation. The previous management presented their dishes in such a way that you wanted to take photos before eating, the menu and food excelled. The new version is average, on par with Sushi Loca in Centennial Center or Krazy Sushi  (they do all you can eat) on Elkhorn."}
{"text":"Awesome broth and pulled pork. Load a bowel up and make it lava hot"}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar. The staff is incredibly nice and the service was great. The sashimi salad was amazing. I wish they had a cocktail menu though. There list of sushi rolls however is great, it was really hard deciding on which one to try first. I can't wait to come back and try some more."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Two different experiences... both were great. The sushi here is amazing and everything is reasonably priced except maybe the drinks...they are a bit on the pricy side. Had the ramen and that is something that will keep me coming back for. What I will always order here is that strawberry champagne cake. It honestly is so worth it. I bring my children with me and I never have any problems my daughter eats some steamed rice and salad and shes always happy. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Great place!  Can be difficult to find free parking though, but I would totally return here again!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day -- it was amazing!  I got the Ramen combo and it was sooooo good.... and soooo much food.  I got a cucumber salad (yum!), a giant hand roll, and a huge bowel of ramen.  I think I ate MAYBE 1/2 the food.  Probably less.  It was easily two meals for me.  

Everything was well flavored and well cooked.  The noodles had a nice bite to them and the broth was really flavorful.  I went with four stars instead of five because I would have liked an option for a smaller lunch portion at a lower price point.  It was just so much food... and a little more than I like to pay for lunch.  BUT, simply based on the food - five stars.  If you're hungry for Japanese food, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."}
{"text":"Food: delish! 
Service: stellar!
Décor: Pleasing to the eye!
I really loved it here. Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My go to place for all you can eat! Food is delicious. I would always go to sushi neko so I'm glad this place is only 5 minutes away from me!

The night we went, there was one server, one food runner and one busser. They all worked together and were able to give us our food on time and always made sure our glasses were filled. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Not surprised this place is now reported as closed. I only went here once about 2 mos ago, and was psyched to find a trendy, unique indoor/outdoor eating concept that served Asian fusion cuisine. Great atmosphere, but the food: EPIC FAIL. Nothing tasted right. I wonder if their terrible food is the reason they close."}
{"text":"I will start off with my two main issues. 1. the vegan ramen left me far, far, far from satiated. 2. I don't need a waiter for sub $10 food especially during lunch, For lunch I am usually in a rush, and I feel bad having some one work for a 20% tip that will still be $2 or less per head, no one wins.

Back to the food, the vegan ramen had a good flavor and the noodle texture was  firm and smooth. I added some corn to the mix hoping my belly would be satisfied but to no avail it failed.  So what is a ~$7 plus tip non filling dish? A light lunch a pricey snack? I don't know.

I did love the outdoor space and the condiments (especially the chili oil) I just wish they had a less formal lunch counter."}
{"text":"My sister, niece, and I visited this place around 1:30 to 2 and it was not busy at all. There was probably three or four tables occupied including us. The place was clean and spacious with many places to be seated. AYCE lunch price is $21.95 from open to 3PM and AYCE dinner price is $26.95 3PM to close (AS OF APRIL 7th, 2018). Half rolls are an option for their signature and specialty rolls. 
---
We ordered the super white tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri, unagi, lemon salmon (half) roll, popcorn lobster (pictured), butter fly (half), Wonder Woman (half), wet dream, Japanese lasagna, baked lobster (pictured), Capt. America, hamachi kama, baked green mussels, edamame, and miso soup. 
The top three rolls I recommend everybody to try is the Wonder Woman, Japanese lasagna, and Capt. America. The Wonder Woman roll had shitake mushrooms inside which tasted amazing. Japanese lasagna was perfectly baked and not overdone (pictured). The Capt. America had some spice to it but wasn't too spicy. 
I recommend to avoid the wet dream. I've had this roll in other sushi locations and for the most part they follow the same track of tasting good. However, Umami's didn't. The roll tasted sour like they added too much lemon to it. We don't recall the roll having lemon but if it did, they definitely need to lessen the amount on the roll. 
For dessert we ordered the coffee and strawberry mochi and an affogato. You are limited to only one dessert off the menu. The desserts we ordered tasted great! 
---
The one con about this place is that service is a little slow in my opinion and the tables are weirdly sticky. When eating AYCE sushi, I want to order continuously trying multiple items from their menu. As for the tables, I don't know if the previous customer spilled a drink or something but the table was sticky and it felt gross eating on it. But despite all that, they kept our drinks filled to the rim and our hunger satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my boyfriend tonight and was very impressed. I will be honest I am not a ramen expert but we were both very happy with our meals as well as the service. I had the Paitan preparation with roast pork and the boyfriend had the miso with the chicken. The presentation was beautiful with the nori, carrot \"flowers\" and fish cake. The roasted garlic and corn extras were really tasty. Other reviews comment that the ramen is pricey, but my opinion is dinner out for two for about $20 isn't too bad, especially if it tastes good. 

I also want to add that this is a stark contrast to the \"Ramen night\" at Posh. I thought the flavors, presentation and service were much better at Umami than at Posh, and Umami is much less expensive than Posh too. 

I can't wait to bring more friends here!"}
{"text":"Even a 1-star rating is an overstatement given the fact that I threw up (literally, not metaphorically) after eating at Umami...

My bf and I went there on Saturday night. We ordered Takoyaki (octopus balls) to start with, which was pretty delicious. We then had a special roll with spicy tuna and eel, which was decent (albeit overpriced at $18), and a number of robatayaki (pork belly, chicken thigh, shrimp, chicken heart, mushroom, and eggplant). 

The \"highlight\" of the night (which we sincerely thought would be the highlight) was a grilled whole fish (red snapper). It came out slightly burned and just wasn't that delicious. We didn't finish the entire dish since neither of us liked that dish much, and both of us started feeling nauseous immediately after eating it and especially after we left the restaurant. After I got home 20 minutes later, I literally threw up... My bf didn't throw up but he had to rest for 2 hours before he started to feel normal again. 

We have no idea what could have caused the sickness; we both eat a lot of seafood on regular basis, raw or cooked. I also have a pretty strong stomach and the last time I threw up was years ago when I had food poisoning... Maybe this is a coincidence (I do hope that is the case), but we would NOT return to the restaurant again..."}
{"text":"Hesitant to post anything but a 5 star review because I really do want to see them succeed, we need more variety in the area. Really can't beat the ramen combo that comes with a salad and a roll for $12. The rolls were good, according to my son and husband. They had the miso and shoyu ramen and said they were just ok, we've had much better in town. My major disappointment was that they don't have any vegetarian or poultry based ramen, it's all pork belly. So the other kids and I had the teriyaki chicken and cucumber rolls. Teriyaki was ok, cucumber rolls were good. The service was very friendly. Based on the food alone, I would have probably given it 3 stars but bumped it to 4, hoping people check them out for themselves."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that they reopened Umami. I literally (no joke) cried when I saw that they had closed. Some of the best ramen in Arizona, no lie. 

I always get extra corn and a hard boiled egg in mine. Whichever broth that you choose is great, and they don't skimp on the meat in the ramen. 

Good place with good drink specials, too."}
{"text":"Heard about the Lobster Ramen at this place so I finally tried it. Had a large bowl of spicy ramen with the usual garnish and one full lobster tail (see attached photo).  This was well worth it and all under two $$ signs. Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"When dining at Umami it was very uncomfortable, the service was slow in the middle of the day and the tension between the employees were very transparent. The food was horrible. The noodles tasted worst than Top Ramen. The non-pork broth was just salt water. The extra toppings that are high priced. The hour long drive was not worth it. The worst ramen experience in my life."}
{"text":"A new favorite Sushi place in the NW. Try the number 5. See Benjamin. Great sushi chef. He makes sushi an art as it should be. A+ presentation.   Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"A definite MUST when in the NorthWest part of town. Just dined there tonight for our first time and we will definitely be back. The sushi was outstanding and the staff was so friendly. For me, the true test is the quality of the Salmon Roe and the preparation of the Salmon Skin Hand Roll. Both were A+"}
{"text":"First time here and is was great. Sushi portions were generous and tasted great.  Gyoza was very good and the sauce had a nice kick to it. We ordered teriyaki chicken at our table and it was good with asparagus in the veggie mix"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved the Ramen we had on our recent trip to nyc so when we returned to AZ we wanted to see what was available in Phoenix.  We.settled on umani because of the reviews and also because it seemed to specialize in Ramen. Wow great place. Not as good as toto Ramen in nyc but still so good. 

We both got the paitan broth. You can choose from shio, soy, miss, paitan, or vegan. We will,be back to try the others for sure. You can add pork belly and other items. We added spicy corn and roasted garlic. So good. The noodle.are the wavy variety and wonderfully chewy.  Service was quick and efficient. Value was 5/5. Food 5/5. Service 5/5. We will be back asap. :)"}
{"text":"Go go go! This place is wonderful!  The ambience is amazing and the food is delicious! I had the Alaska roll and Ramen. (Not sure which ramen I had, but the waiter recommended it) the sparkling peach sake is so refreshing! Loved the customer service and I can't wait to go back again to spoil myself."}
{"text":"My cousins and I went on July 4th so there weren't many people there. There seemed to be only one server so service overall was pretty slow but I don't blame them

If I were to rate it on the specific ramen I had I would give it a 2. Each of us built our own and I had the miso broth with the pork belly add on. The miso was just really salty and lacked the pork taste usually within miso ramen. The chaisu  itself didnt seem to be marinated or flavored or even cooked long enough. It wasn't hard to bite into but it wasn't tender either. It didn't have the same tenderness where it would literally melt in your mouth that most good ramen places had in their pork. Sadly to say I was really disappointed In paying 10 dollars for my ramen.. The fish cake naruto was not fresh tasting 

HOWEVER. I did try my cousins which was the paitan and that was pretty good. The broth had its depth in the pork. The egg was nicely cooked. Overall it's was really nicely seasoned. His bowl personally I would have given it a really high 3 or 4 because his chaisu was also the same as mine.

Overall I give it a three because the server was trying to keep up and they were really nice in general. Decoration and vibe was clean and fresh. But I honestly think the ramen might be hit or miss and with the price it's at, it might not be worth me coming back."}
{"text":"Holy crap

I just went there with a group of friends. Becca the chef told me about some special spicy chicken cracklings they made today for the ramen. 

I tried them (never had cracklings before)

And it was amazing. Even better than the roasted chicken I've now ordered every Friday for the last few months. 

If they have it, TRY IT!  

Also their new vanilla infused sake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow

Loved the last spot

The new one is even better. Lots more to do and hang in new location. 

Better staff. 

And most importantly- the ramen was WAY better than before. 

-and last spot already had 5 stars. 

This should get 6!"}
{"text":"The entrance is a little awkward as others have pointed out. It isn't clear how to enter and then once you enter, how to find the actual restaurant.

Drinks were great. Excellent sake selection. The cocktails were on point. The Umami bar was very well done.

Food was really good. We had ramen and robotayaki."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Very knowledgeable staff/chef and super friendly!! Our sushi came out in a timely manner and it was so good! My wife had the crunch dragon roll and the rainbow roll-she loved both. I had the Vegas roll and the superman burrito; plenty to fill up both of us!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very small space and very popular, so reservations are recommended.  We ended up ordering exclusively off the specials so on our inevitable return we'll have to order something off the regular menu.  The featured cocktail:  the cherry blossom martini was well made and the perfect temperature.  The local venison potstickers had nice flavor and was an interesting juxtaposition.  The big eye tuna special was the stand out.  It was seared perfectly.  Staff and service was friendly and helpful.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The best Ramen and service one could ask for!!!! Their broths are delicious. Never had a bad experience ... Be sure to order their special Mike's sauce which is so good it will make you smack your mama! Oh yeah, did I mention that they are open to 3am on weekends!! No more fast food for me!! #ramensogood #mikesaucefanatic #noguiltpleasure"}
{"text":"Got take out from here today. I was excited to see a new restaurant finally open at this location. The experience however, was not as expected. While the staff is pleasant, the food is mediocre at best. I had the vegan ramen with Togarashi corn, Tofu and Kimchi. The only problem was that the food came with plain corn and no Tofu, although I was definitely charged for both. The broth was lukewarm and extremely salty. Overall, a very disappointing lunch experience."}
{"text":"Authentic ramen. Noodles were cooked just right. We had Shoyu and Paitan ramen and both of the ramen's broths were excellent, but a bit salty. 
Clean and modern atmosphere. Definitely a place to try if you are craving for soup noodles."}
{"text":"The food is always solid here as well as the service.  Best sashimi in town, and I love their creative fresh fish dishes (always very flavorful) as well as their Massaman chicken.  The setting is cozy and intimate.  Take note that there is no bar to wait at before your table is ready.   In addition, reservations are a must on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant around. From the decor, the friendly staff, to, more importantly, the food, Umami doesn't let you down.  We went to Umami not too long after eating at Morimoto's in MGM and were worried about it not living up to the previous foodgasm, but Umami delivered. What a relief to have great food in Centennial Hills!  Favs: white fish carpaccio, tiger roll, karaage (exceptional), chashu ramen, and so much more."}
{"text":"I am very careful with these reviews, so before reviewing a place, I must have been to a that place at least 3 times. I have been here four times before this review.

First, you will notice that at night, this place tends to be somewhat busy, so the waiting time can be long, quite long sometimes.

The quality of the food has improved significantly since it reopened.

My first time here, I had a few sips and stopped eating the noodle due to the high concentration of salt in the broth. Additionally, the pork belly was so overcooked, blank and lacked the fat content - which is what defines the savoriness in pork belly. The soft egg was overcooked also.

On my second visit, I was able to finish most of the food. There seems to be a better balance in the broth, still it is sub-par.

On my third visit, I actually enjoyed the food! It was quite delicious. It is the complete opposite to the first visit. I was impressed and decided to make this one of my go-to - this is a big deal for me since because of my busy schedule, I eat out once or twice everyday.

Here comes the sad part, my fourth visit. After ordering food, I left the money there and left the place without getting my food - thus I cannot comment on the food this time, but I am sure it was going to be good. Before going here, I expected a somewhat long wait, so that was not the problem. Also I understand it is in our human nature to \"go to\" the people, whom we are attracted to, and it is in our understanding that serving a larger group means larger tip. But I just could not contain my disappointment when this happened.

I do not think I will ever come back to this place again and I will not recommend this place to any of my friend at ASU."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- The lights were so red and any attempt of taking picture without flash light gives redness. 
Food- the squid slices were excellent. But that's it. Other menu are over-priced for the quantity AND quality. Especially donburi wasn't really worth it. It was only full of tofu and vegetables (if I remember correctly, it isn't a vegan menu, however.) Chirasi- you get what you pay for. As a Japanese food lover, I wouldn't really recommend it."}
{"text":"This is some amazing ramen!! I was so excited to see they had a veggie/ vegan option as well! It was so good that I came back the next day for more!!!"}
{"text":"Very hip and fun place! Small restaurant where you can see into both the bar and the kitchen - so it feels very intimate. They have a large selection of Japanese beers - which is great if you're looking for that. Also a small, but refined selection of wines. The food is a bit expensive, but that can be expected of a sushi restaurant. It's a great place to go on a date or to celebrate something."}
{"text":"5000 Stars for Umami. 

Beautifully decorated dark interior custom painted murals on the walls beautiful artwork everywhere. 

My friend and I went on a Monday evening they were a little slow chef was kind enough to prepare us a delicious and  elegantly presentation of high quality sashimi, sushi, 2 pieces of grilled fish atop vegetables a pink lady roll, and the best battered shrimp I have ever had. 

Dessert was a generous slice of Strawberry champagne cake. If you live on the north side of town you need to try Umami I live 40 miles away and will certainly be back.

Thank you Chef Kim for the wonderful evening."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi restaurant I have ever found, which is tremendously disappointing since I found this place 2 weeks before moving to Idaho! Went here 3 times before leaving! 

The rolls are different, creative, & delicious. I feel like most sushi places have a lot of the same ideas going, but this place is able to think outside the box with fresh ingredients. Favorites are Salmon Tomato, Number 5, Rock n' Roll, & Superman Burrito. 

Cool decor inside & friendly staff. Parking is tight due to Buffalo Wild Wings. Would recommend parking across the street of parking lot & walking over."}
{"text":"SO happy that Umami has reopened. I went crazy without it while they were looking for their new location. Speaking of location, I think this is even better than the last. Shady Park has a great outdoor space both in the front and in the back. The concept is so cool! But, back to Umami. As always, the ramen is delicious (so addicting) as well as any of their small plates (bento boxes). I love that you can build your own bowl because I can change it up every time - and it's always amazing. Definitely find myself craving their food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really like this place (minus the constant K-Pop playing in the background). The new menu is a huge improvement, and the food is terrific. When I'm really hungry, the AYCE option is a great choice, but I really think that I like the a la carte options best. There are some Nobu knock-off dishes (yellowtail & jalapeño is just one example) but that's ok. It's nice to get these dishes at less than half the cost of the Strip. They can get packed on weeknights, so go early."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SPOT!! We've been here over a handful of times and the food was delicious. Their saki bottles aren't extremely over priced and their food is more tapas style. If you make reservations you might be able to sit in the traditional Japanese room. But Overall the vibes and food exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Umami is by far the best place in Arizona that I have found to get traditional ramen. It's a hidden gem just off mill ave. Be sure to bring a large appetite and avoid on Sunday's because they're closed."}
{"text":"when dining in the presence of not one, but TWO yelp Elite '10, do you:

a)  carefully observe their jaw movements with their every bite, and imitate them as such

b)  stand no more than 10 inches away, with napkin in hand, ready to dab at any sign of stray food

c)  answer all their requests with \"as you wish, your Eliteness\"

d)  pray that when you write a review of the place, that you might meet their kind approval-- or else be banished into a Yelp purgatory, thereby resigning yourself to a mundane life, writing for urbanspoon

just to be safe, i'd shoot for all of the above.  and so, with, napkin in hand, i had the extreme pleasure of having the distinguished company of renowned Yelpers Rachael N. and Ferdinand H. among the party this evening, as we ventured forth into Chagrin Falls.

Umami wins points for decor, ambience, and creativity;  their dishes are probably best described as asian fusion.  chicken and pork dishes are on the menu as much as fish, which was a bit of a surprise.

the entrees are broken down into small and large plates.  you'll definitely need at least one of each in order to not leave hungry.  the dishes themselves seemed pretty hit or miss.  those in my group who ordered the pork small plate dish seemed fairly happy.  i had the special-- a sashimi grade tuna with soy glaze over brussel sprouts.  it was prepared well, but not particularly memorable.  

the service was attentive and pleasant.  it's a fine place to hold conversation.  or concentrate on imitating jaw movements.

all-in-all-- a nice place in Chagrin Falls that you'll remember more for its interior than its food.

hope this review helps!

(if not-- i'll see you on urbanspoon.)"}
{"text":"Awesome Place! All I can say is this
 is the Best deal! Qualify is what they serve here. Staff is Great very attentive and Super friendly! The 2 for 1 drinks you can't beat that! Highly recommended and very  good value for your money."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for the quality of ramen. The noodles are top ramen quality. Roasted pork is actually shredded and overly salty, which made the already overly salted broth even more salty. Overall experience was meh. Wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this place. If yoi ask me. For exame If you ask for vegetable fried rice. You just get vegies, there was like NO RICE. The Sushi was okay but I would go to another sushi place to get sushi. I tried other things and they always add more than you ask for. So I literally only ordered PLAIN fried rice because everything else i had to send back. Just 2 of the waitresses  had no emotion and was a bit rude, they walked by and I smilead and they looked at me and walked away and didn't even smile back. They were the only ladies working on Sunday 3/11/18 at 9:00. please have a talk. Things to focus on...

* More emotion to customers at least a smile
* Stop going over board if someone orders white rice don't add a bunch of sauce.
*Better service. 
* Chill out on the sauce to stiff!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive out this way from the strip. After seeing the Lobster in Spicy Miso Noodle Soup fr other yelpers, we decided to end our Vegas trip by going to Umami. We arrived for lunch and was welcomed and seated by Caleb. He informed us that the lobster noodle soup was a dinner item and was not avail during lunch...what???!?, so Caleb checked with the kitchen and yay!, they made it happen...we got to have it and it was yummy. The lobster was perfectly cooked ($17). Sashimi and sushi is fresh! Decor and ambience is very nice. The tuna is the same quality you would get at Nobu. Seriously, Nobu has nothing on this place, Umami is excellent!!! Beef bowl and eel with rice for the kids was delicious. Even the garlic edemame was so good. 

Great sushi chefs. Excellent service by Caleb. Other servers were friendly as well."}
{"text":"Awesome presentation with most fresh and sweetest sashimi I've had in North LV! Service was impressive. The restaurant ambience is surely a breath of fresh air compared to the new strip.  The place was exceptionally spacious come to think of it. Great location,  great food,  great service to be more particular for a small group and gathering. $$$ for a couple or few friends but you won't regret it!  They must be proud to serve their community.  I will come back with the family."}
{"text":"I have done another review on this place. BUT i have been coming here for a few years now. ALWAYS the best sushi in town and the service is amazing. they have the help buttons for when you need to get someone attention and even on a busy night they are on top of it. Food is delicious as i said, can't be beat! (hint- try the orange blossom and the salmon killer)"}
{"text":"Mediocre.. not a single thing stood out. I was so excited to try this place because it has been recommended by a couple of people I know. However, it wasn't worth all the hype people! Place is clean, ambiance is okay, service is okay, 
food...?
Nothing really special.
Not different from an all you can eat sushi place. (Though yama sushi is much better)
Lobster ramen is too spicy, noodle doesn't taste fresh and broth is okay. (I'd recommend monta ramen for better noodle and broth)
Sushi rolls were not fresh at all. Why? 


It was disappointing. 

I'd still recommend Hachi."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for what they give.

I ordered a shio (sea salt) flavored  basic bowl ($8) with roasted chicken (+$1.50). 

The basic bowl is $8.  The description of a basic bowl is : served with pickle bamboo shoots, scallion, spinach, carrot flowers, naruto (fish cake) and nori (seaweed).

It had ONLY one 1 inch diameter naruto (fish cake) of may be less than 2cm thickness.

May be 2-3 similar slices of carrot. Similarly, 1-2 thin-thin slice of seaweed. That should give you an idea of what the basic bowl would look like. (I should have taken a picture.)  

I was very disappointed. The noodle was not well cooked, the soup was very salty and not tasty and the amount of accompanying veggy/fish-cake etc. was way too little. 

I was really looking forward to a decent eating place in this location and am extremely disappointed. 

I was planning to take my wife and friends there; but  will take them to real noodle places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Good luck on trying to find this little gem! It's definitely not an easy find, but if you're one of the lucky ones who do find it, you know just how delicious it is!

I'm not a huge ramen eater, so when my friends suggested we try this little place, let's just say that I wasn't super thrilled. But I like hanging out with friends and will try just about anything, so figured why not. And boy am I glad I did.

While the ramen bowls start at $8 and you have to pay additionally for each topping, it doesn't make it the cheapest meal. (My thoughts on this is more or less for college kids, since it's on Mill...). However, with that said, my $11 meal here, was totally worth it and suuuuuper delicious! So much so, that I'd even enjoy going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and teriyaki chicken I think my overall favorite is the Pink Lady sushi ! I have only been able to order out and there times are perfect for pick up always 15-20mins. Would love to dine in, but maybe when my daughters a little older"}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent trip through town to celebrate our 30th anniversary.  When it came down to the day of the anniversary, we couldn't figure out where to go, and decided against going to the strip. We were looking for something light and not terribly expensive.  Umami was near where we were staying and the Yelp reviews were good.  Maybe it's because we are from Seattle and have good sushi all around, but I kind of felt \"meh\" about Umami.  It was SO dark inside that we could barely even see the menus or what we were eating--I've been in dark restaurants but it was kind of ridiculous.  And it started out kind of strange because it took a long time for anyone to take our order, even though the place was almost empty and we didn't get refills on our iced teas.  The sushi was good--we had a sushi appetizer, and I had the lobster ramen and husband had a fish dish (cooked).  It's been a couple of months so I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember that we wished that there was some sort of combination where we could try a couple of different things.  We ended up switching meals halfway through because my ramen, while good, was VERY spicy.  We both enjoyed the fish very much.  Overall the food was fairly good, service was kind of mediocre,"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. Went on a Friday night and they had a live dj playing good hip hop.. The skewers were delicious especially the Wagyu, the karaage fried chicken was to dry but the gravy was delicious.. Def going back but I am gonna stick to tapas next time..."}
{"text":"Located above the Round Corner Cantina, this place is a neat addition to Lawrenceville.

We had the following:

1) Takoyaki: these grilled octopus ballz are pretty darn' good. I wish the pieces of octopus were a bit bigger but hey, I am nitpicking. These were our favorite.

2) Pork Belly: three bites on a skewer for $3 ain't bad. Love me some pork belly.

3) Japanese Eggplant: hard to get eggplant wrong but these bites were tasty as well.

4) Bacon Quail Eggs: $4 for three mini eggs wrapped w/ bacon on a skewer... these guys were delightful. Bacon is good.

5) Nasu Shigiyaki: for $9, I thought this guy would be more filling. Probably four to five bites from start to finish but had good flavor.

Drinks:

1) Gekkeikan Traditional - warm Sake in a small carafe... probably 4 servings. Enjoyable.

2) Falling Petal - cold draft Sake shot served with a dropper filled with Hibiscus. These were fun.

-Service was good. The server was friendly/patient and the restaurant encourages patrons to order in waves.

-All in all, we will be back. Small portions... order accordingly. Love that one can try a bit of everything on the menu for a few bucks. We spent under $45 for the above. I will be getting the whole fish next time and a few of the rolls."}
{"text":"I had originally given this place 5 stars I will leave my review that I originally wrote at the bottom.

After my recent encounter at this place I would given them less than one star if I could. I recommended all my friends to go here because the food and services were so amazing. So the only reason they were there was because of me. My friends decided to eat here and I went to Ike's that day to get a sandwich and I brought I back. Our waitress came to our table at first and didn't say anything and then she came and said that we weren't allowed to have outside food to eat here and asked me to eat outside in the balcony that was 109 degrees. I was starving so went outside to eat. Then another guy who I assume may have been the manager, young man with manbun and beard and blonde hair, came up to me and said didn't we tell you you can't eat here. Extremely rude. Regardless of who I am, does not make it okay to speak and treat another human being like that. Then I told him please don't approach me like that your waitress told me I could sit out here and eat, not to mention I was the only my one out there. And he told me to put my food away and I couldn't eat there. I've never in my life been treated so disrespectfully. 

A normal response I would have expected is \"hey we don't really appreciate outside food and I see you're already eating so next time please don't bring outside food\" 

I'm extremely disappointed in how I was treated and that the manger was acting like that. I will make sure to tell everyone my experience and what to expect if they go here. 

original review: 
Hands down the best ramen place I have been to EVER. I'm not that big on ramen because I haven't liked places in the past, but I've always been looking for a good one because of all the hype. And I sure did find one! I got the spicy tan tan broth with roasted prom spicy corn and garlic paste. It was simply amazing. They cut the carrot so cute in a flower shape and the fish cake as well. For me what makes this the best ramen place is the freshness, the inclusion of veges in the broth, that the broth is not too thick like other ramen places, and the service and location. I don't think I would even want to try another ramen place now that I've found this! Our service was also exceptional. I can't remember our server's name but he was just amazing and so helpful. I came with 3 other girlfriends and they all got different broths and they all loved it as well. If you don't like ramen this place also has a pizza place so for those pizza lovers who have friends who love ramen join them as well. In addition, for those of you who are vegan they have vegan only options, 2 that I noticed. I will be going back here and bringing a crowd too!"}
{"text":"This new spot in town has my number! I came here tonight for a late dinner with my girlfriend and we were not disappointed in the least. 
It was slow for a Friday night but being late I understand that could be the case in this quieter part of vegas. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. 
I personally like the bar so we found a nice corner. Drink orders were taken immediately and here we go. 
The rundown: I ordered the screaming o and a no. 5 roll. Screaming o was placed with the waitress and came first and the attentive chef took my order for the roll which he made before my eyes. 
The screaming o is a staple for me. I love it, it's great. Ask anyone that knows me, it's fantastic. In this preparation the chef portioned out the radish to fit the plate, then sliced it by the portion and proceeded to lay the tuna slices over it and drizzle the sauce. This struck me as different because when eating it ensured that each bite had the right ration of fish to radish to sauce with no biting and navigating of long pieces that typically would be nested on the plate. Rich, fresh, thoughtful. Everything I wanted. 
The no. 5 roll has Cajun albacore and cucumber inside with spicy tuna and crispy onion on top with a light saucing. This was amazing in flavor and generous in fish. You could taste the Cajun albacore even under the topping and onion. A big bite for sushi but well composed. 
All this with a Sapporo makes for a treat meal. 
My friend tried my selections and loved the screaming o but was terrified of the roll, she is a bit vanilla. Her order was a California roll and gyozas and she was satisfied.
The chef made us a delicious special after seeing the difference in our orders. It was a cut scallop bite with truffle oil and a fried garlic slice on top. It was so perfectly tender and the sweet hint of the scallop shined through. 
All in all I was incredibly impressed and will be back!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for Thursday evening at 7 PM and found it fairly crowded, but with spots still available. The venue is intimate and decor is nice, perhaps our favorite part of the experience.

We waited a bit for service, a bit of a miss. It was a wait before our server came. I ordered tuna onigiri and robatayaki (squid as the red snapper that is so photographed in these reviews was unavailable) and hubs ordered chirashi. The onigiri comes out. We're perplexed as how to approach it. We're looking around and I see others picking at it, using a soy sauce bowl to dip. Unfortunately, there's no soy sauce bowl or server around. Blah. I attack it nonetheless. It works. Taste wise, it is very average. The scallions were very mild and it was more rice than anything. A soy sauce bowl would have done wonders. I ended up spreading the wasabi using chopsticks. The squid comes as I'm working on the onigiri. Hubs has a few bites as he waits for his dish. I've finished and start on the squid for a bit before the chirashi arrives.

The squid is colder than I'd like, considering it was off the flames. Hubs thought it was his favorite item. His chirashi was very average. It was an elaborate presentation like the onigiri, but nothing that left us wowed.

Service wasn't attentive for us. Another couple sat next to our table as we were wrapping up and they were offered greater service and attention, offered tap versus sparkling as we were given regular tap, without so much as an offer for something else.

No rush to go back."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this fairly short but this restaurant goes above and beyond with their service and hospitality.  Part of this stems from the fact that they are so good to each other and that chefs Roger and Claudia are such good cooks.  Just excellent everytime."}
{"text":"Strip worthy sushi in quiet, suburban North Vegas! Great atmosphere for a night out with an extensive dinner and drink selection. You can sit at the bar and have your sushi made in front of you or grab a cozy booth or table."}
{"text":"This a group of restaurants under one roof. Was here on a Sunday noon. Amazing place to chill out with friends and have few beers. 5 starts for the ambience.

This place has a garden like self service section and  I liked it. Ordered vegan bowl with soft egg, extra spinach, sea weed. Really filling. Soup tasted awesome with red topping that was on the table.

Love to visit again for good brunch and beer. Parking sucks though."}
{"text":"TLDR; Don't buy the hype, this place is pretty mediocre. It might be 4-stars by Pittsburgh standards but it would probably be 3 or 3.5 max in a bigger city with more competition for Asian food.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken heart, chicken thigh + green onion, bacon + quail egg, and whole squid robatayaki. We also got the takoyaki, nasu shigiyaki (Japanese eggplant with ground chicken and miso), Hokkaido scallop special, and the sponge cake dessert. I'll go through each of these one by one:

The chicken heart was mostly OK. The texture could have been better, but mainly it was just slathered with too much sauce, which is a criticism that applies to many of these dishes.

The chicken thigh and green onion skewer was just sad. The chicken wasn't as juicy as at other places where I've had this dish, but the worst part was the green onion. It was so sad, thin, dry, and tasteless! It's supposed to come from the lower, round parts of the onion so that it's more substantial and flavorful, but all the pieces of green onion were from the flat, flimsy part at the top. This one was also slathered with too much sauce to let the natural flavors shine through. I want to *taste* the green onion, but instead it was reduced to a paper-thin vessel for sauce.

The bacon and quail egg skewer was acceptable.

The squid was okay, but it was served to us at room temperature, which made it a lot less appealing.

The takoyaki was again just okay. It didn't have the same kind of contrast between a slightly crispy exterior and soft, moist interior that I've come to expect from good takoyaki (though I'm spoiled since I recently came back from a trip to Osaka). I will call it a fine introduction if you've never had takoyaki before.

The eggplant was definitely the highlight of the meal. The eggplant had a nice texture and the chicken was tasty, though the flavors were too strong and salty, which pushed it towards feeling more like Asian fusion than authentic food.

The Hokkaido scallop dish was nice too. It was just raw scallop presented with some garnish.

The sponge cake dessert was awful. The so-called \"sponge cake\" was dense and hard as a rock. I suspect they just bought frozen sponge cake and dumped it on a plate. But even beyond that, the flavors of this dish were incredibly incohesive. It's as if they just tossed as many vaguely Asian dessert-y elements together on a plate as they could without thinking about how to make them talk to each other.

I will say that the presentation of the dishes was quite pretty and that the restaurant has a pretty cool ambiance. Still, in the end you have to look past appearances and judge the taste of its food. It just isn't good enough. Don't buy the hype."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, food, AND prices! The bento boxes are so much food and everything is priced really well. I had a mini girls night with a friend who needed it aaaaand it was perfect! We had the Knights hockey game on, pear sake, Sapporo beer, and amazing food! I had a sushi roll topped with jalapeño and tuna....holy crap YUM! I'll be going back for sure. Even if the service sucked next time, I would not stop going haha"}
{"text":"Bizarre location with open air on one side, so it's going to be a bit hot during summer. Staff was friendly and mildly attentive. Food took a bit longer than anticipated to come out. Large variety of add ins, but beware the prices have all increased beyond why the menu shots on yelp show. The soft egg was 3.50. My ramen was almost 20 dollars,  but I wanted it to be authentic and ordered many reccomend items from other yelpers. Very glad I did. The food was excellent and the portion was huge. Meats all tasted amazing, other reviewers trash talking the pork belly are clueless tastelets. Knocking a star off due to terrible location and ambiance, and my ramen was missing nearly all of the free included ingredients like the bamboo, naruto, seaweed, etc. Have heard it's the most authentic ramen around, and I would probably agree with that. Definitely worth a visit at least once and could be good for a date where you share one bowl with lots of toppings. Great portion! Parking is horrible, use the chase garage. This of course adds even more cost to your visit."}
{"text":"We love Umami! Although we live in Washington, DC we come to Cleveland often. Umami is our favorite date night spot. The food is always incredible and their wine list is awesome. Their salmon is my favorite anywhere! 

The cocktails are inventive and unique. I would describe the menu as Asian inspired American? Last time we went my dinner was serve a with a wild mushroom side. It was fantastic - fresh and delicious. Umami could easily compete with our favorite restaurants in DC. It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"First time was good- this round was salty salty.  Pricing adds up if you build your own ramen- stick to the $6 menu and you'll get your salty $s worth.  I will probably try again to see if this time was a fluke. Staff is nice- that's a plus these days."}
{"text":"My wife and I are eating here as I write this. Umami is truly a  righteous ALYCE SUSHI restaurant. Great choice with very fresh Nigiri. I am having some salmon belly right now. Buttery heaven. For 26.95 with a 80 minute time limit the value is right on. We love it. You will love it too."}
{"text":"Hip Hop Sushi at its finest.

Cool spot, cool peeps.

I'm coming back here every time.

Hope you like stairs! Worth the climb.


Candy Rain."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in chagrin falls.  But even if that wasn't such a low bar, umami would still be considered a great place.  Atmosphere, good food, great service - pretty much the only thing this spot is missing is enough space.  A definite go to place if you're lucky enough to get a table."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today because we had heard about this new Ramen Noodle house that just opened up the past weekend and we were SO disappointed. It's WAY overpriced for the amount of noodles you get and on top of that you have to pay extra for toppings! $1 for 1 boiled egg, $1.50 for barely a handful of chicken AND .25cents for how spicy you want the soup to be. Definitely won't be going here anymore."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with a friend and it met my eager expectations - was not below/did not succeed, but definitely worth checking out! 

I have never had Japanese street food before so this was a great introduction to it. Between the two of us, we had the plain onigiri, the tuna onigiri, the takoyaki (essentially octopus fritters), nasu shigiyaki (japanese eggplant with chicken) and the chicken hearts cooked on the grill. 

The plain onigiri was pretty meh, I would probably suggest getting the tuna one as my friend thought his had a lot of flavor comparatively to mine. 

Both the takoyaki and nasu shigiyaki were really good! The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and more chewy on the inside served with shredded beets. The Nasu dish was simple, slightly sweet, but very good!

As for chicken hearts - YOLO and go for it. If you get over the texture it's really not bad ;)

Next time, I am definitely going to check out their drinks!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible, everything I have tried over several visits has been outstanding.  The service is typically very good too, educated wait staff who are great about giving recommendations etc. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the service from the hostess stand during my last visit.  I came with a large party of 7 but it was early in the evening, we had a 5:30 reservation.  The restaurant was nearly empty at that time.  5 of the 7 in my party were there for the first time and the hostess seated us and said \"you know you're going to have to be out of here by 7:30, we have another reservation\".  Super rude and not at all welcoming to either brand new OR returning patrons.  That was disappointing but the food is so amazing, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a great night here once we figured it out.   It's different, for sure, but a nice concept and I'd definitely go back.   For starters, the service was excellent - our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.   She took the time to explain everything on the menu and overall did a great job.  

About that menu though.   I recommend that you scroll through the photos on Yelp because you can't really picture the dishes with the menu descriptions otherwise.  The menu has great variety and is well suited toward a tapas style meal.  You can mix and match a bunch of different things for a fun and satisfying meal.  We sampled a bunch of dishes and shared bites...several of the Robotayaki (yummy little barbeque skewers), both types of gyoza (super crispy dumplings), the salmon handroll (absolutely delicious), Takoyaki (octopus balls - crispy outside and soft inside - yum!), the okonomiyaki (a friend pancake of goodies), and the miso ramen (good, but I liked all the other stuff better).   We finished with both desserts - highly recommend the fried ice cream.   Overall, the food was top notch - even if we weren't entirely sure what we were ordering.   

The atmosphere of the place was nice as well, though be prepared for a few things.   First, it's hard to find, as many other yelpers have said.  The door is on the side street around from Round Corner.   You go in and are faced with two more doors - go straight.  Then up BOTH steep flights of stairs and there you have it.  Once you are up there, the space is pretty small.  We were seated in a room off the left - the Japanese style with a hole in the floor.  Ladies - this is a place for pants since getting up and down off the floor in a skirt can be a little less than graceful.       

They did not appear to have a ton of seating, so I'd say that a reservation is the way to go."}
{"text":"Although the food was very good and the prices were great , the service leaves something to be desired. Other than the service, the only two other things that bothered my wife and I was the overwhelming smell of the water and the acoustics. They probably should either invest in a quality filter system or serve bottled water. As for as the acoustics, probably putting some art on the walls would help break up the noise. I probably won't return here because we didn't think it was worth the drive from downtown Phoenix for poor service, bad water and noise."}
{"text":"This is a very hip and innovative spot. It's not hard to find the restaurant. You just go up stairs. It is small and they get crowded so make a reservation on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and stopped in for lunch today. Got there at 11am and we were the first people there. Me and my wife got a rainbow roll, tiger roll, dragon crunch, and the pink lady. All of the rolls we're amazing. After reading all the good reviews glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Can I give Umami 10 stars? 

The appetizers were good.  A bacon wrapped quail egg sounds amazing in theory but in practice really just tasted like bacon.  The chicken thigh and scallion were fantastic.  I have a shellfish allergy, sadly, and cannot eat sushi, but the fiancee says that the mackerel was outstanding, and he gave extremely high marks to the fried balls of octopus (I keep trying to think of a way to write that so it doesn't sound like he was eating octopus testicles).  

But the 10 stars, and my newfound obsession with Umami, is due to the tonkatsu ramen.  I really, really, really love ramen.  A lot.  And this is bar none the best ramen I've ever eaten.  I want to eat it three meals a day every day for the rest of my life.  

Tips/info: The restaurant is pretty small, which probably explains why it's hard to get a reservation, and you have to walk up three flights of stairs to get to it, so think twice before taking anyone elderly or who can't do stairs - you have to go up and down stairs to use the restroom as well.   It's pretty dark and loud as well, so in short, don't take your parents to eat there."}
{"text":"On our quest for the best Ramen in Arizona, I think we have found it! We went back three times in one week it was so damn good! We got the spicy tan tan (it was just the perfect amount of spice, not burn your tongue off spice) with pork belly.  The broth is so delicious you don't even need to add much. Last time I got extra noodles just to savor it longer. Apparently the chef studied in Japan and is a bit of a badass, which is proven from the Ramen! I'm going back this week!"}
{"text":"Food was just OK, but over an hour to get an entree?   Here is our not-so-great experience, followed by details about the restaurant.


The not-so-great experience...

We had lunch reservations, were seated promptly, and our order was received within 10 minutes of our arrival.  (I know these times because I had to watch the clock that afternoon.)  When we didn't see our appetizers for 25 minutes I noticed, like us, many tables had patrons but no food.  Having prior engagements, we asked to change our order to take-out, which was humbly accepted.  Appetizers were received boxed and bagged now 35 minutes after our order (see pictures) - still no entrees.   At 45 minutes after our order, we were advised that the entrees would take at least another 15 minutes - 1 hour after the order went in!   Disappointed, we had to ask them to cancel our entrees off the check, which they did, and later scarfed the meal down in the car.


The restaurant...

Umami is located in pretentious downtown Chagrin Falls along the popular strip of restaurants near the falls.  It has a narrow, slot-type layout with an aisle down the middle.   Diners are seated on both sides of the aisle in a bench-table-chair format along one wall and in booths along the other wall.  There are 10 - 12 tables inside and 2 outside on the sidwalk.   Of the inside tables, only the most outermost 2 tables are by windows.


The food...

Simply Asian fusion, emphasis on Japanese - the lunch menu featured 6 little plates and 7 large plates.  Our appetizers (california roll, goat cheese dumplings, and spicy tuna roll) were nothing exciting or dramatic to write home about - the flavors were nice but rather subtle and calm.  I found both rolls (served maki style) rather bland and \"needed\" the wasabi and pickled ginger garnish.  (Unfortunately, those garnishes are meant to be accoutrements to enhance sushi flavors, not be the sole provider of flavor.)  We were actually looking forward to trying our entrees (massaman curry chicken & the sturgeon lunch special) but we can't judge what we didn't get...


Again?

Probably not.  There are many good Asian Fusion and traditional Japanese restaurants to choose from out there both proven and left for us to explore."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Really high quality sushi, great staff, good drinks, and better steak than I've had on the strip."}
{"text":"Ok, I'd like to only give 4 stars because the place seemed almost sketchy from the outside and when you call their phone number, a pizza place answers.  Turns out half the place is a pizza restaurant and half is Asian/Ramen.  Whatever.   I had the ramen.  SO. Dang.  Good.  I craved it the next day.  I tried a ramen place tonight at Scottsdale Quarter whose ramen wasn't NEARLY as good as it was it this place.  I HAVE to go back here.  So yes, 5 stars.  For the flippin' RAMEN."}
{"text":"Ok so we have been waiting for this place to open! We love ramen made traditionally! It was really good and you can customize your order. It was a bit more expensive than  republic ramen but loved the owner and staff here. They were way cool and gave us samples of the 3 different broth choices when we asked. I def would go again based on the service. They just opened and will be adding more to the menu soon :) yay!"}
{"text":"Food was good. My wife had the ramen, which was a bit too salty. I had the takoyaki and that was great. We also had multiple orders of the rabotoyaki - 2 each of the wagyu, bacon covered quail eggs and the chicken skins, those were great too. I also was able to try my first Japanese whiskey, the Japanese Harmony, and loved it. My wife had hot sake, which she loved too. Space was a bit tight but you can let that go when you're enjoying the dining experience."}
{"text":"I am always up for trying new Asian restaurants and I can honestly say Umami did not disappoint. First, I would like to point out that if you are not into climbing 3 flights of stairs this may not be the place for you. These stairs are STEEP and after a few drinks it could get dangerous. It isn't a very large place and I could see it filling up rather fast around dinner time. My friend and I arrived around 4:15 and we were the first ones there. They have high top table seating only, so if you are not into that this also may not be the place for you. 

For our drinks we ordered the tickle n giggle. Which is basically a Japanese take on a mojito. I personally wouldn't get this drink again, but it seems to be pretty popular here. The menu is izakaya style, so you order little bits at a time. I highly recommend the robatayaki. I ordered the pork belly and beef tenderloin. Both were glazed with tare, which is like a sweet soy sauce. I also ordered the Japanese fried chicken with gravy. This was probably my least favorite out of everything we ordered, but I still enjoyed it very much. They give you a lot of chicken for it being small bites. My friend and I shared the pork and shrimp shumai, which is an open faced dumpling. There was a total of 6 dumplings and each were stuffed very generously with pork, edamame and shrimp. The next dish we shared was the yaki udon. This came with egg, mushroom dashi, shiitake mushrooms, scallion, and barrel aged soy. The udon noodles were cooked just right and all of the flavors melded together perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try Japanese street food. It is totally worth every penny for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"First time at this place...slow service for not being busy.  Vegan ramen was delicious. Prices are kinda high. They didn't seem to have everything on the menu in stock, so they definitely lost out on money for that. I'd try again, but if they don't have the vegan items, I won't be."}
{"text":"First time here based on my friend's recommendation, been here 20 minutes, only water and they just took our order!! Not impressed at all, especially with the place having 5 stars reviews here.. Waiting for the food now. Hopefully it'll me the wait better..

Update: the owner and the server came and apologized, they noticed what happened. The food was AMAZING!! And they comped some of our appetizers. Nice gesture from them.. will be back here for sure!!! Thanks for being attentive to details."}
{"text":"Great to have high quality sushi and Japanese cuisine in centennial area this place is just as great as any place on spring mountain or China town"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Best I've had in Vegas off the strip. Fast service too! Will def be back for the AYCE again"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Thursday afternoon. Cool atmosphere. Industrial chic style. We sat at the bar. There was only 1 other person in the restaurant. Service was excellent. Food was excellent.
1. Had jalapeño sushi appetizer. Hot spicy fresh yellow tail with ponzu.
2. California roll was very tasty and again very fresh.
3. Rainbow roll. Colorful presentation. Salmon was top shelf. Avocado was bright green and very fresh and crisp.
4. Shrimp ebi sushi. Largest shrimp I've ever gotten at a sushi bar. Again fresh and delicious.
5. Amberjack sushi. Nice flavor with a truffle sauce. Wasabi buried under the fish. Yum.
6. Yellowtail and salmon salad that was free compliments of the chef. Had a tangy mayo tossed in with roi on top. Was very good.
7. Spicy tuna roll. Perfectly flavored and had the nice red color to it.

We will come again."}
{"text":"To start, the food here is five stars. Period. We tried the beef tenderloin, chicken skins, and pork belly from the robotayaki menu and all were delicious. The pork belly literally melted in our mouths. We followed with the tuna, eel, and scallop nigiri. All were absolutely delicious but, as others have mentioned, a bit overpriced for the amount of food (2 pieces instead of 1 would suffice). We moved on to the pork ramen and the miso ramen, both of which were wonderful but the miso ramen is out of this world good. I would have devoured a second bowl. The crispy chili is the key. Fried ice cream dessert was nice as well. Cocktails were nothing special but good (the 33oz Asahi paired better with the meal in my opinion). 

I knocked off a star for service. A less-than-pleasant hostess informed me upon arrival that our 8:30 reservation wasn't ready yet (it was 8:30 on the dot) and to grab a drink. No big deal. However, we waited nearly 20 minutes for both the table and two drinks to be maid. Before we could even settle the bar tab, we were being whisked to our table late. Our server, who ended up being great, took nearly 20 minutes to bring water and to even ask if we were ready to order. 

The service may not have annoyed some, but it was a weird way to start what was an otherwise outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Great ramen noodles... Taste is very similar to Japan. I would suggest the serve the ramen a lot hotter so that the soup is still hot when you finish there noodles. Good seating. Music was a bit strange but not loud."}
{"text":"What a gem in the north desert. I stayed in this part of town this time and was looking for sushi after 9pm. Read other helpers reviews and could tell from the menu that this was my place. The food is as delicious as it looks. Incredibly well plated. 

I was surprised to see how many people order non-sushi dishes so I went all sushi and was so pleasantly surprised. 

Screaming O - invented in Las Vegas and I love how each restaurant has their own spin. I freaking love this dish and always order when available as no one in Cali makes anything close. Five star worthy. Tuna is fresh, sauce has that ponzu bite with a subtle spice. 

Carson roll- spider roll on crack. Soft shell crab with scallop,uhhh yeah!!!!

I will be back to try the other dishes. That's all for now."}
{"text":"We'll go good to bad here:

Price - Grade: A. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with how reasonably priced everything on the menu was.

Food - Grade: B. The Bacon Quail Egg and Pork & Shrimp Shumai were bomb. The Chicken Heart, Salmon sashimi, and Tonkotsu Ramen were all good, but nothing to write home about. The Spicy Tuna Riceball and Tableside Tofu definitely missed their marks. The Riceball was just that - a ball of rice. The amount of tuna was very disappointing; and there was slightly steamed seaweed on the outside making for a very chewy experience. The Tableside Tofu was not good - it was like a flavorless pudding. There were sauces provided, but the method to eat it was frustratingly difficult. We were given one small bowl with one spoon for two people. So we opted to both eat out of the serving bowl; I gave my wife the one spoon and I used a ladle. Why didn't we just ask for another utensil? I'll get to that...

Service - Grade: D. Comically bad actually. The fact that we just kept laughing about how bad it was ended up making for a pretty enjoyable experience for us and bumped the Grade up from an F. 
The dining experience starts off with a guy asking if we'd gotten a hot towel yet. Seems like an easy thing to keep track of, but we reply no. He leaves and returns a few minutes later with below room temperature towels. My wife and I just look at each other and laugh. 
The waiter then shows up and describes how the Umami menu works. 'We do things a bit differently here and don't do traditional courses. Rather than ordering appetizers, then entrees, then dessert, you order as you go. You're in the driver's seat. On the left side of the menu, you see our smaller plates. I recommend starting with those. In the middle and right side of the menu, you see our larger plates. And at the bottom right, you can find some great plates to finish your meal with.'
So..you just described every other f***ing restaurant in the world. Despite claiming to be really changing things up. 
Against his recommendation of ordering food as we finished them, we ordered our first 3 plates at once. And we were glad we did. After the first one showed up and we finished, the waiter was MIA for at least 20 minutes. I'm 90% sure he went to the back to do some blow because he came back all sorts of on edge. 
The Towel Guy then returns to ask us if we had received a hot towel yet. No joke. 
The missteps and fumbling continued throughout our meal. Like I said, we found it quite funny how bad it was, but I'm sure not everyone would.

Overall, it feels like they're trying so hard to be taken seriously, and just fell short. I would not go back to Umami.

Also, not sure how they sidestepped ADA requirements, but there are 2 flights of narrow stairs with disorienting wallpaper to enter the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite Sushi Restaurant. Umami had excellent service, sushi, and large fish portions. The  staff was friendly and helpful when I asked questions. I will be eating here a lot."}
{"text":"The food was amaaaazing. I would have given it 5 stars if the service had matched the food. We probably got unlucky with a bad server. She did not bother to come check in during the meal to ask us if we wanted something else, we had to flag her down to get her attention so we could order more of the delicious food. In contrast the server for the table next to us came by three times after bringing them their meal!!!"}
{"text":"I definitely love the new location. I was bummed when Umami closed down, but saw that it reopened and had to come try. At first it was a bit confusing trying to find it because it didn't look like a ramen place. It's located inside shady park and it has a great outdoor space both in front and back of the restaurant. When we went for dinner on Friday there was live music in the back outdoor area which was nice. I ordered the tan tan men with pork belly and hard boiled egg and my husband ordered the ramen with pork belly, egg and spam. The broth had a nice little kick ( it could have been more spicy for me) but overall good. The waitress accident added fried chicken to my ramen ( which at first I was super confused because I've never seen fried chicken in ramen lol ) and forgot the egg but she was nice about not charging me for the chicken and brought my egg out on the side. One of the things I enjoy about umami is that you can build your own ramen. Extra toppings range from .50-$2.00 so your ramen can easily add up fast but I've never had a bad experience when I ate here and on a cold day, ramen tastes so good! Definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their sushi is delicious and fresh...all you can eat is exceptionally priced and includes everything, even dessert! If you do the ayce, I definitely recommend the yuzu yellowtail and 300 albacore. I've tried most things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. Service is always great, there's never a long wait, and it's great for families, dates, or by yourself! If you go solo sit at the sushi bar and the chef will recommend things for you to try based on your preferences. If you haven't gone here you're missing out!"}
{"text":"My bartender was the bomb.com.. His name was Chris! He made the best cocktails.. Also the food was to dieeeee for!! Love this place. I would recommend to any & everyone!"}
{"text":"Can we all agree that the phrase \"hidden gem\" is beyond played out?

Okay - now that we've got that behind us, Umami is that and then some.

A favorite of mine, especially throughout the frigid Cleveland winters, this warm and inviting establishment reliably offers nothing but lovely experiences. So, when friends (with high expectations and an appetite for quality seafood) were in town from Boston last week, I knew exactly where to make reservations. 

Much appreciated was that the manager was kind and accommodating enough to make room for a party of six with slightly short notice (and on a popular evening with the holidays quickly approaching) - not such an easy task for a quaint restaurant. The server was knowledgable, the food was superb, and the atmosphere was perfect - lively and somehow festive, as we celebrated our valuable time with close friends.

Thank you, Umami, for being just what your name suggests - a beautiful taste."}
{"text":"I came back to Umami since my friend wanted to try this place. I made reservations surprise him and to make sure that we were going to be able to get a table. As soon as we got there, we got seated to our table. The atmosphere in this place was nice and relaxing. Our waitress was nice and attentive. To our disappointment, the food was not what we expected. We ordered takoyaki, sashimi platter, spicy tuna hand roll, udon and tonkatsu ramen. The takoyaki was overcooked and the texture was harder than other takoyaki that I've had tried. The hand roll was okay but so not worth $10. I got the udon which Is my go to but the udon was so salty that it was hard eating it. The most disappointing one was the ramen which had no flavor at all. Ramen usually has a really flavorful broth. This ramen had no flavor but the chilly oil and the meat tasted like nothing. We were very disappointed in our food as it was not worth spending over $80 (including tip) for this meal. I wouldn't recommend this place as there are other restaurants that offer better quality of food for a better price but if you're more concerned with atmosphere, by any means try it."}
{"text":"Great experience!!!  Fresh sushi. Reasonable pricing. Good service. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was expecting a whole lot more from this neighborhood gem.  First, the best thing going for this place is it's quaint, romantic dining room. The two tables near the window are very cute and offer a nice alternative to a traditional table or sitting at a bar.  Second, the service was just good. I had to ask of their we're specials and then for how much they cost. I expect a server to offer the special right away.  Third and most importantly, the food. This is where Umami loses lots of points for me. We ordered 5 dishes: 1 app, 2 small plates and 2 large plates. 2 dishes had soy in them (buckwheat noodles with seared tuna and fried vegetable roll with sauce), yet both we're under seasoned.  The tuna was cooked perfectly, but when it's atop bland noodles and cauliflower, throwing soy sauce on it isn't an effective fix. The other dishes weren't memorable: the goat cheese dumplings were a faint attempt at sophistication, but lacked flavor. The edamame hummus served with crispy wonton skins. That was tasty, however it was studded throughout with whole roasted garlic, which should have been very nice, but the garlic was undercooked and still had a bite.  The last dish was the udon noodle dish, which was also soy based, and the beef, noodles and vegetables were well cooked, but again was terribly under seasoned.  In summary, all the dishes had great potential, but all of them failed poorly at achieving what the restaurant's name suggests, \"umami.\" I will not recommend this place, unless you're looking to only share saki with someone special in a romantic setting."}
{"text":"Walked by this spot and was curious. Checked it out and loved it. I was a little turned off by the reviews, but I like to give places a chance. The head chef, Jared knows what hes doing. Their ramen is good and well prepared. I hope the locals catch on, they've got something good in Downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"All of the hype is spot-on for this place and I can't wait to go back and try more!!

I would order a little differently next time as I think their sashimi and hand-rolls are a little overpriced based on my experience at other places around the city. The quality was great and I enjoyed the salmon sashimi and striped bass handroll we ordered, but I'd focus more on the Yatai menu next time since those options are a little more unique.

My boyfriend and I split an order of the Miso Ramen (with extra noodles) because we heard the portions were huge. And they are! The ramen had crispy chili, edamame, nori, scallions and mushrooms. We added two Nitamago, which are soy-marinated poached eggs that you absolutely must add. It was SO delicious. The broth was very hearty and the mix of flavors was addictive. We finished the whole bowl despite being full about half-way through.

With our food and two drinks each (2 beers, sake and some Japanese whiskey), our bill came to just under $90. If you are looking to keep it cheap, skip the drinks and you can totally get a reasonably priced and filling meal here."}
{"text":"First, they forgot I ordered ramen. Then I waited over an hour for ramen. Finally, it showed up, but by that point I just wanted to leave. Had to get it to go. They did apologize for it and did refund me for the ramen. For the establishment itself, the tables are too close together, the next table over had their kid banging their silverware on our table. That's how close it is. The TV volumes are too loud. You have to yell to hear the person sitting across the tiny table. The poor waitress for our table had her hands chapped up so bad it looked painful."}
{"text":"So I'm totally over this Pittsburgh trend of new restaurants that prioritize presentation over flavor.  My first experience with Umami left me underwhelmed.

Our party of 5 arrived on time for our 7:30 resy on a Friday night, and the restaurant was pretty packed.  In fact, we had to wait 15 minutes for our table, which ended up being in the \"traditional seating\" room.  The ambiance all around was pretty sick, from the sunken-in wood floor seating to the muraled windows and skylight.  Still some kinks to work out though--a large mounted fan provided ventilation for what would have otherwise been a super stuffy room, but also continuously blew around our napkins and the nori on our plates as we ate.  I guess they worked with what they have in this very limited space.

As for the service, we repeatedly worried that our server had forgotten about us, as we waited quite a while for our orders to be taken, and there were large gaps before we received our drinks and our meals--the food all came out at different times, and our meal ended with her intense struggle to split our check correctly.  Granted, it has to be super awkward to serve in that room--you kind of have to kneel down to be level with where we were sitting, but we were all left with the feeling that perhaps it was her first night on the job.

Our drinks did not disappoint.  The falling petal sake was beautifully floral without being overbearing, the black tea was served in a generous pot, and the beer was priced right.

Foodwise, my fiance and I ordered the SHIITAKE MUSHROOM and JAPANESE EGGPLANT ROBATAYAKI, the BRANZINO SASHIMI, and the TONKOTSU RAMEN.  I also tried to order the SHISHITO PEPPERS, but were told that they were out of season with no replacement.  Whomp, whomp.  

The robatayaki were pretty disappointing, with very little char from the grill and little flavor besides the hint of seasoning from the brushed-on tare, which was all goop and no taste.  I was expecting mushroom caps for the shiitakes as previous Yelp photos showed, but received sad little vertical slices of mushrooms instead...is this a cost cutting measure?  It certainly did not enhance taste or portion size.  

The ramen slightly redeemed the meal.  Admittedly, I'm very ramen-picky, but the broth has decent enough flavor but ironically was pretty one-noted...I believe I would diagnose that with a lack of umami. No complexity.  Still, it shouldn't be hard to make a great bowl of soup with the crap-ton of pork fat that is tonkotsu ramen is based on, so they met expectations in that respect.  My far less picky fiance was very pleased.

The big letdown, however, was the branzino.  I ordered it to satiate my curiosity, as I've never before had raw branzino.  And I know it's a mild fish, but this sashimi had zero. flavor.  I mean, there was a tiny kick from the same weak tare brushed on top, but the fish itself had not even a hint of taste, fishy or otherwise.  Also, it was chewy.  High quality sushi (unless it's something like squid or octopus or clam, obvi) should melt in your mouth.  This did not pass the test.  In awe of its absolute tastelessness, we passed this around the table to check if maybe my taste buds were out of order.  They weren't.  Sad--for the $8, we could have almost gotten another ramen bowl instead.  If I had to guess, perhaps they're still figuring out how to cure their sushi (yes, real, fresh sushi has to be cured before it's served--otherwise, it's tasteless).

The only feature of our food that was spot-on with what we experienced in Japan was the presentation.  Everything was artfully and tastefully plated, without being overdone.  And at the very least, unlike other \"trendy\" restaurants that have opened lately, Umami is not overpriced.  However, much like the restaurant space itself, it was a visually beautiful meal from start to finish but functionally, fell woefully short."}
{"text":"I bookmarked Umami while at previous location but never went and since they re-opened at new location, I've been looking forward to try here someday.

Parking is in the back but limited. Street meter parking is free on Sunday.

Located at Shady Park, they share space with two other restaurants. Dive bar will be appropriate word to describe their ambiance. They serve ice cold Japanese beer, they looked really good. Only if I came on lazy weekend, I would have tried their beer but I had too much things to do on that day.

Seat yourself here. Server came fairly quick and he was very friendly. No complaints to their service.

Ramen, spinach wasn't traditional ramen topping and pork belly I added was cut in a dice size. It made it easier to eat but I would have preferred larger size. Noodle was cooked perfectly. I added garlic paste and my soup tasted so good, or that's what I thought initially. Soup had nice umami taste to it, really enjoyed in the beginning.

For some reasons I started developing headache. Not sure why. Headache went away a few hours later as I kept drinking a lot of water. Broth got too salty about a half way into it. I've been on low sodium diet for a while, I thought my body became too sensitive to too much salt?  Not sure what it was as initially soup tasted very good."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place while searching for healthy lunch places after soccer game.  Not your typical strip mall restaurant - we had top notch food  with amazing service in a fabulous space.

There were great lunch options:  my husband and I had the sashimi bowl - super fresh, generous cuts with gorgeous presentation (see pic).  Loved the addition of pickled veggies which gave a satisfying crunch alternative to the fish and co trading briny flavor.

One son had Unagi Don Bowl - big portion of rice & eel which he said was the best dish he's ever had!

The other boy had a mixture of rolls -- all fantastic.  

Wish we were staying closer, would have gone bsbk for dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, unquestionably, the best ramen in town. Spicy tan tan, crack or fried chicken, soft egg, corn, and spicy garlic paste. The first sip of broth floors you. Please, please open another location in north Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Umami when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  While the restaurant gave a fun izakaya vibe, I thought some of the food items were lacking.  I recently visited (a whole year late) and had a better experience.

One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.

This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.  Now that I discovered some stand out items, it makes me want to revisit."}
{"text":"I had to give this place three stars because I wasn't as impressed as some of the other reviewers. The sushi was pretty good but the execution lacked creativity. All three of the rolls we ordered were placed on a plate with a dollop of sauce - nothing fancy to see here folks. 

I agree with one review here about the fish being cut too thick. The fish should be cut delicately thin, if you want to be authentic. 

The ambience could be so much better without the tvs. If I want to catch the game I can walk down to Buffalo Wild Wings! They're so out of place!!! Get rid of the tvs, paint some Japanese anime in their place and you have appropriate ambience. 

Finally, the service was slow even though the place was almost empty when we came here. We had to ask for ginger and wasabi, too."}
{"text":"The ramen expert in me wants to cringe when I eat the ramen. LOL But I also know that I'm not in Japan or California, and this is probably better than most ramen places in Tempe.

Well, it's better than Republic Ramen... if that is saying much? However, it's probably from the same people of Republic Ramen. The broth, the menu and the style is just too similar. And it's just as expensive. I ordered the ramen.... no toppings and it was $8. Additional toppings are at least $1 per topping, and that is ridiculous.

I don't know where these guys learned to make ramen but please.... no more spinach. It ruins the texture and flavor of the broth. I don't even want to ask why there is corn available as a topping. I'll just get annoyed. -______-

Better off going back to Cherry Blossoms for their ramen (which actually tastes like Japanese ramen)."}
{"text":"Love the ramen specials. I think they are cheaper than the regular ramen and still the same size. If you loved the ramen from the last Umami location, the flavor really hasn't changed. It was a little weird sitting in Shady Park though because all three restaurants shared the same servers, seating and menu.

I still say they can improve their broth, but if you are looking for late night ramen again on mill ave, then it is back! Enjoy."}
{"text":"We have been going to Sen of Japan for quite some time and thought we had found the best sushi in town... and then we decided to give Umami a try based on Yelp reviews. Not only were we NOT disappointed, but this is, by far, THE BEST SUSHI we've ever had. And not just in Las Vegas, but anywhere! The sushi is so fresh that it practically melts in your mouth. The pieces were so big and thick. The spicy salmon roll was not typical at all. The pieces of salmon were diced, almost like a Poke. And the Carson roll! Soft shell crab, scallop, tuna, avocado and cucumber with a giant piece of salmon on top. A must have! We went on Wednesday and going again tonight, 2 days later. Our server, Nina, was sweet and extremely efficient. 

And did I mention the price?? So reasonable it's crazy. If you love sushi, you owe it to yourself to try Umami. But wait, never mind, don't! I don't want to have to fight the crowds"}
{"text":"I'm still aquiring a taste for sushi but this place is definitely my favorite. You can choose to sit at a table or the sushi bar. Both times I visited we sat at the sushi bar and the chefs are right there to take your order and make it right in front of you. If you want recommendations from the sushi chef then this is a great choice. Service is quick, and fairly reasonably priced. The atmosphere is really cool. Definitely recommend for date night or going out with friends. Try the spicy tuna roll!"}
{"text":"As I climbed the stairs to the third floor, I feel like I was be transported to a very unique experience.  The decor is Asian and rustic. It has a verysexy vibe.  We sat at the sushi bar as we had not made a reservation.  We got to watch what was going on in the sushi bar and kitchen. This pace is no joke.  There was clearly a high level of attention being paid to everything that went out of ther kitchen. 
We got one of their sashimi bowls to share and their fish special.  This place seemed so authentic I was afraid to ask for American utensils but did not want miss out on the amazing roasted veggies on the fish dish. So fresh and flavorful. It was amazing. The presentation of the sashimi was on point. We enjoyed everything we ate. We also got an alcoholic and tea drink. Their drink menu is as unique and transformative as the rest of our experience.  Its pricey so don't come super thirsty but I recommend not skipping it.  
Service was friendly and adequate- not a stand out in the experience.   
No doubt, we'll be back"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out.  Tuna Poke was awesome! Tried a few new rolls wasn't exactly our taste.  We didn't complain, however, the server sensed it and notified the manager. The friendly manager came out and was pleasant and we gave feedback.  She was professional and comped the rolls we weren't satisfied with. Overall nice atmosphere and great service.  I rated as 5 stars because the other rolls, beef bowl and tuna poke were great."}
{"text":"I bought a livingsocial deal for Umami Kitchen after reading some of the reviews on opentable. I'm not sure why they are rated a 4.5 there because I was really not all that impressed especially by the prices. The restaurant is very very small. There are maybe 7 tables and can probably seat around 20 max. The atmosphere was a nice modern Asian decor. My guy and I went on a cold rainy October night and the restaurant was very warm and cozy which I liked. I had a cup of $4 Jasmine bloom tea which was actually very good.  
The menu selection was a bit disappointing. There are 5 Sushi/rolls dishes to choose from (as appetizers). 8 small plates choices and 7 large plate choices.
We started with the $9 Spicy BBQ Ribs from the small plate. It came with 4 ribs and some kimchi. It was delicious.
I picked the Udon noodles with spicy steak ($19) and my guy picked the Massaman Curry Chicken(19).  My Udon noodles was just maybe 1 min over cooked, the beef was not spicy and a little bit tough. The soup overall  was a bit flavor less and too salty especially when I got to the end. My guy said that the Curry chicken was good but he's definitely had a better $12 curry at a lot of other places with bigger portions. The chicken chunk was too large and a bit burnt. The curry flavor was a bit plain, almost missing something. 

The serves was attentive and the food came out quickly. Our bill came out to be $51 total. A bit much for the quality I would say!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here one morning for some breakfast ramen. Something, most ASU students will do, whether Maruchan, Top Ramen or Ramen Republic or some kind of blonde and thick horse hair. When we came here, the place had been barely open a week or so. 

Let me start off by stating that I parked far off. I wasn't sure if we could park in the lot next to the church right in front so rather than be towed away by most of the predatory tow companies that patrol Tempe and especially the ASU area like Nazis, I just parked in the lot next to Ztejas. Let me tell you, it was a brisk walk with me being a minature landwhale having more chin than a Chinese phone book at the time. I've since lost a disturbing amount of weight and look like a concentration camp survivor. I'm striving for that sexy middle ground, but I digress. 

We came in and the place was actually pretty nice. The bathrooms were super artsy and clean and Japanese garden looking. Nice I thought. Waitress, pretty good looking. We sat down and there was crayons in boxes of sand, further more drawing on the Japanese style decor, and drawing paper. I thought that was pretty cool too.

I looked at the menu. It's not as cheap as Ramen Republic or a $0.20 bag of top ramen, I'll tell ya that. The basic bowl of ramen was like $8. All the other toppings and stuff were $.025 to $2 more so or. I thought that was a gyp but it must be delicious to command such a price. We ordered. Now, since it was barely a week after opening day and I heard that they were giving away free ramen on that day, they were out of a bunch of ingredients so I had to maneuver through what little that they had left. 

The ramen came out pretty good. I just don't like the pricing especially when Ramen Republic is all inclusive as far as additives are and the prices for extras are just that...extra."}
{"text":"Holy Jesus Fuck this place is expensive!

We went for sushi. Its listed as a sushi bar, right? WOW... Nigiri is a little more than your \"t-shirt and jeans\" sushi bar, but you get ONE piece. Not two. Then, they only do hand rolls, no maki. 

Others seem to like it as a Japanese restaurant. We didn't have the cooked menu. 
The food was tasty, but if you really want sushi, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So glad to see Umami back in business! They now share space at Shady Park with two other businesses. As others have said, it's less Zen chill and more college hangout. I do miss the old ambiance, but I'm so happy to have the ramen back. My go-to is the vegan shio broth with togarashi, fish cake, spinach and soft-boiled egg. 

Side note: I do wish the restaurant would get their eggs right. A soft-boiled egg is supposed to have a SOFT (runny) yolk that oozes out when cut in half to enrich the broth. Even the soft eggs here have hard centers. It's disappointing but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"This place is good. Not many near our house this and this place has great prices too. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is beautiful. Garlic edamame is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm really going to miss this place. For the past 2 months that I've been working in PIT, Umami has been a staple order for me through Postmates - I love the freshness of the ingredients and the sheer deliciousness of everything. 

Umami can perhaps be called a more fusion-y take on japanese food, but not in a tasteless or odd way that fusion food often ends up. I haven't had a bad dish at Umami. though I will say their ramen is not amazing, so maybe order another one of their many amazing dishes on the menu instead. 

--Yaki udon - my fave dish. I could eat this everyday. Al dente udon noodles with a perfectly cooked onsen egg, dried mushrooms, chili powder, shaved beets, and lots of cabbage. This is the type of meat less fish I could eat all the time. The mix of tastes and ingredients made this comfort food. 
--Chawanmushi - only truly legitimate Japanese restaurants serve chawanmushi, and I was pleasantly surprised at this. It's served with thin slices of pumpkin and scallions on top, and is so smooth and not too salty. 
--Temaki - I loved the salmon or the unagi ones. The unagi here is heavier and saltier than the usual types, with thick sauce covering it. I appreciate how the seaweed is crisp and the servings of rice is generous. 
--Okonomoyaki - ive tried this at other teppanyaki places and it's a little different here - a little saltier especially with the bacon slices and mayo on top. But so delicious, and fried to a crisp at all the right parts. I loved the crunch of the cabbages in the pancake. 
--others like takoyaki, nigiri etc...they've all been really good. 

It can get pricey if you order the small dishes, so maybe that's why it's not 5 stars yet for me. 

The atmosphere is also modern, young, like a hip bar, with great happy hour specials. I recommend making a trip here in person, not just ordering it online!"}
{"text":"I really don't like restaurants where I leave wanting to swing through a drive-thru on my way home because I'm still hungry (Chris, I concur). Unfortunately, Umami is that kind of restaurant. 

I had soup and a noodle dish, which were decently flavored, but left me hungry. The food was okay, but certainly not mind-blowingly delicious. 

What a waste of money :(."}
{"text":"Warning: new owners, new menu. Don't come here if you are looking to experience the original ala carte menu.

Uuuuughhhhh wish I wasn't writing this review. I used to come here often when it was owned by the original owners and this place was amazing. They had an ala carte menu but honestly it was worth paying the price because the quality/presentation was soooo worth it.

Now that Umami has been bought out by the owners of Sakana (boooooo) they have completely changed the menu and are now an all you can eat sushi joint. So if you are looking for quality look else where, this place is all about quantity now.

First off, I haven't been a fan of Sakana. I hate the way they portion their nigiri with 90% fish and 10% rice. I was almost positive it was going to be the same at this newly managed Umami so I started off with a small order. 

-beef bowl
-chicken bowl
-seared salmon with lemon nigiri
-Japanese lasagna roll
-#1 roll chef makes

Umami originally had a beef bowl (gyuudon) so we were under the impression it was going to be the same delicious bowl, but when it came out we got a teriyaki beef bowl. The meat was SO chewy my mouth was getting tired after eating one piece. We ended up asking the server if we could switch it out for a chicken bowl because it was so hard to eat. They accommodated us and got rid of the beef bowl. The taste of the seared salmon with lemon was good, but I was right about the portions and couldn't eat the whole piece of nigiri. The lasagna roll was decent and so was the #1. Nothing special. 

The server we had was good and he was definitely handling a lot of tables as best as he could. When I got my bill he had still charged us for the beef bowl instead of the chicken, but he was so busy I didn't care to get it taken care of. It was a $1 difference. They gave me a 10% discount for showing my military ID.

I was definitely upset the whole dinner because I wasn't expecting the food to be that bad... but it was lol. I won't be coming back since I am not a fan of Sakana or Sushi Neko."}
{"text":"Best I have found in NW Las Vegas!  i was spoiled with San Fernando Valley sushi, and have been so disappointed with local faire.  Umami has great atmosphere, excellent quality and the sushi presentation is top notch! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"First impression...everything is very red.  But that's just the lighting.  Japanese bar food?  Okay...I'm in.  

Cool venue.  The tables are too close together to be a date night.  That seems to be a trend.  I don't like that trend.  

We went all over the menu.  Drinks, apps, a giant whole fish with its head still on, its cold dead eyes staring up at our drunken faces appetizingly.  It was good.  Don't get that though.  It was...problematic to pick around the bones with chopsticks.  

Loved our waitress.  Like...literally loved her.  It was hard to leave.  She hasn't called.  Great service, spoke some japanese even.  

Very laid back atmosphere.  Cool and new and fun and well done.  Sake selection was awesome.  

Ex-PEN-sive.  My sister took me for my birthday and my only hope is that she forgets how much it cost before her birthday in May."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Went with a party of 5 and had no problem getting seated. Decor is awesome and feels much higher end than a strip mall. My food was fantastic (short ribs) and rest of the group loved the sushi. I'm not a raw sushi fan but did love one of the cooked versions. Beautiful presentation and service was top notch. Dessert was fantastic which isn't always the case in sushi joints."}
{"text":"This place is very cool and trendy looking on the inside. Definitely nice ambiance for a date night. One complaint on the layout is that you will most likely be seated DIRECTLY NEXT TO another table. Like inches away. It's a little awkward. There is another room in the back with more traditional (floor) seating that I'd like to try. 

Our server was very friendly and had lots of recommendations (and patience) since it was our first time there. My date ordered the ginger ginger cocktail and I ordered the \"pure dawn\" sake. Both were good but the cocktail was pretty bitter - a good palate cleanser but definitely a sipping drink.

For an appetizer we ordered the grilled octopus balls based on recommendations from our server and other Yelp-ers. There were OK. I think it was mostly bread and they were very filling. If there was octopus in there I couldn't tell you. 

For the second course we shared the chirashi (a mix of sashimi with a quail egg and salmon roe). The fish was very fresh and it was enough to share. 

For the main course my date ordered the miso ramen and I got ramen with pork (can't find the name of this right now). Both were good; I think the miso ramen had a better broth. Also both were very filling! If you plan to order these as a main course I'd dial it back on the appetizers.

All in all it was a fun and relaxing experience. Plan on taking your time to try new things and eat slowly."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, excellent service, fresh sushi, nice presentation. I recommend the Full Moon and Number 5. We will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has such good ratings. The service and beer was good, but the food was a real disappointment.  The pork belly comes out as tiny cubes that are fatty and completely overcooked.  I didn't get my shoots either.  The broth and noodles were okay but the whole meal was overly salty. Try koi in Phoenix to see what the food SHOULD taste like.

I will say the atmosphere was chill and it looked like a fun place to enjoy a few beverages. Just skip the food."}
{"text":"The food, and the sake were very good. They urged me to set my prejudice aside and get Spam® with my ramen, and I'm happy I did. The prices were very reasonable as well. 

The front of the house needs some practice. For instance, they missed handing off our order smoothly when the servers switched, and our bento appetizers didn't arrive until after the ramen had arrived. Mind you, they did the right thing and comped the appetizers. I'm not complaining. But I think it would help if they brought in a good front of house person to help out what could otherwise be an outstanding restaurant. 

(We sat in the dining room-I observed at least two parties try to enter the place by way of a non-functioning door before they realized they needed to enter via the bar door. Maybe a little signage is in order?)

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We like this place a lot. There aren't too many ramen places to chose from in Arizona and although this may not be the most authentic ramen, it's still very good. The meats are seasoned well and the different soup broths are always very flavorful."}
{"text":"It was enjoyable. A little on the pricey side but I also don't frequent sushi joints to often so I'm not the most reliable source. 

The hostess was great! When we arrived without a reservation she put us on the waiting list and also told us the bar was first come, first serve. She walked by the bar to check out the anticipated wait and noticed if I couple moved down one seat we would be able to be seated right away. She kindly asked them and they obliged - so we got a spot at the bar within minutes of arriving! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. The ramen was good and the server was knowledgeable about the beers on tap. 
We came around 930pm and the service was timely and the food was good
Definitely will return! Thanks

Not the greatest food picture in the world but it's what I got..."}
{"text":"Great place. Really, on the strip worthy type place, yet close to home. It has changed hands a few times over the past few years, but somehow has always been great.

Food:
I'm vegan, so veggie rolls for me. Hubby is not vegan, but he loves this place more than I do. Very good food overall! Good rice to sushi ratio. They have a Wonder Woman roll that is fried shitake mushroom, cucumber, avocado inside and fish on top, but for extra $1 they modified it for me with avocado on top instead of fish (I'll try to attach a photo here). Beautiful and so delicious!
Mini udon is vegan friendly. They also have skewers - mushroom, tofu. A few other items like edamame and seaweed salad for my vegan/vegetarian friends. I'm trying to encourage them to get a little vegan menu. ;) I'll be here way more often then!

Presentation:
On point! Sharp, clean and elegant. Definitely gets the tastebuds going. 

Vibe:
Modern, dark colors, Japanese fusion with a sports bar. Really cool looking mural on one of the walls. A couple of booths, tables and of course sushi bar. 

Service:
Very friendly and accomodative staff. Didn't mind at all to check on preparation of certain foods for me. Very pleasant. Always served us very quickly."}
{"text":"The Ramen was delicious. Made from fresh ingredients with a slow cooked stocked. There were a few problems I encountered. I was greatly disappointed by the false advertising of their sumo challenge. I was promised a free meal a week upon completion. Look for my name on the wall and you will see it posted as the champion. However, when attempting to receive my prize I was told it was a \"joke\". I will be hesitant to give them business again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the miso broth with roasted chicken and spicy corn.  I think it would have been more enjoyable if I could have eaten it with a fork. I have too little patience to try to eat a bowl of noodles with a spoon and a pair of chopsticks lol. This place is hard to find but if you just walk around the building you will run into it."}
{"text":"Great sushi thanks to Ray! Super welcoming vibes here. Everyone was so kind. Still haven't finished our dinner but I had to write a review while I had a moment! Can't stop ordering the \" Red Bull\" roll! Thanks everyone! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate there.  I ordered the miso ramen with chicken, corn and garlic paste.   I was expecting it to taste a lot better.  Our opinions were that the broth itself was a bit salty.  Also, the noodles weren't fully cooked and the soup was warm."}
{"text":"I have been twice now and each time it just gets better and better.  I love their garlic edamame and their seaweed salad, so delicious!  But the kicker is their Paitan Ramen OH MY GAWD!!!  The broth is rich and beautiful and just has amazing flavor and the noodles are perfectly cooked with a little but of bite and combined with the vegetables and oh you have to add a tea egg - perfection in a bowl! triple yum"}
{"text":"Oh man, no more lobster ramen. There is no more ramen at all.  They've switched their menu to be an all you can eat place now. Everyone is asking about the ramen and I did as well today. They're just switching things up. I'm just a little sad about it.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I generally have a fairly even stance on sushi: because it is expensive it should be pretty damn good. We came in yesterday and were happy to see that we walked in right before a long line of people. We were told that we shouldn't be longer than 30 minutes, which is as understandable for a party of 6. We ended up being the last group to be seated, waiting for over an hour. The party ahead of us had paid and left prior to us getting a table. When we did sit, the wait staff rarely checked on us. We acknowledged that we tried to wave down a server for a full 20 minutes (someone had to yell \"excuse me\" to get a waitress' attention), the waitress didn't apologize but said \"I don't know who your server is\" and began to give us attitude, slamming our glasses on the table as she filled them. This was all pretty disappointing because the food was excellent, with thoughtful presentation. The ambiance seemed also seemed amazing, with nice art pieces on the walls, but we were unlucky again as the air vent was blowing directly onto us and the speaker above us played rock so loudly we couldn't really hear each other speak."}
{"text":"Why you should come here: 
Cause you hungry for some solid Japanese food, and Umami's got it!


Where's it located? 
Same area as Buffalo Wild Wings/Zaba's


What you should order:
Depends what you're feeling...pretty wide variety here, from sushi to Ramen and even hot entrees too...

We started off with some Wasabi Tako and Amberjack Yuzu Truffle which was very tasty. We also split the Lobster Ramen which had spiny lobster tail, shrimp, scallop, mussel, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms and scallions and a very generous portion of noodles. 
Great flavors, but be prepared for some heat as it is in a spicy seafood broth.

You can't come here and not order sushi??? Wifey got an Avocado Roll, I had to have my Uni, and we got the Ocean Trout off the specials board...we were undecided on a roll on the  menu, so Chef Kim offered to make us a special no-name roll which had soft shell crab and shrimp tempura inside, wrapped in soy paper,  and topped with salmon and hamachi. All sushi tasted very good, generous cuts, and we were stuffed!

There's an Entree section that offers stuff like Chilean Sea Bass, Korean Shortribs, and  Hanger Steak if you're not feeling the raw stuff.

We got their popular Strawberry Champagne Cake and an Affogato to share. Cake was like boxed mix and I didn't taste any champagne,  but it was made with real buttercream. Good first visit,  and thank goodness for this place, because there's very slim pickings for sushi up here in the hills! Just be prepared to pay more than all you can eat prices because everything here is a la carte...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"This place is so yummy! The vegan ramen is amazing. If you are vegan, you will not be disappointed. It is very hard to find vegan ramen so I was thrilled to find this place."}
{"text":"I should start my review by saying that being a vegetarian might not be fair to review this restaurant but in any case for fellow vegetarians, I was somewhat disappointed by lack of flavors in the food. The food lacked umami flavor! :-) service was nice and friendly and I had a very good sake. 
Another problem with the place was cleaning material with strong chemical odor which was being used constantly as we ate which is really not all that pleasant.  Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"A great meal of sushi and great typical Japanese style dinner combos in NLV. Went here tonight for the first time and having never been here previously when it was a different owner. Offers a 10% military discount too. 

The atmosphere was trendy and spare, with paintings on the walls and in the bathrooms and lots of wood and black, and funnily enough a good amount of upbeat K Pop style music and christmas songs. Great spot for large or small parties of adults for happy hour! Try the pear sake!

Impressed with the level of professionalism given by the new management/owner, who came to my table to discuss when I politely explained that the spicy miso ramen dish I'd ordered was not to my taste. 

He wanted to ask why out of curiosity. I've had it before in other places many times before moving to Vegas and I had nothing to hide since I barely ate any of it. Sometimes the taste just isn't what you expect! And he understood but was concerned.

 I felt very well taken care of, he even offered to comp my next ramen, which I said was totally unnecessary. I enjoy giving my business to a good place if they treat me well, once I find what I love to eat, and Umami has MANY options. 

The new management has similar offerings throughout Vegas in four other restaurants that offer AYCE options, which includes standard nigiri and baked/fried/hand rolls. Crab, lobster, tuna, avocado, cream cheese, ponzu, yum yum and SOS sauce seems to be the go-to on many rolls. I can't hate on it because it works. 

I've been frequenting one of the other \"partner\" restaurants, Sakana, a lot recently and having LOVED their options but hated the far drive, finding this place made me happy. The menus are similar and prices, but small differences in presentation and style. 

Our waiter, a young Asian man took a while to greet and seat us but when we finally sat five mins after entering what looked to be a nearly empty restaurant we saw that there were only two servers on the floor and a party of 12 on the far side, hidden from the front, and a few others. Also, the entire time our server was not only serving them but also preparing various to-go boxes. Poor guy probably prepped like 5-6 just in the time we were there, maybe for phone orders. He was as attentive as he could be, responding quickly to us and getting help from the other server and food runner. 

The rolls we ordered were great, dinner combo worthwhile though I wasn't a fan of the very acidic vinaigrette on the salad that came with the combo. I like mine genuine Japanese style with sesame oil. I ordered one to go as well. Overall, would come back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"First time eating at umami (inside shady park) and we had a awesome experience. Ramen was really good, service was great and so were the prices. Decor is old school 80's bar but it isn't trying too hard. We will be back to shady park to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I would leave one star for the horrible food but this place gets an extra star for being clean and fairly friendly.

The food is terrible. The ramen had the texture and taste of something I could microwave at home. It was awful.

The shoyu broth tasted like salt and nothing else. It had absolutely no flavor. It was nothing short of disgusting.

Finally, I ordered extra noodles with my ramen, and unlike every other place in the world, this just means Umami just crams some more noodles into the bowl rather than bringing more noodles over part way through the meal. That was pretty lame.

This place is terrible. The food is highly overpriced considering how poor the quality is. Really I feel like I paid someone to poor hot water into a bowl of top ramen. Yuck! Never again."}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and very attentive. 
We had the Red Bull , Carson,  Spicy Scallop (meh), Rock and Roll( different than you've had before) it was beautiful and very refreshing. 
We did have the baked mussels, as there were 2 reviews they were good.. I would not order them again , were not good. Very reasonable pricing and close to home. We will be going back"}
{"text":"Like others, I have to say this place is delightful but a tad on the expensive side without a coupon.  However, it fits the locale being that they bring all of their fresh food from within 100 miles of Chagrin.  I'm not as into 'organics' as most people, but the freshness of the sushi we ordered was absolutely amazing.  Not your average sushi rolls, and the pan seared Tuna sushi was better than I've tried anywhere else.  I believe that was served on top of a bed of apple-relish with a delicious glaze.  

Their drinks were a bit overpriced, but the waitress was exceptionally attentive with a delightful Aussie (?) accent, and even the Sprite comes with a lemon AND lime garnish.  

Im a Miso Soup connoisseur, and theirs was just average... The coconut squash soup was different and just right though.  

The establishment was very cozy, and 'intimate' as others have said... But that just means you get more attention and don't have to worry about too much noise.  

Overall a nice place, but it would be nice if they were a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Wow, Umami really delivers on several levels. Umami is another fantastic addition to the Pittsburgh food scence in terms of Japanese goodness. The entrance was a bit hard to find as it is not well advertised, but it's located basically on top of Round Corner Cantina. The place is always packed and in summer time it's getting HOT in there, so be prepared! All the staff was amazing, friendly and very attentive. We had the Nagi Shigiyaki, which is a fried eggplant on ground chicken and it was amazing! We also had the pork gyoza, sushi and a couple of other items. I also had a cocktail to deal with the heat and to accompany my meals and it was delicious! Umami is a bit on the pricier side, but in my opinion well worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love coming here, the atmosphere is wonderful, the food is amazing and we've always had awesome service. Liz has waited on us multiple times and we always enjoy having her recommend different menu items and she is always knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Listen, it's gorgeous decor, great location, and good food. The server was unversed in miso soup at a place called Umami, but whatev. Maybe he was new. Who knows. 

My problem is that I ordered DUMPLINGS and they were trying to tell me how nice the gnocchi was that came out; it was slightly burnt but otherwise well made. When I ask for dumplings, I want a pan-fried pocketful o' Asian goodness. Not Italian knots of wood (which is what gnocchi)."}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi restaurant with style.  June the owner is amazing host!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing ambiance. We will be loyal customers after just one visit! Ask for Mike! Impeccable service."}
{"text":"Umami really is a special place with unexpected food in a very unique setting. The menu is sophisticated with ingredients and combinations not often found on Cleveland menus. Highly recommend this restaurant for a night out with friends that truly enjoy wonderful food!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was told that they don't have ramen between 3-5pm..I quickly yelped the place and didn't get warned that they won't have ramen between those hours. I was quite disappointed because I really wanted to try it out. Came back the day at the ramen hours and no wait -- which is fantastic. It's a self-seat kind of setting so we sat on a table. It took the waitress 10 minutes to good us our menus. I ordered the spicy tan tan noodle with a soft egg, fried chicken, and roasted pork. My husband ordered spicy tan tan noodle with a soft egg, hard egg, and pork belly. I believe we waited a good 40 minutes then our food came..it wasn't even crowded..I don't know why it took that long. But good thing I wasn't starving at the time or else I would have been super cranky and the rating would be lower. 

The food came and to my surprise, my roasted pork was actually shredded pork..interesting. It tasted fine (pork is always good) but I was just surprised. I tried my husbands pork belly and that was wayyyyyy too fatty to consume. I felt like I was going to get a heart attack haha. The fried chicken was ok. The broth was ok, too. Definitely not spicy (which I was hoping for). And the bill came out to be $30.

Overall good was ok. Money? $30 isn't much but I can go to Tampopo and grab two satisfying bowls of ramen for just $20. I definitely like Tampopo better."}
{"text":"I know it's not the best ramen on the planet, but by Tempe standards it's not so bad. The make-your-own ramen is pretty expensive--$8 for plain and extra for add-ons, but there's a separate menu where you can pick ramen where you don't choose the individual ingredients for $6! I always get this option. The service is nice. My favorite thing about Umami, though, is the location and atmosphere. It's a short walk from ASU but not on Mill, the building looks really pretty and feels like an old house that's been converted. A great place to get together with a few friends after classes and chat."}
{"text":"OMG.... AMAZING! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! My family and I love sushi. We just recently moved from Hawaii and was craving for some sushi. First placed popped up was this place. I am glad we found this place. The food is good and the staff are very friendly. Our server was NINA and she is absolute the best. GREAT SERVICE And made us feel like home. My husband and I will be back but this time it'll be just the two of us!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite of mine. Really good alternative if you are looking for something different than Pho. The soup is salty and simple. No frills ramen with big flavor. I recommend the Mr Roboto that includes soup, beer and saki."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Had a great time there and felt like the staff appreciated us being there."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great Ramen, reasonably priced, you have to visit this place, you'll be hooked after the first visit!"}
{"text":"It was decent. High prices for a small meal and the sodas were given in cans (maybe just a pet peeve of mine, but restaurants really should serve sodas out of machines and not out of cans). The meal was good but the environment, to me, was really uncomfortable. I unfortunately don't think I'll revisit this place."}
{"text":"Indifferent personnel.  We had a reservation, but the hostesses tried to seat us in an uncomfortable, crowded area although there were 3 other tables available.  We left without staying and will not return.  There are many other places which are accommodating and don't take business for granted."}
{"text":"Very awesome Ambiance!! Food was great. I highly suggest the potstickers they were great. The staff is super friendly !"}
{"text":"This hip japanese noodle / Ramen house is off the beaten path bear Mill Avenue and hard to find.  When you do find it, you will be happy.

You fill out a subway style menu choosing your broth, then add additional toppings such as soft egg, garlic, corn, etc.  

They have a decent Sake selection including unfiltered.  Service is actually really attentive. The ambiance is definitely casual and mellow.   If you sit in the center zone, they are often playing old Japanese marital arts  movies."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is very attentative and polite.  I reallly liked the wood decor and the modern way the restaurant is designed. The food was very good. The 1.99 handrolls are large and worth way more. I got the sushi lunchbox and that was tasty as well.  The dressing has a bit of hot spice that was just ok.  The main reason i am giving 4 stars is that the music was really loud especially for a lunch crowd. It made it hard to talk to the other people at the table. In the restrooms it was twice as loud.  Five stars if they can turn it down a bit."}
{"text":"I'm very satisfied with this restaurant..Very good sushi variety,good portion quality..and good presentation..Service is also very good..Over all good atmosphere.
Another big plus is that ayca sushi comes with a bonus of free hot/cold sake..all you can drink..Awsome!
Keep up the good work you guys..
I've been to many sushi restaurants and now I don't mind driving 18miles just to get there.."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It was a little hard to find. If I hadn't read the other reviews we wouldn't have known to keep going up the steps. But upon walking in, you're transformed to an izakaya in Japan! 

The takoyaki was by far the best thing we had and would highly recommend trying them! The shumai and gyoza were also a huge hit with our group. I wasn't thrilled with the tonkatsu ramen personally but others enjoyed it. 

This is a hidden gem well worth finding!"}
{"text":"Consistently fantastic - love it! Reasonable prices, a really fantastic ambiance, and overall great food makes Umami the restaurant I take family and friends to when they visit Pittsburgh. 
Definitely make a reservation - it can really fill up - or, go right when it opens. Making a reservation and going on a weekend night, with the neon lighting up the windows and a dj behind the bar, is an experience in itself. 

I've had better drinks at other nearby places, but the food is definitely worth a trip. Go during happy hour to try some of the drinks, and to get some great small plates."}
{"text":"To all ramen enthusiasts: if you're looking for the real deal, this place doesn't have it. 

If you never had real ramen (like the reviewer below) and are just comparing to store-bought cup noodles, then yes, of course this is better; it is also 20x the cost of your cup noodle!!

I ordered a bowl of miso ramen with roast pork and corn. Although ramen is usually salty, this bowl was overly salty and lacked that richness usually found in the broth. The roast pork was shredded and served ice-cold (literally) on top of the ramen, which made the whole bowl lukewarm; they had to warm up my friend's charshu pork, because it was also cold. Even though it was a hot day, I would have preferred my ramen to be hot like it's supposed to be! The actual noodles were just mediocre.

I see this as more of a fast-food-type place for the local college students.

Will I be back? Likely not."}
{"text":"Well, this used to be our favorite sushi restaurant. The best that I can figure, they sold the restaurant. I can't say how disappointed we were with the change. It used to be such good quality and service that we wouldn't bat an eye about paying at least a $100 for 2 people. So we figured we would give it a chance but were hesitant because of the \"all you can eat\" option, which is never a good sign. Now we're still paying the price 3 hours later. well the search for a new sushi restaurant begins. Such a bummer!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've found after searching through Phoenix, San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton, LA, and beyond. Umami ramen has this dish on lock down. Don't miss it. Get the extra noodles. Order the pork belly crispy. Extra egg is a must. I always get the spicy tan tan men, but the veggie ramen is delish too!  I might just return to Phoenix just for a bowl."}
{"text":"This place is great! I got the baked salmon and miso soup. They did not disappoint! Great service, good food, amazing atmosphere, will definitely be coming back when I get a sushi craving! 

Update: 17-Sep-17 this place is still amazing!!! It is my go-to spot for sushi now! I come here at least once every few weeks because I crave the garlic edamame. SOOOO good!"}
{"text":"Good value, decent food. I've had better in California, but this wasn't bad for AZ. Its a college town area, clients was pretty much mostly students. Service wasn't the best, but it was friendly and passable."}
{"text":"First timers here!!! We were looking for a great AYCE sushi place on this side of town, and we chose the BEST place!!! Located off 215/Durango their staff is super nice and attentive and FOOD is sushi grade!!!!! Check them out!!!!!!

Thanks Vanessa for your customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place has never been a good place to go. I was excited to see that they had started all you can eat. So, I gave it another try. The food is ok but when you order, you do not get what you had ordered and it takes them forever to get it with the house almost empty. Just go to krazy sushi Down the street."}
{"text":"First time experience of Umami it was amazing! Six months later I come back to Las Vegas and it turns out to have new owners and now there is an all you can eat sushi option. Gross. There is no need for ANOTHER  low-quality all you can eat sushi place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"By far the best Sushi restaurant I've ever eaten at. My daughter was very inexperienced with Sushi and after a meal here she loves it. My favorite is the Caterpillar and I like to have a bottle of the unfiltered Kizaguri Nigori Saki with my meal."}
{"text":"The ramen was very good, and I liked that there were 3 ways to prepare the broth- soy, sea salt, or miso style. I got the soy and it was very tasty. There is a slip you fill out to order, so it is easily customizable to suit your fancy. Try the pear saki, very good! I loved the chalk board wall by the bathroom, fun to pass time while you wait. Also the up and coming private/quiet room looks nice for studying over lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Umami since they were in the Brickyard, but I was seeing a show at Gammage so I thought why not. 

I got their Ramen and decided to add the fried chicken. Big mistake. The chicken tasted like it was friend an hour ago. Barely warm and not good. The rest of the Ramen was solid tho. 

The location is very open. Had to sit inside with the fans to cool off a little. 

I'll try them again, but stay away from the fried chicken addition to their Ramen. They have a lot more options as well (small plates and sushi) if you are in the mood for that as well."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the service was great but the vegan broth was WAY too salty. Flavor and portion size was good but couldn't get past the excessive sodium."}
{"text":"It was good! Im not going to say its the best sushi ive ever had. When we got there it was pretty packed, yet they still sat us down right away. The hostess and the server were SO nice, and helpful picking out sushis. Will definitely be returning cause the menu was really big."}
{"text":"Tried this little restaurant while on a day trip to Chagrin Falls.  Mushroom appetizer was pretty good, but the sushi was not at all appetizing.  It was mushy, and the crab was very fishy tasting, similar to canned.  We could not finish it.  Fortunately our waiter was very apologetic and did not charge us for it.  I Would not go again."}
{"text":"I am so happy to of found this place!!! I love Sakana but it's such a far drive from my house I hardly ever make it there. I tell my friend I wish they would open one on this side of town then we get there and Sakana, amongst other businesses, are listed at the bottom!!!! 

AYCE w/ONE DOLLAR HOT SAKE! 
Lunch-$21.95     Dinner-$26.95 


The service was the main reason I didn't give this one 5 stars. It took us a while to be helped and the women who greeted us made no effort to help out. 

The most important thing to me is the freshness of the fish and I thought everything was good!!

I love when places like this one offer 1/2 rolls as part of AYCE. 

All the nigiri and rolls hit the spot. I loved the garlic tuna and salmon the best. Along with burning my ass roll, No.1 chef master roll, and the KFC/gyoza apps
I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy there's a decent sushi/ramen place in Centennial Hills. Umami is just up the street from our house, which is AWESOME! My husband and I love this place! We came here on a Thursday night. When you first walk in, you'll notice the dark, sheek decor. The lighting was dim for dinner time. We were greeted by a waitress who seated us right away! You can choose to sit at a table in the dining room or at the bar to watch the sushi chef's make delicious creations. 

FOOD 

If I could rate this place based only on the food, I would give it 5-stars. Every dish was delicious! We ordered: 

1. Wasabi Octopus: Raw octopus w/ a wasabi sauce on top. It'll clear your nostrils as you chew on the tender octopus. 

2. Toro Nigiri Special: MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! Get it. It's a special that you'll have to ask your server about. 

3. Applejack Nigiri Special: I've never tried the applejack fish before (I also hope to God I heard the lady right when she recommended it). The nigiri came with a sort of ponzu sauce w/ jalapeno's on top. I loved this dish! 

4. Tiger Roll: The rolls at Umami are well-balanced that is not rice heavy. It's a simple tiger roll that tasted good since the fish is clearly fresh and the technique used held the entire roll together w/o breaking. 

5. Lobster Ramen: The highlight of our meal was the lobster ramen. However, it is spicy!!! This bowl is huge. It's perfect to share. The ramen came w/ a generous serving of noodles, soup, a huge lobster tail, mussels and mushrooms. I recommend ordering this, especially for those who love their Ramen extra spicy. The ramen noodles I've had better elsewhere, but it's still good. 

6. Strawberry Champagne Cake: The cake is light, fluffy and semi-sweet. Get this as a dessert to end your meal on a sweet note. 

PRICE 

Our meal w/ tip was $100 for two people. Umami does not offer an AYCE (All You Can Eat) option. Everything is a la carte. The quality of the food and the generous portion of the Lobster Ramen made it worth the price. I recommend coming here for a special occasion since it is a lot pricier than other sushi restaurants. 

SERVICE 

The service is the primary reason why I knocked this review down from a 5-star to a 4-star. The service started off great, but they didn't staff properly so when it became busy our waitress forgot about us. We sat there waiting for our check for a good 15 mins before our waitress noticed we didn't get our check yet. Sadly, this is a common issue with new restaurants that cut costs by understaffing. I think as they become more popular it shouldn't be as big of an issue and they'll have a higher budget to staff properly. 

Overall, my husband and I loved the food at Umami. The service could be improved. If you come here, be prepared to spend money since it is higher end. The quality of the food, the taste and preparation makes it worth it! 

Happy Dining,

{"text":"Overall score: 3.5/5

- ambience: 4/5
- food: 3.5/5
- service: good

We came to Umami on a Friday night, around 9:30pm, for late supper and drinks. The service was prompt and attentive, and the interior was tastefully decorated with an modern feel. There was a sushi bar as well as individual small tables scattered around the periphery of the restaurant. The food was a hit-or-miss, hence the 3.5 overall rating. We ordered:

- Salmon Handroll: my favorite dish of the night. A single hand roll with a generous portion of salmon and salmon eggs. It came with a pipette of soy sauce.
- Spicy Tuna Onigiri: my other favorite dish of the night. It was rather small, and also came with a pipette of soy sauce.
- Karaage (fried chicken): I had high hopes but it didn't cut it. The texture of the fried chicken was good; however, the flavor was unidimensional and didn't have much flavor apart from being salty. It came with a tonkotsu gravy which was okay.
- Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles (to share): my least favorite dish of the night. The noodles were bland, and the broth lacked richness and dimensionality.
- Panda Panda Panda drink: I liked the drink. It was very fruity, and came in a interesting fish-shaped vessel. Not too strong.

I'll probably come back to Umami and only stick to the sushi dishes the next time I'm there. It seems like a good late-night spot."}
{"text":"We'll chalk it up to a rough opening, being their first weekend and all...but while the food was ok, the service was not. 

We'll go back when they get their kinks sorted out. In the meantime it's teppanyaki in Shadyside or ramen in Squirrel Hill. 

Drinks were so, so. They sounded and looked neat but were too one-note and watery. 

The best thing was the takoyaki. Compared to the two other places I've had takoyaki in Pittsburgh they were actually better here. 

Again, hopefully the service gets better, the food had potential."}
{"text":"Excellent take out food..loved teriyaki beef and chicken. Miso soup was very tasty and good.  I will go again."}
{"text":"This is not your average Japanese restaurant, so plan accordingly! This restaurant is on the third floor above Cantina in Lawrenceville and has an over the top, club-like ambiance. I have never eaten in the sunken booth dining room, only the high-top table and bar side and it is lots of fun! Usually, in the evening there is a DJ and fun drinks abound. Make sure to make a reservation!

There is a sushi chef but you should not think of sushi as the main event. The fish seems very fresh here, so don't play it safe! Get things like the whole grilled fish or octopus balls. I imagine you only order food you are familiar with and you might be \"underwhelmed\" as some of the other reviewers mentioned. Don't fall into that trap! There is much to be enjoyed here! Great addition to the neighborhood and Pittsburgh's growing food scene."}
{"text":"Outstanding visit last weekend. Group of 5. We were seated with a smile and the service just kept getting better. We had appetizers (sushi, goat cheese dumplings) and they were excellent. For the main course I got the Udon noodles with steak. Very good. Everyone else loved their food as well. Nice quiet atmosphere and again, OUTSTANDING staff. Highly suggest you try this place. It is now amongst my favorites."}
{"text":"The spicy lobster ramen was delicious! Great flavor, lots of seafood (scallop, shrimp, mussels, and of course lobster tail), and bamboo, mushrooms, seaweed, egg. Everything I needed today! So glad it's close to home, not many ramen places in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Always looking to support a new local business...been waiting to see what this place would offer for some time...sadly I could have waited a little longer. 

I ordered the tonkotus Ramen w/ mini roll app, sushi salad and karaagi chicken.

Sushi salad...3oz fish and 1lb. of lettuce..no thank you

Karaagi was good....but..shouldn't the appetizer come before the ramen?...which is overloaded with shaved garlic...sad to say...only Ramen I've never finished...

The sushi is A La Carte....the roll was ok...rice was good in the roll...though...price point on the rolls was high....I see this place becoming another AYCE within 4 months"}
{"text":"Delicious beautifully displayed matcha cheesecake a bit small for $12. Feels like you walk up 2 flights right into Japan. Will have to return for the food."}
{"text":"Tried this last night with my husband for a date night. Loved the artwork and deco inside. The food was amazing! Everything I tried I loved. My favorite was the screaming o with seared tuna! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Umami is my regular place for its quality and price. But i always get a feel like staffs are not happy to work here. I've been here at least 7~8 times in last 3 months and I've never seen a single server or sushi chef smiling at customers. Their service was lacking, sometimes when they get busy servers become ignorant, (dropping dish to tables and be gone, they don't take dirty dish out or take new order, not even looking at customers). And chefs are rolling with angry face lol. I guess that's because they are too busy and everyone is tired. But everything else is good. Just a slight service improvement will raise my review to five stars!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! A sushi spot that I love on my side of town! The place has a modern atmosphere. Very inviting and well maintained. Staff was welcoming and accommodating. First thing I ordered was the lobster sushi. It only came with two pieces but it was worth it! I also had the baked green mussels. We tried two special rolls. One was the Carson roll which had soft shell crab, scallops, tuna, salmon, avocado and cucumber (so good)! The other roll was the Red Bull roll which had the soft shell crab, spicy crab, escolar, avocado, jalapeño and cucumber (my personal fave). Overall very good! Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a local sushi place and they can count me in as a regular!!! EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Went here with my roommate to try the noodles and was more than satisfied with the flavors. I liked the arrangement of side dishes they provide you. I was initially confused by the service. My roommate and I were seated  but no waiter had introduced themselves to us to tell us they would be serving us, so I went to the front and they started serving us immediately (no wait)."}
{"text":"I was well familiar with the outstanding ramen at Umami's previous location, but I am much happier that there is a ramen shop even closer to ASU and I don't have to travel a long distance! The service was fast and the woman serving me was polite. I ordered the shio ramen with pork, extra noodles, butter, and spicy garlic paste, and it tasted like my mouth had a taste of heaven. I only wish the gyoza was less hot (thermally), I burned the inside of my mouth biting into it and an option to sweeten the iced tea I ordered. I felt the prices were lower than the previous location, because the final price was $20.81, but then again, I probably did not order as much. I will be frequenting this location."}
{"text":"The friendly knowledgable staff is super cool here! Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations. Say what you will ...this is the best place for ramen in Phoenix ...and would be a solid place for ramen anywhere :)"}
{"text":"Fun spot, interesting atmosphere. Enjoyed the food, it was good quality & tasty, though our service was a little lacking. The parking wasn't the best, but doable. If I found myself near this restaurant in the future I would definitely stop again."}
{"text":"The long narrow staircase, vibrant wallpaper, neon signs, and intimate third floor space make Umami feel unlike any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. We arrived right at our reservation time and were seated immediately. Since this was our first time at Umami, our excellent server, Elizabeth, explained the izakaya style in which the food is served. The food is prepared pretty quickly, so you place multiple orders rather than ordering everything at once. Elizabeth and others checked on us frequently to ask if we needed anything.

The menu obviously sets Umami apart as well. My table ordered skewers (chicken thigh, pork belly, chicken heart, and chicken skin), hand rolls (yellowtail and mackerel), ramen, and yatai (fried chicken, octopus balls, and eggplant with ground chicken). Everything was delicious except for the ramen, which we all agreed lacked flavor, even with the chili sauce. Next time I'll just stick with the yatai dishes, which were small plates of fried Japanese-style street food.

There's a lot of great options to try at Umami, so my advice would be to bypass the ramen and sushi, which you get elsewhere, and stick with the unique and memorable flavors of the fried street foods!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food was great. People are extremely nice and the service was impeccable. Sushi was fresh and all the rolls tasted delicious. I recommend the number 5."}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi here was simply great, not to mention the service, cleanliness, ambiance, and price. We complimented the chefs, one of whom was the owner working so graciously behind the counter diligently making rolls and fulfilling other orders. I told him the 4.5 star YELP rating was well deserved and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Mediocre and hella overpriced ramen. I'm used to ramen places in San Francisco and Orange County. This tastes like it was made with packaged products"}
{"text":"Went to Umami recently... it was my 3rd trip there in the last 2 months. Each time I have gone my family and other families we are with really enjoyed it.  They have great lunch and dinner specials and the staff is fantastic.  The other night when we were there a lady was trying to do the All You Can Eat and feed all of her kids on the 1 ticket. Umami management told her that she couldn't do that, she blew a gasket and left.  The Umami manager came over and explained the situation to us since we were sitting close. He didn't have to do that because we already understood and felt Umami was right.  Later he comp'd us a few generous items. YEAH!!  Anyway, Umami food and sushi is great, I love the atmosphere and it is now my regular sushi place!  Cheers to Umami!"}
{"text":"YES it is finally cold enough for warm comfort soup!!! My friend and I are from California. We wanted to celebrate finishing an exam and we thought Umami was worth the drive out to Phoenix. We set our standards low though...

The Parking: Woah, I did not expect to not find parking on a monday night. But we luckily found a spot at a meter near by. Meters are FREE after 6pm! Umami's sign is small and a little tucked away so you just have to walk around the 21 Building in a circle and you'll eventually find it hahaha

The Feel: very modern, very trendy, definitely reminds me of any typical LA eatery. BIG THUMBS UP! You can use pencils to write on the cups at the table, or use chalk to write on the big wall across the bathrooms. 

The Service: great! Our water were filled promptly, our orders were taken right away (which was awesome because we arrived at 6:55 and happy hour ends at 7pm HAHAHA)

The Food: Happy hour items only

-paitan/miso broth with chasiu aka pork belly meat ($6): what a steal!!! I added a soft boiled egg and garlic. The broth was flavorful, a little bit on the salty side but nbd. The soft-boiled egg was a weeny bit too cooked. BUT the chasiu meat, oh baby, the chasiu meat. It was soft, tender... The sort of heavenly goodness that just melts in your mouth. ORDER THIS, you'll thank me later.

-sunset cocktail ($5) so delicious, it was perfectly fruity with a hint of alchy. Recommend for all the fruity drinks lovers.

The Con: the menu are paper and had lots of water and food stains on it, kinda gross. And the menu where you fill up your choice of ramen and additives were also reused, they just erased the previous order. I think there might be classier ways to be green and reuse your menu guys, like using lamination and use erasable markers...


Overall: our bill came out to be about $32 with 2 ramens and 2 drinks. Not bad at all! Umami is in the perfect location where you can take a walk down Mills road to work out some of that pork belly fat you just ate, or not, let it sit and marinate happily in your belly. Hahah, Umami, I'll be back for more@"}
{"text":"Umami is definitely an experience you have to try on a night out in Pittsburgh!!

While you have to climb two steep flights of stairs, you won't be disappointed with the food and experience that awaits you!

Umami's hours make it a great late night adventure with friends. During my last visit, a friend and I  were craving some good ramen, and decided to venture to Umami around 11pm. Upon arrival, we were seated by the grill, which is something a highly recommend to people! Watching the chefs cook the beautiful dishes in front of you definitely adds to your dining experience.

My friend I shared the ramen and takoyaki, and both were delicious!! The takoyaki was piping hot and it was fun to watch the bonito flakes \"dance\" from the heat. The ramen was clean and not too salty and a perfect size for sharing (if you're not too hungry).
Sadly, we were quite hungry that day and I wasn't able to capture a picture of these dishes.
However, I did take a picture of the dessert (fried ice cream with berries). Wow was this dessert both pretty and delicious!! It was the perfect ending to a great meal! The dish comes with nuts, but if you're allergic be sure to ask the waiter/waitress for it without nuts. I found them to be very accommodating to this request!!"}
{"text":"We went two nights in a row during a very cold spell in Tempe and it hit the spot. Nice servers, fresh ingredients, clean food presentation, and decent vegetarian (broth & protein) options.

I liked the garlic paste a lot and added extra noodles and my bf added everything in there plus extra noodles and liked it all. That's a whole lot of noodles, but good if you're really hungry.

I'd like more veg options (extra carrots or anything really) just to round out my meal, but we got double edamame in a bento box the second night and that filled the void."}
{"text":"If you wish you were at a bar on the south side, but happen to find yourself in Lawrenceville, Umami may be for you.  The food here is good, but everything else is not.  The evening I went, they had an extremely obnoxious DJ playing hip hop music at uncomfortable volumes that undoubtedly produce some hearing loss.  I asked the server if they could turn down the music.  They did not.  Another server later asked me to move over closer to the loud music to accommodate a larger party.  I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go to the Republic of Ramen but the quality of the food and service has really gone downhill so I was excited when I saw Umanis on Channel 3 so my husband and I went to try them out. The food was delicious, it looked great and the service was wonderful. I have recommended them to friends and family. About a week ago we took our grandson over and his order came out incorrect but it was handled in the most professional manner. Each of the servers as well as the manager came to apologize and when the bill came his order which had promptly been cooected had been removed. I was not expecting this but it says how much they value their customers. I have definately found my new ramen house."}
{"text":"I know the owners of Umami, but it's not swaying my review. If I wasn't thrilled, I'd just keep quiet and not post anything. That said:

I never in my wildest dreams thought a bowl of ramen could be so incredibly tasty.  My experience with ramen is limited .... Probably just to the store bought poor-college-kid stuff. I had no idea there was anything else, but this place is definitely something else!  

My lady and I shared a bowl of the sea salt broth ramen with roasted chicken and bean sprouts. The broth is amazing. Rich and flavorful and crave-inducing. The chicken added is real-deal roasted chicken (even had a little skin on it which was great). Bean sprouts were plump and fresh and crisp.  Noodles were cooked perfectly and never mushy. The more we ate, the more we wanted to keep eating!

My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Also had some sake like never before as well .... I'm not a huge fan of the stuff, but we tasted two different varieties that were chilled and incredibly sweet and delicious. Definitely not your typical drop-it-in-beer sake .... And I'm hoping to enjoy one of the interesting cocktails the bartender was creating on my next visit as well. 

I didn't understand how in the world an $8 bowl of ramen was logical when the stuff sells for 15 cents at the grocery store. I have been THOROUGHLY schooled. It's worth every penny and is NOTHING like the dried junk. I'm going back.  Hmmm .... Maybe this afternoon!"}
{"text":"Holy delicious!!! I have lived in Asia and can be extremely picky about my food. While this place is not strictly Japanese, Chinese, or Korean food it is still delicious. 

They offer an all-you-can-eat option and I highly recommend it. You can order anything on the menu but make sure you ask for a half order! 

I am allergic to shellfish and the waiter helped me pick out a few that I would be able to have. You need to try the Bam Bam Roll!!

The Spicy Garlic Edamame is delicious!  The sauce served with the gyoza is delicious too. Their version of Bulgogi is good too; it has a sweet taste to it but it is delicious. 

They offer a military discount of 10% too.  There is no baby changing station in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere that shady park offers; it has that in the city kind of vibe while still being intimate! The concept is really cool too. They have 3 restaurants under one roof so all members of your group can find something that caters to them. 

I'm a ramen enthusiast so I had to come here to taste what they had and I wasn't disappointed. I had the shiyo ramen and I've had the miso ramen in the past. They have build your own where you pick the broth and toppings, or you can get their pre-picked options (which have pretty cute names btw!) the price of the toppings start to add up if you get a lot. 

The only negative I would have to say is that the broth is pretty salty. Both times I've been the broth was pretty salty. Overall a nice little spot to cure your ramen cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is officially mine and my boyfriend's go-to place for sushi. The fact that it's only a 10 minute drive from home makes it even 10x better. The sushi is fresh and cooked very well. The service is great. The sushi comes out within a very reasonable timely manner, not too fast to where it's crowding the table, not too slow to where you're waiting for the next plate.


Also, it's the same owner of Hwaro's aka mine and my boyfriend go-to place for KBBQ. It's perfect!"}
{"text":"If you have little or no experience with ramen, this place will suffice, as the other reviews show. If your only experiences with ramen consists of top ramen or ramen places in Phoenix, then do not hesitate to go here. It's in a good area (albeit kinda hidden in the building they are in), and they seem to have a good selection of sake and alcohol. 

~

BUT....If you are a true ramen enthusiast, do not expect anything close to what your standards are used to. 

The way you order is by checking off options on a slip of paper. Broth choices: a sea salt broth, a shoyu (soy) broth and a miso broth. I got the miso broth, and paid for extra toppings: charsiu, togarashi corn, and roasted garlic. The toppings that come standard with their ramen is spinach (really odd...), a sliver of fish cake, a slice of dried nori and scallions. 

Charsiu: I was really, really saddened by their charsiu. It was really hard, and they served it cold. If you are used to melt-in-your-mouth, savory and tender charsiu, do not waste an extra $2 to add the charsiu here.

Broth: My miso broth was ok. Lacked any real depth of flavor, but it wasn't terrible. I ordered my husband the shoyu ramen for take out and he really didn't like it. Said it tasted like the powdered seasoning from top ramen, but even saltier.

Noodles: I was satisfied with the noodles here. Not the best, but they are the best I've had so far in Phoenix. They do not make their noodles in house; it is shipped here from LA. That doesn't bother me though. I am used to ramen shops where you can see cute old japanese men making the noodles and shouting greetings to you as you enter their restaurant, but I am sure that won't be a sight I'll see here in Phoenix. 

~

Their grand opening is this Friday, and they will be rolling out their Tonkatsu broth then. That's usually what I would get, or a paitan or tan tan broth (but they don't have that). Maybe in the future I will stop by and try their Tonkatsu broth on a cold winter day...but a good tonkatsu broth needs to stew for a good two days and I remain skeptical.

I will admit, I am a ramen snob. So that's why I must re-iterate that this place will be really good for most people who really haven't had authentic ramen. But alas, my never-ending quest for good ramen in Phoenix continues..."}
{"text":"I love Umami when I cannot get to Republic Ramen.  The Togiashi corn, butter, and garlic are must haves with the paitain base."}
{"text":"Besides the whiskey imported from Japan, the drinks were well priced and authentic  . I had a Kirin draft and sake  shot for $5. The pork gyoza were deliciously different than your typical  dumplings. Definitely coming here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great date spot. Limited seating so make sure you make a reservation. The udon noodles and ribs were extremely well prepared. Dessert looked good, but we went across the street to Jenny's. Cocktails were very good as well. Will recommend to everybody in the area."}
{"text":"I used to never like eel but I love the Unagi Don here! I would not order eel anywhere else. They have great service and their sushi is pretty good for Northwest Las Vegas. They have a variety selections of classic rolls and specialty rolls. The only thing I don't like is that the place is to dim."}
{"text":"By far one of the coolest places and experiences I've ever been to! So unique! Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"The paitan broth was very rich and goood but DO NOT get the shio broth. Its basically salt water. I know the description says sea salt but I thought it meant it was flavored with sea salt not drenched in sea salt. The noodles can also be hard at times, like it needs to be cooked a but more. Other than that this place is good."}
{"text":"To me, the noodles here (or maybe evrything with the meats combined) can be a bit on the salty side at times. Other than that, they have great toppings."}
{"text":"This place opened since january but me & my mom's bestfriend just found it today from yelp. I'm glad there is a good japanese food in this area. Even thou not really near my house, it is closer than I have to go to spring mountain. Nice, calm, comfortable & quite cozy in there. 
We came here for lunch, Our server \"Caleb\" greed us and served us. We like him, Super nice person & he make sure if we need anything. Actually all server are really nice there.
For starter we order tempura shrimp ($7), tempura have a good flavor.
* I ordered Ramen combo $12.. 
first you choose your ramen (miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, soyu ramen, udon) big portion
second you choose your rolls ( california, spicy tuna & 2 other kinds) 
third you choose your salad ( cucumber salad or house salad w ginger dressing)
* My mom's bestfriend  order Teriyaki chicken bowl (big portion) comes with salad ( choose between cucumber salad or house s ($10), california rolls ($5)

We really like all the food that we ordered. We only eat 1/4 portion from our ramen & teriyaki bowl, it is big portion so we have leftover to bring home. 
I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Really awesome atmosphere. They have 3 different rooms which is really cool (including a patio area). Unsure how pizza fits into the mix but we got it with our ramen anyway. It was good (because bread, cheese, and sauce can't be bad), but nothing extraordinary. Also got the chicken noodle ramen with vegetarian broth and subbed house noodles. Their broth was pretty salty (unsure if that's what it's always like) but the noodles were fantastic. They also have live music on some nights but when we were there it was an $18 cover which I think is a little steep. 

I'll come back for their house noodles and to give their ramen broth a second chance. Great place to come hangout with friends because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant,,,definitely a neighborhood gem!! The setting was beautiful, the food was excellent and the service was above the top!! It is a great spot..."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Phoenix, hands down...  Having said that, I can think of only one other legitimate ramen place in town.

I've been to Umami twice now.  The first time I went, the broth was too salty.  On my second visit, I ordered the miso with charshiu, and the chef really hit that one out of the park.  There are things here and there that could be improved.  Some suggestions: larger nori sheets, a softer yolk on the egg, and better options of sides (e.g., onigiri, gyoza, etc.)  The noodles themselves are ordered from LA and maintain a chewy consistency even in the soup (as it should).  All in all, they make some good ramen.  Prices are a little high, as many other reviewers have commented, but the restaurant is in a nice part of town and they really don't have much competition.

Bottom line:  I'm grateful that Umami exists in a city that is severely lacking in Asian food options and will be visiting on a regular basis.  A solid four stars."}
{"text":"Totally amazing ramen! I like this better than Pho...! Great flavors, try the pork belly! Super filling."}
{"text":"Came in with some friends from out of town on a Saturday night and had a great time. Couldn't get a seat in the traditional seating area, which was to be expected for a Saturday, but the bar area suited us fine. All the servers were friendly and our drinks and food came very timely. We shared edamame (or Tokyo beans for my Parks and Rec fans lol) the chicken skin, chicken heart, and pork belly skewers. All were delicious. I got the standard ramen with extra spicy chili sauce. The eggs that came in the ramen were out of this world. Everything was incredibly flavorful and well presented. I will definitely be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Great place, I would recommend it highly. My wife loved their udon & I kept it simple with the hanger steak; both were cooked to perfection. The service is what really elevates it with attentive & knowledgeable hosts. Definitely a must try if you're in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Best ramen we've ever had. Garlic edamame was great too. Service was good and the patio was beautiful."}
{"text":"Finally! A delicious Japanese restaurant in the Durango, Northwest area! 
Restaurant is quiet, clean, not much decor inside; very simple. 
Food is really yummy! Their menu offers sooo many types of Japanese rolls - from raw to baked to fried. They have lunch and dinner 'combos', noodles, rice bowls, soups, salads. They also offer an All You Can Eat on all the rolls! If you're not a voracious eater, you can go the a la carte way. 
We came around lunch time. The place wasn't filled up but we had to wait a couple of minutes before we were seated as there were only 2 hosts working that time. But once we got seated, service was fast. We didn't have to wait too long for the food. I'd say our food was served in less than 15 minutes; the rolls just a tad bit longer but it was soooo good it was worth the wait. 
Price wise ($-$$), it's almost the same as other Japanese or sushi restaurants that have similar menu. 
Highly recommend to visit and try!"}
{"text":"(Centennial Area)All you can eat, great variety, not so busy, good service, good sushi, $1 sake drinks, however they just need to update their menu, some of the things are scratched out and some they don't have."}
{"text":"A heads up they stop serving ramen from 3 to 5pm. My friend and i went to have ramen and it was 330 this is how I found out. The waitress told her 2 groups left because of this too. Since I don't know the area and I was starving decided to stay. I got the spam pizza which pretty much tasted like cheese with teriyaki sauce pizza. The squid salad was fine good portion for the happy hour price."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a sushi restaurant in Centennial hills would be this good! I don't usually write reviews but had to for this restaurant. If you know good quality sushi then you know their pricing is reasonable. Quality of fish was fresh and presentation was excellent! Service was also excellent and the staff made sure you were taken care off! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Umami: first impression: Loved it! We went there on a Friday evening at 6pm. We made reservations, as recommended. The outside of the restaurant wasn't clearly marked, which was slightly strange to me, but upon entering, the vibe was immediately cool. I immediately noticed the smell of sushi, not fishy, but fresh and lemony. You climb 2 flights of stairs and enter a really chill atmosphere. We sat at a table, but the best part was the bar area where you could watch the kitchen. Well sit there next time. We got drinks, very reasonably priced for Happy Hour. Some food items we got, the mushroom custard: this was my favorite thing! The flavor and texture was AMAZING! Get it! Also, the Scottish Salmon skewer: delicious and tender, the Wagyu tenderloin skewer: my boyfriend says this was his favorite taste. He got the sushi bowl, which was well worth the $18, boasting a wonderful assortment of fish, rice, sauces, and ginger. I got the pancake, which was super flavorful and huge. We can't wait to go back! Definitely would recommend trying some of the more unique items on the menu, the skewers, and that custard. I've never had anything like it."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing very intimate and low key  great place to take
Your boo the menu is amazing and the cocktails are to die for!!!! So check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"Under new management and it is now all you can eat like every other crappy sushi place. So disappointed. Really loved Umami before. I had to hold my breath just to get the spicy tuna roll that I ordered down. I have had better sushi from grocery stores. Have never been so sad to see a great restaurant go...."}
{"text":"A little pricey but pretty good overall. We stuck to the sushi menu. We did have a little bit of an issue with them not complying with the avocado allergy we had at the table. But it wasn't a big issue overall because we noticed both times and sent it back. I would return here and enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.

It is a cute little place.  And the concepts of the dishes are interesting, sort of modernized Asian.  But the execution was weak.  We had two spicy dishes: spicy tuna rolls and I had udon noodles with spicy beef and neither was anything close to spicy.  And just about everything we had was \"close, but it just needs something....\".  

On top of that, the service was weak.  Everyone was pleasant, but the kitchen was very slow, and the servers didn't make up for it.  They were pretty slow and inattentive.

It was $84 for two people before the tip (I had a beer, my wife had a cocktail, two dinners, two appetizers, one salad), and I expect a lot more for that price in this area.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls, and the lobster ramens real good too. Didn't really wow me to get five stars but pretty solid. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot with great food. Spencer, our waiter was soooo busy but still very attentive."}
{"text":"Fabulous addition to the neighborhood! I love having awesome places near by and this place is not one to be overlooked. I came here on a Monday night, surprisingly no one was there! Even better, more space for me! 
I really like the decor, dark and sexy. It's really dim with open space and a couple of booths. May be because we were the only ones there but the it felt really spacious. 
Food was fantastic! We tried a couple of rolls and washed it down with blueberry sake. Fish tasted really fresh. 
Tried: Anna Roll, Red Bull Roll, Rock N Roll. My absolute favorite was the Rock N Roll, if you like raw fish and cucumber - this roll is for you. I love rice-less rolls and I LOVE raw fish so this was BOMB for me. It comes with a sauce on the side. 
The Red Bull roll was really good as well, it comes with jalapeno slices on top which is a \"no thank you for me\" but it was yummy without it. Escolar on top and soft shell crab and cucumber inside wrapped truly fresh rice.
My partner in crime for the day got the Anna roll to honor herself :) It was pretty good as well. She also had Toro sushi, which I did not try but she really enjoyed. 
There are a few things on the menu that I look forward to coming back and trying. I actually attempted to order lobster ramen to-go the other day and it was going to be a 45 min wait. Ugh! I was next door and did not plan to wait around for 45 min but will definitely come back for it in the near tomorrow."}
{"text":"Umami is Umazing! Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious food! The screaming O and mushroom toban are my new favs! If you are a sushi fan give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Really great place for the northwest area of town to have ramen! Their lunch specials are great and their dinner menu has a lot of options as well. We've been here 2x now and have not been disappointed with service and food. 

Gyoza 4/5 stars 
they are tender, juicy and delicious. Only 4 stars because I do not like the dipping sauce. It's to spicy and wipes out your taste palette. 

Ramen 4/5 
Broth is rich and yummy. It could have more meat to it. The pork belly is tender and full of flavor. 

Karaage chicken 5/5 
This place honestly makes the best karaage chicken. Tender crispy juicy and the dipping sauce is BOMB!"}
{"text":"The reviews were hit or miss on this new sushi place. I like the fact that they are ayce now, it gives me a chance to try a variety of rolls and find my favorites. The baked lobster roll was good, not my favorite of the day-that was reserved for the super white. If you are not a fan of raw fish you need to try this one. It will convert you!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  Good spot for a date night. We enjoyed the decor and general atmosphere. It was quiet enough to have good conversation. Umami certainly helps to diversify the South Side dining options with a bit of a classier feel."}
{"text":"Everything was amazingly good! The ramen bowls were excellent as well as the Japanese inspired cocktails and beers."}
{"text":"Love the atmospehere. Love the ramen. Love the beer. Umami is an awesome place for foodies. The choshu and chicken ramen in pork and chicken broth was wonderful. If you find yourself in downtown Tempe, definitely check this place out. The location is a little off the beaten path. A quick google map search will pinpoint you to the exact location."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was quite impressed when my girlfriend and I found this sushi restaurant. It was a new sushi place close by and we wanted to give it a try. We instantly thought the place was classy and very cute. We were greeted right away, and let me say our waitress was amazing ! Nina, she was a great host , we took a min to order but she was patient and came back every couple mins to see if we were ready. Besides the wonderful service from Nina, the food was delicious! From the sake to the sushi it was tasty food ! Go there eat, and by all means ORDER THE STRAWBERRY CHAMPAGNE CAKE!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but way overpriced for what you get. The ambiance was quite nice and the place is very well decorated. But they charge too much and don't give you enough food.

Before we even stepped in the door my friend warned me that often after eating here he feels the need to go get a cheeseburger. He was right on. I needed a cheeseburger when I was done. 

Ok, what did we eat? My girl and I got two appetizers: the bacon and the goat cheese dumplings. The bacon appetizer was a disappointingly small hunk of pork that tasted like a hunk of salty pork. I was thoroughly unimpressed. The goat cheese dumplings on the other hand, were the highlight of the meal. Delicious and gooey and tender with an awesome sauce. My girlfriend liked the sauce so much she even ordered some rice to soak up the sauce, but the rice was very unusual tasting and not very good. How can a restaurant call themselves Asian and do rice wrong?

Also, my friends got the salmon roll (the day's special) and the fish was just old. Ugh.

Ok, so then we got the udon for our dinner, which was actually quite tasty. BUT, it still pains me to pay $17 for a bowl of noodles. 

Overall I would say I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Lobster Ramen was very nice the only issue was the actual lobster was tough to eat. Over cooked just a little. Everything else was very good and the kid's loved the teriyaki chicken..."}
{"text":"A really cool, fun spot for Japanese food! It's in a slightly hidden upstairs area with a nondescript entrance, and once you enter, the decor and dim lighting make you feel like you're in a different world. 

I liked this place because there's a little something for everyone, whether you want a fun cocktail, robata, sushi, or heartier Japanese food. 

We had a wide variety of dishes including he shrimp skewers ($2.50 each), salmon and yellowtail sashimi (very fresh!), the Nashu Shigiyaki (eggplant with ground chicken and other goodies on top - a bit salty from what I can remember), and a special of the night which was a messy but very flavorful and well-cooked short rib over rice. I washed all of this down with a cocktail called the 7 Day Vacation, which I no longer see on the cocktail menu online but I mostly chose because of the fun tiki glass presentation. It was pretty sweet and actually stronger than I expected (maybe because I downed it before the food actually arrived), but it came with a fun purple bendy straw so there's that! 

Coming from NYC restaurant prices I thought it was actually a pretty good value from start to finish, and the service was on point as well. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a jones for Japanese fusion dining."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the city. I've been here now twice and loved everything about this restaurant both times. I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen area on both visits and enjoyed watching the process of the chefs prepping and cooking such unique food. Although I would love to go back and sit at one of the tables tucked down into the floors, I very much enjoyed the show of cooking that came with our seats. You surely don't feel like you're in Pittsburgh anymore once you climb the flights of stairs to get to this uniquely decorated restaurant. 

From our cocktails, to our appetizer skewers, to our entrees.. everything was delicious. But by far my favorite thing is the savory pancake on the appetizer menu. I don't know the legitimate name for it but it says \"savory pancake\" underneath of it's actual name and that's all I needed to see to order it. The pancake ingredients changed from one visit to the next, but I can't tell you which was better because they were both so. good. I can't wait to go back to consume another one. Our second favorite thing were the bacon wrapped quail egg skewers. Another thing not to miss! Everything we ate had such great flavor combinations, and the staff was so helpful and pleasant on top of it."}
{"text":"Sat the bar, got okonomiyaki (pancake), bottle of dreamy clouds saki, and Budweiser. I was surprised at how hearty this pancake was, made of fish, cabbage, bacon and grilled. And a very large portion that only costs $10. Will try the whole grilled fish and whole squid next time."}
{"text":"Ramen was very salty and the service was very slow even there was only few people. 
And we asked for hot water the server said we do not have a hot water.
It was very disappointed place and felt bad!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try because the food was really good the first time. So last night we went again and we sat on the patio because we brought our big dog and it was nice outside. Our server was Nikko, he was great brought our dog a big bowl of water and was on top of everything. He does not work Thursdays, Saturdays or Sundays so I would not go on those days, I only want to be sat in his section. If you are thinking about going for great ramen then do yourself a favor and ask for Nikko's section."}
{"text":"Just tried Umami for the  first time, and it was delicious! Looking foward to our next visit! The staff was seriously the friendliest and so helpful! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"We had been loyal patrons of this restaurant until tonight.  They've changed ownership and now are just like every other bland \"all you can eat\" place.  One of the things that we loved about the prior menu was that they used quality ingredients, offered high end sashimi and other non-roll type food.  For this reason, we were there at least once a week and spent well over $100 each visit.  Tonight we sadly left without ordering and won't be back.

In addition to their new menu problems, any business that decides it's ok to fire all of their chefs and most of their waitstaff with NO NOTICE is not one that I want to spend my money at.  The only thing better than their food was their previous staff.  We truly enjoyed that we could walk in, be seated, and the waitstaff knew what we wanted to drink and the chefs knew what appetizers we wanted to start with. Firing these talented people was a huge business blunder.

Sorry Umami, you've lost extremely loyal customers who are very vocal.  Instead of sending new people your way, we are informing all of our friends about everything we saw tonight and warning them about the steps down in quality."}

{"text":"We love everything about this place! Their whole fish is to die for. Their tonkotsu ramen and robatayaki (especially wagyu beef and quail eggs), their sashimi bowls..
Amazing food, great staff."}
{"text":"Umami at Shady Park recently opened after remodeling. The indoor dining area is warmly lit and well-decorated. The added sushi bar is cool but a little small.

The service was great, no complaints. The food was good but the sushi rolls were much smaller than expected for similar prices to other sushi restaurants. A friend and I shared the Scorpion Roll, Caterpillar Roll and Miso Hungry ramen with fried chicken added. My boyfriend got spicy ramen and a Spicy Tuna roll, he was happy.

Although the rolls were small, we had plenty to eat with ramen to take home. Overall, very satisfied with the ambiance, service, good quality and prices. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent sashimi & sushi 
They serve super fresh and thick pieces salmon and tuna. I will go back definitely"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. My boyfriend and I were craving AYCE sushi & we decided to try Umami. We were immediately assured the food would be amazing when we noticed Umami is owned by the same owners are Hwaro, the AYCE cajun spot, Sakana & Sushi Neko. 

It's $21.95 for lunch & $26.95 for dinner & worth every penny! Our server was kind enough to tell us for the rolls you can order **half rolls** so we were able to try more. She also checked up on us often to ask if we wanted to order more. All the food that came out was delicious and one of the better sushi restaurants i've tried. Try \"the shit,\" \"pang\" and the monkey brain roll!

For dessert, we had an affogato, mini honey toast + red bean & green tea ice cream!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Seriously this place was so good. I didn't want to stop ordering food. I ended up ordering sashimi, dumplings, and udon noodles. All of which were delicious. I like the fact that you can order as you go but they don't take a long time between each order. I tend to have eyes bigger then my stomach so a lot of times when I go to restaurants where it's small plates I tend to order too many. That was not the case at Umami. I was able to order 1 dish at a time and once I ordered another it was out within 5 minutes so it didn't turn into a 2 hour meal. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the drink I got. The drink with the pop rocks sounded exciting but it was sadly not that great. I definitely would like to go back and try some of the other drinks though."}
{"text":"We have visited Umami a few times now. On our first visit, we fell in love! We couldn't wait to go back. We have tried a variety of items on their menu, and have enjoyed everything. 

We recently visited with some friends who had never been there before. We were excited to have them try everything! We made a late reservation at 9:30, but got there early to have some drinks. They had a drink special going: a light beer and sake shot for $5. Without a table or a seat at the bar, our group was definitely in the way and had to constantly move so people could get by. There isn't room for standing at all. 

Once at our table, we ordered a the sashimi rice bowl to share. It offered once of the best tasting pieces of salmon I've ever had! We also ordered the edamame - It was pretty standard. For our meals we ordered the ramen and the udon noodles. Both were amazing!! 

Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. Only negative is that it is located on the third? floor, and you have to walk up many stairs. This would be a huge problem for anyone who has difficulty with stairs or needs an accessible entrance."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a good Japanese restaurant on our side of town. After trying it, I must say the verdict is mixed. 

The ambience is beautiful. Lot of space, beautifully and professionally decorated.  It looks very upscale. The staff was nice. 

The food was not great, but not bad either. We ordered sushi, tempura ice cream, ramen, and karaage chicken. The sushi rice was a tad colder and harder than what we're used to. Fish was OK. Chicken was warm and not piping hot as most other good places. But the sauce was very interesting and delicious. 

Service was work in progress. It was very busy. And our dishes were taking a bit longer. One was completely forgotten.  And other guests' dishes were repeatedly offered to us. 

We will give it another chance once the dust settles."}
{"text":"Umami
21 E 6th St
Tempe

Having heard people talk about how they liked this place and how inexpensive it was for the college crowd to eat there, I had to try it myself.  This place is known for its bowls of ramen soup that is supposed to be similar to what one would get in Japan.

Having lived in Japan for a while, I found little similarity to what one would get there other than the bowl and chopsticks.

To be fair, you decide on the type of broth and ingredients that are put into it, unlike Japan where the combinations are mostly figured out for you and you order from a picture description. 

I ordered the paitan broth, which is supposed to be their signature broth made from a meat stock. It was o.k. but nothing to brag about. A somewhat thin, watery stock lacking in any punch of flavor. The chasu (pork belly) on the other hand was nicely done and had very good flavor. I also ordered the soft boiled egg in my soup along with the garlic. The egg was close to being properly cooked and the garlic was just a smear on the edge of the bowl. 

Perhaps the biggest problem for me was the noodles. In Japan, the noodles are a basic part of the soup and cooking them properly is a requirement for any noodle shop to survive. These noodles were not even of the right type for a ramen soup, and were under cooked. Very disappointing to say the least.

I also ordered their 6 item plate to try. It had an excellent seaweed salad, a very good squid salad, and four other items that I will try to describe properly.

First was a hand roll. Having eaten literally more than a hundred hand rolls, this left a lot to be desired. It was  like no other hand roll I have ever been served. Next was the garlic edamame. Nothing special here, with little garlic flavor and your typical beans. Next was the kimchi. Even though kimchi is Korean and not Japanese, it had the potential to be a nice if somewhat unusual addition to the menu. Unfortunately, the kimchi was too young and had not had enough time to ferment properly and develop its flavor. It was very harsh on the palate. Last on the plate was tofu. There isn't much to say here either as the tofu was not served with any special sauce or flavoring at all.

I drank a green tea with my meal ($2.50) which was adequate. 

Parking was underneath in the public garage, and the cashier stamped my ticket so that parking was free. Cleanliness was apparent throughout, and the waitress I had was cheery and nice.

I'm not sure what the budget of college students is today, but my meal came to $25.94. That doesn't seem to be on most college students budgets that I know of, but perhaps times have changed and students have a lot more money to spend.

Overall, I was fairly disappointed by my visit.

2 stars for cleanliness and service."}
{"text":"I had the chicken, pork and the owner brought me a sample of the slow roasted pork. O. M. G. Delicious. Come hungry and leave satisfied. Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: fantastic ambience! Taste is above average and presentation is amazing (for sushi/sashimi). Wait is very long so don't come if you're in a rush. It's a little pricey for the portion size and taste. 

I want to start out by saying that I would definitely give Umami a 5 if it were slightly cheaper. The vibe of the place alone makes me want to go back multiple times. I may be biased since I love r&b, but the DJ was superb and the fact that they even have a live DJ is amazing. Kudos to that guy for making my experience a lot better. 

Anyway, about the food - the first thing I noticed was how great the presentation was. We sat right in front of the sushi chef, so that may have made a difference, but the way he plated and cut the sashimi right in front of us was beautiful. The taste of the ramen was good - not phenomenal or anything, but good. I would argue that it's pricey for the taste, though, but I did enjoy the meal. I would feel bad ordering this at another place with the price, but because Umami has a great atmosphere, it was ok. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So glad to have Umami in Centennial. A good sushi place was desperately needed in this area, and this is some quality food!
We have been twice and have sat at the sushi bar both times, which is my recommendation. The chefs are so helpful and creative. Both times we had the live lobster sashimi and it did not disappoint!!!!
All the sashimi and sushi was fabulous!!! We had hamachi, kanpachi, sake, ocean trout, bluefin tuna, scallops. We went with what the chef recommended on most part and it was great!!!!
I really loved the garlic edamame as well. 
We haven't ordered much from the kitchen but they have a pretty good menu as far as that goes. 
The lobster ramen looks amazing, I gotta make a trip out for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Under new management. Came here 3 weeks ago and had the best sushi like we normally do. About three days ago I was craving sushi so decided to stop by and was surprised by the new management sign outside. Still decided to go in hoping the menu, quality  and attention to detail was still the same. But nope the menu is completely different and worst of all they converted the restaurant to an all you can eat place. After glancing at the menu for about 15 minutes because nothing stood out and also service was terrible. We just decided to walk out and eat elsewhere.  Extremely disappointed that I lost my favorite local sushi place. PS also all my pictures from this place are from the previous management."}
{"text":"Came here on 11/06 with GF based on Yelp reviews and photos.  We were 10 minutes away and decided to call if reservation were needed and was told their menu changed as of today. It's now ayce \"all you can eat\" for $26.99.  We were skeptical but we were so close and decided to give it a try. Since it was their first day of the menu change nobody knows the menu not even the sushi chef. Ordered 1st round and some items were good and most were not, the Uni was brown and watery, fish freshness was sketchy. Ordered something called \"honey screaming O\", suppose to be salmon with crab stick but what came out was seared tuna over radish. Unami fried rice was bland, needed salt or soy sauce. Bacon wrapped scallop all bacon can't even taste the scallop. Baked scallop roll barely had any scallop on top. They need to work out their kinks, oh wait it's more like knots."}
{"text":"Such a Great place to go. Very nice and polite Staff.  I had the shrimp tempura Udon special and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great atmosphere and a very good selection of sushi. We came during lunchtime and sat at the bar. Not overcrowded and the background music wasn't overbearing. Our waitress was very attentive. She filled our waters and handed us more napkins without asking. I had the ramen lunch special with a choice of a roll and salad. Everything was delicious. We also ordered the baked green mussels, jalapeño poppers, and two rolls. My wife had to stop me from eating. Soup broth is made in house and was very rich and flavorful. Definitely coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in PGH. Awesome staff, amazing drinks and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Chagrin Falls and one of the best I've been to overall. Everything is fresh, seafood is flown in daily and they serve the best cocktails in Ohio. Try everything, it's all food."}
{"text":"Super awesome restaurant. My wife and I eat sushi all the time and have been looking for a restaurant closer to our house. The staff and their sushi chef we're super friendly. Some of the freshest fish and very clean. They always treat us awesome and also treat our kids amazing. If I could I would give this place 10 stars. Yun is the manager and he makes us feel like we are in our own house eating. Great place for all kinds of occasions."}
{"text":"If I could go here every day I would. The pork and shrimp shumai is my absolute favorite. Typically when a group of us go we need at least a couple orders of it. The the pork belly robata is also a favorite of mine, and really I could go on and on listing the items I love at Umami. Not to mention the atmosphere is excellent. They have a DJ there most nights.

The only downside I'd have to say is that it is a bit of work to get there as it sits above Cantina. It's not the easiest to find and lots of stairs."}
{"text":"I think I haven't reviewed Umami yet because I kind of wanted to keep it a secret. It has become my favorite place to get away for lunch on a work day. It is within walking distance of my office and is just a block west of Mill Ave and 6th Street but it feels like a special hidden place. They are never crowded and the staff is always relaxed and friendly. The décor seems very cool and trendy and their prices are pretty reasonable so I am not sure why there aren't a ton of students in here all the time. But that's fine with me, I like things quiet and chill the way they are now. They do have a really good bar so maybe they get a little more lively during happy hour? I'll have to check that out sometime...

The first time I wandered in here I sat at the bar and a friendly young guy (who was pretty easy on the eyes, btw) explained the menu to me and the ordering process. Basically you fill out a card and check the boxes for the flavor of broth you want, then pick the protein, then whatever extra toppings you want (each have the addl cost listed). Don't worry about picking any of the extras if you don't want to because even the \"basic\" bowls of ramen have plenty of good stuff in there - bok choy, carrot, radish, bamboo shoots... and of course those super tasty noodles! My favorite broth is the Paitan. It sort of tastes like a miso broth but with more flavor. I agree with the other reviewers that sometimes the broth can be a little too salty so I had to subtract one star. However I love all the flavor and the vegetables and noodles are always delicious. The chicken or pork is precooked but pretty rare so it finished cooking in the broth. All the flavors meld together and create a wonderful bowl of goodness. Yum, yum, my mouth is watering right now!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled. Maybe I'm a snob. But hear me out. 

Flew down to PHX for spring training from San Francisco to catch our world champion GIANTS in the cactus league. Bay area has a lot of good ramen, but my cousin saw an ad for umami in the southwest magazine. We were in the area all decided to try it. 

First off, umami uses order forms that customers fill out to specify exactly what you want to order. Each order has a name on top. Out of my party of 5, only 1 of our orders were correct. How does that even happen? I'm just confused. Ramen was decent. Not terrible not great. That's it. Just don't understand how orders are messed up when they're clearly written down. No miscommunication to blame. Wtf."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... maybe I had an off night but was incredibly disappointed.

Myself and 2 friends sat at the bar on a Thursday night.  We ordered drinks first, they were fine.

Ordered the deviled eggs and the pancake.  Both were good, interesting flavors,  close to 4 stars.  

I ordered the udon and my both ordered the tonkatsu ramen, add chili.  The udon was pretty good, 3 stars.  Knife cuts on the veg were very small so difficult to eat with a chopstick with the thick/heavier udon noodle.  One of my friends got the unagi hand roll and thought that was the best hung we ate (\"bomb.com\").

The ramen deserves its own paragraph.  To levelset, we just got back from Japan and that is my standard. Regardless, I am beyond confused why some think this ramen is the best ramen in Pittsburgh.  The ramen broth was inedible. Basically drinking ocean water.  I guess some are considering that flavor? The meat on the bone is difficult to incorporate into the ramen with chopsticks.  It is nothing like the tonkatsu ramen we had in Tokyo and I will never be back for it.  Negative stars.  

Overall giving 3 stars because appetizers were ok and our bartender did end up taking the ramen off of the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food, cool atmosphere.  I really enjoyed my meal but the miso soup and the dumplings were so flavorful I had to write this review.  These are usually just simple , nothing special starters but in this case the ingredients where amazing. The miso was extraordinary with seaweed that actually had flavor and tofu that was tender and tasty not squares of tasteless rubber.  When I commented on this, my wonderful server (Christine?) told me they actually make their own tofu!  The pork dumplings also were unique in the way they were joined together and pan fried with very crispy edges.  They come with a light dipping sauce that perfectly complimented the ingredients in the dumplings.  The fried chicken I had for my main course was also quite good but I was not a fan of the gravy.  So I said something and my waitress brought out the dipping sauce they serve with their tempura dish and some fresh chiles.  I added some heat and started dipping away.  Yummmm!  All I have say is thank you guys! What an unexpectedly great late night dinner."}
{"text":"Umami: \"A taste sensation that is meaty or savory and is produced by several amino acids and nucleotides (as glutamate and aspartate)\" (From Merriam-Webster.com).

Combine those amino acids and nucleotides in a bowl, add some ramen noodles and mix ins and BAM! You have yourself a \"taste sensation\" at Umami restaurant. 

The location is in the Shady Park building which houses both Umami and a pizza place/bar. The seating at Shady Park is for both businesses so your menu will have both pizza/bar options as well as ramen options, and while you slurp your noodles at your table your neighbor might be enjoying a slice of pepperoni with bread sticks.

The interior itself is very retro. It has a cavernous, '70s vibe to it. The ramen menu itself has a set base price of $8 that includes your choice of broth, and will include pickled bamboo shoots, scallions, naruto (Fish cake), carrot flower, nori (Seaweed) and spinach. There are a multitude of add-ins you can have for an extra charge. I had the paitan broth and added soft egg ($1.50) and seared tofu ($1). The paitan broth was full flavored and rich and I loved the soft egg and tofu with the other included add-ins. I was disappointed that they only give you one naruto piece and one carrot flower for your bowl. It's definitely not enough for the bowl they give you! The noodles themselves were the typical curly ramen noodle shape and texture. I do prefer the noodles at Tampopo ramen more though because they are freshly made in house and have a good \"bite\" to them.

Next time I'm in the ASU area again I'll be back to try more ramen!"}
{"text":"This was our first time stopping by.  The restaurant was pretty slow so our wait staff was extra attentive.  Food was ok, however, the service was superb, by far some best in this part of town in our opinion.  Great location too. After dinner we were able to shop in and around the nearby shopping center.  Looking forward to trying out more of the menu items. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere, interesting menu, good bites. 

I usually get the Udon noodles because a I'm not big on ramen. The udon noodles are tasty and the serving is large.

Another tasty bite is the pork belly robota. Super delicious, but, like most robota, not a lot of food. Get two! It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is chagrin falls only worthwhile restaurant. Meaning if it wasn't in a great locale it'd still be worth the effort it takes to get a table in this little gem."}
{"text":"If you like high tops and a cool sushi bar vibe this place is for you. The sashimi rice bowl is the best.  Try the bacon wrapped quail eggs to start, as well as the octopus balls.
The Ginger Ginger cocktail goes well with this meal. We also had the hot saki which I found a little overly sweet for my taste.
The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. 
Will be going back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese in Pittsburgh.   Amazing cocktails.  Wonderful ambiance.  My favorite new spot"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to eat Ramen in town, other than a few select places which I won't mention to draw attention away from Umami. I could eat here twice a week, if my girlfriend would let me, hahah! Great service, seat yourself & prompt deliveries for food. They close mid day in order to maintain the amazing quality of their broth, some people complain about this but don't realize it's for the benefit of the guests as well as keeping high standards for their Ramen."}
{"text":"Less than a month and we came back--that chirashi was calling my name! On this visit, we had a truly excellent server (unfortunately I didn't catch her name) but our disinterested server from our previous visit was just a few tables away. They seem to have done away with the the towel service (or at least we didn't get one), and this time, water arrived quickly and was refilled promptly.

Thanks to Ran's recommendation, we tried the nasu shigiyaki--SO GOOD. There are a lot of different flavors going on--sweet and salty miso, something spicy (possibly togarashi?), and meaty chicken, in addition to the surprisingly nice-textured eggplant. I pretty much only like my eggplant skinless and deep-fried, so this was a revelation (okay, it's still pan-fried). I was already looking up recipes for this while (husband was) driving home.

Chirashi was still good--the cut on some of the fish seemed a little uneven but the place was packed so perhaps there was more rushing than on our first visit. We also tried a few more robata items--the chicken thigh & scallion was great, but the pork belly was underwhelming. We also tried the pork gyoza, for which we have high standards as we make our own. The filling was well-seasoned, but the dipping sauce had a large slick of sesame oil on top which overwhelmed the flavors. They came with the attractive circle of lace from pan flour, a nice crispy addition. They stand up to ours, and are definitely above the caliber of most Pittsburgh gyoza.

Our wonderful server informed us that a new menu is rolling out the first week of July (I think Tuesday?), so I expect we will be back again fairly soon!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this all you can eat sushi. The quantity was pretty nice and the slices of salmon we ordered was t h i c c. The all you can eat is pretty cheap for two people which comes out to be $57 something including tips. I really like their rolls too. I would recommend this place to anyone who's a sushi lover! I promise y'all won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here for dinner since I was craving noodle soup. This hit the spot and satisfied my craving! Delicious Japanese Ramen!!!! Especially for AZ/Tempe!!! Definitely the best ramen in this state. Will surely be back for more! Make sure you ask for the spicy version since it's not on the menu and get pork belly and roasted garlic so the broth becomes more flavorful! I also ordered the soft egg with mine because I love eggs!"}
{"text":"Thank you for opening Umami!  When people find this hidden ramen house, its going to be busy all the time.  Thankfully when we arrived today, we got to enjoy the entire place to ourselves!  It was around 4:00pm and we were greeted by a lovely woman, a wonderful spirit, super welcoming and with a warm the heart kind of smile.  I felt truly welcomed by this person.  She gave us a little introduction about the place and let us choose where we wanted to sit.  They have plenty to choose from!  You walk thru the front door into the bar area with a large bar and tables with high bar stools with a television.  To the left of the bar you walk into the dining room area.  This area is painted lively colors with green chairs and origami on the rafters...(soon there will be local artwork hanging/painted on the walls - I asked, its true!).  To the right of the bar is a smaller room, they call the quiet/tea room.  It is a small, comfy room with dim lights and a zen atmosphere; a place I would love to come to read a book or study.  The restrooms are located past the tea room.  And there is also a large outside area with picnic tables.  

We chose Umami because we love ramen, its walking distance from our home, it would be a new experience for us, and to finish a book my love and I have been studying.  It was perfect.  The woman who greeted us and waited on us for our visit, was so so so nice and wonderful!  Her name was Paula!  I hope all of you that visit Umami, get to enjoy Paula as well!  She was very thorough with explaining our options and then promptly returned with our hot tea and water.  We ordered miso soup and she took our order slips for the ramen.  The miso soup came right out, almost as fast as ordering it.  It was very flavorful with little bits of tofu and sliced scallions.  We began reading and taking notes on our book and soon enough before I even finished my soup the ramen was at our table!  We ordered rice noodles with vegan broth, tofu, kimchi, garlic, and corn.  There was also spinach leaves and bamboo shoots in the bowl.  Huge bowls of ramen noodles loaded with glorious veggies!!! AAAAAAA! In heaven!

I must admit we were there for a couple hours.  Relaxing, really loving the quiet and peaceful atmosphere.  Paula was great.  She was excellent with checking in on us at the right times and leaving our table with a smile.  We chatted a bit about the restaurant, asking about if it was always empty around this time of day.  She said lunch is busy but during the mid afternoon hours, not to much traffic.  In the evening it picks up around 6 or 7pm.  Umami is fairly new, only being open since September, making this a secret spot for most .  Especially since its not really on Mill Ave or 6th St.  
Well, let my review be the deal breaker, for you must visit Paula and Umami!  Give this place some love because it needs to stay around for a long time!  Such a wonderful, little loving ramen house that is away from the busy bodies on Mill Ave.  Its like a little oasis.

Thank you Paula for being such a beautiful person!"}
{"text":"Location = awesome, its a side door and up some really cool stairwell with some great painted art on the walls 
Food = Ramen = on point and delicious"}
{"text":"We live just around the corner and when I saw LOBSTER RAMEN on the menu I knew we had to go. 
     The lobster ramen is SPICY but friggin delicious. I had the chashu ramen and we had tempura vegetables to share. We got seated right away, and the service was exceptional. They were attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was delightful the food was tasty and the people were excellent. 
     I was so full I couldn't eat another bite. I did however notice a strawberry champagne cake... which I will return for."}
{"text":"If you watch the first season of  \"Mind of a Chef\" on Netflix, you get to follow David Chang, founder of the Momofuku eateries in New York city around on his culinary adventures. One place he visits is Japan and one food he talks about a lot is ramen. I've been to Japan myself, and have eaten a lot of ramen there and I have to tell you, the folks at Umami make some good ramen!

They are still in the pre-opening stage of things, without their full ensemble of items. Tonkotsu, the famous pork bone broth based ramen of the Kyushu region of Japan may not be available till their official opening on the 21st of September. However, they do have my second favorite, the famous ramen with miso broth from the Hokkaido region, and it is good. Now when I say good, I mean that from the noodle down to the broth because you have to start with the noodle!

Noodle and Broth Review

Their noodles are somewhat al dente in that they are cooked but still firm. I did talk with at least one of the owners who noted that they spent six weeks perfecting their noodle recipe and it is actually made by a ramen noodle specialist out in California, to their specifications. All I can say, you can tell the quality when eat the ramen, just as good as anything I've had before in Japan or in the Little Tokyo area of Los Angeles. Oh, and you can get the ramen for take out, they provide the broth and noodles separately so you can combine then when you get home.

As for the miso broth, lovely and flavorful and I did have the pork belly, which is oven roasted and quite flavorful. The things I did not like in the ramen was the spinach (I know, good for me but my ramen can go without) and while the little flower shaped carrot was cute, I don't enjoy raw carrots in my ramen. If they were blanched and then put in the bowl, I think they would be much better.

I did go back a second time with a friend  for dinner and I though the ramen in the miso broth was just as good or better and this time, I got the hard boiled egg which is, at it should be, more of soft boiled egg in the center and it was quite delicious. I also got the pork belly again and though some have mentioned it being cold I thought mine was fine and quite flavorful.

Cocktails

Oh, when I went for dinner they had a bartender doing some fun cocktails and it is interesting they can bring some of the San Francisco style cocktail culture to the mill avenue area. As I like both ramen and a good cocktail I think that would be wonderful. Besides the cocktails they have a nice selection of Asian beers and sake and the owner noted they would be expanding their line of Sake.

Improvements

Hopefully the owners read the Yelp reviews and take suggestions. I hope they move away from the plastic chopsticks and just put the metal cans stuffed with wooden chopsticks on the table. The plastic ones, frankly, are harder to use and for me, not part of the culture of a good ramen place, and I hope they move to the pitchers of ice water like at other ramen places.

The owner did mention Soba Noodles and offering the cold Soba Noodle option,k which is a good idea in Tempe, where a hot bowl of ramen may not be the think on a hot summer day so cool items as an alternative are important.

Summation

2nd time there, still keeping the four star rating as for Phoenix, this is an amazing ramen place and I think it will only get better. I'm looking forward to trying their Tonkatsu ramen in about a week when they have their grand opening, I think it will be fun. Just, as I mentioned, dump the plastic chopsticks and get in the wooden ones, and put the cheap diner style napkin dispensers out as well...they are also, part of that traditional ramen experience. Great place, nice owners, I hope they do well."}
{"text":"Alright, it's time to update my review for this place. And I'm very happy to be able to give them five stars, because honestly they've far surpassed my hopes and expectations. 

I've come here twice in the past month, and both experiences were excellent. They've upped their game, and I'm very happy to see how good their ramen has gotten. Everything is on point, and I've noticed some great improvements. The temperature of their bowls has been consistent, and this was a big issue for me before. I've also noticed that they're doing something really special with the hardboiled eggs- I'm not sure what they marinate them in (the server said maybe dash, but I swear there was a hint of sake there...), but it's an experience in and of itself- well worth adding to your bowl. The chashu is always nice- thin sliced and melts in your mouth but never overwhelmingly fatty. The shichimi togarishi corn is always tasty, adding a nice little pop to the bowl. Both times recently I left feeling satisfied, but not itis-ey, if that makes sense. It looks like they've got a few new offerings as well, and a little bit of a larger menu than what I remember, but honestly I can't pull myself away from their ramen when I'm in the area.

Looking around at their extended seating area, this also looks like a great place to come grab a drink if you're local to the area. 

Long story short- if I lived in Tempe then this would be a place that I frequented *OFTEN*. Pretty much any time that I find myself in the area I'll be heading this way, and looking forward to a tasty bowl of ramen. Every issue that I had with this place, they've addressed, and even though their prices are a *little* on the higher side for a bowl of ramen, you definitely get what you're paying for. 

Good work, my friends. Damned good work."}
{"text":"Drinks: their cocktail menu is good and there are a lot of custom drinks which I appreciate at any restaurant. They do tend to be on the sweeter side and use a little too much fruit juice/syrup. Otherwise certainly strong. 

Food is amazing! The sashimi is fresh and their goat cheese appetizer will blow you away. A must try!! Main courses are light, with unique flavors."}
{"text":"I had no idea Ramen could be so tasty - especially after being disappointed by a nearby restaurant with 'Ramen'  in it's name.

Umami's bowl of deliciousness has magical healing powers. I'm serious - this stuff probably cures cancer. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"This was pretty awful.  I had the spicy tan tan men with pork belly (supposed to be crisp in s good way), roast pork and garlic paste.  The broth felt like salt sludge and wasn't spicy like it said.  The roast pork was almost substance-less and got lost in the broth, with no pieces large enough to pick up with the chopsticks.  The pork belly was neither juicy nor crispy--more just hard and stale-tasting.  A waste of nearly $16 ($20 including tip). I did tip well, as the service was great and friendly and the ambiance was nice, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really great food, and great service. Food came out hot right away. Most defined coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere.  Good variety of choices.  Friendly staff.   The food was mostly excellent.  A bit more time could have been spent between courses.   Overall great flavors and portion sizes."}
{"text":"So good!!!  Definitely coming back to this place.  Service was very attentive.  And the salmon avocado roll was amazingly fresh."}
{"text":"Umami-you're doing it right.

Excellent experience on a Saturday night at Umami. Loved sitting with a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. Food came out super speedily: shrimp tempura ($10, huge shrimp! different breading than expected but still pretty tasty), chirashi ($18, so fresh! loved the roe and flower decoration and especially the quail egg), miso deviled eggs ($6, tasty but nothing to write home about), and...drumroll please...nasu shigiyaki ($10). It was the surprise highlight of our meal. Delicately spiced minced chicken filled it and paired wonderfully with the softness of the cooked eggplant. It was sweet and savory and once; my dining partner and I both agreeed we would get it again. 

All cocktails we tried were well-balanced! 

The vibe was high-end/classy without being pretentious. You could definitely bring a date here. It would set the mood well. 

We will definitely be back another time to try more items on the outstanding menu!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a sushi spot like this in Vegas. Amazing food and ambiance.. it was our first time so they gave us a strawberry champagne cake"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is decent but my table was super sticky/tacky. I don't think the restaurant is the same as when it first opened. I received 2 laminated menus. One was for AYCE sushi stuff and a smaller one with a few bento box combos, ramens, and udons. Nothing looked really good so I played it safe with a shrimp tempura udon. The order came out with tons of rough chopped and chunked green onions when I asked for none. After I painstaking took them out, there were 2 sad tempura shrimp, 1 slice of fish cake, and a piece of fried tofu cut in half. The broth was typical udon you get from mixing water and the udon concentrate. The udon was cooked okay but had a lot of broken pieces like on the bottom of a package. There wasn't a lot of udon either. I'm rarely on this side of town and I'm rarely eating alone but I had a few hours to kill and wanted to try this place because it was newer and I used to live on this side of town when there weren't a lot of restaurants. My server clearly saw me picking out all the green onions and she even repeated no green onions when I ordered, but she never said a word after. I paid my $11 plus tip and I'll be trying a different place next time."}
{"text":"The food was okay. It kind of took a little while and then when it arrived, it wasn't as hot as it should have been. It was kind of salty. And it was expensive!!! My boyfriend and I each got a bowl and it ended up being $33 including tip. After everything, it wasn't terrible, but I don't think I will be returning back."}
{"text":"Been 3 times and will continue to go back. Each time we try new rolls and have yet to be disappointed. They of course have all the basics but their signature rolls are so unique. Service has been impeccable. Restaurant is clean and looks great."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! We have ordered from Unami 3 times and each time has been perfection! The food is delicious. The rolls are packed and just so good. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. We have only ordered for pick up but I can't wait to dine in. They're very reasonably priced. This is our new favorite and go to Sushi place. I can't say enough great things about them! Thank you Unami!!!"}
{"text":"No doubt the best ramen noodles in Arizona.
Love the patio, ramen, pizza and bar food selection too!"}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect walking in but I was beyond impressed with the ambiance, the service, and the FOOD. I appreciated that the vegetarian options were highlighted in green on the menu. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm not a big fish person. Japanese cuisine is mostly seafood but Umami offers a lot of other options. The food isn't something that you could make on its own, my tofu rice bowl was LEGIT. I will definitely be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Service is awesome and the food is DELICIOUS! It's close to the house! Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"I must say I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the miso broth pork bowl and it was lacking in flavor. I got the normal pork, not the pork belly and it was quite fatty. 

A flavorless greasy bowl for $10 bucks will not entice me for a return visit."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself to be a ramen connoisseur by any means. However, having tried most of the ramen options in the Tempe area, I feel confident that Umami is the best. From their prices to their fresh ingredients, I was consistently impressed. Their Their Spicy Tan Tan Men broth was exceptionally favorable and packed a decent punch on the spice factor. Their soft boiled eggs were boiled just perfectly. My meal was so large that I was able to enjoy the rest for lunch the next day. The only complaint I have is that while their seaweed salad bento box was delicious, it was far too small. Aside from that, can't wait to come back! #greatwintereats"}
{"text":"You have to know what you're looking for to find it, like all things in life.

The door is around the corner from a large bar, with a sign that's more of a Japanese stamp than indicator of what's within.  You must be able to climb 2 flights of stairs (not ADA friendly at all), and as you go up the narrow stairs, you feel transported to a Shinjuku nightclub. 

It's loud and the dj's at the end of the bar are skilled. So loud that I couldn't hear the hostess or my waitress, but they are willing to get up close and talk right in your ear. They only have high tops, which I always hate because the angle makes my feet dangle and my thighs fall asleep. But...

Their food is extraordinary. I over ordered because I couldn't decide. They had a thick okonomiyaki filled with big chunks of pork and broccoli- unusual filling for traditional okonomiyaki, but delicious. There were fat slices of grilled eggplant topped with ground chicken that were creamy and fresh in the best ways. Personally I thought the eggplant was a bit thick to deal with given that the chicken was juicy and the whole thing difficult to eat with chopsticks, but it was so good flavor and presentation wise. The outstanding winner for me was the delicate egg custard, savory and mushroom filled. It reminded me of a superb homemade silky tofu with lots of flavor in that creamy little pot.

Overall they have a great chef in the kitchen, and a warm, thumping vibe in front."}
{"text":"The food there is not authentic Japanese street food at all. Takoyaki is 50% empty inside with little dried bonite on top. The rice ball is smaller than normal but super pricy for $5-$6 per piece. Fried chicken is the worst even not considering real Japanese food standard. The chicken is pre-cooked and over-fried with too much flour. If you tried fried chicken at Chaya, you'll definitely feel the difference. Even teppanyaki Kyoto is much better than this place. It's definitely cheating to label itself as a Japanese izakaya. Pls visit any Izakaya in New York for a real Japanese dining experience."}
{"text":"I have never had a Ramen bowl before until a few weeks ago when I first tried Umami. After my first experience, I was hooked. The first time I got the paitan broth, but it was a little heavy for me so the second time I tried the miso broth with chicken, soft egg, butter, and garlic. It was delicious! It is also very filling and I left full. I haven't tried their drinks other than the cold drip tea which was really refreshing. The sake drinks look interesting and will be trying those soon!"}
{"text":"It's easy to overlook pricier sushi options when Vegas is full of All You Can Eat sushi places but if you could just tear yourself away from those places for one night, this place will remind you what if feels like to treat your taste buds to something of true quality. Not only is the fish fresh and far superior to any buffet style eatery out there but there is sincere thought put into every dish from the presentation to the sauce. Even the simple edamame appetizer is exploding with flavor. The chef here tastes pride in his work and it shows. You can't go wrong getting any of their sushi but if you want to try their other dishes, the Chilean Sea Bass is worth every penny."}
{"text":"My friend and I made reservations for 9:15, arrived at 9:08, were seated, and left at 9:38 after being blatantly ignored by the servers. We were never given drinks, let alone a chance to order anything. I will not be returning due to the incredibly rude staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful service great food super, jelly sake , salmon cama delicious. Red bull roll unique!"}
{"text":"Go here.  Go here.   Go here.   Go here.  
If you're a west coast sushi snob, go here. 
If you're an adventurous foodie, go here
If you're hip, not hip, business, go here
The service, atmosphere, decor are all pretty awesome 
But the food is some of the best Japanese fare I've had.

So 

Just
Go 
Here

{"text":"2/5 for great people working there, and the friendly vibe you get just walking in the door. BAM, smells like a pickling factory but do not fear, the bar area looks fun. Our experience was bad however-- the noodles in our ramen were cooked Al Dente, and you know what that means once an amalgam of them begins to expand in your stomach. They definitely weren't cooked all the way, so thus, I felt like I was going to LITERALLY lose my food after I finished a relatively small bowl. Yeah, I'm a small person, but you know, I can still eat! I just felt so sick afterwards.

The spinach- strange & refreshing.
The carrots- lovely.
The pork- cold, but good.
The nori- you know, your standard nori.
The broth- yeah, a little salty, but good. We tried the Pai Ton, the tonkotsu broth without the Pork ordeal.


But the noodles! They made me so sick, and I really want to love this place because their ramen is so diverse. After the meal, one of the friendly staff members made us some little non-alcoholic shots, so like I said-- SUPER NICE people! I just can't handle their style of food, it doesn't agree with me at all. If you're sensitive like me, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe-- they'll be a more classic and authentic option for you. 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am happy with the new location of this place! Very fun vibe when you walk in and love how big it is. I tried the tan tan men ramen with a soft boiled egg, pork belly, spam, and seaweed. Delicious! Everything I would want in a ramen bowl. However, the broth is just a little too salty to my taste so that would be the only negative. I'll still come back to enjoy a bowl of ramen with some friends any day though :)"}
{"text":"Nice hidden restaurant about the stairs. Great ambiance.
The udon that's on the menu is actually yakiudon and was not clearly explained to me by the waiter. Service was okay, a bit slow. People kept trying to give us dishes that weren't ours. (We should have taken it but we were trying to be righteous.) 

The okonomiyaki is OK. Felt pretty undone, but liked the sides and how it was really warm. 
Tonkatsu udon was also OK.
The udon was meh. I would not recommend tbh.
Pricing is OK, everything is just A-OK. 

Note: Everything is pretty salty."}
{"text":"I've been to Umami twice now and both times I got the ramen with the spicy broth and added in the pork belly (which you should try). I've had ramen plenty of places and I'll say that this is up there for me as some of my favorite. The broth is super rich, balanced out by a good dose of saltiness. The ingredients are perfectly proportioned too. The only negative for me is the spinach and seaweed. They sort of clash with the rest of the bowl for me. I'll just ask them to leave them out next time. 

Service has been great too! It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great local spot close to the providence neighborhood. Customer service and food spot on."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place so much it is our Go to place for special occasions.  We just had our anniversary dinner there last weekend which was wonderful: sat right up in front at the picture window table: great for people watching!  My wife had the curry chicken with black rice.  The serving side was large and I got to finish about half of her dinner.  I had the salmon and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that this place is definitely better than Republic Ramen, but it is not traditional Japanese style ramen. If anyone has ever been to Little Tokyo or Shin-Sen Gumi in California then pretty much anything else will disappoint you. They have different flavored broths to chose from but I opted for the Tan Tan which is in their \"hidden\" menu. Thank god I ordered that because it supposedly is the most flavorful soup (which was good but eh). We waited such a long time for our soup and their was barely anyone in the restaurant. When the food came out the noodles were undercooked and my egg was still cold in the middle and I noticed they used sweet corn in their broth (nooooooooooooooooo). My bamboo didn't taste very good so I left it in my bowl which was very unfortunate. I give them 3 stars for at least having tasty broth and friendly service but if I ever came back I would have to make some adjustments. On a good note, they did give us 20% off our bill for having to wait so long. 

*side note: please get rid of that cucumber water....it tasted sour as hell. I'd rather just take water from the tap."}
{"text":"So I assumed it would be like every other sushi place, I was wrong. This was by far the best sushi I have had in Las Vegas and the service was perfect as well. Prices are good too. 10% off for Active military and police. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure what I ate, but it wasn't ramen, that for sure.  Might give it another try, i usually give all spots a 4th"}
{"text":"This placed has changed to an AYCE sushi joint.  The food was ok, but did not seem as fresh as other local sushi restaurants.  The service was excellent.  We preferred the old menu selections."}
{"text":"I'm currently waiting for my takeout order. It's been 40 minutes & I still haven't received the two sushi rolls I ordered. The hostess is nice & apologized, said the chef said 4mins. That was 13mins ago."}
{"text":"Umami, is a small hidden gem located on mill avenue. What you'll find you'll never know! But right where you enter you'll a cool bar, you'll think of it as a coffee modern bar, but there's lounges the bathrooms are nice and before you enter is a huge mirror out front for a whole body selfie including wall chalk art behind you. Other than the cool interior, with bright neon colors and bright wall art you'll definitely enjoy eating here! For a good meal you'll most likely spend under 20 dollars which is really good! They definitely meet the college needs with ramen with the price but you can't beat it! Specially with the unique tastes and broths make it a ramen bowl you'll want to try over and over again! You also have choices to customize and add things to your bowl, drink specials are available and also a happy hour! Service is awesome and small so you won't lose yourself in forgetting about them or vice versa! This is my go to spot in Tempe for ramen and I would say in the Phoenix valley area! So stop by! Enjoy Kompai!"}
{"text":"Walking in this place feels like it should be on the strip , thankfully it's not. I love the upscale feel with out having to deal with the tourist and going downtown. We were seated almost immediately and the waitress went over the drinks and made some recommendations. The menu is simple and not overwhelming. They have your topical rolls and Nigiri with a nice number of restaurant specific rolls. 

We went with a nice mix of rolls and nigiri. The food came out in a timely manner spread out few rolls at a time. ( I have been to some restaurants where they dump your whole order at once and it's overwhelming).  The presentation of the food was nice . The food was delicious , everything was fresh and great portions of fish , no ingredient was overwhelming.  I highly recommend the Vegas roll and the Sammon nigiri. 

The cost for a NOT ALL YOU CAN EAT restaurant was fair , not to expensive and good value. I think our bill for 2 people with beer and about 4 rolls and 2 nigiri was around $65. 

My 2 down sides ( still not worth dropping to a 4 star, they bugged me but the wife thought I was being crazy ). The front door has a bell on it when it opens , it drove me crazy lol. 
Second,  soda you get a can , I just hate it it's $2 for a soda and you bring me a can ,  makes me feel like wtf I just paid $2 for a can ahahaha. ( the food still over powers this complaint )"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The ordering style of order as you want things was very relaxing - especially with how fast the kitchen operates. Excellent sake selection and the whole menu is inspiring from appetizers all the way to dessert. I highly recommend the vegetable gyoza."}
{"text":"Hipster ramen house. Dont come if your expecting good food, but the decor is cute. Very short menu. Everyone in my party had the same issue with their food: SUPER SALTY. A lot of MSG as well. We had to water it down to make it somewhat enjoyable. 2 stars for cleaniness,decor and average staff. Would not come again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and very much enjoyed it. It is near ASU, so that's the primary clientele. The noodles were very good. We added four or five ingredients and it was tasty and filling. They were out of half the beers on the menu, but we ended up with some good beers. Not a high end spot, but a good spot for the money. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my current favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! My friends and I got a Friday night reservation for two weeks ahead since this place is always booked. Expectations were high and Umami didn't disappoint. We ordered a variety robatayki for starters which are small pieces of grilled meats/veggies. My favorites were pork belly and Japanese eggplant. We also ordered a special sushi of the day which was good. For drinks I had Japanese beer which I liked. But the best thing we had was the mind-freaking miso ramen which was the best ramen I ever put in my mouth. If there's anything that I have to go back to - it's that, because I have started dreaming about it.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and was BLOWN AWAY! I ordered the skate and it was absolutely phenomenal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Booked this restaurant for my birthday dinner after I read about it in Scene magazine.  Our waiter was really knowledgeable about all of the specials and I appreciated that he took the time to answer all of my questions.  He definitely gets 5 stars.
Food: we ordered the scallop appetizer and green beans. The scallop app was perfect. I would have preferred a touch more heat to the dish, but it was tasty.  Green beans were delicious, and the vinaigrette reduction was sweet, but not overly so.  For entrees, husband got the elk and I had the nairagi. The dishes were beautiful, but the temperature was warm at best. My dish seemed as though the chef was afraid of a touch of salt. Lovely plating, but just mediocre flavor.  For dessert we shared the chocolate pot de creme with cherry whipped cream. That was a to-die-for dessert. We each had two cocktails and an espresso. The espresso with dessert was perfect.
Ambiance: lovely, quaint and a little tight. Wish it was a touch bigger space, but still a lovely restaurant.
I would eat here again for a special occasion as it is a bit on the pricey side. Total bill: $150."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating at Umami, and I must say it's the closest I've gotten to great Japanese food since I moved back to the states from Japan."}
{"text":"Brought my father and son here for lunch on a weekday simply because it was conveniently located near the Centennial Medical Offices. What a great find. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish we ordered and the staff was extremely friendly. When in the area, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try.  We sat at the sushi bar and they sushi chef was so nice. The uni is melt in your mouth goodness.  I came for the live lobster but they were out from the weekend so we'll def be back again soon."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Enjoyed it. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food but it was Plenty. Was not that impressed with noodles but the taste was good. With extra meat and noodle the price point was a bit high for lunch but I think I could have been full on just the normal portion."}
{"text":"Seriously our new favorite sushi spot- I don't care what side of town you live on; it's is well worth the drive to experience the amazing freshness and modern environment.  The menu is simple clean and straight forward, no 30 minutes of reading and items blurring together because there so much listed- just simple quality fresh designs with quick turnaround and great presentation.

Again- worth the drive, maxing quality, great presentation, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to open up in the North West.  I've been to the local sushi spots around this area and have been disappointed many times.  However, Umami fits the bill in so many ways that I have to give it 5 stars.  I only hope that the quality stays high.

We are regulars and we have tried so many things already on the menu.  The things my wife and I love:

- Sushi & Sashimi Platter - Beautiful design, high quality fish, assortment of pickled sides.
- Shoyu Raman - Pork broth is slow cooked all day and isn't super cloudy.
- Short Ribs - Flavorful but not just slathered with sauce.  Beautiful marinade.
- Taco Wasabi - Raw Octopus with Wasabi sauce, its an acquired taste but they do it well!
- Tempura - Nice and Crispy!
- Number 5 Roll - Albacore Tuna, Spicy Tuna, and the best part fried onion rings!
- Strawberry Champagne Cake - Delicate and savory
- Tempura Ice Cream - Duh, it's just awesome!

The service is top notch.  They've only been open for 2 weeks and I've already spoken to Chef Jun and the Restaurant Manager several times.  They care about what you think and communicate with you because they want to know what they did well and how they can improve.  The wait staff is friendly but you can tell this is a little new to all of them.  Nevertheless, I always felt attended to.

The establishment is a reflection of a more high-end sushi bar that might be near the strip.  On the far wall from the entrance is a huge painted mural of samurai.  If you're a sports fan they also have large screens playing all the games.  One of my favorite parts this the music they play.  They have a mix of downtempo and upbeat instrumental hip hop.  

If you are in the area or live near I definitely recommend coming here.  I'm so happy to have a Japanese restaurant that has both sushi and ramen."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Now it's just another all you can eat sushi joint with bland fish and thick sauces to cover it up."}
{"text":"So... was the trip out to Umami for ramen worth it? Well, yes and no. It was head and shoulders above anything I've had locally. However, they still have a few laps around the ramen kettle to go. I spoke with several people there. They had just opened up the Friday before. They also plan a more ambitious menu (including tempura and katsu!) but.... I ordered the pork belly ramen. When it arrived the pork was STONE COLD! As if they had just grabbed a few slices out of the fridge and dumped it into the bowl. YIKES! Even after letting it sit for a while in the broth (which turned the whole bowl luke warm), not a good thing for the notion of \"comfort food\". This place needs to gel a bit more and maybe a visit a few months from now might get better results."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I love the food, location, atmosphere and service!! If you love ramen this place is a must."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, and great pacing. We ordered and ate as we went which was a nice change of pace. The stairway up to the restaurant was a bit confusing, but loved all the artwork in the darkened halls.

Food:
Our favorites of the evening were the Okonomiyaki (savory pancake) and the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle bowl. The flavors and textures were so spot on. We also enjoyed the spicy tuna, scallion, nori rice ball. The vegetable tempura was good and made well, but will probably opt for something else next time. We got pork gyoza last, and for a moment were hoping it got lost in the fray because we were getting full and it had been awhile since we ordered. We liked the cooking technique, which looked like the dumplings were flattened, but I felt the gyoza were very overseasoned, and the saltiness was even more pronounced when tried with the dipping sauce.

Drinks:
We each tried some sake. One hot sake, and a Falling Petal -  a cold draft sake shot infused with Hibiscus. Both were equally enjoyable, with Falling Petal slightly winning in how refreshing and fun it was with the Hibiscus.

The Tickle 'n Giggle with Pop Rocks, Leblon cachaça, basil, coconut lemongrass nigori, lime was fun and delicious. I could not quite figure out how to get the pop rocks into the drink, so I asked our server and she kindly explained how she drinks it. I poured some of the pop rocks on top, which jumped back in my face, and then stirred a few in which complimented the drink throughout the meal. 

The  Fairy Tail with cava, sweet potato shochu, beet, ginger, lemon, cardamom bitters was refreshing and visually striking with the beet garnish."}
{"text":"The decor is really nice! The sushi is good. The ramen on the other hand bland! Same with the shrimp udon on the lunch menu. I'm glad I can say I tried it but I prefer sushi loca, kabuki, or sushi fever so I wouldn't come back. service was ok. Overall I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at shady park was nice and chill. It was nice enough to sit outside at this time of the year. $1 sake bombs with a food purchase is a great deal, although they are pretty small, but I am not sure if there is a limit to how many you can order (we got 2). 

We got the paitan ramen with corn. The broth was a mix of good and bad, the broth was rich but it didn't leave a fatty feel in your mouth. The flavor profile has a strong finish, but was handicapped by the initial salt assault. We diluted the saltiness with some chili oil and mystery spice on the table. And this is without any meat added to the dish, which usually makes it more salty from the meat runoff. For $9 + $0.50 for the corn, you don't really get much. you get 1 carrot flower, 1 measly naruto, 1 small piece of seaweed, 2 pieces of bamboo shoots, some spinach and surprisingly a good helping of corn. Nothing really outstanding for the price, could get a better value meal/ ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious! I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is really good. Big screen tv which made it a great place to watch the basketball games. Menu has changed since the picture posted on the yelp review. I was disappointed to see that they didn't have a roll I wanted. However, everything my friends and I ordered was delicious. Really fresh fish and very flavorful sauces. I will definitely come back here again. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and food is great."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time tonight. It was my 8 year olds birthday! He's a sushi lover! I called at 6:30pm and asked if there was anyway we could have a table for 9 around 7:00pm. The employee on the phone was very nice and said she would try to figure something out. When we got there they had a beautiful table set up to fit all 9 of us comfortably. The service is some of the best I have had in a  sushi place we never had empty drinks and the food kept on coming. The food was also amazing the sushi was all fish hardly any rice. Some of the best sushi we have had. At the end of our dinner they brought the birthday boy a beautiful dessert and sang to him. He loved it! Thank you so much for making my boys 8th birthday amazing. I wish I could give you guys 10 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi bar this side of town.

That being said, I wish they were a bit more traditional with their cuts.  Everything seems to be cut much thicker than it should be, notably their chashu and their sashimi.  I would much prefer having thinner slices and more pieces."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was great and I loved the atmosphere.
Way too hot in the restaurant! We were sweating the whole time we were there. Also, they were out of sushi rice when we were there so we were disappointed that we could not get sushi."}
{"text":"Second time making my debut here, and I have got to say it's just as good. The service was great. This guy gave me double sake flight. I am hooked on the Black and Gold! I am proud the chef came out to tell us about the new miso vegan soup bases. I will come back and try.  Also their take out is very cute boxes that seem structurally sound for the tranport of ramen."}
{"text":"They say a house divided will surely fall, and that too many cooks will spoil the broth; but it is clear Umami will endure. Long live the spirit of this fine cuisine! 

Also the vegan shio is so amazing."}
{"text":"There are a few obstacles to getting into Umami, including finding the door (follow the lanterns up the stairs and keep climbing!) and getting past the frosty hosting staff, but make the effort and you're on your way to an awesome experience! The maguro was deliciously spicy and the suzuki was succulent! The yuzu deviled eggs are also a fine addition to your dining experience as is the takoyaki, with both being presented beautifully by a great wait staff. There are always fantastic specials and it's great to watch the sushi chef slice and dice at the bar with an ambience on par with the high quality of food, beer and wine! The chirashi is also a standout of mixed sushi selections! The staff does a great job of describing the sushi and fresh fish being delivered to the table and the presentations are really quite ornate! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time I excused the slow service. Second time after being open a month I do not. We've been here 20 minutes and no drink/no food. Regardless of how the food is, customer service is required for 5 star.

Edit** the service can use work as previously stated, but the food was amazing. I prefer food quality over service any day.  I'll keep coming back and recommend this."}
{"text":"Went to their NEW location which is around the corner. My husband raved about their ramen at the original location, well he took me here and let's just say I went to in-n-out afterwards. The broth was not good at all, the garlic paste was slapped on the bowl and dripping into the broth. The flavor was kit there at all! And I love Ramen!  My husband said it was not the same . I ordered a shrimp tempura sushi roll for back up and when I got it the middles of the shrimp were completely raw and the smell was soooooo strong of fish, I had to tell the waitress to take it back. The new location is very nice BUT the food definitely needs some improvement :/"}
{"text":"The menu selection and creativity is brilliant. The chef is truly a food artist. My palate was fulfilled with nothing but pleasure. Tasty morsels of pleasure.  This gentleman, who is the mastermind behind the gastronomy talents of Unami will soon be recognized as one the areas most talented chefs."}
{"text":"After following Umami through its many pop-up events, I am very excited that it is finally open!  Even more delightful is its wonderful, very authentic atmosphere. Upon entering, I immediately felt transported to a true Izakaya experience. Pittsburgh needs more authentic ethnic places like this!

We had not made reservations, but we came at 9:40ish on a weeknight and were able to get seats at the kitchen-facing counter bar. The hostess was gracious, and we received impeccable service all night from our server Sheryl.  It was super fun to watch the chefs working. As someone who is obsessed with food and cooking in all forms and watches lots of shows/documentaries involving professional chefs, I was pleasantly surprised.  These chefs really know what they are doing.

The hot towel they give you in the beginning is a really nice touch, and we enjoyed some cold sake with our meal. My partner got the tuna sashimi and the Nasu Shigiyaki and thought both were delicious. Apparently the Nasu Shigiyaki, which is half of a japanese eggplant pan-fried and topped with ground chicken and an incredibly delicious sauce, is a staff favorite.  Well, let me tell you, the staff have good taste. It is a dish that you might overlook on the menu, but it is awesome!  I was impressed.

I got the ramen, and while it's one of the better bowls of ramen you can get in Pittsburgh, it was a bit on the salty side, the char siu was excessively fatty, and the bamboo shoots were uninspiring.  The egg was done perfectly, though.  Overall, I enjoyed the ramen at the Umami ramen pop-up a lot more, so this was the only (very slight) disappointment of the meal.

We will definitely be returning to try some of the other food here!"}
{"text":"I try to use Yelp only as a tool to find restaurants near me, because I think it's generally unfair to the establishment and staff (most patrons have no idea how a restaurant actually works, so unless a server is actually blowing a snot rocket into somebody's food, it's really just some kind of an imagined slight on the part of the customer). THAT BEING SAID: CHECK IT OUT!! We loved Umami, and would most definitely plan on coming back. The food was delicious, the staff was fantastic, and I thought it was reasonably priced.

From the moment you walk in, it has a cool vibe. There are stairs, but it's not a big deal. I totally dig the red neon lights, the wall art (sumo wrestlers!) and the bar was spacious (definitely did not expect that considering the space from outside, so a nice surprise!) our group ordered 3 of the signature cocktails, and they were great. I personally would recommend #GodzillaTears. My friends got Ginger Ginger, and a cute cocktail with an ice ball in it, and they thoroughly enjoyed them. 

The quail egg skewer wrapped in bacon was the bomb.com. My friend ordered chicken hearts on a skewer, and she loved it. The sushi and the ramen bowls were excellent as well. 

Give it a try! I loved this place and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in Vegas, and I've been here for almost 2 years. The lemon salmon roll is my favorite. The \"pang\" appetizer was also really good. Honestly, we got a lot of food and it was all fantastic. Service was fast and very friendly. I'm just upset that I didn't start going here sooner!"}
{"text":"Ramen is very good.  Probably one of the best I've had since comming from the Bay Area"}
{"text":"I do have high ramen standards growing up in Hawaii, where there are ramen shops everywhere. I have also had ramen in Japan. Rating is based only on ramen and gyoza. Service was good and ambiance was typical bar setting. Gyoza was deep fried, good flavor but typically only crisped on bottom. Now on to ramen. I ordered miso ramen and added soft egg and pork. Portion of noodles and pork was nice. Broth was sub par, not really any flavor. Pork was shredded pork with not that much flavor as well. Egg was soft boiled but not soaked in Japanese sauce, that gives that brown color and flavor traditionally. I also rate quality based on price. After tip it was a $18 dollar meal. Ramen is cheap but I don't mind paying for quality food and this ramen was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Walked here with my boyfriend. Lovely service and small environment; legit the best ramen I've had hands down. Servers were super helpful and nice without being snobby or condescending like at sushi places in ye olde Snottsdale. Extra garlic if you request it! Cute take out boxes for the soup that snap into place. Leftovers were as godly as the first time I ate the ramen."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon with my friends this past week. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming. I tried a few of their sushi rolls : Big Bang and the Wet dream., both were up to par with most other sushi restaurants. I also had the tempura udon, which was pretty good as well. The customer service was quick and efficient.
Overall the place was pretty good and the price was decent enough to where I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Hard to find but amazing ramen. Best I've found so far in AZ. Recommend the Pork belly and soft egg. Cocktails sound weird but oddly work well."}
{"text":"Walking in, I could tell this place is a Japanese eatery that features ramen, pizza & frozen Kirins! I decided to try their tan tan men with pork belly, togarashi corn, and soft-boiled egg. The ramen was decently spicy and the spicy corn was really good. They also had some good veggies in there! However, their pork belly was not very soft and didn't seem like it was slow-cooked long enough. Their soft-boiled egg was also overcooked and just a hard boiled egg. The noodles were not as good as what I've had elsewhere in the Valley too.

I would definitely return here as the ramen is a reasonable price, but it is not the best quality. I would like to try the other things on the menu as well."}
{"text":"This place serves me a shameless addiction in the form of a soup that is so full of flavor, especially when customized with the help of the friendly and experienced staff or owners/operators that frequently interact with guests, that I constantly crave it.

  Pairs nicely with refreshingly cold japanese beers and authentic appetizers.

  Go and try the ramen soup, as is (each broth has their own strengths) and enjoy the work that is brought by full time attention to the broth creation, and then come back and ask how you can customize it - Warning: your mind may melt.

  Also, fairly empty on week nights and there are three different 'sections' with various ambiances to choose from. A quiet VIP lounge area with dim lighting and nice decor, an inviting bar with plenty of seating, and a dining room area that has great music playing.

(Note: The place, somewhat hard to find the first time around, is one block North of Myrtle and University, park and walk past the parking garage ramp)"}
{"text":"GREAT SPOT!!!!!   Customer service was outstanding and the food was excellent!!  We will be returning again and telling others!!   Thanks again for making our DATE night cool!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome sushi.  The fish was as fresh as you can get. The scallops and salmon sushimi melted in my mouth. Terrific selection of saki too.  Only downside - not a lot choices in maki rolls."}
{"text":"Who writes the review for this restaurant? The food was so awful that my husband I can't eat it! I mean my husband has had dog in china before and he ate that! Way overpriced for crappy food. It was a our first experience there yesterday and I can assure you it'll be our last! Instead of going on about the other crappy part, I'll just leave it as is."}
{"text":"Waited for 5 mins for any server. Place was a ghost town. No one came so i leave them with a 1."}
{"text":"Best vegan ramen in Pheonix (or Tempe). 

I went to their previous location, so I can only comment on the food. I will need to come back again to try out their new spot. 

We came here whenever we were craving ramen while living in Mesa. The broth was flavorful and not too salty, and not boring. I like the topping they put in the ramen and also the option to add whatever else you would like to it. 

If you're vegan and want some ramen, come here. It may not be the best I've ever had, but it's probably the best in the state of Arizona."}
{"text":"This place was great. 

We came here to eat some ramen last Sunday, but I guess they ran out. So we'll have to go back for that.

We ended up trying some sushi, the beef bowl and the baked mussels. 
The Red Bull roll was fantastic. I had the beef bowl because I had already gotten my fill on seafood that day. And it was also very good. The beef was very good and tender with a lot of flavor. The mussells were good, but it had a lot of the mayo sauce. I'm not the biggest fan of that stuff. 

The service here was great. We sat at the sushi bar, and the sushi chefs were very kind and quick to serve. They even offered us a little taste of sashimi. 

We'll definitely be back soon to try out that ramen. You really can't get good ramen on this side of town."}
{"text":"A trendy Japanese spot with many different options from sushi to ramen/noodle dishes to seafood to other izakaya dishes. We got takoyaki, a grilled fish special, udon noodles, and a savory egg custard. All were good, though the fish was very underwhelming and not that tasty for the $18 that it cost - it was accurate in the description given by our server, but we were hoping for more of a miso cod style dish (which is not on this menu - I hope they add it!)

Note that if you go during dinnertime, you'll be surrounded by red lighting. Not ideal for food pornos."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place was amazing. Having tried a different ramen shop in Tempe, I was doubtful since that didn't live up to expectations. But Umami was superb! I got the paitan broth, with chicken and a hard boiled egg (a classic addition). The one thing I would hope to change is how salty the broth is. Can't wait to try different options for my next visit."}
{"text":"Although they have a new menu, the sushi is fresh and beautifully presented. We sat at the sushi bar and it was great to see all the options going out to other tables. 
Finding out they now offer \"all you can eat\" was just an added bonus. 
I really loved how the tools were not drowning in sauce. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"Once again Vegans win...seriously, I was scared going to an asian restaurant (especially Japanese which is fish heavy) in Pittsburgh to try and eat dinner. No need. 

We headed up a month or so ago to test out their ramen as was recommended by a friend. We were sat in front of the bbq area at a bar top. The place was packed. 

The server made it clear that there were more vegan options that what it seemed so she let us know what was up. 

We ordered a ramen dish to share and at least 3 appetizers. All were great. \"Super vegans\" may not like the fact that their food will be cooked on the same surface as fish...there is no vegan side to their kitchen so know this before you go and avoid it if your ethics don't allow you for any kind of cross contamination. 

Service was quick and friendly, the vibe in the space was young and fun. The place is decorated well and is super tightly packed but it works. 

The ONLY downside was that the roof must not be insulated because it was FREEZING in there. We were happy to be sat next to an open fire pit for warmth. We actually avoided going back during the cold snap because we were worried it would be uncomfortably cold."}
{"text":"Alright guys I'm back after this drought of being away from my Yelp Reviews for too long because we'll life struck me down. 

Soooo a decent all you can eat on the NW side of town?! The owners of Hwaro (aka the best Korean BBQ spot around) has taken over ownership! If you like the appetizer, \"the shit\" there then serve you're in luck as they have it here too. We went 15 minutes after 3pm so we got stuck with the dinner price for al you can eat. The menu is large so many plus's to that and the wait staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is fun and cool as well. I'd like to see them busier but hey I was there at 3pm. I would recommend the pang for starts and the kiss of fire! Can't wait to come back here to update this review!! I just had to write one to let everyone know it's under new management and they now offer a lot more options. 

PS
I'd like to see them be more kid friendly perhaps offer some kind of juice for the kiddos and perhaps a kids menu."}
{"text":"Very cool food! Great presentation , simple menu , and the food is tasty. You'll probably enjoy their noodle bowl. You can go all vegan , but they only have alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Very decent ramen place, we parked in the public garage so it was a tiny bit difficult to find at first but we're glad we did. It's not earth-shattering new food or anything along those lines- it's just good, flavorful, and plentiful ramen. My wife and I both had the pork/chicken bone broth, and I added the pork belly, hard boiled egg, and kimchi, while she had pork and corn added to hers. Broth was very full and flavorful without being oily or greasy, and the portions were very generous. When we come back to the Tempe area, I'm sure we'll be back!!

P.S.: Janae (sp?) was awesome!!! : )"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise on the north west side! 

I didn't feel like cooking dinner and was having a sushi craving. I've had this spot bookmarked for quite some time and, as always, I was happy to be able to cross it off the list. 

AYCE sushi is my jam! For reals. If you've read other reviews, a pretty good handful of them are AYCE. What can I say? I like to get down with the get down.

The venue in the same parking lot as BOA,a few doors up from Cold Stone and a few doors down from China A Go Go. It's clean and comfortable, with two large TV's; one is a projection screen. They had the travel channel playing. Good choice, Umami. There were a few tables occupied at 9 PM on a Sunday night but we like to sit at the bar so away we went.

Service was attentive. Drinks arrived first and we placed our order for the kitchen appetizers, which was just one KFC. I didn't really like that my hot tea came in a metal cup because the cup was hot and I had to wait awhile to drink it, so proceed with caution in that department. 

KFC was decent. It wasn't what I expected but it was still good. But I didn't come here for the apps. We order d a few rolls; a veggie roll and salmon avocado roll, the lobster roll, the sashimi roll that's cucumber wrapped. We also ordered the seafood salad, oysters, and a ton of nigiri. 

Our sushi chef was AH-mazing. He was attentive and very very fast. Our rolls were well made. The fish to rice ratio was perfect throughout the meal, especially with the nigiri. I loved my veggie roll. It was probably one of the best I'd ever had. The veggies were crisp and actually had some great flavor. The fish quality here is spot on, too. Taste, texture and smell is of high quality. It really can be touch and go with other places. I was pleasantly surprised!

The real star was the nigiri. The salmon belly and even the regular salmon was so buttery. It just seemed to melt in your mouth. Another favorite was the Cajun albacore. I'm not usually partial to it at other restaurants, but his was unique in that it wasn't overly seasoned. I also loved the lemon and smoked paprika salmon. To be honest, there wasn't a piece of nigiri that I didn't enjoy. And best of all, there wasn't a huge mound of rice underneath. 

It was a great experience overall and I'm really looking forward to coming back and giving some more items a try-- including a few bowls of noodles."}
{"text":"Great service! Super friendly! The staff was incredible and the food was AMAZING!!! If you love sushi give this place a try."}
{"text":"Came in at 2pm to try the ramen combo and I have to say it's a great price for the amount of stuff you get ( salad, 1 roll, and 1 generous amount bowl of ramen ) we ordered another specialty roll cause we didn't think $12 ramen combo would be enough but man I'm coming out stuffed.  Great atmosphere and very attentive server ( sure we were the only ones there haha but I'm guessing since it's a Tuesday and 2pm.  Still this place should get more business it's great ). Will come back again to try some dinner stuff next time."}
{"text":"Yesterday, after a hard day of cleaning, Chris and I ventured out late at night (aka 9) to grab a bite. I have been wanting to go here since I saw reviews popping up for this place. It is close so we made a reservation with open table and got right in.

If you cannot climb steps due to joints/vertigo/anything this is not the place for you. The steps up to the restaurant are steep and you have to go two flights up. It is a warning for those who might not make it. 

This place was thumping for a Tuesday night! I could not believe how packed it was. People were at tables, at the bar, and at the sushi bar! 

The tables are all high tops (eh) with backed chairs (a plus). Our table slightly sloped so that when we moved our water to the right it slid off the table along with my glass. I do not know if the table was sloped, the floor was sloped, or if the table was so waxy that it just slid right off. After that we kept our food and drinks to the left. 

So we started with the bites! These all were grilled on little wooden skewers. It was nice to be able to watch your food being cooked in the open kitchen. 

ROBATAYAKI W/TARE & TOGARASHI:

Japanese eggplant -- Three medallions of eggplant. It was grilled perfectly and had a great taste to it. Chris and I both agreed for $1.5 we would get it again.

Beef tenderloin -- Again about 4 pieces of tenderloin on a skewer. These pieces were really good. The marinade plus the grilling flavor, yum. But the bites were smaller than a bite so while good, probably not again. 

Then we moved to our \"main course\" which I say in quotes because Chris decided he was not going to get a real meal but just dumplings.

YATAI:

Pork Gyoza: pan fried pork & cabbage pot stickers, rayu shoyu. Ok, at first I argued with him about this. I was like, \"this is $8, I could buy a bag for cheaper than that....\" But I was glad that he talked me into it. These were not the usual frozen from a bag from the strip gyoza. These were handmade, delicious, and we ordered two of them. TWO! After Chris devoured one plate he said, \"can we get another?\" I was not about to tell him no. They were fried together into a circle and had thin cut hot peppers that were slightly fried. I only ate THREE dumplings out of the two orders we got. He really enjoyed them. 

Tonkotsu Ramen: pork char siu, bamboo shoots, 5:10 egg, scallion, nori. I am a fan. This was a great dish. I will say that the waiter said it was totally split-able but in my opinion (so take that as you may) it really wasn't. There wasn't enough meat/broth/noodles to get a full split. I mean, I could have had more noodles and broth just for me. 

I really liked it here. It was a little dark so I didn't take pictures, we were seated pretty close to another couple and I didn't want to ruin their night by flashing pictures! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE lunch on a Saturday. Had a pleasant experience. Nigiri have great fish to rice ratio. Fish was fresh and tasty. In addition to sushi, I also ordered the Salmon Kama which is highly recommended. Very juicy and tender and the sauce that comes with it is light and lemony.  Service did not disappoint me either. Constant checkups and drink refills.  

Kudos to the waiter that serviced me, I was a bit inquisitive asking many questions regarding items on the menu. He was very patience with me and answered all my questions with a smile, never appearing he was in a rush. 

All in all, it was a good experience and I will be back with company."}
{"text":"This ramen place was great! I got the Miso Hungry with pork, soft egg and some spicy garlic paste. It was excellent and you get a good sized portion. I would highly recommend going here if you want some tasty ramen! They also offer gluten free noodles too."}
{"text":"Finally a decent ramen place! It's not the best ramen I've ever had but it is the best in the area. I enjoyed their miso ramen. I'll be back again when I get my ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Expensive - $8 for ramen base, any other item costs money. so I bowl of ramen can easily costs $10-12.
Not delicious - I don't taste home-made flavor, it's the same flavor as the packs I can get from Asian market. Small portion - food is for enjoying, however I don't feel this way eating here."}
{"text":"5 stars for decor, service, ambience.  4 1/2 for the food.   Not 100% blown away,  but it was pretty damn good and another good restaurant for Centennial Hills.   As well,  you don't feel rushed to order here,  as I usually do in the other sushi restaurants nearby. The selection for sushi isn't as tremendous as you'd find,  but this place didn't offer AYCE either, which I like,  cuz I don't feel like I need to eat 4 huge servings to make it worth it.   Nonetheless, the sushi was fresh, plated nicely and tasty.  My -1/2 comes only because the Japanese Lasagna came with aLOT of mayo sauce not in the description and tonight no Strawberry Champagne Cake everyone else is raving about.  Had the Affogato and that was good vanilla ice cream with coffee poured on top.   Tasty.  Definitely coming back!! (Table next to us ordered the ramen and that looked sooooooo good!!!)"}
{"text":"This ramen changed my life. And it's changing others. Great change on mill compared to other bars and restaurants. Very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere. Had a take out order and got 2 separate bowls of ramen. Had double noodles and 3 hard boiled eggs with some chicken! Pretty good however little pricey compared to what it could be. Also would hope the online website would be updated from 12/2015 saying it's closed down. Definitely will be back to check the atmosphere and the dining service inside though!"}
{"text":"Once you reach the building that Umami resides in, going up the stairs to the top floor is like an experience. With each flight of stairs that you climb, the wallpaper pattern changes and each design is beautiful. The staircase is a bit narrow and the steps are rather steep but it takes less than 5 minutes to reach the 3 flights of stairs. Once you emerge, the set up is small and cozy with a bar on your left and the kitchen along the length of the restaurant. I really liked the aesthetics of the restaurant and it even translates to the presentation of the food. 

Food and Drink Ordered:
* worth trying

- [Suppai Shoga] : Beautifully presented. Tasted very refreshing and has a strong ginger taste which could be a hit or miss for some people. The foam on top had a lemony taste but I missed some of the other flavors in the drink. 

- [Karaage] : Tastes like the description: fried chicken. The meat was not dry, which was a plus but I've definitely had better. I actually preferred dipping it in the takoyaki sauce rather than the sauce that it was provided with. 

- [Takoyaki*] : Tasted like good classic takoyaki.

- [Robatayaki] : Because we couldn't decide on which robatayaki to order, my friends and I ordered one skewer of the bacon quail egg, chicken heart, and Wagyu beef tenderloin. This appetizer was a bit disappointing because there wasn't any flavor for the chicken heart and Wagyu beef tenderloin. The Wagyu beef was also a bit tough. The bacon quail egg was delicious but it's usually pretty difficult to have a flavorless bacon quail egg. 

- [Chirashi bowl*] : Overall, the taste was good. My friend said that this chirashi bowl was better than the one at Chaya Japanese Cuisine. Some of the fish tasted very fresh but others did not. Not to say that the fish tasted bad but it wasn't phenomenal. I did like the addition of the pipette; it controlled the amount of soy sauce necessary for the fish so that the flavors of the fish weren't smothered. 

- [Tonkotsu Ramen*] : The ramen was very delicious, especially the broth which had a very strong sesame taste if you're into that. The only downside is that the pork ribs were a bit dry.

Would I go back? : Of course! I believe that food should look as good as it tastes and for the most part, Umami hits that mark. I like all the options that Umami provides. Even after ordering five items, excluding the drink, there are so many other items that I wanted to try. This place is really nice to good with friends so that you can try a little bit of everything for a reasonable cost. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because not everything that I ate hit the mark but if I could on Yelp, I would give Umami a 4.5 rating because it was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"We sampled a lot of different things on the menu and everything was outstanding. The sashimi was super fresh, the pork belly was tender, and the surprise winner for me was the beef short ribs egg rolls. My wife raved about the sweet potato & leek soup and loved her salad and her salmon sushi. We live in The Bahamas, but plan to make an annual pilgrimage to Umami!"}
{"text":"I loved the old Umami at the back of the church because of the customization of the menu. The bright ambiance was also a pleasure to be in. Like someone's house.

Reading about how Umami had to fold and then come back, having it combined with Shady Park is a fine alternative.

The ramen was great! It wasn't very traditional, but it was a large portion and satisfied my noodle soup cravings.

I was not a big fan on the seating arrangements or the ambiance. It was also dark, dimly lit and I felt like I was eating in a dive bar that a noodle shop. 

So overall: the food's good but don't expect authentic ramen at an authentic place. It's an awesome venue in general with live music and a divey atmopshere and ironically, people go here for the ramen then anything else."}
{"text":"Pretty good all you can eat sushi place. The menu is (I believe) the same as sushi neko; which is would make sense since they advertise for sushi neko on their actual menu. In any case, food is good. We particularly liked the seared salmon, unagi, Saba, hamachi. I do wish they had more dishes other than sushi like seared pork belly. The ratio of fish to rice is excellent. The quality of fish is good too. The biggest thing is that it's a good sushi place up north. Service was also good. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. Great service. Great prices. Kinda hard to find if u r not familiar with the area but the girl stayed on the phone and walked us thru how to get here. Will Def come back!"}
{"text":"Call before you go. I went at 9:49 pm and they told me the owner was closing it down early. They close at 11 pm, would have been nice to know before driving all the way to the restaurant."}
{"text":"loved it!! Built your own is always winner everybody like different food! the service was great and the food was tasty and it's was my first time and Probably not the last! I tried the bowl With miso broth with the chicken roasted and with the other stuff they put in their.Very nice place love the concept deco and very clean and peaceful:)Bravo J'aDore à la prochaine mes amis!:)))"}
{"text":"Clean, well organized and great quality considering you can get All you can eat. We have been several times now and it's always consistent, nice atmosphere, good music and tv's set up. They have an amazing Tiger and Lisa lisa Roll. The only thing I would suggest is adding more variety in the roll menu, the majority of the rolls are made with crab mix and after a while all the rolls start tasting very similar. Please stay consistent and clean!   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Fresh delicious Fish, Good Prices. Sit at the Sushi bar with Kim, he's a blast."}
{"text":"So I'm a sushi guy....The plates are exquisite. Sashimi were exceptional cuts. My wife hates sushi and thoroughly enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. I recommend the poki appetizer. The pickled ginger was fresh tasting as well. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN HANDS DOWN! 
A friend of mine sent me to Umami after I told him I didn't believe AZ had anything to offer in terms of ramen. Dear God, it was amazing. Spicy paitan has to be my favorite. They're generous with their toppings when you order them, and the preset ramens don't skip out on toppings either. So stoked for Super Umami to be up and running."}
{"text":"Good selection for a family with kids who aren't completely sold on sushi.  They loved the chicken teriyaki and vegetables."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very attentive. We ordered 2 apps, 4 rolls,  two beers, and 2 deserts. Only $75. Would go back and bring friends, enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My brother and I went into Umami a few nights ago for AYCE dinner and it was amazing. We like to try new sushi often but will continue to go to one place in particular because no other sushi place is as good as them. Umami is most definitely as good! This restaurant will be our new sushi spot. The location is perfect and the sushi was fantastic. Good quality, presentation, service, atmosphere, everything. Going back tonight!"}
{"text":"Walking into (or up to) Umami set the tone for what was a completely non-traditional Pittsburgh late night experience.  We went to Umami hoping for sushi, but arrived too late, as they stop serving sushi before the rest of the kitchen closes.  Thankfully, there were so many other amazing small plate options we didn't miss the sushi at all!

The meat skewers were outrageously good...we tried the pork belly, and chicken thigh...and then 3 MORE pork belly skewers as they were on special for the late night happy hour.  Followed by the Takoyaki which was out of this world delicious.  We shared a Ramen bowl, and as recommended by our server ate that delightful 5-10 egg on it's own instead of mixing it in with the noodles.  I literally wanted to ask for a plate of those eggs all by themselves.  Sooo good.  The fried chicken with gravy dipping sauce was good, but at this point we realized our eyes were bigger than our stomachs...clearly a sign that we need to go back!

I loved the atmosphere at Umami for a late night snack.  Dim red lighting, a DJ spinning house music that created a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of \"I almost want to get out of this seat and dance.\"  Our server was wonderful and took time to help us navigate the very unique menu.  My only mark against the restaurant is that it requires patrons to climb two flights of stairs and did not appear to be wheelchair accessible, which means a very close friend will not be able to visit Umami. I hope I am incorrect and that perhaps there is another entrance? That is the only reason for 4 stars...otherwise...I don't have a bad thing to say!  It truly is an authentic experience and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visited again!  I got confirmation - Sushi bar is first come first serve basis.

Tableside tofu - AMAZING.  Get it.  So so good.  Skewers - still phenominal.  Rice ball with tuna - amazing.

You can't go wrong with anything on the Umami Menu.  Go!"}
{"text":"Went to Umami last night with my sister. Was our favorite place until last night when we quickly realized they had now become an AYCE place. FLAVORLESS and poor quality fish, all made ahead. We were so sad. None of the old Ramen dishes are there or original \"designer\" rolls that made them stand out. Original staff gone! The gem we had found now blends in with the rest. Back to Yummy Sushi on Cheyenne and Tenaya we go. At least the fish was fresh. It was just a long drive. Please please Umami, go back to the way it was! You were the best! Were being the key word. Last night was awful!"}
{"text":"Finally, a great all you can sushi bar in Centennial Hills.  No more driving to China Town."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd pay $10+ for ramen, but comparing Umami to Top Ramen is like comparing the best burger in the world to McDonalds - it's a completely different ball game."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Hands down. One thing you must know is that if you wanna go at normal dinner times on a weekend, you must get a reservation. This place is small and very, very popular. 

It is located on top of Round Corner in Lawrenceville. The entrance is around the corner on 38th, pull on the dragon handle and go up the stairs. The bar tends to be pretty busy, but their drinks are balanced and well thought out. I've gone on two occasions, one with another couple, where we ended up sitting across from where the grill is located on the bar. Although it was really neat to see, it was really, really hot. Like so hot, we were switching seats.  The second visit we were in the private room with a large party of 11. 

Anyway for drinks I ended up ordering the Wolf and Cub which is a beer with a side of sake with a dropper of hibiscus syrup. It was delicious. For starters I highly recommend their skewers, and honestly they are so cheap, it is totally worth it. I recommend the bacon wrapped quail egg, the pork belly, the kabucha pumpkin and the meat ball skewers. And yes, I had all of those skewers. Not to mention my husband and I ordered 4 of them. Granted the skewers are small, but pack some incredible taste. Also I had a taste of the savory pancake, which was pretty tasty. It had bacon, cabbage and some other deliciousness, also highly recommend to share. 

For our entree, I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen, which came with a delicious marinated egg. Gotta have the egg... It was a good ramen, but not mind blowing good. Those skewers were.... 

Overall, for a restaurant that has small plates in their menu, this is a total bang for your buck. I love this place and I look forward to more of those meatballs."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Umami is a quaint, small restaurant  on the \"main street\" of Chagrin Falls. Chagrin Falls is this cute, small, quaint town, that has lots of old-town shops and places, and Umami definitely sticks out, as it's a Japanese-American fusion type of restaurant.

Made reservations for a group of 12. Walked in..and felt bad. The restaurant is small, we took up half their seating! :P

Ordered the red lotus as my drink. It.. was okay. I didn't really like the lychee and cranberry mix. 

For the small plate, I ordered goat cheese dumpling. Man, that was a strange plate- I was expecting an ACTUAL dumpling, but small pieces of goat cheese that were marinated, came out...on a bed of warm lettuce and great tasting sauce. I wasn't too happy it wasn't a dumpling, but still, a pretty good dish. My friend next to me had the beet salad. It was actually really quite good! I'm not sure how to rate beets though.

I ordered the curry chicken for the entree. It was good- the rice was my favorite- it was kind of a smoky, black, flavored type of rice-like the type of rice you always fight over, as it's crunchy on the bottom of the pot. I thought the chicken was okay. I mean..it was...just very typical curry chicken. I liked the basil in it.

I enjoyed my friend's dishes- the salmon was done quite well; the udon was good as well, with the beef cooked just right. 

Overall, this restaurant was pretty good. I wasn't blown away by anything, but still, a nice cute spot to grab some fusion Asian inspired food. It was nice too, as the waiter split up our check by person! Man, with a 12 person party? That's hard. Good job.

It's not the most awe inspiring type of food, but still, a cool place to chill and chat. I had a friend who commented that he thought this was a type of place that belonged in NYC. hahha. But yeah, definitely was a good night.... with pretty good food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with reservations at 9:45 pm. Important to note that the sushi part of the kitchen closes at 10 pm, so come before then to try the sushi. There was also a DJ making the atmosphere fun. 

My friend and I started off with the Robatayaki chicken and scallion skewers. It is a little pricey but was cooked well. Would be willing to try more skewers. I then had the salmon Temaki. I had never had Temaki before and enjoyed the freshness of the salmon. The presentation also made it with the pipette of Nikiri sauce. I then had the pork and shrimp shumai which were standard dumplings. My friend had the miso ramen and enjoyed it. Said it was pretty good for ramen in Pittsburgh. 

Finally we had the macaron desert which was a little overpriced for one Mochi and macaron but the presentation made up for it. It was very refreshing and a nice end to the meal. I definitely want to come back and try more of the yatai."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, especially the miso ramen. Nice sake selection. DJ was just getting set up as we left, so I presume they spin some tunes into the night. You lose one star for your pretentious hipster bartenders. I don't like being looked down on while I try to enjoy my dinner; puts my appetite off!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. It's a great mom and pop restaurant. Will come back. A little pricey though"}
{"text":"I went tl this place with an open mind as being a vegetarian you do not have a lot of options these days. But I was pleasantly suprised ad they had couple of options. I ordered vegan noodle soup with spicy corn which spiced up soup by giving it that extra kick. It was really good and emptied the whole bowl in under 15 mins. A good place for vegetarians I would say."}
{"text":"Well we have seen this place on Yelp last night. Looking at all the pictures and reviews. So today we go in and we always start with salmon sushi. Well very disappointed!! The smallest pieces of fish and not the best cut! Like no marbling at all. So we say like other places out here don't have good sushi. So we order a few rolls.  They were ok but for the price it's not worth it! $83 for two people and were at Arby's now filling up! Epic fail!!"}
{"text":"After months of my friend wanting to take me here, I finally caved and checked this place out. If you've been holding out like me, stop... now. This place is fantastic. Hands down the best ramen I've had in Arizona. So many options and if you are feeling adventurous, give the big bowl challenge a shot. Even the house cold sake was good. Why are you still reading this, go check this place out."}
{"text":"It was hot and loud. Almost ok food.  Small portions and took a long time to come back with a small less than satisfying plate of expensive, bland cold noodles.  Never again."}
{"text":"Don't bother going here. There's new owners, the food is gross, the place is empty, and it's expensive compared to other delicious AYCE Sushi restaurants in town. The pictures that are being used are from the previous owners. You'll go there and order something you've seen on here and you get something completely different and tasteless. 

Save your time and money- go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't had ANYTHING here that I haven't enjoyed. The food is phenomenal (especially the Spicy Tuna rice ball), the drinks are on point and the service is always WAY above average. I love the ambiance of the entire place and thoroughly enjoy their choices of djs. The bartenders or some of the friendliest. I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try restaurant. We have been enjoying Umami for over a year and the food has been consistent throughout. They have a great environment and top notch service. The staff know us by name and by our usual order and that's hard to find hear days. Give them an opportunity to show what they do best."}
{"text":"Words can't express how happy I am that this place is here. I'd dined at the restaurant before but felt it was too expensive to get full. Sure the fish was fresh and the service efficient, just no comparison to an ayce restaurant. Now this is an ayce restaurant! I had to fight back tears when I quickly recognized the menu from Sushi Neko. It's my favorite ayce in Vegas. Now I have the wonderful luxury of this place being right down the road from my house. Everything I ordered was exactly like ordering from Sushi Neko. The insane rice to fish ratio, the variety of no-rice rolls, the amazing nigiri sauces, and \"the shit.\" I love the salmon belly nigiri, smoked paprika salmon, super white, scallop, and garlic tuna. The shit and shrimp tempura are favorites too. There's not one bad thing I can say about my visit here. My waiter, Carlos was fun and suggested other menu items he thought we'd like. He was spot on! The service was excellent, many plates brought out and empties taken away. I have found my new sushi place!"}
{"text":"I had somewhat high hopes, and I like their logo, the building and the restaurant design. The service was a bit odd - the server seemed confused, and they were out of some drinks and food. We pushed on and each had a bowl of ramen - mine was pork based with garlic and kimchi - similar to what I've had on Honshu near Korea. It was OK - and certainly nothing like authentic. The edamame was above average. Worried about their survival as Arizona needs ramen shops of every quality."}
{"text":"Just had a quick dinner.  Atmosphere is almost like a sports bar (without the noise) serving Japanese food.  Food maybe towards fusion but it was good.  Will be back to try other plates.  Lighting is an issue if you're a senior citizen (like me) as you cannot read the menu unless you make sure you're seated under direct lighting.  Yes, it is on the dimmer side because of the big screen TVs and the projector.  Pricing is typical of suburban Vegas as I've experienced for the last week as a new resident from LA.  Plenty of parking and among other fine dining in this northwest area.  Looks like this area is the new place to frequent and I can see why."}
{"text":"Sooooo slow.  Over 30 min for soup.  Then one dish was completely wrong.  Very disappointed to see that all of the pork items we came for (roast, belly, cracklins and \"love\") were out.  This will prevent me from driving over just for Ramen again.  Aweful"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  It's deceiving because the windows are darkened.  We almost thought it was closed, but they open at 11 am.  Walking inside was a treat.  The dark interior made it relaxing.  Great acoustic music on in the background.  Sat at the sushi bar.  Hubby ordered the #5 which he loved.  I had the marinated pork ribs with rice.  Also had the house salad & Their ginger dressing was fantastic.  Tasted very fresh.  

Service was impeccable.  The sushi bartender, Jun, was very knowledgeable & super friendly.  Very welcoming person.  

We will be back to try the ramen!!!"}
{"text":"So I was really excited to try this place with my girlfriend!  You walk upstairs and into a beautifully adorned room. People bustling, drinks flowing, open kitchen. The food that we had was good. My favorite was the ramen bowl. 

Here's the thing. For this type of place, you really need a server who will make suggestions, explain things, and ask you what you like, to really give you the full experience. Unfortunately, we explained that we had never been there before and that wasn't enough of a cue for her to explain things. She looked like she just wanted to take our order and not be bothered. As we looked at the menu, she came back and saw that we had several questions, but never made suggestions, and almost made us feel like she was judging us for our questions. 

At the end of the meal she just brought us the bill, and we had planned to stay for a couple of drinks.  Oh well, we just went across the street to Grapperia, where they were happy to explain things and serve us. 

Lackluster experience solely on our server. Prob wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I like this place. It is clean. The wait staff is attentive and helpful. The food is good and the restaurant is pretty."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious. Staff is on top of their game. Really like the presentation of the food, ambiance, and service. Highly quality food at the very 'normal' price range. Can't go wrong with these guys!"}
{"text":"Umami is place that I'd like to return to after a pleasant initial visit. It's fun how the location is tucked around the corner from Butler on 38th and having to navigate the unassuming doors and hallways that go up into the restaurant. I'm confirming that the stairs can be a bit much such as if you have knee problems and if there are other people going in the opposite direction as they are narrow but I did ok. Because Umami is an izakaya the space is small. 

I went with 2 other people and interestingly we were seated at a counter versus a table. Another odd thing that other reviewers have mentioned is that our waitress said everything on the menu is for sharing, including the ramen. I'll be ordering my own next time! In any case we ordered the following to share: the special fish robatayaki, bacon quail egg robatayaki, pork belly robatayaki, salmon temaki, tuna temaki, mackerel temaki, okonomiyaki and karaage. I would order everything again except for the special fish robatayaki as it was bland but everything else was delicious. One thing that was new to me were the plastic pippetts with soy sauce that came with the handrolls/temakis - I like how it controlled how much and when as I ate it!"}
{"text":"New favorite sushi spot and as thankful as the rest of reviewers are that it's on this side of town. Sat at the bar and the sushi chefs were very accommodating and helpful. Definitely order the sashimi salad. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went for the 1st time last night. Really enjoyed their food. My husband had some sushi(escolar, pacific tuna) pieces (really fresh) and the Carson Roll. I had the Shrimp Tempura Ramen and the garlic edamame. Will definitely go again, looking forward to trying something different!"}
{"text":"I honestly had much higher expectation. The ambiance is great, service was pretty good, but I definitely wasn't a fan of the ramen. Was really disappointed that there were no pork-less options besides the veggie ramen available"}
{"text":"OK, so I've been to many ramen places in Az and this by far is on top of the list. If I had to go in order of what contains the perfect ramen bowl it would be how

1. flavorful the broth is
2. the type of noodles
3. the toppings. 

It was my first time trying out Umami and I had high expectation and as it turned out this place met all the things I was looking for in a ramen bowl. The broth was flavorful and just right. It wasn't oily like other ramen places. The noodles were good and there were a selection of toppings which was great! However, not all comes with boiled egg and it's something you would have to add extra. Usually its expected for it to come with the ramen already but I guess not for all. 

The ambience of the place was nice and comfortable. A very relaxing spot to have the perfect ramen noodles. In the back they have table tennis as well to pass the time while waiting for your order but they're quick with serving your food. The servers were also friendly and informative when it comes to asking them questions on whats best in their menu. 

I would recommend checking this place out! :)
I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good place. I like the bbq skewer stuff. The sushi is good too as well as the deserts."}
{"text":"Awesome, great place for noodles. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent prices. You can get a very satisfying meal for $10. Try it! Quality is not sacrificed for price!"}
{"text":"New management do not see old photos. These rolls are gone!! This is an update to my first review. When this place opened almost a year ago it was great!! Selection of sushi and their Champaign cake was fantastic. 
Under new management and things are the same. 
Seems as if they are focusing on all you can eat and the roles mainly focus on spicy tuna and cream cheese. 
Our server was horrible! So fast, like she was busy with other tables and didn't want to wait while we glanced for a sec at the menu, before she walked away. Clearing our dishes before we are even done. Sorry to say, if it's not broken, DONT FIX IT. 

Missing the cake btw. Boo to new management and taking so many good rolls away. 






First timers and all I can say is great local sushi place.
Their atmosphere is so modern, love the open feel and cleanliness. 

Small inside so make sure you come early but we had zero problem getting in. 

Our server was Stephanie (very polite and attentive) much appreciated. 

Music is very upbeat and they have three Tv's. 

Everyone is just so friendly! All the food we had I have zero complaints. Made fresh. NOT fishy and made perfect compared to other sushi places near by. 
Thanks again for a great first impression."}
{"text":"Umami was incredible! I expected great things, and they delivered.

Entry is on the side of Round Corner Cantina up a couple flights of stairs into a NYC-like restaurant. Lighting is very dim and the decor is authentic to Japanese culture with a trendy twist. I did not feel like I was in Pittsburgh anymore!

I started my meal with the wagyu beef tenderloin skewers and the bacon quail eggs. Both were flawless. The beef was incredibly tender and the eggs, well, anything wrapped in bacon is going to be a winner. My next course was the pork gyoza pot stickers. The sesame sauce was very flavorful and the fried potstickers were the perfect texture. My main course was the tonkotsu ramen. Wow! I haven't had many experiences with \"ramen\" other than my college dorm room, but this is NOTHING like that. The pork ribs fell off the bone and the broth had such a great mix of spicy, sweet, and savory flavors. After seeing the portion of ramen, I maybe should have passed on an app or two. 

Umami is such a unique and exceptional addition to Pittsburgh's growing food scene. This is definitely my new spot to bring out-of-towners. This could be my new favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love the vegan broth with udon noodles! Keep it up guys! Service could be a little bit better, but definitely not terrible."}
{"text":"Best sushi in NW Vegas.  You can save the 45 min drive and the crowds and have amazing sushi in the NW.  first time here, didn't want to drive far from my house, so yelped ayce sushi.  Saw 41/2 stars and it didn't disappoint. Got almost every piece of nigri and all the no rice rolls.  Amazing, just hard to locate.  It's by BBW. Great price on saki and sushi and fresh quality fish in the NW."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Umami gets a 5. The prices get a 3. Way overpriced. I ordered the blue marlin appetizer and found out when it was delivered to my table that it was only 2 pieces of marlin with tuna also. I knew it was $30 going into it, but I thought I was getting only blue marlin. For the main course I ordered the elk. I was assured by our waitress that it does not taste like liver, because I hate liver. Guess what? It tasted just like liver. And it was chewy, overlooked. The goat cheese dumplings are why I come here. I guess I'll stick to my tried and true. But again, the ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Sadly this little gem has changed hands and menu. No longer the quality we loved. Massive production menu. More like the all you eat sushi factories.  It's now a chain. Wish we knew where the amazing sushi chefs went."}
{"text":"Okay, guys. Why is this place getting such a bad review? This is solid ramen. The broth and meat are good. There could be a little bit more meat added... But it's still delicious. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"Ramen is 5/5. I always get the spicy ramen (forgot what it's called) and it's always amazing! I like the atmosphere, but parking is a little of an issue."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to satisfy late night hunger pangs. Can be a lil difficult to spot at first, just look for Japanese writing. If you're in a wheelchair or have mobility issues, you have to climb 3 steep flights of stairs to get to the place. It's chic and trendy inside. My server, Kairo, was very nice.

Miso deviled eggs- ok. Normal deviled eggs with just a  bit more bite to them.

Spicy tuna sushi cone - ummm, SPICY. Jesus, it's SPICY. Didn't really taste like tuna to me bit then again, it was hard to taste anything but my burning taste buds. I can't recommend this."}
{"text":"With Myrtle being shut down, it was somewhat of an ordeal to locate Umami.  We finally called and walked about a 1/4 mile from where we parked. Oh well!

We were slightly confused but our server later confirmed this place Shady Park is really three places in one...two restaurants and one bar/lounge.  Interesting...hope it works out for them!

We were here for the noodles (as were most of the patrons, it seemed).  It'd been a while since we had Asian food (like two WHOLE days) so we were excited.  However, given where we were, we went in cautiously...

Ultimately, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of both Damato's and Umami's offerings with the exception of a couple things.  In the lineup:

Vegan Chop Salad:  REALLY good.  Can't even notice the \"veganess\" of it. The breaded vegan chicken was delightfully meaty and moist.

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was good.  However, the fried chicken topping hubby got was THE WORST.  It was stale and dry and hubby ended up picking it all out of his bowl to not eat. They're better off using the vegan chicken.

Spicy Tan Tan: This was my choice.  I got it with the pork belly which they confidently nicknamed \"crack\" as well as the soft boiled egg.  I also paid for the spicy garlic paste.  This dish was probably the best out of all we ordered.  The soft boiled egg was done well and the spicy garlic paste even had a little kick to it.  The pork belly was pretty good, too. (Not \"crack-like\" addictive, though.)

Squid Salad: Not sure if this is house-made; it generally isn't at most places so I don't hold it against them.  However, it seemed to be fishier than usual.  Wonder if it was old??

Our server was super nice and friendly, cute to boot. She checked in on us regularly and got us everything we wanted.

Bonus points for having an Addams Family pinball machine...50 cents per play ended up being actually 5 full games.

Only complaint:  It was warm.  It was a warm day and it wasn't super pleasant eating ramen in such a warm room.  We weren't sweating through our clothes but they need to have more air in there.

Totally hit the spot so we were happy."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness batman.... why hadn't I tried this place before? I was a fool, I thought a place with reviews like this couldn't possibly be good, but I was wrong. First of all, this place offers 2 hour parking validation for the brickyard lot, that's a great start. They have happy hour with a variety of drink and food specials. I had a drink that involved green tea and Korean alcohol of sorts... it was so so, but the bartender took is back without an issue, added some sweetness and made it something delicious... all for 5$. You can't beat that. I will say that their build your own ramen is a bit pricy, with a fairly plain bowl without meat starting at 8$, but they also have many bowls of ramen for only 6$ that have meat and various veg included. I went with the spicy which came with pork and scallions and I added roasted garlic and spicy corn. The ramen was really tasty, rich, maybe not quite as spicy as I'd like, but definitely good. It was a large portion and tasted great the next day as leftovers. My friend had one of the other 6$ ramens.... the one with the pork belly and the mix of pork broth and soy broth.... her ramen was insane.... I have never tasted such a rich and delicious broth before. We were both completely satisfied. There is definitely a return visit in my future!"}
{"text":"The ramen gods must have heard my prayers for they brought back my most favorite ramen...Umami! I was semi devastated when they closed with the (unlikely) promise of reopening. Well, they came back and are as good as ever. I've been back twice, each time getting the spicy shoyu adding spicy roasted garlic and togarashi corn....so so good. The roasted pork is so savory and on point...the broth is perfect....plus now you can get pizza with your ramen! Oh and did I mention they have 1$ (yes I said 1) sake bombers with food purchase. Oh yes. True story. Check out umami....it is fabulous!!!

Ps this may not be the most authentic ramen but the flavor is seriously out of this world so I don't care. That is all."}
{"text":"There are few Japanese restaurants that offer both sushi and ramen, so I was hoping Umami would fit the bill. Unfortunately, the ramen pales in comparison to the rich broth and melt-in-your-mouth pork that you will find in locales that specialize in ramen. Don't order the ramen here.

The teriyaki beef was rather tough and overly smothered with sauce. Also disappointing. 

Might be worth another visit to try the AYCE sushi, whose menu is enormous."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ramen here! And you definitely get your money's worth.

You start by picking a flavor. I usually get the Paitan. Which is a pork and chicken bone. I then add cracklings, spam, soft egg, corn and butter. Their broth is very tasty however I do think it's a bit salty. The customer service was ok. I didn't think the staff was very sociable. 

This isn't california so you're not going to get the best ramen in the world. But I think you do get your money's worth and it is quite delicious despite it being a bit salty."}
{"text":"So the new location definitely has a different feel compared to the old location. Since it is combined with shady park it has a more Americanized feel. It also feels more like you're hanging out at a college hangout/ bar. The atmosphere didn't feel like it goes with the menu. However it is a two in one restaurant.  

I got the paitan. I added corn, soft egg, spam, and pork belly. Just like the old location I thought the broth was a bit salty. However I liked everything else. Especially the ramen  noodles. It's a pretty big portion. I can typically only get through half. I also like the fact that their patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Ok so we went to check out the new sushi joint in our neighborhood.  It will be our goto place for sushi from now on.  Freshest fish in the neighborhood and great service."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant so advance restaurants are recommended. It books up however not just because it's small, but because it's good. The menu is small, but there are a few specials (appetisers, entrees, and desserts) written on a chalk board on the one wall each day. I ordered the special local salad of the day which was speckled romaine - it required cutting before eating which annoys me when it comes to salads, but it was very good. It was served with seared tomato wedges and parmesan. I also got the salmon which even though the restaurant asked if they could cook it medium rare they cooked it perfectly all the way through (well done) when I asked them to. Definitely a cool spot - kinda of intimate in size and lighting, a good addition to downtown Chagrin Falls. Parking in rear in Giant Eagle parking lot. And note if you reserve off their website via OpenTable you don't get points - go directly to OpenTable to reserve."}
{"text":"Ok, reviews I have seen here are mixed, which surprised me at first. My wife and I really do treasure the quaint time away from the kids and in a small and cozy Umami with Asian \"inspired\" dishes at the heart of one of the treasures in North east Ohio... Chagrin Falls. 
If location has anything to serve in a review, this location needs to be regarded for sure. Chagrin Falls is a pleasant and relaxing place to meander and enjoy the town feel. 
For Umami itself, the servers (1 for the entire dining room traditionally) are helpful yet un-intrusive . The food is pleasantly creative yet simple I call, contemp-ameri-asian. Gnocci, and seafood is fabulous with high end yet non pretentious approach. Although not my \"go to\" spot for sushi or sashimi, the entrees and apps are a satisfying and delicious event.
Being raised in Northeast Ohio I see why many think it's over priced, when our typical NEO guts are usually bombarded with cheap food by the metric ton... this is a place to relax, enjoy and share conversation. Not to gorge on piles of slop, and completely disregard each other during a meal.... sorry for the rant...
Prices for the quality and creativity of this food are tremendous if you compare or travel to other cities at all. 
it remains a delightful spot for my wife and I as a weeknight treasure."}
{"text":"This place is crazy over rated. Let's start with the not horrible parts:

1. The Sushi was not bad I would give it a 4 out of 5
2. After making us wait a ridiculous amount of time they apologized (there was a mix up) and gave us a small discount but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else.

The bad:

1. We ordered sodas and they brought us cans of sodas. I'm actually fine with the cans, whatever if you can't afford a soda machine. The problem is that you didn't tell me ahead of time that I was paying for a drink that I wouldn't get free refills on. I shouldn't get this type of surprise.
2. The chicken in the dishes was not very good quality, this nice of a place should not have Panda Express level chicken.
3. They should have figured out way earlier that there was a problem with our order. The two people who were eating sushi had already started eating a second round before they even started cooking the other food. Fail."}
{"text":"Under new mgmt. New menu and now all you can eat.  New staff and chefs were friendly and helpful, but the high end sushi options and the presentation are gone. Plastic menus and paper napkins.
    
The salmon, tuna and shrimp sushi I tried were OK, but my etemami did not seem fresh. It is not bad as all you can eat places go. If that is what you want. I am looking for higher end up here in the NW area. I liked not having to go all the way down to the strip. Miss the old sushi chefs and my fav sushi dishes. SO BUMMED!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever had. Took 15 min for a person to come service. They didn't even bring us menus. Had to go get them myself. Didn't come and collect the payment. Had to go to the bar to pay. The food was ok."}
{"text":"I have to say this is an amazing five star restaurant real Japanese sushi the food is incredible is my second time and it was just as good the second time as was the first time"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time visiting Umami, and with the exception of the ramen, it did not disappoint. Since we were only able to get a reservation at 4:30, we were the first people there. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly by the time we had left though, so it's a good thing we got there early! 

We started out with some happy hour priced drinks. I got a peach fizzy cocktail drink that came in a bottle and it was delicious. Perfect for a hot day! For our food, we ordered: an eggplant skewer which was flavorful and grilled perfectly, okonomiyaki, stir fried udon, and the pork ramen. The okonomiyaki and udon dishes were amazing and they gave huge portions for the price! The udon especially was unlike anything I've had at another restaurant and I would highly recommend ordering it. I'm deducting a star for the ramen - the broth was not very flavorful and the noodles, while plentiful, didn't have the texture I like for ramen noodles. Pretty disappointing. 

Overall, the service was great and the rest of our food was yummy. I will definitely be back for that udon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place on the second floor of the building. The place is pretty, with a bit of a \"Pittsburgh meets Miyazaki\" vibe. The rolls are simple but tasty. The yaki udon is absolutely stunning. I've never had any quite like this."}
{"text":"I was really really excited to try this place since before they're opened. I was sort of disappointed. This place is more like a 3.5 stars for me, I decided to give them a 3 because we made a reservation but still wasn't able to sit at a table. They asked us to wait another twenty mins for the table, so we decided to sit at the bar. The food I've tried is delicious but nothing was the best I've ever had. The okonomiyaki and bacon quail egg were yummy, the matcha sponge cake dessert is also very good! Other things I've tried, takoyaki, miso Raman, Chicken skin and chicken thigh are just average. I will have to give this place another try, and update my review. For now, I'm not super excited about it!"}
{"text":"Ugh wHyyyy o y did u change management??? This used to b sUch a great restaurant ..now..ingredients no longer fresh, presentation off, menu diff w less stuff, rolls not rolled right, miso soup literally just broth no seaweed or tofu..?? Won't ever be coming back here. Such a shame y'all got bought out or whatever happened cuz this place used to b bomb a f."}
{"text":"I am ashamed it took me this long to finally try Umami. This one truly lives up to the hype.

Finding it was the tough part. The doors weren't clearly labeled so I felt like I was about to barge into someone's living room. Once we finally navigated our way up to the restaurant, we were seated at the bar because the space is sooo limited plus we were there on a Saturday night with no reservation - oops. 

Vegetarian items are all clearly labeled which was a huge help considering I had no idea what half the ingredients listed were. It could've been a fish or a mushroom - no clue. I ordered the vegetarian rice ball (onigiri) because I've never tried one and it looked pretty darn good in Pokémon. Either I was was being a huge baffoon or it was poorly made because it fell apart as soon as I tried to eat it. It was delicious but it could've used more filling. For my main entree, I ordered the donburi with tofu and it was incredible. Huge portion and packed with so many toppings and flavors. They were a little too heavy handed with the sauce which was overbearing at times, but otherwise, it was amazing. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best roman I have ever ate!  The protein bowl was killer, staff is super friendly and fun, awesome environment plus super affordable!  My new favorite spot on mill without a doubt!!!"}
{"text":"Update November 25, 2017.
Umami has new ownership and had turned into the typical AYCE sushi place. I've been and was unimpressed with the new service or quality of food. Stay away.


If you're honest with yourself you know there hasn't been any really good sushi in Centennial. When I need sushi I've been willing to drive 20 minutes away for a decent restaurant. 

I think Umami may have changed that. My husband and I went recently on a weekday night and sat at the sushi bar. Freshness and flavor were comparable to the better places in Chinatown or on the strip. They had special selections of fish that were not on the menu but offered to us. And this is really important - the sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about different types of fish and flavor. We really like this place and will return!

Things I'd like to see- wi-Fi. If you had Wi-Fi I'd probably eat there every day. I can't come for lunch and be completely detached from work. I'd also like to see options like chirashi or donburi. Not sure if I'm able to order this off the menu--if available, please let me know!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm underwhelmed.
It's s nice place don't get me wrong but it's more hype than anything. The drinks are pricey and the food is ok. It's not awful but it's just nothing to write home about.
It's packed with millennials in a cramped space. The floor plan is well laid out considering the small space. 
I'll probably give it another shot but if I do I won't rush out to do so."}
{"text":"The chirashi bowl was excellent, the karaage was delicious, and the drinks were very tasty."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to. The food there is authentic and delicious. I ordered a bowl of ramen. Its presentation was on point and taste was even better. There are also countless amounts of exotic drinks to explore. Above all, though, is the atmosphere of this place. It's just so fun! With a live DJ, energetic waitstaff, and a good crowd, Umami is a go to for any evening out! Oh, it's also cool to note that I went to this restaurant for a friend's 21st birthday. We were able to reserve a really nice secluded room in the back (do recommend)!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of umami since before it was attached to shady park, and since they have joined together my boyfriend and I have probably been coming about once a week, if not more. We have also told countless other people about how great it is and have brought many people there. The service has always been exceptional, and we have had 5 or 6 different servers. However, this most recent time, it was terrible. I am not usually the kind of person to write reviews, but I felt I had to. Our server, Britt, made no effort to make us happy or meet our expectations that every other server has easily done. She knew she had upset us as well because she barely checked on us throughout the entire meal. We even had to get another server to grab us to-go boxes because of the lack of attention. I am a server as well and because of this I usually tip at least 30% if not more, but this time I did not. Britt was by far the worst server I have had at any restaurant and we almost don't want to come back any more because of this. In fact, we were so upset we even left a full pitcher of beer on the table because we didn't want to be there any longer. We were planning on bringing our entire new years party of about 20 people to this restaurant, but are rethinking because of this visit. Management has done an exceptional job of staffing this restaurant with great servers, including Nico and Amanda, with the exception of Britt and I hope that something is done to resolve this."}
{"text":"Good location is pretty much the only thing this place has going for it.
Completely overpriced! The menu is so limited and the food is... meh...
If you're going to serve udon noodles soup for $20, it better be the best damn udon soup, with fillet mignon steak floating in it. In fact, it was mediocre at best.

The sushi wasn't tasty at all. It honestly felt like they weren't even trying to cook great food for those prices.

I went to try it cause they had a groupon, and for this this is a good way to get introduced to new restaurants. Well, I'm glad I had the groupon discount; cause I wouldn't be happy paying that bill in full for the small and not so tasty portions we got."}
{"text":"What an incredible night! I'm a big fan of trusting the server or chef and just having them send out whatever are their fave dishes. I definitely recommend this if you're not picky and get the vibe that your server knows what's up.

We shared all the dishes between four of us. I loved the Zaru Soba (chilled noodles) and the Nagi Shigiyaki (pan friend eggplant topped on ground chicken). The Pork Gyoza and Takoyaki was good, but the first two dishes blew those away. Although the Wigle Whiskey made soy sauce that accompanied the Pork was stellar!

For sushi we tried the Onigiri and Maguro Temaki which were both not only fabulous in presentation, but matched in incredible flavor. But get the spicy tuna for the Onigiri... You can thank me later. We also split the Chirashi Bowl, which secretly I probably could have eaten myself! I love those bowls so much and it wasn't massive and could be enjoyed as an individual app or starter.

I was also delighted to see they had mochi on the menu. If you haven't had this yet, get it. It's the best way to end such a fabulous meal!"}
{"text":"Had wasabi tako -great would've loved to see fresh wasabi though,
 uni sushi- fresh and yum and price was good! 
Chicken teriyaki (dinner) was good also, it was a dinner plate with hibachi style veggies, zucchini, carrot, onion, asparagus. Chicken was yum,
Hangar steak was good, asked for medium rare and it came out rare but quick fix, and was fast and delicious. Unexpected vinegar kind of mignonette sauce but somehow you wanted more, i did try it with some extra soy and that brought out the buttery taste in the steak which means it probably needed more salt, 

Overall, its not the umami i was expecting being avid Japanese cuisine lover, but it was definitely more authentic in comparison to the average sushi place. FYI, its a Japanese restaurant. It is not an ayce sushi place."}
{"text":"Went back today and was a little confused. The hard boiled egg addition is now a pickled egg, which is doesn't say anywhere on the menu. My friend got the vegan noodle bowl and it came with rice noodles, when last time it came with ramen noodles- also we were never brought sriracha or any of the spice packets. Not saying it was bad, just disappointed in the lack of consistency."}
{"text":"I tried Umami with my daughter's since we were in the area and they have great reviews...and rightfully so.  We had a few sushi rolls, the short ribs, and the tempura udon.  All were excellent and the service was great.  We went back again, tried a few different rolls, but I ordered the short ribs again!  Was impressed again even though we ate there just a few days ago.  Its a nice upscale restaurant without any AYCE, buts its worth every bit..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fresh fish and good service. Finally, a legit sushi restaurant in the NW!!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely open last time I checked! 
I still don't trust it though, there is something seriously too addicting and delicious about their ramen!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the northwest to get AYCE sushi. It is always fresh and the service is always on point! I usually just get nigiris so I'm not too sure on how the rolls are. The last time we were there my husband's family was visiting and they were so nice and made the kids oranges that looked like bears. My daughter who has allergies usually can't eat much at restaurants we go to so she was beyond delighted when they brought it to our table. It was so nice of them to go out of there way to make those for them!"}
{"text":"Really solid place. Expect small portions and not the massive rolls you typically see. It's very good and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Great cocktails, too."}
{"text":"When you need a ramen fix in the valley- there are still not too many options, but this will remedy your salty noodle hankering and leave you full and happy.  Consistently yum with good service.  We always come back!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in the Phoenix area by far. Got the chicken and pork broth with tofu , pork, corn inside. It is for sure comfort food. Just perfect. I love how the broth just come with so many great sources of protein and and fiber in it. I also got green tea which was also delicious.  It is served with a lemon and honey packet. The service was actually great for us. There were so many people helping out at all tables. And we were there on a Friday night at 7. I can not wait to go back"}
{"text":"Everything they have is fresh and the prices are not bad at all. I'd say this place ranks top 5 in Vegas too with a super friendly staff.."}
{"text":"Finally- a good ramen place in Pittsburgh!!!! Absolutely loved our experience here. The food came fast and was so delicious. We got the meatballs, spicy tuna rice ball, fried chicken and tonkatsu ramen. Everything was phenomal. Will definitely be back a LOT!"}
{"text":"This place really pisses me off!! Why? Well.. I've driven here twice now and the first time they were closed due to closing an hour early! Next, they put a sign out front saying they were closed (on super bowl). If I New I would've gone else where obviously!!! The dates and times for business are questionable. Call before driving there."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how this place is not always jam-packed. It is THE best sushi place in Vegas, hands down! I'd give it ten stars if I could. Every item on the menu we've tried is beyond delicious. Chef Kim is no longer here but Chef Joon is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bento box and it was odd. No rice. No miso soup. Just three sides and not in a bento box. They were out of a lot of items. I ordered the pickles, seaweed salad, edamame, and a roll. Wasn't anything special. Did not seem homemade. The location is nice though."}
{"text":"Living in NW Las Vegas means when you're hungry taste buds are saying Udon! Ramen  Bento  or sushi  means a 13 mile trip into the Decatur--Jones--Spring Mountain Asian Food Triangle

.... By chance I wanted to visit the T-Mobile store located at Durango and the 215 exit.....when I pulled into a parking slot, I noticed that the store almost in front of me had a big sign reading UMAMI (and that means tasty good in Japanese)...they had a sidewalk billboard with the words \" All You Can Eat Sushi  \" 

 ...We went in looked at the menu and it included Bento, Ramen, Udon, Teriyaki, & grilled  fish. Wow  

....we ordered one spicy  tuna and one California Roll...and both tasted freshly made using good sushi  rice. My wife ordered Tempura Udon and i ordered Tonkotsu Ramen-----the udon tasted delicious and my ramen was original and unique to this establishment ..and it was  tasty... will come back to this place when we don't want to drive into town for  Japanese food"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the top ramen places I been to. I have tried ramen in Dallas, Tx and in Vegas. The price is not too bad. I had the paitan broth with roasted pork, pork belly, crackling, hard boiled egg, and kimchi. Everything was really good. Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ramen, every ingredient made from scratch to perfection. I had the Paitan with pork belly and cracklings, spicy corn and kimchi. Amazing. The owners are here. She greets you, he cooks. Patio, dining room and bar. You gotta check it out."}
{"text":"Very good. A little high priced considering a few Sushi places that are all you can eat. Not all great but a few are exceptional and a lot cheaper than this. Lobster Ramon is excellent, very spicy but so good. Sushi Rolls great as far as what we ordered. Oysters very small, too small for the price. Sushi, good but not so cold. Raw fish should be cold not room temperature. Staff was great the bus boys are awesome. (Hope the share in the tips because the really take good care of you).! Nice to have this on our side of town and will no doubt be back."}
{"text":"Went with my name twin for lunch and ordered off of the pre-made specials: spicy shoyu. It came with shredded pork. As this was my first time eating ramen at a restaurant, I would have to say it tasted good not exceptional but that was because I thought it came with pork belly but that is my fault. Other than that, I would like to give it another try but build my own bowl next time or read before I order :)"}
{"text":"Umami was a Jewel, now it is like every other mediocre sushi place so disappointed, the new management has ruined what was a great experience, behind the host podium they have put their Togo service station that now clutters the sushi bar. They have also crudely taped paper announcements to the walls. The food used to be really good, today it was terrible the lunch Roll combo served a salad of iceberg lettuce and a couple pieces of spinach and julienne carrot with a squeeze of dressing in the center of it coating one piece of lettuce and saturated with water. The tempura was greasy and miso soup was I don't know what, more like dish water! The spicy tuna roll was mushy and the sushi rice was not seasoned. When we moved to the North West we were so excited for this restaurant and frequented often today will be our last time! The old menu was well written and thoughtful for the customer the new menu is just like every other place around nothing special."}
{"text":"I've never had \"real\" ramen before Umami, and now I keep coming back!

The service, despite a few reviews here, is fine. The waitresses don't bother the snot out of you while you eat, but they also don't leave you alone to die when you're not quite good enough at eating ramen with chopsticks yet. They're very helpful when it comes to questions about the menu, they deliver your food quickly, and they'll easily accept alterations to your meal minutes AFTER you hand them the check-off order sheet.

The atmosphere is really cool. Simple but modern, with a couple chalkboard walls to advertise their specials/deals and let customers draw their own designs. The bathrooms are pretty and very clean.

But most importantly, the ramen is amazing. The broth is flavorful (yes, a little salty, but I'd rather it be that way than not salty enough), rich and soothing to a sore throat (this is a perfect restaurant for those suffering from colds). The meat is tender (get the pork belly and the chicken) and the vegetables, though I often remove them, are well cooked. All of the flavors meld together nicely and if you happen to have extra by the end of your meal, this ramen actually makes for great leftovers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ADORE Umami. We went several times when it was more of an Asian fusion restaurant in a hidden location in Tempe, and were devastated when we heard it shut down. We're both incredibly happy that Umami re-opened in Shady Park, a college hangout spot that it shares with an Italian restaurant and a cool bar. 

The flavors and options are all the same as they were before, and we couldn't be more satisfied. Add-ons are completely worth the $0.50 - $2 they cost, because they make an already delicious meal even better. Service is great, and the food is filling.

TIP: Ramen does wonders for a cold."}
{"text":"Nothing says you don't care about your customers more than not communicating that you're closed for a week when there is construction going on around your restaurant and one has to park three blocks away and walk in the heat."}
{"text":"Finally tried this Sushi joint that is still fairly new to the Centennial area. Prices and portions weren't bad. Modern decor. Waiter was great! I couldn't give all 5 stars because I could get all you can eat sushi down the street for approximately the same price give or take a few dollars. However they do have ramen that I did not try. I would go back to try that eventually. If you don't eat enough sushi to pay he all you can eat price. I would definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen with miso soup, added tofu, egg, and spicy corn. 

The soup was a bit too salty and it sucks they removed the different options off the menu. There was only ramen or the bento box. 

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Sooo yummy! This is definitely my new favorite ramen stop! I had never got fried chicken in ramen but it stood out to me and wow was it delicious! Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and overall savory. I feel like other ramen restaurants serve quite low quality meat in their ramen but this looked and tasted great! The noodles were perfect. I absolutely hate soggy noodles and these were cooked exactly to my liking. I am so impressed with this restaurant. Ramen was reasonable but it can get pricey if you go crazy with your toppings. I do believe none of the ramen includes actual meat so if you want some you need to add it as a topping to your ramen. They also give you a big chilled bottle of water so you can give yourself refills and I think that it great. The service was friendly and they answered all my questions in regards to the menu. This place is definitely worth the time."}
{"text":"There are not that many Japanese cuisine in the NorthWest side of Las Vegas and this was so close to home. Great food, service and the staff/management was very friendly. I wished it was AYCE. But otherwise, this is a highly recommended place to go to! Try the champagne cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Ramen in the valley! My favorite is their Posh collaboration menu, better than the stuff at Posh! Sadly the place is closing December 10th 2015."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to have to give Umami a low rating. The reason for this is because it is under new management and we were pretty disappointed to see an entire new menu when we walked in. My boyfriend and I had been there before the management change and we absolutely loved it so when we went back we already knew what we wanted only to find those items were no longer available. It is now an all you can eat and the quality has really gone down. If we hadn't already ordered drinks we would have left based on how different the menu is. It's very off putting to have the same name but have everything different. If you have never been there before, give it a try since you don't have the original to compare it to. I will say they they are attentive and making sure everyone is taken care of so that was good! However, if you have been there before the management change you will be highly disappointed. As I am sure you will see from other reviews. I don't see us coming back."}
{"text":"I love Umami. 
It's my favorite place for Ramen in Phoenix fo sho.  

Great quality food, nice selection of ingredients to add, broths are tasty, it's not too expensive,  and it comes out in a timely manner.  Love it."}
{"text":"Thrilled we now have Umami as a restaurant choice. 

We have been there several times.  We have had the Raman bowls which are filling and excellent.  The specialty roles are well worth the price, as the fish is always fresh.  The garlic edamame was very good..it had some kick.  I've had both the cucumber salad and house salad both great for inexpensive price. 

They offer a wide selection of food choices, including sushi, regular dinner choices, teriyaki choices, ramen dishes.  The prices range from low to high depending on the dish. 

This is not a fast food restaurant,  this is better dining. They have a few \"BIG\" booths for larger parties, which is nice if a lot of people share sushi dishes.  

I recommend this restaurant, the service and food is consistently great. My husband has degrees in culinary arts (chef), he's pretty picky.  He applauds this restaurant.  Do try some of the more expensive sushi specialty dishes,  they are worth the money."}
{"text":"This space is awesome. It's a hidden gem of you're looking for great music, awesome vibe, and the best spicy scallops roll in pgh. Great drink selection. Prices are fair. Will be my new spot when I crave sushi."}
