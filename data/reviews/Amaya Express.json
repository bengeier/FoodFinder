{"text":"Had a WagJag deal to try this place out. I love Indian and was looking forward to it. I ordered a butter chicken plate and a spinach veggie plate off the menu. As soon as they saw the WagJag - the person began complaining that I should have shown him the voucher before ordering. He said the WagJag offer has its own menu (which it does not and he could not show it to me), and he basically charged me some random prices for the food I just ordered that was roughly 80-90% more than menu prices.  The food: portions are small, butter chicken had only 2 small chunks of chicken, and I was overall disappointed with the taste. The only thing I liked was the naan (for which I paid $2 for one piece).   Service: not friendly, awkward.   Not going back there again, which is unfortunate since I live across the street."}
{"text":"One word - yummy!!!  They have a few tables in the front and we actually ate in. It was cozy and had an understated elegance with friendly, detail oriented service and superb presentation.    As for the food, the Naan is among the best I've had and the tamarind sauce for the Onion Bhaji was delightfully playful.  Will definitely add it to my list of faves."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, Friendly!  Amazing food and wonderful aromas wafting from the kitchen and the service was very friendly.  The place is low on visual ambiance but everything else makes up for that."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. I have eaten before at the Eaton Centre location - which incidentally has a pretty nice tandoori oven where they cook the naan bread while you wait. Anyway, back to this location - I thought it was good. Clearly my experience was better than the other reviewers here.   I only ordered the Samosa plate, but will be back to try other dishes. The Samosa was flavourful and cooked well. I added a few toppings and sauces including some chickpea sauce. The dish tasted pretty nice to me. It was cheap as well - I had a bottle of water, a coke and the samosas and the price came to $7.25 incl taxes. The portion was big as well.  While the food was being prepared, we chatted to the guy serving us the food and he was nice - telling us about how naans and chicken were prepared in India etc.   Overall - it is clearly not a fine dining establishment, but it is an alternative to subway next door or pita land across the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy ordering take out from this place. The food is always consistent and in my opinion, the best Indian food in town.  There is never a long wait between order time and delivery, and once I placed an order and forgot to order garlic naun (I only ordered regular) and when I picked it up I noticed my mistake, and they made me some fresh garlic naun on the spot for no extra charge. It made me feel special as a customer."}
{"text":"Servers get orders wrong,  had to ask numerous times what everyone's order was. (Every one who was standing in line.)  Oh,  and the \"butter chicken combo\" is rice with four small pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"I tried all Amaya restaurant, but the only one i liked and found good in terms of \"butter chicken\" was the express one at Urban eatery in the eaton centre. We went today, and to my surprise the chicken was mixed with fresh and old ones, I could neither bite it nor cut it with knife, I was very disappointed. I don t know what they were thinking to cheat and mix the chicken, as if people wouldn't notice.  Anyhow, I will never ever go to any Amaya's for sure, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Stay away from that restaurant folks."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in North York. Amazing prices when you come in for the lunch special, great friendly service, and always super delicious."}
{"text":"If you can handle spicy then you should try this place. I had the beef vindaloo which I was told was spicy. However I wasn't told that there was whole chucks of hard dried herbs that are difficult to eat . There seemed to be more less spices and more spicy flavor to the meal. The naan I had was probably store bought, but it tasted alright"}
{"text":"The food was a bit pricey for what we got. Additionally, the delivery guy stole our credit card info which turned into a big headache.  The owner did eventually send us a small gift card as an apology, but we won't be giving them more of our business."}
{"text":"I seem to be one of the odd men out with this establishment.      I actually like this place. It has decent food and at fair prices, at least for what I order anyways - which would be the Royal Platter and the samosas. It's about $25 including tax and it's enough to last me about two meals, but then again, I'm a pretty small gal.       I go for pick-ups so I can't comment on the delivery time, but my orders have always been ready for me in under 20 minutes. The customer service is meh, but I consider this to be a fast food restaurant since its take-out only, so that's just fine with me.       If you come here expecting average, then you won't be disappointed.  Check out their website for menus."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try indian food for a while, but since I can't really handle spicy food, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it. Finally, I tried Amaya Express a couple weeks ago and I have to say, it was delicious! I was a bit hesitant because it's a chain and I wanted to try something authentic, but this being my first experience with Indian food, I cant really tell.  My husband and I picked up a 'Dinner for 4' with extra naan to share with some friends. All of us (including my almost 2yr old son) loved it! It wasn't a bad price either, considering we had so much food it lasted us (and the other couple) a few days.   Sooo tastey! - even when you're too lazy to reheat the leftovers :P"}
{"text":"their curries were watery. my vegetable side of saag pander had 2 pieces of cheese only. for $10 it was not a lot of quality food. to meal was unsatisfying"}
{"text":"Please don't misunderstand me, I like Amaya, but this specific location, mmmm, the food isn't great, you will find veggies to be over cooked or not cooked, the location is great if you are driving by Queen St.E after a long day at work and if you feel very lazy to cook, unfortunately after few times I picked up food here I don't feel good enough to stop by again. A bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm impressed! I've found it hard to get good Indian food in Toronto (which makes no sense!)  - previously I would have rated Banjara on Bloor as Toronto's best Indian restaurant. But since moving to my new digs near Ossington I've been doing takeout at Amaya. The flavours are excellent and things taste like excellent home made food. Try the chutneys and pickles that come with the poppadoms and you'll see what I mean. Their sweet and sour eggplant sounds strange (sweet and sour?!) but is outstanding! The My only complaint is that if you eat in you'll end up smelling smokey like the kitchen - they need better extractor fans."}
{"text":"If you eat south Asian food often don't eat here.. But if you're looking for an exciting change and aren't very familiar with Indian food definitely try it (unless you can't handle spice at all). I eat a lot of spicy food but this was intolerably spicy, I couldn't taste anything and the curry dishes were too watery.. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service and servers put their hand always into the bowls and wipe sweat from forehead with them. No hygiene followed of gloves washing hands, scratching face hair etc..  And to top it off pretty rude and intolerant bunch of people. Food is ok but really for me its always customer service and hygiene. bad place"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Maya Express Leslieville on a somewhat regular basis and find their food to be that of much better quality (especially their meats) than when ordering from any other establishment specializing in Indian cuisine. We were pleased to see that they have finally put chana masala on their menu! We had a bad experience just the other night with our delivery being extremely late however Amaya had been very professional with correcting the situation leaving us with a positive feeling for the business. Thank you Amaya, we will continue to order your tasty food!"}
{"text":"So it took a long time to get the nerve up to try this again!!  But I did, and I have to say - the Chicken Tikka Masala - MUCH better! Avoid the butter chicken, as it's tasteless.  The garlic naan is also quite good, though a little pricy at $3. You do get a good sized one though to be fair.  I've had it twice now and it's been decent both times. And when I say decent, I do mean for mall food court food. If you want really good indian, go somewhere else. But on a day you want something a little different than McD's, etc, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"Probably one of the few places in the new Urban Eatery that's worth trying out. Not the best in Indian cuisine, but definitely good for takeout standards. A bit on the pricey side, but really satisfying if you're ready to splurge."}
{"text":"I had been to Amaya the Indian Room on Bayview Ave and was really impressed by the food there. Foolishly thought that, despite the mall setting, an established restaurant like that would want to preserve its reputation by serving at least half-decent fare. I ordered the Masala Lime Lamb curry bowl and at first bite, immediately regretted spending my hard-earned cash on Amaya instead of, say, the KFC located in the same food court. Bland as hell and totally devoid of even a hint of spiciness. I wasn't expecting flagship restaurant standards but c'mon! I've had much better food from shady-looking Indian buffet places on Gerrard St.   The lack of customers in an otherwise very busy food court should've tipped me off. If you're a fan of Indian food, avoid this place like a plague."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat. Staff is extremely rude. I don't know what the owner is doing with this place. They should shut down and teach their staff some manners first."}
{"text":"Terrible and Inconsistent.  Been there 3 times.  I tried to like this place and gave it a chance.  The 1st time was ok.  The 2nd time the service was terrible with the hard sell to buy the more expensive options on the menu.  The 3rd time they tried to rip me off!!  Unbelievable, in this day and age, especially at Yorkdale mall.   $8.50 for a roti is a fair price but when the server only gave me a single teaspoon of topping on a huge bread roti that's when I said stop.  Serious rip off.  Complained and walked out... so did the couple behind me after witnessing what had happened. The servers looked stunned but what did they expect.  These people need to learn customer service Canadian style.  I would avoid them for a few months until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch. The presentation of the food was amazing and the food itself was great. Service could be stepped up a notch, though it is an express/fast food restaurant the people behind the counter could use a little more training. The prices were not bad, $10 for a combo type meal including a main, rice and salad. A meal for two came to $27 with taxes in and two drinks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick Indian fix. Flavours were on point and the food tasted fresh enough."}
{"text":"Although the food may be fine, a delivery time of 2 hours is not acceptable. Maybe it is ok to eat at the restaurant but I do not recommend ordering delivery."}
{"text":"HATE IT. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.   I got the curry bowl (butter chicken and rice) for $9 in a small container. What was even more ridiculous was a piece of naan costed $2.75. I cancelled the naan and ended up paying 10 bucks for just a small container of food. I should have gone to subway and easily enjoyed a combo for $9. Nevermind all of that, the employee on cash was giving me attitude for asking why a piece of naan was so expensive. He was on his phone while I paid and did not acknowledge me after that. Horrible customer service.  My mom cooks better indian food than this. Even the Indian food on Gerrard st is cheaper and tastier than this place. If anyone rates this place more than two stars, they do not know real Indian food!   NEVER GOING BACK. Complete waste of money!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A gluten free delight for all of those who like Indian fare the staff is kind, warm & helpful with suggestions regarding their menu. The atmosphere is relaxing as it's never too busy but busy enough to know that the food is good & people are enjoying their meals.   I highly suggest for anyone looking to eat done delicious Indian food to head down to any location and try something. You will never know how good tell your taste buds tell you otherwise."}
{"text":"Amaya Express at Sherway Garden has the best food in the entire food court. It is prepared fresh and taste delicious. You should check it out."}
{"text":"The food was bland and one-dimensional. It was either over or under salted. The curries are skimpy on the paneer and the corn side dish tasted like it was 2 days old.   We've tried this place twice now and both times the same."}
{"text":"Its not bad for food court food. I'm having the butter chicken and I really wish it was less salty. Way more rice than anything which is why at 10$ I find this a little over priced. I'm not regretting my choice but I don't think i'll be back"}
{"text":"Ok. It's close so convenient to me but not the best Indian food I've ever had.  Sometimes it's overly spicy and they put too much salt on the pakoras but ok if you tell them not too spicy.  I like spice but overly spicy can be unedible."}
{"text":"I've never had Biryani before so maybe my opinion doesn't count too much, but I ordered the chicken biryani and vegetarian biryani and both were amazing. Huge quantity (each of our meals lasted 3 meals), and lovely flavours. This is my first fast food mall Indian food, but isn't the first time I've had Indian food (we absolutely love curry!).  Hopefully our next experience is just as good as the first!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but staff are very new and confused. They offered me to \"try\" their nan bread but they charged me for it and refused to return it!"}
{"text":"I tried this place a long time back when urban eatery first opened up, and I remember not liking it... but recently, during one of my \"i'm too lazy to cook dinner\" runs, I mustered all my will power and walked past schezuan express (their placement close to the entry stairs, and the very appetizing aroma wafting right into my face makes it impossible for me to try much else in this food court!) and decided to give Amaya a second chance, plus i was jonesing for some curry. I got their combo deal, with two meat dishes - the beef vindaloo and coconut lamb curry, and the potato/cauliflower veggie dish and a plain naan to go with it all. All of that plus a soda came up to $18 - kind of ridiculous by food court standards, but then again urban eatery does not really fall into typical food court classification.  One bite into the food, and it came back to me very clearly why I didn't like this place the first time I tried it. I don't know how else to describe every dish than watery. Like literally watery, I almost feel like they were running low on their food, and decided to just add water to it. And usually I think Indian food is pretty hard to mess up - every Indian restaurant I have tried have all been average at the very least. Congratulations Amaya, you have defied the norms of food court prices and Indian food quality!  No, just NO. I will still with Schezuan Express next time, or try the other indian place at the food court across the street (below AMC yonge/dundas)."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly, it's great that they give samples upon entry, however this place leaves something to be desired every time I give it a chance....  Once my mom ordered a curry bowl to go, we ate it in the food court anyways just a few minutes after it was ordered, and for some reason it was cold!!! Doesn't make sense!!  Then I came recently, ordered a butter chicken bowl. The portion was huge and it would have been nice to know beforehand. I could only eat half, so I would probably suggest sharing. It was served with some sort of curried chickpeas and rice. The chickpeas weren't cooked well, I didn't enjoy them at all. Basically didn't touch them. The butter chicken was on the sweeter side. It had good taste but it really wasn't THAT great. I would eat there again, it just wasn't the Indian food I know and love.   Got a side of garlic naan. This was possibly the only really enjoyable part of the meal. It was actually amazing, but really who could go wrong with naan.   But all in all if you want your Indian fix at yorkdale's caf, go for it. My experience might not have been that great but maybe yours will be."}
{"text":"Just had a less than spectacular lunch at Amaya Express at the Eaton Centre's new food court (\"Urban Eatery\").   My husband ordered the lamb roti, only to be told they don't have that available. So he said he'd take the Chicken Tikka Roti instead.... Same response \"not this week, maybe next week\". So he said he's have the lamb box meal (with Black Eyed peas, \"salsa\", and rice). Again - they don't have it - \"maybe next week!\". So as a 4th option, he chose the Chicken Tikka box meal, and I had the Butter Chicken bowl.   The butter chicken was actually fairly satisfying - the chicken was tender and flavourful, and they added some chickpeas to the side which were also nice (and a bit spicy). As I ate though, I realized my rice was quite wet. No big deal though, the meal was okay.   My husband though was less than impressed. What he didn't realize when ordering the box, was that the Chicken Tikka would be cold. We presume it is chilled on purpose, for the wraps/roti? But it was a disappointment, considering he was expecting a warm meal, and it turned out not to be.   The staff all still seem to really be just learning the ropes. I know it is new (having just opened last week). But they must have had training before the food court opened? They all seemed to be lacking in knowledge of the food. They weren't clear when explaining what was out of stock. And when we asked near the cash \"is that a mango shake?\", we were told (in an unsure voice) by staff \"I think it's a milkshake that kind of tastes like mango?\". We also asked for vegetable samosas, but did not receive them (we don't think we paid for them either though). But it just seemed like overall the staff really weren't sure of themselves, and that had an impact on our overall impressions of the meal.   Next time I will go to my old standby Fast Fresh Foods!"}
{"text":"The first thing you should know about food from Amaya is that it all looks the same -- see photo. Every dish we ordered, without exception, was the same colour and consistency - orange goo. Based on the menu descriptions, we were hoping for three distinct vegetarian dishes, however it appears that there was a special on orange goo sauce, as it was added to every dish. In the entree advertised as \"braised baby root vegetables,\" there was nary a root vegetable in sight, other than some sad-looking carrot slices; peppers and broccoli are not \"root vegetables\" in my dictionary.   The eggplant dish that we ordered actually did have eggplant -- a few pieces floating in the aforementioned orange goo. Remarkably, it did taste -- a bit -- of the promised tamarind. Still very gooey.   We ordered brown basmati rice and instead received some other sort of rice which was short-grained and clumpy -- definitely not basmati. The naan was quite thick and doughy. No orange goo to report here, at least. The raita and pickles were sub-par.   Did I also mention the small pieces of shredded aluminum foil that I almost accidentally ate? Somehow they made it into one of the main dishes, camouflaged by -- you guessed it -- orange goo.   Of course, it wouldn't be fair to be entirely negative about Amaya Express. To their credit, the delivery actually arrived early, and on New Year's Eve, no less! Still,the food strongly resembles vomit; we won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food and the menu. Quality and quantity is not the worth pricing. It's a rip off. Will never order from here again. Butter chicken tastes like Campbell's tomato soup with little pieces of chicken. Lamb biryani lacked the lamb. Had only a cpl pieces of lamb in it. Everything comes with little meat but lots of sauce. None of the food came with rice or naan bread. You have to order it separately. Again that's a rip off as that should be included. Don't order from."}
{"text":"We got takeout, dinner for two. We're new to the city and received the menu, which was very professional and seemed promising, in the mail. The best thing I can say is that it was hot. However... the pakoras were terrible - the onion was not cooked properly and the batter had an eggy consistency. They messed up our first dish, which was supposed to be fish in madras curry. Instead we received shrimp in some curry. The first thing I noticed was that it smelled like garbage. Upon further inspection I realized that the shrimp were rancid. The vegetarian dish was mediocre at best, the flavour resembled chef boyardee - sweet tomato sauce. There was no heat at all. The lamb dish was OK, the sauce was fine but the lamb was not great. The only thing that was actually good was the rice - fluffy and mixed with cumin seeds, and the naan was not shabby - not burned like other Indian restaurants.  We did go back the next day to return the rancid shrimp and they offered us a full refund, so at least they were polite about it. Too bad the food wasn't good - shape up, Amaya Express!!"}
{"text":"I go here to pick up lunch some weekdays. The Paneer Roti is my favourite and it's enough for two meals. In my experience, the chicken tends to be over cooked. I wouldn't recommend it for much more than lunch on the go, but if that's what you're going for it's reliable.   The decor fits with a fast-food place, clean and enjoyable but the feng shui is not that great. The staff are reserved, but friendly and helpful, unless you treat them like crap which I see a lot."}
{"text":"The guy is so weird and disrespectful, I ordered a single plate of Samomsa which comes with 2 samosa's and than gave me 2 plates and he kept saying no you ordered 2 plates and you have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Portion size ok. But chicken massla should have more than 3 tiny pieces of chicken in it"}
{"text":"There are a gauntlet of seedy bars on Queen East that you take your chances passing late at night.  But with the growing popularity of Leslieville, thankfully for us late night wanderers, those bars are rapidly disappearing. The neighbourhood's been abuzz since the former Teddy's closed its doors and rumours of Amaya opening an express location surfaced. Lucky for us, Amaya Express just opened two days ago.  Not having heard any reviews and eagerly awaiting their opening I thought I'd take the plunge. I've had Amaya from their other locations, and it is by far the best take-out/delivery Indian food I've had, so the bar has been set pretty high. I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. I was a bit early for my pick-up, but my order was ready within the 30 minutes.  They've done a nice, tidy renovation of the space. And while there are a few tables, the ambiance is not fantastic for dining - I'm sure they're focusing on take-out and delivery.  I ordered my Indian favourites - Chana Masala, Saag Paneer, vegetable pakoras, rice and naan. The total bill was $36.00. The mains are around $10 each, so its not super cheap, but it is reasonable. The portions are fantastic for the price. I thought I'd get maybe two dinners out of my order, but it will be more like three.  And since I love the food, I'll be okay eating it for a few days. The Chana Masala was lovely. Chickpeas nicely cooked. The sauce fragrant and mildly spicy. The Saag Paneer was perfect. Buttery spinach, not too rich. Good amount of paneer and the texture was good. Neither dish was too oily and while they were both nicely balanced with spices, neither was super spicy-hot, which is great. The pakoras were full of veggies, not greasy and very fluffy and yummy.   My only disappointment was the naan. It was just okay. Nothing special about it.  But I'll definitely be back. Its a wonderful addition to Leslieville."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews. Its edible, but not good. The butter chicken is cooked in what tastes like tomato sauce. Just get a burger."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Ordered the chicken kebab and it wasn't even edible. I had to remove the disgusting pieces of processed/ minced meat covered in spice that looked and tasted as if it was raw. I spent $8 on that and all I had was a lousy thick piece of bread with a few pieces of cucumber, tomato, onions and spices. Awful. I will never go there again. This was my second time and I had a similar experience at the square one location. I thought I'd give it a try as it could have been a one off but I was proven wrong. I'm sorry but their food is horrible!"}
{"text":"OK my fridge was empty and I just grabbed take out from Amaya on Davenport for the first time on July 22, 2013. I never go that way on Davenport; but it is literally downstairs from my building. The only way it could be any closer and more convenient for me is if it were actually in my building. I just have to traverse this little alley from Scollard to Davenport beside the house that looks like Easter threw up on it, and I'm there. I called to place my order in advance while perusing the menu online and I opted for the \"Royal Platter\" in honour of the British Royal family's \"crowning\" achievement today. In hindsight, Indian food also seems historically apt for this momentous occasion in the commonwealth.  The lady on the phone told me that it would be ready in about 10 - 15 minutes.  The menu did look a little pricey upon first glance; but my order ultimately wound up being a fair value. For $14.95 I got what I would consider a half order of butter chicken, a half order of lamb masala, a 3/4 order of channa masala and enough basmati rice pilaf and fresh naan bread for 2 people or 1 really hungry person with a King-sized appetite (at 5'9' and 165-ish lbs, I consider myself to have an average appetite).  I'm no pro on Indian cuisine; but I did work in an office full of connoisseurs on Indian food at my last job. What I learned from my old coworkers is the sauces and spice mixes are what it's all about, and these were very flavourful and rich. The selection in my order were obviously on the mild side (I had an angry spicy caribbean jerk chicken roti for lunch today and needed to calm things down a little for supper).  As I type this, I can't help but feel a little food pregnant with the Royal Platter and ready to take a nap in the fetal position."}
{"text":"Went there since they had a promotion for $7.99 chicken and rice bowl or something. I watched the girl scoop each scoop and putting some back in so I won't get extra chicken in the scoop. The bowl was not even half full and I paid 9.03 total for it. I am 5'6 130 and not full can you imagine an average person eating that? U are giving me a special not charity. The original bowl is like $8.xx and all you are doing is eliminating a few pieces of beans. The worst? They charge you cheap bottles of water for $2.50. Like really? I know the rent is high. If you need to charge me $15 for a meal so be it as it is a speciality but please don't leave me half full nor rip me off with a cheap bottle of water when I know it cost u 20 cents to buy it."}
{"text":"Just dropped in for a quick lunch - got the butter chicken, rice and naan.  Friendly, fast service (even though the place was empty) Food was brought over quickly in little copper vessels and man- I have had a lot of Indian food in my day and I was very surprised at how good it was. The rice was very tasty, perfectly cooked, and the chicken was moist and very flavourful.  Naan was great too - completely exceeded my expectations!  I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Food is decent, chefs/cooks are awesome, but servers are something to be experienced. I suggest you eat in, and listen to them complain and ridicule customers who call in. It's quite something. Imagine what they'll say about you when you're gone."}
{"text":"So the much anticipated Amaya Express opened its doors earlier this week.  We ordered take-out tonight for dinner, and were keen to see how the much talked about Amaya cuisine compared to some of our other Indian delivery options around here.  We had never had Amaya's food before.  We ordered the Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Samosas, Jasmine Rice, and 2 plain naans.  The total was around $42 including tax, and we picked up so not sure about any delivery charges that would apply.  The Chicken Tikka, in my opinion, was sparse for $12.  It was 5 pieces of chicken and a small cucumber salad garnish.  The flavours and seasonings were very good...spicy, but not overpowering.  The Butter Chicken was a better portion size, and also had very good flavours and seasonings.  The sauce was addictive, and we were glad we had enough rice and naan to justify eating it all.  The Samosas were pretty good, and standard, as were the rice and naans.   When I picked up our order, the staff were having trouble figuring out how to use their new machine to process my debit card so I ended up paying with Visa.  They also sent me out the door with someone else's order, and seemed to be having a bit of opening week jitters working out how to keep orders and tickets straight.  Our usual Indian delivery joint until now has been Real Taste of India.  Overall, I found the flavours and spices of Amaya's food were a little more balanced and tasty than Real Taste of India, but for $40-45 at Real Taste of India we get an additional main dish, and the overall portion sizes are bigger.  We can easily get two full meals for two people out of a Real Taste of India order...and that wasn't the case with our food from Amaya tonight."}
{"text":"Wish we looked at the reviews, we use to order from this place and the food was good but things have changed. We ordered palak paneer but got chicken in there, vindaloo use to have potatoes with the chicken but no more. Hope they go back to how it use to be!"}
{"text":"Vegi platter cost $19, way expensive 2 naan and 4 vegi. Overall not good experience, eaton center far good then yorkdale amaya restaurant."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I generally agree with previous reviews... :( Bland, overpriced and skimpy on paneer."}
{"text":"The food here is expensive for restaurant eating, let alone a food court -- average cost for a full meal for a single person with drink is about $15   The food is sweet -- not spicy --  almost a maple flavor across the board -- which was odd --  they need to fix their prices, as well as their flavor -- make it real -- and this will do well --"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night.  We had dinner delivered, and found our dishes overcooked, overpriced(!) and flavour-challenged.  The DO claim to use free-range chicken.  We may give them a second chance, but no time soon."}
{"text":"This place is in a food court so I wasn't expecting greatness. The service is brief but somehow managed to be dismal. I realize people don't want to be working in a food court but at least speak clearly instead of mumbling so we don't have to keep asking you to repeat things.  As for the food, the rice was on the dry side. Thankfully you get plenty of sauce with the butter chicken to make it palatable. It's mildly spicy and sweet, and the chicken is a bit overdone since it stays in the pot until it's all sold. The chickpeas were good and nothing stood out about them, for better or worse.  It was an okay meal. There are plenty of choices around there and I suggest you explore those."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality for a food court. I have ordered from here a couple of times in the past. I ordered the lamb thali. I was given 5 pieces of lamb which I thought was pretty good. I also got to pick 2 vegetarian dishes. I picked the yellow lentils which I was told was spicy but was quite mild. I also picked the saag paneer. Unfortunately there was no paneer in my container. It also comes with rice, raita and a mini salad. The portion was very filling. Cost was around $12. If you're in need of some spicy food at the mall I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I would call Amaya Express the McDonalds of Indian food in Toronto. It's not the best, but it's also not the worst.   Pros: Clean Tidy store front Seating Friendly staff  Fast take-out cuisine  Inexpensive  Nice takeout containers (I'm definitely going to reuse mine!)  Cons: Add ons are pricey (watch out ~$2.50+tax for naan) Simple food  While the food wasn't overly flavorful, it was very quick and reasonably priced. I don't think it's fair to expect sit down quality food at what is basically the drive-thru of Indian food.   I would go back again if I were in a hurry and in the area."}
{"text":"Became a fan of AE late this summer, and am more in love with their Curry chicken now than when I first tried it!  The Naan is AMAZING too!  It is a tad on the expensive side, but it's worth working into your budget if you love spicy Indian curry chicken like me!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place for cleanliness, customer service and food.    0 stars for Customer Service   I had the absolutely worst experience today at the Sherway Gardens location that I actually felt the need to post about this asap.    I used to be a huge fan of this place hence why choosing this place to eat today.   After ordering $50 worth of food, patiently waiting for four of the four items I was slowly starting to wonder what was taking so long.  The male who was slowly taking his time with the order had no clue whatsoever what he was doing as he kept asking what we wanted as there was a language barrier.  I am totally OK with someone not speaking English serving me as everyone has to make a living some how.  But regardless, he was being very slow and sloppy the food was running down the side of the containers.  After completing two of the four orders about 10 mins or more had passed.  Upon asking where the other two items were I was asked to see my receipt that wasn't given to me.  At this point I am very irritated,  so I said why do you need to see a receipt for the food I ordered if you have already completed two of the four orders!?... 'Sharon' (the woman told me her name was Sharon real or not) said she needed to see the receipt to prove that I ordered food,  while she could clearly pull it up on the register.  At this point I am very irritated and say ' I'm hungry, I would like to eat today and this isn't working out I would like my money back'.  She then starts to say I need the recipet I need the receipt I say  I want my money back!!!!!   SHARON THEN TELLS ME TO SHUT UP!   at this point I'm livid!!!!!    What kind of customer service is this?  What kind of establishment doesn't teach their employees to have customer service skills?.  I am very offended and very upset with that behavior as I have never encountered such rudeness from a place of business in my life!   She then tried to make it seem like it was my fault she told me to shut up.    I immediately called their head office and left a message for someone to call me back about the incident.  I will not take this lightly, as I believe this type of behavior shadows a business.   I will not tolerate or be spoken down to in any which manner.    If this is the business you would like to eat from going forward feel free to do so.I will not recommend this establishment (this location in particular ) I will also be sharing my review on other platforms to inform people of my experience today."}
{"text":"I received a total of $125 of git certificate for Amaya Indian Room from my boss around two years ago.  Since I am not a big Indian food fan, so didn't think of going until this weekend. When I was about to make a reservation online, found that it is closed and now is Amaya Express.  When I called the phone number on the gift certificate, the guy said it's no longer the same company, and they are not honouring the gift certificate. According to the online article from Toronto Star, Amaya Express is owned by the same owner.  Will never visit any of their locations again."}
{"text":"In the shopping mall food court, I love that I can try Indian food.   Where I live, we do not have many Indian restaurants, so I am not sure if this is very authentic Indian food or not, but at least foods our family tried were very delicious.  Price was about right for this kind of quality food."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would but the prices for their curry bowl is ridiculous. If I wanted authentic Indian food I can just go to Babu just up the street on16th. I do not like how the pressure you to buy their food when clearly it's over price. You're better off just going to another place in this location."}
{"text":"Too expensive for take out/ food court food!  If you're craving Indian, go to a sit down restaurant nearby and get better food and  probably pay the same amount."}
{"text":"Nice place in the food corner of the shopping mall. The place is clean and friendly and the food was great. Perfect fresh baked naan."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is always great and the prices okay... The staff is kind and always offers samples but on my most recent visit the sample offered must have been straight out of the pot and scalding hot. Gave my tongue a nasty burn. They gave me water, sure... but damage done.   Be very wary of the temperature of the samples no matter how the cup feels."}
{"text":"Decent food ... comparably priced to the other offers in the food court. The staff could learn to smile a bit!"}
{"text":"I've been longing to have an east indian roti  Sure, I live within walking distance of Little India but I have yet to find a place like Ghandi's or Mother India. I was delighted to see that Amaya's served a roti which sounded delicious:  spinach, edamame, sweet potato and spicy mayo. I ordered samosas and pakoras which were pretty tasty. The roti though was a disappointment. I neglected to notice that it had said \"roti wrap\" so the \"wrap\" was just a tortilla wrap. Not a nice, chewy, light roti shell like they make at Ghandi's & Mother India. It felt like I was just eating an indian wrap sandwich.  The filling tasted pretty decent so I might give this place another chance but try their curries.  I'm more inclined to just try the restaurants that I haven't been to yet in Little India because the prices are better there. In the meantime, my craving for a Ghandi's/Mother India-style roti will go unsatiated boo hoo hooo!"}
{"text":"It's not the best indian food ever, by its not the worst. Butter chicken was ketchupy in my opinion and not worst. I wasn't in the mood for other for fast food so I opted here. It's food court food so what's there to expect. It's decent enough for mall food. I'm just glad to see diverse flavours in a food court! But maybe I'd opt for other options, but it satisfies a quick craving.  Wouldnt go out of my way to eat here. But if you're in the mall and craving indian food for any reason, then try it."}
{"text":"I paid $7.45 plus tax ($8.50) for the daily Tuesday special. I got the butter chicken.   Half the take out box was plain rice. With 6 pieces of chicken (bite sized). RIDICULOUS.   You expect me to pay $8.50 for a few bites of chicken with sauce? I can get Indian food elsewhere for less with DOUBLE THE PORTION.   This place used to give lots. They are just cheating out now. Very bad.   And the guy tried to argue with me that I get what I paid for. So you are telling me I'm paying $1 per bite of chicken for food court quality?   Bullshit..."}
{"text":"I love the food from here- but man does it add up. I don't know how- but on average when I pick up for two people it's about $65 However- it's delicious and I love it. The service is good too. I only do takeout- not a fan of their dine in area... Seems like a bit of an afterthought..."}
{"text":"they really need to get their act together there!  their receipt printing machine was NOT working for a month, which is no good when you need to submit your receipt to work for everyone's order...  plus their kitchen looks to be a hawtttt mess!!! the two guys were in there sweating and bumping into one another with pans...  our lunch took over an hour when i specifically asked for the food to be done by noon with an hour notice...  noone was happy about this."}
{"text":"Had a butter chicken and chickpea bowl with one piece of Nan for $13.00. It was okay, and the butter chicken was decent, but certainly not the best in the downtown core. Its fine, if you really have a craving for Indian at the Eaton Centre, but there are much better options (Like King Palace), within a short subway ride or a 20 minute walk."}
{"text":"Amaya Express is my go-to take out place for quick Indian food. I'm not a fan of spicy food at all, so I am always cautious when ordering cuisine known for being spicy. Lots of then Indian restaurants I've ate at promised mild but the dish still came out spicy. What can I say? I'm a wuss. The menu has been toned down for a Canadian palate, which is the reason I like it. I'm Canadian and the only spice I grew up with was Mrs.Dash. Not to say that they don't offer spicy dishes for those that like them, the menu still offers classic spicy dishes, like the chicken tikka masala.   Portion sizes are big; 2 people could split one order and be full. I always order the butter chicken (all white meat!) and garlic naan, both of which are great. You need to spend a minimum of $30 for delivery but with the prices seeming slightly higher than average that may be easy to accomplish."}
{"text":"Basic food... too expensive... and not even tasty! Moreover there is 0% chances that you'll get a seat so that you can eat in peace... because their seating arrangement is too bad!"}
{"text":"Never again! Normally I read reviews. This time I didn't and wish I had. Naturally assumed it would be good since there is a proper Amaya restaurant near my place. Likely the worst choice in this food court, or they could very well all be bad. All the dishes were cold probably because they were sitting in buffet style vats all week. Tough chunks of meat. Not much flavour at all, except for the butter chicken which tasted a lot like tomato sauce. That would have been great if for Italian cuisine, but not here. \"Fresh\" garlic naan was cold and flavourless. Came out in 30 sec so can't imagine it's all that fresh. My dish included naan. When I went to order they said if I wanted the \"REAL\" naan and opposed to store bought pita, It cost extra. Sneaky. Filthy tables and seats covered in rice an sauce. Next time I'll trust my gut and stick to my usually spot JOEY or eat away from mall."}
{"text":"I was really really hungry so maybe this is the hungeer talking at the time but I worfed down all the food like it was my last meal. Holy Jesus it was pretty good, wouldn't say it was great or anything but it was definately not bad.  I had the Vegetable Thali which ended up being like $14 and I had half and half white rice and saffron rice, the eggplant chef special, yogurt curry, and paneer. The paneer I thought was lovely and not extremely watery like other places I've eaten at. The yogurt curry was interesting because the chunks in it tasted like KFC chicken bits surprisingly enough lmao, I unfortunately did not bother asking clearly what was in the yogurt curry. The eggplant chef special was okay I wouldve preffered all of my eggplant pieces to NOT have the stems on them lol was a pain in the ass to eat.  Idk if the rice was fragrant or not or maybe it was more of a subtle thing and my tastebuds were overidden by hunger. The naan that came with however was chewy. I'm 100% sure it was microwaved or just left out to dry for days on end because I did let it cool down a little because it was too hot l. The texture was goss and gummy until I dipped it into the curries to soften it up and it became a million times more enjoyable, but still gross. I just didnt want to waste food. Also the yogurt and salad that came with it was really refreshing and overall the meal made me really full.  Probably would come here when Im starving again, Other times? Probably not."}
{"text":"I stopped by at the Eaton Centre food court to grab some food inbetween my conference. The selection was so wide in terms of restaurants. I was craving Indian food so I checked out Amara Express- I chose to have a combo of Shahi Paneer with rice and a small garden salad to go (10$), with a Perrier my combo came out to 15$. The restaurant was generous with the amount of rice but I only saw 5 pieces of Paneer! Really?! I'm not paying  for meat here! Regardless I thought this was too pricey for 5 pieces of cheese! The flavours were good though.  Next time you're craving Indian food - stick to a proper restaurant that gives you larger portions that match their pricing!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but the prices have gone up and the portions have gone down since my last visit. We ordered the butter chicken, chana masala, rice and naan to go and it wasn't enough food to satisfy 2 people. The butter chicken was flavourful but hardly any chicken floating around in all that sauce. There also was a big thick dark hair (not mine) in my meal which was quite nasty. I ended up raiding my fridge for food scrapes after we finished off our amaya order."}
{"text":"Food was not bad My issue with this place is the so called daily special It was a Tiesday & I ordered the Chicken Madras which in the menu featuring the specials was 7.49 Beside this menu was the regular menu showing Chicken Madras at 8.85 When I got to the cash I was asked if it was the \"regular\" or the \"special\" i asked what the difference was & she explained what the regular comes within addition to the entree Seems to me for the small diffrrence in price the regular should be the special as it seems to come with a lot more for a small difference. To call the dish I took the Special seems very misleading if not in fact dishonest. Like I said the food quality & quantity is not the issue & my dish was probably 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I found the food really, really bland. I din't have high expectations for an express place, but it was pretty subpar for my expectation of even mediocre food. :("}
{"text":"Literally the WORST service I've ever had!  I work in the mall, and absolutely love Indian food.  I ordered the veggie samosas, an extra side of garlic naan and a side of butter chicken sauce.  They argued with me for not wanting to give me the side of sauce, then charged me $2.50 for a small, half-filled cup of just sauce (no actual chicken).  It came to almost $12 for everything.    Deciding to give them a 2nd try, I came back a couple days later.  I ordered just the side of garlic naan and side of butter chicken sauce.  This time, I was given dirty looks by both the cashier and the girl serving me, and charged $4.94 for the small cup of sauce.  It came to over $7 for the 2 items.  I requested that the cup be filled completely if I was going to be charged this amount, and got an attitude from the cashier.    I would not recommend this place to any regular customers.  The service seems like its meant for a tourist area, not mall employees or people who live locally wanting Indian food.  The items I tried off the menu tasted okay, but I will NOT return simply because the service was so bad both times.  I am new to Toronto and have tried many restaurants since moving here, and none have the despicable service this place has."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, I was craving indian so I decided to give it a try. I had inquiries on what the contents were but both people behind the counter seemed annoyed as if I have inconvenienced them. For the price I paid I could have ate something much better. They should at least offer customer service if their food is going to be meh."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place because a new Amaya Express opened in our neighbourhood on king east just past Sherbourne. After waiting for over 2 hrs after being promised the food in 1.5 hrs, we found out the food was coming from this location. To our dismay, it was pricey, cold, small portions and the chicken was so undercooked it was bleeding. I never take photos of food nor have the time to do so but I decided to this time to warn potential customers of the health hazards of this place. Trust me, my stomach is feeling it. I called Amaya Express back and demanded a resolution, and even suggested driving the chicken back to the location if proof was needed. I will never go back to this restaurant again and I hope nobody else has to go through what I just went through"}
{"text":"Dry, chalky Butter Chicken. Very yummy sauce. Next time I would just get the butter chicken sauce and make my own chicken. Bland Aloo Gohbi (I didn't know there was such a thing). Way too expensive for the quality. Don't waste your money; go explore Little India if you're craving some spice."}
{"text":"The box meals consist of a few teaspoons of curry with a pound of rice.  The samosa's were not fresh and everything was slopped all over the container.  The salad was a thimble of vegetables that tasted like chemicals.  The order was of unacceptable quality therefore called the restaurant who refused to assist and couldn't care less about customer service or satisfaction.  Use to be my favourite restaurant but I won't have my family treated with such disrespect as I experienced on the phone and $70 worth of food that's a complete disaster."}
{"text":"I should have avoided this place given all the poor reviews, but I was given a free $20 Wagjag voucher for this place, so I decided why not give it a chance?  Big mistake.  So the voucher said this on it (I still have the electronic copy so this is verbatim): - Limit 1 voucher per visit - Valid only at the location selected (Yorkdale Mall: 3401 Dufferin Street) - Not valid with other promotions - Must print voucher and present at time of visit. Electronic vouchers are not accepted - Does not include tax or gratuity. No cash value. No cash back  I always read the fine print and nowhere did it say that you must order from the dinner menu and that you cannot order from the lunch menu.  So I was there at lunch time with my parents.  So I ordered from the lunch menu.  We ordered an order of Butter Chicken, an order of Masala Lime Lamb, and an order of Amaya Prawns.  When I went to pay (we were doing takeout so it was shortly after ordering), the cashier charged me the dinner prices which were $4 more for each plate than the lunch prices.  I asked her why and she said it was because I was using the Wagjag voucher.  There was a huge lineup behind me (I have no idea why this place was so busy) and we were so hungry, I didn't care to argue with her, so I just paid it and took our orders out to the food court.  WTF?  I'm charged the dinner prices at lunchtime because I'm using a voucher?  And I'm pretty sure I wasn't given dinner-sized portions because the portions were pretty dinky.  So I had to pay over $20 on top of the $20 voucher (the total food bill was over $40 - for 3 dinky portions and no beverages).       So maybe the food is actually good...wrong!  It's not good at all.  The shrimp (prawns) tasted disgusting to me.  They were mushy.  How in the world do you make shrimps mushy?  I have no idea.  They definitely did not taste fresh.  My parents were not crazy about the butter chicken or masala lamb either.  What a waste of money and calories.      If someone were to give me a free voucher for this place again, I would actually decline it."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Amaya Express in the past and enjoyed it, but clearly it has changed. On top of having to wait 1 1/2 for our order to arrive, the food was very disappointing. Luke warm and tasted like it had been reheated, particularly the fried foods. Butter chicken sauce was very different than in the past. Naan bread soggy. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I got the chana masala and butter chicken over yellow jasmine rice. The bowl had a very generous serving for one - you will definitely be full after this meal. I enjoyed the chana masala and the butter chicken sauce. I found that the butter chicken was a drier than what I had expected. I have not tried butter chicken from an authentic Indian restaurant so I am by no means a professional. However, customer service was quick and at its price point, it was okay but it definitely fills you up!"}
{"text":"Nobody was more excited than me to see the neon elephant that marked the spot where the new Amaya Express was to be opened in Leslieville. I'd dutifully check the menu on their website to plan my dream meal, then waited for my first chance to order it up, big time. Last night was my chance. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but it wasn't too good.  A few friends and I planned a little dinner party last night and felt if would be a perfect time to try out the new AE. We decided to order the dinner for four, knowing it would be lots of food, but we were looking forward to stuffing our faces with this food that everyone seemed to be raving about! The total came out to $95 with tax--very steep for Indian food in general and very steep for take out! But I'm more than willing to pay above average money for above average food.  My first tip off that the experience wasn't going to be above average was the actual restaurant. The website for Amaya Express is very upbeat, bright and playful, with happy music playing and a modern interface; the signage outside is great--that flaming orange elephant is a great logo. But when I walked inside, it was like I was walking into a 19th C. bordello. The lights were very dim and there was a red hue in the air. A little eccentric, I thought, but continued to pay and pick up the food.  Here's a breakdown of what we ordered and how I thought it tasted:  Saag Paneer--this was ok. Had a nice spinach flavour, but the cheese  cubes were gigantic and had a dry texture. So the cheese to sauce ratio was off. I had to cut the pieces into four more pieces. This fixed the ratio, but the pieces were still dry and watery tasting--oxymoron, I know, but that's how i can describe it!  Matar Paneer--this dish was more flavourful than the saag paneer; however it still had the problem with the huge chunks of dry cheese. Why did I have to choose two paneer dishes??? Oh well.  Butter Chicken--the butter chicken was definitely the best part of the meal. The sauce was flavourful and there was plenty of chicken in the mix. Not the best I've ever had--and definitely not worth the price--but worthy of a reorder.  Chicken Korma--I usually LOVE korma; however, this one was very disappointing. I don't know how to describe the flavour, because there was none. It was like tasting air. There was NO FLAVOUR! ha ha. I'm almost glad it was so bad, because the next time I have a good chicken korma it will taste that much better in comparison.  Masala Lime Lamb--other than the butter chicken, this was the only other dish to elicit a couple compliments at the table. Very nicely cooked lamb, good sauce.   Beef Vindaloo--I'd rank this in between the korma and the masala lamb for appeal. While it had flavour and heat, it was missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. It just didn't have a depth of flavour I would crave and keep me coming back for more.  The naan was very thick and spongy, which I don't think is a good thing. When I'd pair it with the sauces, the flavour of the bread would over power the sauce. Get that! How can the flavour of bread over power the spice juggernaut that is Indian food??? Disappointing.  I'm done with the satisfaction of eating copious amounts of Indian food at buffets and ignoring my puke reflex just because it was cheap. I really want excellent tasting Indian food at a fair price (reasoning that price should dictate quality). I am sad to say my hopes were dashed last night. So dramatic, hey??? I am now on a mission to find the best Indian food in Toronto. And I want everyone to set the record straight on this issue--no more rewards for mediocrity."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken poutine. Was ambitious. But lacked a lot. I think this place is over priced. Lots of fries. Lots of gravy. Very chintzy with their meat portion. I will not be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"I hate the guys who are working there, before I never miss to have something to eat on Amaya in Eton centre, I like there , and I like there service, but I don't like Amaya on Yorkdale mall, the guys are rude, they don't talk polite and they show costumers attitude, I don't wish to go there anymore, and I advice to my friends don't try Amaya on Yorkdale"}
{"text":"Excellent takeout, my go-to for Indian food. I've never been disappointed by Amaya and my friends from India love it."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this Amaya, the first was during the opening week of the Yorkdale food court, and to say I'm disappointed is like saying Rob Ford having to miss football and sit at a council meeting and maybe even having to pay attention.  I've always felt there'd be a huge market for tasty fast food Indian at hawker stand prices.  If all you can eat buffets can dominate the Yonge St. Clair area, surely you could do it cheaper at a food court right?  Sadly this place charges more than the sit downs I've been to, and managed to provide some supremely disappointing food.  Had the butter chicken where the sauce was thinner than a runway model after a night of purging.  The 7 cubes of chicken was so dry I actually choked on it a bit.  Oh I'm not quite sure exactly what the literally two table spoons of salad was.  The corn was actually shriveled like me after a cold shower or watching episodes of golden girl followed by Rita McNeil (I'm sorry that was mean.. but not as much as the damn salad).  Won't somebody think of the children?"}
{"text":"I was jonesing for some Indian food on my last trip to Toronto.  I know there is a high concentrating of Indian people in Toronto/Southern Ontario, and all that was needed was to follow my nose to their outrageously scented but delicious cuisine.  A food court wasn't the idea I had when I pictured stuffing my face with Indian food, but what a food court they have in the Eaton Center!  I had some kind of a spicy chicken curry with chick peas and yellow rice.  It was all very good, but the garlic butter naan was the best part.  You need to buy the naan bread separate, but you won't be disappointed if you do.  Spending the rest of the day smelling like a bag of boiled onions and cumin was the collateral damage, but still worth it."}
{"text":"Took take out from this place a week ago(couldnt geg around to write a review before) and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food"}
{"text":"This was an amazing Chaat Paapri. I asked them to make it extra spicy and wow the ratio of onions, masalas, veggies and chickpeas on top of a perfect bed of paapris was heavenly."}
{"text":"Wouldnt give the mall discount to me (despite working at the office building) when literally every other food court restaurant that offered the discount would. Chicken Madras was extremely salty and dry even though it was drenched in sauce. No wonder this place is empty most of the time."}
{"text":"This was our sixth time ordering from this restaurant.  Normally we order from them through JustEat, but this time we had a Groupon so i went and picked it up. This restaurant is usually 4.5 stars. The food is delicious and the portion sizes generous. It's a bit pricy when all is said and done, so we usually stick to Spring Rolls (which never fails us).   The reason for the three stars is that this visit was a 2 star. My criticism is that unlike every other time when the containers were pretty much filled right up, this time they were barely half full. I really hope that this had nothing to do with the fact that we had a groupon, as that is not a way to make and keep new customers. We will try Amaya again, but if there is anymore inconsistencies in portion size we'll have to pass and look for another place to get our Indian food fix."}
{"text":"Sigh..... I love indian food but wtf? This was kinda sad. My friend and I got really hungry in the middle of shopping so we hopped into the food court to see what was up. It had been awhile since I visited Markville mall and this place wasn't there in the past so I decided to give it a try. My friend got butter chicken with regular rice and saag paneer. I got coconut curry chicken with saffron rice and saag paneer. We were also really thirsty so both of us got a mango lassi to try.  The food looked better than it tasted. From the first bite we noticed everything was kinda lukewarm and not very fresh. Idk if it's a regular portion size, but we felt that the girl serving us was super stingy. My friend got like 4 pieces of chicken in his butter chicken and there were so many bay leaves in my coconut curry. The saffron rice was good. Tasted way better than the regular rice which was hella bland. The saag paneer was frankly, a disaster. I spat out my first bite and so did my friend. I know what good saag paneer should taste like and this one tasted nasty. Maybe they used old spinach or cheese to make it? It was actually sour af. Holy hell. Yea, for all you ppl adventurous enough to try this place. BEWARE. Don't order the saag paneer here.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the mango lassi. It was surprisingly not bad (far from an excellent one).  If you want good indian food, there are a couple of great spots in thornhill or around denison (if you're in markham). Skip this place altogether imo."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  The cook seems to take a lot of care with his food and the ingredient quality is very good.  Had the lamb biryani and the lamb was excellent.  The rice was okay, but flavours were lacking."}
{"text":"We used Just-Eat.ca to order food from Amaya Express.  Being Indian in Toronto, we're usually very skeptical about ordering-in Indian food.  But being lazy and craving Indian food on a Friday night, we ordered from Amaya Express, and it was delicious!!!!  I would even go as far as naming Amaya it the \"Best Indian Restaurant in Toronto\".   We ordered the 'Mixed Grill for two' as appetizers .. which included kabab, chicken, and prawn - all were scrumptious (and goes really well with scotch & soda - if you're Indian, you know what I'm talking about - 'short eats'!)  The meats all retained their moisture, and weren't dry at all on delivery.  We also ordered the Madras Curry Braised Lamb - which was super-flavorful, savory, had just the right amount of spice, and the lamb piece was amazingly tender! We had it with the garlic naan (not overly garlicy, just right, and still warm).  Thinking we hadn't ordered enough, we also got the Chicken Biryani - that was a bit of an overload, as we were just too stuffed to eat anymore.  The Biryani was good, although the cardamon aroma was a bit over-powering.  Nevertheless, our whole in-house dining experience was great - and we're hoping to order from Amaya every week (they even gave us a $15 coupon on our next order) - thank you Amaya!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon coupon where I paid $15 and could order up to $45. It was a fantastic deal and we ordered a lot of food.  The Food: It came with the daily chef's appetizer, which I believe was the leek parsnip fritters. That was very good and we enjoyed it very much. For the main dishes, we ordered the butter chicken and the curried spinach. I love butter chicken. Whenever I go to an Indian restaurant, I simply have to order it. However, this tomato-based curry version wasn't to my taste. The naan we ordered was really good as was the rice. I also ordered the mango and fennel lassi. The fennel was a surprising ingredient and made the drink stand out. I enjoyed it a lot.  The Place: The restaurant is very small with only a few tables. Honestly, when you walked in, it looked like it used to be a Pizza Pizza or something with a dining area added in next to it. However, it was clean and the decor was simple and modern.  The Service: The service was fantastic. The waiter was very polite and attentive.  The Verdict: The only things that stood out for me were the leek parsnip fritters and the mango lassi so I probably wouldn't come here again. I'm on the hunt for the perfect butter chicken. Any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to eat on this street and after leaving my phone number with a few other restaurants I smelt this place in the air and hunted around until I found it. I came back the next night and was a little worried as there were no customers inside. It smelt so good that despite the lack of a crowd I decided to roll the dice. I ordered butter chicken and beef vindaloo to go. After getting home I was blown away by how good both dishes were. The butter chicken tasted like it's suppose to and the vindaloo burnt my Caucasian palate appropriately. The meat was well cooked in large chucks and not shitty cuts (no fat or gristle). It is a little bit more expensive than your typical hole in the wall ($33 for 2 meat dishes + rice) but considering the taste and I didn't have to get aquatinted with the bathroom multiple times the next day, I'd do it again."}
{"text":"staff s nice and sincere. food is average,I've been to other mayas where the food tasted better feel like some dishes are not as great as other amaya's... butter chicken can sometimes be dry in terms of the meat and too tomatoey... quality assurance could go up in terms of taste but staff is very pleasant and great service"}
{"text":"Very decent portion sizes from a wide menu with quick delivery times make this my go to Indian delivery place. A little pricier than most places but when I order delivery I'd rather pay a little extra for the quality.  The curried onion pakora is just amazing."}
{"text":"The butter chicken is my favorite curry/sauce (but the chicken itself is a bit dry) The naan bread is amazing!! It's freshly made in that stone oven thing (not a heated up naan bread from the toaster) I love the garlic naan, they also have plain and butter naan.  And it also comes with salad or chick peas, seems healthy :)  I have tried the other curries but they are not as memorable, stick to the butter chicken, yum!  The homemade mango drink at the counter where you pay, grab one! Worth it! Goes perfect with the curries."}
{"text":"Hot fresh spicy and warming a cold day in Toronto.  Yorkdale mall is a maze if you're from out if town. Lots of high end shops and services  Lots of seating but very busy   I ordered the chicken madras with the chickpeas and 2 waters. . 16$ worth it to fill the empty tummy and freshen up from the warm walk with a winter jacket....  Which was a mistake.   Love the Yorkdale mall!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and I was hungry for Indian food after passing through the Indian parade.  Customer service to me was fine.  I really dont expect people who live in Toronto to be friendly anyways.   Food was awesome. Mango Lassi, Naan and chicken Tikka masala.  Hot and delicious"}
{"text":"Atrocious on almost all levels. Complete apathy of service, almost borderline rude. Food was sub par, my usual favorite dish of Matar Paneer was almost inedible I threw most of it away. I would mention pricing but honestly if the food was good I wouldn't be too upset but $20+ for a terrible meal isn't good value. Change your attitudes and your chefs."}
{"text":"They told us we had 20 mins to order because they were closing. We ordered. Food didn't arrive until 30 ish mins later because they were tending to the take out orders. We sat there for a very long time...hungry. It was after we got our food that the waitress gave us the rushing vibe. I know they were aware that they were taking a really long time to give us our food, so why not give us some naan bread to help make the wait a little easier? Customer service really lacks here. If you're here I'd recommend going to another restaurant that's nearby."}
{"text":"Yikes...  how should I begin?  We've had a good experience at the Yorkdale Amaya but this was different. There's a reason why they're on Groupon and there isn't a line up on a Friday night whereas Thai express, Harvey's, etc do. The butter chicken was not bad but when we asked about the cauliflower curry being spicy (we were dining with our son) and the guy said that it wasn't at all, at all means 0 to me, not 1. So it may be a 1-2 for adults but for a kid, it was FIRE. The naan breads were like the supermarket naans, and then there were the samosas...  I would have to say they were the worst samosas I've ever had.  The pastry looked undercooked and the filling was just... I can't even describe. My husband had it first and said it was terrible. I gave it a try since I thought, \"how bad can it be?\"  It was that bad. Couldn't swallow it. The potato patty thing was just as bad. Too bad. The Groupon deal was a good one. Won't be buying another one."}
{"text":"I went here about two weeks ago, because the line up at the glow press and the burriito place didn't entice me.  I had:  Two Kathi Rolls. One with chicken and one with lamb.  THe lamb was the best, hands down.  THe only qualms were that I thought it was way too expensive.  Its just a small chapati with like a tablespoon or two of curry, a few diced pieces of onion and some letture. Is that really worth two for ten? Should be more like two for five..  The rose-lemonade was really good. Im guessing the made it the same way I always did growing up...Rooh Afzah syrup with lemon. Its the best. Like legit. My favourite thing that's come from pakistan.  I might come back, but its expensive.  Whats with the city and all this expensive indian food?  Indian food is supposed to be cheap and yummy.  .end rant."}
{"text":"Ordered food online. Took over 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive.  The food arrived cold and the order was incorrect.  Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This amaya express, although in a food court, blows my mind. The guys that work here are so so so friendly, and always offer me samples when I'm looking at the menu or just walking by. You know that if you are living the vegan lifestyle, you need to be super careful when eating out, especially in a food court. I had already made my rounds around markville's food options but found nothing appealing. What is so hard to get that vegans can eat more than a salad?? Life's rough.   I went over to amaya, because if anything I can get some rice and call it a day. I'm hangry as hell at this point. I approach with caution because I am so awkward that I may end up buying everything even if I can't eat any of it just because I feel bad that they have to talk to me. First, I don't like mentioning the word 'vegan' when ordering in ordinary restaurants/food places because I always feel weird and don't want that special spotlight on me. They have several deals and they told me I could choose a combo with one rice, one meat and a veggie. I chose the biryani rice, which looked bomb af. I hesitantly asked if I could only choose one veggie and no meat because I only saw the curried chick peas and the rest of the vegetables looked like they were swimming in dairy-based sauce. The guys insisted on me choosing another vegetable to get the best out of the deal and when I declined, they gave me a reassuring smile and told me that it's vegan. Phew, avoided that awkward situation! I ended up getting this eggplant dish along with my chick peas and rice. Oh, and also warm warm naan bread. Yum! The biryani rice drenched with the sauce from the chick peas was warming to my stomach and in return it thanked me for carbing the f up.   Everything was delightful and I'd definitely return to amaya for more food court meals when I'm hangry next. (It was a tiny bit oily, but so is all food when you eat out)"}
{"text":"FAKE INDIAN FOOD, BLAN AS BREAD, WAAY OVER PRICED AND ABSOLUTELY the WORSTTTTTT Indian food I've ever had in my life. LET ME EXPLAIN- I got the butter chicken bowl which included rice, channa masala and butter chicken. Which all sounds like a pretty good deal for $11 right? Maybe if it included something more because the portion was tiny!!! It was the size of a to-go soup take out bowl. if they're gonna make it so expensive at least include naan or a drink or SOMETHING.  And that's not even the end of it- if you are looking for authentic Indian food DO NOT eat here. sweet chilly heat Doritos is spicier than Amaya's food. I never thought I'd see the day I'd try blan Indian food, but congrats Amaya, you made it happen. BLAN AS BREAD.   All in all it's fake Indian food that's wayyyy over priced for a fricken fast food restaurant.  If I could give this place a 0/10 I would"}
{"text":"Amaya Express and its sister restaurant used to be fantastic. No more. Expensive, poorly seasoned, odd off-flavours, minimal meat in the curries, soggy/tough naan ... never again."}
{"text":"Would have given a zero if I had the option. Worst Indian food ever! It seemed like there was no dish to redeem it. Palak Paneer 0/5. Chana Masala 0/5. Dal Makhani 1/5. Naan 2/5. Chicken Biriyani -1/5. And the aloo tikki was a -5/5."}
{"text":"I asked them for their most flavorful meal because, in the past, all I've ever had was bland, soupy chicken, rice and fries.  For 8.95, i thought I'd be getting a meal, not something that was the size of a side dish for a baby!    When I first saw the portion size I said, That's WAY too small of a meal for a price like that... (the manager or whoever he was) then offered to add naan bread for an additional $1. WOW thanks! I didn't know I could get more food for MORE MONEY! What a goofball!   Rather than humor me and put in a tad more rice or a chunk of chicken, he went into some lame schpeal about how its REAL CHICKEN, like that was something I didn't expect  \"I can't give more, this is real chicken! unlike the aardvark meat and sloth milk we use to use!\"  I told him,  I couldn't eat that for lunch... but that wasn't the end of it.    He then went on a rampage of interrogation and intimidation.  He said, \"you should have told me before, now its going to be waste!\"  He was trembling with anger.  I stood there in disbelief and asked, \"What are you doing right now?? Are you trying to force me to buy this? Are you ACTUALLY trying to intimidate me here?\" \"If you had told me before, then it would be okay for you to leave.\" he responded.   Folks, Is this guy kidding me? How the fudge could I have known what the portion size was before I got to see the portion size??  I told him I would never buy food there again, then I went to Pita Land across the street and got twice as much food with beverage for $8.  Up his!"}
{"text":"Prepaid everything with my creditcard and included a tip for delivery. When i got my food and reciept someone had circled the 3 dollar service fee for using justeat.com and wrote in blue pen that the fee goes to the restaurant and then also circled my amount that i left for tip indicating that portion goes to driver. I felt super insulted like they were basically saying my tip wasn't good enough and next time they wanted more money. The restaurant isn't that far from my house either! I could've easily went and picked up the food and avoided the service fee and the delivery tip but i didn't.  I'm just really upset that someone had the nerve to do that to my family- i just had a baby and I'm on maternity leave so i don't have a surplus of extra tip money laying around but atleast i made an effort. Where's my thank you for buisness? Unreal!"}
{"text":"Very bad quality food! I thought differently about Amaya before but I'm sure I was wrong. Portion of rice was so small as if they were doing us a favor, we even paid for that, later realising how dry the rice had become, it hurt to eat that! The Madras chicken curry: awful, tasted of tamarind and nothing else, the chicken was so overcooked that the chicken died so many deaths over after getting cooked! Heights of wrong cooking. Atleast I'm not going there again ever let alone recommend it to not even my worst enemy. Beef curry: spicy overcooked beef chunks which still had sinews on it, chewy and spicy goo. Like these guys love to overcook/kill their proteins it seems. Somebody please stop them!"}
{"text":"Convenient, quick, excellent service.  Delivery or pick-up, this place has very palatable Indian food.   While I will admit, I believe it has been 'toned down' so to speak, to better appeal to the Canadian palate, I still think it maintains its integrity.   The portions are quite generous, and while the price is probably slightly higher than comparables, it's also tastier.   The garlic Naan is a MUST!"}
{"text":"With a strong aroma of Indian curry and spice coming from Amaya Express, I thought it would be a nice change for some cultural food, other than the usual Chinese, Thai, burgers, or sandwiches that I eat so often. Definitely a nice addition to the Urban Eatery.  Ordering the butter chicken, you have a choice of either the rice or the naan bread. You're asked if you want chick peas in your bowl as well. It came to $7.90 after tax, pricey when it isn't even a combo.   The chicken itself wasn't all that exciting. It was a dry, flavourless, chunk of chicken. What made up for it was the butter chicken sauce. It was flavourful, spicy and made me yearn for more. It went great with the naan bread. The chick peas was also a welcoming addition, so definitely say yes to that option.  I would be back to try those samosas though!"}
{"text":"I wish I had seen these reviews before choosing to  eat Amaya Express.  Service: AWFUL. The people working at Amaya were very rude. The man I ordered from was impatient and curt, and the cashier was rude - I paid with an AMEX card (which didn't tap when we both tried, leading her to tell me to insert it into the machine), and once it went through, she waved a little sign placed at the side of the cash register saying that they don't accept AMEX. Um, I didn't see it, AND she even held my card and tried to tap it giving her the opportunity to see it was an AMEX.   Food: Okay. As others have said, nothing special.   Avoid this place altogether."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Amaya Express and would not recommend. I went at lunch on a weekday and the service was not great, staff were rude, and the food was sub-par."}
{"text":"I also picked up some takeout for dinner. i guess everyone does cause there was no one sitting and eating. A fair amount of takeout orders it seems, must be good to have justeat website.  For a place that is said to be 'express', well they were quite quick. i went in, ordered, was out of there in short order. But the other aspect I had hoped was a slightly lower price point given it's a takeout fast food type. I really couldn't get out of there with dinner for 2 for under $40.  The food though is quite good. I had the spinach curry (saag) with chicken which was a good size portion. Chicken pieces you could tell just added, as it didn't have too much flavor.  I liked watching the cook make the naan though, was a really cool process. He takes a small piece of dough, stretches and flips it back and forth kindaa like pizza. Then he put it on some tool to stick to the side of this naan oven.  They also have pakoras, but it wasn't on the menu. I'm no expert on Indian cuisine, but for my non-expert taste I quite liked them as an appetizer.  The place though seems very sterile, clean to eat in but not very warm and welcoming. I guess they're going for the order, eat, leave thing."}
{"text":"I looove this place. I've been ordering here for the last two years. They are very fast and pleasant when it comes to switching items. Their chicken biryani is probably one of the best in town believe it or not. The vegetarian platter is excellent same with the chicken tikka masala. The samosas are a bit dry but not too bad."}
{"text":"We ordered it, we ate it...we're probably not coming back.  With Maggie E on the dry butter chicken (I didn't even think it was possible to have dry butter chicken, but this place managed it).  Packaged naan from PC would have been better than we were got here.  We also had the beef Korma (I didn't know that Korma could be bland!)  They were quick though - what do I expect for food prepared within 10 minutes...something better that dried meat tossed in sauce.  My experience here actually reminded me that I should make the drive to Etobicoke to my fave Indian place."}
{"text":"Flavourless, not fresh, buffet style food. I wish I saw the reviews on here because I just wasted $15 on what was a 4 veg option that you would usually get at any restaurant for under $10 and at least it's fresh. They charged me extra for not taking the Chana masala which made no sense. Plus the naan isn't real Indian naan. Prices should be 1/2 the price for what they are dishing out."}
{"text":"This may very well be the most overpriced restaurant I've been to. The portions are tiny--my chicken kebab appetizer featured two pieces on my kebab; the fish and prawn curry featured three pieces of fish and two prawns for twenty dollars. The food we did get was excellent, but we left hungry. Even the coconut rice pudding servings were scanty--and we're talking bout a cheap dish of milk and rice, here! My husband ordered a pop and was charged for the refill--three dollars each! The decor is nice, the service is good, but for the kind of profit they must be making, it damn well ought to be."}
{"text":"Great food. Very flavourful. Naan bread is excellent and the sauces are always rich. Only reason it is 4 Stars as opposed to 5 is because it's a bit pricey and the delivery can take some time"}
{"text":"We eat here often.  We have always had very good service.  We eat plant based and find the food tasty and portions plentiful.   It is fast Indian food.  It's a good place for a quick and filling lunch."}
{"text":"I concur with the other reviewers and would give this place a 0 if I could.  Food was small in portions and not filling at all for the price you pay.    I didn't ask for their naan bread but they said that they will give it to me.  Being that it was 10 min before closing I thought it was free.  They then charged me for it hoping I wouldn't notice.   Not the type of business I want to support."}
{"text":"Okay business, felt the price was reasonable.  The food was a little more than I expected (in a good way).  But it was filling and I will probably go back there again.  Three stars because it's not the best place to grab Indian food, but it's also not the worst."}
{"text":"For mall food, this was alright. Good Indian food, quite flavourful. I had the daily special - Chicken Madras. The chicken breast pieces were tender. The only thing is they put a lot of rice, only a few pieces of chicken and drowned it in sauce."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid avoid the butter chicken poutine at all costs.  If you've got a hankering for butter chicken poutine read this review and weigh the pros and cons should you find yourself at Yorkdale Mall and in desperate need of a poutine fix.  I've had their butter chicken and it's not bad.  It's good the first few bites and then it just turns into a chore to finish the rest.    While the place is nestled into a little cafe-like area, the lack of customers should have told me to not order the poutine as the fries would not be fresh.  Unable to resist, I asked if the fries were fresh (since they didn't look it).  The woman there told me 'yes' and I should have gone with my instinct.    At over $6 it's not bad but not a great deal by any means.  When I tried it I knew I had been had, the fries were definately not fresh.  They were warm but only because the butter chicken had sat on top of it for quite some time as I waited to pay.  Unlike their butter chicken with rice, the first few bites were not pleasant.  The warmness from the butter chicken could not mask the dry and unsavory fries.  Ironically they are right beside NY fries which also has butter chicken poutine available.  Should you find yourself with this dilemma you need to ask yourself what is more important:  Hot fries, or fresh hot butter chicken?  You get fresh fries at NY fries but the butter chicken most likely isn't fresh and hot but if you go with Amaya your fries are most likely going to be sitting there a while before it's served to you.  They get an extra star because I asked the lady if I could get more fries (before I knew they were cold) and she gave me more."}
{"text":"This place has undergone a renovation. Please don't  think that this is the regular fast food express place - it's much more expensive than other Amaya's. I think it's by the same owner across the street who owns Indian Street food. They are working on repositioning this as a sit down restaurant. The food here is nice and well made. The Samosa, Chicken Lollipop  is nice and tasty. They have a Thali that is something worth trying. It has a nice mix of vegetables and rice/nan but a sweet is missing. The place was under renovation when I went in there. I think it can deserve more than 3 stars but that's what I'd like to give it now"}
{"text":"Did I expect really good indian food from this small shop in the Yorkdale food court? not really, but that's exactly what I got. I Ended up stopping in here after seeing someone else with naan and realizing that we also needed some naan. You basically walk in and see all the options right in front of you which is pretty cool (what can I say, I like those mall Chinese food places too). They offer all of the typical choices like chicken masala and beef vindaloo. Today I was intrigued to try what I think was a form of potato curry (Honestly, I don't even know, but it looked and tasted delicious) along with the garlic naan on the side. They have plenty of seating just for them inside there location which is pretty nice. Overall, the potato curry (I think?) and garlic naan were both delicious, and they give you a very large serving which will also serve as my lunch tomorrow. I would definitely come back here on future mall trips!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late, lonely dinner. Opted for the butter chicken bowl with basmati rice. The woman there gave me 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of chicken. In that scoop it contained FOUR small pieces of chicken. It probably wasn't even one breast total. $7.99.   Taste was on par with other butter chicken dishes I've had, nothing spectacular. Rice was decently fragrant and cooked well. Small portions for the bowl meals."}
{"text":"I'd been to an Amaya restaurant so was excited to try this \"express\" version. I've got to say, I was pleasantly surprised! Didn't expect to enjoy the food as much as I did, and I continue to go back here. Nice butter chicken, but my favourite is the chicken madras. A bit spicy but definitely toned down for the average Canadian palate.   Doesn't get much better in a mall food court!"}
{"text":"Spicy noodles, chili chicken, chana. You will pass out if you have this for lunch but at least its tasty."}
{"text":"For a mall restaurant I'd say it's pretty decent.  The choices are good and the menu is fairly easy to understand. I didn't know what some of the things were and the woman serving was nice and explained them to me. I bought the $7.99 special with the butter chicken (it was red) and vegetarian dish. (Was yellow and had yoghurt in it) that was all I could remember about it. I would come here again and try more of the items."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and while I was not blown away I was satisfied.  I found that the dishes were all on the sweet side and lacked developed flavors.  I would order from here because the ingredients seemed like they were of decent quality and the meal was satisfying. Not my top pick."}
{"text":"I came here for their butter chicken.  I had been to the one at Yorkdale and the butter chicken there was good.  The butter chicken here was watery, and the portion is much much smaller than Yorkdale.  If I could give zero star, I would."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my indian food so I may be a harder critic than most.    Food is slightly better than okay.  Delivery was quick but the food was lukewarm when delivered, saag panner was a bright green which I have not seen before in a food dish.    Not bad for the price and they deliver which is a huge plus for Indian food."}
{"text":"- Since this is a fast food place, I will not comment on the customer service because you basically just order and take your order, there is not much serving to discuss about. - What I have tried: Butter chicken which is their most popular one - Quality: The butter chicken sauce was really good but the chicken is very dry. I had it with chickpeas (No extra charges) and it went very well with the food. I also got the yellow rice, which is not much different from white rice.  - Portion: they gave me generous amount of chickens and sauce, but I still think the portion is very small compared to the price - Price: $9.75 + tax came up to  around $11 which is very expensive. I could have just gone to Curry&Co in Dundas 10 food court and get a bigger portion and much better food quality just for $7-8. They even give u a free naan if you're student, but you have to pay $2 something if u want naan at Amaya. - I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"They took an hour and a half to deliver our food, lied about the delivery time and gave senseless excuses. They charge $3.00 to deliver $45.00 worth of food 12 blocks away. The customer service skills of the person answering the phone Friday night is non existent. I would never order from here again. The food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place several times before since I always have strong cravings for Indian food while shopping.  I'm glad they re-introduced the beef vindaloo back on their menu after removing it when people have complained that it was too spicy.   Not for me - the beef vindaloo, costing $11, is the best item on their menu and never disappoints.  I have a moderate tolerance for spice and enjoy it very much.   The beef is tender, sauce is tasty and chickpeas are awesome.  Just make sure you ask for some tap water.  So, if you are like me, this is the dish for you.    I've noticed there is a decline in their quality.  They leave whole bay leaves and indigestible spices (rock solid, pungent and strong) inside the dish.  As an amateur chef, leaving these things inside someone's dish is a big no-no.  I must've swallowed a piece of bay leaf as I felt a mild irritation in my throat like I couldn't breath for 10 seconds.    If you are Amaya Express reading this post, thank you for re-introducing the beef vindaloo on your menu.  But please put your spices in a spice bag!"}
{"text":"If you've never tried Indian food before, than this might be the place for you. The curry dishes I tried (and I tried all of them) were flavourless in comparison to some of the other Indian restaurants in the city. As a matter of fact, I dined at another 2-star restaurant just the night prior to this visit here, and even that was better ten-fold than this place. Save your money, and go to chipotle people."}
{"text":"Finally an Indian fare at a food court!  Yay!  It's great to see something other than Manchu Woks, Made in Japan...etc.  I've always loved Indian food and Amaya Express serves up a pretty great version even in a food court setting.    I ordered their butter chicken bowl with chana masala and a 2 meat combo to go.  Although the chicken was not the usual moist morsels you get at restaurants, the sauce was quiet good.  I also ordered the lamb curry and chicken masala (the 2 meat combo) and they were also flavourful and good.   I would love to see Amaya Express expand into more suburban malls soon."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood Indian take-out where I can get a nice Indian meal to take home.  It is inexpensive and with friendly service.  It irks me that some people seem to take delight in criticism.  I'm with J.J.'s post - I am a regular happy customer.  if you want deluxe cuisine, don't complain about Amaya Express but go to some expensive fancy place instead."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and the staff was not helpful at all. In all honesty, they seemed miserable at their job. I'm not even sure what I ordered, but the portions were small and the rice and curry were watery. Never again!"}
{"text":"You pretty much get what you expect from this place - not the best Indian food you'll ever have but certainly tasty. Tried a couple samosas, lamb vindaloo (combo with rice and naan) and dal makhani and all were good. Called the order in and food was ready within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Spice mixtures were not very typical of the Indian food I know. Service was good but I found it odd that they offered me freshly cooked naan for $1 more or  the alternative of \"cold\" naan which was included in the cost of my meal. The rose lemonade was not very good as well. It's in a large mall, so maybe automatically the bar is lower. Not sure what exactly I was expecting but this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Amaya Express is seriously good. Especially when you consider the fact that it's in a food court!! It's actually better Indian food than I've had in some fancy restaurants.  They have a deal where you can get two meat curries and a veggie one with rice and naan for $13.99. It's a good amount for 2 people to share."}
{"text":"Not sure about how authentic the food is, but it's hella tasty.  Amaya Express (pretty obvious from the name) is part of the Amaya chain of restaurants/eateries.  For a bit I'd be going to the Indian Room, but I discovered Amaya Express just a block or two down the street on Bayview. AE is essentially the same thing as IR, but without all that 'jazz' .... waiter service, romantic ambiance, alcohol.   There's a very small dining area, but it seems that most go for the delivery or take-out options. Check out their website for their menu. On Monday's and Tuesday's, the 'Dinner for 2' is cheaper than other days of the week. You can also buy prepackaged food and sauces.   For Indian take-out, I come here. It's close to home and the food is pretty good.  Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I have gone to Amaya for many years now.  The express locations to me are a big disappointment.  Their flagship restaurant was known for being an upscale place that served some of the best Indian food that I have ever eaten, and with all of the different Indian places that I eat at, that says a lot.  The express locations are budget fast food, and the food is substandard to what I am used to.  The chicken is frequently overcooked, the other dishes are often unrecognizable in taste  but look like Indian food.  They do offer some gluten free options which are good, and I don't have a lot of time and need to eat so they get points for being fast.   The presentation is lacking, and I find the food to be odd tasting.  I hope that at some point they fix it up. Because at one point this restaurant was one of my favourites. Fast food does not have to be substandard."}
{"text":"Rolled in after some serious mall activity - we were totally convinced by the sign that said \"Real Indian Food!\" 1!1!!!!11   This is on the pricey side of Indian Food, but it's the food court and we were really craving some butter chicken. They give out free samples so you can figure out what you want before you buy. The butter chicken was actually very good - spicy, and the chicken was tender. Definitely wasn't feeling the tikka masala - it tasted super weird, almost like sweet and sour sauce or something. We opted for the roti roll, which is basically an Indian burrito - they'll put rice, your choice of curry, lettuce, cucumbers, a bunch of chutneys, and yogurt into a giant roti. They even had one of those Chipotle-esque tortilla heating presses to heat up the roti before they roll it. The first few bites were pretty good but the sauce kind of drips and accumulates into this soggy mess at the bottom and the roti roll got really old, really fast.  They have a pretty good selection of curries for a food court. Their roti was really floppy and kind of weak, and got soggy from the curry really fast. Their naan was very flat too - more like chipati than naan. The staff is super unenthusiastic, but what can you expect?  Overall roti roll came out to around 11.50 after tax, which was fine. You can also get a curry bowl, which is a large serving of curry and rice, for less than $10. Nothing stellar, but would probably come again if I was in the mall."}
{"text":"Only have gotten take out from this place and the food is usually decent here.   Unfortunately prices on the menu have gone up.  This means that you should be expecting even better quality/service, right?? Uhmmmmmm :/  After a few orders here are a few things to comment about:  At least they were honest that the delivery time would be an 1.5 hours and 1 hr 20 minutes.  An order which showed up an extra 15 minutes late came so without any apology for the lateness.  An order of dessert never showed up for one order.   One order of the naan showed up blackened (see photo). Seriously the chef who made this thought it was ok to serve??  Ugh, I want to like this place but this blackened naan at increased prices is the last straw for me.   :("}
{"text":"I love Amaya Indian Room on Bayview so I was very interested in trying their fast food. After trying their fast food, I am definitely a fan. I really like butter chicken so I ordered than with rice which was under $10. The bowl was HUGE and I couldn't finish it. The curry came from a big pot so it was warm when I digged into my food. I'm very interested in trying their naan with butter chicken next time.  Just a tip: you're supposed to bring your tray out to the outside food court after you're done your meal."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Amaya. I've eaten at the Eaton Centre location and it's pretty similar. Nothing exciting to report here but good spot to go if you're vegetarian. If you're vegan, look for the labels; dishes should be marked accordingly.   Ordered the 3-curry thali. Had the aloo gobi, saag paneer and dahl makhni. All three were good except the saag was rather bland.   Can't say much more than that!"}
{"text":"Upon looking at the counter with lots of variety, it was hard to choose one. They all looked so good!  I chose the lime Malasa mutton (I think this was it) on the yellow rice, regular salad with a bright green dressing.  Was not very tasty... I didn't like a single part of the meal. The curry lacked flavour. Very, very mild and didn't taste like an authentic Indian curry at all. The rice was the same. Very plain, but for rice I guess that's okay.  The salad was fresh. I choose the bright green dressing because it was new. I believe it's a type of coconut chutney that usually is served with samosas.  Next time, I would sample the curry beforehand (they offered and have little cups on the side to do so) but honestly don't think id ever come back with other options in the food court."}
{"text":"I had a coupon that I bought a couple months ago and just could not wait to try this place with my friend! We decided to dine in for lunch.   *Glow(positive points):  -Fantastic lunch deal: one appetizer of the day, one meat/poultry dish, one veggie dish, a bowl of rice and one naan bread.   -Quality of food: The appetizer of the day was pakoras. There were six pakoras and they were oh-so-crunchy! They were excellent!  Butter chicken (that my friend ordered) had chunks of chicken and the sauce was thick, just the way it should be!  Aloo Ghobi (veg dish that I ordered) had generous amount of chopped potatoes, cauliflowers and spices.   -warm and friendly staff: when my friend and I were visiting, there was a kind lady serving us food.     *Grow (suggestion points):  -We noticed that there were some dusts on our plates. Since it was just a couple of light dust particles, we just wiped them off with napkins. However, the cutlery was clean. I think the staff should check to make sure that this doesn't happen for future customers.  -The menu is a sheet of paper with names of the dishes. For take-out, looking at the names of the dishes is fine, but for those who dine in, it would be great if there was a menu on a laminated paper/folder- just more enjoyable to look at!"}
{"text":"Probably the worse Chicken Biryani I have ever had. Why don't they just make it like the other places? It's literally the ONLY Biryani that I've had that looked like that. Very disappointing. Sad because they're pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Cold food on the buffet. The meat thali for 14$ is terrible value for what you actually get since the portions are small and the food is not hot. The counter staff is nice but it's understaffed and takes a long time.  I was asked to wait 10 minutes. I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my brother to grab a bite to eat on Boxing Day--needless to say, the food court was a total zoo!  Despite that, we braved the line and got lamb vindaloo bowls with chana masala. The meal itself had some good flavor. It was pretty spicy though, and that's coming from someone who can handle a little bit of spice. Nevertheless, I don't understand the super low ratings, as the food has good flavor and portions were decent."}
{"text":"Food court location that has some seating inside as well. Food is okay. Had the butter chicken which is about $10 and my friend had the chicken tikka masala. To be honest, they both kinda tasted the same.   The first couple of bits were good, but for some reason there was water collecting at the bottom of the bowl. Maybe the rice had too much residual water or the butter chicken sauce broke."}
{"text":"Okay if you want indian food please just go anywhere else but here. This was the worst naan i've ever had. It was sooo stringy and tasted almost fake?? Like it was partially made out of play-doh or something.   I ordered the Mattar Paneer which is my go -to indian dish and there was just an overwhelming amount of peas in it. So much so that there was barely any sauce. It was just peas and cubes of cheese.   The butter chicken we also got was dry and extremely salty.   I don't know if it was just that one bad experience but I definitely won't be ordering from here in the near future."}
{"text":"My husband and I work very specific hours, and we try to plan ahead if we need to order take-out - how long is it going to take, when is it going to arrive between our shifts if I have a night shift. This place has such crazy delivery it's hard to predict. Sometimes it arrives in 20 minutes, sometimes it takes literally over two hours. I know they can get swamped, but they should give a heads up when you call to order.  The food is okay. It's about on par for how much Indian costs, and it tastes okay. The samosas are pretty good, especially the day after, but I guess most Indian food tastes pretty good the next day."}
{"text":"Super pricey, butter chicken had water at the bottom of the bowl. It made my stomach hurt. NOT A FAN AT ALL"}
{"text":"This location sucks ass.  The exact same food is more expensive than other amaya locations, and the service is gross. Everybody seems so pissed off by their customers. I am aware they have a shitty job but that is not my fault.  And the best of all, when I proceed to the cashier, the guy always just put out his hand in front of me without saying a fucking word, meaning he will take my credit card, and tap it on the machine, without me knowing how much I am being charged. Hell, no. So today I just put out my hand, without saying a thing, meaning I want to see the damn machine, the guy looked at me shocked for a sec and threw the machine towards me on the counter. I tapped it, threw it back onto the counter and left with my food. Am I over reacting? I dont think so. They are just so rude and pathetic. I hope this place disappear soon from EC.   This place is not even good enough for a foodcourt."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent quantity, friendly and helpful staff. Will surely eat again if I visit Toronto again"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Indian food. I ordered Amaya through the online delivery service Just-Eat.ca.  It said it'd come in an hour but it arrived in half an hour.   Nice and spicy.   The veggie samosas and their sauce were quite bland.   Garlic naan was pretty good too.   The butter chicken was dried out. The sauce isn't as good as at other Indian restaurants (namely Banjara). There were hardly any pieces of chicken--it was mostly sauce. I felt a bit cheated.  The chicken tikka was tasty and better than the butter chicken. If you order from here, go with this one, over the butter chicken anyhow.  Overall, decent, but I'd suggest ordering from Banjara instead."}
{"text":"The food is not the same quality as the Amaya on Bayview, or the Bread Bar at Yonge and Lawrence, but for a cheaper and take out option, it is pretty good!  My favourite dish by far is the Lamb Rogan Josh and the Beef Vindaloo if you can handle the fiery heat!  The dinner for 2 is a good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"The samosas with chana was good but the chaat tacos I did not enjoy.  If you normally enjoy chaat I wouldn't recommend this.  It's nice having this place in the food court.  For the most part their food seems legit."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is in the mall. It seems like it wouldn't be good for that reason, but this is legit Indian food.  It's even spicier than your average Indian restaurant.  I've eaten here 4 times now and it's amazing every time. I orders buttered naan bread and it wasn't buttered. No big deal. It was still really good. Get the two curry of butter chicken and chicken tikka masala combo and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've honestly always ran away from this little location when I'm scoping for food at Markville Mall.  But yesterday, I was really not into anything the foodcourt had to serve.  Honestly, you can smell the delicious curry just coming down the elevators.  & I decided to give it a shot :D  I got the butter chicken with naan + white basmati rice.  The order came out $11-12.  Since the mall was closing I decided not to be a dbag and went home to eat instead.  The naan and curry was still pretty hot when I opened it up at home.  I loved the naan, it was warm and soft; with that buttery garlic taste that makes you addicted. They gave me lots of huge chunks of chicken and the curry was creamy but a little thin.  Overall, it was a delicious meal and probably my go-to (and the sushi place as well) whenever I'm feeling hungry at the mall.  However, I would not drive out of my way or even on the way to eat here."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken, masala chicken and garlic naan this afternoon for lunch. I love Indian food, but it was very overpriced here especially considering that this particular meal was a bit bland tasting. The rice portion was on the small side, as well as the chicken was drenched in sauce to make it look like a bigger meal. The naan was good. Overall, I love Indian food but this place was okay. I wouldn't mind going back but hopefully next time the meals are more flavourful and bigger."}
{"text":"When I pointed out that they had given me the wrong dish, they tried to force me to take it instead of correcting the order. Incredibly rude service and the manager bizarrely made no attempt to correct his employee's error or try to make it right.   As it turned out, the food is quite poor (even though it looks very tasty) and it is best to avoid this place if you want to avoid a disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst take out I have ever received! Ordered the meal for 2 which comes with a few gravy based dishes, naan, rice and some appetizer. The naan was atrocious! I have had some frozen naans in my life so I can tell when I am being fed one. The naans that Amaya sent us as part of our meals were taken from the back of freezer, quickly warmed up and packed for dinner. So crumbly and really didn't taste good at all. The appetizer chicken was undercooked and everything else was just average. Never ordering again!   See my pictures of how the naans were sent in the dinner. They ended up where they deserved to end up."}
{"text":"This was the first place I checked out when visiting the new food court. While it's not the best Indian food, it's good enough and hits the spot.  The dishes had clearly been sitting for a while so they didn't taste as fresh as they could have, but I still enjoyed my meal. I'd like to try them again a little earlier in the day when maybe the food had just been prepared."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before trying, and the reviews are accurate. Weird, rude, unhelpful workers. Over priced. My naan bread was burnt so I only ate 80% of it.  I got naan instead of rice and I asked it was an extra charge, worker just shrugged their shoulders. Samosas were cold but flavourful. Butter chicken was ok but the chicken was overcooked."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Indian food. My friend and I were craving some so we had to stop by here. They have  a lot of he authentic dishes.  We opted for the vegetable paneer and butter chicken with chick peas over rice. Everything was delicious. You get plenty of cheese in the paneer. Chicken was really moist and tender. The garlic naan was very large in portion wished it came with a sauce to dip in.   There are so many food options in this mall. Food quality and value here is great. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Amaya Express is located inside the new Express Eatery inside Markville Mall.   Love how the staffs able to let your sample the food before ordering. This is definitely a really nice touch.  What I got for a $7.59 meal at Amaya Express though is decent in quality but lack in quantity! Seriously half a bowl of biryani rice with 1 scoop of Butter Chicken is not enough for a meal, unless when I am on a diet.  I think I got spoiled by all the Authentic Indian/Sri Lankan takeout places around the area (Babu is just up the street at 16th Avenue) where I can get double the food at the same price and taste more authentic.  Frequent buyer's card though is a really nice touch!!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, for mall food, this place is amazing. Expensive? yes. Delicious? also yes. I got butter chicken and rice with garlic naan on the side. Keep in mind the naan is extra, which I did not realize. The food was way better than I was expecting. The chicken was so full of flavor. The naan was incredible, of course. The garlic naan was a great idea. I had gotten so much food I was able to take it home for another meal. I was definitely impressed here and would come again."}
{"text":"Every time I come to the food court of Markville Mall, I eat at Amaya Express.  Amaya is not the least expensive, but I find the value fair.  The food tastes authentic enough without being excessively oily.  The biggest draw for me is that it does not taste like food court food; it tastes better.  For a recent visit, the portion of a $6.99 combo was okay for a female.  The guy at the counter kept up-selling me till the last minute.  I declined repeatedly."}
{"text":"Expensive mall food. But well worth the money. Great Chinese as well as Indian food. Naan was fantastic"}
{"text":"It's pretty good when you have a craving. Could add more meat the the servicing. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food court food. We ordered 2 meat curry boxes; butter chicken and one garlic naan on the side. We came up to cash (3 ppl) and the employee only gave us one set of cutlery lol. We ordered 2 dishes and there's 3 people, cmon!   Chicken portions weren't that much. Probably only like 3 max pieces each but they were generous on the rice.  Garlic naan was good. Butter chicken generally is good there."}
{"text":"Gonna give this 4 stars since it was my first visit, but if I get another repeat experience it's going to 5.  Only ordered veggie - but MAN - delicious stuff.  Resonably priced at $40 all in for 2 people take out, WITH left overs in the fridge.  Can't wait to order again."}
{"text":"Used a $15 off $45 coupon, and ordered take-out.  It was o.k. but I'm bothered that the same tomato-based curry seems to have been used for 3 out of 4 curries.    Also, I had been to the Amaya's Bread Bar (3305 Yonge St.), right beside another Amaya Express.  The quality at Amaya Bread Bar restaurant was pretty good.  Not sure why the food from this location was drastically different from the Bread Bar.  I thought they'd be related, since they are both \"Amaya\".  ~~~ What we ordered...  sweet and sour eggplant- good-enough tasting.  spicy chicken curry - I didn't try any of this, but my companion was happy with it.  Good level of heat.  Matar Paneer, Peas with homemade cheese - good-enough, on the savoury side.  Nice, fresh paneer.  This was the only curry that didn't have a tomato base.  (off the menu)  Kale Jackfruit curry - o.k.  spicy.  prob. not my fave.   ~ Next time, I'd rather order from another restaurant, just to find some gem dishes, not generic ones that overuse the same curry sauce."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously near my new digs and they deliver. Actually, maybe it's not so dangerous since they're so close, as I'll be embarrassed to have them deliver since it'd be kind of pathetic of me. Or maybe I'll be OK with it in a pinch? Maybe I'll fake a limp? OK, these things should have stayed in my head.   Ooof. What you really want to know about is the food, not my neurotic relationship with delivery, so here goes...  It's the cleanest and freshest Indian food I've had in Toronto at this price point! Mutter paneer, chicken vindaloo and achar with basmati rice and garlic naan all made it to my door in a timely manner. Their online menu is huge, but they didn't have the paneer I wanted listed but when I asked for mutter instead of saag they didn't even note it not being on the menu. When it comes to delicious Indian, at Amaya if you can dream it they can do it. Yes, it's so good I'm writing in clichés."}
{"text":"Every time I'm at Markville this place always catches my eye. I happened to be craving chaat papri today, and thought I would give this place a chance.   Compared to the chaat papri I've had at Indian restaurants around Markham, this one is definitely tops the list - it was inexpensive, a very good portion size, and tasted authentic. The customer service was also great. It was so good I was reallyyy tempted to purchase another one!   With the other restaurants in the area, I'm always dissapointed with the number of papris they provide, but I was satisfied with the amount provided in the dish, especially at the price point (it's actually larger and less expensive compared to restaurants I've tried in the area). Also, I was given options as to what I wanted to include in the dish, which was great, as at other places you don't really have a choice of what goes in.    Looking forward to trying some of their other dishes in future!"}
