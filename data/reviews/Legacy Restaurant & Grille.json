{"text":"Was there today for a quick bite.  I had the Reuben. Just the right amount of corned beef, sauerkraut, sauce on great bread. Included fries and only $9.  Hard to beat that at a sit down place with quality service.  All staff was friendly.   This is a must try place.  Friday evenings usually have music on the patio between memorial day and labor day."}
{"text":"Just returned from a long trip and we stopped by Legacey. Greeted warmly by to find out later the owner who sat us promptly and introduced our server. Great menu, nice setting and great food. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff but the food was mediocre at best. More or less insipid 1980s catering fare. At the prices charged, that's unacceptable. As an example, the lamb chops were tough and with a \"demi glac√©\" that tasted like canned brown gravy.  The vegetables were what I could make from the supermarket in the microwave. The potato pancakes were tasteless mush with no texture or crispness.  The bread before dinner was too garlicky and otherwise unremarkable.  A disappointment."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday party and had a horrible experience. Our food was awesome but we had an issue with our bill. We asked to speak to a manager, he was the rudest most disrespectful person I've ever dealt with. The managers name is Joe and we will never come back while he is there. Great food but an asshole for a gm."}
