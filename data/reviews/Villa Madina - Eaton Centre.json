{"text":"Getting a salad is the same price as elsewhere but you can only get 2 toppings -- whereas most other places you get 4-6. 
2 vegetables on a plate is not a meal or filling.

 The tabbouli had very little flavor too -- more like just parsley then the refreshing, lemony dish you normally get. 
For the quality of food you get, turns out to be overpriced. 

Don't eat here. There are much better options right next to it."}
{"text":"Really nice food for those who wants a good price for an excellent food! They also have vegetarian option!  Definitely worth the money!!! Baked potatoes are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Average food, but the employees are scam-artists.  It's a hit and miss with this restaurant. If you order to go, you will get scammed. Me and my colleagues decided to order to go one time and when we opened the food up, we knew we had been scammed. it was 80% potatoes and rice, 10% meat and 10% veggies. Very unsatisfying that we had to find something else to eat. I would not recommend eating at the Eaton center Urban eatery branch to any one as there are much better authentic, honest Middle eastern restaurants within the vicinity."}
{"text":"The best shawarma i've had in Toronto.  The meat is superior quality, they put the right amount of meat and sauce, and it's always busy (I.e. Fresh ingredients).  My husband and I go out of our way to walk here."}
{"text":"I have ordered kefta (kinda like meatball) it was one of the worst meatball i ate. I dont consider myself as a picky person. I rarely leave food on the plate but this was really bad i didnt even took a second bite. Then i realise this is the reason they ask to put tahini and hot sauce on the meat since meat itself has no taste at all. Girlfriend ordered chicken, it was relatively better than mine but it was dry. I'll never eat from this place again..."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could.

Today I stopped by to get some food around 6:30. The man whom was preparing my meal was unpleasant and barely gave me $10 worth of food....but that wasn't what set me off. When It came to paying, the cashier looked at me and asked \"What happened to your face?\"...I was in disbelief that this girl had the nerve to ask about my face and all I could say is \"I had surgery\". She just said \"oh ok\".

I had two medical surgical incisions on my face that left scarring, to deal with it is one thing, but to have someone who is supposed to be providing customer service ASK me and POINT OUT my flaw is UNACCEPTABLE. If it was a five year old I'd dismiss it, but this was a grown adult. She didn't ask in a nice way either, she asked in a judgemental insensitive way to HURT my feelings. 

I couldn't even eat my food I was so upset about it.

I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Higher prices, smaller portions, less salad choices than the very excellent 7 King E. location. Staff gets ruder as you go down the line, it's as if they stop caring once you're fully hooked into paying. Didn't offer dressing on salad or the free pita that comes with the plate - one of those 'you snooze you lose' type places.

Last but not least, saw an employee scrape the uneaten portion of his rice back into the rice tray. Fucking Gross."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and sub par food. The men behind the counter mumbles when speaking to you and make it obvious that they don't want to be there (all of them wear a frown). They don't wait for you reply even though they asked and just start filling your plate with stuff you don't want. The food taste the worse compared to all the other villa madinas that I have visited. Not tasty and flavorful at all. They are also so stingy with the garlic sauce. They don't give it to you unless you ask and then it's just a dollop of it in the size of a dime. Won't be coming back to this awful place. The one star is for the girl next to the cash area.  She was nice."}
{"text":"Quite good chicken shawarma. Tabbouleh was light and tasty. Rice fairly good. Hummus was okay, pretty much standard hummus. 

Service was excellent. Very quick and helpful. If I'm in Toronto again, I'll probably return."}
{"text":"Everything's ok, except for the beef 'shavings'. Texture feels a bit artificial and the taste is always inconsistent. I always get the chicken and kefta platter.  Service-wise, the staff here are always efficient so you're sure to get your fill in no time."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I read the reviews about how poor the service was.  My experience was different.  It was just a  few minutes ordering food payment.  However, I felt that the cashier seemed care about customers.

I saw a customer ask her about something in a very demanding way.  However she tried her best to keep calm and quiet, and solved the problem.
Then, when she was about to do my payment. She saw that on the plate there were only vegetables.  She asked me if I wanted only salad.  No, actually I didn't want only salad.  I ordered veggie plate from the menu and thought it came with falafels.  However I wasn't sure why the person who did my order didn't put falafels on my dish.  She walked back there and threw four falafel on my salad.  Yes nice!  Normally I don't eat at a food court and never expect a good customer service at a food court.  I think it's fast food and they aim at fast service rather than excellent service.  It was a little thing for someone but it's a big issue for me.  Give them a try.  They might try to improve their service.  

P.S. The Falafels tasted good as it should be, also the salad :)"}
{"text":"Fast and filling yet subpar food at the Eaton Centre food court. I have not had the service problems that other Yelpers have describes but the service is in my experience a bit brusque.... the Shwarma and other options are kinda meh but very large portions. I found the hot sauce very hot and kinda destined to cover up the mehness of the other flavours. Do yourself and go to Paramount across the street."}
{"text":"I thru up every time I eat from Villa Madina. And I once got a food poisoning from the one that's at 7 King St E"}
{"text":"I usually come to this place when in the Eaton Centre but I was so put off the last time there by their rudeness I will never go back.  I decided to try out the place next door but they had run out of the generic glasses every food establishment in the food court uses (they are not specific to each establishment).  I asked Villa Medina if I could use one of theirs and the tall guy working there was SO rude about it I was shocked!  I told him I was a regular customer but wouldn't eat there again due to his attitude and he literally said \"I don't care, go\".  All over a plastic cup that EACH establishment has the same!!!  They're not even branded!  This was such HORRIBLE customer service I couldn't believe it.  If you don't want to give out a cup for whatever reason, fine but you're still representing your company so don't be rude and belligerent while declining the person.  Completely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and beef platter. Portions for certain things were decent size. Asked for more potatoes than the few that were tossed onto my plate, just got a no from them. They load your plate up with rice but just a sprinkle of salads you choose. And not close to enough meat. 

Food tasted decent but was turned off by the portions and customer service. I hate it when businesses start skimping out on ingredients to save a buck. Lots of better options in the food court. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Generous portions with many choices of sides and salads. I tried the chicken shawarma. It was pretty good but i felt like there was some chicken skin mixed with the meat. Overall pretty good.
Food:4/5
Price: 4/5
Service: NA"}
{"text":"villa medina is consistently the worst shawarma in the city, every location I've been to. Old crusty meat, ridiculously small portions for the price you pay. From now on I'm sticking with the non-franchised shawarma spots in the city."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative rating. The customer service here is awful! They treat their customers like garbage. In all honesty, their food is not that great either. Their poor service extends to all locations. I've seen men working there heckle at females as they walk by. Most of the people working there have accents so when you ask them to repeat what they said, they start yelling at you! I've never encountered poorer customer service. Just awful!"}
{"text":"Had late night soup/noodle bowls here. Good quality food and low price. Well worth going to again but the competition and selection at the food court in Eaton center is top notch."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Staff are rude / display attitude / have poor tone with customers. When paying, the staff member tried to put in an amount directly into the debit machine without ringing it on the register.  When I asked \"how much?\" and looked at the screen to indicate I was waiting for him to properly ring it in (the amount he put into the debit machine was wrong sure enough), he (had glasses on) acted as if I was the problem and then passed me onto another cashier, who I then needed to remind that my order was to go and ask for a bag 3 times before she'd give me one."}
{"text":"Always friendly and answer me questions.  Portions good size and fresh.  Tasty for food court chain.  Shawarma meat sometimes a little fatty - could just be me being particular.

New guy working the counter friendly and earnest.  Cashier ALWAYS super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Guy behind the counter is shilling a deal for $7.99; skewer of chicken and one of beef.  Good deal I say, I request it, get my slop put on the plate and get to the till.  $11.98 or whatever.  What happened to the $7.99 I ask?  Same guy shilling the deal says to the indifferent bitchy cashier, in Arabic, no that was for the kid's plate.  I am Arabic and speak the language and reply, in Arabic, then you should have specified kid's plate.  He shrugged and turned back to the vegetables he was chopping or whatever..  I was ready to say to the girl, enjoy my lunch as I won't be paying for this, but decided I would pay and let potential customers know via Yelp that these folks are con artists and to be VERY careful about what they hear from anyone at any location (same thing at Yorkdale and Eaton Centre).   Same thing happened to my husband, who is not Arabic!  Rude, indifferent, rushed service.  Food is ok, nice change from other fast foods, but it's the blatant lying I can't abide."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty at Madina and the quantity is very generous. However, I found a huge difference between this location and all the other locations. The quantity was reduced and the service was just terrible. The employees are blatantly rude every time I go. They start putting things in your plate before asking if you want it (it's set up like a food bar and you have options for your sides), or they'll ask after they've already put it (i.e., \"what salad do you want?\" *puts random salad in plate before I can answer* \"this salad?\" i guess so, you've already put it on my damn plate!). They do that with everyone. They're so stingy with the quantity too. The food is pretty good but those employees need to learn patience and manners!"}
{"text":"In the Eaton Centre food court and visited during lunch. Have to say they give you pretty big portion sizes. Food is halal which is a plus. Ordered the Shish Tawook with chickpea salad, regular salad, potatoes and rice. The food was cold and potatoes and rice tasted pretty stale. Wasn't too happy especially spending $12 with taxes. Would have been nice to have the food served warm and potatoes not tasting days old. The chickpea salad was refreshing but everything else was meh! I wouldn't completely write this place off. I would go back another time but making sure to voice my complaints about my previous order so they don't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"Horrible food I should have read the reviews before I ordered. Falafels weren't cooked chicken kabob was dry coleslaw had an awful taste just horrible. Villa Madina Yorkdale is 100% better than Eaton Centre"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time - all my coworkers come back from here with huge take-out containers filled with heavenly smelling food. 

I wasn't feeling like being very \"good\" for lunch, so a chicken shwarma platter was going to do the trick. They're pretty efficient here at getting through a line, something that's a key consideration when getting food between the hours of 11:30-4 and 5:30-7:30. They gave me rice and potatoes first, then my choice of two salads and then sauces and finally meat. 

First off, there were multiple kinds of rice and I would have liked to choose what kind I wanted. In the end, the kind I got, I didn't like - it had cinnamon in it or something and when I have a savory meal, i want savory sides. The potatoes were quite good, roasted and not too big (I hate when you get one massive hunk of potato). As for salads... well that section is more than a little daunting. They must have at least 10 different kinds of salad, multiple kinds of green salad, pasta salad, chickpea salad, and a bunch of others I didn't even see. I felt rushed so I ended up with standard salad and chickpea salad, but they should probably put up signs that say what everything is. Add some garlic sauce (very thick and white - and not terribly flavorful) and hummus, throw the meat on top and you're all done. I added tahini and the hot sauce (not hot at all, great flavor tho) and with a drink, the entire thing cost me about $12.50. 

All in, not the very best shwarma I've ever had, not even close and it was a tad expensive for me... usually I can get a full takeout container of similar stuff for less than $10 including drink. But on a rainy day where I want shwarma and can't be bothered to walk a few blocks to get some of the best in the city, this place will do. The sauces lacked some flavor and the rice was awful. But the chicken was incredible and the \"hot\" sauce was pretty good too. Avoid the garlic sauce and go for extra hummus instead."}
