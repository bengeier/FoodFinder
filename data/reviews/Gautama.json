{"text":"I've been taking all my guests from out of town to this restaurant as its worth the price for the quality of food. Friendly staff always there to provide good service. Buffet items always there and fresh. Wish they changed the options time to time as the same choices can get boring. Clean restaurant. 


Give this place a try if you're craving Indian food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Indian Buffet on Gerrard Street. The food is really good and tasty ! However, the restaurant can be a bit cramped so not recommended for really big groups. It's also a bit pricey compared to other Indian buffets but occasionally it's worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Had buffet... it was below averager to average.

Food luke warm

No taste or spice or meat"}
{"text":"food - Everything was tasty. The meat was good quality and sauces created a beautiful mesh of flavors with the raita and chutney

service - very helpful and courteous

atmosphere - nice clean place. waiters are clean cut and well dressed, table cloths and silver wear, bathrooms are impeccable (this is quite a change from other places on this street). There is a terrace for summer months too. 

price - very competitive week end lunch/brunch buffet ($10.99) that includes appetizer items, mains and deserts"}
{"text":"Great buffet, great price!
The staff is very friendly. The food is delicious but nothing different from what is offered at other buffets in the area. On the other hand, the decor is nice, more modern than the other places in Little India."}
{"text":"Gautama. A short film.

Saturday night. Little India. 8pm.

Scene opens with a panning shot of the bustling street, Duvali lights sparkling, shoppers rushing past with large bags of groceries, clothing stores shine with beautiful sari's in the window.

Camera stops at a huge line outside a restaurant. Siddhartha. Frustrated, hungry Torontoians queue up for tasty Indian buffet. They are told it will be about 35 minutes. 

Camera pulls out an pans about a block to the west to another Indian restaurant, Gautama. Camera zooms in on the sign, when viewers notice the exact same logo next to the restaurant's name as seen on Siddhartha.

Camera pulls back, then zooms in once again , this time into the large front window to reveal a half empty room.

Fade out.

guatama is the new little sister resto to Siddhartha. Same exact logo, same exact menu, no line-ups or waits for take-out. Way better service.

Yet no one knows this.  People were literally lined up the door at Siddhartha, yet Guatama sat only 45% full

We called in an order, here is what we had:

Chicken Tikka Malsala ($10.99): super creamy and spicy boneless marinated chicken

Lamb Vindaloo ($10.99): super tender lamb stewed in a spicy red gravy

Saag Paneer ($9.99): creamy spinach with a bit of heat and cubed housemade cheese

We ordered a couple more dishes but I can't seem to remember their names. One was a stewed chickpea dish, the other was a curry with sauaage-shaped balls made with chickpeas and nuts.

We ordered everything medium spiced, it was spicy but not unbearable at all. Everything was super fresh and delicious.

Will definitely go back, my new favourite place in Little India!"}
{"text":"Having newly moved in the neighbourhood, I was excited to try the Indian cuisine within walking distance. Went here last night to try the dinner buffet with one of my girlfriends. The food was very good, although I would've liked a few more options in the hot buffet but for $13 it was well worth it. I also tried the Mango Lassi which was a perfect pairing with the food. Interior was very nice and wait staff were attentive/friendly. 4/5 stars :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place to visit . The customer service was awful.. They do not have decency to talk to customers and answers questions .. We were visiting Toronto on a family trip and happen to go to this restaurant for dinner.. I ordered a beer (King fisher) and the server said they were out of it .. After 5 mins I saw him taking the same beer for different customers .. I asked him about it .. He didn't bother to answer but when I pestered him .. He said that's the last ones he had .. I was pissed, I didn't order food  but kids ended up eating since they were hungry. It wasn't great .."}
{"text":"Had a curry craving while visiting Toronto, so we had to go. Their buffet is on point. I don't usually go for a buffet, but I had a look at it before I ordered and I was impressed with what I saw. Everything looked fresh, and it was. Very, very tasty. Moist, saucy, heat, good stuff. Nice, classy atmosphere, great mood lighting. Service was very friendly. They even brought out fresh Naan upon request - a piping hot stack. I ate more than my fair share.

The cab driver recommended this area since it is known for Indian. I'm glad we listened to him!

By the time we left, I hurt (this is a rare occurrence, it was that good!)

Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Where do I start... This place is the best! Randomly walked in for takeout and the servers quickly handed us a menu and let us sit on the patio. They had suggestions which was really helpful. The restaurant itself is also one of the cleanest amongst the Gerrard India Bazaar. While we waited, the servers brought us ice water and then Pakoras!!! Say what!!! A complimentary appetizer while we waited for take out... Talk about impeccable service! They were absolutely delicious- the rest of the food too. So flavourful and the spice wasn't over powering! God damn!!!!"}
{"text":"Really yummy buffet. Went here for dinner with the boyfriend. Restaurant was surprisingly nice: wood floors, nice mirrors,  fancy wood panelled bar. We agreed it was  overly nice for a buffet. food was delicious with the perfect amount of spice. Heineken and Coronas were only $5. We'd definitely come back. Great value."}
{"text":"This makes NO sense! So, the SO and I went to Little India for buffet. We were planning on going to Recency, but saw a sandwich board outside of Gautama and thought we would give it a try. We have had takeout from here before and it was really good. Spicy, flavourful and so on. The same dishes on the buffet? Bland, soupy, flavourless and extremely SWEET. So bizarre. I can only assume that they are trying to cater to a \"western palate.\" And they must be doing something right, the place was rammed. 

Really, not great. Everything tastes the same. No spice, heavy sugar. Get takeout or nothing ."}
{"text":"Not a fan of buffets so we elected to order off the menu. We were asked and encouraged to eat from the buffet at least four times before we ordered. 
We had the chicken korma, paneer makhni(sp?) garlic naan rice and a mango lassi. Everything was seriously dope! The naan was totally off the chain with the paneer dish and the korma was creamy and amazing. 
Highly recommend this place, I will come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were lucky to have Indian friends who recommended meeting up here for dinner on a Friday night.  We were able to enjoy the buffet where they served a variety of chicken dishes and goat curry.  Their goat curry was absolutely wonderful with large pieces of goat with the bone in that was cooked long enough that the marrow was dripping out of the bone and the meat was a mixture of fatty and lean.  The curries were all very tasty including chana masala and their saag paneer had a uniquely sweeter taste than most that we've had, but pleasant at the same time.  Overall, we enjoyed a great dinner with great company.  The wait service was great as well as our glasses were always more than half full and our dishes were cleared timely."}
{"text":"Consistent buffet. Staff are efficient. Veggie and meat options korma, butter chicken, daal, aloo gobi etc. You choose. A cold buffet with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. 

The first time we decided to fill up a styrofoam container from the buffet and take it home to eat. We packed a number of dishes -- bhaigan aloo (eggplant and potatoes), saag paneer (spinach and cheese), naan, channa masala (spiced chick peas), daal, rice and pakoras. All were tasty, each dish had its own distinct flavour and none were too oily. We were excited to go back again. 

Good thing I didn't write my Yelp review then because I went back today for their lunch buffet and I was very disappointed. 

We arrived at lunch time (noon) and the buffet food was lukewarm! I would have expected piping hot fresh food at noon! The saag paneer and some veggie korma-type dish were so sweet all you could taste was sugar. The eggplant was passable. There was no channel masala in the buffet offering despite there being a label for it. The daal was bland. Ultimately, every dish from the buffet was muted in flavour or was sweet. We ordered a few poori (fried bread) from the menu and they were oily and floppy, not light and crispy.  

The chocolate ice cream and the plain sweet lassi were my only two enjoyments.  

What happened Gautama? This is NOT what authentic Indian food tastes like. This is Indian food for non-Indians."}
{"text":"I have eaten at more Indian buffets than I can remember but without a doubt, the food at Gautama is the very tastiest. 
They have the usual amount of different items on the table, but here you will find they all have their own unique flavours, and each dish is made with care.
The staff is terrific; they ran out of Tandoori chicken and when the next batch was ready they brought it around the restaurant and served each table directly before putting the balance back into the buffet table.
You cant beat this restaurant for a delicious buffet. Only $1.00 more per person than every other buffet in the area, but a world of difference in taste."}
{"text":"Another in the Siddhartha empire developing on Gerrard.  (I was told that there will be another opening nearby, completely vegetarian.)

The space is open and airy with nice, new decor.  The buffet is 2/3 vegetarian, had the usual dishes including dal, naan and papadom.  (At one point, someone came out of the kitchen with a basket of hot naan, and delivered it to each table as needed.)  They had the standard desserts, including Gulab Jamun and low-quality ice cream (banana, chocolate, mango and vanilla).

The food was good, not outstanding.  There's nothing really to set it apart from many other Indian restaurants in Toronto.  The gentleman who seems like he may be the manager told us that the food is meant to be \"spicier\" than at Siddhartha.  We didn't notice.

It's a nice space, has a good selection on the buffet, and presents an enjoyable dining experience.  Check it out."}
{"text":"The buffet is decent with a good selection.  This restaurant has a higher price point than other buffet restaurants in Little India with similar and equally good or better buffets. I think at Guatama you are paying a little extra for the atmosphere, which is quite lovely compared to others."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants to go to. Food is good and staff is very friendly. We've been to many Indian places and we always end up saying Gautama is way better."}
{"text":"Horrible food. If you're looking for authenticate Indian food, this is NOT the place for it. Curries were super sweet, the desert was not... Naan was stale... Overall a poor experience. 

Will not repeat this place!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  The buffet was good, with all the food hot and fresh.  Green P parking right behind the building helps too."}
{"text":"We popped into Gautama this afternoon to get out the rain and decided to stay and try the buffet. Butter chicken and Chana were ok but the curries were quite thin and bland. Also I found the service a little bit rude. 

It was the Festival of South Asia today and we walked pass so many tasty lunch options on the street. I kind of wish we had of grabbed something else before it started pouring and we ran in here. 

The bottle of Kingfisher I had hit the spot as it was about a million degrees in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the lunch buffet ($12.99) and Gautama fit the bill. A-OK Indian buffet with a decent selection. If something didn't turn your crank there was something else to have. Naan was fresh from the kitchen but quickly snapped up and there was a wait for more which didn't materialize. Rice and tandoori chicken was decent and basic. The cold side of the buffet, opposite the longer steam area had some nice cole slaw and super sweet sticky chutney that tasted nice and gooey good. 
The view from the room is outstanding with big expansive windows looking out a corner lot facing south west. Lining the length of the room outside is a partly covered patio for warm weather. If you squint you could be seated in a US Midwest eatery with the darkish decor.
Decent enough alternative to when Famous re-opens (soon). Free off street parking is nearby."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was really yummy. Great selection. Mishkal, our waiter, was extremely friendly and made our time there that much better. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to Gautama a couple months ago with the gal pals for a catch up. It's so hard to choose a place in Little India when there are so many delicious smells wafting at you from any number of places. But Gautama impressed us and i've been back several times with my SO. 
Firstly, the price is right. We go for the dinner buffet and it's $14 each if I remember correctly. 
Also, the service is always wonderful. It's a serve-yourself buffet, which leaves the wait staff available to be very attentive for drink orders. My water glass is never less than half full and they take away your dirty plates as soon as you get up for your next course.
The food is delicious! With a vegetarian best friend, and an boyfriend who doesn't eat pork, this is the perfect place to go and have everyone be happy! Most of the dishes are vegetables (chick peas, veggie samosas, saag paneer, veggie pakoras, potato and cauliflower etc.), and the meat ones are mostly chicken (butter, curry and tandoori), as well as the one curry goat option. I love the papadum but it's kind of hidden. You'll find it in a serving dish on top of the cold food options and fruit. 
Don't forget to have the honey ball or ice cream for dessert! 
They also have a great side patio in the warmer months."}
{"text":"This buffet is worth a visit!

Over the past few years, I've given up on Indian buffets. The food is never spicy enough, buffets are dirty and food items aren't replaced in a timely fashion, and when you scoop up any paneer dish there are usually three little cubes swimming in a pool of sauce. Disappointment has become a familiar sentiment.

Gautama was a risk that I'm happy I took. All of the items on their buffet were very good. In addition to white basmati, they had a Pulau rice dish, wonderful paneer, and each sauce was flavourful and rich. Food was replenished often and the general food quality was far above average. The naan on the buffet was EXCELLENT, which is a rarity!

Wine was super cheap. But they did not have two of the wines that were advertised on the menu (unfortunately both were the best pairings for Indian food), Our server had no idea how to open a bottle of wine, but was polite and tried his best.

The set up of the buffet was a little hectic and several times I found myself accosted by fellow diners because the plates are in the middle of two buffets, one hot one cold, so there's no real rhyme or reason as to where the line begins. If they had enough space, this would work, but it's a little cramped. I'd recommend the they begin with plates first, cold buffet, followed by hot.  Everyone there seemed a bit annoyed.

We made sure to tell our server how impressed we were with all of the food. He was genuinely flattered and offered us some Kashmiri Tea. Unfortunately the tea took forever and we needed to leave. We had a quick sip, but it was very hot and we didn't have a time to wait for it to cool down.

Despite being a pale white girl, I am a person who eats a lot of Indian food and cooks it at home often, I was very pleased with this buffet dinner and wold recommend it to anyone looking for a surprisingly excellent buffet in Little India."}
{"text":"We love everything about Guatama: the food, location, staff, ambience, prices and servers. Even the views looking out from the restaurant are great. The buffet is always reliable and delicious, and what they don't have they are happy to replace promptly. We have taken visitors there for dinner many times, and they have come away with the same impressions we have. We live in Little Indian, and this is our favourite local restaurant."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food good, which surprised me because it's a buffet. I'm no expert on indian food, but I've tried enough indian places to know that I won't be disappointed on my visits. They have outdoor seating, which is also nice.

My biggest problem is that my inner fatty takes over and I ALWAYS OVEReat!"}
{"text":"Amazing! 

The food is great for the price and the servers are always available to take away your dirty plate or refill your water."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, have eaten there  over 15 times
Waiters give pleasant table service 
nice selection at buffet , priced similar range as most other restaurants in area"}
{"text":"The place is nice and cozy, quiet too! For dinner the price for an adult was $15.99 before tax! There were at least 4 chicken options on the menu, plain rice, chicken briyani and naan. There were also 4 vegetarian options such as channa masala, paneer and okra. The staff were very attentive and polite, our water was filled every time we got up to go to the buffet, and the dirty dishes were picked up immediately. The only issue I had was I thought the food was missing flavour, the tandoori chicken was exceptional, however I felt as if the chicken masala, butter chicken and channa masala all tasted the same. This is why the restaurant isn't getting 5 stars... I really missed the flavour that I would get at an a la carte restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Service was horrendous, unless you're white. In that case, they'll at least acknowledge you. Otherwise, you're lucky if they even look at you. Shamefully rude service. There are much better places for desis to take their business and get half decent service. For a table of eight people, you'd expect at least a smile....we will never go back nor would we recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I've had the buffet in many of the Indian restaurants in Little India and this is definitely my favourite. LOVE the food here! My husband and I have eaten here many times on our own or brought friends and family and it's always been a great experience. The food is always fresh, hot and well stocked -- they check regularly and refill often. There are lots of options to choose from -- whether you're vegetarian or not, there are so many flavourful options. I love the fact that they rotate menu items so each time I've been here, there are the welcome staples but then there's always something new that I haven't tried before. I love their Paneer Makhani -- it's the best I've ever tasted. The sauce is sooo delicious! The service is always quick and friendly. There's occasionally a wait for a table on the weekend but the turnover is quick and it's worth the wait. This is also one of the few restaurants in Little India that has outdoor seating which is a nice option in the summer so you can eat and people watch at the same time. Just go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, ambience is good but the staff and food is worse. We ordered some food and a mango lassi,  totalled upto some $87 which already had an additional surcharge.

So here is where they are bad: The mango lassi was just mango puree with water, when I said that this doesn't taste like make lassi, just after a sip as there was no yogurt in it and it was very thin in consistency I was given a lecture n argument that this how its been made for 16 years. So I told them to please take it back as I dont like it n they did (looking at me in rage). Then they brought us the food, which first of all is like not worth the money coz there is no justifiable quality or quantity. Plus to take revenge the staff added so much red chilli powder on top that we had stomach burns right from the very first bite, so requested them to change it n they said it will still be charged n to taunt us one of thier other servers kept commenting I hope you are enjoying the food (when u can taste the difference that whether the food is cooked with or has chilli powder added just on top) 

Its not at all good for Indian people as you would straight away know how they are fooling people.

Will never go back there even if I was given free food."}
{"text":"been here a few times usually when my friends and I are really hungry and craving Indian food. this is a buffet for $13.99? in my opinion food is fine, never experienced any terrible service or anything, selection isnt huge or anything but has everything that I like to eat along with a veggie area, fruits, ice cream."}
{"text":"Excellent food & very friendly service!  Very nice atmosphere as well.  If we were locals, we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of Siddhartha Vegetarian Indian Buffet for 3 years, since I moved away from Toronto, only to return to find it has changed hands and no longer exists?!!

Apparently Gautama is the new sister to Siddhartha. We stumbled upon it, as I recognised the logo on the sandwich board. 

The decor is modern, but has less character than before. The buffet was not ready when we got there. It took a while for the server to approach us as well. 

The buffet was tasty, although saucier than I remember. You were lucky to get a piece of meat or cheese. The lamb curry was quite gristly. The veggie dishes (potatoes in particular) were cold, and undercooked. 

However, the chicken curry was divine. The tandoori chicken was also delish. The naan was hot and crispy and fresh. 

I would try it again, if I was in the area. I wouldn't make a special trip..."}
{"text":"Always my go to all you can eat Indian buffet place on Gerrard East.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly,  and the spices are not too over whelming, as some places simply overkill on the spices.  There's a lot of variety on the buffet,  and it's always being restocked with fresh food.  The waiter will even come around with fresh Naan or tandoori chicken and give it to you at your table.  

I wished they had a mango salad on there,  as their cold buffet is lacking. The iceberg lettuce was looking a little sad, but they had a good selection of desserts."}
{"text":"Very attentive service by our waiter and checked up on us constantly to fill out water, checked if everything was good, and gave us freshly made naan. Food wise I can't handle spicy foods well, so I wouldn't be able to vouch for the authenticity of it, but I enjoyed it. The number of items for the buffet were on the lower side but it's still a great deal for dinner at $14.99 per person. The whole buffet area as well as the dining area was clean. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"When there last night and had a great experience.It was busy and the food was fresh, They even brought fresh tandoori chicken and naan bread to the table."}
{"text":"Well the hubby and I checked out this place for their brunch buffet on the weekend. I have to say that it was really just OK. It had all the usual suspects, butter chicken and some other kind of curry -- it had daal and it did have salads and some things for after including ice cream.

I just have been to other Indian buffet's that were far better than this. The butter chicken was just ok. The sauce was kind of thin not that really wonderful rich kind  of sauce that you expect from butter chicken. 

Service was nice and regular, we enjoyed with Mango Lassis which were good. 
Btw I think this might be a reboot of Siddhartha. I was never a big fan of them either. 

Prices on their website don't match what you get charged."}
{"text":"Nice food, Excellent Service only clean place on Gerrard st hats off will go back at a 100%"}
{"text":"We were enjoying the street vendors at the South Asian Festival today when suddenly the skies opened up and we were in a monsoon.  Lahore was just too far in the insane rain, so we we sought refuge from the downpour in Gautama.  

I am really really sorry we did.

First disappointment...a buffet.  Never my choice of dining experiences, but we didn't notice that until we'd already been seated.  Oh well; could be worse. And it was.

Second disappointment...the buffet.  Could it be any smaller?  Where is this nice selection?

Third disappointment...the food from the buffet.  As the rain water flooded the streets outside, the chicken dishes too were floating in an ocean of sauce.  The rice had frozen veggies in it - the same kind my parents use in the food they make for their dogs.  The dal, normally one of my favourites, was absolutely flavorless and the palak paneer, well let's just say I saw absolutely no evidence of paneer. But I did find lots of gristle in my chicken. Obviously, I did not go back for seconds.

The fourth and final disappointment...the service.  The server asked if we wanted another round of Kingfishers.  We said no.  He proceeded to bring two more when we were at the buffet.  We called him over and we reminded him that we said no.  He rolled his eyes, but took them away. 

We waited for an eternity after asking for the bill.  Our original server came over and said \"Why are you still sitting here? Do you want the cheque?\"  Rude and duh...yes.  When the bill came, naturally we were charged for the two Kingfishers we sent back.  When we pointed out this error to him, he began arguing with us that we ordered them and it was our fault.  

I will NEVER EVER come back here!"}
{"text":"We had intentions of eating at Siddhartha's but when we drove by, the restaurant was dark with a sign saying it was closed for renovations and to go to Gautama instead.

Arriving around 7-ish on a Friday night, Gautama was pretty full.  We were able to snag the last table for 5 right in the window.  

Famished from a long work day, we hit up the buffet ($13.99) and loaded up.  While I was spooning food onto my plate, I noticed that the different curries were quite runny and thin, including the butter chicken and daal.  

The mattar and saag paneers contained very little cubes of cheese.  Naan was available for a very short time in the buffet, and not delivered fresh to each table as we had experienced in the past at Siddhartha's. Once the naan was quickly snatched up, it took a while to replenish.  I was actually only able to get one quarter piece for my whole meal and was finished eating by the time new naan came out.

I found the buffet food to be lukewarm in temperature and totally agree with a previous reviewer that the butter chicken was very, very sweet tasting, and the watered down sauce wasn't appetizing.

Finished off our meal with a bit of fresh fruit, freezer burnt ice cream and decent Gulab Jamun.

Service was friendly and efficient for a busy place.

I've definitely had better buffet food in Little India before.  It was disappointing that the the food at Gautama was so watered down and sloppy."}
{"text":"I would not recommend buffet. The food seemed to have artificial flavours. Butter chicken was toooo sweet.."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet this past tuesday night. We searched reviews for indian food on Gerrard East and could not find a great review for a restaurant setting (not fast food), non vegetarian (hello butter chicken!), non greasy, and nice ambiance indian food resto.
So we just went there and walked around. We found that this one was the only one that was not empty (we were there around 730pm) and appeared new-ish. 

So the stars are for :
fairly new looking
cleanliness of the resto/ decor and layout (really can make a difference - quite a few other places looked so cheap and dirty)
size of the resto
****great customer service!!! (apparently hard to come by lately) attentiveness of the host/waiter (yes he did come around with freshly made hot garlic naan and served us at our table - this was buffet so it was a nice touch! and kept filling up our water glasses and always took away our dirty dishes and was very aware when you needed to catch his attention for the bill etc).
the selection was alright
the naan was delicious
even though it was \"standard\" icecream ..... I loooooooved the mango icecream - usually I dislike that - especially at chinese resturants (usually get the green tea instead) but this mango tasted like passionfruit!!I wanted to take the tub home! (sadly this made up for most of my disappointment in the butter chicken.. its sad cause this is an indian resto and here I am raving about the icecream!)

the lack of stars:
im sorry but butter chicken shouldnt taste so sweet!! (can we say - ketchup?) :-( This is actually the second resto that served sweet butter chicken... maybe Im missing something here and maybe there are different kinds of butter chicken? 
This was such a let down cause that is my staple for assessing the indian food. I usually love butter chicken! The chicken masala made up for it. Though at one point, I think the chicken was undercooked.


So this resto has potential - the look, the friendliness, but they gotta work on the quality of the food. Hopefully someone will tell them or they will read the reviews. Once they get that the place will be great - considering the surrounding dives."}
