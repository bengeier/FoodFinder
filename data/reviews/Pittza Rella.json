{"text":"Just moved to the area and tried it for the first time. Not bad, better than a lot of other pizza places around Pittsburgh. The wings were pretty good too. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I haven't had Pittza Rella in about a year and randomly a few days ago my brain and stomach was craving their unique out of this world delicious steak rolls and pepperoni rolls.  When they came, they were even better than I remember them being.  This place puts a lot of love into the rolls.  Rather than separate round rolls they come in a long roll that's cut into slices.  The steak comes with peppers onions and mushroom and cheese.  The outside is crispy and perfectly browned and the same goes for the pepperoni rolls.  If you are a classic Pittsburgher you'll want some ranch dressing to dip them in so be sure to ask for it cause it doesn't come with it.    We also ordered pizza which I never had before and even that impressed me.  The cheese and toppings and everything stayed in its place bite after bite.  The crust was light and crispy, not too cooked not undercooked, just right.  If you are in the West Mifflin/Homestead/Munhall area and you want to try an alternative just as good as Pizza Company with its own flare, Pittza Rella is a great game day decision."}
{"text":"Pittza Rella rocks! This is our go-to place.   Pizza is excellent. Cheesy, not too saucy (my gf prefers extra sauce, but I think it's awesome as is), toppings are appropriately generous. The crust is halfway between fluffy and thin...with cornmeal. I usually eat the crust, which is an indicator that it's delish. :-) My faves are the Cheeser Pleaser (much cheez!!) and Spinach Feta.   The fries are AMAAAAAAZEBALLS. Batter dipped and delicioso. The cheesy bacon fries will make you not even care that you just consumed 300,000 calories (estimate).  Hoagies are good, nuthin fancy. But toasted and delish. Oh, except the steak....it's steak-umms or whatever, and not chopped up. Who doesn't at least chop up the steak in a cheesesteak?  The salads are ok...classic Pittsburgh with mostly iceberg and tons of fries and cheese. Definitely not my pick from the menu, but it's a pizza place, not a bistro in shadyside.   The pasta is also good, but be prepared for a f-ton of cheese if you order the 4 cheese alfredo. You won't poop for a week.  The shop itself is a teeny thing, so they are mostly geared for delivery. I *think* they have a couple seats, but I'm guessing they are really for folks to sit when waiting for food. Never had a problem with delivery, but I am certain they know where we live by now!   Prices are alright, maybe a little high, but the food is good, so I don't care. We usually drop 30-40 (including tip) for 2 people, but we always order enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place after the huge deal a person made about this place. So I ordered a pizza roll which was brunt and cold. I should of just saved my money and made my own. Which would of been much better. Don't believe all the hype Yelp reviews make. Because sometimes there wrong."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch recently after having to do a site visit for work.  As you might imagine, pizza is their specialty but I didn't notice whether or not they have pizza slices.  They've got an individual build your own pizza though.  They've also got your typical hoagies, gyros, salads, & pastas too.  My ham and cheese hoagie was pretty good and I'm glad they have half hoagies here too."}
{"text":"We stopped by while in the area for a quick dinner. We ordered a chicken rancher hoagie, which is grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion & ranch dressing. We also ordered broccoli puffs. The puffs were really good. They did not taste as if they were frozen, although I'm sure they were. They weren't bad though.  The hoagie was delicious. We were full enough after splitting everything.  The shop was small but did its job. There were tables. The menu was large and had good options. I cannot comment on the pizza but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Pittzarella is a solid yinzer Italian joint. I've really only had one thing here, but it's solid and I get it regularly.   Some people call them hoagies, others Italians, few call them subs around here, but either way it's what I get.   Three reasons why their Italians are good:  1) they're very long, larger than 1 ft ('nuff said) 2) they have legit capicola on them 3) they're toasted and the meat gets a little crispy along the edges  If I ever get to try more menu items and they are as solid as their Italians they could easily be upgraded."}
