{"text":"The low review is due to the customer service of this establishment. The food is a 4-5, but the lack of respect for customers, at least on my visit of September 1, 2016 is a 1 at best. They have a jukebox that can be played from a smart phone and when the jukebox is not playing music is still played. Since it was the Cleveland Brown's final preseason game, thought we would eat out and watch the game. Sadly I tried to play some pre-game music on the jukebox, but the volume was much lower than the radio. Upon asking the server if it could be turned up, the response of the manager at the time is it is already loud enough. When I asked if the songs could be skipped so music could be played, she indicated she had a full bar and could not do it. But she went further, and included our discussion to everyone at her full bar. The song playing went for 20+ minutes, she could not find the time to hit the eject button, but found the time to run her mouth to everyone sitting at the bar. I had a few guys ask me how much I paid so they could refund me the money from their own pockets. It wasn't about the money....it was about tailgating.....And while one might think this is a personal conflict with me and her, I never meet her and don't even know her name. But if that is the person managing the place, I would suggest you don't play the jukebox or voice any concern you may have about your experience - they will tell the whole bar and not address your concern. I piad for my meals and drinks and left about 20 minutes later, just about the time the non-jukebox music came back on. While she could not find anytime to skip the song, she was still running her mouth about my concern to customers as I left. Again food is 4-5 as I have in the past been a customer a few times a month,  but the current in charge my way manager will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Best damn meat loaf I've ever had no frills that's for sure but great, consistent food"}
{"text":"The food is good and affordable...Unfortunately the bartender was extremely intoxicated last time we were there...so much that she just helped herself to our food..she was disgustingly drunk..not happy at all..really unfortunate situation..many times that we have gone there the bartenders were drunk but this last time was over the top..terrible.terrible..terrible..owners certainly don't seem to mind...I have spoken to quite a few people about how trashed the bartender was..quite a few people said that is why they quit going there....would not suggest the place to anyone...horrific service"}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch.  Food is always great and the service is attentive.  You can really tell the difference between the servers at a place like this and the apathetic kids that staff the chains like Quaker Steak and Lube, TGIF and the like.  My favorite is the Gyro salad and the fish fry on Fridays.  If I had a small grumble, the $10 price for Gyro Salad is a bit on the steep side for what is essentially bar food-but the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Have been to CT many times with coworkers for lunch.  Food is ALWAYS very good, atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly.  Try their Greek Burger, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Great place and great staff. Truly. Amazing food and atmosphere. Amazing hours (6am to 2am) and the food is all homemade. The owner is literally the chef. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm being very generous giving 3 stars .. I had the quesadilla which is pretty basic anywhere you go. It had some sauce on it I wasn't too crazy about and I think it would be better without. It was my first time eating there so I didn't know. But I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt because my friends regularly eat here. I'm told their meatballs are delicious! I'll give it another shot.."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's been many things over the years from bars to poorly run Italian restaurants to a \"Redneck Rendezvous and Bar-b-que...\" While the Calla Club will always be near and dear to my heart, the Towpath is right up there with it.   The ownership is amazing, food is great, and the customers are always fun. The one thing that suffers are the servers and some bartenders. Some of them make me a bit nervous that they are too drunk to be working or possibly on some other substance. I understand that it can get a bit crazy sometimes when you work in bars, but when your own coworkers complain about you to customers, you know something is wrong.  Outside of the fun and crazy nights, it's still family friendly during the earlier hours of the evening, especially on Fish Fry Fridays during Lent!   I certainly love it here so not much would keep me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food choices and good draft beer as well as a nice homely atmosphere. This place is a gem compared to many other Bar and Grills in the area. The food is by far above the rest. Get the meatball appetizer. It's a great MEAL for the value."}
{"text":"Didn't even try the food because the owner was so incredibly rude we got up and left. No wonder it was nearly empty on a Sunday. Stay away."}
{"text":"our waitress was a bit of a bubblehead + I expected a more interesting drink menu meaning mixed drinks for the summer at a bar .. but the burgers were delicious .. fries quite tasty as well .. we did not notice the \"specials\" board until we were walking out & only because we heard the other waitress offering to tell other patrons about it .. our waitress seemed confused on what day it was so needless to say she did not make that same offer .. I may have opted for one of those choices but being clueless that there was such a thing as a \"specials\" board this being my first visit we both ordered burgers upon the recommendation of a friend .. we also had a dozen of the Jack Daniels wings that I wished arrived at the table prior to our meals but that wish was not granted & they did not hit the table until 1/2 way thru the meal .. when asked about a dessert menu we got a blank stare so we just said \"never mind\" .. paid our bill & offered only a mediocre tip based on mediocre service .. food was worthy of a repeat trip however .."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for happy hour with my coworkers and...eh. The first time we (6 or 7 of us) only ordered drinks and no food, and service was fine.  We were all dressed nice since we had come right after work (we used to go to murphys before it closed) and we got quite a few stares..especially from all the old men that were there.  The second time we went, we had a bigger group of work people (about 12) and put together two or three tables to make a big long one. As we were trailing in, one of the servers asked how many were coming. I told her, and she acted like it was the most ridiculous thing that we did not call ahead and let them know.  I really don't know what the problem was since the place wasn't packed and we are by no means a high maintenance group. Plus, when we tried to call other places ahead of time (like the Oak Barrel), they tell us they won't reserve anything for a big group. Shortly after we got there, this waitress ended up leaving.  When we left, we told the other waitress sorry and next time we will call ahead, and she said we didn't have to.  So, I'm not really sure what the deal is there.....  The people I was with seemed to really like their food.  I got the pizza pitas which were decent.  I also got some buffalo boneless wings, and ewe. So gross.  The chicken itself was fine, but I have no idea what sauce was on them.  It was almost like ketchup. I was really disappointed in that.  At first the service was ok, but by the end of the night, our waitress decided to sit down and play on the game machine and we had to get up and ask her for whatever we needed, including the check. This place is ok, a big time townie bar, but definitely somewhere that's my first choice.  More of a place to grab a quick drink or two."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, the staff and atmosphere is really nice, along with the food.    You walk in and seat yourself, the food is classic bar food, and is great if your in the mood for it.  So if your going for Steak, ect. you probably wont go here, but a burger and fries, or home made chips? this is your spot.  The staff is incredibly nice, I have gone a few times and only once they gave me the wrong thing, the waitress immediately got me what I wanted and didn't charge me for the food.  The bar/grills atmosphere is incredibly nice it has a old diner feel and you can tell by the people who attend are all locals like I am.    All in all I can see myself going here for lunch ever now and then."}
{"text":"I was in town for work, and dropped by.  Great little local grill & bar!  I sat at the bar, and bartender Kristi was awesome!  I had a cheeseburger and slaw, and both were excellent. Nothing fancy here...just great bar.   I posted a picture of the menu when I checked in, so take a look there."}
