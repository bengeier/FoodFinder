{"text":"In short, a disappointing visit last night.  Here's why:. no tables available and nobody interested in helping.  Servers walk by customers waiting without even saying hello.  The only seats available were at the bar so my wife and I went there.  One of us sat while the other stood until 2 other patrons left, then we both sat.  The bar wasn't even wiped down for us.  None of our favorite dishes were even on the menu anymore.  They brought out my food but not my wife's.  We waited and waited.  Barkeeps don't even bother looking into why one person has food and the other doesn't.  It wasn't until about 20 minutes later that I decided to ask the server to please check on my wife's pizza.  After some confused debate between the employees, the pizza came out somewhat warm.  By then, my meal was cold, though.  I am in the habit of waiting until we both have our food before eating.  The person \"taking care of us\" was somewhat slow and not on her A-game.  We never expect perfect service, especially at a microbrewery, but when you spend good money on a meal, there are some basic standards you expect.  All in all, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Great brewery with great beers. Beer prices are reasonable as well. Had the wake-and-bake pizza, it was very good with lots of toppings and flavors. Would like to go back during warmer months as they have added an outdoor stage and open up the restaurant for live music. Would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place since the south hills has little good dining places.  It was a let down. The food was mediocre.  The options are limited and there are no entrees, just bar food, sandwiches, pizza and such.  None of the food stood out.    The chili was more like pot roast than chili.  The decor is too industrial for me and the dining room has no warm feel to it.  The building took awhile for its construction and I thought the atmosphere would be a lot better than it is.  The service was bad.  We weren't even done with our appetizer and our main meals were served so everything was on the table at one time.  We felt rushed.  I understand they want to turn over tables quickly but not at the customers expense.  Our waitress was unfriendly and seemed annoyed at all times.  

We were very disappointed and decided when were there that we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"While I've only been here once, it seems like a pretty solid place to grab some drinks. We actually had lunch the day I was there, and sat out on the patio which was really nice. The kid had a good time running around and playing with some other kids that were there too. 

I was a little bummed out with the pizza. Admittedly, I usually go pretty crazy with pizzas, putting every toping under the sun on them, so when I read a line on the menu that said I could only add up to 2 toppings I cried a little on the inside. Still, it was pretty good, and the wedge salad is also one that is a must try.

Finally, on to the beer. I had their stout and I thought it was excellent. We also grabbed a few samplers of their other brews and no complaints! To be fair, had this been a drinking trip, and not a lunch with the family, I'd probably have given this place another star, but today's review is solely based on the full lunch experience.

Definitely give it a try for yourself if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to Spoonwood a handful of times and have always had a great experience.  They have an ever-changing list of beers to try, and their menu is awesome!  I've been for dinner, for apps, and for brunch, and there's always something new and delicious to try.  The management is also amazing - they are walking around making sure everything is great and making sure their staff is doing well.  It is also (surprisingly) family-friendly!  They even have slings for carseats.  We went last week for my husband's birthday and had quite the group - our little baby, our 1 and 4 year old nephews, and my parents - and everyone loved it!  Live music on Thursdays can't be beat."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had, coupled with an excellent selection of IPAs, mead, and other beers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and very reasonably priced.  We were in the area for a wedding and stopped here for some pre-wedding drinks and food. The passion fruit mead is incredible, and it's great to find places making it and serving it. 18% alcohol and it tastes like juice. The cider is delicious. My friends ordered a whole flight and I sampled too. The burgers are excellent--juicy, flavorful. Pretzels with beer cheese are also good, as is the pizza. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was there on opening day. The place was packed. That said I thought the service was pretty good considering how crowded it was. Going in I thought the post industrial interior would make for quite the noisy enviro but I was wrong. I didnt have to scream to order the flight of beers. All of the beers were excellent! I will try the food next time I go on a less busy day. Cant wait to try some of the summer brews at Spoonwood!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite and a pint, but ended up getting wrapped up in the college football vortex and spent the next 3 hours eating and drinking. The beer lineup was awesome. The Killer Diller IPA was my favorite and my wife loved her Belgian Ales and finished the day off with an Arsenal Cider. This is the nicest hangout in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Highly recommend any of the beers all have been delicious(2 minutes to Midnight, stout ). Buratta is unbaleavably tasty."}
{"text":"THERE IS A GIGANTIC JENGA TOWER YOU CAN PLAY. The area is huge and open. There's also an outdoor patio.

Now that is out of the way, let's get to the beers. I love beer and there are tons of breweries in Pittsburgh. So whenever we go to a brewery, my friends and I get a flight of ALL the beers there and then sit around with our pretentious pinkies stuck out sipping on these beers and commenting on them as if we know what we're talking about. 

The beers were good, they just did not stand out among all the amazing breweries in Pittsburgh. While many other places has a specialty (sour Belgian - Draai Laag, IPA - Grist, strong beers - Voodoo, deep/unique flavors - Roundabout), Spoonwood offers many different types that are good, solid beers but none I felt truly stood out in my mind. A lot of the beers felt like a good beer to drink while chilling outdoors on a hot summer day.

Recommendations
Brown Ale - a little hoppier and crisper than other browns I've had.
Killer Diller - screams IPA. Definitely one of the most hoppy beers I've had in recent memory.
Coffee Ale - one of the featured beers, exactly tastes the way you think it will from the name.
Chocolate Town - dark, chocolatey beer that was around 4% alcohol.

Overall, I had a great time and enjoyed the beers. I can totally see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"The outside patio area is a nice space to relax with a drink. If only Spoonwood would spray the area to cut down on bugs(fleas, mosquitos, ants)

Got the Rolls Royce pizza. Delicious! For a nice summer touch, they should top it with thinly sliced canteloupe. That salty-sweet combo would take it from delicious to Incredible!!!"}
{"text":"So happy we stopped here. We were on our way back from the east coast after several cancelled flights. Looked up breweries on the way and picked this off of the other reviews. Not sure how this place only has a 3.75 rating. Take my word for it, we have been to breweries across the country. Great food. Great beer, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Updated review!
2nd experience was fabulous! The food was great, the staff were wonderful. Thanks for making it up to us. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredible beer, and if you are lucky enough to have Todd as your server  the BEST experience ever. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Been in the restraunt a few times and had great service and the food was good.  Wish they had a larger selection.  Brewery had a good selection."}
{"text":"Customer service is effective, friendly, prompt but no frills. You seat yourself.  Our server seemed very busy but attentive at the same time.  They are about pumping out good food quick and keeping the beer coming. 

Food wise I loved the pizza it's a little more the a one person job to eat a pizza. The burgers filled the guys up well and did not leave the hungry yet the were able to eat it and all it came with no trouble.  Sadly the iced tea brined chicken receives lower marks. 

The guys seemed to enjoy the beer and the gluten free among us enjoyed some nice wine. 

I did not check the bathrooms but the rest of the place was spotless. 

Loved the quick service and that it was spacious.  If you have stroller aged kids you can wheel them straight to your table. 

Biggest drawback I have found is can be loud and echoey. I would love to see them add some soft surfaces to bring that down the noise level. Yes it has a bar but this felt beyond bar loud.  We were there for early dinner in the dinning area."}
{"text":"After raking leaves all day on a crisp Autumn day this was the perfect place to have a laid-back dinner with my family.  

The pros: 1 ) great beer selection/great beer (we enjoyed the KILLER DILLER-hoppy and delicious)
 2) the patio-it's cozy, twinkle lights, small stage and if you're a parent like me and dines out with little ones often this is HUGE-a large grassy, gated area for the kids to run around and roam all within safe viewing of the patio
3) the service - friendly, very knowledgable about all their brews
4) romaine wedge salad-they grill the head of lettuce on open flame and serve with applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and cucumbers 
5) community vibe- they have great events every month where you can meet beer/whiskey makers and this month they have fun Halloween themed events
6) grilled brioche bun with burger

The cons: 1) interior atmosphere-overall it's OK, I get they were going for industrial/open concept but there's just no warmth, a little too cold in my opinion 
2) no french fries!  I know I know the salt and pepper chips are good but forgive for being old fashioned and wanting the fries option with my burger
3) iceberg lettuce on my burger along with american cheese - seems that a place that offers such fantastic beers would have more savory cheddar-style options for my burger

Spoonwood is the type of place that we will return time and again because of it's family friendly vibe, good beer and decent menu offerings.  The nice staff and patio are huge pluses."}
{"text":"They recently updated the menu a lot and purchased a smoker and offer different types of smoked meats with two sides (Pork shoulder, chicken, and ribs.) I had the ribs which were really good! My fries were rock hard though and had to be sent back. The head chef (who was really cool by the way) came out and apologized and brought us a new batch out which really weren't that much better. The macaroni and cheese and ribs were delicious which made up for it. I really liked the IPA's they brew fresh in house. It's a great atmosphere inside and also has a nice outdoor area were your kids can run around or you can soak up some vitamin d. This place has already improved a lot since my first visit and I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Beer and food are great, but service needs improvement! Hopefully this can be fixed. Excellent gathering place but no highchairs to fit big table."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good variety of brews and casual, not-too-loud atmosphere. Clean with definite feel of microbrewpub."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided to take a ride to the new brewing company in Bethel. After arriving around eight we put our name in for a table and I ordered a beer and she a sparkling water and just hung out at the bar for a while to take in the sights and smell of fresh beer and wood fired pizza! What goes better with pizza, or what goes better with hand crafted beer !!!!!!! You could tell a lot of thought and planning went into the design, construction and execution of this concept. Service and food were great !"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and very clean. Seating is first come first serve so be ready to hover and pounce! Great prices and great beer."}
{"text":"Pittsburghers and their unwillingness to cross bridges/rivers/etc. What a shame!
You are missing out if you do not go to the South Hills to try Spoonwood Brewing!  This brewery is huge! Lots of space, tables and a large bar. I wanted to try all of the beer! You can order a sample size pour (5oz) which is perfect, cost effective and tasty! I really enjoyed the lorna and dead goon. The food is super tasty and pairs great with their beer. The pizzas are a perfect serving for one or two. I had the pizza with stout onions and spicy sausage-cooked perfectly and so so good! The caprese appetizer was top notch too with fresh tomatoes and balsamic, although it could have used more bread. I would not hesitate again to come back to the South Hills and drink and eat more at Spoonwood!"}
{"text":"Beer is good. Service was ok, not bad but wasn't very attentive either. Ordered a burger medium well, came out medium rare. Asked to have it cooked longer, server was very friendly but it came back burnt. Unfortunately could not enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and food. The burrata in the Caprese was delicious--it melted in my mouth! This was our first visit. We were there on a Sunday without our kids, but it was nice to see so many people dining with their whole families--little kids, teens, parents, grandparents. There is even a Family Bathroom which is nice if you are visiting with little ones. Everything was very clean and tidy and the service was great! We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Like this place. Went early on a Saturday night and was able to sit outside with my wife, son, daughter-in-law and 2 Grandchildren. They had plenty of room to run around outside. Had 3 beers, all were excellent. Food was very good, I had the 1/2 lb burger and was cook to perfection. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Decided to go to an early dinner here and walked into a mad house. We assumed we just seat ourselves so we wandered around to find no tables. I immediately got frustrated as we sat along the back wall on two stools facing the wall. I felt like I was in time out or something while everyone behind us was having fun. 

    A server came over handed us two glasses and a bottle of water and asked \"do you plan to sit here?\" I replied unless there is a table open. He turned right around and pointed at one of their tables which had four people sitting there already but had two open seats and said, \"you got two right here.\" I said umm aren't those people using it. He said \"no bud we have common area seating.\" I laughed as I thought he was kidding but he wasn't. No offense but I don't need to share my table with someone I never met before. This was just as bad as the bench seating people put in their restaurants and you practically hear every word the people next to you say as they do yours.

I told the server we are good here, ordered our food and got out. Food was decent but after I laughed at the fact our server told us to sit with strangers I think he got offended and kind of ignored us, so service was flat out poor. I really felt like I was in timeout then, HA! Never again. I don't understand the concept nor do I want to. Think to yourself, if there are two different groups sitting at one table and one group leaves, do they clean that part of the table off or just remove the plates and not disinfect it? You then have others coming and sitting at a dirty table. And if they do clean it makes it pretty inconvenient for people who are still siting there."}
{"text":"Just went here this past Sunday - Went in around 1 and had no problem getting a seat. (My friends went two weeks ago on a Wednesday evening and the wait was over an hour and half.) I think the atmosphere is pretty cool. It's very different compared to most PGH South Hills eateries.  There were these huge garage doors that I assume will be opened in the warmer months but it did make it very chilly. I'm happy I had my coat to wear during lunch. 

The beers were very cool (a bit expensive but that's expected). The descriptions of the beers were on point! I think we tried all but 1 because they didn't have it available. I could easily crave some of these beers.

The food was lacking. I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food. For example, we ordered the cheese platter ($14). The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread, scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with, a few jumbo olives, and some standard cheeses. We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later, we got 4 more pieces. There were 5 of us - An appetizer that is over $9 should be able to feed more than 3 people.   They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown (understandable since this is still a new business). 

My pizza was pretty amazing though! All of the pizzas sounded delicious - the ingredients were very fresh. Something that was off was that each additional topping was $2?? It's just not worth it here. It's really not. The rest of the table ordered sandwiches. Synopsis, nothing to write home about. The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag. The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag. When everyone was done eating, we all said we could definitely eat more. This also goes back to the substance point I made. 

 I'm not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not? If that's the case then they need to lower the food prices. This place needs some time to figure out how to be \"cool/urban\" while also catering to the area. We like to eat, a lot!  I like that they have different options outside of usual wings, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini selection that are a staple of the South Hills, but don't cheat us! I have high hopes for this place. I'm definitely coming back in a few months and I'm sure it's going to be much more satisfying."}
{"text":"We live right up the road. We watched as our beloved Duke's was dismantled. Our nostalgia was quickly replaced with excitement when we realized that a brewery was moving in. Jackpot! 

Eh, not so much. The beer was okay. I'm far from a beer snob, but I've had much better from other microbreweries in the city. The decor was minimal... In a not so great way. I think this place will be much better in the summer. There were large garage-door looking panels in the back that I'm assuming/hoping open up. Until then, if the Hofbräuhaus went with a more cafeteria motif, that's the ambiance. We couldn't get past the smell, either. It wasn't that perfume-y hoppy smell. It smelled like a frat house, like old, stale beer that had been spilled on the floor days before.

Our bartender acted like we were inconveniencing her and made remarks (that could have been jokes) about precisely how much we were doing just that, but we weren't so sure that she was joking. It was awkward and bad form. There were also extended periods of time where no one was behind the bar. We had our beers and were fine, but watched as other customers at the bar took note of their absence and were pretty annoyed.

I know that new places need time to work out the kinks. I'm sure we'll try it again. I hope to be able to update with a more positive review, especially once we get to try the food. But for now...meh."}
{"text":"Beer was good. Pizza was good. Service was bad. It was the fault of the waitress whom I don't remember the name of. She was convinced that she was way more busy than she really was, and it translated to poor, bordering on rude service. Slow down ma'am! You'll actually be better off! Atmosphere was soured because of the screaming kids. It was like Chucky Cheese with beer. I won't be back on a weekend, but am willing to try again during the week."}
{"text":"We love having Spoonwood nearby! The beer is top notch and they always have a wide selection. I like dark beers and my hubs likes IPAs. This is one of the few places in Pittsburgh where I don't need to look at the tap list before going because I know there will be something I like. And we've always enjoyed the food. 

Recently, we brought a large party for Mother's Day brunch. We were pretty late in making the reservation and Spoonwood went to great lengths to accommodate our needs. They called twice to confirm and had a high chair ready for us on arrival. The food was wonderful and everyone had a great time. 

Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Finally got to journey down here for dinner. I can certainly see where some of the mixed reviews come from. The open seating concept is not my favorite for this setting unfortunately. We were able to find seats but they were up against the back wall which wasn't ideal. Although I'm glad we weren't trying to eat at one of the barrels.

Starting off I was a little nervous as it took a good 10 minutes for us to get a waitress. When she did arrive, things start to speed up. Any time we needed a new beer they turnaround was plenty fast.

We decided to order a garden salad and beet salad, and two pizzas: pierogi and a mushroom pizza. The biggest blunder of the night was that even though our waitress said se put our pizza order in well after our salads, or pizza came first. Without even asking, she took the salads off the bill. This is the proper thing to do, and I'm glad she made it right.

The pizzas were both fantastic, smokey, crisp dough and perfect toppings. Really enjoyed the dash of chili oil on the pierogi pizza.

Beet salad was fresh and tasty, could have used a little vinegar or citrus but the beets and goat cheese were great.

Overall they definitely have some things to improve on since they are apparently very popular, but the food and customer service made up for it on this occasion."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles, EVER! I'd come every Sunday to eat that. Perfect balance of spicy, crispy chicken, malty waffles topped with sweet maple syrup. All washed down with the coffee beer. Mmm, now I'm hungry again"}
{"text":"This brewery has a very large space indoors and a beautiful patio outside with a band stage.for warmer days. The menu was very extensive but we settled for the pizza from their brick ovens and found it to be very delicious. I had almost every beer on their list by ordering flights instead of pints.  The beers were fairly low gravity ales. I would've personally liked to had seen some stouts or triple Belgians but they had some interesting beers nonetheless."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Good beer. Delicious food!!!! Our group tried the mac, wedges, pizza, chicken sandwich, and burger. We were impressed by them all!"}
{"text":"Last evening was my third time there, second time to eat. Place was extremely busy and we had about a 40 minute wait for our party of 4. The beer selection was Okay, not wonderful. My 5 stars is for how they treated us and the experience overall. Our server was nice but at first nothing out of the ordinary. She was helpful with suggestions when asked. I ordered a burger, as did one of the others with us. I ordered medium and she ordered medium well. Our burgers arrived and she bit into hers to find hers more on the medium/medium rare side. I cut mine open to find it more rare. Our server arrived and asked if all was okay. We pointed out the burgers and simply and kindly asked if the could be put back on again. The server was very concerned for us and rushed them away assuring us in a few minutes they would be done to our wishes.  A minute or two later a larger, friendly man arrived and apologized for our burgers. He introduced himself as the chef and assured that our burgers would be perfect. He also said that they had been removed from our bill. Then another man arrived a minute or two later, he was the manager. He too apologized for the burgers, assured ours would be right out and said the burgers are on us. Then the burgers arrived with yet another apology from our server. She asked that we please check them before she left. They were perfect! The customer service we received was amazing and unexpected. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A great brewery! I recently attended the Philly Invades Pittsburgh beerfest here, and it was wonderful. The inside is so spacious and the seating is very nicely arranged. Easy access to the bar and patio. The beers on tap are great, and always revolving. But I think the real winner of this place is the food. I think its excellent. The nachos are huge, and have so much stuff on top. The pizza is insanely good."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, but I wasn't really into the menu items and the beers weren't my favorite. I'll definitely go here again because I know that it's really well liked."}
{"text":"Emily is an exceptional bartender!  I continue to be impressed with the food, service and atmosphere! Nice job!!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how in love I am with Spoonwood Brewery! We have been there for dinner on multiple occasions for their Thursday night live music to a random Saturday night to eat and drink their wonderful beer.  Every meal I have ever had there has been so tasty and delicious, I don't know where these cooks came from!  The pizza's... all of them... awesome!  The local burger is one the best I have had, trumps BRGR or Burgatory. The beer is always so tasty and great pricing for craft beers.  If you have a chance, stop in for their brunch on Sunday's, they have a great a la cart breakfast menu and they take reservations!  One of the best spots in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"4 stars sums of this place perfectly.  It is a great new space and the wait staff are so friendly but serve small, pretty pricey entrees.  It was packed on a Friday evening and was seat yourself.  Loved the round barrels they turned into tables. We found a seat at the bar and had a great bartender that let me try 2 kinds of beer before deciding on their version of a pumpkin beer.  It was on the strong side but reasonably priced. You can also get $2 5 oz pours and my boyfriend tried a few of their brews this way.  The menu isn't huge but a lot of great pizza options. I went with the pulled pork sandwich with homemade chips and blue cheese slaw. It was delicious!  The chips had an amazing sour cream and onion type seasoning and the blue cheese slaw was the best I have had. My boyfriend got the pizza special of the week pierogi which had mashed potatoes, cheese and bacon.  The pizza was small but very tasty.  We were still hungry after the small portions so we went for the chunky monkey dessert which was a homemade grain chocolate chip cookie, caramelized bananas and caramel sauce. The only thing missing was vanilla ice cream-it really needed it but none the less still decadent!  I asked our friendly bartender about tours and she lined one right up with one of the brew masters. I could not believe this on a busy Friday night!  He could not have been nicer and gave us a really nice tour of the place. I cannot wait to go back, sit on the patio and try one of their summer favorites, a marmalade beer."}
{"text":"Being a former Bethel Park resident, I have been wanting to go here for awhile and finally went for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. 

The beer and food were both delicious! I first ordered the Cinnamon Ghoul. It was the perfect amount of pumpkin and cinnamon flavor. For my second beer, I ordered the Secret Alphabet. The jalapeno flavor was amazing. I was a big fan of this beer. To eat, I ordered The Jam burger and it was also very good. I would definitely get it again.

The atmosphere at the beginning of the night (around 5:00) was very laid back. But it quickly got busier and more packed inside. It is not a very big place so it also got louder throughout the evening.

I will definitely go back again but I might stick with visiting in the afternoon for lunch when it isn't as busy."}
{"text":"We happened to be driving on Baptist Road and discussing where to go for lunch, when we passed by. Bingo! 

I think it's been open for a bit over a year, but this was our first visit. The inside of the place was cavernous and while it was pretty quiet when we were there, i can see that it would become a noise problem with the place full. Concrete floors and high ceilings with views of the rafters and the piping means that noise does not get attenuated.

The main reason we came there was to try the food, but I have to say some good words about the beers. First of all, there was a very wide selection. There were the beers they normally brew, and also over a dozen choices of specialties. So many, in fact, that we had a hard time deciding on what to try. Apparently we are not alone as they offered a $2 taste of any beer you want. It comes in a cute little beer glass to boot! This way, we could try a few of the more interesting combinations. Great idea and great execution. Kudos to the owners!

As far as the food went, we tried the Sweet Potato Bisque; the mushroom pizza; and the Gnocchi with roasted vegetables. The Bisque was somewhere disappointing as they must have used an immersion blender on the veggies and so it was full of little bits of stuff. I was expecting a smooth blend and so was disappointed. Also, the only flavor was of sweet potatoes, and they must have been enhanced with some sugar or agave as it was quite sweet. More than most people would appreciate.

On the other hand, the Gnocchi and the Pizza were first rate. The Gnocchi was a true potato Gnocchi and was definitely hand made in the restaurant. That is the only way you can get that dense consistency - rather than what many other places serve that is so light and flavorless! The pizza was a bit overdone so there was more of a char flavor than we wanted, but on the other hand it was not greasy at all and the mushrooms and cheese complemented each other extremely well. 

We could not finish our meals so got the chance to eat them another day and they were just as tasty! Definitely a hit and definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Was pretty jazzed up about this place, then I got there... Apparently they don't believe in a functional seating system. \"First come, first serve.\" As in get there and it's every man for themselves! After 45 minutes of looking for a table, 2 of the 4 people I was with had to stand at our table until we found extra seats. Beer was average as was their food. Until they get a way to seat human beings without us hovering over people at their tables to get up, I will not be back."}
{"text":"So I wasn't impressed with the new Spoonwood Brewery..  Not very big on the inside.. It's seat yourself.. We ended up at barrel table with backless low stools which wasn't comfortable...  The beers were ok but pricy..  The food menu was very limited..  I had a turkey sandwich which was good.. But they brought it out and it was almost 15 min before the other meal came out (which was a pizza that my two friends shared)..my boyfriend is still hungry so we are at the garden bar so he can get a supplement meal.. Lol..  Doubt I would go back to Spoonwood.."}
{"text":"Good beer, but the not service. 1pm on Saturday, service was so so until 3pm when new server came on. Then it was terrible. Had to flag someone (not our server) down twice just to get help. Ended up leaving at 5pm after only having been served once in last hour. They need to hire some seasoned servers desperately."}
{"text":"Beer was awesome. Food was NOT. Service was eh.
We both got burgers which were EXTREMELY bland. No flavor or seasoning whatsoever. Just because you slap some sauce on top doesn't mean you don't have to season the meat itself. Mac and cheese and potato salad sides also were completely flavorless. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, we wanted to try something new and different.  Being beer snobs, we loved the variety and fresh aspect of the menu and beer.  

The menu is definitely the way to keep the ppl coming.  The new take on certain thinga is delicious.   

Our favorite item is the pulled pork nachos.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the fuss about this place. Unfriendly wait staff, overpriced beer and not a whole lot of atmosphere. Cleaner than when it was Dukes but missing something.  Atmosphere feels like you're drinking in a Subway inside of a Wal-Mart.  Didn't try their food so no comment on that, but the new Cool Springs bar around the corner is a lot more fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Great beer and food selection.  I have been there to eat once and the food was incredible.  It was super fresh and they rotate the menu regularly and keep the menu seasonal.  Great pizza and apps.  The only downside is that the place gets absolutely packed with people parking in the busy road.

I usually stop by for a quick beer, six pack or to get a growler filled.  All of the beers I have tried have been amazing."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening after a day of skiing. We had tried to go on a Saturday night on the weekend after the Super Bowl and it was absolutely packed. I couldn't get a seat. So we tried again on a quieter night and were immediately seated.

Service was friendly and quick. We had our six year-old with us and they were smart about taking his food order early (unprompted!) and serving it pretty quickly. My wife ordered a Mead (not theirs) and enjoyed it. I had a flight of beer (Belgian porter, Smoked Ale and a hoppy American Strong Ale). Each beer was well-balanced and very drinkable. I settled on a second glass of the Belgian porter, which was smooth and tasty.

My wife ordered a bacon sandwich with cheese and onions. She loved it. I had a pizza with a unique plum tomato sauce. I ordered my pizza with prosciutto and peppers. The taste was pretty good, though I wish it had more peppers on it and for some reason, the prosciutto was placed on the pizza after cooking. That was a surprise, but it didn't taste bad. 

All in all, this is a welcome addition to the area and, given that it's 10-15 minutes from our house and reasonably priced, a place we will definitely put on our regular rotation.

Also, for beer drinkers out there, they WILL fill third-party growlers."}
{"text":"Great beer, great service and fantastic food. Pizza is one of those thin crust and really good. I had soups there: really good
I had octopus with orzo and vegetable: yes, delicious octopus in a brewery. Who would guess? It was the best I had so far.
Taco is good too. And anything else you order you will not be disappointed.  Chef is very enthusiastic and will prepare some dished that will surprise you in creativity. 
Highly recommended place to chill
A wide variety of beer and stuff is super knowledgable. 
Cheers."}
{"text":"Update:  With warm weather,  the outside area is open.  I love the idea of hanging with friends, drinking beers, and playing corn hole.  Only to find...a childrens playground in the back.  Kids should not be playing corn hole.  This is an adult game that usually includes drinking.  This is a big turnoff to me. Family places are Kings and Eat n Park, not a brewery.  Couldn't enjoy the corn hole because kids were occupying the game and area.

The beers are CLEAN and tasty and not overdone with spices, hops, etc.  Really good beer.  Food is good but pricey.  Would be nice if they included more 'bar' food.  Some fries, pizza slices, chicken bites, etc.

As far as the seating...get a grip people!  I understand what they are trying to do and most BREWERIES (it's not a family restaurant people) have communal seating.  It's so you can sit with your 'neighbors' and enjoy some brews together and talk and make new friends.  I like the idea.  Maybe it's just something too progressive to the South Hills."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good wood-fired pizza so when I read about Spoonwood (and its wood-fire oven) in an article about new, off the beaten path, restaurants in Pittsburgh, I had to stop in to try one. My husband and I were with a few of our friends when we came here on a fall afternoon. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside. The pizzas here have pretty creative topping combinations; I didn't see any simple offerings like a margherita. We ordered the Rolls Royce, the Heater and a pulled pork sandwich, accompanied by some of their brews. I was very happy with our food choices. The crust tasted just right (not too salty or too burnt) and the creative topping combos complemented each other very nicely. The beers were great and so was the mead! All in all, I will definitely keep this place in mind when I'm in the south hills area."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the modern decor beers are good some different ones and good selection. Their pizzas are great."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The only negative was it was very hard to find parking (large lot also).
The pizza, beer and service were excellent!"}
{"text":"Been to Spoonwood twice...very industrial look...no ambiance at all. Beer was so so and VERY EXPENSIVE. Low quality bar food. Get a second mortgage before going...4 dinners (sandwiches) and 4 beers cost me over $125....lots of better places to go."}
{"text":"Urban style eatery out here in the suburbs! We just sampled the beers, there were too many to decide on just one full glass. And they rotate them quickly so there were lots of new ones to try. First time for dinner - there were actually seats! Thin crust wood fired pizzas are good to share. The Reuben pizza is especially a delicious twist on an ordinary pizza. And the grilled romaine wedge salad is amazing! The blue cheese dressing is creamy and flavorful, and definitely add the grilled chicken on top!"}
{"text":"This was a nice spot to grab some drinks while visiting Pittsburgh. I was worried that it was going to be to crowded when we pulled up to the fill parking lot, but this place is so big we had no problem finding a table.  

They had a nice selection of beer on tap and everything I tried was pretty good.  The In the Black Stout was especially yummy.  I didn't try any of the food, but from what I saw everything looked good.  If I lived in the area I would frequent this place often."}
{"text":"Precursor: I live in San Diego the #1 city for beer ATM. However, I am originally from Pittsburgh so it's cool to see that there's a craft brew scene beginning here. 

The beer was actually pretty good! The waiting however...not the best. We were pushed to either chug our beers and leave or order another which made the environment unsettling. It's a shame as I'd definitely go back here if it weren't for this. They were very busy so I can understand some hustle but we spent over $200 on beer and food and were treated like we had ordered bread and water."}
{"text":"Have been waiting awhile to check out Spoonwood. We went around 5:30 pm and we were able to get a table right away. 
The place is extremely family friendly with an extensive menu that includes a kids menu. 
I got the Hydra Slayer beer with the Grown Up Grilled Cheese. The beer was 5 stars while I would give my sandwich 3 stars. It was just okay but certainly wasn't bad. 
I ordered my daughter the chicken strips. Loved that it was cut up chicken breast marinated. She loved it and ate it all up. 
My hubby got the chicken and artichoke pizza. He said it was good but not outstanding. He would come back and try another pizza. 
They have a ton of high chairs and a family restroom which is awesome. 
We left around 7 and it was packed with people waiting on a table. 
We will definitely be back around the 5:30 time frame:)"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Clean lines and open space. It looked like they had a backyard area, but it was cold and we didn't go out. I liked that I could order a few 5oz samplers and not be tied down to any 1 beer my first time there. Killer Diller IPA was delicious, Freemang was a little too sweet for my liking. I didn't eat but they have a stone pizza oven which looked awesome. They also have brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Bethel over a year ago and frequent this place often.  I like that the menu is always changing,  but for being kid friendly, the kid's menu stinks.   Not every kid eats Dino nuggets or burgers.  A little innovation would be nice since the adult menu is always so interesting.  We enjoy the fact there is music most evenings when the doors are open to the outdoors.  It reminds us of many places in Europe with the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Awesome craft beer selection.  I tried 4 different beers and loved them all.  Stout was my fav."}
{"text":"Great Beers and Great food. Really love the locally brewed beers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a small group of friends on a Saturday night. Loved the atmosphere. It was warm enough to enjoy the back patio, which is decked out in string lights that just make me so happy. There is a cornhole courtyard as well, but that was swarmed with children. There was a stage for live music and I look forward to visiting Spoonwood again on a night where that's happening! Both the indoor, outdoor and bar areas are very large. 

I ordered a pizza. It was good. I appreciate that the bar serves liquor (wigle whiskey) and wine in addition to their many beers. 

There was tons of parking, which is nice not to worry about."}
{"text":"The food was not good. Got a burger and the burger was as thick as a McDonald's burger. My daughter got chicken nuggets and they were \"dino nuggets\". Waitress was at another table our whole stay. She did not bring us anything we ordered..others did. She came to out table once to see if we needed anything. The beer was the only thing that was good. Will not go back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a real nice spot to enjoy some craft beers. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and a couple of their beers, a Porter and an IPA. Both were excellent, especially the IPA, which I think they called Freemang. It was refreshing and citrusy, with around 6.8% ABV. 

I didn't have any food, but their menu looked interesting with a lot of different choices, including pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and entrees. Prices were slightly on the higher side. 

The best thing was the layout of the space and ambience. The brewery has a very large big open room with high ceilings and a spacious bar. There's a patio outside. I found a spot at the bar without a problem. They have a big screen TV behind the bar and also in other spots. They were playing the audio from the Steelers game that was in while I was there. 

Really looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it gets better each time. Great open space.  Nice outdoor seating. Sun was shining this weekend so it was great.  I've had a few of their beers and thing they are pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but up there for sure. Very friendly staff. The food is really good. I've had a bit of everything and always enjoy. Only downfall is it's a 40 min drive for me"}
{"text":"I basically wanted to try the food here since I don't drink. 15.00 for 3 wings that were nothing special. Small hamburger with potato chips on the side for 11.00, very average. Loud and service was slow. A hip place for the young crowd!"}
{"text":"This place is the business for any beer afficianado, or person that wants wood fired pizza that is unique and delicious, period.  Here is why: The quality of the food is high, the service is fast, efficient and friendly and the beer tastes fresh and balanced.
  To start the beers off I had the blackmore black ale, the icarus belgian brown ale and the white hot rage Belgian wit.  All three were excellent.  I am a very picky craft beer lover and their brews are on point.  The Icarus brown ale is a wheat beer that is slightly sweet with a licorice forward flavor with notes of cocoa and spice.  It packs alot of flavor and you don't really taste the alcohol as much.  The blackmore black ale really tastes like a nice hardy, coffee stout.  It has a nice bitterness to it and even has a nice scent from the hops used.  Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to the beer scene in Pittsburgh.  Their beers are outstanding.  The happy hour special with $4 drafts is great along with their incredible wood fired pizza!  The service has been been adequate.  I appreciate the bottle of water for the table, though on the first visit I had to ask for it after seeing it at every other table but ours. So happy to have this gem so close to home."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. I still haven't gotten to try the food, but the beer, cider and mead is always delicious! The service is fast, and the atmosphere is very cool. I can't wait to try out the outside part once summer finally comes!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this because I've heard great things about this new spot but I was not very impressed. I understand they are a brewing company and they only have beers they personally brew but most weren't very tasteful and the liquor choices were quite odd. Also our waitress didn't know a damn thing about the menu; everything about the menu sounded delicious but all came out very bland and dry. The atmosphere is the only reason I'd go back, it's a nice place to relax and listen to music if they have someone playing. I'll definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Love coming here! We have come here a few times since they opened. We came on opening night which was great and packed! The beer is really good and flavorful. We prefer ipa beers. Their ipa's are good! This place is good for the weekend and groups of people! They usually have different fun events going on. The pizza is really good and home made! Parking can be a little rough sometimes, they usually have a lot of people there and even with the big parking lot that they have, people are always parking up and down the road as well! I didn't like their wings when we ordered them, and I'm a big wing fan usually. They taste burned. They do have an oversized Jenga set which is fun to play! Overall, great place for food, drinks, and friends!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could rate this brewery but considering we gave the host our name and was told it was a half hour wait, and my husband and I waited an hour. We watched the host walk past us a dozen times and not acknowledge us. At one point the host ask me if a man who stood by the bathroom door was seated yet. Really Terrible service and a major disappointment considering my husband and I live 5 minutes down the street from Stonewood. We will never be back after how rude and not acknowledged we feel. Please note the host sat people at tables who just walked in, older men who seemed to know the host as a friend. Total discrimination!"}
{"text":"We haven't visited in some time, but we used to come almost every week. We typically spend around $100 a visit for our family of 4. Tonight's visit was terrible and I don't think we will return soon. 

They changed the burgers from having 1 decent option to 4. They now offer a single or a double. Instead of a thick juicy patty, they are offering a thin, probably 4 ounce patty for the single. The waitress asked for temperature and I ordered medium rare. What I got was dry and overcooked. It was supposed to have a garlic aioli (got it on the side) and it honestly tasted like popcorn butter. 

Our waitress never checked on us after getting our food,otherwise I was going to complain about the burger. Haven't ever seen her there in past visits. Not the friendliest or welcoming experience. 

Overall, I was disappointed since we've enjoyed the place countless times in the past."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but there's a lot to like. For example, the FOOD.  I've had a burger that was excellent. They must be grinding their own beef, because the party itself was way flavorful. I'm not a fan of crazy burger toppings, but they nailed the basics so well I have to call it out. 

The gruyere bacon mac and cheese was  okay, but frankly, a bit of a letdown. Still good, but not that special or amazing. Maybe it's just me. 

My lovely wife had a more traditional beef roast with some veggies that she really enjoyed. I was also intrigued by the pizzas I saw going to other tables. I need to go back and try a pizza. 

The only slight negative is that the dining room is one, big room, and on a very cold evening, it gets too cold in there, just from patrons entering and leaving from the outside. I looked around and most of the customers were keeping their coats on while they dined."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon after an appointment nearby.  We actually passed it by the first time because it sits a bit back from the road.  Once we pulled into the lot I was delighted with the enormous space and the clean modern look of the outside that continues to flow right on into the entrance, bar, and table area.  This space was open, airy, but industrial and chic looking.  I loved the look.

We decided to sit at the bar and grab a couple of beers.  I decided on the Killer Diller IPA.  It was great.  Refreshing, hoppy but not overpowering.  I perused the menu for some time before I decided to try a dish from their smoker.  Several things sounded delicious but I was pretty hungry and wanted a meal that would stick with me for a while.  I went with the one meat, two sides which were ale brined half chicken, with roasted potato wedges, cornbread, and pickled vegetable collard greens.  I can't recall the price but it was reasonable especially for the amount of food.  

We enjoyed some more beers and atmosphere while waiting.  Upon arrival my food look awesome.  I dove right in, and the bartender introduced a few sauces to sample with your meal.  I tried the spicy one and found it to my liking.  The chicken was nice and moist on the dark meat side but a little dry on the breast.   This required some sauce, and the problem was averted.   The flavor of the meat was really smokey true BBQ.  The sides were a little disappointing but not a wash.  The collard greens could have used a little more salt and I like them cooked down a little more, they were a tad crunchy.  And the potatoes would have benefited from being left in the oven a little longer.  A few were a bit hard and one was raw in the center.  It was only one so no need to send them back based off one but still a little inconsistency.  

Overall, great lunch, good food, awesome beer and interior.  I also noticed the open outdoor seating that would be perfect in the summer.  I really can't wait to come back.  Oh how I wish you were closer Spoonwood!"}
{"text":"It says a lot that I'm willing to drive 30 plus minutes to a brewery for just a couple drinks.  But Spoonwood has proven on more than one occasion that they are worth the ride.

My first time there I sampled everything.  Yes, everything.  My table was a gorgeous display of tasting glasses of various colors from a lighter yellow to a darker brown.  My favorite combo by far has been the Wake N Bake pizza with a glass of Cold Drip City.

The parking lot is always packed and sometimes you have to search around for a seat (they have tables, bar and high table seating).  Service is usually pretty good but can be slow with the refills if the place is busy.  They have at least ten of their beers on tap in a wide variety of styles.  My game is usually to have two beers, maybe start with a sample or two of something I haven't tried and then a full pint of something I like.  And then 2 or 3 more beers.  

I've noticed what looks like a patio out back.  Some outdoor space here would be a great addition for events or just more much needed seating. 

The beers keep me coming back and their Facebook posts now include their daily food specials.  The food is good but a bit pricey.  When combined with the beers, though, I feel like it's a good deal.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great food, great vibe! This place has an awesome outside seating area and a huge yard. Bring a frizzby or football to throw around. The beer was very good and there's a decent selection. I think there were about ten different beers. Try it you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Recently had a disappointing experience here.  I had made brunch reservations for a birthday outing on a recent Sunday.  My party included six people, one of which was partially disabled. When we arrived, they attempted to seat us at a bar-height table section.  I shared that we had a disabled party member who could not sit on a high bar stool.  The greeter simply said \"sorry, that's all we have\" and walked away.  No attempt to accommodate, ask anyone else for help or ideas, or even show any empathy.  I asked about two low tables that were set but not yet occupied, and were told that those were reserved for another party (who obviously wasn't there yet).  No thought or mention of maybe relocating them to the bar-height tables and giving us that table.  Maybe that party also required special accommodations, but there was no effort to explain at all.

In the future, I'll make sure to mention special needs when booking the reservation.  That said, the total lack of effort and empathy here was highly disappointing!

UPDATE:  Upon seeing this review, the owner contacted me via Yelp with an offer to make things right, which I certainly appreciated.  I told him I was open to coming back for another try, and he said he'd have the General Manager contact me to make arrangements.  Over the next few weeks, the owner emailed me a few additional times to see if I'd been contacted, and each time I responded back that I had not.  Nearly a month later now, and the GM has never made any attempt to follow up with me at all.  I really do appreciate the effort that the owner put in to try to fix things, but it seems like he needs to work on his staff a bit."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to check out Spoonwood after driving by it countless times.  I'm not a big beer drinker but I had heard their woodfired pizzas were something to write home about. I tried their \"Wake & Bake\" pizza as well as the Bianca, to which I added ricotta and basil.  Both were excellent. The dough is perfectly thin and flavorful, and you can't beat that crunch from a woodfired pizza oven!  Their nachos are also heavenly... I can't rave enough about their homemade beer cheese!  I would probably put it on everything if they let me.  The atmosphere is fun, though it can get a bit loud because of the size of the space. The decor is simple and industrial. I hope to get back here on a summer night to enjoy their outdoor space!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to visit this place for months. Hubs & I were out for the day running errands, in the early evening--we were close so decided to stop. The interior was really modern, industrial & hip. The music was loud but it was a great mix of variety! We sat at the bar. Beer menu was good, too bad 2 were kicked. We were happy with beers we ordered, though amounts were smaller than what we expected for the price. The food--pizza & fish tacos were very good, though. We will be back & I do recommend trying it out. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere!! Good beer, menu was small at first but they expanded, food is delicious, service could be better, big Jenga game, back patio, garage door back walls that open up, always too crowded and never enough parking. Good place to stop for a quick delicious oven fired pizza and beer!! Best beer is their ipa beer and the coffee beer . Newly added brunch on Sunday's, really enjoyed it!!!! Deffinately reccommend !!"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT!  The pizza is one of my favorites and the cheese plate is definitely worth ordering.  My husband and I could make a meal out of the cheese plates.

Brunch is great as well.  We've gone 2x for brunch now and I always get the shrimp and grits.  Top notch bloody Mary too - bacon and pickles on a skewer make it a hit.

I like to try samplers of the beer when we go and have not tried one that i didn't enjoy yet.  They also carry Apis Mead, which I highly recommend trying, as well as other local spirits, such as Wigle Whiskey and Arsenal cider.  So even if you're not a beer drinker, there's still something available to you.

I'd give this place 5 stars if they restricted kids after a certain point of the evening.  When going out for an adult night at a brewery, it catches you a bit off guard to see and hear kids in the place.  I understand that there are parents who want to try the place out, but after a certain point on a Friday or Saturday it just seems out of place, especially with the communal seating arrangement."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was being built. They are really improving this area of Baldwin- first with Cool Springs & now the addition of Spoonwood. I waited to visit until the hype died down a little bit, in an attempt to avoid it being super crowded. We came on a Saturday night around 10pm- they close early, like most breweries, so we planned on just trying a couple beers & heading out. We met a couple of our friends who visited for dinner- they said it was pretty crowded between 8-9:30pm. I had the opportunity to try 3 beers- the Freemang IPA, Festbier and Straw in the Wind. The Freemang was pretty good- citrusy & hoppy, but with a slighty odd aftertaste, 3.5/5. The Festbier is their Oktoberfest- and it was delicious. Smooth, easy to drink, kind of sweet with the right amount of malt- 4.5/5. I started with the sample size of the Festbier & had to order a full size after falling in love with it. The last beer I tried, Straw in the Wind, is their American Pale Wheat ale. It was good- light, sweet & citrusy, 3/5. I wasn't going to order food, but their Hawaiian style pizza was calling my name. It was a seasonal special with ham, bacon, pineapple & a sriracha bbq sauce. It was good- although the sauce was disappointing. It was either regular pizza sauce & the kitchen staff forgot about the Sriracha BBQ, or it was just flavorless. The bacon, ham, pineapple & gooey cheese made up for the sauce- but it was still a little disappointing.

I was surprised with how small this place is on the inside. I was expecting a larger dining area. Some tables are actually barrels, which is a cool concept for 2 people who are just hanging out & having some drinks, but I can imagine it would be a little tight, even for just 2 people, to have dinner on a barrel. It was cold when we visited so the garage doors were shut, but I would have loved to have visited in the summer/spring when they were open- the outdoors area looks awesome.

It was late when we visited, so we didn't have trouble with parking. Many reviews talk about the horror of their parking lot- so I would plan accordingly when making a trip.

We plan on returning on a Thursday night- when they have live music."}
{"text":"We have been here once before a year ago but the service wasn't great and the food mediocre. We were in the area and thought we would give it one more chance. I called ahead to ask if there was a wait, the man who answered the phone said \"nope! Come on in.\" I even asked if I should at least put my name in and he replied \"there are a ton of open tables, you'll be fine,\" with confidence. We walked in 4 minutes after we hung up, and it was a 30 minute wait. Needless to say, that was the last chance we give to Spoonwood. The hostess took ten minutes to grab the guy who \"might have\" answered the phone and he had no words or apology or idea who answered the phone and told me that. Unfortunately I'll be giving this review to everyone who frequents my business."}
{"text":"I feel obligated to write a review on here since we went on a weeknight, and then the very next night went to Mindful and had an absolutely terrible experience, and I reviewed Mindful.

We went to Spoonwood on a Thursday night as mentioned, and it was happy hour, so of course we had to wait for a table. However, it didn't look that crowded, and so I think that's where my biggest issue with this place comes in: there is SO much usable space that is just left empty. For example, the tables are so far spaced apart, and second, the odd barrels in the front of the restaurant look cool, but I have trouble comfortable sitting at them to eat, as did my over 6-foot tall husband. However, the drinks made up for the awkward seating choice, and eventually, we were too content to get up and move or notice any longer.

We ordered the plain ol burger (husband) and the margherita pizza (me) and all in all we were both extremely happy with our choices. Although our waitress left us hanging with empty beers and waiting to order dinner for far too long, our food came out in just under ~8 minutes, which made up for it. Notching a couple stars due to the awkward barrel seating, and the fact that we ordered the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and the pretzels were definitely pre-frozen and heated up - not good for a $9 appetizer.

All in all, a much better experience at Spoonwood than Mindful Brewing down the road the night after. I will definitely be back to Spoonwood in the near future, and will most likely order the pizza again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here... especially in the summer when the garage doors are open! They also have live music on certain nights and corn hole and life-size Jenga to play.

I visited Spoonwood with two friends for happy hour and dinner. They have a great beer selection that changes often, as well as offering locally produced wines and ciders. They also have many IPA options, which I enjoy. My favorite beers here are the Secret Alphabet (hint of jalapenos) and Froot Loop (citrus IPA), while my friends enjoyed the Working Class Hero and Arsenal Cider.

I had a bowl of the soup of the day which was a stuffed pepper soup. It was served piping hot and was delicious! I would also recommend the pierogi pizza (or any of the pizzas here for that matter)!

My friends ordered the white bean tartine, which was a large sourdough bread roll with beans, arugala, and a balsamic reduction. It was very \"hearty\" and filling."}
{"text":"We were back in town for a wedding and decided to stop by since I had heard so many good things about the food and beer from friends in the area. It did not disappoint! We shared a variety of the tasting size glasses (favorites were the Stunt Double kolsch and Secret Alphabet chili pepper pale) and also got our own pizzas. The crust on the pepperoni pizza was perfect and it was the perfect size for a meal. The beers all had a distinct and different taste, some like the Secret Alphabet combining flavors I would never think could work in a beer (but really did)! If you happen to be in the South Hills and want to try a truly unique brew you must stop by!"}
{"text":"Spoonwood's beer is really good but the brewpub needs to a lot of work to be enjoyable.

The beer is great and the pricing is reasonable.  The Cold Drop City coffee ale is fantastic.  Each beer was good.  The 5 oz samples were nice.  I don't care for the glass beer can cups, I'd prefer a standard pint glass.

The brewpub is the meh part.  The bar is nice and bright.  I like a bright bar.  There were enough TV's but not an overabundance.

The table seating is a chaotic.  Seat yourself doesn't work in a crowd.  There are people wondering around hovering over your table.  It isn't enjoyable at all.  I watched two groups of people flock to tables as folks were getting up.  Spoonwood needs to get a host.

The food was good but not great.  They seemed like they were trying.  I'm happy it wasn't Sysco stuff, but I think the cooks were rushed.  The pizzas were under cooked in the center.

As a note, parking is extremely problematic.  Carpool."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us decided to try out Spoonwood Brewing arriving at 6:15 on a Sat. night..  The Manager was accommodating and helped us to the side bar to order drinks and wait for a table to open up.  It is community seating, so you have to wait for a table or part of a table to open up to sit down.  We did find half of a table and some of us sat and some of us stood. Since it was our first time here we asked the waitress about some of her favorite beers.  She decided to explain to us that this is not your average beer distributor and if you came in to order a Corona Light this is not your place.  Well, that was not our intention.  We simply wanted to know her favorite and what she would recommend.  She made us feel rushed from the moment we sat down.  Hurrying our orders, taking our glasses out of our hands, and asking every few minutes if she could clear the table.  When we didn't order any more to eat or drink she brought over our check.  My friend actually wanted to order another beer, but she had 1/2 of a glass left and wanted to finish it.  I don't usually give poor reviews, but I know if this was my establishment I would want to know how the customers feel about their experience.   My advice is to slow down, talk to the customers, and smile:)"}
{"text":"First of all the beer.. It's excellent and it's always changing. Great brews like coffee drip, and marmalade wheat. From lite to very heavy dark beer they are all good.
The food is great also, it's there is a wood fired oven so they make great pizza and snacks.
Plus, as a bonus, they have outdoor seating and live music on Thursday nights in the old spot where dukes station used to be.
Happy to have them in my backyard"}
{"text":"I am looking forward to coming back. 

This place has great beer. I had their Belgian ale, and the coffee ale. I would drink both again and I am very picky about the beer I drink.

We went for lunch and the food selection was a little limited. On the plus side one of the owners came to talk with us and get our opinion of the food and beer. This type of hospitality is what makes me enjoy local restaurants and breweries. The fact that the owner cares enough to see how everything is and ask how they can do things better is great. 

We started out with the pretzel bites, these are the delicious pretzels that can be found just down the road at the Pittsburgh pretzel shop. 

For food, I ordered the turkey sandwich. It came on a delicious roll with smoked cheese, some greens, and a tomato pesto type of sauce. It was very good. Presentation of the food was excellent and service was fast and friendly. 

This is the type of place to take out of towners and give them a real sense of some of the great things Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"My family visited spoonwood this evening for the first time. My husband and I both had the Killer Diller IPA which was very good and reasonably priced. We ordered an appetizer (pretzel bites) -- the cheese dip was good. The pretzels were just alright but not very warm. I had the fish tacos which were ok, though not very flavorful and again, not hot. My husband had the burger. He said it was alright but the meat was kind of bland. We also ordered two kid's meals -- grilled cheese and chicken tenders. I thought they were very overpriced for kids meals. I think they were $8 each and not very good. The chicken tenders did not look appealing at all. Overall, we thought it was slightly overpriced and the atmosphere feels a bit sparse and uncomfortable. I would say, go for the beer, not the food."}
{"text":"I love Spoonwood!!! From the rotating beers to the friendly staff. The patio is great for a summer night and they often have live music. They get busy, but it is worth dealing with a crowd. The beer is enough to visit here but they also have yummy food."}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th time to Spoonwood, and it reminded me of why the never go to this place. Beer is fine, service is bad, food is AWFUL. An entree at Spoonwood starts at $10 and the price goes up from there. This is expensive considering the lack of flavor and the amount of food you get. I ordered brunch today. An omelette, which was completely flavorless containing BURNT mushrooms and BURNT bacon. I ordered home fries with it, because the menu doesn't say anything about the entree coming with a side. The waitress (who looks completely irritated by her job) says nothing about it coming with a side, yet when my meal comes, I get home fries, and more home fries. Great. Now I get to pay $4 more for a side of bland potatoes on top of the $10 I am already paying for my meal. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Great beer and food but the seating system is dumb.  It's like the Hunger Games trying to get a table. Walk in and wait to see if a party is ready to leave then circle like vultures to claim their table hoping that the people who just walked in behind you don't  swoop in to claim it.  I've walked out of there more times than I've gotten a table. What's the point of this system?"}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times and now I suppose it is time to write a review. 

To start, the beers. The beers are well balanced and full of flavor... A little lack in lace and head but none the less.. Very tasteful brews. 

Now onto food. I have been trying a different menu item/s each time I've come in and have come to this conclusion. The food, for what this place is striving to be, is on point. Just the right amount of substance to fill up and drink on (For safety's sake of course).  I find the pizza to be exceptional. A total home run.  I've read through some reviews that were not happy with the portions... Remember, this is a brewery, not Atrias. The menu is rustic and elegant...more bistro style, a light satisfying meal. 

The atmosphere is perfect. Living in bethel park I often find myself escaping the bland suburbaness on the weekends downtown. Spoonwood helps fill that void. The industrial, low lit, atmosphere gives the urban feel close to home. It's comforting. I like the community based seating too. Drink local, make new friends, I love it. 5 stars every day."}
{"text":"We've been here once before and at that time they just had pizza and beer, but we decided to give it another try since their beer was really good. Thankfully,  they expanded their menu and now have salads, burgers, pizzas and a bunch of other foods! 
I had the wake n bake pizza, veggie pizza, and the local burger. All were delicious! We've had a few of their beers and this time we took home a growler of the Good Eye Sniper double IPA. It was so so so good! And my boyfriend is a Coheed and Cambria fan so the name made it even better (for him lol) 

My only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is they do self seating. If you go on a Friday or Saturday evening for dinner, you almost have to stalk people down to get a table. I also would have probably stayed and drank more beer if this couple wasn't staring at us waiting for us to finish our beers. In fact, that couple came to get our seats as we were putting our coats on. They were sitting down before I could even grab my purse lol

Let's hope they start a waiting list and then get on NoWait!"}
{"text":"It is just OK. It is a really nice place. Brand new everything. It is not a place that a beer geek grew from the ground up. It is a place somebody built and hired a brewmaster. So, it is a busines venture, not a reasult of homegroen craft. 

The beer and food are just OK. The brewmaster comes from Rock Bottom and the beer is probably just about as good. We had pizza and it was pretty good. Not great. 

I wish I could say better things, but there are a ton of breweries in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't make this place a destination, but it is worth an occasional stop if it is in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"In my quest to experience all the craft breweries in the area, we decided to take an adventure across the rivers from the north hills as part of our own self-guided south hills brewery tour. First stop was Spoonwood. It was the BEST of our visits. Yeah, it's nearly 45 minutes from where we live and that means that we probably won't be back anytime soon, but wow is this a nice place!! I was surprised at what a big, new building it was! Very unusual for a startup brewery. Shows they are committed to be in it for the long term. Gotta love that. Loved the industrial vibe, the large open space, the great bar, what looked to be an awesome outside patio, and oh yes, the beer. Yeah, there's that. And it was awesome! I love that you can order a 5 oz sample for $3 and try it out. And we did. What I find though is that I want to order several \"sample\" sizes and then you end up generating quite a tab. But at least you get to sample some brew. I wish that they would just let you have a taster like some other breweries but that's nitpicking.

The Killer Diller IPA was my favorite and I ended up with a growler for later. My wife loved the Screamin Danger wheat IPA which I also thought was excellent. I'd drink either of those anytime! We got there around lunch time so it was a natural to go ahead and order food. My wife started with the beet salad which she liked - although I thought it looked a little small for $8. The wood fired pizza idea appealed to us so we got the Wake & Bake pizza. We liked it and it was enough for 2 people for lunch but it wasn't anything memorable. And for $14 it seemed a little steep in price. I like that they have a lot of options. I really came for the beer anyway and that is a solid 4 star rating! Maybe 4.5!! If I lived closer, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  Service was very good.  Our waitress was Kim.   Food is mediocre at best.  I had pulled pork, Mac n cheese and green bean casserole.  I expected a different recipe with casserole. Nope, it was definitely canned beans and soup.  Mac n cheese bland.  Pork was OK at best. Beers are not that good either. If I was eating service only I would give 4 to 5 stars.  One star for food. I'll stick with Mindful on 88.  Better beer and food."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few beers and some food with friends. During the summertime is my favorite since the patio is open. My favorite summer beer is the Orange Marmalade. The Margherita pizza is my favorite pizza there. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always very friendly"}
{"text":"I came here recently for a Yelp event. I'm glad that I came, because I never probably would have come all the way out to Bethel Park just to eat otherwise. 

We were provided a sampling of beers as well as their nachos, pretzel bites, and margarita and pepperoni pizza. I am a vegetarian so I only tried the pretzel bites and the margarita pizza. The pretzel bites were delicious - I loved the cheese dip. It was so creamy. The pizza was also very good. You could tell the ingredients were very fresh and high quality. It was also pretty thin so it wasn't all that filling. 

I would definitely return to try other options on the menu. My only complaint is that for the price, the portions are a tad small. But I loved the quality and the environment. I would definitely return it I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch out with the neighbors July 4th.  Excellent pizza - the Rolls-Royce with Prosciutto and homemade mozzarella, smoked provolone and shaved parmesan - Yum (loved the crust too), burgers and beers.  Creme brulee was actually two, served in two small ramekins (one with a delicious cherry base), plus angel food cake covered with fruit.  Nice dessert surprise.
Definitely going back for more"}
{"text":"1 star for atmosphere
1 star for beer - my homebrewing husband gave it an 'eh it's alright'
0 stars for anything else

We went to this place based off of Yelp reviews which rarely, if ever, lead us wrong. Well I guess this was the one fateful time when Yelp lead us wrong, because we were incredibly disappointed with the food at Spoonwood. The pulled pork was watery and had absolutely zero seasoning. It tasted like it came from a crock pot. The beef brisket didn't even have a smoke ring. We ordered the smoked wings as an appetizer and they were charred beyond recognition and, unlike all of the other BBQ, had smoke flavor, but way too much of it. It was like eating a piece of charcoal. Lastly we got a pizza that had pickles, small pieces of potatoes, and hot sauce on it. The crust was good but the rest of the pizza lacked flavor. Overall for spending $80 here we were extremely disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. It is seat yourself with community tables. The place gets very crowded but overall great spot."}
{"text":"Pizzas were great! Two of us split two pizzas and took home extras. Pizzas both came with pickles on them (awesome) but be warned: they're bread and butter pickles, not kosher dill :( I didn't drink but husband said beer selection was fun (but not extensive). Oreo cheesecake was silky smooth and delicious!"}
{"text":"This was not what I expected at all!  The space is HUGE!  They have plenty of room for large groups, that is for sure!  
There is an actual bar area, which was pretty crowded on a Friday afternoon.   We got a table.  My husband and I shared a flight of five beers.  We are partial to the wheat and Belgium style so we tried all of those.  I was very impressed.  We both picked our favs and ordered a pint with our lunch.
They have a great menu!  It is pretty chilly inside, so I had the lentil soup to try to warm up.  (There are huge garage style doors that they open in the warmer weather. Cant wait for that) My husband got a sandwich with different kinds of pork and bacon.  We also got the pretzel bits with cheese and mustard which were my fav!  One bad thing was the \"cheese sauce\" they served with the pretzels.  B A D  But the pretzels themselves were perfect.  
I cannot wait to go back in the spring/summer when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"Have been in Pittsburgh for 7 years - and this place has so far given me the worse dining experience so far.  At issue is not the food - it is the fact that there is no hostess and you seat yourself (\"community seating\").  Arriving diners queue up at the entrance like cattle and fight for for any table that becomes open (and there are 40 or so tables or table-like barrels).  We arrived around 6:30PM on a Saturday. My spouse was alerted by someone in the staff that a table would soon open up, and as soon as it did we sat down.  Within seconds another patron came over and started barking that he was there first and that he wanted the table. It was really hard to tell who got there first, and not wanting to start a fight, we gave him the table and left.  Really bad experience - I cannot recommend this brewery/restaurant/tasting room/whatever.  Get a hostess before you have a serious incident and someone gets hurt (or give some structure to the process of getting a table).  Sad that a simple detail like that makes it a no-go - I was hoping to do more business here."}
{"text":"Our favorite thing about this place is the outdoor patio. It's beautiful and quiet. We love the pierogie pie, and we have liked several beers on the menu. Definitely worth checking out, we will be back if not only for the outside patio!"}
{"text":"Spoonwood is one of my favorite places around.  Their drinks, food, and service are always great.  The inside has a really cool look brewery look to it.  There is also an outside patio area which is a great place to have some drinks and food in the summer.  They also have some great servers.  Jenna and Jess are two that we have often and they are always super friendly and helpful.

With respect to the drinks at Spoonwood, they have some great house brewed beers.  The Killer Diller IPA and the Cloud Trip IPA's are two of my favorites.

The food they offer is also delicious.  Sometimes the food can be an afterthought at breweries, but Spoonwood has some of the best food in the area.  Their wood fired pizzas are amazing.  I have had most of them, but my favorite is the James the Brewer pizza.  It is a version of a buffalo chicken pizza with some twists.  It comes with buffalo sauce, pulled chicken, potatoes wedges, onions, and pickles.  The flavors on this pizza come together perfectly and it has an incredible taste.  It also goes perfect with their house made ranch which is some of the best around."}
{"text":"Great brew! Very limited menu and on the somewhat pricey side, but there were unique food options and was very satisfying/ flavorful.

Modern pub atmosphere. (Not necessarily standard bar.) Great place to enjoy on a date or with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"Nice location with a big bar and an indoor and outdoor seating area. The bar tenders were friendly and attentive, despite it being packed. They had a nice beer selection and a large menu. Lots of people seemed to be ordering their pizza. We ordered the pulled pork nachos which were large enough to feed 4 people. They also have 3 bbq sauces, so make sure they offer them to you. Lastly, they serve Leona's ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"Try the smoke & Oats damd that was good, 
And the five O'clock shadowboxer 2nd best
If you like and collect cups grab some to go
How abt some great food? They got it hear also 
Hmmmm  sit in the warm sun drinking a cold beer??  they have that hear also don't believe me?
Come try yourself the smells amazing people are nice and take there time with u, can't make up yr mind just ask they will help in any way they can"}
{"text":"This place is genuinely a lot of fun. It's seat yourself, so you may risk standing and eating at the bar like we did, but the service is friendly, the beer is great, and the food was delicious. It's a really chill spot and the interior is stylish and roomy. Even though they were busy the bartender was attentive and everything was quick to get to us. Would recommend giving it a try, but would def try to get there early. Parking can be an issue too. We parked at the neighboring car wash but I would imagine in the summer that may not fly as its shared with an ice cream spot that posts private parking."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from a coworker, I decided to check out this brewery while a friend was visiting. We got there around 8p on a Friday night and only had to wait 10 minutes. The beer was good but the food was even better. I had a simple margarita pizza, and my pals had the jam burger. We were alllll delighted by our meals. The boys finished every last bite, and I ate half of my pizza which was amazing... The next day I was DEVESTATED when I realized that I forgot my pizza leftovers. I couldn't stop thinking about the pizza all weekend, so I ordered take out again on Sunday night...

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Every damn time I come here they are out of something. They took my favorite sandwich (Hog Heaven) off the menu. I never got to try the S'mores dessert from the get-go because they were always out if it. Now it's off the menu. I asked for a well done burger because I'm pregnant and cannot have undone meat! Of course the burger was pink. I had to wait and watch my husband eat his food until they brought back my meal over 10 minutes later. They've forgotten our appetizer. The list goes on every time we come here. 

Next is the seating. Community seating is cool to meet some people and have a nice chat. But it's not so cool when the table has seats reserved for their friends haven't arrived. It feels like Mean Girls 'you can't sit with us' and makes things awkward as my husband and I walk around trying to find a vacant spot."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes while multiple servers buzzed all around me but could not see me. Talked to a manager. Got a shrug from her. Two things: 1. Your beer isn't THAT great. There are two other microbreweries within 10 minutes of my house, neither of which have a prejudice against single people. 2. While I apologize for it being just me, it turns out I am a surprisingly good tipper. Not uncommon for me to leave two 20s on a $15 tab. But the asshat who ignored me will never know that. And because of the shrug, I doubt that anyone else there will either."}
{"text":"This is not a soccer friendly watch spot. We were in between sessions of a soccer event at Cool Springs and asked to watch the Chelsea / Tottenham game. It was switched and then 2 people asked to change to watch a PITT throwball game and got their wish. We had 6 in our party. Typical football mentality. Too bad because the beer and food are good"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, other food is a little off...

Beer is the main attraction and it is a great spot for 7-9 pmers"}
{"text":"Our experience here was mixed. Without a host or reservations, guests are left to find their own seats. This means wandering around and standing near a table that might be finishing up -- not the most relaxing environment.

The noise level is high; we all had to shout to be heard. I ordered the margherita pizza; it was ok. There wasn't much cheese, and it all came off whenever I took a bite. My husband had the mussels, which he said were bland. He's also been sick ever since he ate them. My friend ordered the beet salad, which was such a joke - it was so small that he ended up ordering more food. 

I was glad to see Arsenal cider on tap, but it was served in a small glass. I felt like I was being ripped off because I ordered three glasses just to make up what felt like a pint."}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab a quick drink and appetizer and did not disappoint!

The parking is a little packed and the entire restaurant is seat yourself- be patient with these two things, it is worth it. 

My boyfriend had their Killer Diller IPA and I went for their All Downhill before switching over to Arsenal's semi-sweet cider. All drinks were cold and  had unique flavors. We also ordered their pretzel bites (from Pittsburgh Pretzel Company) and beer cheese. Order this! 

For an appetizer and four drinks we paid $32 before a tip so it was very reasonable. Also, our waitress was great! She was upbeat and attentive. All in all, we will be back!"}
{"text":"4 for dinner on Saturday at 6pm.  Overall atmosphere was fun and lively. This was our first time. Admittedly, we drank no beer. This was more for the food. Basically, 2 meals were pretty good, two were not so much. Burger undercooked. Service was OK. Biggest problem was she brought out the water bottle with NO ICE--it was basically tap water on a hot day. A tad slow on cleaning up the appetizer dishes.  The appetizer was great--the Mediterranean. The back area was cool. Nice area for young kids to keep busy. Sorry, but can't recommend Spoonwood  to others"}
{"text":"We came here around 5:30 on a Saturday and the place was packed.  We found one seat at the bar and we all crowded around that.  Within seconds the bartender came over to us.  We were presented with both the beer list and the food list.  We were not interested in food as we had just eaten, but we looked it over.  The food options looked good, but I cannot comment on any of the food.  The beer selection was great and incredibly varied.  I tried 4 different beers, my husband had another selection.  We were happy with all of our beers.  They offer something for everyone.  Even though when we got there, they were busy, the service was very attentive and we were never in need of anything.  We will be back!  And we are going to have to try the food because everything looked and smelled great.  The space is open seating; so grab a seat when you see one.  The outside area also looks great; can't wait to visit when it is warmer.  Overall great service and beer!"}
{"text":"So giving it another try. I asked the waitress when they are serving food til and she didn't know. Well by the time she got back to us and tell us the kitchen close at 10:00, it was 10:02. Thanks a lot!!! Now I'm starving, way to accommodate your guests. If the waitress knew what time the kitchen closed, I wouldn't be sitting here starving, thanks spoonwood. I really wish one of you bartenders didn't always give me free beer, so I didn't have to come back."}
{"text":"Even though I'm not a huge beer drinker, I really enjoyed their \"Cold Drip City\" Coffee blonde beer. My friend who is a huge beer drinker enjoyed several pours of the \"Killer Diller\" IPA everyone else here is talking about, lol. I also liked that they had 2 Arsenal ciders on tap! 
The food was ok- granted, all we tried was the \"plain ole burger\" and the margarita pizza.  I would honestly prefer Mindful Brewing's food I think."}
{"text":"This is going to be a quick review since I only stopped in for a beer and an appetizer. I tried the wolkenhimmel hefeweizen and it was great! I don't like hoppy beers and any beer with an IBU score of 12 isn't going to be hoppy. The beer was delicious! They have a few others German style beers that I would like to try, the kounterweizen and the weizenbock, so I will be back.

For an appetizer we had the cheese and charcuterie. It's was decent, but the blue cheese was a little too much me. They have a pretty decent menu which seems like it's centered on their wood fired oven pizzas. 

The place itself is open with high ceilings and a few tables spread out. There is an outdoor seating area that looks nice for a cool evening of dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Craft brewery combined with fru fru food - I'm in!  I tried a few of their beers and the memorable beer was the Elise Saison.  Now, I typically do not like Saisons and I've tried quite a few but I sampled my husband's Saison from Spoonwood and it was delicious!  It had a slight floral aftertaste which I didn't mind at all.  Most saisons I've tried tend to be weak and remind me of miller lite but Spoonwood's definitely stood out with unique twist to a lighter style beer.  

I also had the Taffy Gruffudd Welsh Ale and it had a caramely/toffey flavor which worked well as the last beer of the night for me - dessert as a beer is what I'm talking about!  

We ordered food as well and I was somewhat surprised at the food options as they seemed a bit non-traditional for a brewery...I mean they had goat cheese people!  I had the polenta triangles as a main dish as we had shared the cheese plate as an appetizer.  I was very pleased with the polenta triangles with goat cheese and felt like it was somewhat sophisticated for a brewery but it worked.  My husband and our friend had pizzas and from what they told me they were very good.  

We didn't have too many issues with the service, once in a while we had to wave our or a random server to get a refill but we felt that the quality of beer/food made up for the fact that they weren't super attentive.  We came here on a Friday around 7:00 PM and the parking lot was packed, so much so that we had to create our own space.  

If you're in the Bethel Park suburb you should definitely check this place out.  I'm glad that I got a chance to try it out and I'm looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Originally stopped in to get gift cards for a Christmas gift. When we got inside decided to sit and grab a drink and a bite to eat. It was actually a few minutes past 9pm and when we were seated they let us know the kitchen had closed. However, the guy who seated us told us if we ordered quickly he would get the kitchen to do our order. We got chicken nachos which were good. I've been before and had their pizza. The pizza is delicious!!! This trip I also had the cinnamon arsenal cider and the maple ale. Both were good but I thought the cider was amazing! Now I need to go to arsenal cider! I'll also have to come back to spoonwood for brunch!"}
{"text":"loved the atmosphere here. it's spacious and has a great outdoor patio area. went for lunch with a group of friends and tried several different pizzas. also had the mediterranean plate as an appetizer. and the cider was great. i recommend the wake & bake pizza. it was delicious. the mediterranean plate looked a little better than it tasted. the hummus lacked flavor. but, everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"1st time there good beer selection even though I am not a huge beer drinker still tried one. Good food and service lots of good menu items will have to return to try a few dishes that stood out"}
{"text":"Beer variety is good also. Great brick oven pizzas.  Many other items and menu changes regularly. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to eating at Spoonwood for some time now. Wouldn't you know i'd be on a super restrictive eating plan when I finally got there. I have to say that I had no problems finding something suitable to eat with the help of our server and the cook.

I started out by explaining my restrictions to the server. After a few questions about drinks and cooking fat (she even went to the cooler to specifically check on the ingredients in a canned beverage), I ended up ordering the squash frittata for brunch, substituting olive oil to cook the eggs. It was delicious, if a bit small (which was a complaint that some of my friends had as well). Overall, I had a noteworthy experience, and I can't wait to return restriction free!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased with our meal last evening. The food good. The service nice and our waiter was a hoot. Nice place definitely going again."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife for dinner.  Spoonwood Brewing had been on my list of bookmarks for quite a long time but we never seemed to be able to head there.  So I was pretty stoked whenever we finally found the time although I wasn't nearly as excited about the fact that we would be arriving at 6 PM on a Saturday night.  As expected, the place was absolutely mobbed and there was a wait list which we put our name on and were quoted 20 minutes.  While we waited my wife and I checked out the space which seemed quite nice.  There is a large bar in one corner and then a massive open concept throughout the rest.  As if that wasn't enough they also have some outdoor seating on a deck which is complete with a stage.  It would ultimately take us about 30 minutes before we were seated which was weird as there were a few empty tables and they just seemed to be behind on their bussing.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I were torn between the BBQ and their pizza.  As a compromise we decided to each get an item and then to split them with each other.  So for my dinner entree I went with the pick 3 BBQ and chose hot links, pulled pork and chicken.  It came with cornbread and two sides for which we chose collard greens and Mac and cheese.  For the pizza we decided on the choke & chicken which the menu describes as pulled chicken, pesto, grilled artichoke heart, garlic ricotta, house-made mozzarella, arugula, lemon juice.  While all of that was in I also decided to sample four of their beers and went with the marmalade wheat, cold city drip, smoke & oats and killer diller.  All four of them were decent beers but it was the smoke and oats with its smoked flavor that won me over out of the bunch.  While I was still sampling the beers our food came out sans the collard greens which I didn't notice right away. During this time they had also brought BBQ sauces out and had Carolina, sweet and hot.  Out of all them the hot was my favorite but I can't say that I would buy any of them if they had been bottled.  In any case I worked my way into the BBQ first and felt somewhat unimpressed by the pulled pork.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  Next up was the hot links which actually had a great flavor to them.  My problem with them is that they wouldn't hold their shape though and fell apart whenever I cut into them making them difficult.  Last but certainly not least for the meats was the chicken.  I have to admit that this was the protein I was least looking forward to.  Boy did it surprise me as it was easily the best.  It was moist and juicy while carrying a smoky flavor that I loved.  The sides for our dish ended up being good as well with the collards being cooked until tender with some bacon while the Mac and cheesy was creamy and tasty.  Finally I tried the pizza and I can't say that I was impressed at all.  The crust had that wood fired flavor to it but something about it didn't seem right.  It wasn't crispy underneath like it should have been and I would have to say that the bottom was undercooked.  The toppings did little to impress me either and I actually left a quarter of my pizza, which if you know me, I never ever do.

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back here again in the future.  Yeah everything was ok but I didn't think it was worth the wait and the food and beer weren't worth the hype."}
{"text":"We visited Spoonwood fairly soon after it opened. The plusses - the wood fired pizza was great, and (being an IPA fan), I really enjoyed the Killer Diller IPA. However, it was somewhat confusing upon arrival, as our group wasn't sure if we were to wait to be seated or not.  It was a not. It was also a free-for-all, with regards to getting a table, as there weren't any, but we had nowhere else to go. I'll chalk that up to the \"glitches\" of a newly opened establishment, and give it another go. Again - food and beer are great!"}
{"text":"Cool place that seems like it will be even cooler in the summertime when the patio is open. I came in for pizza week. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed by the food, but to me it seems like they get the beer super right, and the food is just kinda extra. They do a good job of having an interesting menu, but I wouldn't rave about it.

We got the Reuben pizza and Mac and cheese. The pizza was probably a 3.5 and the mac and cheese was probably a 3. It had pancetta in it, but probably had like 4 bits of pancetta and the cheese was just kinda eh. 

I would give the beer and ambiance a 4 though. Nice array of TV's for games and such, but had a cool \"i could spend a whole summer day here\" type of vibe."}
{"text":"Go out for happy hour, they say, it will be fun, they say. And it sure was. 

I can't speak to the alcohol here, but the food was amazing. a large group of co workers got together one Friday night to check this place out, and I'm glad we did. 

Almost everyone got pizza. Aubrey, my one co worker decided to get the veggie burger. (She sent it back. Said it was weird) ? my pizza had pickles on it, it was the special that day. Pickles on pizza, I know, it seems inhumane. But it was right on!! Everyone was stealing slices of my pizza! Haha! 

We're headed back for round two this coming Friday, I'll be sure to update this again with a different menu item. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. Drinks are a bit pricey for small portions. Pizza was great! Had the Bianca pizza with chicken and peppers and shared it with a friend and we were satisfied. Will go back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Spoonwood for a while and finally made it here this past Friday.  While it was fairly busy when we arrived we were seated at a high-top immediately.  There were two other people at our table but they were a few seats apart and it was absolutely fine.
Great beer selection - I had both of the IPAs on tap.  My sister-in-law and I shared the pretzel bite appetizer which is served with a delicious cheese sauce.  For dinner I had the flatbread \"Rolls Royce\" pizza and it was delicious.  The crust is light and fluffy and I loved the saltiness of the prosciutto.  
I'd love to come back when the weather is a little cooler and sit outside.  This is a really cool place and a great addition to the Bethel Park area dining scene."}
{"text":"Visited friends in Pittsburgh and had a great time here! Loved the space (indoor & outdoor), service, beer, and the pizza we ordered were all good. The menu has decent variety and there should be something for everyone.

Beer: We ordered a few 2 oz samples and tried 6 different beers - the smoked beer was unreal...SO SMOKEY! I could not have drank a pint, but it was fun to sample. I prefer dark beers or citrusy IPAs and enjoyed almost all the beers I tasted. 

Would definitely go back - seems good for small or large groups."}
{"text":"I used to live in Dormont in the South Hills and I'm surprised that up until last night, I had not been to Spoonwood. I had gone to Duke's Station (for endless nights of glorious karaoke) and was pretty bummed when it had closed. But once I learned that it was being replaced by a brewery, I soon became elated that the train was gone. 

Perhaps Spoonwood feels so big because in Lawrenceville I am used to microbreweries and tasting bars, but this place is pretty massive! I saw how many cars were in the lot and was nervous about finding seats! Luckily we were able to find some at the bar. The menu seems interesting enough.

We ordered \"the heater,\" which was a pizza with hot sausage and stout caramelized onions. The pie was kind of small but I am a fan of proper portions in restaurants so I was happy to see that it was an appropriate amount for two people. Overall, the beer was good, the atmosphere was relaxed and the pizza was tasty. What's best about Spoonwood is that I now have a place to suggest to my South Hills friends for dinners in their neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Spoonwood and go often! They have great food and delicious original beers that change frequently. Love that you can get little/mini taster pours of the beer. The staff is also very kind and attentive. 

Favorites: Killer Diller IPA and any of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Guys, this place is so much fun! First walking in, you just want to stand there and take in the modern/industrial atmosphere and openness!

No matter where you sat, it didn't feel cramped. When we went, we had to seat ourselves - I believe it was a Tuesday night, but there were still a decent amount of people there! The only issue I noticed with the seating was some couples or smaller parties had to sit had the larger tables that they have, so they pretty much took up a table that seats 6-8, for 2-3, leaving some people with nowhere to sit for a little bit, but it wasn't real bad. I noticed they have a ton of outdoor seating too so that's really nice in the warmer months.

Now, when we sat down we were approached pretty quickly by a waitress, who was very funny and down to earth, so if it was your first time you didn't feel real pressured hahah (you know that feeling!). They only serve their beer, but nothing wrong with that! We ordered a beer each (obviously) and to my surprise, the menu was mostly BBQ, pizza, and burgers/sandwiches! I don't think I've encountered full on BBQ as a main dish at a brewery?!

I got the half rack of ribs with 2 sides and OH MY GOSH - it was incredible. The ribs come dry so you can choose your sauce which I liked because I always have leftovers and I'm not a HUGE BBQ sauce fan (don't judge). My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich and he said that was b-o-m-b! 

PLEASE do yourself a favor and visit Spoonwood. I can't see any reason not to. It's such a cool atmosphere and so chill! The parking lot is huge so there's no worrying about that. Get yourself out to Spoonwood!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  The pizzas are all really great (I've tried each of them on the menu!) I'm a huge fan of the \"Cold Drip City\" beer.  My friend's go-to here is the \"Smoke & Oats\" which is also a great choice.  We came here on a weeknight and there was no wait and plenty of tables to choose from for sitting.  Next on my list is to come here on a Sunday night for the Summer Concert Series! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great beer.  Great service.  Nice menu accompanied with the setting.  Come on in"}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh but now I travel for work quite a bit.  So, it's always a treat when I get to return, spend time with family, and check out their new favorite spots.  Spoonwood has a large, roomy dining area inside and out with a great vibe.  Service wasn't fast but also not terribly slow on a busy Saturday night.  My Mom and I went to enjoy a meal and catch up, so we were quite happy to hang out and enjoy the pace.

She didn't quite like her marmalade wheat beer, but I sampled it and enjoyed it.  It definitely had a strong bittersweet citrus peel aftertaste.  My cloud trip IPA was cloudy but a little less complex in flavor than other locally brewed beers offered by Insurrection or Hitchhiker.  After that I ordered a sampler of their Belgian tripel which was delicious and unique.  My guess is that the beer recipes will improve and even out as the brewery grows up.

We shared a simple, yummy salad with arugula, orange, asparagus, and some sweet black olives.  The smoked wings finished in the pizza oven are crispy, tender and almost sweet.  They serve 'em with a tangy hot sauce that'll keep you dipping back for more.  Finally, we shared the Toadstoools' Revenge pizza which is topped with a few cheeses (namely ricotta), mushrooms, and arugula.  Well cooked and delicious.  Was happy to dip the crust in the aforementioned hot sauce.

Spoonwood makes a lot of beers and offers a large and varied food menu.  I'm looking forward to returning and sampling more!"}
{"text":"This place in the South Hills of Pittsburgh is hands down the best brewery. They have so many selections to choose from. The place gets really packed be prepared to park across the street or on the side of the road. This place is very busy between the hours of 5 and 8. I've found that 8 PM hour is when people begin to depart and it is easier to find a place to park.

They have small plates of food but anything goes great with their beers. The new ones that we tried were the El Dopa, Astrid, Stunt Double, Elise and How Now and they were all very good. I preferred to the El Dopa but my wife and I both enjoyed the How Now and she doesn't like darker beers and it had a coconut flavor.

Best brewery in the south hills."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday Brunch and it was very disappointing. We all wanted to try the Pork Belly yet the waitress said they weren't serving it all day. Why is it on half the menu then? The home fries were cold and needed to be smothered in ketchup to be edible. All of our food ranged from cold to room temperature. Would not go back. Nothing worse than wasting money on less than average food. 

*The only reason it was given two stars is because the wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I wish they had better food. I had a kickass browm ale with a bland burger and a bland side of mac and cheese. Very forgettable. I may come back for drinks, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"I think today's visit was #9 or maybe even #10, but irregardless of number, I am giving one more star to my previous review, and Spoonwood now rates 5 stars in my opinion.  The last few times, I've been here, everything was wonderful.  And they even bought me, and all vets a beer on Veterans Day last year.   Today I specifically visited because of Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week, especially because my most favorite beer that I ever had here last fall, \"Beard of Bees,\" made a come-back yesterday, and I wanted to taste the new, barrel-aged version of it, and I also got here just in time to get the last two bottles that they had put up for sale also . . . YAY!
The barrel-aged \"B.O.B.\" was exceptional, and I also had brunch too, a Country Chicken Waffle Slider w/pickle, and it was all delicious.  I also bought a \"B.O.B.\" Tishirt,(really cool design (see photo)), and got a bottle of local honey from Bedillion Honey Farm, out in Avella.  The flavor is Japanese Knotweed . . . YUMM!.  Also have to mention, I had a wonderful experience with the manager, and he was so kind and helpful, so BIG KUDOS to him.  Thank you for a wonderful Sunday morning experience Spoonwood . . . CHEERS!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the last few years and Spoonwood never disappoints!  My favorite pizza is the Rolls Royce.  Prosciutto and fresh arugula on top.  We bring our kids usually, and they do have a small kids menu with the basics (grilled cheese and chicken strips).  Nice decor amd fantastic beer selections. Really great outdoor seating in summer"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always super friendly. The Killer Diller IPA is very good. Their margarita pizza is probably one of my top 3 favorite pizzas anywhere. Atmosphere is fun and lively. Previously they had no hostess which made finding a seat very awkward and challenging, which was my only previous complaint. However, now they do!

(I do not recommend the pretzels with beer cheese). Everything else we have had has been fantastic."}
{"text":"If you love brew houses then this is definitely a place you will want to frequent. Get micro brews brewed onsite paired with wooden oven pizza. It has a very casual hipster atmosphere with an industrial feel. Beer lovers will appreciate this place!  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I don't care for the physical space or the menu. Frankly, I find them both a huge disappointment; however, I have decided to remove a much harsher review for this one. Why? The head brewer deserves a chance to do his craft. I never would want to harm a person working hard and passionately at their trade. So, while I still think the space is soullessly depressing and the menu a one way ticket to yawnsville, the beers that I had were good. That is the reason to come. I'm sure the third time will be the charm."}
{"text":"Went on Friday the 13th for lunch. First time there. There was no host or hostess so we seated  ourselves. It was a bit chilly there but not uncomfortable. I like the decor but my companion(male) didn't care for it that much. With the incredible number of cars parked all along Baptist Road for people going there on the weekends, we both wondered how so many people are squeezed into the place. There did not appear to be that many tables and there isn't a ton of bar space. My companion is a craft brew aficionado and enjoyed the In The Black stout and the stylish glass in which it was served.  I just wanted a glass of ginger ale but they do not have ginger ale. I asked if they have decaffeinated hot tea and was presented with a wooden chest filled with a variety of teas -very nice. I had the hummus  with flatbread and really enjoyed it.   The only comment I have is that it was hard to recognize simply by taste the 3 types of hummus - the distinguishing olives or tomatoes are sprinkled on top - but there's not enough to mix through and get a strongly distinctive flavor. Nonetheless I enjoyed the hummus and the flatbread was excellent.  My companion had  the chili served in a pretzel bowl and thought it was excellent as well.  The service is a bit on the amateurish side however everyone was very pleasant. There was a long delay between the time my companion got his chili and when I got my hummus. I truly thought they had forgotten about me. But it was worth the wait. We will definitely go back and take others with us. I hope they get more parking! Someone is going to get hurt on Baptist Road  I fear."}
{"text":"Located where the old Duke's Station used to be, Spoonwood is a nice place to grab some food and brew! Bar and table seating available indoors. Outdoor seating also available when weather is nice. Live music usually in Thursday I believe. Parking can be a pain because it gets busy and sometimes only parking available is in the street. Staff has always been friendly. Restaurant clean and service timely. 

Food is pretty good for this setting. They've changed the menu in the last several months to keep things fresh. Pizza is delicious from the wood fire oven. I especially like he margherita pizza which is very flavorful. Pretzel bites app is not good and I don't recommend it. Pretzels seem frozen and microwaved. Husband usually gets a burger and says they are good. Sunday brunch is also offered but I've never tried it yet. Fresh craft beer on tap, local spirits , cider, mead and wine available. Right now I am loving the Cinnamon Ghoul Pumpkin Ale. I highly recommend it! 


If you haven't been here yet, check out Spoonwood Brewing soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer and food.  Lorna rivals beers I've had in Brussels, cold drip doppio, is amazing, and the turtle stout may have overtaken founders breakfast as my new favorite \"heavy\" beer.  

We ate the Heater pizza, the mussels(also better than Brussels), and a great hummus appetizer.  All excellent.  We went during happy hour on a Wednesday.  Bring a designated driver, the beer is strong!"}
{"text":"We came on a snow filled day at 5:30 thinking it would be easy to be seated. We were wrong. It was packed to the gills. As others have stated-they have no seating system, yet they have a hostess who sits there just to tell you that. They have several tables that seat 8 and most if them were filled with only one or two that had a seat or two available. So we ended up on the back side wall on stools and a wooden shelf for our food and drinks that was about 18inches wide. Here's the deal . . I don't want my view to be of a wall 18 inches in front of my face and I don't want to sit at a table with toddlers. Not a good start to the experience. 

The beer itself was decent. Nothing outstanding but nothing bad. They were out of their IPA, which I prefer but that will happen at smaller batch places. The American Strong Ale was the best of the samples that I tried. Nothing however, stood out as a \"must return to get\" beer. 
As for food we ordered a cheese platter and a pizza. The cheese platter was ok. The fruit was small shriveled grapes. The best thing on the plate was the REAL honey. The pizza was a Great Hambino. It was okay. Better than Pizza Hut but nothing memorable. 
As we were finishing a group of 13 came in and literally took over our space inch by inch with their elementary kids leading the way. Good thing we weren't trying to stay and chill and enjoy some more beer. It was very loud and we were more than ready to leave. I file this under-Been There, Done That, no need to go Back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once before but never ate the food. My sister and I went yesterday for the release of the cinnamon ghoul beer. To get a glass of the beer it was only four dollars which is really cheap then they had mini growlers you could get filled for only ten bucks. Their menu looked pretty diverse they had a lot of different options on it. I got the onion jam burger which was 15 dollars and it only came with potato chips and you couldn't substitute a side for an upcharge you had to order it separately which was stupid. 15 dollars is pricey for a burger and potato chips from a bag if they were homemade that would be more reasonable. I also got a few samples of beer the one I really like was this pale ale that was infused with coffee it was really good if I didn't get a growler of the cinnamon ghoul already I would of got that one. There also was live music playing outside which was nice. I definitely will come back to try some more of their beer and food!"}
{"text":"This place has come a long way since they first opened there doors.  Food has always been excellent and now the beers are really good too.  I'm a beer snob I will admit but Spoonwood has stepped up there game.  Definitely if your in Pittsburgh you can't go wrong Checking this place out."}
{"text":"Meh. We live nearby and always pass this on our way to various different locations. We were very intrigued when we saw them building this where Duke's station used to be. We finally had the opportunity to go when the parking lot wasn't completely filled. Being that it always seemed to busy, we assumed that it must be excellent. I am very fond of various times of beers, so I was very excited to come here. I did enjoy the IPA I ordered called \"Killer Diller\" but it wasn't something I couldn't walk into a store a find. We ordered the pretzels to start with, and they were alright, the cheese was slightly below room temperature, which wasn't that appetizing. I personally orderd the hog heaven sandwich. I was tasty, but extremely greasy, leaving one of the slices of bread completely soggy. My Boyfriend ordered the drunken turkey sandwich, which he was not impressed with. The place had good atmosphere and had pretty cool napkins, but we would have been EXTREMELY disappointed to have come here and had to have waited for an hour like most people have mentioned. Hope they improve."}
{"text":"So good!  Pizza is awesome and they have a great selection of different types of beer.  Outside looks nice, will certainly come back in the summer!"}
{"text":"I visited spoonwood with a friend after being told it would be multiple hours at another dinner spot. The atmosphere and beer at the brewery are great! 

The food leaves something to be desired. Both me and my dining companion had sandwiches which were good but the buns were burnt to the pint of distraction from the rest of the sandwich.  The menu was very nice and I am regretting getting one of the main entrees as I don't think it would have been subjected to the pizza oven of death. Thankfully we had the pretzels which were excellent and left us in a good mood (I mean in addition to the libations) or this review may be worse. I am not discouraged enough to not make the trip back from Pittsburgh. But i can't say I would recommend a sandwich here."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough amazing things about Spoonwood! If you live in the South Hills and haven't yet been here, what are you waiting for?! Aside from brewing in-house some of the best craft beer in Pittsburgh, they have a wood fired oven flown over from Italy, and some of the freshest rotating menu items depending on what's in season or, better yet, growing in their backyard garden. Start with a flight of beers and their standard pizza they've been serving up since day one, and you will walk out extremely satisfied! The restaurant is huge inside, \"seat yourself\", with tons of seating at the bar, high top & low tables throughout, and even standing room at wine barrels for when it really fills up. They have a beautiful outside area as well, with a cement patio with tons of tables, a huge yard area with some corn hole, and typically they have a live band playing outside a few days a week during the warmer months. Love the atmosphere, it's so spacious. The menu is always changing with the seasons, and the kitchen is continuously serving up something new and delicious. Never have I had a bad meal here. The staff is so wonderful, super attentive, and the service is fast. Perfect for dinner with family, drinks with a large group, kid friendly (\"Junior\" menu as well), or if you're driving through, pop into the bar for a quick beer and bite to eat. I continue to spread the good word to my South Hills friends about this amazing establishment. Getting hungry just thinking about their wood fired pizza! And their seasonal Pumpkin Ghoul beer is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We love it here. The food is always inspired & the service is great. Occasionally, it's a swing & a miss. Today our pita was burnt on one side and raw on the other. And the prosciutto on the pizza was thrown on last instead of getting crispy in the wood fired oven.  Details matter."}
{"text":"Like it here! Beers are really good, I had a white IPA, which you don't see super often, and it was great. They also have coffee-infused beer. The food is good, too! I've had the pizza before and this time they had a wonderful vegetarian entree, a white bean tartine. Oh and the space is large and super family friendly. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a beer taster of four beers and enjoyed all of them. Got the Wake and Bake pizza which had a egg in the middle which was very tasty. Layout and setting is very nice and has a play area for kids. Plan to go back when we are in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister tonight. Since a brew pub should focus on their brews I'll comment on them first. The beers are spot on fantastic. Every one of them. I've gotten flights on previous occasions and have tried them all. Each one is true to style and delicious in their own right. The folks at SpoonWood can brew.

On to this evening, I was accompanied by my sister who's in from NYC; she asked the waitress if the Islander hockey game could be shown on the TV closest to us. The waitress tried her best to find it but Direct TV simply wasn't showing it. Not SpoonWood's fault but cudos for spending the time trying to find it.

We started out with drinks. My sister is a bit of a wine connoisseur and it was nice to see that in addition to the beers that they brew, SpoonWood also has taps dedicated to wines. Won my sister over big time. I ordered a pint of the O'verMilion Irish Red Ale and a Bruna Belgium Porter... was not disappointed in the least by either.

As for the food, sis had a chopped salad and a pizza with mushrooms and onions. The salad was fresh and plentiful but the pizza, although tasty, was a bit of a disappointment being soggy in the middle. I had the Not Yo' Mamas Meatloaf sandwich and it was phenomenal! 

Over all, the food was good, the service was very good and the main attraction, the beers, are outstanding. I say it's a \"go again\" brew pub for this beer jerk."}
{"text":"This brewery is huge, industrial chic & newly built to impress. Yes, we really enjoyed this place. As often happens my husband & I chose separate IPAs as our personal favorites. He was in love with the citrusy Killer Diller IPA and I was totally surprised by Wheat IPA Screamin' Danger. I typically never enjoy wheat beers but, this one totally surprised me in the best way possible!

We ordered the Wake & Bake wood fired pizza with sausage, bacon, egg and banana peppers. I also ordered the beet, Fava bean & goat cheese salad. Both items were solid but didn't blow us away. Lunch bill was $56 for 2 beers, 2 beer samples, a pizza & a salad. They have to pay for that beautiful space somehow!

They also have a cool hands-free growler fill system that puts CO2 into the growler first to improve its storage life. 

We liked Spoonwood a lot and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have now been back a number of times and I have to say the service just gets worse and worse.  As far as I'm concerned, the food is ok, not fantastic.  We have decided that it is not worth the far less than stellar service we've received.  I have to honestly say that we have, in the dozen times we've been, had ONE really great server.  The last time we were there, we left without ordering anything after being ignored by servers walking by our table AND asking one of them if they could find our server.  Servers were cleaning tables around us, talking to other customers and talking to each other.  It must be nice to be so busy that you can afford to alienate customers."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for months so I finally did.. I'll keep it short.. 

I ate alone so this probably isn't recommended for 1 person.

3 IPA's on draft. All I drink..
Sampler of:
Killer, Forever and Forever 2.
Killer was too light for me, forever was good but I went with forever 2 because it was the best.

2 Forever Single 2's (Chinook)

Hummus Appetizer will serve 2 maybe 3 if you load up the pita's. Really good, I would happily order again. 
-Great value!

Pork wings are short ribs, 3 of them cut off the opposing bones. Juicy, flavorful with good seasoning. Not worth the $15, I'd be much happier with value getting 6 wings instead. I think really any more than 6 wouldn't make it as satisfying. That way they can be more easily shared.
-Bad value

Good Ole burger was done medium. Bacon was crispy, not burned. Soft but not undercooked. Honestly, I was surprised with it considering about half of the menu is based on the brick oven pizza that they make. I don't remember price but it wasn't glaring enough that I didn't order it having eaten lunch. 
-Good value!

Cookie dessert was good. Went well with the coffee but I would've preferred having a coffee stout to switch to. I didn't feel that it was terribly rich, too small or big. I had one of the cookies left but was happy with the closing.
-Good value

Coffee was good with the cookies.
-Good value

Overall, I would go back and try other things from the menu until I got to everything. The place was clean, no sticky table and nice bathrooms.

The waitress, Kimberly was great. She found it odd (I gathered from her reaction) that I didn't order everything at once but wasn't clingy or noticeably absent throughout. I would request her again given the chance to.

So the damage was just over $64 without tip which means $80 for any self-respecting patron..

The reasons for the 4* are:
IPA listed but unavailable. At their own brewery.
Pork wings that are $5 each.
No coffee stout. I think that it's seasonal (crazy).
Menu entrée options that aren't pizza are scarce."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh visiting from Florida, and we did some brewery hopping one of my days. Our first stop was Spoonwood and I was impressed! It was a nice atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. 

I had the coffee beer, cold drip city, and it was insanely good. I've already been googling to see how I can find it here in Florida! I also had the pork nachos, and the pierogi pizza. Both were excellent! I'm super bummed that I'm in Florida and can't visit as often as I'd like because Spoonwood has won me over!"}
{"text":"On our self guided south-side or south hills brew tour of Pittsburgh my friend and I hit up this place after the Hitchhiker brewery/pub. This place is much bigger. A little bit of a corporate feel to it. However the guy at the front is very welcoming and friendly so that was a plus. They have a wide ranging menu of all things that are great with beer - pizza, cheese, mac & cheese, pretzels, tacos, etc.  I tried the perogi pizza and I love love perogi's paired with my other favorite - pizza. Not what I thought it would be but it was tasty and helped me soak up the beers I tried from the sampler.  All interesting and yummy beers.  I wish they had a few more IPA's would be my only thing."}
{"text":"We have visited a few times and sometimes it's really good and other times it isn't. There seems to be inconsistency with the food. We have ordered the margarita pizza and Bianca each visit. Sometimes they have been absolutely delicious, other times we were really disappointed. I ordered cornbread last time. It was served cold and seemed like it was maybe store bought instead of homemade. When the food is good, it's 5 stars... but it's only been good half the time."}
{"text":"The time to go is during Happy Hour. $1 off wine, beer, white and margarita pizza. 
The place is very large, seat yourself when we were there, if you can find a table, and noisy.  Managed to get a table as we walked in that they were cleaning.  Others after us had to wait a few minutes.  Somehow our waitress knew we were there and waited on us quickly.  We had our drinks quickly and ordered two pizzas, a Margarita and the Wake & Bake which has bacon+sausage, banana pepper, fresh cracked egg, smoked provolone, mozzarella and basil.  The Margarita was pretty good, thought the sauce was a tad bitter but OK.  The pizza dough was good, a good blend of crisp and chew, a nice flavor.   Only wish they had some olive oil to dip the crust in.  The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and was good but nothing special but I would like to come back and try some other items and pizza. 
Don't forget there are some interesting beers to try, too."}
{"text":"Spoonwood has been a fairly regular spot for us while we've lived in The South Hills. Their beers are great and the newish bbq spin on the menu is a nice touch. Nothing like washing down brisket with a Working Class Hero."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table but it was totally worth it. There was a man who took our name for a table and he updated us periodically on the status. He was very nice and helpful. 

The beer descriptions are simple and to the point. Even if you don't like beer, they have a decent selection of cider, wine, meads, and liquor. I really appreciate the fact they try do everything LOCAL!!! 

Leanne was our server, she was super helpful, fast and knowledgable. She did a great job explaining and helping us pick something for dinner. I had the no meat treat pizza, it was yummy. But you will need a fork because it is packed with veggies! Not complaining :) my bf had the pulled pork sandwich and he loved it as well! I just wasn't that crazy about the Cole slaw. Don't be upset that the chips aren't made in house, they are still great! 

I wish we saved room for dessert but unfortunately we didn't make it that far, until next time!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch because all my friends raved about it. We all met up for brunch and i had the pancake, grits,  and sausage.  It was fulfilling and tasteful. This is a great environment where you can spend your whole day there. Their beers are amazing."}
{"text":"This place just gets better and better! I had 2 fish tacos, and the chef allowed me to substitute the daily special side - a summer snap pea salad w arugula and watermelon chunks for the side. Now I may not count on that, but the salad was fabulous."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good food. Great vibe. 
The seating is chaos. Our waitress was sweet, and kind but clearly overwhelmed.  
Seriously? Hire more waitresses, it costs you nothing. The reason they number tables and seat waitstaff on a rotating basis is because it works . 

Are you a brewery, bar, restaurant with a kiddie menu?  Make a choice."}
{"text":"I went during happy hour on St.Patricks Day as a party of 4, and was pleasantly surprised that there were still tables available! The atmosphere was excellent; there were lots of fun things going on (giant jenga, TV's, etc.) as well as plenty of people pretty much just hanging out and winding down.  We ordered 2 pizzas (margherita and bianca) for $7 each as a happy hour special; both were good, but the bianca was better!  We also ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and the chicken nachos.  The nachos were pretty good, definitely a good portion, but the bacon wrapped shrimp was excellent! 

As far as the drinks go, I don't care for beer, so I'm not the best judge for quality of their brewing, but those who were with me and ordered a couple different drafts really liked almost all of them. I ordered their pinot noir (which was $1 off during happy hour), and thought that it was pretty good...not the best ever, but good enough to have 4 glasses :-)

The service was excellent. We were greeted a minute after sitting down, our drinks were quickly replaced, and the food was served efficiently. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Beer is good not great. Food is okay. Pizza, a couple of sandwiches and appetizers. Menu needs some work. Service is pretty good considering how busy it has been since it opened. Hopefully they expand their menu and add alcoholic drinks at some point."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area and needed some lunch and were craving a few drinks.  We have some Yelp friends that gave this place good reviews so we had to try it out and I'm really glad that we did. 

      I did mistakenly drive past the brewery when we were looking for it.  It's big but there isn't much of a sign by the road when your driving past.  

     When you walk in it's a very nice looking brewery/restaurant.  Nice and open they way I like it.  We went right to the bar and it wasn't too busy which was nice.  Again looking around it was a great atmosphere and good place to watch a sporting event.  

     We were greeted right away from the bartender and looked at the drink menu.  They had a couple interesting wheat beers that I got to try.  One had a banana taste that was different but good.  I just couldn't drink more than one of them.  The other drink I had was their White Hot Rage.  It's a Belgian White that I did like and gives you a good kick in the after taste.  They weren't my favorite wheat beers but it was original and a good drink to go with my lunch.  Carrie did like her IPA's that they had there.  I'm not a big IPA fan so this is good for the IPA fans out there.  I know it's just water but their water jug was cool and I got like 3 of them because it was so good.  I must have been thirsty or something.

     Onto the food!  Carrie ordered their half chicken and got 2 sides and I ordered their Texas Brisket.  It basically was a burger with brisket on top and it was mouth watering.  I was really hungry and I had no problem devouring this sandwich.  It came with chips that were really good and nicely seasoned but I could have used fries or something more filling to go with this sandwich.  Regardless it was really good and I'm glad that I got it.  Carrie's chicken was good too.  The chicken breast was a little dry but still good with a little sauce.

     You will see this in the other reviews but I wish this place was closer to where we live.  My wife and I never are in this area so it's disappointing that we might not be able to come back for a while but if we are in the area we definitely will be stopping by.  

     There are a lot of breweries popping up in the Pittsburgh area but this place did it right and if your are close by stop here and give them a try!"}
{"text":"This might be my new hangout! Love the look and the beer is pretty amazing! I've had the beer at tastings in other places and was very eager to try the wood fired pizza. The pizza oven is impressive, shipped over from Italy and the pizza will only get better with age. The crust is thin and crispy, the edges done just right, not overly crisp or burnt the way some pizzas are delivered when the pizza chef forgets it only takes a minute to cook in the 800 degree ovens. We had the simple Pizza Margaret sauce, cheese and fresh basil. Perfect! The house made Mozzarella was gooey, rich and flavorful. 

I'm getting ahead of myself. For a starter we had the the hummus platter, nice and creamy, not oily and flavorful. This could have been an entire meal, after all I was only eating a slice of pizza just to experience the taste. The hummus was completely satisfying and went well with the killer diller IPA. 

I love this place and can see it as a new normal for me. Prices are reasonable and the beer is fresh and cold. Only had the Killer Diller, a smooth, bitter IPA that stands up and compliments the heavy hummus and pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great beer, great service, great entertainment and great food. While their beer menu is a little IPA heavy, they have a good lager and good wheat. I was really excited about the games and the outdoor space they offered. They have a jumbo jenga set and cornhole as well as live music on Thursdays! In addition, I highly recommend all of their food. We didn't try anything that we didn't like (pretzel bites, nachos, pizza, and sandwiches). Just note that the pizzas are really only enough for one person."}
{"text":"I went to Spoonwood Brewing for a short visit on a Saturday afternoon while visiting in Pittsburgh.  The bright silver buildings stand out as you approach the brewery on the small \"back road\".  The architecture and decor inside is simple and industrial (+1).

They offer 2 different size drafts, a 5 oz. sample or a 16 oz. glass.  I really liked this because I was able to try three different samples without drinking a full beer or something I didn't really care for.  My friend had four samples, and we also tried each others.  We each liked about 3 of the 7 we tried.  Overall, not too bad.

He had a personal pizza, it was small and looked somewhat disappointing, but it was ok for a light lunch/snack.  Their menu sounded pretty good, but if everything looks like the pizza I wouldn't recommend going to Spoonwood for the food, just the beer."}
{"text":"The brewery craze has hit Pittsburgh...and I like it. Spoonwood is a cool place with pretty ample seating and some good brew selections. I went here to support an arts event that was being featured by my high school alma mater. I had the marmalade wheat ale which was pretty tasty and also tried the dark Belgian selection. Normally I am a fan of Belgian, but that one was not my jam. 

On to the food....so-so. My mom's friend ordered the pork nachos and they were decent. What was not so decent was the margherita pizza we ordered. This thing literally had Tic-Tac sized pieces of basil on it with VERY little cheese. The sauce was also very underwhelming. 

Go here for the beer and maybe some live music if they have it, but skip the food. No bueno."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying this is not a 3 michelin star restaurant, but it is one of the best brew pubs in the country when food is taken into consideration, and we've been to a lot of them. The service is quick, the waitstaff is friendly and prompt, and best yet: the beer and food are pretty damn tasty. 

There are a wide variety of beers from the typical styles of stouts, porters, ales, and lagers to some experimental and less familiar to mainstream beer drinkers. After talking with the barkeep for a while - there is a rotation of seasonals and also session beers that they swap out when they have been exhausted so there is reason to return multiple times without the fear of the experience and taste becoming stale. Since the rotation is changing relatively frequently, it is best to visit their website to see what is on tap. 

The food is expertly paired with the beers and often includes some sort of integration from their offerings. This adds a level of complexity as well as depth to the experience as you can try to pick out the subtle notes and spices of the beer in each of the dishes. They have everything from soups to finger foods to small plates to full blown entrees, so you can find something that fits your taste as well as your appetite regardless if it is for happy hour or a big dinner. We settled on the margherita pizza, the bbq nachos, fish tacos, and a slew of pints (the Kolsch style was my favorite - hands down). 

The seating arrangement is not going to please everyone - it is first come, first serve and arranged mostly in a community style. There are plenty of spaces to stand (or sit on a stool around a literal barrel) and enjoy a drink or an appetizer, but on busy nights (Thurs-Sun) getting a table can prove to be difficult. You do not need a table to eat/nosh on their small plates - but if you are planning on a full-blown dinner then I recommend waiting for a table which requires some prowling and hovering as there is no formal wait list. 

It may be a bit difficult to get to with traffic during the weeknights, it may be difficult to get a table during the dinner rush, but to anyone in the area looking for a solid and well executed brew pub experience - you will not find another like Spoonwood in the 'Burgh (and I've been to them all). It mixes a traditional brewery feel with a more trendy and foodie restaurant and the results are remarkable. Highly recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for forever and a day (that's a LONG time, just FYI). I never usually trek out to Bethel Park, so it needed to be a special trip out yonder. You know it's a brewpub as soon as you pull up to the building. Maybe it's the massive brewing equipment, of the cute little beer glass shaped door handles, but they've got their ambiance down!

The inside has beer barrels throughout, with large garage doors opening out to a patio. It's bright, airy and clean inside. I am totally into the vibe here. Our server was so nice and was patient with accommodating questions and some special menu requests. 

I tried a taster of the smoke and oats and marmalade wheat. Both were excellent, with the smoke and oats maybe being something I'd get with a hearty dinner, but since it was a warm summertime afternoon, I went with the marmalade. Ugh, it was so good!! I could have had multiple glasses. That could have been an issue later on in the day if that would have happened!

I was excited to try out their brunch menu and ordered the Butternut Squash Scramble (Scrambled eggs | house-made sausage | roasted butternut squash | onion sprout home fries). I'm wondering if I missed the mark and should have ordered the pizza's. I mean, they do have a fancy pizza oven right outside the kitchen for all to see! 

My dish fell a little flat. It needed more flavor, and was bland. It was also pretty tiny. For around $10 you can go either way, some places you can get a hearty meal, while others are a little lighter fare. I'm not sure if the \"a la carte\" marking on the brunch menu is meant to mean \"smaller plates\" or not? I was just surprised for a brewpub because I'd tend to lean towards heartier dishes, especially if you're imbibing! 

Aside from my brunch dish, I would absolutely come back and try some pizza and of course sample my way through the beer menu... I know there are some stellar beers already, so I can't wait to try the rest!"}
{"text":"This is a great local destination. Great beer and good food. I like that it's big enough to get a seat but still welcoming and cozy. A good place to try!"}
{"text":"My service was good. The menu has a less is more philosophy.  Not a wide selection but what they do serve is prepared well. I sampled a couple beers and all were good. The facility is clean and I brought my wife and kids. We sat outside and had a nice evening.  I'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"This modern, spacious brewpub is perfect for a work lunch, dinner or happy hour pit stop. There's a welcomed variety of beer for all palates. If you're unsure just order several samples (no flights available). Food-wise, the nachos + pork are considerable, but not their best shareable...this visit's was lacking an adequate amount of beer cheese. The pretzels bites are unexpectedly fantastic. The wood-fired pizzas are also excellent and the mains/sammies include a few good standbys w/ interesting flavors and a seasonal dish or two. The additional 30 mins for happy hour on most week days is appreciated -- and the specials at that time, even more so. Service has always been great, but if you want to avoid a complete cluster try it out on a school night when parking is a non-issue. Well worth visiting, even if you don't live in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Love the beers, love the food. Beers are fun and my habit is to order the sampler. If not eating a meal, then the hummus trio is a perfect accompaniment. Otherwise try the flatbreads!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Service is great and food is always tasty. Staff is really friendly. I ordered the adult grilled cheese and it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in a long time. The drink selections are good and there seems to be a nice variety. I like that there is someone seating people instead of seat yourself now. It makes it easier to get a table. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to have Spoonwood do a tasting event for our Community.
He brought several of his brews. MEAD, which was potent, and good. Double IPA, named Good eye sniper- a superior brew. A Belgian, which was excellent- very Leffe Brun like, a German Kolsch, which was also excellent. His Black Stout was superb, expresso, and dark chocolate hints! The food pairings were also excellent. We intend on trying the physical location as well. Based on what we tried, it promises to be excellent. I will update after trying the full gastropub. This is a startup, by a local guy, Grant Scorsone. Well worth supporting and experimenting for craft beer aficionados."}
{"text":"Food is expensive for the size ! Beer is good. I feel the plating needs work. The Chorizo  App was so small and not worth the price. The pizza was great but smallish. I hate the community  seating.  Probably wont ever go back since I HATE the south hills ! NORTH  
HILLS RULES BITCHES !"}
{"text":"Accept my 4 star as two components 4-4.5 range on beer,  3-3.5 range on food. The beer selection, quality, presentation, price are all fair. This is an enjoyable place for some craft brews from a state of the art micro brew.  The food on the other hand has room for improvement, a sandwich, pizza, and appetizers later,  i'm willing to leave a low mark. Its not bad food, its just super average, for a higher price than feels fair.  Get excited about the beer, and eat dinner before you get to the parking lot. Service is friendly and prompt, the atmosphere is clean, large, and modern -German, in a way- and the crowd is wide range aged, middle- upper middle."}
{"text":"We have been very excited to try out Spoonwood since hearing about it opening up! There isn't anything like it in the South Hills -- and we love a good craft beer and pizza, so this sounded perfect!

We went around 6:30 on a Saturday night when weather was pretty bad, hoping this would make it easier to get a table. Thankfully we had read previous reviews about the lack of seating system so we were prepared. While there was a staff member seated near the front who apparently was supposed to explain the lack of system, she did not address us nor anyone else that entered. All tables and the bar were packed full. We spotted a four-top wrapping up their bill so kind of hovered over them until they left - it felt very awkward and borderline rude to have to rush their table. In fact, we had asked a server who walked past us at one point what the seating deal was, and he even joked \"You just have to get ready to tackle people to get yourself a seat!\". He also told us the long tables and wall table are \"communal\", meaning multiple parties can sit at one table, whereas the low tables (mostly four tops -- maybe 8 total) were for parties up to four.  Good to know! Maybe a sign would help clarify? Another point to note before you arrive -- as there isn't a seating system, it isn't really \"first come first serve\" as advertised. There is no list of who arrived first, so even if you've been there for 30 mins waiting for a table to open up, a faster person may beat you to that now open table who has only been there for a few mins... This is a frustrating and kind of stressful method for a patron.  You better be hyper-aware of who is getting up next and ready to pounce! If they switched to a standard seating system, that alone would change my review from 3 to 5 stars!! 

Anyway, we were able to get a seat after about 15 mins, which wasn't bad, but having to keep your eyes on who would be getting up made it hard to enjoy conversation in the mean time. Once seated, everything took a turn for the better!

We were greeted immediately and our server explained the beers and menu to us. We were disappointed they were out of their IPA, but all other beers we tasted were good. The Smoke and Oates was my favorite beer - it was really good and had a really smooth smoky taste. 

We had the hummus appetizer and the pita was fresh made and served warm, and all three types of hummus were very tasty! I had the margarita pizza and added the caramelized onions (which were excellent) and was pleasantly surprised that their pizza lived up to its hype!! The fresh house-made mozzarella was delicious!! And the crust was nice and crispy! 

Overall the beer and food were all really good - would say 5/5 for food and drink! But the nightmare seating system (or lack thereof) is what ultimately made me give this only 3 stars as it really detracts from the experience and makes me question whether I would return for dinner-time. Hoping they change that in the future!!"}
