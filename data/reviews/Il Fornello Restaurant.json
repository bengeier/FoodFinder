{"text":"Perfect place to sit outside on a breezy sunny day in summer. 
Way too touristy for my liking and the food did not met my expectations.
The place came highly recommended from the concierge at the Intercontinental but turned out to be a utter disappointment. 
I have to say that we had just one course each and maybe we should have gone safe and tried the wood fired oven pizza which is what the concierge recommended in the first place."}
{"text":"Along the shoreline of Lake Ontario is Il Fornello.  There are several locations throughout Toronto.  Don't let that fool you into thinking it's just some mediocre restaurant chain.  Il Fornello does Italian right.  So many flavors on their brick-oven pizza.  The fresh fig pizza with basil was a perfect blend of sweet and herb.  Ravioli with spicy sausage in alfredo sauce was soooo good.  Ample outdoor seating to dine and watch the boats.  Good-sized portions and nice wine selection."}
{"text":"Why is it that places like this capitalize on location while cheaping out on food?  One of the best places to be on the summer to enjoy a drink an watch the city go by. But can't we do better with the menu?  The food just plain sucks.  Grab a drink and a chair for 5-star viewing."}
{"text":"The location is lovely and probably the best thing about Ill Fornello - especially if you get an outside seat watching out onto the lake.
Waiter service was very friendly, helpful and understanding - we had a young child with us. 
I got the Chicken Alfredo and the pesto sauce was scrumptious! Plus - I was starving and I gobbled it up like a Hoover. 
They have a good choice of wine too which is great as wine and pasta is one of my favourite combos. 
Perfect for a light meal after a stroll around Downtown or Harbourfront."}
{"text":"It's not touristy when it's dark outside and you can't see the foreigners anymore!

I have a thing where I like to try Alfredo sauce dishes at different Italian places that I go to. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo here and it was absolutely divine. In fact, it was so good that Il Fornello is currently in my top three places to go eat Alfredo sauce dishes. 

The Harborfront (or \"Harbourfront\" for the Queen's bitches) is a beautiful view right outside the restaurant. 

Warning - this place is not cheap. But it's worth it. Made my second-to-last night in Toronto a memorable one."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the last time I ate at Il Fornello.  No, not the \"previous\" time, the FINAL time...last Friday night.

Yes, the food has been disappointing for years, which has drastically reduced the frequency of my visits (a man can hope), but this report relates more to customer care and service.  We arrived at this location basically by default.  We were in the area due to a traffic jam, and there's really not much choice at Queen's Quay.

We approached the inside entrance to witness a half-empty restaurant.  The hostess asked if we'd like to eat inside or out on the patio.  \"Outside, if there's room\", I said.  She directed us to the inconveniently located outside entrance.  We walked to it (not just around the corner...it's a bit of a hike) to be told that there was a 10-minute wait.  Admittedly, that's not a long wait, but how long do quoted 10-minute waits turn into 20 minute waits?  I heard someone ask the outside hostess whether there was room inside.  She said she didn't know...that they were completely separate entrances, whatever that means.  I assured the guy that the restaurant was half-empty inside.

We returned, and once seated inside, I asked to speak to the manager.  He arrived quickly, but seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else.  I politely described the situation, and asked if the hostesses couldn't somehow be in contact with each other to determine whether the other had any seating?   Did the technology not exist?  He then uttered the two phrases no customer wants to hear, \"it's never been a problem before\", and \"we'll take it into consideration\".  Ahhh, customer service at it's finest.
The food was as mediocre as ever, but I won't have to be disappointed by that again.

A footnote.  According to IF's web site, \"IL FORNELLO has also been listed in the 'Top Ten Toronto Restaurants' in the Zagat Guide since 2006.\"  Wow!  That says a lot more about Zagat than it does of Il Fornello."}
{"text":"\"We are SUPER busy whenever the weather is HOT\"

Says our waitress at a nearby table.  And there's no questioning that statement after sitting on Il Fornello's patio for a few minutes.  It's situated on the waterfront with a great view of Lake Ontario and a fresh breeze that hits you as you sit back over your meal with a glass of Stella or Sangria.  It's prime real estate in a city where lakeside dining is hard to find.  As long as you don't mind the large crowds, long waits, and blowing from a nearby boat cruise - This is a great spot to dine during the summer.

Sadly, it's not for the food.  We got a mixture of pizza's and pasta's and not everyone was impressed with the quality.  The tomato sauce was bland and the margherita & veggie pizza's paled in comparison to those had in other Italian restaurants across Toronto.   Not worth the $14 paid for each!

My highlight, however, was the FICCI pizza.  Mascarpone, Proscuitto, Figs, Arugula, and drizzled with Honey.  May sound like a disaster on paper, but definitely worth a bite.  The novelty did wear off after half the pizza though!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this restaurant location is closed :( Oh dear.

Well, this location has always been awesome. My partner and I have great experiences here because our waiter has always gone above and beyond for us--even accomodating and feeding our dog he allowed on the outside patio. He even brought us blankets and pillows, and we watched the waves sway as we dined on their delicious fig pizza and seafood pasta. The mussels were amazing--and I don't even like mussels.

In the daytime, it's great for beers and watching people rollerblade and jog by on the harbor front. In the night, it just sets such a romantic ambience on the outside patio.

Too bad it closed down!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often but had to eat today and thought...why not shy away from the oily food that is the watermark.

They have a new autumn menu that isn't bad at all.  i had the salmon pizza app (ok), lamb shanks (dry and not great...so meh) and cold tiramisu (actually surprisingly good).

Food was ok. ambience was ok (but only because it was work related).  service wasn't too bad, the manager was good!

What i learned about myself: i ain't vivek :) jk"}
{"text":"Today's business lunch was at Il Fornello in Queens Quay Terminal. Lusso (their \"sister\" resto-within-a-resto) was our first choice, but it has now closed for the season, so we went for the ol' standard. It's a good place to meet people - great casual/upscale feel, accessible and delicious food, fab service - though Lusso is quieter.

It's always a lovely and lively atmosphere, and today was no exception.
Service was quick and attentive, our server was well informed about the menu and cheerful without being annoying or seeming fake.

Two in our party of three (including me) ordered the Funghi e Rucula pizza (saut√©ed wild mushrooms, arugula, tomatoes, shaved grana padano, roasted shallot vinaigrette), while the third ordered the Fichi, which has mascarpone, warm prosciutto, figs, shaved grana padano, a drizzle of honey & lemon dressed arugula. All were very yummy and eaten quickly, the leftovers all packaged up and taken home with us. It's always a good sign when everyone wants to take what they didn't finish home!

I had a white wine spritzer which was PERFECT. A perfect spritzer is hard to find, just like a perfect martini."}
{"text":"Oh memories...................................3.5 years ago, my boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for our last dinner before he moved to Vancouver and our start to our 2 year long distance relationship.... sorry I didn't mean to share my life story here... back to the restaurant.

It was Christmas Eve and we shows up a little early, the resto was fairly packed but definitely not for long as groups of party goers came in with their smart suits and pretty dresses.

Rarely do I ever see a rose sangria so I jumped at the opportunity, but too bad it tasted too much like a red one, so I wish I had gone with the White which I never seem to be disappointed in.

Bread was served soon after with our own bottles of oil and vinegrette! I guess people have their own preferences that it is just safer to give us the whole thing haha. To start, we got a mixed greens salad, which was nicely tossed with roasted peppers, goat cheese and walnuts.

Shortly after, our main came, consiting of a Fig Pizza with Proscuitto, marscapone cheese with honey and topped with arugula. Thin crusted, it was both salty and sweet, the perfect combination and savouring every bite. The veal scalopine was delicious, as the taste just stays in your mouth as you continue to chew. I can still taste it as I write. The three large pieces of veal came with a large plate of creamed fetticine - what a hearty dinner!

And for a wonderful celebration, I had to check out the dessert menu to see if there was apple pie.........and indeed there was something \"similar\"- four fruit pie which included APPLE, rhubarb, raspberries and berries...

\"You had me at Apple.\"
\"Yes I would like Ice cream with that please\".... later coming to realize that it was a SLICE and not worth $3.00. Why can't pies just come a la mode!!!!!

The pie was absolutely fabulous though... the filling was super filled, probably pureed because every bite was filled with richness. The crust, I don't know how to explain it was super soft... didn't seem like it was baked, but in fact it was.. and the BUTTER, just so rich and delectable :)

The night was great, good company,, some good music where I shared lip syncing lyrics with another woman enjoying the tunes... the only thing was that the service was a little slow and our server seemed to be waiting the entire dining area... but I was not in a rush so lucky for her, I wasn't angry.

At the end of the night, I got pizza leftovers SWEET.

Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"I was't too impressed with Il Fornello.  We choose it for it's great location right on the Lake Ontario \"boardwalk\" but the food was befitting the tourist trap that one might expect for a waterfront restaurant.  We shared a pizza and a bowl of pasta, and neither was memorable; but the outdoor seating was nice on a temperate June afternoon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this lovely italian restaurant off of the harbour. The spaghetti bolognese was delightful along with the linguini pollo + pesto pasta. The servings of pasta were hearty and sitting on the patio was the best spot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"As a visiting New Yorker, I found this to be a pretty good restaurant and reasonably priced, considering it is right on the water with indoor and outdoor seating, comparable to the south street seaport in NYC. The salads are good and a small size is large enough for two to share. The brick oven pizza is good, as are some of the pasta dishes. The mussels appetizer is as good as it gets. Nice glass of Montepulciano and you have a nice, casual dinner for two. We shared a pizza and salad on a Friday night and they did not have a plate sharing charge."}
{"text":"I was in town for my birthday and came here with my mom for dinner. The first thing you see is that you can seat yourself which is confusing then we sat outside which was 
Nice the waitress was nice and attentive I ordered the linguine di mare which was excellent , my mom on the other hand ordered farfalle salmone which was terrible the description didn't mention sour kraut in it but there it was which gave it a bad weird  taste . For the prices they charge,  the restaurant was raggedy the lamps in the ceiling patio were burnt , the table was wobbly for $20+ a plate I expected more."}
{"text":"Il Fornello is an \"Italian\" restaurant that serves a variety of pastas, pizzas, and mains.   It isn't unique to the Harbour front, but it is one of the restaurants with the waterside patios in the Queen's Quay terminal. The food is usually better than most places, though I miss the pasta rustica. Top recommendation is The Fig pizza - it's a winner!

In terms of services, I have good things to say.  On one visit I had a random potato in my pasta, and while I wasn't overly concerned they apologized and refunded the item. Nice!

I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but the place is just too expensive for my tastes.

Any way, for tourists it is easily recommended.  And for locals, enjoy the killer patio!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Il Fornello but now I'm alittle disappointed and I don't know if it's only this location.
The menu itself it limited.
Because it's harbourfront I'm sure no one really scared for selection because this is one of the nicer restaurants on the strip of the boardwalk.

Il Fornello used to have a wider selection of pizza (2-3 page worth) - and my FAV is gone which was Brie with portobello mushrooms.  
Now it's one page of pizzas with boring toppings.

I had the mushroom pizza which was good but just bland with no sauce.
Friend had the cannolli pasta which was oven baked and he seemed to enjoy it.

Dessert was a rip off - he ordered the chocolate cannolli.  for $5 I would expect the whole thing to be filled but no - they make it seem like it's their best dessert and the cannolli isn't even filled! only piped at the ends - totally disappointing.  I had their Tartufo icecream which I always enjoy and was totally worth it. 

In all you're paying for harbourfront and I think it's one of the nicer restaurants (Stay AWAY from Watermark - absolutely terrible).

In all - beer, water, 2 entries and 2 desserts came to $56 - not the worst! 
But I still think they can do better with their menu.

Bring back my brie!! :("}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant - especially in the summer when the doors open up to a lovely waterfront patio. Sitting inside and catching a nice breeze underneath the crystal chandeliers isn't too bad either!

A wood burning oven makes good thin crust pizza (loved the fig & arugula one). Salads were a nice mix of greens but didn't offer anything particularly exciting."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for a lunch break or dinner. It's right on the Harbour Front and has a great view of the lake! They have a wide selection of pastas and pizzas and their appetizers are excellent. I hear the gnocchi is not that great but the salmon app is amazing!! In the summer they open up seating outside so you can eat right by the lake. The waiters there are a little bizarre and they don't smile, but its overall decent service."}
