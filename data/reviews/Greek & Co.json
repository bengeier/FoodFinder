{"text":"I love the food here and come weekly! However the service when ordering is terrible, really ruins the experience and if the food wasn't as good as it is I wouldn't come back. But after today's experience I think it will be my last."}
{"text":"I go here because my mom and dad take me here occasionally.  They love the atmosphere. It gives them memories and pride about their hometown. I don't think they go there for the food.  The food I would say is good, not excellent.  There have been times where I said to myself this meat on this plate is a little overcooked or dry.  I am sure they would have gave me another plate but I am the modest shy type and do not like to complain. The salads are really good..  I also have to say the waiters or waitresses will go above and beyond to make you happy.  If you like the ambiance and decor this is the place to go. If I had to go myself I would find the place too expensive for my liking."}
{"text":"Decent, reasonably priced gyro. One large hunk of fat in the pork gyro (lamb sure, but pork?). Flavourful enough, but could use more tzatziki."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but in this case, I had to.    For anyone who has ever been to Greece or ate an authentic Greek meal, you will die for this place.  The best quality meat and freshest ingredients being used here.  The guy making Gyros can't even speak english. Sooooo authentic.     Where else can you go now a days for a quick and fresh salad with a lean protein?  Really love the healthy options they have but it is beyond difficult to turn down the Greek fries (covered in Feta) or the lemon potatoes which are out of this world.    I've already been here 6 times since they opened and will be returning many times in the future.  Very happy with this addition to Queen West."}
{"text":"I dislike Greek food but this place is really nice and order is quick. they had the best schawarma I had so far, I did not like their cheese pie though...but their oven baked fries was a winner, will go again next week!"}
{"text":"Typically, this joint is a reliable go to for a night when you don't feel like cooking. I've had positive experiences previously however recently I was disappointed when I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner to go, and they didn't include tzatziki!  You can imagine it's a downer when you open up your food at home to find out the one staple sauce was omitted. Kind of a big slip up. And yes, I do usually check my food before walking out of a store, I just didn't think it was necessary to open up a container to inspect if the sauce was there or not."}
{"text":"great ambience ! But the food could be more authentic and healthy ... Just a thought ;)"}
{"text":"Check your order before leaving. I had ordered chicken Piatos, subbed rice for fries, side village greek, side of fries and a veggie wrap. I got home with a bag full of food but was extremely disappointed that they failed to include the chicken in the chicken Piatos. It was packed up as rice and coleslaw only. I called right away to complain and although they took down my name and number no one called me back. What I did bring home was just ok. Fries were particularly soggy unfortunately. I do appreciate that since my first visit they added a few more veggie options to their menu. However the price of the meals seem to reflect the cost associated with free range non-hormone meat - which I dig - not getting what I paid for however is really excruciating after a long day."}
{"text":"You'd be lying to yourself if you said this place was particularly good. It's not terrible. It's kind of like getting a sub from Subway: it's bland and boring but you've been debating what to eat for 45-minutes so you need to eat something already.  The rice is bland, the salad is bland, the potatoes are bland. The souvlaki is good but it is more expensive that the shwarma meat (which is dry).  Also, it is over priced"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and every time it's the same -- the girl working the cash should be in a horror movie. She stares at and then ignores customers with a distasteful sneer on her face like she's seen a ghost. When you finally get served, she reluctantly barks out monosyllabic questions like you're dirt under her shoe. I tried my best to be friendly and polite but she couldn't even be bothered return a \"thank you\" or a hint of a smile. She clearly hates people. I gave it 3 stars though because the food is always good, so it almost makes up for her sour face."}
{"text":"A nice addition to Queen west. No longer a need to travel to the Danforth this place is much better than the average Greek food that we have all become accustom to. The portions are very generous and priced very fair. The staff is super friendly and the decor of the restaurant is very cozy contemporary. I tried the Greek fries and chicken gyro and have since gone back and tried the beefteki (Greek hamburger) it's a must for all you burger lovers. I highly recommend you all try the food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Order:  First time: Chicken Gyro Second time: Chicken dinner, which includes: rice, 4 potatoes, coleslaw with no dressing, a lettuce based salad with minimal balsamic and minimal feta, lemon wedge, 1 pita quartered, tzatziki, and chicken shaved from the split.  My background in Greek food: I have had Greek for a very long time in many restaurants...  Ambiance: Great. Seems clean. Well lit. Seating available. The music makes making calls difficult.  Staff: Thought the staff were friendly and informative, especially when I enquired what a piata is. HOWEVER, there was no one out front the both times I came.  Cutlery: Plastic fork and knife. Served in a silver tray, with paper (waxed?) at the bottom.   General comment: No lamb from the split. Only available as a patty I think. The souvlaki is made to order, which means the wait time will be longer.  Best Greek in Toronto? No - that title still belongs to Messini's.  Chicken Gyro (~$9):  Pros: Yummy in general. Extra tzatziki on the house for gyros. Cons: Occasionally pieces of dry chicken or fat. Very little onion was given. Overpriced - almost $9 after taxes.   Chicken dinner (~$20, with extra tzatziki): (equivalent to the price of almost two lamb dinners at Jimmy the Greek!) Contrary to other reviews, as a fit GUY weighing 160lbs, I thought the serving was just appropriate, albeit I could have ate more. For $20, I thought they would give more food...Feel this is overpriced for what it gave (see chicken portion details below)  Rice: Plentiful and easy to eat (not dry). Grain is smaller compared to Jimmy the Greek. Score.  4 potato pieces: definitely on the small portion side. You'll know what I mean if you've been to Messini's.  Coleslaw: just a wee bit dry. Would be inedible without the lemon.  Lettuce Salad: Not the traditional greek salad that has peppers and stuff. Skimped out on the feta and I was given no onion (really? how much could a wee bit of onion cost...). The amount of balsamic vinegar was so little it did not affect the taste of the salad.  Lemon: I don't know if it's just me, but I thought the lemon was a little hard to squeeze, probably due to how they cut it. But essential if you want to down the coleslaw..  1 pita, quartered: The pita was absolutely wonderful - trumping the ones they serve at Messini's. It was warm & soft. Perfect texture. Score.  Chicken, shaved from the split: I compared my portion of chicken to another reviewer's portion. My portion was HALF the size. They skimped out on the chicken big time. Like the gyro, had dry pieces and the occasional piece of fat. Meat was on the dry side.  Extra tzatziki (+$1.25): I personally feel an extra side is necessary to pair with the measly portion of chicken and the pita....But excellent tzatziki nonetheless."}
{"text":"Good portions, great service, fast and delicious! And it has real Greek salad! I recommend this place especially for university of Toronto students who have very limited access to good food (I.e. Robarts cafe). Also the feta fries is to die for! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service. Satisfies pita and souvlaki craving. Would recommend to those looking for Greek or Mediterranean. Good for a quick dinner. Meals can sometimes be heavy on salt and seasoning though."}
{"text":"Yum, I had a pork gyros and a greek fries, and that hit that spot on a hungover Sunday. Fries were awesome, though I may leave the feta off next time, because fries are pretty amazing on their own. For the gyros, very flavourful, I though the meat was a bit dry - I'm  wondering if the souvlaki would have been a better choice. Oh and great service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why they're already opening up a third location!  There's a bit of seating in this casual Greek spot - several high tops and stools. The menu is simple - choose from 4 different proteins (pork, chicken, beefteki and chicken souvlaki) and 4 different formats (gyros (wrapped in a pita), piatos (open-faced), dinner platter (potatoes, rice, pita, tzatziki, tomato & side salad) and salad.  The two of us dropped by for a late afternoon snack and shared the Pork Gyro Dinner - with potatoes forno, rice, pita, tzatziki, tomatoes and side salad ($14.99) which was an incredible amount of food. The pork gyros, fresh from the vertical spit, was really, really delicious. The meat is on the fatty side but that's what keeps it wonderfully juicy and tender. The meat was seasoned well and I loved that an order had nice crispy bits mixed into it. The rice was fluffy and was much needed to offset the flavourful meat. Oh, and that tzatziki... sooo delicious!     We also shared some of the Feta Fries ($4.50). Finishing the enormous platter of fries would be a feat of its own. The fries themselves were pretty solid (although I would've liked them just a touch crispier) and they really don't skimp on the feta.   If you've got a Greek food craving, It's All GRK is sure to satisfy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, walk a few more steps and go to the O.G Grill at Walmer and Bloor where your meal will actually come with potatoes, warm pita, huge servings, and a proper salad.   The menu here is more expensive than it should be. The dinners are skimped on - standard fries and a boring salad accompany the meat. Leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Pork dinner is porky goodness, with crisp pieces and nicely rendered...great portion size...they need pork souvlaki!"}
{"text":"Tried this place one evening for take-out. I ordered the pork platter and wasn't very impressed. The pork tasted alright but it was super dry. The rice on the other hand was so watery it reminded me of risotto. The other thing that irked me was that they wouldn't let me substitute a Village salad for the Greek salad it came with.   Overall a pretty disappointing experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"These guys skimp on the portions big time. The gyro was alright at best, but what's the point when you have to spend $20 on two orders just to get a decent portion. Do yourself a favour and walk the 30 steps around the corner to O G Grill."}
{"text":"Great Greek fast food. I don't think I can ever eat Greek at a food court ever again. The Greek salad is very well done. Everything tastes fresh and is made to order. It's a welcome change from all the mediocre shawarma places that has covered this city."}
{"text":"I am a former employee at its all grk and the comment below about the staff hating their jobs is completely true.  The staff here are abused and under paid.   Dishwashers make the same amount of money as the the \"team leaders\" who are running their locations.. if theyre paid at all... as they often offer people unpaid shifts calling them an oppurtunity to learn and reassuring staff that those who volunteered there would have more knowladge and be first considered when it came time to move someone up within the company.  The expectations are higher then the wage is worth and the atnosphere is toxic. The owner (one not both) seems to get his kicks from reffering to his employees as \"fucking useless retards\" and when you point out to him that this is abuse he calls you a baby and tells you to leave if you are unhappy with how the restaraunt is managed. So leave is what i did. They delayed my last cheque and when i contacted them i was met with \"i dont return the calls of deadbeat staff who walk out when im in a meeting\".... real professional. I adressed all my concerns and i was told \"my only concern is keeping the doors open... not your feelings.\"   I worked at the bloor location but the team leader at queen did the same thing shortly after i left over \"payment complications\" and false promises that hed recieve a living wage. The staff turnover here is high... and even with a good product a buisness who exploits people like this in my opinion does not deserve their success."}
{"text":"One word. Wow. Just wow.  The food here was just incredible. And when they say authentic, it's very much something my Nanny Yaya would make, in quality and quantity!   We ordered the dinner plates, and they were massive. So much food, but it was all so good that it truly was a shame to leave anything on the plate. And the tzatziki! So much yum!  I really love the simple menu. Sixteen options in all (four meals, each with four eat options) but that's all you need. The flavours in the meal were just astounding.  The ambience was great as well. I love the big tables, and the bar facing in to the street to people watch.  Can't wait to head back (although I'm still making room in my tummy!)"}
{"text":"I'm always wary when a restaurant declares itself \"authentic\", but once in a while they surprise me and actually deliver on their promise. I prepared myself for disappointment (I haven't had authentic gyros since I visited Greece last summer). Let's just say the food was so amazing that me and my hubby (who's Greek) had perma-smiles as we inhaled each morsel.   Everything about their food screams quality: perfectly toasted pita, fresh ingredients, juicy meats, hand-cut fries, but most importantly: the best tzatziki in the city.   I hope they can maintain this quality over time!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly stingy with cucumbers. For some reason they hate giving out cucumbers and give me a really hard time about it. Once a girl literally made me wait 10 minutes while my sandwich got cold so she could call her boss and ask if she could sub cucumbers for tomatoes. I really don't understand but it's appalling and a bummer to be treated like a criminal cause I want a little cuke on my gyros."}
{"text":"Tender tasty juicy souvlaki, fries to die for and a Greek salad with a brick of really good feta with olive oil and oregano - delicious. Couldn't ask for more. We live in Greektown and this was just as good as any restaurant on the Danforth if not better. To the person who suggested that Messini's has better food, honestly if you think that's good Greek food I'm not surprised you didn't like this. Messini's is the McDonalds of Greek food on the Danforth, it's dreadful. Would highly recommend It's All Grk to everyone. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Taste: very average. Over salted and left garlic aftertaste for the whole day Its like an overpriced fast food joint which does not compare to other independent gyros joints.  Go to Messini!"}
{"text":"A great addition to Trinity Bellwoods!   With no other Greek restaurants around, I was very excited to try this place when it opened. Reasonably priced for the Gyros and the fries are so tasty. Not as comparable to Greek Town, but still one of the best Souvluki's I ever tried.   Definitely give this place a try for lunch or dinner. You won't be disappointed.   There are seats - but, this place does get busy during meal times! So, it might be best to have your meal to go!"}
{"text":"real Gyros (not the processed stuff).  A real Gem in the heart of queen W.  For those who like an authentic taste. Value is not fantastic but worth paying a little extra."}
{"text":"Let me begin.... This place is an absolute disgrace to Greek food. How hard do you think it is to put a salad together. City Greek salad is a DISGRACE to salads. It's like they gave me the shit they threw out in the garbage and tossed it in a bag and made me pay way more money than what it's worth. Screw this place... management is openly rude to employees and restaurant is lobby is gross, looks like they've never scrubbed those floors. Just a matter of time before this gross Greek place is closed. Avoid people avoid."}
{"text":"0/10 Don't ever eat here. Not a real Greek restaurant. Worst food experience I've had in the city. Me and my boyfriend stopped in for some takeout, we picked up the pork dinner and the chicken plate. We got home about 30 minutes later to find several major issues. My dinner, had PLAIN, soggy fries (not the fresh spiced Greek fries we were promised) and barely any of them at that (if I wanted plain soggy fries I would go to a McDonald's for goodness sake.) My pita and chicken were burnt to a blackened crisp. My boyfriend's \"Greek\" salad was about half a cup of lettuce shoved into a container with a few sprinkles of cheese, NO DRESSING. Not even any on the side. His actual meal was disgusting, soggy potatoes and rice smeared all over the takeout container and the smallest portion of pork I've ever seen. So awful. The tzatziki was basically just Greek yogurt, not even a hint of garlic. Not worth the 30$ it cost us. They were incredibly unapologetic on the phone when I called in to complain. If you really want a great, real Greek takeout meal (or you can dine in there as well) I suggest Astoria on the Danforth. I've never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant after being really excited to have a takeout Greek option, which advertised hormone free and free range chicken. It is now almost 48 hours since my meal and I am in recovery from a severe bout of food poisoning. I am very careful about the food I eat and I am 100 percent positive that the contamination occurred here. I was surprised that I was poisoned here as the restaurant appears to be sanitary. However upon reading a review that the food was being mishandled I am convinced this is what happened here in this instance. Unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"Nothing Greek about it, with many of the ingredients traditionally found in Greek dishes missing. Okay for a quick bite but nothing more than that."}
{"text":"Overpriced schlock. I left my wife to grab her take out after a pitiful explanation of the menu from the ill informed girl at the register and walked over to On A Bun. Rice and potatoes were garbage, chicken was ok, but $18 for one or $36 for two dinners? I'll continue driving out to the New York Cafe on Broadview even though I'm walking distance to GRK. Now that's the old school Greek restaurant they should be taking lessons from. 10 out of 10 everytime and you'll get a proper answer everytime."}
{"text":"Will never return to It's All Crap...I mean GRK  By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced when it comes to delivery. It took one hour for the food to arrive (I live in a 5 km radius from the place) and the food was cold and inedible. I spoke with one of the owners, Nathan Godin and he had the nerve to tell me that it wasn't their fault that the food was cold. umm WTF? Of course it's your fault you idiot. Learn some customer service fucktard.  There is absolutely no value in the food either. High prices for mediocre food. Go to the Danforth and there are tons of AUTHENTIC Greek places to chose from. Places that are inexpensive and delicious."}
{"text":"Dined in for lunch on a Thursday. I ordered the shaved chicken Greek plate. The chicken was well seasoned and well cooked, not overdone and the tzatziki sauce was perfect. The pita bread was fresh, warm, soft and chewy. Overall it was an excellent , savoury meal."}
{"text":"Way too pricey. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner and didn't think it was worth $19. There was barely any salad, half of the dinner was rice that was tasteless and the chicken was dry. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very good and affordable greek restaurant. A lot of authentic greek dishes, served in traditional greek plates. The place is nice as well and very well located on Queen street west. The big dishes (called Diner) are ideal for two people who want to share their food. The meat is excellent."}
{"text":"The pork gyro dinner comes with 4 slices of freshly grilled pita bread, tzatziki sauce, rice, potatoes, and salad-- this is easily enough for two people to share! A much-loved budget dinner in the Annex."}
{"text":"Meh. Sandwich board outside said to come in and try the special lentil soup. I did that, but was told they didn't have any once I waited in line. So I ordered a Gyro, which was $9. It was...mediocre. I asked for a cup of water but they didn't have any water, either. Or maybe it was cups. I'm not sure. So unforgettable I can't even properly finish this review. Won't be back, by the way.   Also: shouldn't kitchen staff wear hairnets if their mane is long enough for a pony-tail?"}
{"text":"Nice spot in Queen West.  Inside the restaurant is a small kitchen but it pumps out great dishes. I was impressed the first time that I came here.  Staff was wonderful and the portions are quite large.  I ordered the 2 chicken Slovaki sticks, fries and slaw. Yum!! It came on a silver platter and I ate every bite.   I will be back for more. Thinking about wearing stretchy pants next time. This way I can eat a little more!  Great job staff!!"}
{"text":"I've had the chicken souvlaki pita and it was really good. Pricier than messini though...  The plates look really good if you want something more filing."}
{"text":"visited on a Friday afternoon. I found the decor o.k.  which is why I give two stars. First, the food is not authentic Greek. I have no idea what it is, but it is very poor. They have beef gyro on the menu, but they do not have a vertical rotisserie for it! You cannot cook gyro on a grill. Then I ordered the chicken gyro. The meat was cut earlier and then fried on a stove before serving. Greasy, overcooked, dry, and poor tasting. Definitely one of the worst gyros I've ever had. The employee who prepared my pita had long hair, with no hairnet. She was handling the meat on the grills and making sandwiches, and she was not wearing gloves! It is very unsanitary. The employee right beside her was skewering raw chicken right beside the preparation area, which just seems dangerous!  overall, a very poor excuse for a Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in the area and got some take out.  Got the chicken souvlaki dinner.  Chicken was excellent, potatoes and rice good as well.  I really enjoyed the salad and pita bread.  I gave 5 star to this place because the food was good, atmosphere clean and friendly.  When I got home noticed no cutlery in the bag but didn't need it anyways.  Will definitely return for more Greek food when in this area too."}
{"text":"I've eaten at It's All GRK a few times now and thought I'd put it on paper.  I'm not normally the reviewer type but it's worth my time.  The atmosphere is excellent.  It a place that is up to speed with the times.  Everything is clean, fresh and well thought out.  I enjoyed my stay and was impressed by the surroundings.    When it comes to Greek food I'm not an expert by far (cause really anything with tzatziki I thought was good) but It's All GRK steps it up and delivers fresh food.  You can tell the difference between mass produced and made in house (well at least I now know this when it comes to Greek cuisine).  All in all I have to say this is an establishment worth heading too if you are out for some authentic Greek food and enjoy an up beat modern style.  Take out is good too as I've done that twice now!  Shout outs to the owners as you can clearly see the attention to the detail and I believe it'll pay off as this doesn't look to be a place that'll go \"downhill\".   Thx!"}
{"text":"Not very good service, and always have had missing items."}
{"text":"If you enjoy souvlaki that's essentially a skewer of grilled fat, this might be the place for you. Super disappointing experience all around: order a chicken souvlaki, am told they're sold out of chicken. Okay, I get the pork. I have to ask what it comes with - fine - except for the part about the French fries which you probably should mention to people.   3 minutes after I order I hear the cashier call out a chicken order. I ask and she says \"oh yeah now we have chicken ready\". Um, okay, can I have chicken then? Nope, yours is almost ready. Hm. The finished product \"to go\" was totally open, so I ask to have it fully wrapped. Sure. He jams another paper bag on top.  Would it really be that hard to wrap it fully in the foil paper so it's not dripping all over as I'm \"going\"?? Apparently.   After all that threw half out because of the giant hunks of fat. Meh. Food court Greek is totally comparable, with less attitude and a product you can actually transport \"to go\".  Won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Was in the area and starving so I thought if give it another try.  Chicken souvlaki with salad - $14 and doesn't include tzatziki?  Salad was like a whole under ripe tomato with a few cucumber chunks and oil and oregano. So if you like a greasy oregano salad this is the place for you.  Skewer was OK but $14 and no tzatziki? Pass."}
{"text":"Delicious Gyros! We ordered chicken gyros along with fries the portion is huge (can be shared ) . Excellent service excellent food .   It tasted even better than the one we had in Greece ."}
{"text":"Salads are always pretty great. Occasionally there isn't enough dressing, but the food is almost always good."}
{"text":"For a quick bite when you're hungry this place is great! Service was fast and the colleagues working when I came were friendly. I really liked their rice and even more so the next day at home when all the flavours mixed in together. I got the chicken dinner and with tax came to $18."}
{"text":"Yikes!   Pull a fry off of your pork gyro--it tastes as though it has been cooked in duck fat or some other luxurious lipid. Touch the bread--it is soft and warm. Take a huge bite of juicy tender pork (if that's the kind you bought) and taste the tzatziki sauce--it does not taste as though it was made by a machine. A strange, fresh, yogourtish taste.   The pork gyro costs $6.75 plus tax.  I went to Greece years ago. I ate many a gyro. They cost 1 or 2 euros back then. I fell in love. Later I lived in a European city crawling with gyro places that sold pseudo-gyros that cost and tasted cheap.  AND NOW, Toronto has amazing gyros of its own. Do not compare this to the dumpy shawarma joints dotted around the city. They are good, but this is different. It's great."}
{"text":"Great gyros here with a wide variety of meats to choose from.  Really love their hot sauce and the seasoned fries on top of the pita.  Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots on Queen West."}
{"text":"Good yummy Greek for a quick Greek fix. Didn't eat in so cant speak to that. Will def do take out/delivery (via dining app) again."}
{"text":"Stopped by It's All Grk to get take out. Space was nice and clean, lots of counter height tables & seating.  Ordered the chicken dinner (was hoping for lamb, but they don't offer it). It came with 3 sticks of chicken, rice, potatoes, slaw, pita and salad. It's a little over $20 but more than enough for 2 people. The chicken was very tender and moist plus the tzatziki and potatoes were very flavourful.  Food was ready in 10 minutes. The lady at cash was nice and lovely same as the lady in the open kitchen. But... and this is where they get -1 star...Pouty McGrumpy-Pants loudly checking / shaking the tip can right in front of me. Noh Tip Forrr You!  Also, -0.5 star for no lamb option  3.5 stars Decent alternative amongst the sea of sushi joints in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere. Portions are well sized and the staff is friendly. If you are in the area, try it out. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Overpriced Tasteless food. Waste of money. The portion sizes are tiny and didn't even taste good. $14 dollars for this messily chicken salad? Give me a break. Avoid this place and take the subway to Greektown."}
{"text":"Meh. Was pretty excited when this popped up on hurrier bc good Greek is hard to find in my area.  Had the veg gyro, potatoes and village salad.   Veg gyro was decent. The fries on it were great. It was pretty carb heavy but i liked it.  Potatoes were bland as all band. No salt. No acid (no signature lemony flavour you expect from Greek taters). Village salad was fine. Overpriced and what I expected. Not dressed or only dressed with flavourless oil. Needed red wine vinegar or lemon.  Certainly not quality or authentic but edible takeout.  Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"I have walked by It's all Grk on Bloor so many times but never went in so today I wanted to change that. The decor and atmosphere caught my eye right away. I loved the modern twist with traditional Greek food packages adorning the walls.   I talked with the cashier for a bit and she was so nice! My only qualm was that the debit machine was broken so I had to go a bit out of my way to get cash, but that wasn't really too big of a problem.  I ordered the chicken plate to go, and it was ready under 5 min which was great. The plate came with chicken, pita, coleslaw and fries. At first I though the price was a little bit steep at 13$ but when I saw how much food it actually was, the price was worth it.   The meal itself was very good! I wasn't used to having coleslaw with greek food as I was expecting a greek salad or olives but I still enjoyed it.   Over all I would go back to try what else they have!  Yum."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The food was very fresh, great portions and the restaurant was neat and clean.   I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner + some kalamata olives to boot (I need that briny taste in my life). I was first surprised by the large portion, but impressed at how neatly everything was laid out in the platter (see pic).   The chicken was slightly overcooked but that did not stop me from finishing it, it also had a nice crust on it. The tzatziki (yogurt, cucumber, salt, lemon, olive oil) was thick, pungent and garlicky strong, I just made that word up. Rice was fluffy, moist and the potatoes were delicious.  Overall I was impressed and I would go back to try some of the other menu items such as the Beefteki, chicken and pork, I especially want to go back to grab a gyro to go!  Also for the record my mate ordered fries and I didn't and they looked very well cooked.   The end."}
{"text":"Finally tried out this new place on Queen. I almost can't believe Bellwoods Bar & Grill used to be here! The atmosphere is very nice, great decor, clean and simple. The staff are very friendly.   I like that they kept the menu very streamlined and simple. I ordered a Chicken Salad. The presentation was very nice, with a generous portion of both chicken and feta. It was a bit heavy on the tomato, but that's just preference, and overall was pretty tasty.  The price is a few bucks over standard Shawarma places (my salad was $12.42 taxes in), but I'd say worth it considering the quality and freshness. A much needed addition to the Bellwoods strip. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I waited so long to go to It's All Grk but no matter that wait or why, it was worth it.  The customer service I find to be fantastic and the food is just as good. I am in mad love with the Beef Gyro. There is no need for a side of fries because Fries are already in it!  If you're shopping along Queen West and get a hankering for something that will line your belly, I would highly suggest checking out It's all Grk.   The Price can be a bit steep but for the quantity and the quality of food you get, I feel it's worth it."}
{"text":"Service is good, location is great.  The food isn't amazing but better Greek food of the city.  Have tried almost all on their menu, they may want to expand a bit with things on the more delicate side.  A bit hard with the baby, but doable."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork Gyro. There were some really fatty pieces of bacon hidden in there which was unexpectedly good. Meat was a bit dry but the tzatziki sauce was on par. It was interesting how they put fries inside. Would come back again for this. Good portion for dinner. Anymore I would have been uncomfortably full."}
{"text":"Decent fairly new ish Gyro plate in the heart of the annex. Clean place with nice modern decor and very attentive service. I was in a hurry and got a pork gyro dinner to go. It came with two pitas, coleslaw fries and a decent helping of that other white meat. All this for 9.99 plus tax ...   The only negative was the lack of tzaziki... There was none anywhere in my platter and none in the bag.aybe you have to ask for it?"}
{"text":"I Ordered take out from It's All GRK last night.   We had:  3 orders of large greek salad with chicken souvlaki. The salad was vey fresh and O loved that the olives were pitted. I would have liked more lemon in my dressing as it seemed to just be dressed in just olive oil and some herbs.  The souvlaki was delicious, 2 good sized skewers of chicken. I love that the meat is organic.   I didn't love that the pita and tzatziki were a-la-cart, but it was just an extra $3/order, so not a big deal.  I wil definitely return to It's All GRK and recommend it to anybody looking for a healthy, filling meal!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up across the street from me! My new go-to. Chicken is delicious, amazing service, nice and clean. Get the spicy feta- so good!"}
{"text":"If you'd like to pay $11 for a small pile of iceberg lettuce with four olives, a sprinkle of feta and four slices of cuke/tomato, knock yourself out, you won't see us here. The gyros was super gross too. At least the girl working the cash register was... oh wait, she was super bitchy too. So much for trying out the new place that replaced Starbucks. I wonder what the space will be next week?"}
{"text":"I normally go to the on on Bloor Street West, have been many times and always a good experience, with food / customer service. Last night, I walked into the one on Queen St west, the guy working the cash was busy with something, so I waited and don't mind waiting at all but not once did he acknowledge my existence, say something like I'll be with you in a minute, or even make eye contact...it was only 5-6 mins, but that's an eternity considering he was standing right in front of me the whole time. So I just said out loud \"screw this, I'd rather be hungry\" and walked out...."}
{"text":"Terrific chicken gyro, potatoes, and side dishes. Will definitely be back.  Price was just fine for this part of the city. Haven't had better Greek in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to come here after coming back from Greece and hearing it was like actual greek food.  FAILLLLLL. I ordered their pork salad and the pork was filled with fat bits and dry.  The salad itself was like greece with no lettuce, but it was just wasn't that fresh.  I guess you can't compare because the tomatoes in greece taste like legit fruits and the texture is just different as well.  I also ordered a chicken souvlaki stick and it comes with some fries under it.  The chicken was pretty good but the fries were over cooked and too hard for my liking.  Also, my friends got the feta fries which everyone was SO excited for but again a fail.  The portion is big but the fries suck and they skimp out on the feta big time.   So because i'm fat and we sat there long enough, I ended up getting a chicken gyro as well.  I gotta say that this was actually good and comparable to ones I had in Greece. it's huge, the chicken was SUPER moist, and the pita was soft.  I would come here again just to eat the gyros but it's not worth the price to come here to eat anything else."}
{"text":"It's All GR8! A little pricey but good portions and quality ingredients. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a good greek resto in the west end and happier still to discover that it's damn good!  I had the pork gyro with a side of grk fries. So so good.  I went off-peak hours and did not have any problem getting a seat. The vibe of the place was great,  modern with a greek twist."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food!!! Wow. I have NEVER had an authentic gyro and Tzaziki outside of Greece. This is it! Here in my own back yard. All of Danforth does not have it. They should come here and see what he has done. This is the future boys and girls. Truly delicious. Fresh ingredients. Locally sourced and 100% grass fed need and free range chicken!!! Are you kidding me!?!! Perfect. Design is also very cool. Pearl Jam and other cool music. They have figured it out. Well done!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened...just went there on Friday and I must say I was disappointed. I understand evolving your menu but I don't agree with compromising the quality...  So I got the chicken Piatos plate which comes with veggies, fries, pita and shredded chicken...the veggies were gross...dry cabbage...chicken was alright - fries were good...I just wasn't that impressed..it was ok. That's it.  Service is always friendly - but I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Spent like 10 bucks for a bad salad... not a place to go."}
{"text":"Not bad just a little over priced $$$ if you want a souvlaki dinner its going to run you around $16 :(  the chicken plate is pretty good, the pork plate is good as well just some pieces are a little fatty. Overall food is good would like the price of the souvlaki dinner to come down."}
{"text":"Meh! - They don't care so I won't either.  Ordered the chicken Greek salad and a pork gyro with a Greek salad on the side.  The meat was beyond dry and overcooked, maybe that was because I carted it 30 minutes before I ate it, but most likely it didn't keep cooking itself why I was walking.   However , there was no salad dressing on either salad apart from some... Delicious... Dried oregano and not a single side of tzatziki to help wash down the jerky, I mean chicken... Isn't that like 90% of what takeout Greek food is all about? So I called them just to see if they cared. I said \"hey I am kind of disappointed being my first time here and I got no dressing on my salad and no tzatziki\" she said you don't get tzatziki unless you ask, and I could tell from her tone she didn't believe me about the dressing. She didn't believe me or care....  This day in age restaurants say people complain online and don't give them a chance to fix a situation first. Well it's grk, I called you... I'm going to go put dressing on my salad now, well probably more dressing as you seemed pretty sure it was already dressed, maybe I don't know what salad dressing is, its chocolate sauce based right?"}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic Greek experience? Unfortunately, you've come to the wrong place .   The Dinners?  Where to start? The chicken seemed frozen and was an odd rectangular shape, almost like a Mcrib. The salad was not fresh at all, it belonged in the garbage. The rice and potatoes were ok but at $18 this meal will leave your wallet in the same state of affairs as the Greek economy. Don't get this.  Much better value is the gyros.... but like the Parthenon their glory lies firmly in the past . What was once a reasonable portion has been effectively reduced to what is more aptly named 'sauce in a pita'. On my last two visits there was almost no meat.   I should've known they would be cutting so many corners when the didn't spring to pay for the vowels in the sign. Certainly my repeat visits have been a Sisyphean ordeal.  Overall experience - A Greek tragedy of the highest order."}
{"text":"Upon entry, I was warmly greeted by the staff at cash. I arrived a little after they had just opened, so the place was still quite empty as the lunch crowd had yet to flood into the place. I ordered the Chicken Piatos which comes with a side of crispy fries, slaw, pita, and tzatziki sauce. Fair warning though, the portion is quite large! Possibly enough to share between two people. The fries were nice and crispy. The slaw was very fresh - I enjoyed every bite of it! I was kind of disappointed by the chicken though as it was a little on the dry side. The chicken was nicely seasoned but it definitely lacked that wow factor I was really hoping for - or maybe I just had too high of an expectation lol. But if you eat it with the tzatziki sauce and pita combined, the flavour combo was delicious! The place started to pick up as I was about to leave (around noon), so it definitely is a popular hit in this end of the neighbourhood if you are looking for some greek food. I'd definitely come back and give this place another go if I ever find myself in this area again in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local restaurant. I picked up a chicken souvlaki gyro tonight, it was the best I've had since visiting Greece. I'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good! I CRAVED their gyros and Greek salads and tzatziki - delicious. Now? I ordered this same order and received basically a bowl full of cucumbers, way less feta than usual, and NO OLIVES! No olives in a Greek salad? I don't think so!  Gyro was basically just soggy veggies wrapped up, nothing special. High price for a very simple wrap.  Having no olives in my Greek salad was the most depressing part. This used to be the spot for excellent Greek takeout, but I'll have to find another! :("}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place so decided to give it a try.  Glad I did the food was so yummy and the staff very nice.  I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late Sunday afternoon lunch.  Finally found an authentic Greek salad, was amazing!!  Had the pork meat on a plate instead of the gyro,  great balance of juicy and crispy pieces that tasted awesome!!  Friendly staff as well.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've come back here. It's over priced and the service is very slow. The music is too loud, and there are not enough food options."}
{"text":"Such mixed feelings!    The quality was great. The quantity for me was a little light. That being said, I'm a big guy, so it might be enough for someone else.   The meat and cheese was well seasoned, but the chicken was a tad on the oily side.    My village salad with extra chicken was delish. My girlfriend didn't love the seasoning on her rice and potatoes, but I thought it added a little depth over regular Greek potatoes.    If I had to choose, I'd still head up to the Danforth.  But this is a decent local/more expensive alternative.    Oh, and the really poor quality plastic cutlery wasn't the best touch."}
{"text":"So I stopped in here whiles I was on Queen West tonight. The went in placed my order for a chicken dinner. The price was 18.00. I thought it was a bit pricey. But, I got my food and went home. I didn't wait for much longer than 5 mins. When I got home, I was opened my food and was happy. The serving sizes were good (except the chicken was a bit on the small side). The salad was fresh. Greek food has never been a very flavourful type of food to me, but I was happy with this dinner tonight. The price could be a bit better.... Maybe $15 would be perfect. (Including tax)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is where the Bellwoods Restaurant (Tom) used to be.  The place is clean and the food is good and reasonably priced.  I've eaten at It's All GRK and done takeout several times and it's been good every time.  The prices are slightly above average if you're used to Swarma or Gyros on the Danforth but it's all good and worth it IMO.  The Souvlaki on a Pita is excellent, the Tzatzki is nice and garlicy.  It's a bit different - they add GRK fries to the actual Pita.  Same for the Gyros and although I'm not a huge fan of Gyros normally, these are pretty darn good!  I would recommend this place for fast Greek food with lots of flavour."}
{"text":"I love it's all GRK. Portions are massive. I usually share a chicken dinner with my gf and we are both full. 5/5 stars"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots in the area. It's great! Always fresh, always hot. It's one of the few spots in the area where you can eat for under $15. I eat here and Wilbur at least once a week. If I'm hungry I get the dinner, if I'm wanting to be healthy I get the village salad with some meat added. Definitely a worthy lunch spot. Or quick dinner."}
{"text":"foodora come through again  .. ordered 2 pork dinners .. pork was barely edible  because too much salt .. would have preferred to get greek salad instead of slaw .. fries and pita were best of the dinner .. only got one napkin with order"}
{"text":"Really big portions for a good price! Would definitely come back again. Better than most Greek takeout spots."}
{"text":"I was so excited for a Greek place to open in this area, but found it very disappointing. The chicken souvlaki dinner plate I got was not worth the price. The chicken was dry and the potatoes were bland. The salad was the only decent part.  They also refused to give me a glass of tap water! \"Oh , we don't have that,\" the server told me.  You don't have a sink?! She basically forced me to buy a bottle of water.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's pretty good! I've had the chicken souvlaki gyros a number of times, and it has always been really delicious. I was a bit put-off by the idea of having french fries in a pita at first, but I have learned to stop worrying and love it instead.  The tzatziki is very tasty here! And I like the general ambience of the place, it's a very good spot for a quick lunch or dinner break if you're working in the area."}
{"text":"Best souvlakia I've had outside of Greece/Cyprus. I preferred the souvlaki plate to the chicken gyro which was a little bland.   Some people seem weirded out by the fries in the gyro but this is pretty common in Greece (and also delicious!)  Proper pites! Very good.  The tzaziki could be garlickier but I did have an after lunch meeting so maybe it's best that it wasn't.   Not fast food as they cook to order so we did wait a while but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Solid Greek joint in the west end.  Now let's get this out of the way, I'm from the east end so I am spoiled by fantastic Greek food.  This place isn't as good but damn it's mighty good non the less.  The portions for the dinners can feed a starving family of two, it's HUGE!!  The service was top notch and friendly.  If you haven't been check it out now!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to visit this place for the past two years as ive passed by the Queen St locations many times. Seeing as this location was bigger and had more seating options I decided to pop in today. Upon entering the place looked very clean they had some high top tables, low tops and seating against the store window. Prices are fairly expensive. I decided to go for the chicken plate which came with fries, pita, slaw and shredded chicken. I had hoped that it was just a chicken breast as u dont see many greek places with shredded chicken off the pit. Reminded me alot of a shwarma joint. I am not a fan of slaw so i asked for extra fries which they were happy to accomodate. The plate plus a drink came out to $15. When i received my meal it came on a tray and you were able to grab mini hot sauce containers which i thought was a nice touch. The fries were fresh, pita was delicious but the chicken could use some work. I ate everything but the chickwn which was disappointing. It didnt really taste greek and I had wished I had gotten the souvlaki instead for $1.50 more. I would probably go back but definitely not for the shredded chicken. I would be interested in trying the dinner with rice and potatoes however its $18 which seems a little deep. I could get a better valued meal at jimmy the greek for $11.   Glad I went but i wont be rushing back."}
{"text":"Inoffensive Greek joint on Queen West. It has more of a modern feel than the more authentic Greek places that you would find on the Danforth.  There's nothing wrong with this place, but there's nothing too exceptional about it either. Oh wait! They put fries inside their gyros, which I'm a big fan of. It's pretty good, it fills you up, and it won't kill your wallet."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. I was looking for lamb, however, they didn't offer it yet. There were plenty of other choices but that's not what I wanted. Instead I went with some kind of beef gyro that was basically two very dry, tasteless hamburger patties."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to my first yelp review.  I plan on reviewing some local spots for quick, relatively cheap (up to $15 or so) pick-up food because I'm tired of doing dishes.   Where I went:  Today I decided to visit It's All GRK, which has been around a little over a year in it's Queen St. W location.    What I Purchased and Why  I opted for the Pork Piato (PP) that registered in at $9.99 plus tax.  I had been to It's All Grk in the past and I have had the Gyro (not quite filling enough for my hunger level today), and the Dinner (which is a whole lot of food), so I thought the PP would be a nice happy medium in terms of food quantity and price.  What I Thought  According to the internet piato means \"dish\" or \"plate\" in Greek, but I'm going to redefine it as \"really salty meat and fries with not-too-fresh cabbage\", because that is what I got.  Granted, the accompanying tzatziki and pita slices were pretty tasty.  I was a bit disappointed to find that the red onion and tomato that are advertised online as being part of the PP were missing in action.  These missing tastes and colours would have been welcome contrasts to a rather dull meal.  Was it filling?  Yes  Would I get it again?  No more PP for me."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken plate which was nice and very authentic. The fries were a tad undercooked which at first I thought was just my plate but so were my friends. It's located next to Trinity Bellwoods so it's a great place to stop by after a stroll and a visit to Nadege. The price is decent and I would try it again if in the area."}
{"text":"Greek fries. Extra fetta. This place is great for a mid day snack or an enormous meal. Whatever you order it's probably going to be really good"}
{"text":"20 bucks for chicken souvlaki, it's good... The price ain't! Service can be slow, the food is very good. Expensive to eat out!"}
{"text":"I personally found it a pricey considering the plate was not much food and the chicken pita isn't much to fill a guy. Beautiful place and staff was friendly just not worth it for the price it's at, Wilbur is across the street and is the best choice for food in the city for a great value."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have had in this spot. The queen west location is so much better and friendlier. I have never seen such poor customer service in my life. I'm hoping this location does not survive as the one right down the street is far better and much friendlier. I absolutely do not recommend this place STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is cute, well-light and very welcoming. Don't fret! It doesn't have that unfriendly douchey hipster vibe to it at all like most new hip and modern places. The staff here are great (some of the cashiers anyways).  For the price and quality of these gyros, they do not compete with Messini's. My friend bought the gyro once and it was really yummy, but for the price, meh.  Aside from the gyros, I really loved their dinner platter! I chose the pork dinner platter and my friend ordered the pork village salad. The platter is hefty and loaded with so much food! Super fresh and tasty! I got the Pork dinner platter and a bottle of some nifty sparkling Italian water. My friend got the pork village salad, it was kinda small but it was half the price of the platter.  Overall, cute little place for some good Greek food and if you're around the area, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food is great and most of the staff is really nice, I go there all the time. Came in today and the girl the was in the kitchen was extremely rude. I got a salad and asked to put the chicken on the side since I'm getting it to go and I didn't want it to be greasy and soggy but apparently that was sometime she couldn't do. After giving me the stink eye she walked away like I was in the wrong. Really gross behaviour and really bad service."}
{"text":"Went here because the line at Wilbur was long (as usual because Wilbur is amazing). Food was average...as good as food court quality. Staff was rude af. Beyond being rude, it took us 3 tries for them to get the correct order. Nothing complicated or modified just simply off their popular menu items and they still couldn't get it right. I don't usually review but no business should act entitled to your money. I wish I could get my hard earned $50 back. It was wasted on your establishment. Never again. Pay attention to the other poor reviews. Stay away and go to Wilbur instead."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place after a long day of moving. We ordered a chicken dinner and a souvlaki dinner. I was starving by the time the food came so anything should have tasted good to me right? I took a bite in to the souvlaki stick and the meat was really tough and super dry. They ran out of potatoes so they gave us fries. The fries were just meh and didn't have enough seasoning. The rice and salad were the best part of the meal which saved it to get two stars in the end.   Tip: If you are getting takeout do ask them to give cutlery and napkins. We did not get any and it was quite some work to dig out our cutlery from all the packed boxes!"}
{"text":"Hmm yeah. Pass.  I got the chicken souvlaki dinner; rice, roasted potatoes, 3 skewers of chicken, grilled pita, tomato salad, grated cabbage (?!) and a slice of lemon. Also comes with a small side Greek salad;   - Chicken super dry. Little flavour. Very bland.  Super duper dry. Thank god I bought an extra tzeki. It really needs sauce!!!!  - Rice? Cooked in chicken broth. Absolutely nothing fancy - Roasted potatoes,  - grated plan cabbage that made me choke, and a parsley tomato salad that had no flavour :( The pita seemed fresh. What else can I say about a piece of flat bread.  It's expensive.  And the food is average at best.  The meat was not good.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. I Have been hearing amazing things about this place since they opened the queen street location. This is the  best Greek food I have had in Toronto. Highly recommend this place to all my fellow foodies!!!"}
{"text":"Good: Chicken Gyro Beeftiki  Ok: Chicken Souvlaki  This is pure \"I need a relatively healthy dinner ASAP\" emergency food.  The dinners are expensive. Pointless, unless you're looking for serious carbs (rice + potatoes)"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from It's All GRK. I was very excited to see that a much needed greek restaurant was coming to the neighbourhood. I've ordered takeout a handful of times and every time feel like I've overpaid for bland, under-spiced food. Simple changes like adding more lemon and spices to the salads and meats would make a world of difference to their food. Bravo for trying but it's not winning any taste awards in my books."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good solid greek food. The pork and beef are great options. And the fries are really good. Staff are always friendly and helpful. I love the smaller platter that comes with pita, cloeslaw and fries. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"We noticed \"It's All Grk\" setting up to open over the past few weeks and we've been very excited to try it out. First impressions were great. The place is squeaky clean and has nice decor. The girl who took our order was friendly and helpful, and we quickly decided on the chicken souvlaki platter and a small village salad to share between us. The platter came with 3 juicy souvlaki sticks, rice, pita, potatoes, veggies, and tzatziki, and the salad had lots of fresh veggies and feta. Everything was fresh, delicious, and flavorful. Window seats were ideal for people watching.  The only thing that would make it better would be glasses and a way to get tap water (we asked and they didn't have any).   Other than that, this place is such a great addition to the Annex. Check it out ASAP."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what I got. The souvlaki wrap was short on meat and a little dry."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only ever eaten the chicken souvlaki gyro, and I've only been here at times when I've been really, really hungry. That being said, I really enjoy the food here. It is always fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Situated on Bloor St. close to Varsity Stadium I decided to give this place a try for some takeout food. They serve up Gyros, and a few sides. Basically chicken and beef is carved from a large piece of breast and dark meat rotating on a vertical electric grill and served with salad and fries and pita bread. I really had expected the chicken to be wrapped in the pita but everything was loose.  I ordered a chicken gyro dinner and it came with salad and fries. The chicken was dry and not so tender. I expected more for the $15.00 I paid. I may have also been put off with the absence of gravy to go along side my fries.   All in all I don't think I'd go back. It may have been late in the day or the 10 mins it took for me to get to my destination and eat my dinner however my experience was not great. If I had to try them again I would definitely eat in and see how that affects the taste of the food."}
{"text":"I've had food here before - the food is really good and the decor is amazing.  Came here for a really quick bite before a date at 7PM. Ordered a souvlaki stick at around 6:40PM. There were only two other people in the restaurant. The service was super slow, and by 6:57 still didn't have my souvlaki stick. Really shouldn't have taken that long - I left without my food in fear of being late for my date."}
{"text":"A newly opened restaurant. I ordered the chicken plate. The Chicken was extremely dry and the plate lacks flavour in general. It was pretty busy for a weekday night and lot of people were taking out. I complained about the chicken and was immediately given another side of chicken. It was still very dry and all had very thick \"crust\" from maybe sitting on the grill for too long."}
{"text":"recently started working in the area and have tried both this place and Original Gyro around the corner on Walmer.    Original Gyro wins hands down on every level.  Better value, quality, portion size, flavour, wait time and customer service.    Don't waste your time or money here unless you like dry meat with several fatty pieces heavily seasoned with oregano in your gyro.  ick.   2 stars for the decor and tzatziki only."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a dental appointment and I walked by It's All Grk. It's like a Greek eatery for the young and hip. The dining area has high chairs only; my 4'11 mum had difficulty sitting on the high chairs so she ended up just standing beside me. I really like the look of this place; it's modern chic unlike some of the places on the Danforth that have an outdated look. The food was nothing to write home about considering the price. I ordered the spanokopita (sp?) for $5; it was so greasy that I threw it out after a few bites (I can HANDLE greasy food too!). The chicken gyro was large, but extremely dry. Anyway, if I want a gyro wrap, I don't think that I'll take the trip to the Annex for it.  Good for: Greek food"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab lunch on Queen West on a nice Saturday afternoon. I went to their other location at Bloor/Spadina (food was mediocre) so I was hesitant to return to GRK. I had the chicken gyros wrap; they put fries in the wrap, which is pretty cool. As others have mentioned, in spite of ordering O N E wrap, it's quite large so you fill up quickly. The food is a-ok. If I want Greek food and I'm in the area, I'll definitely drop by; however, I have a long list of 'go to' places for gyros that's not It's All GRK.  Good for: Greek"}
{"text":"Hits the mark for me! Quick and dirty Greek food, a bit pricey but tasty and does the job. Service is a bit slow. Re: a review below about water, the server did give us two cups of tap water when I asked.  Chicken Pita 3.5/5 - generous portion, toppings were good but the chicken lacked flavour  Greek Fries 4.5/5 - excellent! fries were fresh, cooked well and the feta cheese definitely makes it quite unqiue   I'd come again."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while. I've seen a very tasty picture on instagram of a chicken gyros wrap from this place. I decided to make the trip to queen Street west to see for my self. I got the chicken gyros wrap as planned which was very underwhelming. First, it was over priced compared to other Greek restaurants serving gyros wraps. Second, I was very underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I prefer mesini much more over this place."}
{"text":"We ordered uber eats: Pork plate (which came w fries, a pita, and coleslaw) it was a good portion.  However, the Greek salad with a chicken kebab seemed more like a side salad then enough for a meal (it was an inch down from the top of the container) but the flavor was great, a little heavy on the dressing.    $37 later... NOT worth it, especially the salad. I ended up having to eat some of my BFs."}
{"text":"I had a really awful experience here but it seems that it may be an outlier. Came in to a cashier completely berating a customer and ended up receiving an order different than the one that I made. I left since I didn't want to make a scene, but basically the cashier refused to refire my order (chicken instead of pork souvlaki) and told me I was SOL. Pork was overly greasy and food was lacklustre."}
{"text":"Went there with coworkers for lunch.    Food: I got Pork Piatos.  It tasted good, but nothing special.  The portion was large, it ended up filling me.  Others got the Gyros, and were happy with the size and the taste. The cost for the Pork Piatos was just over 10$  Locale: The place look like a fast food joint, has a 2 large tables (6 ppl. each) and 3 small tables (2 ppl each).  You order and pick up food at the counter."}
{"text":"Order food for takeout via an app.  It was ready when I got there.  I got a chicken plate for $13.55 with tax. (see picture) It came with some coleslaw, a generous amount of french fries, a healthy portion of chicken, 1 pita bread (cut into 4 pieces) and a small container with Tzatziki sauce.   The food was tasty, but on the expensive side for what you get."}
{"text":"This place has been in my neighborhood for a while now and this is my first time here.  I am very impressed so far.  I love the design and overall atmosphere, the Edison lights with bright cords are funky and industrial.  The food is very high quality and great portions.  I got a chicken plate and they let me substitute potatoes for fries & slaw.  The guy behind the counter was warm, friendly and genuine.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but for a pretty steep price.  I love the chicken and pork pitas. They're super flavorful and the fries wrapped up inside the pita itself makes it all the more tasty!  Great to visit once in a while, but definitely too expensive to eat at regularly."}
{"text":"I walked to It's All Grk today for lunch.  I got there about 11:45am before the lunch crowd arrived.  As soon as I walked in, the girl who takes the orders welcomed me (as she did with everyone).  It's cute inside with high communal tables and chairs.  I ordered a chicken dinner and a Diet Coke (it came to about $20).  It's a big serving that includes chicken, potatoes, rice, salad, pita bread and tzatziki ... so unless you are really hungry, split it with someone (I didn't come close to finishing it).  I love Greek food and wish I could say I loved this ... but I didn't.   First of all, I was expecting to get chicken souvlaki (chicken chunks cooked on a skewer) ... instead this was small pieces of sliced chicken (it was from the same vertical spit they cut the gyro meat from) that had been fried so it was kind of greasy and most were hard and crunchy.  I didn't realize 'til later that you have to ask specifically for souvlaki to get it (whenever I've ordered chicken at a Greek restaurant, that's what I got).  Had I known, that's what I would have ordered and paid the extra $2.  I had mentioned to the girl taking my order that it was the first time I'd been there so I wished she'd explained the difference.  In addition, I like oregano but I found there was way too much on everything.  It was overpowering and all I could taste.  The best part of the dish was the rice.  I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food so had supper this evening at Greek & Co.  I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner with no salad.  Everything was really good except for the rice ... it was cold and hard :(  The chicken seemed freshly grilled.  The potatoes were hot and lemony.  The pita bread was warm.  The tzatziki was chilled and refreshing."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst overpriced salad place. I ordered a Greek salad and got nothing but green peppers, no feta or anything a Greek salad comes with, usually. It claims to come with chicken but it wasn't even 1 skewer. There were merely 3 tiny pieces. I feel ripped off and unsatisfied. It cost 20$  Never getting this again.  Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"This place opened on king a few weeks ago so hence the lack of reviews. I came here for a quick bite and grabbed the chicken gyro. The gyro surprised me since it was much better than I had expected and among the best gyros I've had in toronto. The bread was soft, there was plenty of meat and some fries thrown in. The gyro was well put together and not soaking in sauce. While there is a decent amount of seating this I think is more of a take out place. That said, I will be coming back.  Update: my wife tried the veggie gyro and she loved it. Also said it's the best veggie gyro she has had In a very long time."}
{"text":"There's so much good here, so I'm really disappointed that the owners of this place have decided to skimp on one of the most important parts of running restaurants: staff training and customer service.  The low star ratings are not without merit. Although the decor in this restaurant is really stylish, the food very tasty and the prices pretty reasonable, it's obvious that the staff that work here are incredibly unhappy and overworked.  I've been here a couple of times and each time it's staffed by younger girls with only one person actually doing the cooking. During the lunch rush hour it's just a mess. So many people are standing and in the way waiting for their food because it's taking too long. Nothing is really served in order because often times the person on cash gets overwhelmed and forgets to call out orders.   This place could be fantastic, but the staff here need to be treated better and trained a bit more."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but the quality and flavour has gone down. It's also appallingly pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after hearing some good reviews, but after a couple solid efforts, I'll chalk it up as average at best.   The first time I went for lunch, it was pretty busy. Grabbed a gyro, with everything on it. Meat was moist but felt a bit disappointed with the amount of toppings. It was busy so I wrote it off.   Second time around, I got the chicken souvlaki dinner. Portions were good, but the potatoes were overcooked, and the chicken was under seasoned. I guess I was just hoping for more....  For Queen St W, there's not too many Greek options so I guess GRK is your best option if you're close by. With so many other good food options though, it might be worth it to walk a few more steps."}
{"text":"This place was very authentic, reminded me on a kebab shop I visited in Santorini. Good, fresh food. Meat is definitely on the dry side but this is a normal Greek thing, they cook the #$%$ out of meat so it's not surprising. Tzatziki sauce was good.  Good food overall but menu options are a bit boring, would like to see them add some mezes, it's easy enough to make spanikopitas, dolmades, bougatsa, etc to go."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying the gyros here and man.. it is one tasty gyros. Had the chicken gyros, it was so juicy and delish. I feel like eating this everyday. And the french fries they put in.. could probably eat a whole basket of these they are seasoned to perfection. The tzaziki sauce is so good as well. Price for the gyros is reasonable around $8.   Will be back for more gyros."}
{"text":"Love the set up and openess of It's All GRK. Perfect fit for the neighbourhood!  Simple menu with 4 choices: pork, chicken, beefteki and souvlaski/ gyro, piato, dinner and salad.  Souvlaki($7.49) and Pork($6.99) Gyro is nicely prepared and the tzatziki sauce is well flavoured. The only complaint maybe the meat is on the dry side.  A good alternative if you are chilling along Queen Street! Nice friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and cozy atmosphere right off of queen. Tasty gyros at reasonable prices, could use a few more vegetarian options! Limited seating but you can usually get a spot even during lunch rush"}
{"text":"It was a very disappointing experience. I will NEVER order from this restaurant again. Potatoes were not cooked - they were raw & chicken was extremely dry. They didn't include salad dressing or any kind of sauce. No tzatziki either :-(.   Queen West has some great restaurants who actually care to satisfy their customers and GRK isn't one of them.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Good food but really pricey. The dinner chicken Slovakia is like $18. Pretty basic meal for a big price."}
{"text":"I've been to It's All GRK countless times, but recently the consistency in quality of the food has gone down. It's a bit of a hit-or-miss which is sad, because when its good, it's really good. It just depends on who's behind the counter putting together the food."}
{"text":"A new location in the Annex!   Fries INSIDE the wrap. That's what I'm talking about!  The pork wasn't dry or overcooked. I almost choked on it, yes, but that's because it was so tender and buttery!  I'm definitely coming back.  The sides look amazing!  Good price point too @ $6.75 for the pita, $10 for the plate, $15 for the dinner ... whatever that means."}
{"text":"Unfortunately inconsistent.  I'm a regular and I do love this place, but lately there's been a sharp decline. The pork and chicken is inedible. The last three time it's just been pieces of mush with scattered pieces of burnt tough pork or chicken. The chicken souvlaki is the only safe bet. The same with the salads. Depending on who's making it depends on whether it's done right or not. The cretan is inconsistent. Some times the rusks are crunchy and there's balsamic. Sometimes there's no balsamic and soggy bread."}
{"text":"So, visiting Canada and the family decided we'd eat at a Greek place we passed while walking downtown Toronto. It was a small place, nice music playing, no line, so in we went.  Chart that as mistake number 1. The normal lamb was not on the menu so the husband and I were thrown. But, being team players we decided to give it a try anyway.  That would be mistake number 2.  I got the chicken gyro and the husband got the steak. Both were horrible. And I emphasize horrible as in I literally could not eat it. I took one bite, and the taste was like nothing I'd ever eaten before. It was like a sour milk flavor to the sauce and a heavy paprika taste mixed with sour milk on the chicken.  Not wanting to appear the only one not eating, and thinking that perhaps it was just me, I tried another small bite, which felt like was swelling in my mouth. I had to spit it out. I quietly asked my husband if he liked his and he stated a stern \"NO\".  So, my 1 star for this place- a gift! It was hands down one of the worst places I've ever eaten.  It falls right behind the BBQ place I reviewed here some time ago.  Do yourself a favor and pass!"}
{"text":"Just had a $13 \"chicken\" plate to go.  It was absolutely bad!! I think my stomach would take a few days to recover from that experience. The  plate was filled with grease and the \"chicken\" was actually chunks of fat!!   I actually called the place (took about 15min to get a hold of them) and the guy had nothing to say other then \"Ok, we'll look into it\"    Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Looking for tasty, filling, and affordable gyro or pita? Greek and Co is my go to for their chicken gyro. It's fresh, very flavorful and even filled with fries to give that extra texture. And if you're really hungry then have their plate dinners, it will fill you up!   Service is always quick and friendly. This is a great place to grab and go, or even dine in."}
{"text":"Large portions with fresh meat and veggies, friendly staff and clean facilities. Great for a quick bite or grab to go"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need meat and some sneaky French fries wrapped in a warm pita. Add some delicious white sauce, and you're winning. You know what I'm talking about.  Greek & Co is a great place to pop in for a quick satisfying lunch. It isn't anything particularly special, but it does the trick."}
{"text":"im a huge fan of Greek food, i still remember the day i tried feta cheese and my life was changed forever. Ive come to really struggle to find decent/good/great Greek restaurants that are budget friendly, and for all purposes away from the \"greektown\" section of Toronto, due to it being slightly painful to get to. much like the queen street location, the annex location offers the same fair, but is a larger location, this location is spotless again like the queen st location, the staff are extremely friendly and seem very eager to help, please and assist. the food is super fresh and hot made to order. i highly recommend getting some extra sauce with anything that you get, not for nothing, the tzatziki sauce can be extremely addictive and full of garlic. this location is extremely transit friendly, but not very car friendly, as its only street parking, and being bloor st, its always packed. the reason why this location lost a star is due to \"false advertising\" the back wall has a vinyl plastered list of the menu, and lists lamb as an option, but not on the main menu? not sure what that's all about... otherwise, a great location for budget friendly Greek food"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ever laid my teeth into fr a gyro...they add fries to the gyro which you think might b a bit weird but it actually balances the portion out properly. The drinks they import from Greece are a bit on the weird side...but  Pricing is great and variety of the menu is awesome 5+"}
{"text":"Shitty service. The two counter girls I have encountered here both clearly hate their job. I've been here a few times, while the food is decent, I expect the service to be quality too, for the price I am paying. The most recent and final time I went here, I phone ordered for pick up and when I went to pick it up, my order was completely wrong. Instead of offering to fix it, the girl at the counter began to blame me and kept saying 'well this is what I heard you say on the phone.' When I asked her if she could make what I originally ordered, she said that she couldn't because they were out of that particular product at the time. They probably just cooked the wrong thing because they didn't even have what I originally ordered but just decided not to tell me. I couldn't believe how rude and argumentative this girl was, and didn't even bother to apologize.  The other cashier I had encountered here previously always had a sour look on her face and made it seem like I was greatly inconveniencing her when I asked questions about the food. The first time I went there and inquired about my food allergies, she rolled her eyes and didn't initially give me an answer until I asked again. Needless to say, I will not be back here. They clearly don't care to retain customers. Good customer service goes a long way, and I would rather travel a bit further out of my way, to spend money in an establishment that actually seems like they want me to be there."}
