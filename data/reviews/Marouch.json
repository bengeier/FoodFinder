{"text":"A friend of mine invited me over for a healthy Lebanese breakfast. The place is small but very welcoming and the smile over the faces really make you happy by being there.. Their hospitality was on point :)  We ordered some fresh vegetables, hummus some other goodness from the menu which I really can't remember the spellings of the names..Lol !  I love trying new places that I never been to before and this is a place that will make me come back :)  I also learned a new word \"sahten\" which means bon appétit :)"}
{"text":"Great food, authentic Lebanese cuisine the service is very quick and they are attentive , and Lebanese hospitality, for sure be back if I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Still the best and only foul breakkfast place in the greater Montreal area! It's on Curé-Labelle street in Laval. If you're in Montreal and want to have an authentic Lebanese breakfast, this is the place to go!  The best authentic Lebanese breakfast in the Laval area! Foul moudammas, Balila, msabha, awarma, etc. tried them all and they're all delicious.  The new place on cure-labella is larger. Very welcoming and friendly staff. Must try if you're looking for Lebanese authentic breakfast."}
