{"text":"i seriously don't know what to do about this place.  the place is very nice-looking (lots of exposed brick and wrought iron).  there was no band on the night we went, just a \"big band\" singer, who hubby and i very much enjoyed.  the menu was limited and a bit overpriced, but it was pretty tasty.  however...  they were out of EVERYTHING.  it was a friday night, and there were only a few tables in there at 7:30.  they had no draft beer at all (all the kegs were kicked) no tanqueray, so i drank beefeater for a while, and then they ran out of tonic water.  despite boasting a \"scotch bar\" on their website, they were (you guessed it )  out of almost every kind of digestible scotch.  their drinks were, frankly, outrageously overpriced.  i usually don't mind paying too much for booze, but $4 for a bottle of yuengling is just insane to me.  also, there was the matter of the service:  very friendly, which is why i hate to say this, but it was awful.  painstakingly slow (almost an hour for our dinners, it took about 20 minutes to secure our server long enough to tell her we wanted to order.)  the girl was very friendly, but didn't have a clue.  when she informed me (after she went to the bar, put the order in, and had the bartender tell her) that they were out of tanqueray, i inquired as to what kind of gin they had.  she didn't know.  very very nice, though.  all in all, i don't know what this place is like when there's a band there.  i hope for their sake they stock things better.  (i posted this review a while ago, and i came back looking for something else and realized it had disappeared.  buh?)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best jazz places in Pittsburgh, but on Thursday nights it doubles as a great salsa club.  When I would go, the band Azucar would play Salsa/Fusion music that was fun to listen to and fun to dance to.  In general, the club was never too packed and everybody was very friendly.  One of my favorites in Pittsburgh."}
