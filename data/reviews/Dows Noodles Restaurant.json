{"text":"The overall Hot Pot AYCE food quality here is pretty high. Prices are average so nothing special but if you order from the seafood menu set they give you additional oysters, mussels, salmon etc. The only problem was that the service was pretty slow when I was here and it wasn't even that packed. I can't imagine how they manage during busy dinner hours. 
They also give you complimentary plum juice that's refillable - take my word, this tastes really gross at first because it's really sour/bitter but if you're planning to try any of the spicy soup bases for your hot pot, it definitely hits the spot when trying to cool your tongue from that burning sensation."}
{"text":"My husband and I normally don't eat hot pot outside, but given that a friend from out of town really wanted to eat here we obliged.
The place was horrible.  It was -20C outside and they chose not to turn on the heat.  Our hot pot took more than 20 minutes to get boiling while we noticed that other people who got their pots after us had a full roiling boil.  
We ate very little because the service was slow and things looked suspicious.
Our stomachs were very mad at us that night and my husband threw up all night.  I had cramps all day the next day.
Stay away from this place its absolutely horrid."}
{"text":"This restaurant and the Hipot Hot Pot Restaurant a little to the east (on north side of Hwy 7, off Chalmers) shares the same Chinese name. By the look of trademark/logo and menu, they belong to the same chain. 

AYCE style. One price for \"beef combo\" and slightly higher price for \"seafood combo\". 

Typical cantonese style hot pot, which is like a fondue done with flavourful broth (instead of cheese or chocolate). There are a variety of broth to choose from, some included in the base price while others will cost extra. 

Good: 
+ excellent quality beef, good marbling, and sliced to just the right thickness 
+ home made \"fish noodles\" (that's the white mousse in a piping bag which is made of pure fish, you pipe the string directly into the broth to cook) 
+ beef/squid/pork balls are all home made 
+ free dessert, of quality 
+ good service, quick to respond and attentive 

Not so good: 
- Seafood items are not all-you-can-eat, even if you order the \"seafood combo\" 

I'd go back because of the quality of food."}
{"text":"Haven't been hot pot in a really really long time and decided to take my buddy out for his birthday. 

The soup bases were quite tasty. We got the satay soup base as well as the peashoot and preserved egg soup base. You can choose from either a seafood or meat all you can eat menu. However, be warned that some items on the seafood one are not all you can eat. They are a one-off or you pay additional for extras. We went with the meat one.  There was a pretty big menu ranging from the standard marbled beef to pork liver. Definitely won't be bored.

I do caution that amateur hot pot goers go accompanied with an experienced hot pot connoisseur as the cooking times for various items differ. My stomach felt a bit weird when I got home and it may be because I didn't cook some of the items long enough before consuming. Or maybe I have a protein overload... But my stomach is having a very audible monologue to itself as I write this review... They give you a prune soup to aid in digestion as you are consuming an abnormal amount of protein in one sitting. It is a very strong tasting concoction at first, but it grows on you after the initial Buckley's like reaction fades. 

For dessert they have 3 options... turtle jelly (which I found to be wayyyy bitter even with the syrup on top), mango pudding or egg custard. 

The service was pretty bad. We made our initial order and they neglected to bring a few items, we ordered a second and third time and again they forgot... I don't think any of the servers ever smiled... 

All in all the food was good."}
{"text":"I went on a holiday and expected it to be super busy. To my surprise the wait was not long at all - 15 minutes maybe. The servers were very friendly and patient despite how busy it was in there. The food came really fast and I got to eat right away. The server knew in advance to bring on the beef and the lamb right away. Smart! Mid-way, he saw that we were all done with the beef so he brought more before we even ordered them - double smart! At the end, we had a choice for dessert: mango pudding, turtle black jelly, or steamed egg (warm dessert). I went with the mango pudding and it was delish. I will definitely come back, but not anytime soon because I cannot afford to stuff myself like this all the time."}
{"text":"Renovations were done. The doorway is now completely made of glass with one of those push/pull doors. 

I came out of this place reeking of hot pot and I didn't think I would since it was not that hot inside and there was not a lot of visible steam and the door kept opening and shutting. One week later and my sweater still smells of it. 

It's a shame because hot pot is a winter sport and as such most people are layering up with heavy sweaters and what not.*** Still really good food. This place is a bit more expensive as it comes with one \"complimentary\"* seafood dish that includes: salmon, muscles, shrimp, oysters (1 per person) and scallops with enoki mushrooms. 

They give out a piping bag full of some white opaque substance, this is homemade noodles and you just squeeze it into the boiling water and eat. It doesn't take long to cook and it's actually not too bad but don't overcook it or else it gets gummy.

{"text":"Hot pot is an experience which might be a bit daunting for the newcomer but on cold wintry nights, it just rocks. Shabu shabu is the Japanese variant. Bring an experienced friend if you can.

So how does this work? 

Well, they bring out a big pot split in half - clear broth on one side and a spicier broth on the other side, which then boils on the heating element built into the center of your table. They bring you multiple platters of meats, seafood, veggies, noodles etc. which you then proceed to cook in the steaming hot pot. Fun.

Dow's is a clear favourite among the Asian crowd given the masses that huddled around the steaming pots every weekend. Sometimes it is just packed and the steam fogs up and permeates everything inside.

It is buffet style here, so that means you pay a set price (about $20) per person and you can cook to your hearts content with your personal hot pot.

Just a few quick notes:

1) It is raw meat you're dealing with, so keep your chopsticks and utensils clearly marked unless you want to make love to your toilet later that night.

2) Choose the order and ingredients carefully, with a clear understanding that certain things take longer to cook (beef tendon) and other things, if they get lost in the pot, they might end of a flavourless mush (I lost my taro cube, bummer). 

3) Side tables are helpful to keep the dishes organized but you will be overwhelmed by multiple dishes and sauces. 

A few tips for Dow's, the standard spread usually includes a seafood platter (squid, whole shrimp, oysters, mussels), a beef platter, a \"balls\" platter (wontons, pork balls, shrimp balls) a few veggies (lettuce and spinach, tofu if you like) and you can order a few rice dishes, noodles (squeezed from an icing tube) or udon on the side. They also always bring out a \"plum\" drink which I guess is some palate cleanser or \"good for you\" as my mother says about anything that tastes like crap. I never drink it.

You will leave amazingly full. The broth at the end, after multiple rounds of meats, veggies, seafood ingredients is the best part, so save some room -  (wives tale perhaps, but then if you think about it, all the vitamins probably got boiled out into the broth which is pretty tasty in the end).

After all that, dessert is a pretty good steamed egg custard or mango gelatin pudding with cream. Yum. Undo a button or two and enjoy the hot pot experience."}
{"text":"Very good hot pot all you can eat. Wonton, seafood and soup is awesome. They even give you free dessert & prune juice too! Get their seafood and pay a bit extra. Its worth it. You get shrimp, oyster etc... Been here several times and recommend it to all my friends ;)"}
{"text":"I have been to this AYCE restaurant many times and every time I eat here, it does not fail to disappoint. Although there are some bad things this restaurant has, the food and the service just makes it a 5 star restaurant. To start off, the food at this place is amazing and always fresh. The soups taste like Heaven but they have lots of MSG in it. The service is always friendly and always happy to take your order. On the down side, the place is very crowded. The place is small which makes very little space to move around. In conclusion, this restaurant is one of the best AYCE hot pots around. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to eat a lot."}
{"text":"Not great, not horrible either. 

Dows serves an all you can eat style of hot pot for about 20 dollars. The selection is quite decent - however, the soup base is lacking in substance. 

Not sure if I would come here again."}
{"text":"Dows Noodles Restaurant is closing down this location. 

New owner putting up new store signs...

More Than Hot Pot seems to be  the new business name!"}
