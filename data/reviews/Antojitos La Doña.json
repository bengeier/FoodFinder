{"text":"I'm convinced that the only way to get authentic cuisine in Calgary is to head down 17th Avenue into the SE.  Enchiladas Verde here aren't amazing, buy by far the best I've had in Calgary, (aside from my wife's of course).  Nice little family joint. *NO SIGN* so you have to look for the painted windows, and it is located on an access road to 17th, (parallel business road"}
{"text":"Closed down sometime in the recent past...  Was super excited to try this place after reading all the rave reviews online. Went last night, only to find a sign on the door saying the locks had been changed and it was illegal to enter the premises. Peeked inside, and sure enough, the dining room looked like it's being taken apart.  Pretty disappointing - shame it went out so soon when it looked so promising."}
{"text":"SHORT DESCRIPTION:  Truly authentic Mexican food, excellent quality, and good value.   We went to La Do√±a Mexican restaurant on 17th Ave NW in Calgary for a late lunch.  Simple decor, but fantastic food.  Authentic Mexican restaurant as one might find in Mexico or in East Los Angeles.  They even serve typical dishes like menudo, posole, and mole--and Mexican beverages such as Jamaica, that you don't find in other \"Mexican\" restaurants in Calgary.  I had chicken mole enchiladas and my friend had fish grilled Mexican style.   Good portion sizes.  Prices are  similar to those of other Mexican restaurants.  This is the closest I have seen to authentic Mexican cuisine in Calgary.  Only criticism--they don't take credit cards and their Interac machine wasn't working that day."}
{"text":"The food here was ok.my mom ordered the tilapia... It was literally the whole fish. Not gonna lie we pretended it was talking for a while...very mature I know, next time we will order tacos or something."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, this is easily one of Calgary's best. The atmosphere is basic, but the taste of the food makes up for any shortcomings. The portions are decent and priced fairly. The language barrier with the staff needs to be addresed, but they are prompt and friendly. If you're looking for a posh restaurant, this isn't it. If you're looking to eat good, tasty, authentic Mexican cuisine, get there fast."}
