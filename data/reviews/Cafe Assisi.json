{"text":"It was the best coffeeshop in all of Madison. And then it closed (was it 2003 or 2004?) So, so sad."}
{"text":"I miss it so much. When I first moved to Madison in the mid-90's I found a sublet off of State Street above a Japanese restaurant named Ton-Ton. Cafe Assisi was my first State Street love. Second story co-op coffeeshop above a little indie punk store. My friend Kate worked there briefly and would leave the bakery boxes outside at closing time with the unsold pastries in them for hungry people to find. They had great games and books and cozy spots to hang out and sunshine coming in through the windows over the street. It was warm and breezy in the summer and cozy in winter. Now, I see most coffee shops as trying to be as bright and uncomfortable as possible to keep the traffic flowing. When you find a cozy, comfy place that makes you feel at home and cared for, hang tight and show them your love. Great memories of great people at this one. I wish I'd taken photos then."}
{"text":"A cute, colorful little coffee shop catering to the indie and punk set.  A punky clothing store/head shop shares the second floor landing next to the cafe."}
{"text":"It was! THE BEST!!!!! Starbucks moved in and State St. hit its maximum capacity for cafes, and Assisi was on the second floor, tucked away - so despite its loyal regulars, it shut down since it couldn't pick up the to-go traffic. That's the story of its end. 
Its twenty-year history, with two sets of owners and its reincarnation as a collective, is another story."}
{"text":"This is unusual - I'm looking for a few people that used to work here, if you have any information please message me privately, it would mean a great deal to find them again!"}
