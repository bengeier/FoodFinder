{"text":"Great churrasco. As a native brazilian i appreciate a good meat.   I loved it and I will definitely come back on sundays!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot - their specials run from ~$5-9.  Portions are large, in fact, my sandwich was converted into two meals.  I tried a sandwich with thinly pressed steak, a thin layer of ham, a thin layer of bacon, a thin layer of mozzarella with a fried egg and some sort of mayonnaise-ish sauce on this giant roll.  Really really good.  Served with a side of fries.  The fries were nothing special, but, decent nonetheless.  Coworker tried a two sausage plate with black sausage and a sausage that looked like traditional chorizo, served with a side salad.  He loved the chorizo and said the black sausage (basically blood sausage) was just ok.  Best part of the meal, however, was the soup and rolls they bring out while you wait on your food.  The soup was a potato soup with small bits of corn and ham.  I would have liked this as an entree on some other occasion.  The rolls were served warm with a crisp exterior and a soft chewy interior.  Great for mopping up some soup (probably not great manners to dip your bread into your soup, but I didn't care 'cause that sh*t was good).  Chimchurri and a hot sauce served on the side.  Decor was nothing special, but I've never been a big fan of ambience - I've just always thought it was overated.  I go to a restaurant to eat and to hang out with friends, not admire the decor and lighting.  Our waitress was informative (she gave us the americanized definitions of certain menu items) and flat out funny.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded - 3 total parties inside, so she was the only waitress I saw.  The meal takes a little too long to come out, but that hopefully just means they're cooking everything from scratch.  If you're on adkins or want to participate in meat-fest type experiences, this is the place for you.  Impressed."}
{"text":"I waited so long to get there and what a disappointment it was!  Parking was a struggle as a sign repair truck took up a good portion of the busy lot.  Walked in to a nearly empty restaurant at diner time.  We stood at the door a good five minutes before someone came out to greet greet/seat us.  The man waived us in and  disappeared  into the back of the restaurant.  We sat there for another five minutes before the waiter came out looking frazzled. No menus in hand. We asked for menus, he said he didn't speak English and pointed to a table by the front door where a pile of menus sat.  A non Spanish speaking person in our party asked a question and the man was upset at his not being able to understand.  Really? Your wait staff down not speak English?   I translate the questions about making a special order on a sandwich. The man was now very upset and kept saying NO!  The special order consisted of adding a fried egg, ham, lettuce and tomato to the milanesa. That quickly became a $12.99 sandwich which was served on soggy, stale tasting bread.   Only a third of that sandwich was consumed.  I could see my friends face wince every time he took a bite of his sandwich until he gave up and said it was gross.   I almost enjoyed my short ribs and Russian style potato salad.  My medium rare ribs came out well done with extra crispy ridges.  The potato sale was bland, a side of unripened tomatoes and wilted lettuce didn't help the situation.  It took about 20 minutes to get the check from a female server. When she asked how was everything I expressed my disappointment. Her response is loosely translated to 'oh well'.   Did I mention that the large TV sets were  loudly transmitting the Colombia -Venezuela soccer game? Did I mention that very loud Bachatas played the entire time we where there? Really? At a a  Uruguayan restaurant?   All in a all, very disappointing."}
{"text":"After high expectations it was a big disappointment . We ordered the empanadas and it was ok but the parillada was from bad quality meat with sole like texture. The chorizo was ok. The flan was grainy and just not good; the alfajores  were decent..."}
{"text":"I went there for fathers day and was very disappointed, I have gone to Argentina and have lots of friends from Argentina and Chile and know of there food and environment and this is not is. The day I went was 100 degrees in Charlotte and their air conditioner was not on, the food took forever, they had live music that was way loud for their small location. I put two stars because because they gave my husband a free glass of wine for fathers day."}
{"text":"I went to Che Gaucho in February 2012 with my wife who is from Argentina. I have also been to Argentina and and very familiar with the food.  Trust me, I don't know what they are attempting to serve at Che Gaucho, but it is not Argentine food.  My wife spoke with the staff, and apparently Che Gaucho used to be owned by Agentines but they sold the place.  It is now owned by Chileans or Peruvians I forget. Anyway, my wife and I left the place feeling quite sick.  Stay away.  This place gives Argentine food a bad reputation."}
{"text":"Tris place is heaven te parrillada for 2 is awsome a must try Coldplay beer hot food what else can You asked for go visit you love it..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch and ordered the Parrillada for One and everything was horrible. We are from Bolivia so we have tasted what Parrillada should be... and this was not. The meat was not seasoned and it seemed to be cooked on a skillet and not on the Parrilla... as it should be. We were shocked at the price... but hoped that the taste would offset the shock but it did not. Horrible Parrilada. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Argentine restaurants are very hard to come by in these parts, which is why I greatly anticipated giving Che Gaucho a try. And to make the taste test even more complete, I brought my dad along, who was visiting us from NYC. See, we grew up on \"parilladas,\" a smorgasboard of meats and grilled organs, so if Che Gaucho was going to pass the acid test, it had to rock the parillada.  Che Gaucho is nestled in the back of a quiet strip mall on Old Pineville Road, just off Woodlawn. Blink and you'll miss it. Good thing I had my GPS on my phone. It's a small restaurant, 10-12 tables max. I believe they have tango/folklore nights on Fridays and Saturdays, and if you love futbol, you can get your fix here; you'll likely catch a match from Argentina or Uruguay on one of their flatscreen TVs. It's quiant, unspectacular, unassuming. Nicely decorated.   Our waiter was quite attention, and very quick to offer recommendations. Surprised to learn he was from Nicaragua...nowhere near Argentina, mind you. I want authenticity, damn you! Kidding. He was the tops. Wonderful service. He recommended a very delicious Malbec (my fave wine), which went down very smoothly.  For starters, we had the empanadas. My family (including my wife) have been spoiled by my mother's legendary empanadas. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that no one, and I mean NO ONE, has ever surpassed her empanadas. These were tasty, but not my mom's.   As for the parillada, we very pleasantly surprised. The flank steak was flavorful, not too overdone. The chorizo was tasty, and gently spicy. The sweetbreads were very good. I stayed away from the blood sausage, though. That shit's gross. Ugh. The parillada was tastefully accompanied with a tomato and onion salad on oil, and an \"ensalada rusa,\" basically a fancied-up potato salad. Certainly, the parillada passed our strict tests.  I had no complaints, but my dad would have preferred to have some seltzer/club soda with his wine - even as part of one of the great wine-making nations of the world, Argentines feel the need to add seltzer to their wine, which seems completely illogical to me; it's like Colombians drowning their wonderful coffee in milk - and the bread (this man MUST eat every meal with bread, which is why he avoid Chinese restaurants) option - rolls instead of baguettes - could have been better.   If you've never sampled Argentine cuisine, this is the place for you to do so. And if you have sampled Argentine cuisine before, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food and customer service. Authentic Argentine parrillada. Great customer service, reasonable prices, and a nice wine list. Wish we lived nearby, I'd go there all the time!!"}
{"text":"If you want Argentina food this is it for Charlotte area! Nice but small place. Food is good especially the chimichurri sauce, they had molleja, chinchulini, chorizo, vacio de todo. Even Quilmes, paso de Los toro! My parents are argentine and this is pretty darn close to it, give it a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped here by accident. I was trying to use the mall's driveway to turn and go back to the street when I saw a little sign on the sidewalk saying \"Argentinean restaurant lunch special\". Their lunch special is less than $7 so I decided to give it a try. Is not a pretty location, but everything by Old Pineville is that way, so don't take it by the place it is located. I had a great service from beginning to the end. They have a good variety of meats for their lunch specials and you can also order from the regular menu. I'll try coming again and bring friends to try their regular menu. Also the Alfajores for desert were really good."}
{"text":"Ordered empanadas for a party and they were more than helpful on the phone but completely forgot to make the order. Carvel customer service!"}
{"text":"It's overlooking a train rail and a laundromat. My brother and I came in here, and the place was empty. Those looks can be deceiving.  \"Quieres algo a tomar?\" our waiter asked.  You're speaking my lingo, man. Our waiter was from Uruguay, and he and I reminisced in the broken Spanish I can speak. I lived in Buenos Aires for about four months in 2012 and was feeling nostalgic, so I guess you could say this difficult-to-find place (gracias a Dios para GPS) satiated more than one appetite.  We got beef empanadas to start, which were as cheap as the ones us college kids lived on until we couldn't stomach more of the heavy, meaty and budget-friendly pastries. Che Gaucho's take has a spice akin to the flavor from tacos, and the pastry was bubbly. Though I wasn't as crazy about these, the chimichurri and hot pepper oil served with them was fantastic, and if it makes a good sauce vessel (see also: tortilla chips and guacamole, stale bread and fondue, then it's all right with me.  Now, let me tell you about the parrillada. It is the plate o' plenty if you're a meat-lover. A variety of cuts, flavors, and textures. Images of Xanadu come to mind. For a recreational vegetarian like me, it's a crazy binge that makes me question my life choices up to this point. Or at least question why I don't move back. Be sure to try the morcilla, a blood sausage. The kind that sounds terrible on paper but has the spices and flavoring to turn into a good idea. I also enjoyed the sweetbreads, the tender, fatty kind that make you forget about your running regime. The steaks from the parrillada were wonderfully rich, but if rarely like your red meat rare, be sure to tell your server. \"Un poco rojo\" will get you a very rare, but pulse-free, cut.  I'm not a native, but I will say it's a wonderful deal and an even more wonderful way to try Argentinian and Uruguayan cuisine in the Charlotte area. If you can make it to dessert, I'm sure the alfajores (cookie sandwiches with dulce de leche) would be killer."}
{"text":"So I am upgrading my rating for this place. They have changed owners and they are actually from uruguay so it is much more authentic! Went with the hubs for lunch and although it was empty and the decorations are a bit lacking, I am happy to say we ate until stuffed!   Try the chicken Milanesa sandwich with yummy Russian potato salad or the Choripan (Argentinean sausage on bread)!  By no means does it compare to the TRUE argentinean/uruguayan cuisine we are used to, but I will give three stars just because there is no competition!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while visiting a friend in Charlotte and loved it.   The service was great and the food authentically Argentinean.   The entrana sandwich was cooked to perfection and the empanadas are a good size and fresh made.  The decor and ambiance is just ok,  but if you're looking for real Argentinean food (hard to find in Charlotte!!) this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"Really a great restaurant! Friendly service and delicious food. Lunch specials are really affordable and we'll be back for supper.  The hours for Friday / Saturday are incorrect on yelp site. (See photo)"}
{"text":"Food was cold and overcooked (parrillada). Matambre was horrible. The only thing OK, were the empanadas. Poor service. Very low quality. Overpriced lunch for 2 that we couldn't eat.  I won't recomend it."}
{"text":"Had a layover over in Charlotte and decided to try this place out seeing as how it was only about a block away.  While I can say the food was good ( I had the Argentinian sausage and blood sausage combo), the service left a lot to be desired.  I was only one of 3 other tables being served and it too the waitress about 0-15 minutes to come by and take my order, he place isn't that big, it shouldn't have taken that long. Beside that the lady wasn't one to mix words, she took my order left and came back with the food no small talk or asking how I found everything.  I normally only care about the food but when things turn out like my experience did I think I should at east let others know so they can expect this in the future..."}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to try the food yet, this is just a heads up.   Reboot # 3 - on its third owner now, this restaurant has been bought and is operated by an Uruguayan. I was tipped of this by my neighbor who is also from there.  The old old # is disconnected and the web site is obsolete. I informed Yelp of the changes, in the meanwhile the new number is (704) 500 -0407"}
{"text":"Ordered food through door dash, stated food would be delivered in 40 minutes and close to 1 1/2 hours later we were still waiting.  When we called the restaurant, they stated the food was ready but found out when the door dash person got there the food wasn't ready and after 2 hours we received our food.  Sandwich was good, but fries were undercooked and unseasoned."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the empanadas delicious, the parrillada really fulfill my expectations, but the only fish dish that they have was greatly disappointing. I really appreciate that it was taken off the check, but if offer a dish besides your specialty, why not served it, the way it should be."}
{"text":"Great food, great people! The food is always delicious, it's a great restaurant to come with kids! Everyone is always friendly and in a good mood."}
{"text":"Let's start with Service, it was good service our server Carlos was extremely nice and made us feel very comfortable, however it was a bit busy for them to only have one server, so it was not really the guy's fault. He had a table with over 12 people, and 3 more tables on a saturday night.   Their Maracuya (Passion Fruit) drink was unbelievable, it was amazing, so it's a must have if you go there. Decided to order the Parrillada for 2, and we had plenty left over. Some of the stuff in that parrillada was good and some other well not my thing but most of it was amazing.  Prices are not what they have on the website, they are a lot more expensive in the menu, I assume it is because of the new owners, but they should at least change it. Parrillada for 2 was over $32.00, so definitely expect to pay a lot more than the website menu says.  I do have to say though, it was absolutely worth it, really good ambience and music. Location is really not that open to be seen, I had to look it up, have gone through there several times and never seen it before."}
{"text":"Ok, perhaps to locals they might be impressed, but to someone coming from Miami they are subpar at best! Let's begin with the fact that they don't have Entraña on their lunch menu which is their most popular dish. I went ahead and ordered the so called Churrasco at almost 20$ and as I expected it was a big disappointment. For starters it was NOT Entraña! More like a cheap steak from Denny's   I've been eating skirt steak for years! This was not one. It was very fatty and overcooked and poorly seasoned. I would not recommend to anyone who's knowledgeable on Argentinian food.   I will give them credit for their lentil soup, it was tasty, but that's where it ends."}
{"text":"I have a hard time feeling okay with paying $25 for a plate of food in a crappy strip mall in the hood. I wasn't ready to drop that kind of cash so I got the chorizo sandwich for $6 and it was not enjoyable. With that said, I'm biased toward Mexican chorizo which I adore. Just not at all what I expected."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after someone personally raved about the food but this place did not live up to the hype. I now am questioning whether we ate at the same restaurant. I'm surprised they have as many stars as they do. The service was subpar. When I asked about one of the items on the menu it was described to me 'as a fibrous cut of steak'. Idk what that is and it didn't sound appetizing. We ordered the empanadas, asado, chorizo and molleja. The food at best was bland, nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Tasty, tender steak. Parillada x2 plenty food. A good sangria best way to end this dinner. I notice a good improvement addition of booths looking much much better....great job guys!!"}
{"text":"I love sweetbreads and the Argentines are known for grilling organs.  I am most fond of the thymus gland but I ventured into small intestine at Che Gaucho which was surprisingly good.  I didn't even dare to ask what the pate' like substance was inside.  Anyhow, we ordered the mixed grill item so we could try various offerings.  The flank steak was overdone but had a good taste.  I wasn't too fond of the blood sausage as the texture was weird and one may have to acquire a taste for it (and it was too close to Halloween!). Other sausage offerings were good.  My favorite was the chimichurri sauce - fresh.  The sides were poor: rice was yellow and bland, the mashed potatoes were instant, and the potato salad was bland.  Sangria was good for the price (approx $16 for the pitcher).  If I go again I will try the sweatbreads plate again only sans the sides except bread and try their traditional herbal drink - mate'.  Located near the Lacrosse store by the Woodlawn Light Rail Station."}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service ! It is also priced right, not over priced. I am from the south of Brazil and have been to Uruguay and Argentina many times. In the south of Brazil we are meat eaters!! This place have an AUTHENTIC cooking, taste and meat. The meat is actually imported from UY. The service couldn't been better, which is what you expect from south american restaurants. Don't forget to order the FLAN with Dulce de Leche for dessert. A must go ! The restaurant is simple but the food and service is outstanding. The service and cooking are done by the owners and they come check you out always. You'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I usually try to eat healthy. No pork, little to no red meat, some chicken. But something in me cracked. I was laser focused. I drove my family to che gaucho with every intention of letting my dormant carnivore take over me.   We ordered the parrillada, which basically is meat on top of meat with meat on the side of it. Oh and a small salad.     My wife has celiac disease which means no wheat, soy, malt barley etc. We figured all was well. Meat on fire, move to plate and serve. What could go wrong?? Boy did it go wrong. As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot my wife's stomach started swelling, a symptom of her disease. The poor thing was in agony for two days.    Needles to say, we won't be going back. As far as the food was concerned, I thought it was ok. Nothing great. Maybe my taste for red meat  really is gone. I was hoping for a good result, unfortunately it didn't happen."}
{"text":"The only best thing about this restaurant is the complimentary lentil soup and the fresh baked breads. The sauces is very good. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"BEST STEAK IN CHARLOTTE! this place is a hidden gem. It's tucked away in the back corner and looks kinda sketchy but don't let that scare you. This place is a must try! During lunch, you will get free soup appetizer. The steaks are better than any expensive steakhouse. Prices here are fair and food is superb! Seriously, stop thinking about it and just give it a try. I promise it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. It is not fancy or high end but it is very cozy and delicious. On Fridays and Saturdays they have a live guy singing all genres of latin music and the atmosphere gets super nice. Great vibes. The food is hands down delicious. An array of meats that will satisfy the palate just perfectly!! The wine and sangria are also exquisite. This place is a must. I highly recommend it and stand firmly behind my 5 stars..... ;)"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to find this gem in North Carolina across from a Bojangles and IHOP.    First time with Argentinian food, and it was amazing.  The waitress was very friendly and the food came out quickly.  I'm not really a carnivore but all the dishes I had were excellent: pechuga de pollo, ensalada russa, provoleta (wow, just wow).  Cleaned my plate with a glass of sangria to wash it down.  The pechuga de pollo was pounded flat, soooo flavorful, and tender.  Definitely recommend if you haven't had Argentinian food before!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with a friend tonight who is an Argentine food lover. This was one of the best meals I can remember.  I will be going back at least once this week before heading home this weekend.  It was fantastic!  Had the empinadas and pinchos tonight.  My first Argentine experience will definitely not be my last.   Thank you Yelp for the info on Che Gaucho!"}
{"text":"wooo this was incredible to believe. 1- Google appears closed, but we found it open, and we ordered  parrillada for two. 2- The waitress did not understand Spanish or English. 3- The potato salad tasted very weird. 4- We get sick with the meat.  I think they need to make changes."}
{"text":"My parents are from Argentina so, I've grown up on this food. I've also been to Argentina a few times. Let's start with the good.  The food was good.  The empanadas(chicken and beef), milanesa(breaded steak), tortilla espanola, entrana (skirt steak), ensalada russa were all great.  I didn't care for the choriso (sausage) they used, the chimichurri was ok.    The bad was everything else.  The service was terrible, not sure if our waitress was new but she really didn't know what she was doing.  She missed people's drink orders, messed up a couple of orders. We had to call her over more than once. The food came out at all different times(We had a party of 11).  Up to 10 minutes apart on some dishes.  Then there was a man singing, which he was OK but at the volume they had it, it was hard to carry on a conversation.  At one point I was thinking maybe the guy singing and the guy walking around taking picture should stop and help the wait staff. The prices of the food was also very disproportionate and somethings a bit pricey.  The place isn't very well decorated and the temperature was a little warm.   My rating is still 3 stars as I can't find this type of food anywhere else but the only time I may go again is at an off hour lunch or when it's less crowded."}
{"text":"Great parrillada for two, actually more than we could eat. A friend from Argentina rated it as authentic .  The Argentine wines were good.  Service and attention were great. Tricky to find, though..."}
{"text":"Finally made it into Che Gaucho (if you're wanting to head there for lunch after 1pm, call ahead, they apparently will close early on days lunch is slow) and I can't wait to go back for dinner. Tucked into the back of a fairly dismal strip center, the restaurant is pretty bare itself. Clean, and with an odd little bar setup, but very tan and very plain... with a unexpectedly large TV.   The menu is in spanish with english descriptions, and they offer daily lunch specials. Apparently all lunches come with a free cup of soup, and we were treated to a delish chicken one with a good portion of bread. I had browsed the menu online before our first attempt to eat here, but the menu we were given had some different items on it (and was missing a few).   We went with the empanadas to start (2 beef, 1 cheese), the pastel de choclo, and a churrasco sandwich with avocado/tomato. The beef empanadas were pretty good, while the cheese empanada was a lot of dough with a tiny piece of melted cheese in a huge air pocket. The dough, I have to say, is luckily quite tasty. The pastel de choclo was as expected, a delish corn pot-pie of sorts with beef, olives, and hard boiled egg in the middle, it's smaller container was the perfect lunch portion. Also, it's served with a heaping bowl of tomatoes and raw onions tossed in cilantro, but that went fairly untouched. The sandwich was tasty, and even though there was a request for no mayo it came with it, about a cup of it, smooshed between the lettuce and the top bun. After some scraping it was salvaged, and it was a flavorful piece of meat and a decent sandwich (served with fries). The two sauces on the table (one is a chimichurri and the other maybe closer to a salsa?) were nice condiment options.  The server was very friendly, though my water sat unfilled for a bit, and although we made it out in a standard lunch hour, the entree portion came out a little closer to the end than we would have liked. Of course that could have been skewed by us ordering an appetizer, but I look forward to ordering dinner (especially the mixed grill) and not feeling like I have to rush through a bit of my meal to leave on time."}
{"text":"Casual restaurant. The churrasco was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked and delicious. One of the best argentinian places we've visited. And the cheese empanada was my favorite. I could eat 10 of those! Price was fair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, even though the food was served reasonably fast, the service could've been better. Would deffinitely recommend if you want a good meal."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Has that hole in the wall vibe that really have to roll the dice on to find. Staff is very friendly and had a family feel to it.  Atmosphere is really low key and the music playing just fit the place really well.  Looks like the host kaoroke a few times a week so I'm assuming there is a sense of community to this place. The menu is like a fusion of Spanish and Italian food mixed with South American influences.   The food was excellent. They have a lentil soup that has just the right amount of onion in it that hit the spot on a cold day like today.  They have salt if you want it but honestly you don't need it. There is no pepper shaker on the table or sauces, because they know what they are doing.   The soup was accompanied by red and green chimichurri that is to die for. It has the perfect amount of spice and flavor to open up your senses for the coming meal( I mixed some in with my rice).  The lunch special was amazing. This was my first time trying Argentine food so I went right for the Black Sausage and Argentine Chorizo. The food was out quickly and the plate was simple yet elegant.  It featured two sausages you could tell were hand made and fresh just looking at them, paired with a mound of rice and a simple salad.  I went with the Chorizo first. Wanting to do it right I cut it with a knife and popped the bite into my mouth. I was overwhelmed with a mouthful of flavor that was unlike any sausage I've had be fore. I was really impressed by the mixture they went with of spices.  Next I went with the Black. The black seems to bee some kind of blood sausage and looked hand stuffed. I'm no stranger to blood as I come from a polish background but I knew I was about to be in for a treat.  The sausage was warm and gooey with a consistency in between meatloaf and meat pudding, it had a smoky, meaty, hearty flavor that you can tell comes from a recipe perfected over generations. After my first few bites I mashed it up into my rice and went to town.  The plate was the perfect amount of food for a lunch and I left completely satisfied.  I'll definitely be back and want to experience the dinner and show someday soon."}
{"text":"If you like big portions and delicious food this is the place for you.... I had more than I could eat. the only inconvenience for me was the location which is not very accessible and parking is a little small.. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was horrible. Small and crappy an the food wasn't good. Its in a hard to find corner of this tiny plaza and that's probably one of the reasons its struggling. The owner clearly has lost interest in this business."}
{"text":"We were a little worried after pulling into the parking lot that the area may not be safe. However, very safe, nice sit down restaurant. Food was amazing. I ordered the pesto Gnocchi. They have 2 toppings at the table.  A spicy spinach and a hot pepper. Both fantastic. The host gave us lentil soup to try and that was excellent also."}
