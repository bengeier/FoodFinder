{"text":"by far this restaurant was the worst experience I have had in a long, long time.    To start there was a long, black hair inside the batter in my fish, which was barely cooked.  When i returned the fish to the waitress, showing her the hair, she simply looked at me with a look that said \"oh well\".  The waitress returned to my table with a meager, ingenuine \"sorry\" and a new piece of fish that was raw inside the batter!! Really?? When my lunch friend called her over to talk about the service we were receiving, the waitress could clearly not be bothered and could be heard walking away from us saying \"I wish people would just be more understanding\".  I had asked should your cooks, especially the one's with long pony tails be wearing hair nets? I didn't even get a response to that - just a scowl.  What was most appalling was it turned out this waitress was the OWNER!!!! Wow!! For someone starting a new business this is certainly not the way to start.   My experience in other restaurants is that is a mistake has been made with your order, or God forbid a hair in your food! the server and manager would be most apologetic and genuinely sorry for what happened. This woman didn't even offer a discount off our order which was barely eaten bc it was not cooked and definately not one bit sorry for our experience.  Unbelievable!! Safe to say I will not return to that restaurant"}
{"text":"Cod Fish and Chips Cod: Overcooked, watery (almost certainly frozen), batter okay but bland Fries: Stale, salty Tartar Sauce: Very Acidic  Atmosphere: Boring, dull, loud tvs force people to talk loudly, has that hospital waiting room feel  price: $10 for a lousy piece of fish and crappy fries? I don't thinks so.  Would I recommend? Hell no.  UNLESS the owner apologizes and promises my next visit will better and they will make changes (I AM NOT ASKING FOR FREE FOOD!)."}
{"text":"Baltimore is Neat and tidy with great service and decent food.  Fish and chips with a mix of burgers etc on the menu. I chose the halibut and chips dinner and substituted coleslaw for salad.  Fish - 5 ( very well done with a nice crispy batter and good thickness of fish)  Fries - 3 (a bit soggy and warm...may have been sitting for a bit)  Coleslaw - 1 (looked good but was wet and watery with no real flavor other than an underlying white pepper bite - left most of it)  So that makes for an average of 3.2 so they get rounded down to 3 stars on  the food, however the lady serving us was super nice and working very hard as they were fairly busy and on a Wednesday at 6pm.  Overall I would say they are a good spot that simply had some small miss steps."}
