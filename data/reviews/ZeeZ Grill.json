{"text":"This is a nice little place that does a good job. I had the lunch special which consists of a sandwich, pita chips, and a small drink for around $5.75. The price is right! Their bread is great! It's like a soft ciabatta bread and it tastes homemade. Overall, this is a really good little place and I would reccomend it;  but there are a few problems that I saw.

1. They charge you for putting cheese on your sandwich. It's a deli sandwich! I appreciate the low prices, but give me a break. Throw a slice of swiss on it.

2. It comes with their homemade pita chips that are actually pretty good, but they are all broken little peices and you only get three or four of those broken little peices. 

3. No deli mustard, honey mustard, or any other tangy sauce that could \"kick it up a notch.\" Maybe they are coming later, but a little deli mustard at a sandwich place doesn't seem to be asking for too much."}
{"text":"For a place to go to on lunch, this place is fantastic.  I just went today and got the daily cheeseburger special.  It was less than $6 and I got a cheeseburger with chips and a drink.  The burger was juicy and the bread fresh, and it didn't take long at all for them to cook my burger.  C'mon, a $6 lunch thats not fast food???  I'll take that any day!"}
{"text":"GROSS!
I used to LOVE this place but the last two time I have been I saw major HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS. The worst part is when I looked horrified at what the woman was doing she looked me and said what? I used to be a loyal customer but I just cant ever go there anymore. UNSAFE FOOD HANDELING PRACTICES!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I am completely addicted to their breakfast wraps and red salsa. They make a pretty mean burger and some rockin homemade cranberry white chocolate chip cookies as well. They are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have a brunch here. The service is great,too. The cashier seems little tired, but she is very kind. I ordered everything burrito and tastes full and delicious. There aren't many brunch stores around this area so I would highly recommend people to go this store who works around here."}
{"text":"This place wasn't very good with the old owners and the new owners haven't done any better.  It's a bad location so has to survive off a very small breakfast and lunch crowd which in turn means they have to cut corners.

I think they need to ditch the Zeez's grill and start a bad-a$$ hole in the wall taco/burrito shop which is desperately missing from downtown Phoenix.  Chipotle ain't cutting it."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch while in town for a conference. I got the chicken shewarma, my husband got the Italian sub panini, and a friend got the beef shewarma. My chicken shewarma was really tasty, and the chicken was so damn moist! Food-wise, few things irritate me more than over cooked/dry meat. My husband's panini had a generous amount of meat, so he was a happy camper. The staff was very friendly and gave great recommendations. 

To top it off, they've got a widely varied menu, so if you're not feeling like Mediterranean, they've got a ton of other choices. The prices are great, the place is bright/clean, and they've even got a freezer upfront with frozen treats if you just want a little something sweet. 

I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Update:  This place is horrible now.  New owners = not worth the effort.  It's not anywhere near the quality it used to be.  I'm surprised it's still open."}
{"text":"The food/service isn't the best, & I've heard that it used to be really good.
I went in one day & ordered a half sandwich + side, and they completely forgot my order.  I waited 45 min & no food.
I've gone in a few times since, but only bc it's within walking distance of my office.  I'm not sure if I will continue to patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing, but now not even close. Everything used to be fresh and now the new owners use all pre made products that are not even quality. I used to eat her all the time and no longer. Ya maybe they fixed up the place but what they should have done was put that money towards the food the served. We miss the old owners!!"}
{"text":"I honestly have to revise my rating. I had one bad experience that really wasn't that big of a deal.  Since then I have been back at least a dozen times, and have gotten different things off the menu.  Each time, it was a great experience.  Super sweet staff (owners).  LOVE LOVE LOVE the Bulgogi!!!  It's a super busy at lunch time from all of the County employees eating there, and have had to wait up to 15 minutes, but that's not a big deal - gives you time to unwind and visit with a co-worker."}
{"text":"I've eaten at zeez grill several times because it's convenient. They have a variety of food available and it's good. The restaurant has changed owners several times but the food seems to remain the same. Zeez's is very busy during the lunch hour so I'd recommend calling in your order and picking it up."}
{"text":"I am finally glad to have a new restaurant by my work place.  The food is great and there is actually a place to sit down.  The restaurant has a combination of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Armenian food.  A great combination.

I believe that this is the first time I have found shwarma on the west side of U.S.  - delicious!

A great change from the usual sandwich fair.

Decent serving sizes.

Bon appetite."}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly but I predict the failure of ZeeZ, and am surprised it hasn't been shuttered already. Why would I say such a horrible thing about a small business, in my beloved, favorite area of the Valley known as downtown Phoenix?

When I checked in on Foursquare and was surprised by a special I'd unlocked (25% off for all first-time customers), I showed it to the owner who flatly said she would refuse to honor it. Apparently, she claims, she has told Foursquare she doesn't want the special. When I looked at their Foursquare page, I see that other customers have been complaining about this same issue since as early as March 2013. That means customers have been having conversations about this with this owner for close to a year now. 

If you're not smart enough to know (a) what Foursquare is, (b) that making first-time customers feel bad about having walked into your business is a bad idea, or (c) how to instruct Foursquare to take down a special put in place by previous ownership, I doubt you're smart enough to know how to help your restaurant survive in the long term in this part of town. We downtowners are fiercely loyal to our independent, locally owned businesses, but equally unforgiving of businesses that don't treat their customers nicely. Zeez does not.

And the food? Awful. I ordered a chicken special with avocado blah blah. It was bland. I couldn't finish it. I wouldn't return for that reason alone, much less the unpleasant Foursquare surprise."}
{"text":"You have to search for this place a little, but the prize is worth it. Let me start by saying I have a big appetite and San Francisco restaurants in my blood. I started with the Soujouk an Armenian sausage saut√©ed with sliced fresh tomatoes and onions. It had such bold flavor and balance I just had to try their baba ganoush. The harmony of tahini and faint citrus cooled my soul on this warm day. If I had to critique something, it might be slightly on the thin side but I know some like it this way. Zeez Grill has an open, casual industrial feel with friendly staff. Give um a try. I cannot wait to go back.

Oh Yeah Baklava - perfect! not overly sweet.

\"Call me anything you want but late for dinner\"

Update: Ownership has changed since my review."}
{"text":"This place has great food and it has reasonable prices! The only complaint is that they need more staff to support the amount of customers they have! Definitely order ahead of time if you want to get your food right away. Or avoid going during the lunch hour (12-2pm). Other than that their chorizo breakfast burrito is fabulous! Chicken tenders - fab! Cobb salad - DELISH! And my go to is their teriyaki bowl. So bomb diggity. Yummy yummy food!"}
{"text":"I agree!  A quick downtown alternative with excellent food at good prices.  Don't forget to try the baklava -outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch. Got the provolone and turkey panini with pita chips and hummus and a side of baba ganoush with pita bread.
I haven't had a lot of baba ganoush but I knew I liked it from this other place in Tempe. This place's was a little off smelling, though. I realize everyone is going to have a different recipe but this was completely different in texture and taste than I'm used to. The pita bread was also very thin and dry. It's great for their wraps but not for dipping.
The panini was delicious though and I really liked the pita chips and hummus that came with it. My mother's steak wrap was also really good, though a thicker, moister pita bread would have made it so much better.
A wrap and the panini (both came with chips and small cup of hummus), the baba ganoush with bread, and a can of Dr. Pepper came to just over $18. Not bad for downtown."}
{"text":"Walked over here with some co workers for breakfast. This place is a hidden jem as far as I am concerned. Very friendly staff and great food that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Working on Madison ZeeZ is so convenient and the food is really good. I always get the breakfast quesadilla! The salsa is so flavorful and a favorite of mine. The place is always clean and staff is friendly! Love this place!"}
{"text":"There really isn't anything too special about this place, but they do offer some reasonable lunch specials, sodas, and coffee.

 It's mainly patronized by the people who work in the jail and other nearby buildings. The food itself is average, but it's satisfying & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't understand why so many people left bad reviews on this place. I work in downtown and this was my first time ordering from here. I was a little hesitant and nervous after reading the reviews but I gave it a shot. W delivery for any amount, I was happy to try. The prices were very reasonable for what you get. I ordered the breakfast wrap w bacon (they serve breakfast all day which is an added bonus)!! It was cut in half, came w salsa and it was absolutely delicious and hearty. I also ordered the chicken shawerma (hot) in pita with a side of macaroni. It was absolutely delicious!!!! This shawerma was also cut in half so that I could easily save for later or even lunch tomorrow. I highly recommend this place!! Give it a try!!!"}
