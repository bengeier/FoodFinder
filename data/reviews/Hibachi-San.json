{"text":"Did not like the food or finish it due to them getting my order wrong. I asked for the food with no vegetables,  and sure enough they gave me food with vegetables in it. When I brought it to their attention, they looked at me like I was crazy, and didn't even care.
Also, I asked for soy sauce and a bag due to asking for it to go, and it felt like I was really putting this kid out. I'll definitely not be returning to this place. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Better and cheaper than Panda Express (both belong to the same corporate) in the same mall.  Love the gas fire grilled Teriyaki chicken.  Service is always good, except when a Hispanic guy was the manager for a brief spell back in 2013."}
{"text":"I was just in the mall for an outing with my wife, we always go to the food court with the kids. Today I chose Hibachi San, on top of dried rice, burnt chicken, they feed me steam vegetables without steam. I told the manager my dissatisfaction she basically ask me if I wanted a bowl of the same thing then brushed me off. I had to buy McDonald's to save my meal, who buys McDonald's to save their meal. First and last time eight dollars poorer and got me to finally join yelp :O)"}
{"text":"Uh.. oh...I error. the review is for the hibachi grill buffet, at 10030 n. metro parkway. my bad."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court of the Galleria mall in Henderson.  Japanese food.  I wouldn't really call it authentic Japanese food though. Not much of a selection but it's pretty good.  You have the steak, chicken, fish, & veggie dishes &  they cook it in front of you.  Tepanyaki style.  So it's fresh.  My fav here is the teriyaki steak.  I always get the same thing because again, not much of a selection.  They also have some sushi rolls here but it's in those plastic to-go containers in a little refrigerated cooler in the front .  It's not made when ordered.  My hubby always gets the teriyaki chicken which is alright."}
{"text":"How does this place have a bad review?! I know a ton of people who loveee it. 
Don't listen to the others. This place is soooooo delicious. I've been here at least 50 times by now. I love the chicken and stake. I'm drooling thinking about it. I always order half and half on noodles and rice. Yum yum. So good. I always have leftovers cause it's so much and it's pretty cheap. 
Fantastic place."}
{"text":"Pretty similar to Panda Express. They have a few different options, which is nice. But overall, the food and prices are average. I'd still choose Hibachi-San over Panda any day."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at the Boulevard mall. I love this place! The have the most amazing terriyaki bowls. The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food."}
{"text":"Bad mall sushi.  That's it."}
{"text":"For the popular dish hibachi bowl was the pick. Start with a choice of carbs: white rice, brown rice, fried rice or noodles. This must be dejavu because their carbs were exactly the same as Panda Express!! Anyway they then give you a small fix of veggies which aren't the greatest. Last, choose your meat entree. Choices might be teriyaki chicken (popular), grilled like chicken, garlic chicken and more. This dish is less than $7.

They also have spam masubi which is spam on rice wrapped with seaweed. Yum  this is a common dish among the Hawaiians. Other foods they have are wontons stuffed with cream cheese, egg rolls, potstickers and more. Sushi assortments are available such as rainbow roll, California roll and tuna rolls. 

This is super similar to the Panda Express concept and food wise. It's a good cheap eats kind of place. It does just enough to fill the tummy."}
{"text":"Just so we are clear... This is a food court 4/5 review. I never expect food court food to be great. I would never choose to eat at the food court if I had other options. That being said...

For a food court place, this was pretty tasty. 

Chicken bowl 4/5
Yakisoba 3/5
Poke bowl 4/5

For ppl who complain about pricing, yes... It's expensive and over priced, but it's the food court! Of course it's going to be! 

Duh."}
{"text":"The chicken and the rice were pretty decent. However, it is very OVERPRICED!! I got a side dish of yaki soba and it was $2.75+tax so about $3 for a very small noodle portion (1/3 of their mini box). Crazy."}
{"text":"The food is cooked fresh right in front of you so it's  hot.  You can easily customize your plate and they have lots of choices.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Really rude cook. Two people behind me but birth of their orders come out before mine. Ok, well, I realize that maybe my double shrimp and double chicken (double cost) might take longer but when it's to go, do you think you can give me a bag and utensils that are behind the counter before I have to ask? I could see the cook had an attitude. Hope he didn't do somethingto the food because it wasn't for me, I was picking up for a client."}
{"text":"I don't care what any of you say.

I like this crappy fake Japanese take out.  I've liked it since I was a teenager and nobody can convince me otherwise. 

:-p"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall but the sushi was amazing! and so different!"}
{"text":"The times for good mall food are past us.  *sad face*   When I used to live near the Galleria mall complex 4 or 5 years ago, this place was really good.  Never stingy with the amount of food, great taste, and good customer service.

Fast forward to the present and we have a mediocre product at best.   I used to order the Chicken and Shrimp teriyaki combo with rice and noodles.  The noodles are $1 more.  While the flavor is still there, the portions they give are significantly less.  You have to order 'double meat' just to get close to what they used to serve.   Even so, when the cook was placing the cooked chicken in my box as well as the customer next to me who didn't get double meat, the portions were almost the same.  Maybe they gave me a tad bit more, but not \"double\".

This is still probably the best mall food in Galleria Mall's food court.   Do yourself a favor though and just go eat outside."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I've tried the teriyaki chicken plate and poke bowl. I love how fresh the food taste."}
{"text":"Its mall chinese food, try something else"}
{"text":"I love this! I like how they grill everything in front of the customer (made to order) what I asked for was not in the menu ( all chicken) since they have it with other meats/shrimp. Anyways I ordered teriyaki chicken with brown rice and noodles. It was good loved how they put lots of veggies in your plate. Here's a picture of what I'm taking about!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken with half noodles and half white rice. The staff was pretty stingy with the meat. The steamed vegetables were undercooked. The rice was dry. I'm a bit disappointed----was expecting better since this is owned by Panda Express."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because you could see the chef was working hard with all the orders he had and had no help at all. I waited 30min to get my food at a mall... not only was my food all watery but it had no flavor at all. They are very stingy with the portions and was really disappointed. I ordered the beef(dry and chewy)with noodles and my bf got the shrimp(very small) with rice and noodles. We both agree this place is the definition of bad mall food :("}
{"text":"Never had fast food Japanese before. Wasn't sure what to expect. Got the chicken and steak combo with noodles. Also comes with veggies. Was ok. Meat was a little rubbery. Steak was better than the chicken. Not thrilled with it. Prob should have followed my instincts and went to Kyklos Greek Cafe. I know that place is awesome."}
{"text":"The flavor just drastically changed over the years. I ordered my usual beef and shrimp plate but food was just bland. The sauce that usually gives that signature hibachi flavor tastes like water. Sad."}
{"text":"Good for fast food. Very similar to Panda Express with food choices and taste. Overall okay. Their potstickers are amazing though."}
{"text":"Food was great, I don't see why people complain about the serving sizes. Well at in my opinion the meat portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"My daughter and I loved it, they were out of shrimp, so we had the chicken. Everything was fresh, grilled right in front of us, and the service was friendly. I will definitely eat here again, my boys like the food court and now there's something I can enjoy too."}
{"text":"If you want teriyaki chicken this is the best place in my opinion. I've been to teriyaki boy and teriyaki madness and I didn't think they were that good at all. The only thing is that it's located inside Galleria Mall so it's not exactly a quick pick up if your not already inside the mall.

I've only really stuck to the chicken but they do have the option for steak and shrimp also. They give you decent portions but if your thinking about taking some home or sharing there is also an option for double meat for a minimal extra charge. Make sure to ask for extra sauce too."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I ordered the Angus Beef with noodles to share with my daughter. The meat is like frozen Hungry Man meal meat and then noodles are gross. The broccoli was edible."}
{"text":"I personally love the beef and rice teriyaki plate. I add mushrooms for more intense flavor. I have been to places like teriyaki madness and this place is much better, with fresher ingredients and much better flavor. 

It is mall food, but much better than the traditional hot dog and chicken nugget fare..."}
{"text":"I work at the mall and usually eat here on my lunch breaks. The food is pretty tasty, price for a two item plate is about $6-$7, and the service is decent. I'm not complaining :)"}
{"text":"i have been eating this for years, i moved work and just had the chance to eat here again. the prices went up, the serving is less than what it was. it doesn't taste as good. quality and quantity went down. i am disappointed after having this. they were better in my memories."}
{"text":"We were at the Galleria food court and this was an enticing choice compared to the others. So we tried it. Wife & I both had the \"mini\" Teriyaki Chicken Plate. It was \"Tepanyaki\" style, which includes rice and vegetables. You have a choice of white or brown rice. I took brown, wife took white. The brown rice was just \"ok.\" I'm a rice fan, as I'm from Hawaii, where rice is made and done correctly. So, not really that bad of a downer, as I've had better rice elsewhere. I found the teriyaki chicken to be actually quite good. The taste is similar to Panda Express. The pieces could be the same as well, but Hibachi-San just cuts them up into smaller pieces. I wanted to substitute the veggies for more \"meat.\" They said cannot. So bummers for that. Overall, the taste of the food was good, though nothing \"stellar\" to write home about. If I had to eat here again, I probably would if this were among the only choices to have."}
{"text":"It's Japanese mall food so I didn't expect much but what I got was worse than expected.  I got the shrimp plate with noodles;  there was no flavor to it at all."}
