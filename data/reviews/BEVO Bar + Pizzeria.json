{"text":"Came to this place my first night in Montreal with a group of friends and it was definitely a good pick. Our waiter was really cool and friendly. The food was well 4 out of 5. The meatballs were good but the arancino and antipasti plate were slightly underwhelming, but by no means bad. The main course, think it was penne with prosciutto more than made up for it. 

Only thing that was a negative was the front staff/manager? Even though we were a group of five and the restaurant was 85% empty, they were trying to sit us in a small table for four. Basically had to argue with the guy to get us a larger table. No reason for that."}
{"text":"Ambience was cozy and relaxing fir a Friday night. We were able to get a 4-top upstairs with access to watch hockey. Service was average as the restaurant was not extremely busy. The wood fired pizza was delicious as our kids enjoyed the food as well."}
{"text":"Tonight was a really pleasant experience. The food here really is fantastic, but the service is what really made the evening memorable for us."}
{"text":"Needed to find a good option for customers from Japan nursing 14hr jet lags, nothing too fancy, nothing too heavy, and something familiar. Wood-fired pizza here as authentic as in Tokyo & Naples!"}
{"text":"Just go for the pizza and drinks. The pasta is great but small portions for the price offered.
I live nearby so will likely bring friends from out of town when they feel like Italian food. Nothing like wood oven pizza. 
Btw....just make sure you send the pizza back if it's burnt on the curst. Mine was super burnt but kept my mouth shut."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average, nothing special. Service was very slow. Atmosphere is nice though."}
{"text":"Capriciosa - sausage, mushrooms, hardboiled egg, tomato sauce, mozzarella. The first thing that I thought was... hardboiled egg on pizza? That makes as much sense as mango in a maki roll; preposterous, I declared. Not really, I like weird things - I once sprinkled vanilla ice cream with crunched up bits of BBQ chips, don't judge me, try it! So she cut me off a slice. The savouriness of the generous topping of sausages went really well with the toothsome bite of the roasted mushrooms. The overt sweetness of the tomato sauce was apparent through the cheese and egg.

I didn't know what to think about having chopped up eggs on my pizza. I bit into it and the strangest thing happened. The waitress came over and asked how everything was, and before I knew it, she threw her apron into the air, the other servers pushed the tables aside and the manager jumped down from the second floor via swinging from the oversized chandelier in a choreographed dance. They broke out into song about how eggs have been shunned by the other pizza toppings for so many years and was fighting to find its own identity. It all ended in a rousing crescendo where everyone paused, threw their hands into the air and yelled, \"EGGS!\" No, not really... but eggs on this pizza really stood out - the powderiness of the yolk and that overall taste of egg was the kicker that tied everything together - how I never tried this before, I don't know."}
{"text":"Pizza and ambience are great! Our waitress was helpful and friendly. The restaurant played great music, had a nice atmosphere with low lighting and red brick walls, and the pizza was excellent - I had the giardino and my boyfriend had the capriciosa; both very good. And free wifi to boot! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great pizza - goat cheese and prosciutto, salame and classic margarita pizza. Ambiance was fun and festive, but not too loud. We took 5 kids and felt totally comfortable. Great service..."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal, from the service to the food to the drinks! I have been in Montreal for the first time ever for a few days and I'm a pretty picky eater. Seems like a lot of pork here and a different standard of taste from the states. We were seated upstairs in a very comfortable area. The drinks and food ordered both came out quickly and were extremely good. I made one mistake, ordering a Jack Ceaser, which is comprised of Jack Daniel's, steak spices, and Tabasco. I wouldn't;  order that again just because it was a little much for me, but that's my own fault. A lot of reviews said the Nutella pizza was good. I figured that it would come with more than Nutella and powdered sugar; however, it was very plain and came with just that. Not a bad pizza, but could've had a little more pizzaz!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner with kids. Tasty pizzas and salads, super friendly and efficient staff (and cute), and hip DJ music with a trendy industrial decor. Priced very reasonably. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good food, open late at night, and great Sangria!
We reached there around 10:30PM, and it was the only nice place open, kitchen serving tasty pizza at that time. They were welcoming, good service with smile despite the timing and lateness. Definately recommended."}
{"text":"After spending days in Quebec & Montreal. This is possibly the best restaurant we have been too. The Staff is extremely courteous & food is mind blowing. Staff went out of their way to make soup for my friends son who was hungry after the Kitchen was closed. Now this is customer service at its best.

If you are in Old Montreal - This is THE place to dine in."}
{"text":"All the food was very very good, I had to ask a couple of times to get my water filled as that's all I drink. I needed the water as I had them add anchovies on my pizza. When your having anchovies, water is super important ;-)  So for me the service was just OK. I'd go back for the food tho."}
{"text":"Good pizza, salads and wine list. Pizza is thin crust and enough for one or can easily be shared with a salad. 
Overall very good. Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love Bevo!  The very best pizza in North America.  Excellent location in Old Port.  Excellent, attentive service each and every time I visit Bevo.  Thank you Kim for the great service Monday night!  Bevo has a diversified menu and a really nice wine list.  The restaurant, although casual is beautiful.  Love the exposed brick and the glass enclosed wine closet right next to the front door.  You can sit and watch the men make the pizzas, or your can choose to sit outside or at the bar.  I love this place and I eat here every time I go to Montreal.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are delicious! Thin, crispy and baked to near perfection. Although I find their menu to be rather small, I do have to consider the \"quality over quantity\" saying when it comes to BEVO. Take their Margherita pizza for example, such a simple pizza (cheese & sauce) but the pizza crust was so good & ingredients so fresh that it didn't matter. They even have a great wine list to choose from (go for the white).

The staff...well...a little cold & horrible English skills. Given that the Old Port is a tourist attraction, this surprises me. Had the staff been a little friendlier & had their noses turned up a little less, I would've given this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"An AMAZING resto in an AMAZING location. Not to mention the inside is beautiful!

Right when you get in it smells great, a little loud downstairs but if you got a family they will (if space permits) move you upstairs. The staff is very friendly and helpful, good service all around.

First up the pizza- Perfectly done, as good as any pizza in Italy is this style. Perfect texture to the dough, the sauce had spot on flavor, cheese was good too. I got a simple cheese pizza just to see what BEVO was all about. Bravo!

For my main I had the spinach and cream tortellini - so damn tasty, very well made. A little small, but for the kind of resto BEVO is and it's location I feel you're expected to have 3 courses here.

Next had the tiramisu, was delicious. Also had a berry mojito, which was my only small issue. 12$ a drink it maybe had half a shot of booze in there, but it was very very tasty.

I will 10000% come here every time I'm in Montreal now. Good job BEVO, you run a good resto."}
{"text":"My friend invited me here as part of the happening gourmand that's currently under way.

The place in located in old mtl, so I thought to myself is this one of those tourist trap joints? But it turns out it doesn't matter because we ate well and paid less so I'm happy I went.

We all ordered from the happening gourmand menu, which include entrée, main and dessert. For entrée I had portobello mushroom with asparagus with fontina sauce and fried calamari, then grilled veal and Osso buco  for mains and chocolate praline cake.

The portobello and asparagus were well done, with the sauce blend very well with everything. The fried calamari was also very nice, the meat was tender and the batter was light brittle and soft, it melted nicely as you bit into it.

The Osso buco was the best dish of the night, it was fall off the bone. It was served with a cheese risotto and top with a nice tomato sauce. The portion was huge but I couldn't stop eating it.

The veal was a bit dry and no sauce made it very boring to eat...

The chocolate cake was very rich, a bit on the sweet side, but you definitely feel the chocolate.

It was an exceptional menu for the price, 23-33$ depending on what extras you took. The quality of the food surprised it, I would definitely come back even without happening gourmand. They also have a pizza oven so can't wait to try that out."}
{"text":"I have never encountered such incompetent people in my life. The waitress was slow to begin with. Did not provide us with any insights on the menu. On top of this, as the night progressed she got too intoxicated to continue her duties as a waitress. A very classless act. If I were the manager, I would fire her as she insulted some of my friends. On top, the food left us sick the next day. Do not recommend. 5/10. And I'm giving 2 stars to be generous ;)"}
{"text":"La pizza était exquise, le cadre magnifique. C'est la première fois que je buvais du BON vin Californien. Je recommende chaudement ! Tout ça dans le vieux Montréal. Top"}
{"text":"BEVO is a great addition to the Old Port area of Montreal.  It is a great option when you are in the mood for some nice wood fired pizza.  I have only tried the pizza here, but they have a selection of other items as well.  The pizza choices are delicious.  My favorite however is the Saccense, which includes anchovies.  For dessert, they have a Nutella pizza, which is as amazing as it sounds.

The décor gives the place a warm feeling.  There is exposed brick and a red paint scheme.  The other great thing is they open late for some grub after drinking at night.  

I highly recommend this food destination."}
{"text":"Pizza - amazing! Even better - Nutella pizza for desert! WOW! The ambiance is great. I like the mix of bar / restaurant. I ordered the Margherita as I try and have at least one in every city I visit and so far this was one of the best I've had. But nothing beats the nutella pizza. The pizza crust with the nutella is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Fun, lively atmosphere.  We were seated on the second level so our table looked down on the bar area below.  The music was kind of loud, but not so much that it prevented conversation at our table.  (We saw two older couples leave together shortly after being seated and my suspicion was because of the music.  Just a warning to those of you seeking a quiet dinner!)

We were quite tired after a day of tourist-ing, so not in the mood for anything challenging.  Pizza for me, pasta for her.  Both were delicious.  Our server was very sweet and we had no trouble getting her attention at any time.  All-in-all, exactly what we were looking for.

We were very glad we found this place.  Thank you Montreal yelpers!"}
{"text":"Our second visit to Bevo and our friend's first. Myself and my fiancé shared the arancini to start. He had the gnocchi which was good, and I had a pizza with prosciutto and arugula, which was okay. Our friends had the calamari to start, which was a little pale and could have been fried longer, it wasn't crispy enough. They also had the meatball slider app which they raved about and was probably the star of the whole dinner. For mains, they had the tortellini and the pescatore pasta, both were good dishes. The tortellini was super rich and filling, so I thought the portion size was appropriate for that reason. The service was excellent! We sat in the bar and our server was very attentive and very kind. I also have to mention the bathrooms, because they were super clean and I'm kind of a stickler for that!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food is... weird.  I ordered a pancetta and arugula pizza.  It came as a pancetta pizza with a huge pile of raw arugula dumped on top.  I felt like I had to do some gardening in order to get to the pizza.  No cheese.  And then it cost 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Service: meh. Our water wasn't served until we asked and the waitress said there wasn't any glasses to use. 
The AC wasn't working and it was a very humid evening... 
My pizza was cold and something must've been undercooked because I woke up the next day with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Bohemian atmosphere and delicious pizza.  Loaded of your favorite toppings and family friendly."}
{"text":"I am from NYC  and no one has better pizza than in Brooklyn. This place belongs there! Loved everything I had!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here(visiting from NYC).  Amazing variety of pizza! Something for everyone. Excellent crispy crust and intricate topping combinations. The mushroom pizza with truffle is a favorite of ours. You just try the one with prosciutto. Fun place, great service!! Must try when in the area."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended we try out this restaurant for dinner. I heard rumors of Americans not being well-liked in Montréal, but so far in my trip, we had only experienced kindness from the locals... Until this place. 

Myself and three others let the host know we would like a table, he looked us over and said the wait would be long. We pointed out some empty tables and he said the upstairs area was closed. So we  pointed out some empty tables on the main level, then he said he was too busy to set those up for us... It became clear that he, for some reason did not want us there. Not sure if it was the American thing or because was are a mixed (racially) group. But it was completely rude, I hope people read this and give their business to the other establishments in the area."}
{"text":"\"Do you want me to be honest with you?\"   That's what the waitress asked us after she told us she could bring us the Martini's with Gargonzola Olives they had on the menu.  When she brought them with Olive's that weren't ripe, had pits, and were awful, we questioned what the deal was.  She also asked which Vodka (mine), & Gin (my friend) wanted and gave us the choices.  When she brought us the bill, (we decided we weren't staying if she had to give us the choice of honesty or not), the vodka & gin choices she gave us were additional to the already high price on the menu.  When questioned, she said the extra charge was for the alcohol.  Evidently, $14 Dirty Gorgonzola Martini's, neither include the Gorgonzola or alcohol.  I will never go back to this place and it's going on my Montreal black list.  Good job Nakkita, if that IS, your real name."}
{"text":"good atmosphere in old port, bread is great.
pizza is ok. little bit overpriced with wine everything...."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday night (830pm to 9pm) for a late dinner with a group of 14 people after we were exploring Old Montreal.  It was nice night so the patio was completely full but there a lot of empty tables inside.  I looked at the menu and was impressed at the pizza selection.  A similar restaurant in Toronto would be Pizza Libretto and BEVO has way more to choose from.  Once I saw Proscuitto, bocconcini and portobello pizza, it was a done deal.  Service was relatively quick at this time (but there weren't many tables inside) and they were attentive to us because we were a large group.  Pizza was delish!  The thin crust was in perfect balance with all the flavours and it wasn't too salty!  I wish we had a BEVO in Toronto.  Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I love the this place. Affordable prosecco. Delicious pizzas and pasta (and they have a nutella pizza). Gorgeous bar. Each time I went, the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Wow et Wow! Je me tanne jamais! Découvrez un restaurant situé dans le coeur du vieux Montreal, avec un des meilleurs chef à mon humble avis... Pour avoir essayé pas mal toute les pizzas et quelque plat de pasta! Ça vaut son pesant d'or! Une ambiance jeune et décontracte avec un service plus que parfait.. Seul en couple ou entre amis! Un endroit par excellence !"}
{"text":"In a city of excellent food, this spot has to be one of my favorites! Recommended by friends and having received a top rating in the \"Bitches Who Brunch\" blog, I was excited to try this place. We had the house salad (monstrous, lightly dressed, and fresh) as well as the arancino to start. The single giant rice ball was nicely fried and had a deep cheese flavor and great crunch. It was served with a superb meat sauce that was not the usual ground beef bolognese. This sauce was rich and substantial. It makes me want to go back to try the pasta dishes! Topped with a cute pile of micro greens, the arancini was both delicious and pretty.

The pizza was somewhere between a thin and thick crust with a delicious flavor and wonderful oven crunch. We added pepperoni to the basic marinara pizza. The pepperoni was richer and fuller tasting than most. It was also pleasantly spicy. Mmmmm!

The space is fun, the service is polite, and the food is good despite being in an area full of tourist spots of dubious quality. Try Bevo. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza you will find ANYWHERE. Can be a bit pricy for personal pizzas,  but was definitely worth it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My Friday night experience at this popular culinary destination was incredible. Not only is the decor visually appealing, but the DJ spinning tracks aside the bar set for a great date night atmosphere. The service from beginning to end was attentive, while our conversation remained uninterrupted throughout the night (except to deliver each course timely).

My wife and I are burrata aficionados, and the execution here was top notch. The cheese had the right balance between being creamy inside and slightly firm on the surface, and it was seasoned just right with cracked black pepper and sea salt. The verde salad and was a nice complement, and our waiter's recommendation to pair with their house tomatoes was well received.

I'm a huge fan of Neopolitano style pizza, and this pizzeria did the genre justice. Each ingredient was distinct and full of flavor, and every bite made it more clear that the meal was made from scratch.

This is one of those places where you're tempted to return the next evening. Swing by if you're in town."}
{"text":"Un grand restaurant avec beaucoup de places assises et une très belle architecture. La décoration ainsi que le style du restaurant sont très classes. Le bar propose divers cocktails, le vespa est un délice à essayer si on aime les cocktails plutôt sucrées!

En ce qui concerne la cuisine, les pizzas sont très très bonnes (nous n'avons pas goûté autre chose). Cependant, si vous commandez la pizza Bianco (champignons et truffes) faites bien attention qu'ils n'oublient pas de mettre la truffe. Personnellement nous avons du renvoyer notre pizza parce que la cuisine aurait \"oublié\" de mettre la truffe ...un peu bizarre, j'espère que ce n'est pas une pratique habituelle du restaurant pour économiser sur la truffe! 

Par contre le service est excellent, les serveurs et serveuses sont très agréables, polis, et attentionnés envers le client.  
Les prix sont abordables, cocktails entre 8-12$ à peu près, et les pizzas entre 14-21$, un bon rapport qualité prix en général !
Petite note: pensez à reserver avant de venir, surtout en été!"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal we decided to go here for a pizza,The location, decor were great and service was good. The waiter was friendly but when accidentally we broke a plate he didn't bring us a new one. Also they had an empty table when we arrived there but when we asked for a table at patio first they offered us a tall table set  under the lamp with a lot of flying things around it. 
Both appetizer and pizza were good but not excellent."}
{"text":"Somehow their reservation system lost a reservation even after an emailed confirmation. After calling to make a change, we learned that our reservation for 24 was non-existent. They didn't think they could accommodate the group, which could prove disastrous as people were coming from all over to join for dinner but told us to come and would find a way to accommodate us.  And when we arrived at the restaurant they still could not find our reservation that we had just called about 2 hours before.    But in the end with our reduced group of 12 they were able to accommodate us and we were glad to have the seating as the food was delicious and the wine was spot on. I would have given this review a 4 star as the food was that good. But the messing up of the reservation not once, but twice made this a 3 star experience."}
{"text":"This hip pizza and beer spot has a live DJ at the bar.  Pizzas are light and delicious. Staff is fantastic.  Be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...Mmm!  Place was so great we went here twice on our 4-day vacation to Montreal."}
{"text":"Came back to Montreal just for this place.  The pizza is exquisite; the spicy oil you can put on your pizza is awesome.  The atmosphere is also very cool, relaxed with a decent size bar.  We were a bit disappointed when we had to sit in the dining room because we wanted to watch the game.  They told us they had reservations coming; but we looked over a few times and the tables in the bar were still empty...Not sure what that was about.  Anyways you can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars but I can't. They were rude and disrespectful because of the age we were. They had two floors full of empty tables but said they were full. The hosts were RUDE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Bevo for dinner after reading several reviews. We were not disappointed. The service was fantastic, the food was very good, and the ambience was nice. The Osso Bucco was delicious. We would recommend Bevo if you are in Old Town."}
{"text":"JUST ATE HERE LAST night. their calamari was fried."}
{"text":"A short walk from my hotel in old Montreal.  This restaurant lived up to the reviews.  Started with sliders and I had a mushroom, cheese pizza (#2 on the list) and my associate had the ricotta stuffed pasta - we split and both were awesome.
Worth exploring.  Nice interior design, and the service was excellent.
Don't hesitate for a casual Italian dinner - this is your place!"}
{"text":"The resto is in a quaint area of old Montreal and perfect if you just want to relax outdoors while sipping on a draft beer or sharing a pitcher of Sangria. Food was below average for the price... but then again location is at a premium and this is in the heart of it all ! Sure bet for some drinks if you want to rub elbows with toutists but I'd go eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brick oven pizza was awesome. We're pretty selective about our pizza and BEVO really stands out. Service was attentive and friendly. Only complaint was that seating in the cool-looking section you see on the website was not open--more like a traditional pizza bar where we sat."}
{"text":"Came here for an office dinner and it was a nice restaurant. Chill atmosphere though it did get pretty loud at times. The calamari was ok, batter was too thick in my opinion. Lasagna was underwhelming. It was limp and the portion was pretty small for the price. I'm a small person and was still hungry after finishing it. If I were to come again, I think I'd go for the risotto or a pizza"}
{"text":"really good pizza with wood oven . the atmosphere is also nice, Will keep coming back :-)"}
{"text":"This place feels like a Montreal tourist trap mixed with tourists and some Montreal locals, though it' has a charming atmosphere. The food is very mediocre. We had the pizza which was pretty weak and the pasta which we could have done equally as well at home. If I was in the area and could't think of anywhere else to go to, I may try it again, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here because it was close to our hotel and our hotel recommended it. When we arrived around 8pm, it wasn't that busy; they had plenty of free tables. (We had a reservation anyway) The hostesses were nice and friendly and our server was also good. (Although I think she was a one-woman show and sometimes she was a bit busy managing all the tables)

We ordered calamari as an appetizer, which was good, and I got a pizza while my date got pasta. We shared and everything was solid and what you'd expect from a decent Italian place. We also got some gelato for dessert, which was good. The atmosphere inside is very hip and I'd recommend sitting in the dining area instead of by the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza; My friend and I ordered one for each of us. The pizzas are just bigger than personal ones (around maybe 12-13inches in diameter?) and we almost finished both of them. The restaurant itself has a really cool and trendy ambiance; definitely good for groups of friends (it was a little loud but hey).

And someone else mentioned this, but ask for the spicy oil! It's not super super hot, but more tangy with a bit of spicy. It's amazing with the meat based pizzas!

Okay selection of drinks. The waitstaff were so friendly as well and helped us pick from the selection that they had. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with even better service. It's like stepping into a family home with homemade food and your closest friends. The goat cheese pizza and Margarita pizza with their homemade chili sauce is fantastic. Save room for dessert - the Nutella pizza is brilliant."}
{"text":"Really nice place near the Old Port area in Montreal. This place ended up being off the main street where it was a nice big area for walking and outdoor cafes. Only about a block away, though. It itself had a nice outdoor seating area, but with seven people, they had difficulty accommodating us without a really long wait.

Everything else was fine. Good pizzas we had and others enjoyed the pastas they had."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff and friendly bartender. Got to know us and made the the type of drinks we were looking for"}
{"text":"Great italian food, great ambiance, great waitress / super nice services. We loved the entire experience there. The margarita pizza is quite something. Really taste like authentic italian food."}
{"text":"Eating at Bevo Bar and Pizzeria is like going to watch a big summer tent pole film, you're impressed with the trailers and then you're completely underwhelmed by the feature presentation.

The pros of the restaurant is that it has a nice decor, friendly staff though forgetful at times, and above average starters. My wife started with a fennel and orange pecan salad, it was adequate. I had the calamari which were solid but nothing to write home about.

The cons and this one is the big one. The main dish we chose to eat is the pizza, my God what a letdown. Why I wanted to go to this restaurant in the first place was because there pizzas were cooked in a wood burning oven. Their was such an uneven cook on the crust, part of it was burnt, while the other part was raw. Isn't pizza their bread and butter, how is it that they completely screwed up what their known for. Bottom line, one big disappointment. Live and learn, off to a better restaurant."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my evening out at Bevo.  I'm not normally a huge fan of the Old Port, too many tourists and everything is a little bit more expensive that it should be.  And then there's the fact that it's difficult for an Italian to go out for Italian food, it's never as good as the food your mom or grandma makes.

Bevo delivered!  We were a group of 8, and we were seated very comfortably.  Not too squished together, or too close to the other tables.  The space is quite nice and open.  We started out with beers and a bunch of shared appetizers.  They have a nice selection of both local and import draft beer, which always scores bonus points with me.  The sausage as part of the sausage and rapini dish was the closest I have tasted in restaurant to the sausage my parents make at home (and it's some good stuff!).  All the other apps were quite nice too, including the meat balls, the calamari and the seafood salad.

It's no secret I love pizza.  Cheap pizza.  Expensive pizza.  Fancy pizza. Cheese and carbs and toppings, I like it!  I tried the Emilia Romogna, intrigued by the meat raggu, and yum yum yum!  A really hearty and tasty pizza!  Was it as good as pizza I've had in Italy?  Maaaaaybe.  Was it some pretty good pizza!  Definitely!  Everyone else seemed to really love their pizza as well, whether it was a simple margherita pizza or a more involved pizza.

Bevo got more bonus points when at the end of the meal they brought out a dessert pizza for us to share, on the house!  It was exactly what it sounds like: nutella on a pizza base.  Simple and tasty. 

One thing that Bevo is missing is a good house wine, brought out in big carafes.  It's fine to offer a large wine list, but sometimes you just want an inexpensive and delicious wine to wash everything down, and you don't need a fancy bottle to do that.  A house blend would be perfect.

So overall, I will keep Bevo in mind the next time I want to have a nice yet casual dinner in the Old Port."}
{"text":"Was with friends and this place looked cool so we decided to try it. The bar looks amazing. Everything from the red glow to the bottles looked good. The prices are fair for a place like this. We had a good time chatting at the bar and lots of fun. Did not get a chance to try the food. Tip, don't get broken Arrow beer. It's pretty sour and bitter. The chocolate  mojito on the other hand was pretty good."}
{"text":"Average tasting Italian food.  We had the Caprese Salad, Calamari, and a pasta with pesto cream sauce.  Pasta was pretty good, but the calamari and salad were average.  Staff was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Twice I've been; and twice was amazing service! They're so friendly, and the food is really good! A bit over priced for the portion sizes, but over all good food. So worth i"}
{"text":"This place was great for our family of 3 kids! And was located off the touristy main street, which is good and still easy to get to.  There were kids at a lot of tables. Staff was friendly and entertained and engaged us and other kids with pizza tossing. They were accommodating with ordering requests (ie:Pasta with butter, no basil topping, etc) and our kids loved the food as the adults did too. Though we went on Thursday evening, where it was DJ night, and the music was loud! But, it drowned out our kid's noises!
I ordered the Veal Milanese, it was enjoyed by my son and me. The calamari was enjoyed by all my kids, real calamari (not the weird even rings you see served at some places). We also had the Rosato Penne with Proscuitto. The proscuitto was a bit hard, but the pink sauce was very nice. Margarita pizza was delicious and enjoyed by my child. I was expecting it with round slices of mozzarella, but they used shredded and looked like a new york pizza. Also, had the beet salad and was delicious, big appetizer portion. They asked if we wanted goat cheese and we agreed without realizing it was additional cost until the bill came. Nevertheless, it as still delicious 
We would go back!"}
{"text":"After reading all the awesome reviews about this place, I was super excited to come to Bevo for a birthday party last night. I informed the hubby that we were not to have dinner because we were going to have the best pizza of life instead (even though waiting for dinner till 11pm is painful).. We were looking forward to it so much so that we told the people sitting our table about these amazing reviews. Needless to say, when the pizzas came, we were extremely excited. As soon as I took that first bite of my mushroom pizza, my face fell. What?? THIS is the amazing pizza?? Pizza Bravo in NYC makes pizza way better than this.. Geppetto on Notre Dame makes better pizza... Oh, the disappointment...... There was really nothing to the pizza. I thought it was just mine, but when I tried hubby's Capricosa I felt the same. People at the table who tried our pizzas said the same. Oh, the sadness.. This is what I starved myself for? Absolutely not worth it. 

Drinks were nice and strong - I stuck with a blood orange Cosmo the entire night (and by 'a', I really mean 3 or 4.. Lost count :p) while my hub experimented with the berry mojito (not good), the chocolate martini (not the best I've tried but not horrible), and the old fashion (not my style but he liked it). Two pizzas and 6/7 drinks later, our bill was $100.. So I'd say that the prices are decent for the Old Port.. 

Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I'll be generous and round up to 4. Cool ambiance, fast service, good drinks, decent prices, and meh food..hmmm I think I should press submit before I change my mind and round down! :)"}
{"text":"Des pizzas à pâte fine, des entrées à l'italienne aussi délicieuses à l'oeil qu'en bouche, des portions plus que généreuses. J'ai passé un bon moment dans une atmosphère assez détendue et un fonds musical qui m'a bien plue. Ma petite découverte, ils offrent même de la bière sans alcool. ;) Tout pour passer une excellente soirée. Je reviendrai."}
{"text":"I love wood-fired pizzas, so when I finally took the time to visit Bevo, I had to try one of theirs, I ordered the Bosco in Bianco which is composed of roasted mushrooms, mozzarella and black truffles with a pitcher of sangria.

We were seated on the terrace, but let's say that sangria and fine weather brings not so friendly wasp so we had to ask to be seated inside. The waitress gave us excellent service and even offered us a cocktail of her own creation, which was very very good."}
{"text":"Sometimes in life, you have experiences that change your life forever. Saturday night Feb 13th 16 at BEVO was one of those nights. As I glanced to the bar, I saw a man who looked like he was in his own world. He had an great energy and was DJing for the restaurant. The music selections were perfect and matched the energy of the place almost too well. Our party was so moved by his silky smooth beats we bought him a few drinks during the course of the evening. The purposeful yet appropriate first pumps, dance moves and spins were the icing on top. He literally made our night.

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an audiophile. This DJ delivers!

PS- We didn't get the djs name, but he wore a baseball cap with a \"T\" on it. So we nicknamed him DJ T"}
{"text":"Casual dressy place in Old Port offering steak, pasta, pizza. Mostly a pizza/pasta place and their pizzas are usually recommended but I was not feeling pizza that day so went for Veal shank plate with tomato sauce and risotto. It was so good. I am a sucker for tangy tomato flavours in general so this was a win anyway. But for optimum experience, I used their chili sauce (usually meant for pizza) to complement the subtlety of tomato. The meat was tender and risotto was perfect. The portion did justice to its price, I was over filled. I would actually suggest charging less and reducing the portion size because an overwhelming serving can reduce the enjoyment from flavours. I also tried my friend's pizza which was mind blowing; going to try the pizza there next time."}
{"text":"What a find! Perfect pizza, Bloody Caesar and rose. Wine. Sitting outdoors on a sunny day under the awning was lovely. 

Crispy crust, prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms and rocket, the perfect pie. Open brick pizza oven cooked to perfection!

Inside is very smart, well designed and great upstairs."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I went to during my short visit to Montreal.

I ordered the meatball sub and it was crazy good, so good in fact I came by the next night and ordered it again! I also got the chocolate martini which was delicious.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant, it's a fun place to go with comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Markup on California wines is absurd. Can't speak to the other wines on their list but they get the lowest quality California wines and then charge WAY more markup than other restaurants. We ordered an Italian wine just so we wouldn't know how badly we were being ripped off. 

We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto. What we were served was a pizza with like 4 mushroom pieces and HAM!!! We brought this to the waiter's attention and he went to talk to the chef. The chef sent him back out with a plate that had both prosciutto and ham on it, and he informed us that yes, the prosciutto-looking stuff on the plate was, in fact, prosciutto, but that the ham on the plate was just \"another type of prosciutto\". If \"prosciutto for suckers\" is a type of prosciutto, then I guess he's right!

To their credit, they didn't charge us for the pizza, but overall it ended up being an incredibly overpriced and mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Very neat atmosphere with awesome decor. Service was good, though maybe not as quick as would be expected from how busy they were at the time. Food was good and we thoroughly enjoyed it, however, I would not say it was anything particularly exceptional, especially for the price. We did really enjoy the Nutella pizza we ordered for dessert. It was simple (just pizza dough, Nutella, and icing sugar) but the dough was really nice. Overall, we very much enjoyed our experience though it wasn't particularly unique or out of this world."}
{"text":"The food was good but it is not children friendly. No kids menu nor simple apple juice."}
{"text":"Le staff était gentil, mais aucun moyen d'avoir une table a l'intérieur sans réservation très d'avance. On a pris un table sur la terrasse, c'était bien mais trop frisquet à mon goût. J'ai pris un vin rouge avec les gnocchi bolognaise. Le vin était très bon, les gnocchi aussi mais la portion était trop petite a mon goût, surtout pour le prix."}
{"text":"I came here back in September - Labor Day weekend to be exact - and the place was popping!

It was full of people enjoying their dinner and drinks. Their outdoor seating area is huge and the decor inside was beautiful. It's a mix of industrial, rustic, and sultry. Very cool.

Service was awesome from the hostess to the bartender and ending with our waiter. Food was OK but the drinks were good."}
{"text":"The cucumber cocktail was awesome as well as the meatball appetizer. We were excited to see how the pizza was going to taste. We ordered the mushroom pizza and the prosciutto and arugula one. I'm sad to say the prosciutto pizza was dry! It had no sauce and no flavor. We were terribly disappointed, but I have to say our server was super nice."}
{"text":"I love the pizza baked in a wood fired oven and it was refreshing to see a sit down restaurant with a decent beer selection.  That would be all great but this place is ridiculously loud and they have essentially no ventilation or air conditioning.  While eating at Bevo, you'll have the joy of experiencing what the pizza must feel in that wood fired oven down there."}
{"text":"I came here while in town on my \"mini-moon\".  Being from Chicago, I was reluctant to have pizza in Montreal but I LOVED the outdoor ambiance so I agreed.  The food was fantastic but the outdoor ambiance is worth grabbing some wine/apps if you're looking to dine in Old Montreal on a warm night."}
{"text":"Great pizza! This place is pretty big so you don't have to wait for a table. The pizza was delicious and there were so many options! The wine was also great. Cassandra was very attentive and helpful with suggestions. Later at night it also turns into a good bar for going out at. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic as well as the calamari.  Our waitress was also very friendly. 
 
The bartender woman with the black hair was incredibly rude.  She was insulting and sarcastic with every interaction.  It took a very long time for her to acknowledge us, first of all.  Then, when I asked her what kind of ports she had, she responded that if I didn't know what I wanted, she was going to give me the most expensive drink she had.  Later, she grabbed the credit card machine from me and asked how much I was tipping her. I wish we hadn't stayed for after-dinner drinks because it ruined a great night."}
{"text":"Mama told me never to talk with my mouth full. So this is going to be short and sweet.

There are few restaurants in our beautiful city that actually know how to make Pizza. Like, REALLY make pizza. The way it should be made. The way it's made in Italy.
Bevo is one of them.

Let's just say that while stuffing my pretty little face, I was anything but a lady. And using the excuse \"where I come from we eat it with our hands\" didn't quite have the desired effect. Rather, Mr. Haze just rolled his eyes, and ducked his head out of sight of confused neighbouring tables. To summarize: the sauce is outstanding, the cheese is amazingly fresh mozzarella and it's so perfectly thin... the piece de resistance, the wood-burning oven- what a beaut.

DO NOT get me started on the Nutella pizza (I ate the whole thing to myself). There is nothing, NOTHINGGGG better. Ideal mixture of salty and sweet, and gooey and crispy, and chocolate and bread, and ... and... and..

Looking back I could tell you that the service was beyond friendly and attentive, that the music was rockin', that the crowd was good lookin' and that it had a great post-dinner party vibe. But last night, at exactly 9:37 pm, none of that mattered, it was just me and my Pizza Pie all alone in that big ol' restaurant. THAT'S AMORE."}
{"text":"Great patio and pizza located on a cute side street in downtown Montreal. They had good beer on tap and yummy sangria! Service was excellent with a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chaque fois que je me rends à un restaurant au centre-ville ou dans le Vieux-Port, je me demande s'il s'agit d'un attrape-touriste... J'ai bien souvent peur d'être déçue et de payer trop cher pour ce que les plats sont en réalité. Un soir, en allant faire une course, je suis passée devant le BEVO et j'ai été tout de suite attirée par l'odeur qui s'en dégageait. Puis, j'ai regardé à l'intérieur pour découvrir un endroit vraiment magnifique.

Une semaine plus tard, après avoir réservé, je me rends au BEVO avec une amie. Quelle malchance, on nous apprend que tout le système informatique du restaurant (commandes et paiements) ne fonctionne plus depuis quelques minutes. La gentille hôtesse nous propose quand même de nous installer sur la terrasse et de voir si nous voulons attendre que le bogue se règle. Notre très sympathique serveur nous informe que le restaurant a eu l'autorisation de prendre les commandes à la main, mais que le service risque d'être très très ralenti. Puisque nous ne sommes pas pressées, nous décidons de rester. Pour faire une histoire courte, malgré tout, nous avons reçu nos assiettes à peine 20 minutes après avoir commandé...Wow! Ce n'est pas ce que j'appelle un service ralenti! Nous avons donc pu partager un délicieux risotto et une excellente pizza, en plus de déguster un rafraîchissant Chardonnay et ce, à un prix très raisonnable! Le service a été courtois tout au long de la soirée. Finalement, le bogue informatique a été réglé et nous avons pu régler nos additions après un agréable moment. 

Côté bruit, j'ai remarqué que c'était assez bruyant dans le restaurant, mais beaucoup plus calme sur la terrasse. Pour ceux à qui ça ne pose pas problème, vous adorerez! En plus, le décor de l'endroit est hyper joli. Le restaurant compte 2 étages alors il peut accueillir beaucoup de monde. Je crois que ça pourrait être une excellente option pour un souper d'anniversaire ou un événement du genre. Côté menu, on retrouve plusieurs entrées, plats principaux (pâtes, risottos, pizzas au four à bois, etc.) et vins. Les prix sont très raisonnables!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza there  (thin pizza freshly cooked). I find it affordable especially for a restaurant near the oldport. I would definitely come back for pizza if I am around there."}
{"text":"My favourite pizzeria in Montreal! Fun ambience, cool looking crowd & food is amazing, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I first heard of Bevo at the Mac oyster and blood Caesar no night - Boris go served amazing charcuterie at the event.

With pizzafest opener- it was only appropriate to come here! The terasse was beautiful for a September evening. We ordered a pitcher of white Sangria**** that had a pineapple juice base (doo different and refreshing) ; for the main course I had bosco in Bianco pizza**** (black truffle, mushrooms and mozzarella) garnished with Parmesan -my stomach screamed Bellisimo! The service was impeccable - thank you Kayla!!! 

Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great venue for food, ambience and people.
The drinks are nothing special but food is exquisite!
Definitely worth going. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Bevo surprised me!

It was a bit more than I thought it was going  to be! 

We got the Calamari to start which, was surprisingly very fresh and perfectly done! We had the Rosay sauce pasta and the pizza, which also turned out to be better than anticipated! The pasta was done perfectly and the pizza was nice and toasty! I though the pizza could've used a bit more flavor but overall, no complains!

It would have been a 4 star rating but have to knock it down 1 star due to the fact we were there for their Burrata and Truffled pizza and they didn't have either! Huge let down but understandable as it was Canada Day long weekend!"}
{"text":"Pasta was delicious but portion was small. Pizza lived up to expectations (pizzeria afterall). Our waitress was very friendly and tried to answer all of our touristy questions."}
{"text":"Went there for a date night Friday. Nice loungy atmosphere with a great live DJ but conversation was still very much possible. The restaurant has 2 floors, and there is enough space between tables that you don't feel like you're eating your neighbour's dinner. 

Waitstaff is very attentive but leave you your space (no pressure for ordering, or eating quickly), and are always sure to fill up your glass whether water or wine. The prices are quite good given the location and quality of the food. The food was very fresh and delicious! We ordered the mixed olives, caprese salad and margherita pizza with arugula, as well as sharing a bottle of prosecco. I would very highly recommend. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here after checking-in at my hotel, so I was a bit tired and hungry having flown all day. I like pizza (ok, love pizza - all formats, be it thin crust wood fired to deep dish Chicago) and Italian so having read reviews was optimistic this would make me feel better. And it did. I had the meatballs as an appetizer and salame pizza. Both were great, I just wish I had had room for their Nutella pizza for dessert. I guess it's just an excuse to go back."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a place close to me just to have fast lunch and I'm absolutely happy this pizzeria was the closest! The margarita pizza was soooooo good! Maybe the best pizza I've ever tried! And stuff is so friendly! A waitress made a list for me which parts of city to visit , when I told her that I'm a tourist! I will definitely come back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a few other pizza hotspots were totally full, but my friend and I were totally satisfied and pleased. I was craving some authentic pizza badly, and got exactly what I wanted. I ordered the Prosciutto e Cotto (prosciutto cotto, bocconcini, mozzarella, tomato sauce and portobello), and I can guarantee it is now a favourite! I've been raving about how amazing it was all night and day. They have a good wine selection too, I had a glass of their Toscana red (first on the list, can't remember it's full name), my friend had a glass of their white Chardonnay.

Considering it was a Saturday night in Old Montreal, it was definitely loud and packed, as expected. Keep in mind this is a Restaurant & BAR. With a few bachelorette parties going on, it was quite the funny sight as well. With a beautiful summer breeze, the windows were wide open and we had a lovely view of Saint-Vincent and passers-by.

I'd definitely come back, the low star-rating does this restaurant no justice, I hope that changes!"}
{"text":"Très sympa et chaleureux comme endroit! les prix sont un peu chers mais la qualité est là et le service est très bon"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. My husband and I checked out Yelp while in Old Port and noticed this place had great ratings. We came by shortly after the opened and although it was empty whwn we got there, it was almost packed when we left and I know why. The pizza was delicious, the service was great and the restaurant itself is pretty nice itself. I would go back if I lived here but I'm visiting and refuse to go the the same place twice :P"}
{"text":"Really romantic setting right in the middle of Old Montreal. The pasta was delicious. We also ordered a Margherita pizza to share and loved that, too. Go now!"}
{"text":"My partner and I arrived to Montreal early May 2017 for a 5 day stay (partly business and partly pleasure).  We stayed in the Old Port area which is historic and beautiful.

Being vegetarians and foodies, we not only desire food that is meat-free, but we seek micronutrients, primarily in the form of vegetables.  Salads are fine and we do eat them, but we also like to eat copious amounts of vegetables.  They are not a garnish for us, they are the center of our meals.  This requirement is not easily met in certain cities and/or countries.  As wonderful as French food is, it can be difficult to eat anything short of a salad, potatoes (assuming they are not cooked in animal fat) or possibly another starchy option, like 3 small raviolis in a cream sauce on the appetizer menu.  Not criticizing, just stating the reality.  Hence, we seek restaurants that can meet our needs and sometimes, as was the case this time, become a bit redundant by eating at the same restaurant repeatedly.

We found Bevo on both Tripadvisor and Yelp.  Then, as it turned out, our hotel staff told us it was a part of the same ownership group as themselves and also recommended it.

Although we found no separate vegetable section on the menu, I saw that some of their meat options came with spinach so I figured they would be willing to create a side of spinach for us.  They were in fact accommodating and it was large and delicious - photo attached.  During our 4 dining experiences there, we also ordered the tagliatelle with tomato sauce, tagliatelle with mushrooms and truffles (not on the menu) and white pizza with mushrooms and truffles.  We also ordered the arugula salad w/shaved parmesan and the burrata which came with tasty grilled crostini.  We kept meaning to take photos but unfortunately, we jumped right in and by the time we thought of it, plates were half full.  The one thing we captured before digging in was an order of the side of spinach (likely to only excite other veg-heads like us).  I will attach it.  Others have posted those things we ordered with the exception of the custom pasta with mushrooms and truffles.

Also, the staff was especially lovely.  A special shout out to to our servers in order of our 4 meals there: Alexi, Sophie, Cynthia and Cassandra.  All 4 were accommodating, warm and attentive.  We also very much enjoyed our chats with the hostess Martina and other staff that gravitated towards us and chatted us up (we generally went to eat at 1600 so the restaurant was not yet busy).  Some of those we met and enjoyed were: Yanni and Billy and although we only waved and received a wink from Mathieu, the chef, we appreciated him for his skill, flexibility and talent.  All those we spoke with expressed either directly or indirectly, their enthusiasm working there and expressed positive feelings towards those who employ them.  One even stated, \"It's a very good group to work for.\"  That feeling of goodness came through so evidently in their attitudes and professionalism which seemed effortless.  We really enjoyed everything - the food, ambiance, staff and again, the flexibility.  

Dear Bevo and the \"Group\" who employs - job well done.  Your employees are happy and therefore they make the clients happy.  What ever you're doing, it's working."}
{"text":"The perfect definition of a touristic trap... Overpriced, the size of the meals is a joke... Terrible service, I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for a weekend trip and decide last minute on Bevo. It was a Saturday night and we called around 8pm and they were friendly and accommodating in getting us a reservation despite being busy. The decor is old world meets new world with minimalist sitting pods by the bar and exposed brick throughout the restaurant. The upstairs seating area is gorgeous, but we didn't make it up there. Ordered the prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan pizza and was not disappointed! The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. The music was loud and I noticed a very high female to male ratio, but there might have been an event going on. This place is not overrated - I'm a New Jersey native whose lived in New York and this is seriously good pizza. Bravo Bevo."}
{"text":"Good spot for dinner, nice outdoor seating. Everything is very good, but not quite 5 star level. Try the beet and pear salad for sure, and the calamari are also very good, very lightly battered and not over-fried."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved! The service was great & the margherita pizza was delicious! We also really liked the atmosphere. Very comfortable."}
{"text":"We went for supper on a Saturday night to celebrate my friends birthdays. I had a Martini Lychee and it was great! I had the house meatball slider, the meat ball was so tender and the tomato sauce was just delicious! They bring 2 sliders of an average side and I shared it with one of my friends. I also ordered a pizza for my main dish and it was really big, definitely to share with a friend also. I ordered a cotto e bocincini pizza which was really tasty, the only thing is I asked the waiter if this was the dry prosciutto and he said yes but it was prosciotto cotto which I know now is like thinly sliced ham. It was loud though because of the music so the waiter might have misheard me. Overall it was really great the only thing is we were a lot of people and at the end when some of us were still paying one of the waitresses started separating the tables which kind of felt like were were being pushed out and it was around 1am but they close at 2am."}
{"text":"One more restaurant for the event of Happening Gourmand! This is my 3rd time at Bevo! I still love this place! Beautiful brick walls; medieval chandeliers; vibrant atmosphere, and great music choices for the background.

Excellent service. Our server was enthusiastic, funny and helpful. He has excellent choices of recommendations. 

The food was unbelievably amazing. Started with a glass of white Pinot Grigio (my favorite). My calamari was perfect due to excellent spicy marinara sauce. Bosco in Blanco is my favorite pizza due to sliced truffle. My desert was tiramisu; it was really too sweet for my taste but thankfully it was a small one. 

I always enjoy this place... can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend, amazing staff, amazing food and pitcher of red sangria was delicious. Definitely worth the price for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great location .  Very nice inside as well as outside.
The pizzas and pasta were superb.
Great service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the spinach and ricotta tortellini and loved it! My fiancé and I also shared the margherita pizza. I've tasted brick oven pizzas at other restaurants, but this was one of my favorites. They also had a drink menu (my fiancé and I just wanted water) but it seems like they had a great selection of wines, spirits, and cocktails. Overall, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The waiter spilled a drink on me to start. Most people would freak out \"Oh no! My sleeve is wet! Ah!\" I'm a cool dude though so it was no big deal. Still, the waiter comped the drink and brought out a free antipasto plate for the table. Food was out of this world, cocktails were great and upstairs was lively with great music. At the end, they also brought a free Nutella pizza as well, due to the aforementioned spill incident. We were all full at that point but still managed to finish most of it because it was delicious. All and all great experience."}
{"text":"Incredible. From the atmosphere to the service and the food - nothing missed here. Some people in Quebec get bratty if you don't speak French fluently, but not here. They were more than welcoming to English speakers and the servers were also helpful in making recommendations about the menu.

The saffron risotto balls are not to be missed and could be a meal in and of itself - so huge and also amazingly tasty. The pizza - just get the salami. If you like salty and you like meat, there is no question. I think this might be my first review using balls, salty and meat in the same paragraph! And, I'm leaving it so even more testament to how fantastic BEVO is. 

You have to sit in the hanging chairs. They are really cool. 

Will be back to bring my husband for sure!"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal. First restaurant here and it was a good choice. Food took s little long but they are busy and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very nice food and service. Pizza was delicious. 
Definitely coming back here again. Best to check reviews of all the restaurants first before going. This place is excellent"}
{"text":"I saw this place online and figured must try when I go visit Montreal. Friday night was pretty busy, however we were quickly seated and served. The waiter was kind though out the entire time. Excellent service. The food was delicious, enjoyed they pizza with this spicy sauce they give you on the side, a must have. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"La pizza y est tout simplement excellente !!! Et l'équipe aussi ! 
Seul petit problème l'ambiance un peu trop club le soir mais ça n'enlevé rien au cachet de la bâtisse !! 
Je recommande, peut être à essayer le midi !?"}
{"text":"Must try place in the old port where locals and tourists go.

Nice terrasse in the summer. Good music and ambiance. Pizzas are amazing, the pasta selection is also good."}
{"text":"Great place to come with kids.   When we were in Montreal, kids begged to eat here twice.  There must be better options around Montreal, but my kids to love this place.   Their pasta dishes must be really good.  My little one finished the adult portion.    I would say the portions are on the small side.   I had their Osso Bucco, which I would not recommend.  I am giving four stars because of my kids.  They just love eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and drinks, although it's not the spot for a \"date night\" it was great food! Service was somewhat slow, but then again we went on a very busy Sunday night."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family while on vacation for a few days in Old Montreal and was somewhat disappointed with my experience. The ambiance was chic but unpretentious, and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so we were seated quickly.

Service was only fair - our food was prepared quickly but it took a long time for our waitress to check in with us, which only happened once or twice during out dinner.

We shared a risotto ball appetizer, which was tasty but went quickly for three people. For entrees, we ordered a seafood scampi, chicken supreme, and pasta dish with ricotta and crushed tomatoes. The scampi was fairly good, but the seafood was chopped into tiny bits and it was hard to differentiate scallops from shrimp from whatever else might have been chopped up and added in. The tomato based sauce also did quite mesh with the fish flavored in the dish. The pasta dish was okay but lacked flavor and seasoning. The tomato sauce tasted pretty much liked crushed tomatoes from a can with no seasoning, and there didn't seem to be much cheese. The chicken supreme looked completely unappetizing and wasn't as advertise at all. Rather than an herb-crusted chicken breast with a side of asparagus, it was a huge chunk of bone-in chicken (with skin and no herbs or crust to speak of) over a bed of whatever green stuff they had laying around the kitchen - a mix of flavorless green beans, spinach stalks, and 2-3 stalks of asparagus.

Additionally, for the quality of food and service we received, we grossly overpaid - the entrees seemed super overpriced (even accounting for the exchange rate from USD to CAD) and weren't particularly tasty.

Overall, this place was just decent and a tad overpriced. We all agreed that we would not make an effort to return here, particularly with all of the other food options in the Old Montreal area."}
{"text":"Bah!
Bah I say!
What a disappointing dinner we had last night.
Why oh why did I decide to try their pasta?
Their bolognese sauce tastes worse than pre-made store bought stuff,
hell it might be that stuff just not heated up properly, who knows?
So thick (as in: tomato paste consistency), so flavourless, so lukewarm. 
Oh and they need to clean their espresso machine filter.
The pizza was still good, so at least there's that."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say. Delicious pizza, good beer, reasonable prices. And if you're looking for something sweet, the Nutella pizza is great as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Loved the pizza - including the slight charring from the wood fired stove (I think others have considered the lovely charring as \"burned\"). Our 6 yr old was entranced watching the pizza making - good for her and gave us some quiet time too. The gnocchi with sauce on side was a kid-meal hit. Adults enjoyed the penne with rose sauce and pancetta and a pizza with more pancetta and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Please note: My rating was bumped down purely based on the Service, which ruined the entire dining experience.

We arrived for an early dinner at around 5:30pm, to an almost completely empty restaurant. Upon review of our jeans and sneakers (too casual apparently), we were asked if we had a reservation. Since we did not, we were told we could be seated in the bar area, despite the entire first floor of tables open. Not only were we seated in the corner, but under the staircase by the cleaning supplies. It felt that all non-local dinners were seated in the corner. 

The food was average pasta and Italian dishes, with the pasta seeming to be purchased and not made in house. 

For my next visit to Montreal, I will definitely be skipping this restaurant which discriminates against tourists."}
{"text":"Simple yet tasty food. Very friendly server, great service and excellent recommendations. Thank you very much Giancarlo....greatly appreciated. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yo Bevo, I'm giving you two stars. If this review is too harsh, please keep in mind that it is being  written on the toilet, your $25 pizza forcibly removing itself from my body. 


The place is nice, excellent ambience, and initially I was completely happy with the meal. This feeling of satisfaction deserted me as soon as the food arrived. Not only was my pizza not what I ordered, it was completely mediocre. I would have complained, but I was in a professional  setting and didn't want to make a fuss. The crust was dry, and totally flavourless. Toppings meh.  I found myself wishing I was in another place, eating another pizza. I also wished that my bill wasn't $25. 


I came home unsatisfied, knowing I wasn't going to return. I wouldn't have cared enough to write this review if the experience hadn't stayed with me. I'm fairly confident that your pizza is responsible for my gastrointestinal distress as others had exactly what I ate that day minus what I ordered."}
{"text":"This place was awful!!! 20+ tables open and they wouldn't seat my party and I!!! The hostesses were so rude and had such terrible attitudes!!!"}
{"text":"Great al fresco dining for summertime crowds, attentive service, fresh offerings including penne alla vodka (which they call alla Rusia), antipasto and good wine selection. It beats the poutine restaurant across the street hands down, especially if you want to preserve the health of your coronary arteries."}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review off by saying I hate giving bad reviews. Rarely do I ever see the need to give a place such a negative review. The one star is because one appetizer was half decent and the server removed one item off our bill that was inedible. 

We were seated in the bar area, which was extremely bright, red lights illuminating from the bar, irritating to the eyes. It was not a pleasant dining experience. Loud club music played throughout the restaurant and the volume greatly increased at 7pm. 

Our server was quick to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a while before returning to take our dinner orders. 

Once our food arrived we did not see our waitress for a long period of time while we sat with empty water glasses. The gentleman at the table next to us actually  went to the bar to refill his water. 

As for the food..we ordered 2 appetizers (beet & pear salad and the arancini) and two pizzas (margarita and mushroom with prosciutto). 

The beet and pear salad was under seasoned, if seasoned all. The arancini was the best item we had. The bolognese sauce had good flavor however the risotto cake was dry and spongy. 

The crust of the margarita pie was cooked well. The mushroom\prosciutto bottom so so badly burnt it left a terrible bitter taste in our mouth. It was inedible and our server took off of our bill.  

When it was time to pay, it took an awful lot of time for the server to bring our bill over (15-20 minutes at least) and she was nowhere to be found.  When she finally appeared she apologized for being absent for the duration of our meal and hoped we enjoyed our visit. We wished her a happy new year and she responded by saying, \"Yeah, happy fucking new year\"."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel, BEVO was just what we needed. Delicious food, helpful staff and lovely setting outside. My friend and I had the gnocchi and the pizza with sundried tomatoes. Neither disappointed. They also had a nice selection of beers I had not had before. Our waiter allowed me to try a few different ones to help me decide."}
{"text":"Pizza is well worth the visit! Excellent service and attention from the staff.  Try the truffle pizza - doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza. I've had pizza in Italy and throughout Europe but this place rivaled them all. Cute outdoor eating area and delicious food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on yelp and since we were pretty desperate for dinner, we gave it a try. I had the best meal! Their penne in rose sauce with prosciutto and mushroom is heaven! Pizza is oven baked too! Nice environment, will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped by Old Montreal for a night and went to Yelp to find a place to eat. We were steered to Bevo because of the great reviews (and because hubby loves pizza) and we were not disappointed. We came around 8:30 on a Saturday night and, judging by all the full tables, were expecting to have a wait but were happy when we were seated right away. 

For apps, we ordered the calamari, which was cooked and salted perfectly. Also, the waiter recommended that we try the Arancino (risotto ball with meat sauce). So good! Wish we ordered one to take home. 

For an entree, we shared a pizza. Note that these are 10-inch, 4-slice pizzas so they are okay to share if you have appetizers, but not otherwise. We had the pizza with prosciutto, portobello mushrooms, and mozzarella. Delicious! And that's coming from New Yorkers! 

For drinks, the old-fashioned is good and strong, if you're into bourbon. Try the berry mojito, if you want a cocktail. I also had a prosecco Sangria, which tasted similar to a mimosa but with a kick. 

Overall, we loved the ambiance of Bevo. There was a variety of age groups here and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Seems to be a good place for groups - as we saw a bachelorette party and a birthday party being celebrated here. Also, they played great music!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice location. Looks like it is a bar and restaurant all in one. The pizza is pretty good. Some of the people in my party had pasta which they also enjoyed. Plenty of seating area inside and out as well as upstairs. Service was not the greatest: one waitress very friendly, another barely attended us."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I ordered seafood pasta (although they have fancy names for it) - just ordinary taste. Not bad, not perfect. 
What I was disappointed about is the service. Waitresses refilled my water just once, didn't pay attention, and I waited like 15 mins before they charge me, nevertheless I left tips"}
{"text":"We had just arrived in town and were hungry and exhausted from our road trip. BEVO Bar + Pizzeria was conveniently located down the street from our hotel we thought it would be a great start to our stay in Montreal to check out a local restaurant vs. hotel food. Our party consisted of 6 people and we were seated immediately upstairs (no wait? yay!). It wasn't a busy night, but somehow it took our server 15-20 min to take our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we had to wait another hour or so to place our order - ordered several appetizers, 3 salads and 4 pizzas. When we received our pizza some were COLD... I assume they were ready for a while, but no one to bring them to us. Overall our food was okay nothing out of the norm - I would have returned though minus the horrible service and in-laws cold pizzas. 

Our server was taking shots with the table next to us, most of the party had circus soleil attire - assuming they worked for the circus. I don't know if it's customary to drink on the job here and honestly I don't care, but attend to paying customers. Done with our food, drinks and water cups on empty we waited for well over 30 minutes to get our check. Our server was gone, I proceeded downstairs to waive someone and I see our server hanging out in the bar. REALLY?!?! At this point I ask for the manager and request my bill. Manager gives me the bill and it read over $2,300.00!!!! Canadian currency or not that was a HUGE mistake! If I hadn't noticed he would have swiped my card. I immediately had him fix the issue and he profusely apologized. 

Overall food was nothing out of the ordinary to have to put up with an intoxicated server and lack of customer service. Literally we lost 3.5 hours of our time!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and the reviews were mixed. I am only commenting on MY food and drink since that's what I actually experienced.

We started off with caprese salad. The cheese was amazing, soft, and just perfect. I would have preferred a bigger piece of basil with each tomato but that is a personal choice. The cheese makes this dish and it made it well.

We also had a risotto with cheese and meat sauce to start. I was hesitant since I'm not a risotto fan but this was good....so good my 4 year old was asking for more. Perfect mix of all flavors.

I had a Bellini to drink and while it was great it was $11 for such a small portion. I would have rather spent the money to get a \"bigger\" drink like a Caesar.... Didn't stop me from drinking 2 though!

My main meal was a Salame Pizza (basically a fancy way of saying pepperoni! I liked it. The pizza was thin crust, well cooked and the pepperoni had a bit of a kick to it. I didn't finish it because I was full with the apps and drinks.

The service was very attentive and the decor of the place was great. The bathrooms needed attention though. The stall with no lock had toilet paper and the stall with a lock was paperless.... 

Overall I really did enjoy the food and service and would go back for a girls night or date night."}
{"text":"I had the arancini and a margarita Pizza, both were good. I would go again and recommend Bevo if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Amazing wood fired pizza. They have red chilis they give and they taste delicious on the pizza. The kids and adults loved this place. Our server Gian Carlo was the best!!"}
{"text":"Relatively speaking, it's good pizza. Nice atmosphere and good service. Think it's over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a wood fired pizza in the Old Port of Montreal.

We visited the place on a Tuesday night so not really super busy but busy enough that it did not seem we were the only ones there.

The menu is broad enough to make everyone happy and typical of Montreal an interesting wine and beer list.

Pricing is reasonable and may seem a bargain for this neighborhood

Service was attentive but the server doesn't really know too much about what they are serving.

I like to ask questions about the pizza oven, the process or even wine ideas or even trying to decode the actual pizza menu. She failed in all cases but her smile and positive attitude still won us over.

My buddy was shocked when the pizza arrived a few minutes later. Well yeah a 950 degree oven SHOULD kick a pizza out in a 2 minutes upon toppings placed for a real pompei oven.

So many places claim wood fired but the wood is nowhere to be found

Great job with a flavourful thin crust and a gently charred and crisp edge

There are multiple floors so I can only imagine on busy nights the place could be jumping and I prefer always eating my pizza facing the oven and watching the activity at work"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service made it a real special experience for us. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and wanted to eat some good food and have a great time.

The ambience is top notch and service was spot on, the food and drinks were amazing.

Keep it up."}
{"text":"Great pizza ( we had mushroom one with truffles) . Caprese salad was fresh and yammy. However service was not all there. Servant kept on forgetting everything. Whiskey shots were tiny( enough for one sip ) . But just for pizza and beer it's good! Open late too."}
{"text":"Nice interior and open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. Tables were a little too close together in some areas to the point where you're dining with the table next to you. Staff and servers were not very friendly and seemed cold towards us (possibly because we were English speaking tourists). The berry mojito was delicious. The calamari was quite good also. Would like to try pizza if I ever go back, but not likely."}
{"text":"Charming and nice place. Excellent pizza made  in restaurant. BEVO's interior is a great style. Très bon service, rapide, délicieux pizza et bon prix."}
{"text":"Service: Just OK, a little slow. It was a Friday night around 6 pm.

Atmosphere: Good. The decor is nice and it feels just a little upscale. Though you don't need to dress up.

Food: Just OK. The noodles are from a box, which is a little disappointing. If you're expecting authentic Italian food, you won't find it here. We had the rosa pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms. The flavor was excellent, but I found it a little salty. We also had the margarita pizza, which was just OK. The crust was nice and thin but the flavor was a little dull.

Price point: I found this place a little expensive for what you get. Wine was very expensive, and you get probably 1/4 of a glass (for 9-14$ per glass, or around $40 and over for a bottle).

Overall it was just OK."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The decor is chic, good service, and delicious food. I had my first burrata here and oh my, I can't get enough of it. I especially like the penne with mushroom dish, as well as the classic margherita pizza. 

Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One thing I've learned in my many years is that if a restaurant is located in the heart of a tourist trap, it doesn't have to be very good to be packed with people.  That being said, this place wasn't very good... But it was packed.

The pizza was decent but of course EXPENSIVE.  My sons lasagna looked like it was Russell Stoffers microwave lasagna.  

The waiter was this rude, bald guy who barely spoke to us... I think he hated tourists that ate in a tourist trap.  Very odd.  He could've gotten us to drink 3 more beers each but he never asked us how we were doing... So we left.   I hate how you almost HAVE to leave a tip when waiters suck this bad.

I'd skip this place and eat at Restaurant Taberna all week because it's awesome."}
{"text":"Great pizza and calamari and nice cold Kronnenburg 1664. Atmosphere is really cool and service is good. Waitresses were very friendly and helpful. If you're in Old Town Montreal, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Great Italian food... we came back twice it was so good. Pizza was excellent and I also had their lasagna which was also delicious. Inside is nicely decorated with plenty of tvs around. Outside dining is also great and lots of stores near by. Nice location."}
{"text":"Cute place, really good pizza with fresh ingredients. Mushroom and prosciutto pizza was delicious. Good selection of beer on tap. Only waiter seemed a bit disoriented - I asked for a glass of beer but ended up with a pint."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Old Montreal. This place is packed during the weekend, so don't forget to make reservations in advance. The ambiance here is trendy. A fancy cast iron chandelier hangin, 80's music playing in the background, what's not to like about this place.  We ordered the Arancino, Antipasti, Meatballs and pizza's. The Arancino's are delish. Deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce.   Antipasti was ok. Meatballs were delicious too. Now for the pizza's........Not one of  the best pizza's I've had, but they were good. We tried the Bosco in Bianco, Capriciosa & Cotto E Bocconcini.  The crust is flavorful. Woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, Though I prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt.  The Capriciosa was interesting as I'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. It actually tastes really good. Also ask for the spicy oil. That adds a lot of flavor to it.
Definitely worth a visit ...... Again & again...... At least for the Arancino's  


Food -  Good
Service - Friendly
Ambiance - Trendy
Worth the money - Aw yissss"}
{"text":"Visited with our 3 kids and the food was awesome!  Not necessarily a family restaurant but they still loved it.  Very cool brick walls!"}
{"text":"This was the only place open at 11pm on a Friday night . The pizza was nothing to brag about and the cost was high . Two pizzas with toppings cost $56.00"}
{"text":"Mid way through our pizza craving phase, we tried out BEVO (my reason was cause I love the location). 
It ruined our pizza phase and now we are over it. The pizzas were burnt, minimally topped with cheese and that was probably the only time I hated bacon. They ruined it completely, there were tiny flies buzzing around outside and inside the restaurant. Service was slow and it's way too expensive for a tasteless experience. 
I would never go back and would discourage everyone from trying it out as well"}
{"text":"Very good place.  I had the lasagna and my wife had gnocchi.  Both were very tasty.  The service was also very good.  I would try to sit outside if possible and people watch."}
{"text":"This place is a great combination of ambiance, location, crowd, and food. I went with a group and we ordered several different pizzas to try more than one. I liked all of them. The cheeses and sauces were great and the flavours of the topings were equally good. The service was also great. Love that this place is in the Old Port but make sure you have a parking plan. Access to this area by car is terrible."}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza, service and prices - you can't really go wrong with this gem of a place! The Margherita pizza is perfection!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night for dinner and I was impressed.  They had both indoor and outdoor door seating both having a great atmosphere. The outdoor was on a side street patio and was more roomy than typical urban outdoor venues.  Inside had nice decor. 
The food was delicious.  We got a prosciutto Margarita pizza with mixed berry mojitos.
The mojito was interesting tasting with a fizzy soda taste,  but the fresh fruits added great flavor. 
The pizza was great,  flavorful,  crispy but soft on the side... It's that perfect equilibrium for brick oven... And this is coming from a kid that eats NJ pizza everyday... I was a bit scared because of the difference in water,  but bevo gets it right.. 

The service,  the atmosphere and the food make this place a must go to."}
{"text":"Limited Italian menu but great food and excellent service. My wife and I both enjoyed the insalata verde and the salame pizza which was enough for us to share.  This place was recommended by the very friendly help at the tourist information office and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The location, decor, and service were great. Everyone was friendly and eager to please the patrons. I enjoyed my pizza but thought it was a tad too salty and my friend found the pizza to be a bit too spicy. All in all, I liked it and would go back."}
{"text":"Made reservations to make sure we'd get a seat. Silly us, made them for 4pm, showed up prompt and the doors were locked and there was some construction going on right outside so it was confusing to people wondering if they were open and/or you could get in the front door. Anyway, we killed some time in the nearby shops and came back. Place was empty...actually stayed empty the whole time we were there. The food we ordered was very good and drinks solid as well. Waiter was attentive, how could he not be with the only customers in the house? Food came out quickly as well, for the same reasons. Not quite a 4* experience but also not 3* either, wish Yelp permitted a 1/2 star system to give it. Solid 3.5*"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers! Was in Montreal for the weekend and Yelp helped me find a great place to eat. I got kudos from my friends for finding such a great spot. We were staying just outside Chinatown so this place was very central. As soon as we walked in, the music was great, and it was such a friendly atmosphere. I ordered the chicken  and my friends had pizzas which they enjoyed. One of our friends ordered a stuffed pasta. I can't remember the name of it but the portion size was extremely small and she didn't seem to enjoy it much.  The best part was we told the waiter we were celebrating my friend's bachelorette and he wouldn't let us leave without having a tequila shot, on him! And he even joined us. He said it was to celebrate and apologize for the wait but we honestly weren't even waiting that long!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 brick oven pizzas, Arugula salad and a cheese plate. Perfect amount of food for 2 adults and 2 teen daughters. All was tasty. Service a little slow But that was ok since we are in no hurry on vacation."}
{"text":"An amazing meal, causal atmosphere and attentive service. By far our best meal in Montreal and we did the Old Montreal food tour earlier today."}
{"text":"Bevo is an Italian restaurant in the old port of Montreal serving an variety of Italian dishes like pasta and some creative dishes like veal poutine. But most like I, would come here for the wood oven pizza! We shared three different pizzas amongst the group and all agreed, that the crust was perfectly thin and chewy, and the toppings were perfection! We all raved about the Parma in Bianco; this pizza was topped with prosciutto, roquette and parmesan cheese and although it was simple, was flavourful and savoury, perfectly balanced with the sauce. 

The venue itself is nice and informal, with stone walls and an industrial decor, and highly popular with the tourists. It can get a little loud due to DJs playing music later at night, but the friendly service and good cocktails would soon make you forget the noise."}
{"text":"BEVO was the best pizza I have ever had. I have high standards since I am from Chicago and I was impressed. I did not think I would enjoy the Margherita because it was not overloaded with cheese, but it was perfect. The only con I have is the pizzas are only about 10\"."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great patio! I went on a busy summer night but the only wait was for the patio. It was worth the wait... service was attentive and friendly, the pizza tasted great and the atmosphere was perfect!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place one afternoon wandering through Old Montreal. The pizza selection isn't huge but they are cooked perfectly! The crust is fresh and exactly what a fresh pizza dough should taste like. They have a great outdoor seating area perfect for people watching. The beer and wine list is good. This is a great spot to sit and grab some good pizza and drinks. My only knock against it is at night on the weekends the music is blasting and it almost has a club vibe to it, if that's not your scene find another place to hang out. Can't wait to go back for the pizza though!!"}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for a weekend with close friends. As we lingered around Old Montreal debating on which restaurant to go to since there were so many to choose from, we just stopped at Bevo since it had spacious outdoor seating. I am glad we stopped and chose this spot!

The food here is amazing and I absolutely miss it! The mushroom pizza with black truffle and their white clam pasta was so delicious! Can't find anything comparable to Bevo here in Boston. If you still have room for dessert, I definitely suggest you try the gelato. It was a twist of pistachio, vanilla and chocolate. I'm not a fan of sweets, but this was a great treat to top off the meal! Their Bellini's are yummy as well!

Service was great. Our waitress was attentive and really sweet.

I'm definitely coming back whenever I get to come back to Montreal and visit!"}
{"text":"Le BEVO Bar Pizzeria, un grand restau italien sur 2 étages situé en plein coeur du Vieux-Montreal, quartier toujours bien vivant quand le beau temps montre le bout de son nez. Le BEVO dispose également d'une grande terrasse, et quand on est arrivé c'était déjà bondé, on a attendu environs une bonne vingtaine de minutes pour avoir une table. En attendant nous avons pris un verre à l'intérieur, j'ai pris un Amareto Sour: très bon. Le décor est très sympa, ambiance assez lounge, d'ailleurs, ils ont 3 immenses boules accrochées au plafond dans lesquelles on peut s'asseoir, et n'ayant pas de place au bar, on s'y est donc installé. C'était très confortable, on se balançait un peu, on aurait bien mangé notre pizza là tiens! 

Ensuite une table se libère et il est temps pour nous de prendre place pour commander. On a pris la COTTO E BOCCONCINI et la BOSCO IN BIANCO (accompagnée de truffes noires). À peine 10 minutes plus tard, nous voilà servi. On commence avec la BOSCO, on a évidemment hâte de goûter les fameuses truffes! Et là le HIC! On commence à manger et on ne goûte absolument rien, alors on commence à les chercher sur la pizza, à goûter les différents champignons s'y trouvant et aucune truffe, alors que c'est un aliment qui a une saveur particulière et relativement forte.
On appelle donc la serveuse pour lui demander mais où sont les truffes!? Et elle-même dit ne pas les voir! Elle a donc directement ramener la pizza en cuisine et nous en a amené une nouvelle et là, mais quelle différence, rien qu'à l'odeur, à la vue  et la première bouché, les truffes y étaient cette fois! Alors, oublie de la part du cuistot en plein coup de feu ou attrape-nigaud?! Telle est la question! Car les gens qui ne s'y connaissent pas un minimum, pourraient très bien se faire avoir, alors faites tout de même attention.

Si cela n'avait pas eu lieu, c'était un 5 étoiles immédiat, car les 2 pizzas étaient délicieuses, avec leurs pâtes fines, on s'est régalé!"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous! The service was wonderful! It was really nice to sit outside, enjoy a delicious meal, and some reasonably priced cocktails on this summer night!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. It really made my getaway special. Recommend any pizza! Of course the chocolate cake to end the meal was a must and did not disappoint. Great portion sizes and the prices were extremely reasonable! Would recommend this place to anyone heading to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night for dinner. The pizza was wonderful and we had very good service even for a large party. I tasted various dishes my friends ordered and they were all very good."}
{"text":"I love the pizzas here it is well made specially the Nutella pizza that I can't express it ! It's a heaven on earth ! Imagine the Nutella on a wood fired Bread oh can't tell u how good it is ! I also like the drinks they are tasty  !! But the pasta there I don't recommend it and also the manager of this place !!read the story  and you guys judge by your self  !! I got an allergy due to a spices in the hot sauce and I asked  him very nicely if they have any medication like antihistamine  !! his response was we are not a pharmacist !!! I was shocked and I wanted to just tell him that I know the difference between pharmacy and a restaurant !!! Even if he doesn't have it he could just say no sorry we don't !! Anyway if you like a good pizza give it a try you for sure will love it !"}
{"text":"This was probably my absolute favorite pizza that I have ever had. Great for a nice fancy dinner or just a casual pizza place. The service was good and our waitress was nice and helpful. They had a great selection and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times due to its location. Prices are reasonable and the vibe is great. People tend to get dressed up pretty nice to come out here.
However, I find the food very ordinary. I don't like when a restaurants good is just \"okay\" when it has such an excellent location and vibe. The pizzas are probably your best option since they are oven baked. The food is not terrible, but it's nothing to brag about. When I come here it's mostly for its location and the music (on the weekends they have a live DJ which is a nice touch)."}
{"text":"First time but memorable and definite repeat. 
I love the place with it's atmosphere, staff, DJ at the bar and FOOD. 
Had penne pasta dish, and wow. Pasta done perfect, crispy prosciutto, make sure you clean the morsels of small bits and sauce with a piece of crusty bread. 
Had a tiramisu for dessert, I never had \"nonna's\" made one, but this could be it. Just felt like hearty homestyle dessert. 
I also found one of my fav Chardonnay's, a treat on top of it all. 
Price is very decent for a business traveller, being one myself. 
Will come back."}
{"text":"Giancarlo at Bevo was the BEST waiter during our stay in Montreal.  The food was fantastic!  Very flavorful and the service was primo!  Thank you Bevo and Giancarlo."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Bevo for dinner tonight. We shared the large antipasto platter and burrata. Standouts were the stuffed ricotta pasta and lasagna. Margarita pizza and pomodoro pasta were delicious. Only disappointment was the pizza dough had egg, which doesn't happen very often, so my daughter had to have the vegan pasta. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"This place is really good! We can here twice while in Montreal. I really like their pizzas and the tortellini with ricotta and spinach. The pesto sauce was so creamy and delicious. The oil they give you to put on your pizza is also really good and spicy! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"On  Monday January 2, I arrived at 9:02pm for a 915pm reservation for 3 people. The waitress requested that we wait while the table was prepared in the dining area. After a few minutes the table was ready. However, she asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We politely declined. She then indicated the table would be ready at 915pm and to leave and return at that time. Meanwhile, it was about 9:07pm. We left and walked around Old Montreal for a few moments and returned at 915pm. When we arrived, she politely escorted us to the same table that was prepared earlier. Very awkward. Not to mention the pizza appetizer was amazing, but the main courses Lasagna, Gnocchi and Pescadora were cold when they were brought out. Overall, between the hostess and the selection of food I would not recommend this place. However, our waiter was fantastic. I hope Bevo-Pizzeria uses this feedback constructively to improve the overall restaurant experience. Great Potential."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!

Fresh made dough on site and fantastic toppings.  Went later after the sun went down and it cooled of nicely.

Enjoyed this place in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance, horrible slow service  

Had a great selection of creative cocktails and live dj"}
{"text":"Pretty convenient for late night munchies. Husband and I went there for a late evening pizza experience. Our server was nice, and our pizza was quick to arrive. We ordered truffle and mushroom white pizza. For some reason, I couldn't really smell the truffles although the pizza tasted good. The crust was nice and crisp. 3.5 rounds to four for friendly welcoming hostess."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had or tasted in my life it was amazing! I wanted to go eat there everyday! I had the salami pizza which is the same as pepperoni it was spicier than normal but I love spice so it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place this amazing!!! Not only is the food delicious but the service is also outstanding.  We had dinner at BEVO during a bachelorette weekend trip to Montreal.  We made reservations ahead of time but when the day arrived, our plans changed and the time we had our reservations was not going to work out.  Because the reservation was for a big party, we figured that it was going to be hard to get it moved up to an earlier time given that the place is crazy busy and booked every night. We called the restaurant and spoke to Cynthia.  Although it took a little convincing and some begging, we got our reservation time moved up so that we could make it fit into our plans.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by our server Angelica.  She was absolutely amazing.  She really went above and beyond to get to know us and what were celebrating.  She even gave the bachelorette a small treat to make her feel special.   It was so wonderful to get the kind of service that we do not see in the states to often.  Thank you BEVO, Cynthia and Angelica for a wonderful dinner experience."}
{"text":"Looked at the Yelp rating and was excited to try this restaurant with my kids.  However, when we arrived the host asked if we had a reservation.  We politely said,\"no\".  

She said, \"we have no table\" and didn't even offer if we want to wait for one.  They just turn us away.

I checked open table later and almost all time slots were available tonight.  I sincerely believe we were discriminated against and warn others to think twice before coming here."}
{"text":"Good food but overly priced for small portions of food they serve. Our server was really nice and made some good suggestions for pasta and wine."}
{"text":"Pros: good selection, good food, fun atmosphere, good service, tasty drinks, good location. 

Cons: parking was tough to find on a busy night, pricey."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the F1 and decided to stop by Bevo for pizza. The place was packed and people looked good. 

The waitress got us a table outside and that was great, but the service was awful. We ordered an appetizer that didn't come until the two entrees did (olives, nothing fancy). Our sodas were flat and warm and she didn't bring us the ice we asked for. The waitress kept forgetting to bring what we asked her for and was not friendly at all. 

All and all the place was good but I think they might have been overwhelmed by the public or the waitress was new."}
{"text":"What a find!  Great pizza and wine with superlative service despite how busy this place was on a Wednsday(10/21)!  Our waitress Lillian moved smoothly yet quickly through the night.  We ordered two appetizers olives and fennel salad which came out before our delicious thin crust pizza.  My husband had a cocktail and then ended up ordering the same glass of red wine (St. Christina) that I had.   We didn't know where to eat we were in Old Montreal walking and I looked right down rue st Vincent and noticed a marquee in front of the door.  Walked to it and noticed how full it was with locals and went in to see if we could get seated.  The hostess said yes as long as we could be done by 9pm since we didn't have a reservation. It was 715pm we had no problem- appetizer, dinner, dessert done by 830!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really really good. A little pricy but definitely worth it.
Very happy with the service, everyone was quite polite. Went here on a Friday night and it wasn't too packed but still full enough."}
{"text":"I had seen many advertisements for Bevo Bar + Pizzeria around Montreal and have also heard many great things from friends. When it came up as an option on OpenTable, I made reservations right away. Located in the Old Port of Montreal, it offers a very cozy and friendly atmosphere. 

To begin, we ordered my boyfriend's go-to-drink Rye & Ginger and I ordered the \"Godfather\" which is scotch and amaretto. Our drinks lasted for the entire meal- they hit the spot.

We then ordered the PIATTO BEVO charcuterie platter with marinated vegetables, served with fior di latte mozzarella. We ordered the small platter and it was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend could not stop raving about it & honestly, we didn't know how we would have room for our main courses. The small platter is definitely enough for two people.

For the main course, my boyfriend had the FILETTO DI DENTICE-red snapper filet, salsa cruda, fine herbs. He thoroughly enjoyed it and said it was very light. 

I ordered the PORCHETTA AL FORNO-roasted pork loin with fine herb white wine. As soon as it was put in front of me, I started salivating. The smell alone was amazing. I was unable to eat the whole thing since I was so full from our appetizer but I cannot wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. It was absolutely delicious.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Stone buildings, beautiful chandeliers, a wonderful bar and you can see your pizzas being made in front of you in their wood fire stove. The service was amazing, our waiter was incredibly friendly and approachable. It was fast and there was not one bad thing to be said about it. While plate costs around $30 each, the portions they serve you makes it worth it. Overall, it was an amazing experience. While we were there a man even proposed to his bride-to-be outside of the restaurant so it was extra special.I would encourage any Montrealer to go- I know we will be going back! We can't wait to try more meals!

For more reviews, check out my Yelp page and also check out the blog that is listed!"}
{"text":"Wood-fired pizzas. That's all you need to know, one of the best pizzas I've had, the crust was amazing and even the little things like the chilli oil was so gooood! Waitress was really nice and let my boyfriend practice his French haha the ambiance is good for a casual get together or a bit more fancy. And they have cool swinging chairs! There's also a patio but it was raining when we went."}
{"text":"the nay's...it's definitely a tourist trap and does get overly loud. It's also slightly over priced. i think the way to go is to split a bunch of dishes like our group did, makes it much more affordable and you get to try a bunch of things! was a little disappointed with our pitcher of sangria..just wasn't that tasty and seemed too watered down. my friend's berry mojito also tasted a bit off. 

the pro's...our waitress was so, so sweet and accommodating to our group's dietary restrictions (some vegetarians) and made it extra special for the bachelorette we were celebrating. (Ask for a special shot ;)) The restaurant is also a beautiful venue and HUMONGOUS. Loved the decor. My friend and I split a standard pepperoni pizza which was delicious and i surprisingly even enjoyed the couple of bites of my friend's carrot soup which i was not expecting to like. (creamy and the carrot wasn't overwhelming.) Tried some truffled mushroom pizza which was amazingggg. The tortellini with riccotta/spinach was also tasty. 

So 5 stars for food, service and ambiance but probably a 3 for the drinks and prices. Easily fixable in my opinion! I'd recommend this spot to anyone coming from out of town...in a central area right in the middle of old port. loved walking around after (there was a cute little alley of cool art and jewelry right near by, def worth checking it!)"}
{"text":"Ammaaazzziinnggggg Italian food! Literally just ate here and couldn't wait to leave a review! The salami pizza and homemade tortellini was phenomenal! If you happen to be in old port def. eat here!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant italien se situe dans le vieux montréal, un peu à l'écart des rues touristiques et trop passantes. On m'avait suggéré cet endroit pour les cocktails diversifiés ainsi que pour l'ambiance du samedi soir, un DJ est sur place. Nous sommes arrivées vers 20:30, l'endroit était déjà bien rempli de nombreux groupes, nous avons eu une table au 2e étage à l'écart du bruit. L'endroit en soit est charmant avec ses murs en brique mais enlaidi par une décoration trop colorée et bien trop kitsch, le tout se mélange très mal. Nous avons pris en entrée les calamars frits puis une pizza à partager. Les calamars viennent avec une sauce bien relevée qui pique la bouche et la pizza très bien faite, avec une croûte mince. La serveuse a même été assez accommodante pour modifier la garniture de notre pizza. Comme la majorité des commentaires que j'ai lu, les prix sont un peu trop élevés, mais bon on s'attend à quoi dans le Vieux? Le gérant nous a par la suite, installées au bar afin de terminer la soirée, avec un pichet de sangria trop rafraichissant et bien dosé en alcool. Nous étions à côté du DJ et on pouvait danser près de nos sièges. Ce fut vraiment une belle soirée. J'y retournerais pour l'ambiance, mais pour ce qui est de la nourriture on a vu mieux ailleurs :)"}
{"text":"Went there last night and had a good time all in all. We killed half an hour or so at the bar while sipping on a Godfather and a Vespa Martini for my friend. There are great views of the place from the bar, cute waitresses and clientele, many more ladies than guys. 
We eventually were brought upstairs, at the end of the gallery with direct views of the pizza oven which was quite cool. The walls are stone and irregular which add to the ambiance. 
Well what started out like a quite nice experience turned a bit annoying, after the waitstaff realized they forgot our pizza order yet told us they were simply \"busy\". Probably not the truth.. it was already after 10:30pm and the restaurant had emptied out quite a bit by that time. 
Either way, not the end of the world but not cool either. The pizza was quite good though but it would have been nice to see some sort of gesture to compensate for our one hour + wait. 
Maybe it was just a fluke? 

Est-ce que tout est correct? Ouais.. presque!"}
{"text":"I really really didn't want to like this place (kind of tongue in cheek)- I love me my Mangiafoco, and want to be able to say that nothing holds a candle to it..... but alas...  I liked it.  I really really liked it.  Ok- the noise level is through the roof, which makes dining and actually having a conversation very hard.... but the dining part is easy.  Burrata, salumi plate, polpette - 3 delicious appetizers.  When I asked for some balsamic for the burrata, I didn't get attitude... I got... balsamic!  Mains - pasta pomodoro, the lasagna and a simple pizza were all equally delicious.  Take my word for it... it is easy to make a pomodoro sauce... it is really hard to make a great pomodoro sauce.  This one was delicious.

Damn you Bevo... I didn't want to like you.  :)"}
{"text":"Really liked the food here.  The salami pizza was excellent, along with the basil pomodoro pasta.  Also enjoyed the green salad."}
{"text":"Under the impression that they have big servings (from what I was told) yet disappointed when my order came.

This tortellini tasted good. But really? This pasta entree for $19 + tax?? and you get 4 pcs of it? I wish we were told by the waitress that the serving is going to be like this when we told her me and my friend were sharing."}
{"text":"I had been hearing so many good things about Bevo and I have to say i'm happy I was finally able to give it a try for myself ! They mainly serve Italian dishes like Arancino, Risotto , pasta and pizza etc. They have a nice selection of classical and more out of the box options to choose from. 

Pricing wise, it is very reasonable, especially with consideration to the fact that the portion sizes are great and the quality of the food and service is there. Our server was friendly and attentive to ensure that we had everything we needed. 

The decor inside is casual but still very pretty  with high ceilings, exposed brick and chandeliers. Great for a date , for groups or for families.The only thing was that for such a big space they do try to have as much seating as possible, so while it doesnt feel crowded in when you're sitting down at your table, it can be tough to circulate through some section. we did get our chairs bumped into more than a few times by some of the other guests. (Keeping in mind that this is a small detail and did not ruin the overall experience)

I had a peach bellini that was absolutely delicious , not too sweet and so refreshing ! Their veal poutine is a great choice , tender braised veal and their own spin on the gravy , so well spiced with lots of stretchy tasty cheese and perfectly cooked fries. The flavour was great but not overpowering so you can enjoy every bite to the end without being overhwhelmed.  And of course , a pizza addict like me couldn't come to Bevo and NOT try one of their pizzas! I had the Formaggio Di Capra E Spinaci (goat cheese, spinach, tomato sauce& sun dried tomato). The dough was nice and thin ,cooked in a wood oven, it had great texture flavour, and a great balance of all the delicious toppings! 

All in all this was a great experience in all aspects , definitely coming back here again !"}
{"text":"Go here!! We are visiting from Jersey and fell in love with Bevo. The cocktails were excellent..go for the blood orange Cosmo and berry mojito. The pizza with prosciutto, arugula and reggiano was to die for!  (Trust us we know pizza) We also shared the meatball sandwich...delish.  The atmosphere was super friendly..staff great (esp Nick at the bar...great service and inside travel tips!) would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Five Stars based on value
Great pizza, pasta, service, beer and wine list, and unlike most places in downtown Montreal and Old Port, they don't gouge the captive customer. Really nice interior too. Went twice during a week long trip."}
{"text":"Back in July, I was Montreal for a pre-conference, before the National conference in March. A group (8?) of us wandered in for dinner and our expectations were beyond met! The server was phenomenal, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was wonderful. Bevo has a very \"trendy\" vibe, so we were afraid it would be pretentious, but were happily mistaken! 

In fact, we had such a great time, my local chapter decided to host our national social there. I will say we had a few issues: I felt the space we were given was small, and it was right at the bar, so it was high-traffic with the servers for the whole restaurant coming through; it was also right at the door, so I felt I was always on top of the maitre'd. Food was amazing as expected, but drink service was on the slow side, even with 2 dedicated servers. Food service was good--we had a variety of items, and they were very good about putting out a few trays and replacing them with new items through the evening rather than bringing everything out all at once.

It's also popular; both times I've been here (evening), there have been plenty of patrons, but I only felt crushed during the social. i don't recommend Bevo for a night drinking beer in a t-shirt and jeans watching hockey, but I do recommend it for dinner and drinks with friends, before or as your night out."}
{"text":"I went there last night for dinner with 9 of my friends. 8 of us ordered pizza but my boyfriend who's lactose intolerant had to order the spaghetti bolognese which honestly was absolute shit. First of all it was overcooked penne, not spaghetti and the sauce tasted like a can of cheap Ragu sauce from the  grocery store. 

The rest of us enjoyed our pizza while my boyfriend ate  his mush of a pasta. On top of that the price of said spaghetti bolognese was $18!

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Outrageous! I'm not sure if it's because we are American or an interracial group, but the host (bald male with glasses) refused to seat us. After looking us up and down & he said the wait would be 30 minutes or more \"because everyone came in at once for dinner\". When we pointed out the empty tables throughout the restaurant he claimed that the tables were not set & that we couldn't sit there. He gave us excuse after excuse for why we couldn't eat there. I have never experienced such rudeness, discomfort and discrimination in all of my travels. This guy almost ruined our night. Luckily we took our appetites and money to the restaurant around the corner where we had a fabulous meal & waitress."}
{"text":"We were walking around the Old City in Montréal and wanted to grab a bite. We settled on BEVO, because they had a vegan option for my wife. I'll be honest with you, I have a love and hate relationship with this place. First, prices are typical for a touristy area like the Old City. Food was tasty, but somewhat overpriced. I had Tortellini con ricotta e spinaci (tortellini with spinach and ricotta), which cost $19. Now, if they served 7-8 of them, I would not have a reason to complain. However, they served 4 tortellini. **FOUR** for $19. That's $5 for each tortellini. This is ridiculous! Sure, they were INCREDIBLY tasty, I admit. The chef did a wonderful job....but $5 per tortellini is a rip off IMO.

Service was alright. Nothing to write home about. The patio was ok too. Not too noisy and steps away from the main street with souvenir stores.

Perhaps this place is great for drinks at night, since they have a pretty cool decor and bar inside, but in terms of food, I'd rather go to a different place next time, which has a better ratio of value for money."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Montreal with some buddies for dinner. Like many restaurants in Montreal, this one turned into a club over the course of the night with a DJ playing some pretty good tunes and people feeling good while eating what turned out to be some really good food. We got there around 8pm and there were people dancing on the bar and shots going around... So that pretty much tells the story. Oh and definitely make a reservation before coming.

The margarita pizza was actually delicious. Not the best ever, but definitely delicious and a perfect meal to go with the upbeat and trendy atmosphere that this place presents. We ended up staying here a lot longer than originally planned both for drinks as well as for more pizza. The calamari was also really good as well.

Great spot for a pre-game or even to make a night of it. Either way you sure won't be disappointed by the food or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Pizza was very decent, my grilfriend really enjoyed her Red Snapper.
Was impressed at the amount of dinners that they could turn out. So all in all very decent dinner, with a great location, not your run of the mill tourist restaurant in the Old Port."}
{"text":"Five stars solely because when we were hungry and looking for food at midnight (we missed dinner because we were glued to our hotel TV watching the Leafs playoff game) this was the only place that claimed to be open late and actually turned out to be telling the truth. And when you're hungry at midnight, that counts for a lot.

(Pizza was good also and the house DJ enthusiastically mixing behind the bar was quite entertaining.)"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant de pizza préféré, point. En plus, elle est très abordable (environ 13$) et peut être partagé à deux (encore moins cher)! Un autre plus, ils vendent de ma Pale Ale de la brasserie McAuslan."}
{"text":"Disappointed - not even the comfortable high chairs could convince me otherwise.
My co-worker ordered a drink but it turned out that they were out, then she ordered another kind of drink and they were also out, until she had to settle for the same order as my other co-worker's drink, which took a while to get.
There was a problem in the kitchen so our orders took long. I had read good reviews about this place so I was pretty excited. When we finally got our food, I was disappointed to see that there was barely any sauce with my pasta dish, the Rosata penne with prosciutto and mushrooms. It's as if they scraped off the bottom of the pan to get all the remaining sauce. I don't think this was worth 19$."}
{"text":"this place has probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had. I got the regular pepperoni... Which is a classic, but it was amazing. The bread was so fresh. It also comes with a spicy oil sauce for dipping which is so so good!!!! if I am ever in Montreal again I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"BEVO is a super cute restaurant located in beautiful Old Montreal! Unfortunately the location is probably the best thing about this restaurant.

Although the restaurant was fairly packed, the hostess found a great place for us to sit. The first problem was the waitress. Firstly, she forgot my friend's drink. Secondly, when I placed my order and explained some changes that needed to be made (to accommodate allergies), she almost seemed annoyed. Luckily, the food came out very quickly. I enjoyed my meal quite a bit, although it was very overpriced. My friend complained that her pizza was cold. The menu was pretty average. The selection is decent, but not the greatest for those who can't/ don't eat things such as dairy, gluten, etc. (there was only one option that was both vegan and gluten-free). 

Overall, the location is great, the food was good (for the most part), but unfortunately, the service was much below average."}
{"text":"Great for drinks and pizza. The waitress was very attentive and checked in with us frequently. I ordered the salame pizza and it was good but a little spicy. Overall decent food and great service."}
{"text":"The swordfish was exquisite and so was the pasta with rose sauce. The pizza's were also delicious and the calamari was fried to perfection. All in all a great meal, waiting for the desserts!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pizza place with a young, hip atmosphere, this is it. If you're looking for the best pizza in Montreal, look elsewhere.

The crust was very well done with the perfect thickness and chewiness, but the flavours of both the mushroom and margherita pizzas fell short. The mushrooms overpowered the pizza and were rubbery and a bit bland. The only thing that saved that pizza was the truffle flavour. The antipasto platter we ordered as a starter was also disappointing. 

On the plus side, our service was great."}
{"text":"First stop in Montreal after reading some yelp reviews. The pizza really is as good as people say it is, and the staff is super friendly. We sat at the bar and had a couple drinks while we ate - they even turned on American college football for me. The interior is cool and they have outdoor seating, definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner if you're in the area."}
{"text":"These guys make delicious tasting food and have amazing customer service.  We were staying at a nearby hotel and had a crying bab6 and injured mommy in our party.   Needless to say they were amazingly accommodating and dropped puff a take out order for us and everything was delicious.  Thanks Bevo team..we always loved ypur menu now we appreciate ypur service team as well!"}
{"text":"Cocktails: The Vespa Martini or Berry Mojito.
Antipasti: fennel + pecans.
Main: It's frequently difficult to choose between the goat cheese + spinach pizza and the mushroom risotto. I should just not choose... and bring one home with me."}
{"text":"We opted to stop by for a sangria and glass of wine and I think we wished we ate here.  They have a beautiful street side patio (on a side street, so less traffic) and good service.

The inside is pretty hip looking - dark walls/floors and red decor.  I can't rate the food, but we enjoyed our happy hour cocktail enough to consider giving this place a try next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas les premiers avis qui ont été rédigés. Puisque le Bevo n'est ouvert que depuis quelques semaines, j'ai décidée de ne pas laisser la note globale m'influencer et de l'essayer quand même. J'en suis bien contente. J'y suis allée en fin de semaine pour un souper de famille pour ma fête. On était 12 et le resto a pris notre réservation à peine quelques heures avant. Le décor de Bevo est vraiment cool! Des chaises transparentes qui pendent de l'escalier, un bar avec une lueur rouge intrigante, des murs de pierres et de brique non recouverts et des tables de bois font de cet endroit un de ceux avec les designs les plus cools de Montréal. Côté cocktails, ceux auxquels j'ai goûté sont très bons sauf que la Sangria Campari goûte beaucoup plus comme un Mimosa... Les pâtes sont cuites \"al dente\" et elles sont parfaites. Les sauces sont toutes très bonnes mais la rosée est vraiment la meilleure. On a pris qu'une seule pizza, celle à la roquette, et il manquait un peu de goût mais en même temps, c'était un bon contraste aux pâtes. Et le service et vraiment super bien. Nos serveurs, John et John, nous ont fait rire, ont tout emmené dans un bon délai sans jamais se tromper à savoir  quelle assiette allait à qui. Ça été une belle soirée et ça m'a donné le goût d'y retourner pour passer du temps au bar du premier étage pour un bon cocktail après une longue semaine de travail. Bravo Bevo!"}
{"text":"Tasty explosion of flavors in a very trendy, rustic atmosphere with what looked like some elements of modern art. The staff are friendly and made our time there very comfortable. Plus our server, I believe his name is Andrew, was amazing, prompt, just the right speed in receiving our food. Oh! There's more  bit.ly/ChoNillaBEVO"}
{"text":"A very large trendy pizza place in Old Montreal.  A bit crowded but decent pies (not great).  Looks like a fun place for drinks and nightlife but we were there for dinner only. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"In town for a few days and a colleague suggested Bevo as i said I wanted good Italian...didn't disappoint. 

I was able to make a nice little evening first going to the Basilica and then walking to Bevo. The service was friendly and prompt.

There were so many good looking appetizers but I decided to just get an entree. I settled on the mushroom risotto - yum! I am a bit of a risotto snob and this one was delightful. 

I was also advised to order the Nutella pizza however I was just too full. But it looked wonderful. 

The only real downside was that they don't have wifi and when dining alone it would be nice to have!"}
{"text":"I like a good pizza. Scratch that - I love a good pizza. It has gotten to the point where I am experimenting at home making my own... and getting decent success as I keep working out the kinks. It's not perfect but in the meantime, that is what good restaurants are for, am I right? Last month, following a wonderful few hours at La Mondiale de la Biere enjoying many many brews, my friends and I got the hankering for some pizza. Thinking about the options closest to us, I figured a visit to BEVO in the old port was in order. So we casually walked over ready to enjoy some good Italian cuisine.

Located just off Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of the Old Port, BEVO visually is in keeping with many of the Old Port establishments - a mix of the old brick and stone foundations of the area buildings with some more modern elements to add some glam. In this case, BEVO uses red tinted glass around the atrium, a very large chandelier and an tile entry wait which includes a glass wine cellar. The first floor has a huge bar area where the backbar is lit up in red and the front of the actual bar is just a light box. Add an area where there are 70s-style hanging bubble chairs and you have a spot that is clearly a solid happy hour zone.

On this occasion however, we were there too late for happy hour and too early for any late-night bar scene. The two dining areas are more straight forward than the bar - wooden tables and chairs, paper tablecloths with cute info-graphics about pizza making and red checkered napkins for that little old school Italian restaurant touch. On the first floor, the wood-fired pizza oven is visible for all to see and gets you excited for what is to come.

Our first starter was salsiccia e Rapini - a house made sausage with garlic rapini. The sausages were delicious although a little small for my liking. Rapini is one of those vegetables you either love or hate - personally I am a fan of its bitterness. The combination of bitter with the garlic made a nice partner to the fatty sausages.

The second starter was arancino - saffron parmesan risotto balls with meat ragu and mozzarella. The risotto ball itself had a good crust to it and that didn't come at the cost of drying out the risotto itself. It still had nice creaminess although I really didn't get any hint of saffron personally. The meat ragu draped over it had a nice meaty richness to it and paired very well to the ball itself. Like the previous starter, I just wanted more!

Because one of the friends with me doesn't eat cheese (i know, i know.... i've tried to show him the error of his ways) we did order one non-pizza main dish: the cavatelli bolognese - dumplings, meat ragu and fresh parsley. Excellent plate of pasta - same delicious meat ragu as before with the perfectly cooked cavatelli. A little bit of parmesan would have been nice but that was a lost battle from the start in this case.

Now we arrive to the main attraction: the pizzas. First up, I got the parma in blanco - prosciutto di parma, arugula and reggiano. This is probably my favourite pizza type when dealing with classic thin crust pizzas. The salty rich prosciutto, the pepper arugula, the sharp reggiano and a little bit of olive oil... a perfect balance of items on top of a pizza. However, all of that is wasted if the actual pizza isn't up to snuff. BEVO doesn't have that problem. The wood-fired oven gives a nice crispness to the bottom but allows for just enough rise to create some chewiness. A wonderful pizza.

The other pizza we ordered was the cotto e bocconcini - prosciutto cotto, portobello, tomato sauce, mozzarella and bocconcini. Same solid crust as my pizza although this one had been cooked a little more as the extra charring around the edge demonstrated. The melted bocconcini brought some more creaminess compared to just the mozzarella and the earthy portobellos added some contrast from the prosciutto. Another excellent pizza.

BEVO is a solid experience from beginning to end. Solid starters, delicious pizzas and good pasta. All the beers from Beerfest prior eliminated our desire to test the cocktail and wine lists which seemed interesting. There was also the temptation of the nutella pizza for dessert but we decided to pass. Just gives me another reason to return. If you are looking for a good pizza in the Old Port or just a place to go enjoy a drink and a quick bit, BEVO is worth your consideration.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but charging us 10 dollars extra a pizza because you think we're too drunk to realize was not. When we asked her why the price was different than the price on the menu, she apologized and changed it, but that's not the point. She changed the price to try to get more money thinking we wouldn't realize, but we did. Unacceptable behavior by the wait staff, I would not recommend this place at night."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but atmosphere and great food make up for it. Came in from Texas and had a chicken and it was great. I would recommend this restaurant for families and/or friends."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza.  Possibly the best I have had in North America.  I was also happy with the very nice selection of wine by the glass.  Not a huge amount but certainly enough to have a choice and enjoy!  

If you are alone and can stand direct heat a seat at the pizza oven bar is a good way to go."}
{"text":"Lors du happening Mtl , table d'hote honnete, deco mur de brique et lumieres tamisées. Jolie place."}
{"text":"We check this place out on recommendation of our Uber driver. He was spot on.

We had a great seat outside, with a beautiful atmosphere including some Street music. Service was quick, and our order came out fairly quickly.

The pizza was super good. I had one that was mozzarella black olives and mozzarella chunks. Finished all of it. 

Overall delicious food!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and drinks. The wait staff is incredibly friendly- a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"They didn't bring water until I got the waitresses attention and had to ask for it. 
They can accommodate a group. We were 9 people. 
The place is loud and it's hard to have a conversation with someone sitting right across from you. 
Has a cool trendy atmosphere. 
The portions are a good size. 
I got the chicken and it was pretty good but not amazing. My friend's sword fish was pretty good. I would probably get that next time. Apparently the pizza is also pretty good."}
{"text":"The food at bevo was generally great. We ordered the red wine sangria which was easy to drink and about 2 portions each for 4 pax. However there was a mysterious winter price which was about $8 more than the normal summer price? At least the server came back to inform us about it before serving it to us. 

The seafood pasta and lasagna were both delicious. Ordered a pizza to share as it had great reviews, but wasn't that impressed with it. Perhaps don't get the one with the hard boiled egg on top, as the toppings don't go well with the pizza!

Service was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Montréal for four days and we've dined here twice. We would dine here every night if we had the choice to do it again, but we wanted to try some other places. They were not up to par to the standards that Bevo set on the first night we came, so for our last meal in Montréal, we decided to go to Bevo again. 

First off, the pizza we had was outstanding. Hailing from New York City, I've had my fair share of Italian food and was not prepared to be blown away by Bevo like I did. My boyfriend and I shared a Margarita pizza with prosciutto cotto. He also had a berry mojito. 

The second time we ordered the same pizza and I had the penne with rose sauce with crispy prosciutto and mushrooms. It was possibly- actually no. It was definitely the best pasta I had in the northern hemisphere. Not only does this place have great food, the service is outstanding. It can sometimes lag due to busyness, but the wait staff is always polite and friendly. I highly recommend anyone who is coming to Montréal to dine here. This is definitely my place of choice when I return to MTL."}
