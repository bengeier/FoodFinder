{"text":"A very pleasant surprise in Laval! The restaurant has a beautiful decor. The waiter was very friendly and efficient. The food was delicious. The clam chowder was very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh boy, buckle your seat-belts and grab the popcorn because this is going to be good (I'm also going to tally up every issue I found with this place)

Firstly, I want to point out that I came here with my Father because he received a $100 gift certificate from a good friend of the owner. Wouldn't have ventured out off the island for this but hey, what the heck basically a free meal.

Anyways, my dad and I drove out parked and were seated outside (was a nice day out so why not!). However, we were seated to an empty table, not that if of a dead not like we're eating right away. We get the menus and order (grilled Octopus app, Scallops app, Rib-Eye bone in 18oz rare and pan seared tuna main) right off the bat that's a $100 plus meal for only two, anywhere else the server assigned to your table would want to be as quick and efficient as possible so they could get the biggest tip possible. 

We order and wait 5 minutes for and the bread basket, notice how I only say bread basket and not anything else*

Secondly, we still hadn't gotten cutlery, napkins, water or bread plate*. If you seat guests and an empty table this should be your first priority before you even bring out something like a bread basket, bread isn't a priority but cutlery and napkins are!

We waited about 20 for the appetizers which is long but at $18 each I doubt the kitchen can pump them out crazy quick so not complaining about that. Our Waitress brings us the appetizers (still no cutlery) before she leaves we asked her if she noticed anything missing on the table. Dumbfounded, she says she doesn't notice anything missing until my dad points out that all we have is a bread basket, no cutlery, napkins or water. She runs off for 3 minutes to get the cutlery and napkins and then another 5 for the water*.

The appetizers themselves? They weren't too bad the octopus was the better of the two, well cooked and served with julienned red onion, micro greens capers and diced tomato. Pretty good but not $18 good. The scallops were pan seared and plated on spinach and a pretty good quality olive oil. However the flavour from the scallops weren't there (they were probably frozen ones).

Then, the mains... We waited 30 minutes for the wrong meals. My dad was given a pasta dish and I was given a filet mignon. We told the server right away that this was not ours, he apologized and went to give it to the right table. We waited another 25 minutes for our mains. Once they did arrive our original waitress put them down quickly and was about to rush away (this is a big no-no for any steakhouse, you wait till the customer cuts through the centre of their steak to check if it is cooked to their liking)*. Luckily it looked rare.

Upon closer inspection the centre was rare, but there was a good border of 0.25cm-0.5cm of well done meat on a steak that should be cooked rare. It looked as if the new guy with no grilling experience did the cooking*. The steak was also pretty tough not too enjoyable and it wasn't seasoned properly, it was covered in steak spice and completed masks whatever flavour the meat had (it was also supposed to be dry ages)*. Whatever good nuty, funky flavour that could've been there from the dry aging process was lost to the spice. All it needed was some salt and pepper, nothing else.

The Tuna was mediocre, the sesame seeds that coated the tuna were all burnt and ruined the taste of the tuna*, it was a shame because it had a nice thin sear on it. Also for a main, the slices were very small, about 1-2cm in thickness and there was only 6 of them*. 

We were so turned off by the whole experience so far that we decided to skip on coffee and dessert for save ourselves from further disappointment and long wait times.

All in all this place is a joke of a steakhouse and the staff need some urgent training to learn how to properly serve customers and cook dishes.

The damage? For one meal for two with no wine it came to $124 after tax. There were a total of 7 major issues during the course of our dinner. Really not impressed and very glad we had the gift certificate because there's no way that meal was worth $124"}
{"text":"We came here for my sister's bachelorette dinner at 6.30 on Saturday. The service was unpleasant and slow. When the food came, there was no steak knives placed for us, I personally dislike it. I ordered medium rare t-bone steak and it turned out dry and burnt. The seasoning is bland even the sautéed mushrooms."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stopped in here after a late night at work.  We picked this place because it was one of the few places in Laval still open after 10 on a middle-of-the-week weeknight.  The place was empty which wasn't a surprise at that hour.  

We ordered a bottle of wine to start and a mixed seafood plate appetizer.  The wine was excellent and the seafood was average.  I ordered the Prime Roast Beef medium rare for dinner and it was outstanding.  I didn't even need to use my knife; it was so tender I was able to cut it with my fork.

The service was very good throughout, but they did take a very long time to bring us our checks.  I'm not sure if it's because we were expected to ask for it, but it was at least 15 minutes past closing by the time they brought it.

This is not the type of place I would typically visit on my own dime, but I would happily return while traveling for work.  I would likely try a few other restaurants in the area before returning though."}
{"text":"I'll just start off by saying that my experience at Sterlings wasn't terrible. Our server was very efficient and friendly, and their menu is pretty varied for a steakhouse. 

Honestly, it would have been an good experience if not for the food.

I ordered the ribs off their Table D'Haute menu. Although the ribs weren't the worst I've ever had, they did leave a lot to be desired. Mine were super dry, kind of small, and the sauce that they used just didn't do it for me. I prefer a saltier/smokier sauce, but theirs was weirdly sweet? I don't know. It just wasn't for me.

Their fries and coleslaw were pretty standard, and although it wasn't super expensive, I still expected a bit better for what I paid. All in all, I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sterlings is one of my favourite restaurants. They food here is pretty good! Mash potatoes here are really tasty! 

  The decor inside is to my liking ,but the lighting is a little dark. The prices are a little expensive but I think it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Please don't ever eat here for your own personal health and safety! I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we had a horrific experience. Our waitress did not speak one word of English and was extremely rude to us once she discovered we were Anglophone, the food quality was below average (the crab cakes) especially for the prices and finally the most DISTURBING part was finding a piece of GLASS in my burger meat! I took one bite of my food and instantly felt a sharp piece of broken glass in my mouth. I was terrified. Clearly someone in the kitchen broke something near the serving area and rather than throwing away the food, someone made the disturbing decision to serve it to paying customers. I was sickened and completely disgusted. The manager was apologetic and acknowledged the issue, he seemed embarrassed and offered to give us dessert or replace the meal, however we had already been so shaken up by the event that we decided to leave. The manager understood and told us we did not have to pay for our meals. Oh and the best part was when we decided to leave the restaurant because we had had enough after speaking to the manager and he comp'd our bill, the horrible waitress tried to accuse us of dining and dashing because she did not communicate with him  or us ONCE throughout the entirety of our meal. This was laughable, offensive and an embarrassing way to treat clients who have already been completely turned off by your business. They should be humiliated by their service and the staff that the hire and by the way it is a basic skill in Quebec to communicate bilingual and serve clients in both French and English, just as I do at my job and everyone else in this city does! Be very careful going to Sterlings! I never would have expected to have this experience seeing as the reviews were fairly decent however, they clearly do not follow health and safety basic precautions and you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"We discovered Sterlings after waiting for over 45 minutes at the Keg. We were 3 couples and they we're able to accommodate us right away. We had an amazing time, service and a great atmosphere. My wife had the ribeye and I had roast beef. Both dishes were amazing and honestly was better than the Keg. We were all happy to discover this restaurant and is now definitely our favorite steakhouse! A definate must!"}
{"text":"Food was very basic very expensive no jazz to it . The owner or who ever stares at you and never says hi or thank you . There are holes in the wall that seem to stay and are neglected I had drywall dust fall in my soup. very unhappy!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the nicest dining experiences in Laval, possibly Montreal. The wine selection cant be beat and the steaks are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Nice food, good flavours, well prepared and presented , generous portion, took the tuna salad and did not regret it. Wide selection wine. Professional service. Clean and quite restaurant, not well suited for kids but rather friend gathering, business lunches, prices are 30-40$ per person even with the lunch menu but thats ok fir this category if restaurants. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Un steakhouse en compétition avec celui connu dans le Carrefour Laval à côté. Le service est adéquat et l'ambiance de restaurant chic.

Les entrées sont normaux, mais les pièces de viande sont excellentes. Les fruits de mers n'ont pas été essayés lors de notre dernière visite."}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon medium rare and it was burnt on the outside. Not charred, burnt. My boyfriend had the burger and the meat was completely burnt and dry all the way through. Our fries were cold and under seasoned. We waited almost an hour for our table and then 20 minutes to be served. The service was horrible and I would not come back."}
