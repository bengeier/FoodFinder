{"text":"Had a similar experience to others. Arrived at 6:45 on a Tuesday and were told there was a 35 minute wait. The location is beautiful and will be much-needed competition for the Great Dane, which has been mediocre recently. 

Unfortunately, the staff here weren't very service oriented. After our wait we were seated at a table in the bar area, without an option for dining room seating. There appeared to be booths available. While waiting for a table, we waited over 10 minutes to be served by a bartender. Obviously this is a beer joint, but that's not an excuse for making a weak, flat gin and tonic.

The food was okay, nothing special, especially after long waits to order and receive it. I would disagree with those who compared this to Brasserie V. There isn't any comparison at all. Hopefully they will work out the kinks here and this location will live up to the really nice experience of the milwaukee one."}
{"text":"Not often when I consider eating out 5 stars, but the flavors are great and not too greasy.

The menu satisfied kids, grandma and the rest. That good for food and beverages.

A brand new place in the mall isn't our style but good food is good food.

Bonus is the place is a short walk to Metcalfe's grocery store - the best in Madison."}
{"text":"If you are paying 7.50 for .3 liters of beer, at least the glass shouldn't have 1 1/2 inches of foam on top."}
{"text":"Ugh, lunch today was no bueno.

FWIW, I've been for breakfast twice and those were decent, I got the eggs Benedict and something else that I don't remember. The point is, they were good enough and certainly not  terrible, which is why the sad, soggy, oily mess of a not-a-single tomato, lettuce, onion  or garnish cafe hamburger with salty, cold fries  that I had for lunch today prompted this review.  Far be it from me to turn my nose up at french fries but it had to be done."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The best Bloody Mary's! The staff is very friendly and make you feel comfortable the second you walk in until the moment you leave. So glad they opened in Madison!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am a little biased here as I am a big fan of Belgium Beers - and there is a never ending supply of delicious bottled and draught beers here for me. First, the restaurant is designed so thoughtfully and I just really feel comfortable in the space as all the colors and textures of the design are appealing to me. There are two areas of the restaurant where you can see a tv (for game watchers) from every table - and a third location if away from them if you have no interest. This place has a festive brew-pub vibe to it, but is truly a great place for the whole family. The kid menu portions are very generous and you get vegetables with every option! There is a separate gluten-free menu and several vegan options. I really feel that they have something for everyone to enjoy. personal menu favorites: Goat Cheese/Tomato Bruschetta (tastes like Summer!) Beignets, Café Club, Crab Stuffed Salmon, Quinoa Skillet, Nutella Toast (with pistachios!), and they do a really great job with their Mussels... and Frites!! Try the Frites with the Basil Aioli yummy. Also, very very good Bloody Mary's - and a bunch of different kinds!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is terrific. The food is a mixed bag. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles on my most recent visit. I expected a piece or two of fried chicken with a waffle. And the menu called it \"southern fried chicken\"--which brought to mind images of Paula Deen and buttermilk fried chicken. Instead Cafe Hollander served what appeared to be chicken tenders on top of a waffle drenched in sauce. No finger licking goodness there. 

I sent the dish back and had half of my wife's tasty burger."}
{"text":"*Please understand the low score of this review is based purely on the server* FOOD, BEER, AND RESTAURANT WERE AWESOME!

Four of us were seated at about 9:15pm on Saturday Dec 26 (Restaurant closed at midnight that night).  Our server (Rach K.) has a horrible poker face.  It was quite apparent that her need to go home was more important than our want to have some food and a couple beers.

We ordered cheese curds, one pound of mussels, wings, and four beers.  The food was awesome.  About half way through the food, she dropped off checks without offering more beer.  She seemed annoyed that I ordered another beer, and it quickly became apparent that we were her last table of the night.  If she hadn't made the whole experience uncomfortable by asking what we wanted every two minutes, we would have stayed longer.  Finally after a four more beers, we watched her cheer and pump her arms as she took our checks back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and both times I have been disappointed. This place markets itself on being a beer lover's paradise with all sorts of varieties and speciality brands. They seem to exploit this and use it as an excuse to charge ridiculous prices for small volumes of beer. 

Their Hollander brand IPA is on draught, I ordered a glass of that and when it came I was disappointed in the size, after looking at the menu I learned it was 250 ml and $7. Most bars in Madison it costs $5/$6 for an IPA and you get almost double the volume!! Also lets not forget this is their own brand beer, it's nothing special! 

Then my girlfriend ordered their Christmas ale, also $7 for a tiny glass, to add insult to injury they like to charge for air, see the attached picture. This was taken before she drank anything! What a joke, half the glass was foam. Both barmen did this twice! It's a disgrace, yes the decor and building is cool but there is no justification for this robbery!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance and they have a great menu but there are some issues that need work.  My husband and I stopped in for breakfast recently and were not greeted by the host promptly although the restaurant was not busy. I ordered the real maple syrup for my French toast and although the kitchen was out of it, the server didn't let me know and just assumed I wouldn't mind if she substituted the imitation variety.  Not a huge deal but she should have checked.  My husband's entree didn't come with toast so he ordered a side of it -- I think $1.50 is a little steep for a single slice of bread in a casual restaurant even if it's pretty good bread. It takes quite a while for the food to come out of the kitchen -- I think weekday breakfast and lunch service needs to be fairly brisk because people who work may not have a long time to linger over a meal.  Both of our meals were very good but I think you can get a very serviceable breakfast in Madison for less than the $13 for each of our entrees.  I don't mind shelling out the cash for an exceptional meal or if I have no other option, such as at a hotel, but if I have a choice I will exercise it.  I'd rather mention these concerns directly to a host or manager but no one asked how our experience was aside from the waitress asking about the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander is great! Great atmosphere and delicious food. 

They have the best bloody Mary's hands down! (And I have had a a lot of bloody Mary's)"}
{"text":"After 2 visits, I can say I'm not going to hurry back.  Had breakfast one weekday morning about a week or two after it opened and the flies were so bad I don't even remember what I ate.  The manager must have finally noticed and came over to apologize saying they had had the garage doors open the night before and \"that must have let a lot of flies in.\"  All I did was swat and wave at them to keep them off our table and food.  Anyway....returned recently for dinner and unimpressed again.  After two mixups on the beer order, they finally brought the right ones along with the cheese curds we ordered.  The cheese curds were burned. I ate one and said, that's it. When I left for the restroom, my husband asked the waitress if that's how they usually were served and she said no, and she thought they were kind of burned when she brought them out!!  So those did get replaced.  I ordered the quiche Lorraine and it was pretty good; the side salad was great and the whole thing at a bargain price in my opinion.  My husband liked his creole sandwich as well.  Water glasses were not even refilled once, but I was just tired of asking for something else.  Read in the State Journal review that people were waiting for one hour to 90 minutes for a table and just can't figure out why.  A very similar menu to the Great Dane right across the parking lot and much worse service."}
{"text":"Big fan of the original MKE location, so when I heard it was coming to Madison I totally freaked out. Went there last night for the fish fry and I was VERY impressed. This ranks right up there with the best fish fry joints in Madison. The regular beer battered cod was just the right amount of crisp on the outside with a nice flaky interior, super fresh. Coleslaw was a revelation with a simple sesame dressing instead of a heavy mayonnaise based sauce - it cut right through the richness of the rest of the food. Tartar sauce was awesome as well (with possibly some blue cheese blended in?). And there's nothing else I can say about the fries other then pure perfection. The portions were very large, so for the first time in a while I ended up taking some food home to go - I don't normally do that at restaurants anymore.

Beer selection is fantastic, if not a tad pricier than say Dexter's. Service was excellent as well. I was having a hard time picking a beer from their massive selection and the waiter recommended one that worked out really nice with the meal. He was more than happy to pour small samples of beer (no cost) to help us decide on one. There were some times when the waiters were kind of scrambling around, but this is not unusual for such a new restaurant. Still, I never felt like I was being ignored and the service was fast.

Oh and don't forget to order same appetizers, their \"Dutch Bitterballen\" were incredible with the curry ketchup. Sounds odd? Trust me, they're not. Head on over and check them out for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Starters have consistently come 1min before meal, so not really a starter.  Coffee is pretty bad.  Service is mediocre."}
{"text":"Food was tasty - some nice vegetarian offerings. But our beer, a Radler which I can buy a can of for $3, was way overpriced at about half a can for $8. Unreasonable for a drink with only a couple percent alcohol. Our server was kind and attentive."}
{"text":"I resisted coming to Hollander for a few months as I know them from Milwaukee.  Benelux is one of our favorites, but the Hollander in Tosa is a dog, and I figured they were going to reproduce themselves in Madison.  My other half pushed me into trying the Hollander last Saturday.  I knew it would be a zoo, as a new place on the weekends is bound to be overrun.  I was not mistaken, although they managed us very well.  However, I discovered that, because it was their \"brunch\" time, I could not get Moules Frites as a menu item.  Any other time but then.

OK, but the choice of what to serve is certainly theirs.  We were nicely served.  I can't even remember the waiter's name, but he was personable and not rushed.  Beers were good.

  Now for the rest.  Wife is a frites fan.  We don't do deep fried at home, but she loves good French fries, always tested against some we ate from a roadside truck outside Verdun, which are her definition of perfect.  These were not.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that most fries here in the US originate in Idaho as some great fat squooshy things.  The cottage fries on my plate were the same thing.  A little bit of crisp on the outside and a whole lot of mashed potatoes in the middle.  Our restauranteurs should learn about the firm varieties available from their local locavore purveyors (try German Butterballs or other more dense varieties).  The Chef from Gray's does buy from some of them, as I have seen him in the market.

As I couldn't order the mussels, I decided for a classic Eggs Benedict.  The English muffin was perfect as were the poached eggs.  The Hollandaise sauce, however, probably came out of a bag for fast prep.  It was tasteless and about as synthetic as you can get without becoming poisonous.

We want Hollander to succeed.  Their music was fortunately not of the head banger variety we have experienced at their counterpart, and we wish them the best.  Work on the frites, and next time we will come in the middle of the week in the dead of winter when most of the public is hiding."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cafe Hollander multiple times, for both breakfast and lunch, and have had mixed experiences. While I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, the food has been mediocre (at best) for the majority of my visits--if you're considering it for breakfast or brunch, I think there are significantly better options near the Square or on Willy Street. This restaurant would never make any of my Best Of lists for Madison, mostly due to its inconsistency. Overall, I find myself wanting to like it (because of the fun setting) more than I actually do."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, fabulous gluten free food and beer selection. I only didn't give it 5* because the cocktails are a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place!  Brunch is fantastic!  Beer selection is decent enough.  However, the hostess or at least the process for seating groups is primitive.  The waiting line/queue is released/notified in groups so it's a mad dash to get tables before others.  A line may form but will be largely ignored as people have a superiority compelled that they should be served first.  The hostess does nothing to create order.

 Also, they send families with babies and strollers to seat upstairs, slowing down the process further.  There is an elevator to go up but it is incredibly slow."}
{"text":"Stopped to check things out after brunch and try a few beers.  Loud music probably intentional to keep people moving through rather than hanging out. I expected more all the way around. Taps were way overpriced for the size of the pour (both beer and wine), didn't eat but didn't see or smell anything that looked worth the prices. The bar was cluttered, not obviously clean, and had 6 bartenders milling about. Observed food en route to a table get passed 3 times from server to server then held during 10 minute conversation before getting delivered. Bar staff appear to be a few folks from another local place with unfriendly service if not a regular, seems similar already at Hollander. Won't be back. Seems like another contrived restaurant trying to lure people with themes and gimmicks rather than quality product and service."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to our neighborhood.  The place is beautiful, very cool, welcoming...love the outdoor seating.  Having experienced Cafe Hollander in MKE, I think it'll continue to trive.  A few suggestions:  Menu is very diverse...keep shaking it up when you can.  We tried ordering a cocktail that apparently was no longer available (even though it was on the cocktail list provided and the ingredients were easy---Hollander has a huge bar).  When we asked why we still couldn't get the drink, we were told, \"We just don't do that.\"  ????  Strange.  Hoping they don't get \"too big for their britches\" that their customer service doesn't start to slip.  Drinks aren't cheap.  I think the food is pretty reasonable for the portion sizes.  And if you're a beer drinker, this place is such a welcome addition to the near-West side.  Totally beats the old, stodgy look and feel of The Great Dane."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has a nice ambiance, convenient location, etc. Unfortunately, I have two major problems with it. 

First, they are really, really, really, bad with food allergies. We've been there three times and staff pretty much doesn't take food allergies seriously and says there's nothing they can do. Keeping peanuts away from our group's food so that no one dies seems like a pretty easy request. When we asked if they could prepare buttered noodles or something super basic and make sure that was ok (we understand a lot of items are somewhat pre made or use similar stations) and they still said no guarantees. Super disappointing. And, yes, we followed up with management and they didn't care either.  

Second, their food is inconsistent. We have had big swings in food quality the few times we have went. Sometimes it was great. Other times the same basic food left us questioning why we thought it was good the time before and what happened?"}
{"text":"The food was really fine.  The copious portion of jambalaya was certainly a European rendition of New Orleans and that's fun!  There was plenty of duck confit instead of chicken, a wonderful spicy serious frankfurter as andouille, perfectly cooked ~60 ct. shrimp, over a little jasmine rice and topped with a Creole-inspired sauce Espagnol.  I regret eating at the bar, though.  The ordering was rushed, the refills slow despite not many patrons, and no receipt was presented.  Afterwards I asked for it and saw that the server had claimed to have tendered less cash than I paid.  My change was correct, but officially my tip was reported as much less than I left so either the cash drawer was going to be over or ???"}
{"text":"Food was reasonable but a bit overpriced (You charge extra for mayo/aioli for the frites? Really!) it took about 20minutes after being seated to place our order. Food arrived about 25 minutes after that. The order was not completely correct (I assume that one of the 4 or 5 people handling the table got confused) but at this point I didn't have time to wait for a replacement. I think I will stick with Gates and Brovi...better service...much better food."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this terrific addition to the Madison dining scene. If you know the Lowlands Group of restaurants in Milwaukee, you are already rejoicing. If you are new to that group of restaurants, now you know which places to seek out the next time you visit Milwaukee and where to go the next time you want a great experience on the west side of Madison. The headlines: 
-incredibly beautiful location with two levels and essentially garage doors instead of windows that will open completely in nice weather
-terrific, informed and genuinely nice servers that can't be beat anywhere else
-fun, yummy menu that you will want to try, try again for lunch, brunch and dinner
-a welcoming community of food/beer/bike lovers that makes you want to buy a t-shirt (how often does that happen?) ... in a word, HAPPINESS!

I think this place has a lot to live up to, and they are already on their way. First, the standard that Hollander, Bavaria, Centraal and Benelux in Milwaukee has set means that the bar is high for food, service and atmosphere. Second, people will compare Hollander-Hilldale to both Brasserie V (for Belgian food/beer) and Great Dane (the \"other\" Hilldale go-to restaurant). I suspect that when you read Yelp reviews over time that many will say that they like BV or GD better and Hollander is not their thing, or as in my case I have been waiting for a better Brasserie V experience and a better Hilldale option than Great Dane. So depending on who you are and what you like, if you adore BV and GD, you will be hard to impress and will probably find faults with Hollander. For me it is long overdue and I have been tired of the many flaws at BV and GD but I always had to settle for them. But no more!

My husband and I went to Hollander first during the soft opening. When all proceeds went to charity, folks! Who does that?! So even though they were open and charging full price for their menu, they were giving it all away. That should tell you a lot about the company. They only opened on Monday (10/19/15). Monday! Which means all the reviews you have been reading at the end of October 2015 are about a brand-new place which is finding its feet with all new staff in a built-from-the-ground-up location. Amazing! Our second visit was with a large group of friends to introduce them all to the new place that we are so excited about. Two very different experiences but a lot of happiness to report.

During the soft opening we had dinner late on Friday, sat in the bar and felt it was pretty quiet and relaxed. APRIL did a great job serving us--we can't wait to see her again! She was helpful and knowledgeable and had a lovely thoughtful energy that will make her great at her job. We loved the meatloaf (a little spicy), and the potato chip beer batter fish fry was amazing... admittedly for those who lean more towards the batter than the fish when enjoying a fish fry but that's me! Might consider ordering a veg on the side for the meatloaf and extra tartar for the fish fry, but the interesting coleslaw and the side of pumpernickel were nice touches. The beer menu takes a little getting used to, because you locate the beer you want on the first few pages and then refer to the page number next to it for more info like the price. Be sure to do that, as prices can vary a lot on a beer list this huge.

A week later we brought a large group to enjoy the new place, and EMMA took care of us wonderfully. There were plenty of hiccups and she managed them all with such sincerity and helpfulness that they didn't impact our experience much at all. For example, she was considerate to our request that we break up the checks instead of getting one check for the whole group. When only some people's food came out first and we had to wait for the rest, she was attentive and apologetic, and yet we were there to hang out and we had quickly received appetizers already so we didn't care much at all. Or when we inquired about the seasonal dessert but they were out of it for the night, we ended up with the brownie skillet all around, which was \"OMG\" worthy for sure! The one thing to try (besides mussels/frites) that would be a nod to the Benelux region is the bitteballen, a tasty fried app that reminds us of Holland."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I wish I could comment on the quality of the food but when we ordered a burger we were told by 2 bartenders that substitutions, additions, or subtractions were not allowed.   So I asked \"I have to have mayo on my burger?\"  He said \"Yes, it comes as is\".   Ummm.... you realize I'm trying to give you money right?

I won't be back.   Madison has too many great spots to waste my time on this place."}
{"text":"We had to wait 1.5 hours for our meal and the food was poor cold.  The beer was flat.  All the offered was a small cone of fries for our table of 8 which was insulting.

The staffing is not adequate for a restaurant this large.

Stay away."}
{"text":"For the most part friendly staff. Cool decor and atmosphere. Not so cool--the pull down \"open air\" gates that were open to attract MANY flies in; the brutally strong house coffee that even I, a chronic coffee drinker who needs it strong for the caffeine, couldn't tolerate; cold porridge...that came in a skillet? My significant other also commented that the tortilla for the wrap was hard to cut through. Pricey and overhyped, probably won't be back. Plenty of other places in Madison to dine for brunch."}
{"text":"Phew. If you're a cafe in Wisconsin that serves $10 cheese curds, it helps if you don't deep fry them so long the cheese disintegrates. Service was friendly but slow. We received our food before our drinks and by the time the coffee drinks arrived they were lukewarm. With so many good food options in Madison, you can do much, much better than Cafe Hollander at this price point."}
{"text":"Come for the European beer selection but not necessarily for the food/service. Although our waiter was personable, they brought me the wrong dish and one person in our party got her food much later than everyone else. My burger was dry and completely uninspired, with so many beer/gastropubs in Madison, you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pros: cool atmosphere, cool bar, lots on tap. 
Cons: cranky staff, food is so-so

I rarely send food back, but we got a soft pretzel and sent it back due to the raw dough in the middle. FOUR sendbacks later we got a cooked one. Never seen anything like it before... It's a pretzel, it can't be that difficult. 

I would go back any day to drink. Might be a while before I eat there again."}
{"text":"This place has been a great experience thus far.  I have only been there a handful of times, but on each of those occasions, the food has been wonderful, and the staff somehow manages to keep on top of things with a positive attitude even with the large size and crowds that Hollander commands.  I've also only just begun to explore their vast beer selection, but for the few I have tried, I have not been disappointed.   There are some minor downsides to this place (patio furniture seating in some sections due to the style and atmosphere of the place) and high noise level, but overall, eating at Hollander Cafe is an enjoyable and recommended experience."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Madison and came here after shopping. Went on a Friday night and there was no wait, but still very lively! My fiancé was amazed at the beer selection! We enjoyed our drinks as well as our food! Our server Mo was fantastic! He knew all about the beer and was super friendly and personable! We will definitely frequent this place thanks to the huge beer selection and great service"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Hilldale mall. Amazing brunch, great food in general. 5/5"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere!  Brunch on sunday is great and when they open all the doors it feels like you are sitting outside.  Food is great and they have a large drink menue.  Definitley recommend Cafe Hollander."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast. The food was overpriced, eggs with Lawry's seasoning(?), beignets were little balls of dough that had been rolled in confectioner's sugar. At least the chocolate sauce accompanying them was really great. 


The WORST THING was that the waiter rounded up our friends' bill - without any mention that he was doing that! (It was less than 50 cents, but that should never have happened.Not even sure it's legal.)

Our friends (one owns a successful business) said they would never return to Cafe Hollander. Neither will we."}
{"text":"We waited a long time to get an outpost of this Milwaukee-based Belgian beer bar.  Was it worth the wait?  YES! I avoided trekking to Hilldale until after the holidays based on hearing this place was jam-packed from open to close.  We stopped in on a chilly, late-afternoon in January and found a couple of seats at the ample bar.  No food for us, we went straight for the stellar beer list.  Be warned, the beer list is the size of a book, however it's well-organized and even has a little beer-education for those unfamiliar with Belgian beers :) Our bartender was attentive and quick to answer questions and offer samples of many styles.  I'm hoping to go back for some mussels, as they looked awesome!"}
{"text":"Outstanding decor and ambiance. Food and service was average. Despite my breakfast stating 3 eggs, it came with 2, both well overcooked. Generally a noisy place. Lots of hard surfaces that echo sound. Lots of kids add to the sound level. Looks like a great summer spot as the place is loaded with glass garage doors that open up the outdoors in warm weather. Will be back to try some of the beers."}
{"text":"Good addition to Hilldale!  This place will be great during the summer as well with the open air concept and the upstairs patio.  Offers a menu that will rival the Great Dane (in terms of other restaurants close by).  Cafe Hollander offers an extensive beer selection with a lot of Belgian brews on tap and in the bottle.

Another great brunch spot for Madison and this one is great for those living on the near west side not having to venture downtown.  After a long saturday morning run I had the Quinoa skillet which was loaded with flavor... a great fall breakfast dish."}
{"text":"My wife were going for a special lunch because of others recommendations.  When we were seated we noticed there were flies in the place.  We placed our orders for salmon and jambalaya.  When the food arrived so did the flies.  There were everywhere--on us, the table and the food.  It got pretty intense.  The waitress said it because the doors were open earlier.  When we left we also told the manager about their problem.  Driving away we both remarked, if the flies were this bad in the restaurant imagine how bad they must be in the kitchen.

In sum, the food was good but the place was awful.  We won't be back, there are just too many restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing food (the grilled cheese OMG!!), incredible beer selection, knowledgeable friendly staff. There is always a wait on the weekends but they always over-estimate the wait... so don't be turned off by the 45 minute wait! It has always been only 20-25 minutes for us. And it is worth it, I promise!"}
{"text":"We keep coming back. Beautiful bar and fun atmosphere! Let you request where you want to sit. Food delicious and hot! Good parking."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the place was packed - the interior of the restaurant was very appealing - roof top area would be great on a nice day. Extensive beer list with great selection of tap beers. Ordered burgers and a Benedict egg dish. Burgers were ordered medium rare/medium and came well done and one burned. Sweetie fries came cold - not even luke warm. Egg dish was vey average and only half was consumed- potatoes with this dish were also burned and cold. Lunch for 3 with 1 tap beer and 1 cappuccino came to $60 (one burger was $17). Would never order the overpriced, below average food again but would stop by for a beer on tap."}
{"text":"Food: Sumptuous. The Mac and Cheese was a one way ticket to Eat-aly. The peppers reacted with the pasta in such a way that elevated the dish into the lower stratosphere. The blackberry turkey sandwich was equally delightful to the tastebuds. 

Beer: We just ordered the radler, a great choice if you aren't into beer so much. 

Service: Quick, but our waiter left us feeling as if we were missing a certain level of satisfaction. 

Ambience: Restaurant was cold, but the decor was simple yet tasteful. We would have preferred a nice backstory for the portrait of the man on the wall. Lighting in the bathroom was very poor. 

Overall: Delightful and plan on coming back again!"}
{"text":"What a shame... After enjoying Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee, I was excited to give the Madison location a try. The location is great with plenty of parking close by, the atmosphere is very hip and the building even has garage doors on multiple levels that may make for a fun place to go on a nice summer day.

The food is pretty amazing...  My wife had and I both had burgers both of which were excellent, same with the giant soft pretzel appetizer and dipping sauces. Unfortunately the service was not acceptable.  Although the staff was friendly they are inattentive.  My wife and I waited almost 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our table and order drinks and just as long for them to reach the table.  For a brand that seems to be proud of their beer selection they are serving \"250ml\" glasses of their speciality house brews loaded with foam at upwards of $7.00 each leaving you feeling underwhelmed at a terrible value.

Bottom line... The food is amazing however, considering their location is in an upscale area it's a moot point.  There are plenty of other pubs that have better service, are a better value, and keep the beer flowing in this price range most notably Great Dane!  Hop Cat, Broach, Brasserie V, are also better options and Free House Pub is not too far away either..."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on 11/20/16. Waiter very attentive, food was quick and tasty. Highly recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Madison restaurant choices. The ambiance is a modern industrial type that feels warm and comfortable and also has surprisingly good acoustics. There are two levels and several different areas to sit in, which gives great flexibility depending on how you feel. There's even glass garage doors and a glass roof that open up in nicer weather! The food and drink menus are as good as the space, with a solid variety of choices. The beer menu is extensive, including types for real connoisseurs. I've eaten here several times and the food quality has been consistent and, I'd say, top notch for this type of eatery. And to top it off, they throw in a few surprising menu choices that have great flavor and make their menu a little more special than you might expect to find. And yes, the staff have all been fantastic!"}
{"text":"There were some ups - and some big downs.

I know Café Hollander has not been open that long, and so I came in knowing that they might not have everything down quite yet. When we arrived we were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait -  understandable for a Saturday night. We added our name and it turns out they use this cool app so you can track your place in line - we were able to do some shopping instead of waiting around in the lobby for our table (no room in the bar). Then they text you when your table is ready.

Then, the big down. We sat at our table for a good 20 minutes before anyone even stopped by to say hello, and that was after I snagged a nearby server to ask. Now, I understand that things get busy on a Saturday night - however either not checking in on your table for 20 minutes, or not having section assignments down is just sloppy. If we hadn't waited for so long, we'd have just left. I kind of assumed we would be offered some kind of compensation for the excessive wait (which would have gone a ways to smoothing things over) - but it was just a quick 'oh sorry'.

Our drink orders took quite a while to arrive - which was likely due to the high volume. I noticed there were a ton of tables open, so they were not at full capacity. I'm hoping they will get things together better before they think about filling up all their tables.

The beer list is really extensive - so if you are a fan of beer, this would be a great place for you. I liked that there were flavor descriptions in the menu, since it can be difficult to know if you might like something just based on a name. However, I did have some free beer coupons to use, and didn't know they were only available on certain options. I would have thought maybe they would give me a little wiggle - again based on the timing, but no.

The food was good - and the reason I would come back despite the service. I started with the tomato soup which was excellent, there were chunks of basil and tomato which made it fairly hearty for a tomato soup. I had the shrimp sandwich - it was good, but couple have used a little more sauce. The sweet potato fries were excellent, I got sriracha mayo to dip them in and it was a good choice. My friend enjoyed her grilled cheese, though she said the bread was extremely hard.

All in all, I'll give them another chance. The food and beer list were good enough that I will come back, but it will likely be either on a week night or after a couple months to give them more time to get their timing issues smoothed out."}
{"text":"The setup of the place is awesome, totally European themed with stuff from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany and that region. Food was very good but a little too expensive. Service was average but I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Hollander quite a few times (both in MKE and more frequently at the Hilldale location). Overall the space is nice - good for a group or a one-on-one and when it's nice outside, opening the large windows provides great atmosphere. The beer list is primarily why I've come here but the food is generally satisfying. 

That being said, I find their service to be the aspect they're lacking in - for example, not labeling four-packs of beers and then guessing which beer was which and most recently, bringing the wrong dish entirely. Today I was there with a friend and we had waited quite a while to be seated so when I was served the wrong kind of Liege waffle I didn't even bother saying anything (ordered the Fresh Berry, received the one with cherries) because it would've taken forever and disrupted the flow of lunch. 

I also didn't bother because because the waffle on the whole was just plain disappointing - didn't even finish it because it just wasn't worth it. I've had quite a few different Liege waffles in various Belgian cities and this bears little resemblance to the actual 'authentic' Liege waffle, despite what Cafe Hollander's menus says. In addition to the consistency, the other main distinguishing feature of a Liege waffle are the bursts of crystallized sugar which were completely lacking in this waffle. I'd rather have a 2 euro waffle from a little street cart in Belgium any day than pay $10 for that dry, tasteless hunk of carbohydrate. 

The rest of the brunch menu looked good and the several dishes I've had from the weekday regular lunch menu have been great - but if you're going to say you serve authentic Liege waffles, keep working on that."}
{"text":"Let's start of with the atmosphere was beautiful , the service was decent because the place is new the servers seemed kinda lost at some points. 

The food was overall good. I ordered the Smokey burger, and my friend ordered the mushroom risotto we felt the food lack on seasoning especially the mushroom risotto though the fried Calamari we one of the best I have had. 

If Cafe Hollander improves on the seasoning and minor errors with the food they can reach for more stars I'll be happy to come back and try it again"}
{"text":"I hate this place. I was so excited when I got there, it looked very cute I think I just need to give it another chance. I got the avocado toast....THERE WAS LIKE NO AVOCADO that's the main reason I'm feeling disappointed and empty right now. That and the small portions....It was minimal avocado with a boatload of arugula. Their fries were chewy and not the best, seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile. The free water was lit I guess"}
{"text":"Recently came here for lunch with an old friend and had a good time.  The food was very good and the waitress didn't seem to mind that we stayed for awhile just catching up and talking (they weren't busy at all).  The waitress was friendly and attentive and didn't make us feel rushed at all.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"When we got there they told us it would be 30-45 min wait, which tells you how busy they were. It wasn't that long. The food choices were unique and what we got was delicious. We started with cheese curds, which were very good and the sauce was excellent. I ordered the Belt and A for my entree. It was huge and delicious! I could only eat half. Price was approx $12 for my sandwich. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. A good menu for children but a little on the pricier side. The Buttery Belgian burger is delicious. Frites could use a little work, I'm more of a fan of fresh cut fries and these don't taste fresh. Roasted Garlic Aioli could use a lot more garlic and flavor."}
{"text":"Good service, nice ambiance, pretty good bloody Mary's...but brunch was inedible. I had eggs Benedict, but only ate a quarter of my meal...poor quality ingredients and breakfast potatoes that were wayyyyyy overcooked! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The European beer selection is outstanding and the food is great as well. It's very cool space with plenty of outdoor areas. The only downside is that there are tons of flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Place has only been open a short time.  Liked the decor.  Very rustic.  Also, very loud and hard to carry on a conversation.  This will probably be very different when it's warm outside and the \"garage doors\" are open letting it be an open air bar.

I ordered the sliders and the bitterballion and was not impressed with either.  The sliders were overcooked and very dry.  Even the potatoe bun was dry and hard.  The sandwiches had very little flavor.  The bitterballion at first bite was good, but after one, they were way too salty.  The sauces served with them did not have much flavor.  I had the garlic aiola and was not impressed.  We actually commented to the server our distate for both items, and we did receive a free dessert.

My friends had the salmon, a chicken burger and a wrap, and they were all pleased with their entrees.  All of them had beer with their meals, and were shocked at the amount of foam that was served on each beer.  The pours did not fill the glasses and the foam was excessively high.  They were all commenting on the pours.  I had a Bacardi and diet, and must say, I could barely taste the Bacardi in the drink.  Must have been a lite pour.

As I said we received a free dessert because of our comment on the appetizers.  It was a brownie with salted carmel pretzel icecream.  I'm not a fan of desserts, but it was a good dessert.  Very flavorful!

Eventhough I was not impressed with my appetizers, I must say the service was amazing.  The staff was constantly filling the water glasses and coming by routinely to see if we needed anything.  Our server was very friendly and outgoing.  The only negative here, was that those bringing beer/drinks to the table had difficulty in locating which table the beverages were supposed to go to.

We did walk upstairs and outside and found an amazing deck!! Can't wait to go back when it is warm and try the outside deck.  It would probably be beneficial to have a bar on the deck since it is so large.  Outdoor firepits or heaters might also be an option, as had they been out there tonight, people probably would have been out there since it was in the low 60's/upper 50s.

I will give this place a second chance, but probably not until spring when the doors are opened up and the fresh air is let in to help with the noise."}
{"text":"Two trips:  first with two friends, which was such a rewarding experience that today I brought back seven more.  Everyone was thrilled with the outstanding food and service in a congenial atmosphere.  One thought the burger the best he's ever had (and that's about all he eats when we go out).  The Quiche Lorraine is heavenly.  Appetizers creative and delicious.   Am eager to go back for brunch, which I've heard is awesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Server was slow and lacked knowledge about what was on tap and the characteristics of those beers. Took 50 min to get my beer, after lots of back and forth between the server & bar. I ordered 3 beers that the server said were on tap only to find out that they weren't. On the 4th beer I asked for a sample first and it took 15 min to get the sample and 15 min to get my beer. Once the beers were served, he promptly forgot about us. We had to go looking for him in order to settle our bill."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast this weekend. We were able to get in without a wait around 1030 AM on a Saturday.  We ordered the apple, brie and pomegranate toast.  It was quite good but pretty heavy.  I ordered the black rice bowl.  It included two poached eggs, veggies and a soy sauce.  It was very salty.  My friend had good things to say about the bloody Mary.  My chai latte was pretty standard.  A solid standby if you are in the area. I will give it a try for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is good for pub food. High quality, fresh ingredients. Fun atmosphere. Perfect for large groups."}
{"text":"We ate at Cafe Hollander on Halloween weekend 2017.  Everything from the ambience to the service to the food was exceptional.  A few of us ordered the messy skillet (or something like that) which we all loved.  Bloody Mary's are the best in town too!  Definitely one of my favorite stops in Madison."}
{"text":"So disappointed by this place. It looks great and I loved the feel of the place upon entry. But everything fell apart.

First, we told our server that our daughter has a bad egg allergy, and asked which items on the kids menu were safe. He laconically listed a few that \"should\" be okay. \"Should or are?\" we asked, and politely explained that the difference was the difference between going home happy or going to the emergency room. Unmoved, he held by saying one or two things \"should\" be okay. So we asked him to check, trying to be as nice as possible. He came back saying his supervisor also thought these two dishes \"are probably okay,\" but he could check with the kitchen if we really needed him to, making it clear that this would be an imposition. We asked for him to do so, then ordered.

Our drinks came after our food. My wife's cocktail came in a beer glass \"because they're out of cocktail glasses,\" and though my (expensive) beer was meant to be 330ml, it was half-poured in a 250ml glass, so I pointed this out. After a long wait, a guy said, yes, it was wrong, and I'd get $1 off on the bill ... even though the beer was $9. I said I'd rather the beer, and he returned much later with a thimble full of extra. Dude was basically trolling us. Even though we were being very nice (daughter was there: didn't want to make a scene).

Oh, and my wife's and my food came before the kid's. The food was okay, but way overpriced.

You know, I like that the average quality of restaurants in Madison is high, so it's hard to go badly wrong. But Cafe Hollander is a hole. Drive-through at the McDonald's across the street would have been better."}
{"text":"Good food.
Amazing beer menu.
However, the absolute worst draft pours I've ever seen. Literally, 75% of the beers I observed during nearly 1.5 hours at the bar were only poured only 2/3 full. I switched to bottles out of protest."}
{"text":"If you want good Belgian food in a pleasant atmosphere go to Brasserie B. Had high expectations and felt disappointed. Food was over priced and came out lukewarm. Beer list is long and confusing, atmosphere was cacophonous and poorly lit (upstairs). Service was kind of unfriendly. Great Dane is a better bet just around the corner."}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere. It's nice, new and everything is great except...the food is just mediocre (not bad at all but just OK) and it certainly doesn't match the price. I have had the Seafood Saute twice now. The taste was actually good (not excellent) the problem was that it was barely warm and pricy!"}
{"text":"I guess the question is what was I expecting? If the approach was just American beer bar in think I would have been fairly happy with their pub grub. The thing is the build out was done so well with a motif that takes my wandering soul to the spring one day classic bike races of The Benelux. Tshirts with Eddie Merck orange, bikes hanging from the wall and signs peppered in Flemish and French. I was ready for a belge experience and that surface level is where it all ended. Yes they have Belgian beers and an impressive list that I actually found hard to follow and I'm a beer dude. They also have moule frites - but those frites are just fries and for surely not double fried. They have dipping sauces but surprisingly no straight up mayo. Most of the menu is actually dominated by burgers and sandwiches of reg american pub grub fare, but at much higher prices. In the end I was smitten with the style, but annoyed at the lack of attention to the menu."}
{"text":"Yum- went for sunday breakfast/brunch.  Ryan our server was great and very attentive. liked my food & bloody marry."}
{"text":"Super cool place to hang out. Like sitting at the bar and having a drink. Love the design and ambiance. I had a beet salad and it was pretty good. The kids' plates were the highlight - bento style - fruit, veggie, starch and main."}
{"text":"A very fun date night!  We wanted something that felt special, but we did want to keep it casual.  This place was perfect!"}
{"text":"Very attractive restaurant with an impressive beer selection. Very large portions of fatty food (I haven't decided yet if this is a positive or negative comment). Went for brunch. Even though it was busy we were seated immediately. My wife loved the apple toast (and the toast concept in general): it was multi-grain bread topped with Brie cheese, apples, pomegranate seeds and a spicy honey glaze. All menu items have beer pairings. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends to Cafe Hollander during the soft launch.  There were a few minor service hiccups getting started (to be expected on first day).  The server, other staff, food, and the great restaurant environment quickly made up for it.

They have done a great job with the buildout of the restaurant space.  Lots of windows, and cozy spaces.  Everyone in our party was very happy with their food.  Burgers, sandwiches, frites, the Belgium Bread, beers and cider were all delicious.  I had the grilled cheese with bacon and soup, which was very tasty.  Finally, we shared two desserts, the pecan pie, and the brownie skillet.  Both were also very good.

All in all, this will be a great addition to Madison, and the near west side!  It will be a great place to each lunch or dinner, or just grab a beer and watch the game."}
{"text":"Good Belgium's beer selection but the food is just okay.  It is normally pretty busy, but the service is always good. We go every once in a while but it is not the first choice normally.  It is a solid standby though."}
{"text":"Who puts fried chicken fingers in their Chicken and Waffles? I mean, it was delicious chicken fingers. Flavorful, all white meat, and crispy shell, but a head-scratcher nonetheless. Not sure if they are trying to be hipsters or is this gross cultural appropriation?

It's too bad because the space itself is beautiful and unlike any other restaurant I've dined in and around Madison. We sat near the sidewalk from Macy's facing the entire wall of glass, that in the summertime can be opened like a garage door.

The waffle is a masterpiece though; gritty like it was made from cornmeal, it contained pieces of red peppers and golden corn.

Service was sporadic. I admire our waitress for her ability to recall our order without a pen and a pad, but she lacked in follow-through with filing water glasses as needed or bring the right amount of boxes for leftovers (eyeballing four half eaten plates, she brought us one large box).

Their gift card system is a little silly. The hostess gives you a blank card and envelope, but you have to take it to the bar to complete the transaction by loading it with the amount you want on there. Seems like a 1st world problem, unless it's a packed around dinner time and the single bartender can't keep with with the patrons around the bar."}
{"text":"Inconsistent food quality. I've had amazing and not so amazing dinners here (often the same item). They do have great kids meals served bento style with fruits and veggies/ranch."}
{"text":"We walked up on a Sunday around 3pm and were told there was a 20 min wait. This was really confusing as there was about 40% open tables in the restaurant. We waited with other parties who were ahead of us and no one was getting seated, this was while we were looking at dozens of open tables. We left-couldn't imagine the wait for the actual food. The staff at the front didn't bother to explain the wait-the whole thing was just odd."}
{"text":"At least 4 stars.  Wonderful food and environment.  Staff was informative and attentive.  Layout is fantastic with a lot of natural light."}
{"text":"The new and old mix of decor and the unusual menu makes me keep coming back to this great grub spot! My favorite burger has a flavorful hunk of pork belly on top of an already juicy burger! Highly recommend to anyone stopping by or who lives in the Madison or surrounding area!"}
{"text":"So far so good. Delicious seasonal craft cocktails? check. Attractive and attentive waitstaff? So far after five visits, check. Delicious Breakfast and Brunch options? Praise the sweet baby Jesus, check. Dinner Menu? Um...well, hopefully they will work on that. The variety for late day or evening meals is quite limited in scope. In the meantime enjoy the scenery of the lovely ladies and gents who work there enjoy the great, open space and on nice days they open up the glass windowed walls to let you take in the fresh air. It packs it in quickly so you may not want to go at peak times such as right after 9-5pm work time or on Sundays after folks get out of church. The staff is great but during busy times even they have limited resources. Cafe Hollander also has a nice selection of cool, fairly priced tee shirts and I bought one of those and wear it often. I don't live close by Cafe Hollander but it really says something when I will go out of my way to drive to an establishment like this. I put \"no\" for good for kids because I don't believe young children belong in establishments like this for people going to pay a premium for a dining experience. Leave your kids at home or go to IHOP or Perkins. M'kay?"}
{"text":"I left feeling that I could have gotten better food elsewhere for less. The general atmosphere struck me as fake and yuppie. Oh well."}
{"text":"Soccer with the volume on, happy husband. Tasty Quinoa skillet and Ommegang, happy wife.

Big open space, friendly staff, good food. Right near the newly opened upscale section of the mall for a premium, if pricy, post brunch activity.

A win!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to for kid free meals. The beer menu is now very condenses with no more descriptions of the beer (I'm here to try new thinks and want to know what I'm getting into before $15/glass).  I asked if they still had the detailed one. No. I asked if they could tell me more about the sours. No. The lighting was so dim, we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menu. Food is still good, but not worth it if you want to adventure drink."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and sister for dinner because we were in the area. Not sure what kind of food they're known for but definitely a beer place. I decided to get the Jambalaya thinking it was going to have some good spice and kick to it and big plate for $17. When I got the plate the presentation was good, very appetizing looking. Mashed and mixed the rice around and took my first bite. Okay, not bad, took another bite and was expecting more spice but that was it. I wish it had a little more spice and flavor to it but I don't think it was worth $17. There was plenty of sausage and chicken but only 3 shrimp. Would I go back? Yes but try their burgers or sandwich. Overall great place to go with people to sit and chat."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in Madison in a while.  Place has a Bloody Mary menu with 6 different varieties (that just about says it all!).  Excellent atmosphere and ambience.  Food, although a little pricey, is well worth it.  Service was also very good.  I need to get here for dinner if breakfast can be this good."}
{"text":"This big, noisy restaurant seems to always be full. I'm trying hard to keep this above a 2 star. The decor is kitschy, I think appealing to hipsters for now? But only in decor. My experience with Cafe Hollander's food was average at best, based on the mac and cheese, which was rich but oily, and a sandwich resembling a ABLT, which was very wet, bland, and fell apart. Not my favorite side dishes. 

The true crime is the bar scene...understaffed, overpriced, and underpoured. Prior to visiting, I saw photos of half poured beers and was nervous but thought it must be the type of beer there ordered. No. I had two beers, as did my partner and most others in tow. All filled halfway. Charged more than comparable full price elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I've had the brunch twice - same thing both times. Inconsistent. The first time was 4 stars. Second time was 2.5 stars. 

Chicken and Cornbread Waffle: 
The good: the secret to this item is the waffle. Nicely sweet with little corn bits that you can feel and taste. I would still chance this meal again just to eat the waffle, alone. The gravy (on the side) is flavorful, but heavy. 

Bloody Mary: the Milwaukeean - very nice. Hits the spot on heat (medium), thickness, mix flavor, garnishes (bacon! curd! pickle! carrot! olive!) and Lakefront shooter.

The bad: alas, the chicken is chicken strips. Well, call me a 4 year old and serve me strips. The first time the strips (3) were rather large, warm, and tender. The second time, the strips were small, dry, and cold. It was so bad, I showed the waitress and asked for another one. It was worse than the first 3! 

The ugly: they cannot poach an egg, and definitely not time it to the table. Knowing how to cook an egg is a basic. Mine were cold and overcooked. My dining companion had one warm and runny and the other was warm, medium.

Waitstaff: more on the lazy side. We never got our coffee, nor water re-filled. Never came back to ask how the food was - we had to flag her down about the dry strips. 

I think they rely on their sauces to cover their flaws, but the kitchen manager should really be more a part of the process. Those dry chicken strips should never have left the kitchen, not even a kid would eat that. Also a manager would have noticed the improper timing in the kitchen: the two plates of eggs - one cold and the other warm."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The ambience, the drinks and all the great dishes.  Gluten free dishes that aren't boring!  Salads that are tasty.  Check it out."}
{"text":"At this point... I'm a lot calmer than I was an hour ago. But I checked into this place a couple of hours ago. I was in the area and my kids and husband met with me to have lunch because I work nights this weekend and won't see/spend time with the kids until Tuesday. Anyway, we got here at 15-20 mins to 1300, Was seated at approximately 1315. We were fine with waiting for our seats and stayed optimistic. We put in our orders and waited. Like normal. It wasn't overwhelmingly busy during this time. So we waited and waited. Almost an hour later, while watching everyone else around us getting their food, eating than leaving. We started getting a but irritated. Our kids were so hungry they started crying, I was so hungry I just kind of sat quietly stewing, and my husband was trying to get someone's attention to help us get our meal. The waitress came to us once and dryly said she's sorry about the wait and the kitchen is backed up. After we finally had enough of waiting, we were going to just get up and leave my husband got the general manager's attention and expressed that he just watched 5 tables sit after us and got their food before us. Mind you, we only ordered a beet and arugula salad with salmon, sconnie burger, 3 kids meals (grilled chicken tenders and 2 mac and cheeses). As soon as my husband spoke with the general manager, the food finally came. As we were standing and ready to walk out. The general manager apologized and offered a discount off our bill. So we get our hour long meals and... you guessed it! It was COLD. EVERYTHING was cold: my salmon was cold, my husbands burger was cold, the frites were cold, the tenders and mac and cheese were cold and my kids fruit salad had dust on it. Wow.... the waitress just handed, literally handed our food to us. Not setting it down, Handed each plate to the kids and my husband... then after a while, came up and dryly asked how our food was and dryly apologized again. She asked if we needed anything and my stepson asked for ketchup multiple times and was ignored. I was already irritated and that just made me even more angry so I had to yell, \"Ma'am!\" She turned around and I said \"my son has been asking you for ketchup, may he have some please?\" Well, I had to work at 1500 and it was already 1400. The football game is happening and I have to work at 1500. I took a few bites of my salad and had to pack up and leave. So, my lunch with my family was a fail and we couldn't even enjoy our meal. The one star is for the fact that the general manager felt bad and gave us a discount. I had a total of 20 minutes attempting to enjoy my food before rushing downtown for work. I read the reviews heard about the good food but I didn't even get to enjoy it. My dining experience was ruined before I even got my meal so the food ended up not tasting the best. I couldn't enjoy my food and I had plenty of time to enjoy it. So from 1245 or 1250 to 1420 these people had that long impress me. Instead, my Saturday lunch date with my family was ruined. I'm never coming back. Sorry. But this place is not for me. Generally, I'm a very patient person but like everyone else, I have my limits. This experience really tested me."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be amazing. I've been to cafe Hollander 4 times; each time was with different size parties ranging between 2 to 8. 
I'm giving Cafe Hollander 3 stars because the beer and the building are the only reasons I come back. The food and service has been inconsistent each time I go. I've been there for brunch and had good service and food, while 3 months later, slow service while it wasn't busy, served cold frites, and over cooked burgers. 
I want this place to be better, because the beer and atmosphere of the restaurant is really good. The food needs to get on par."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp app to get a place in line and when we showed, sat immediately. 

First impressions of the decor and vibe was positive. 

While here for a Saturday lunch, it seemed our waiter was more overwhelmed than the others, hence a ding for the score. 

Food was very good - my date had the Nutella and Bananas waffle while I had the Sconnie burger with their own breakfast fries (which were a combination of several types of potatoes, including sweet). 

Together several reminders to get my beer (wide ranging varieties, but not many choices within the categories) as well as refill for ice tea. Tea was fresh and the Grimberger beer was a first for me - tasty and enjoyable. 

Crowd was young - but their were families - so it is a good restaurant for all ages and a popular spot, not too far from the UW campus.   I think you will like this place too."}
{"text":"This place is always... a scam, dude! The service is always nice and the restaurant itself looks great. But the food is so subpar, especially for the ridiculous prices. This time I got the Seafood Sauté. The seafood was over cooked overall. Presentation was just shabby, a lump of rice the middle of the \"sauté\" (could I even call it that?). The taste left something to be desired but I ate most of it because I paid twenty bucks for it. 

I've been the the Cafe Hollander in Mequon, Brookfield, and Madison. I think their brunch is their best bet. Not so much the dinner items."}
{"text":"I have been to the Milwaukee location and we decided to come here for my friends birthday. First off, it's HUGE! Two floors and  like 3 different rooms on the first floor with plenty of outdoor seating. They took a while to seat us though we had made a reservation we did have a pretty big group (12 people). The food is around $14 for a meal. More than I'm usually willing to spend. My friend and I split a plate (neither of us were too hungry) and it was enough to fill us up! 
It has a really fun atmosphere and is very well known in the area, but in my humble opinion it's a little expensive for all the hype."}
{"text":"I think a lot of people would agree that the largesse, open atmosphere of Cafe Hollander brings a fresh perspective to the Madison restaurant scene. This place quickly piggy backed off the popularity of the Milwaukee locations, raising it to a high status from the get go. I first went here in the summer, when it boasts garage door windows and an open breeze. Definitely my preferred season to visit. If you going to brunch here, try to sit away in the tucked away section on the first floor with high, sunny ceilings and lotsa plants. 

Apart from the killer layout and design, the Milwaukee bloody is what brings back. Perfect amount of spice with a touch of crispy bacon to finish it off. This most recent visit I ordered the smoky burger. My mistake getting it cooked medium, way way too pink. The taste was bomb. Smoked Gouda, bacon, and avocado makes this burger borderline gluttony. Indulge yourself at Cafe Hollander. I'm confident they'll have something you're looking for."}
{"text":"I think I just had the best salad of my life, Blackened Shrimp and Pear!  The grilled flavor of the shrimp blended perfectly with the fruit and salad dressing.  I will definitely be going back. 
  Ambience in the beer den was so cozy, I was actually disappointed that our table was ready so soon after we checked in that we weren't able to sit and unwind a bit.  The beer den waitress was excellent!  She ran to the main bar to bring us preferred, mixed drinks and she followed us to our table and carried our drinks for us!
  For being busy we were able to get a table within ten minutes.  I did found the noise level to be irritating in the full and busy restaurant.  Since we were there around 7pm, it started to clear out and the noise level became tolerable.  All the windows are great and there is a nice patio, too bad the view is Target and a parking lot though.
  I will definitely return b/c of the food and the beer den may be a new routine hangout!"}
{"text":"The Cafe Hollander has tasty food all right, and the atmosphere is bright and clean even if a bit cluttered. 

But management needs to get a handle on its rude, too-hip-for-you waitstaff. One very tall, heavily-bearded, fair-haired food-server, in particular, couldn't have been less professional in his attitude. 

Meanwhile, service was slow, with drinks left un-refilled. Our waitperson, a pleasant-enough woman, seemed overworked -- while three employees at the front desk twiddled their thumbs. Not an acting manager in sight. All this during a relatively slow hour. 

It's a mystery why a restaurant with so much going for it would let a clueless, rude staff undermine everyone else's hard work.

We'll give Cafe Hollander another try, but unless its waitstaff gets a serious attitude adjustment, and its managers take their job more seriously, it will be our last visit."}
{"text":"Husband chose this place for date night this month.  We got there around 5:20 and were seated immediately.  I'm glad we went early because it was full from about 6:30 until we left around 7 and it was a Wednesday night!  The hostess was super friendly as was the waitress.
I ordered the pomegranate mule to start.  Really enjoyed it and enjoyed the fact that while it was served in the proper copper mug, the handle was not copper so it wasn't awful and cold to pick up and drink.  Husband tried two new beers which he liked, but the prices of the beers totaled $15, so if you're looking for cheap beer, go to your local dive instead.
We both ordered the Sconnie burger--fried pickles, bacon, aged cheddar all skewered with cheese curds on a pretzel bun and served with frites. OH MY GOSH. I loved this burger.  I got it with a side of ranch (I'm Midwestern through and through, what can I say?).  The burger did not need the ranch, but definitely added to it.  It was cooked the way I wanted it as well.  The only issues was that the pretzel bun got soggy and thin and didn't cover the full beef patty so it got hard to eat.  The frites were seasoned, some more than others, but I thoroughly enjoyed the seasoning, reminded me of seasoning salt. 
We split the hot fudge brownie skillet for dessert.  Definitely good to share, but you might be fighting for the last bite.  If you don't like the taste of coffee, don't let the coffee cream scare you off, it did not have a strong coffee flavor.
We're planning on returning in the future.  I want to try the breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Very impressed - venue was great (I liked the one in Milwaukee but this is really well done), and food/beer was on point.  I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"We are familiar with Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee, which is a very solid nice place to have a drink, lunch or coffee. The management in Madison must be trying to convert this location from a Cafe to a high volume sports bar. The noise level throughout the restaurant was unbelievable! We had a group of friends who wanted to have a conversation and it was impossible. Even with repeated attempts to have the music and TV sports volume lowered, it was impossible to hold a conversation. We had no choice but to leave. I will not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm not a big beer drinker, but if you love beer this is the place to visit. They have an incredible large selection. 
I really love their Belgian table bread. It's a very soft pull-apart bread that is covered on parmesan cheese and served with a side of chive butter. Una delicia mua!! 
Also I'm a big fan of the truffle chive hanger steak. I always replace the gratin potatoes for Brussels because I don't like the potatoes. I also don't like their the mashed potatoes because it's very intense. It has cheese, other people might like it. I'm just not crazy about it. 
This is the first place that I don't have problems ordering what I want bc I know exactly what I like.
Their risotto is also good. However I didn't like the wild mushroom risotto bc it's really heavy on the mushrooms. I used to enjoy mushrooms, now I can't eat them anymore. 
Their Mac and cheese is noms!!
So their brunch menu is also really good. I love the brewcity benedict. So good!!! Specially the biscuits, but what I enjoyed the most was the blackberry turkey sandwich. It's pretty pretty good. 
But the main reason why I love this place is the bikes! I am a bicycle fan, so when I go there I feel like in a bike museum. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"very average menu, borderline pub style.
Had a toasted turkey Sandwich with cranberry and cheese. 
It was mediocre at best.
Very awkward seating. We sat in like a hallway space. The booth seating was the wall behind the entrance/hostess stand. There was a table of two squeezed in up against the wall to my left, and there was a table of two that sort of had to get up to let our party of four get into our 4 top. 
Very pleased with the obscure drink variety.
I got to try an on-tap alcoholic kombucha, which has been something I wan't to try for a while.
And the waitress got the bartender to make a \"fancy\" drink for our pregnant friend, that looked pretty while all of us had alcohol. Kudos on that one. 
Not what I expected, and probably will only go back to use my mad-city tin."}
{"text":"It was okay. Pluses include the wonderful indoor/outdoor space and formidable beer list. Our server was friendly, helpful, and efficient. Now for the gripes... I got a scanty beer pour with a lot of foam. In a nice pilsner glass, though. But really not what you expect at the premium prices. My fourteen-dollar hamburger was a bit of a disappointment, too. Big, but not really special in any way. Kudos to the crispy sweet potato frites. Beer, burgers, and fries; it doesn't get more basic than that. You'll easily find better."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant to come here with the mixed reviews, but it was fantastic!  We came for breakfast, and made sure to get there just a little before 9:00 as we wanted to beat the churchies. 

It was pretty empty when we got there, and kinda busy by the time we left. Service was friendly and attentive. 

I had the chorizo breakfast burrito with a similarly themed Bloody Mary. Both were very tasty and just spicy enough. My wife had the Brew City Benedict with a biermosa. 

We can't wait until the weather gets warmer to try the outdoor seating and try more beers. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here on cold snowy morning, and I fell in love with the atmosphere. It is beyond cozy. Lots of wood finishes and very modern log cabin. I wish I could kick it there regularly. I won't lie, I did peruse the menu before coming here and the beignets caught my eye right away and Oh MY GOD you guys, you HAVE to get them. They are little fried dough pillows in your mouth! And they come with a chocolate and lemon cream dipping sauces. The chocolate sauce is delicious and kind of the obvious choice in my head, BUT do NOT neglect the lemon cream sauce. It's creamy and not overly sweet. It's a surprisingly great combo (I usually go for the decadent sweets, not the fruity ones) I ordered the Breakfast BELT-A sammy (bacon,egg,lettuce,tomato & avocado) with a flavorful basil aioli and It was so delicious and big, I had half a sandwich to take home for the next day which I loved. I believe my sandwich came with some breakfast potatoes, which were kinda just alright. But overall I definitely want to come back and explore more of the menu and get lost in some more beignets."}
{"text":"I really like the look and atmosphere of Cafe Hollander especially it's airi openness in the Summer. I had the meat loaf for lunch with one of there six bloody Mary options. Lots of nearby parking. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very fun environment; calamari appetizer was cold and must have been sitting for awhile. Cream of mushroom soup was cold as well, not hot. Another disappointment. Curry cashew chicken was soupy and flavorless. The braised beef rib poutine was great, as was the chicken chopped salad. We subbed salmon for the chicken in the salad which was a delicious choice. Portions were perfectly sized and the presentation was clean. Loud atmosphere but we were lucky with a corner table, endless beer menu with options from across the globe. We'd go back but will definitely not be ordering certain items again."}
{"text":"Would i come here again? Yes. I had a salad with chicken last weekend and it was $13. I would say it was very average for that price. It was good, it hit the spot but i think that was a tad to expensive. The ambiance of the restaurant is great, one of the better places to eat in the hilldale mall area."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, good service, and they always have a variety of healthy selections.  Our kids love the kids meals and the online waitlist makes us keep coming back.  Their are long lines that form for brunch so the online waitlist is a must with kids."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander and I have a love-hate relationship. Having been to the Milwaukee location before there was one in Madison, I was so excited to see it open at Hilldale!  Yet if there's one thing that's consistent at Cafe Hollander, that is its inconsistency. You can order the [great] tomato bisque, and sometimes it will arrive lukewarm, sometimes scalding hot. Today it arrived as if by boat on the Bering Sea; the rim was splattered and the soup had soaked the paper napkin that the bowl had been set on. The bread we ordered was so buttery you could write your name on the top of each bun. It came long, long after the soup was finished, because who could have imagined one might actually like to eat bread with the soup?  The Benelux salad was so drenched in dressing one could hardly taste anything else, and the skin of the cherry tomatoes was shriveled as if the chef was telling me \"here, YOU throw these away.\" (In the past this salad has arrived dry, with barely any dressing, and crispy fresh cherry tomatoes: Again, inconsistent!)  Of all the times I've been to Hollander only once has anyone refilled my coffee without me having to ask (I remember it well exactly because it caught me by surprise that someone bothered to check without being prompted!)  Sometimes you could read a book before the check comes; this time it came very promptly. Today was extra special because upon being seated, the table top had crumbs on it. I asked the hostess to wipe it down and she wouldn't do it; she said that was just paint peeling from the tabletop (as if that makes it ok). Never before have I asked someone to wipe a dirty tabletop and been denied!  But it's not her fault. Nor the servers' fault. Nor the kitchen's fault. It's the management's fault. Obviously Hollander staff receive lousy training and hardly any supervision--but it's someone's job to make sure that doesn't happen. That someone is out to lunch, and until then going to Cafe Hollander will be an experience one tolerates rather than enjoys.

Addendum: As an aside, Hollander's customer survey URL printed on the receipt leads to a dead site. If you're persistent and google the company, then go to the feedback page, the \"comments\" section limits how much you can write. And if you do write something, don't hold your breath for a reply.  Lousy."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Hollander several times, and each time I enjoy it even more than the last. From the service, to the food, to the beer selection, it has yet to give me anything to complain about (and I don't think it ever will).

The last time I was there we were seated upstairs, and our server was Graham. He was honestly one of the best servers I have had not just at Cafe Hollander but in general. He was attentive, funny, made excellent suggestions, and seemed to genuinely care about our experience at Cafe Hollander. Thank you so much Graham! 

The food quality has never wavered in the multiple times I have been there. Their cheese curds are fantastic, and they have a delicious fish fry on Fridays as well. They have a wonderful brunch menu too. 

My favorite part of Cafe Hollander (and I'm sure many other people's favorite as well) has to be their beer menu. I can always count on finding something unique on the menu that I haven't tried yet, and I love how they have a recommended beer to go with their menu items. It's a great place to get a good bloody mary too, as they have a few different varieties on their drink menu.

Cafe Hollander has been our go-to place for large groups of friends and family, because we can always count on everyone finding something on the menu that they like. They also have a lot of seating space and very rarely do we have to deal with a wait, even on the weekends. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love cafe Hollander! Their beer, cocktail, and coffee menu is extensive and their brunch and lunch food is amazing. Paige was our waitress and she was so attentive and fast, it made for a great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went the the Madison location.  The beer selection is outstanding, but could afford to provide more local Madison options.  The bruschetta was delicious.  It came with the goat cheese topped-crostini encircling a well-seasoned salad of grape tomatoes marinated in Italian spices.  It was all drizzled with a delicious balsamic vinegar.  The dish was presented beautifully, but the tomatoes were prepared in advance and intentionally served cold.  I would have preferred the entire dish to be warm.   Overall, a great dish, but the $12 price tag is something to consider.
Main courses - I had the Cafe burger with regular fries, she the Smokey Burger with sweet potato fries.  While both were cooked to a perfect medium-well and had excellent flavor, the slab of white cheddar on my burger was not melted at all.  It was literally a chunk of cheese on top of a burger.  Dare I say I would have been content with 1 slab of cheese that was melted?  The wife's sweet potato fries came out cold and soggy, as if they'd been sitting for awhile.  She mentioned this to the waitress, who was more than happy to comp a cone of fresh fries and 2 dipping sauces - almost seemed as this was something that had happened before.  When the new order of fries were brought, they were great.  
While the food was fine, it must be noted that the server, Rachel (I think), was fantastic.  She was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout the meal - truly a great server."}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion. I have sat in the bar area three times and the service has been mediocre at best. The beer list is good if you like Belgians. The food is better than most chain restaurants, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander is one of my go-to places. I am typically pleased with my meals, particularly with brunch menu items - shout out to the Eggs Benedict and the Hot Mess Skillet! Cafe Hollander in the summertime is divine - the outdoor seating on the main level patio, the 2nd floor patio, and the seating inside the place along the window-walls are all excellent spots to enjoy the weather with some tasty beverages in-hand. Speaking of beverages - I like the Hollander Old Fashioned (made with Korbel brandy and walnut bitters) and the Cucumber Blueberry Mule (served in a copper mug, as the traditional Mule is). The beer list is extensive, to say the least. The food is a little over-priced, in my opinion, but the atmosphere of Cafe Hollander is what keeps me coming back - Always lively and fun."}
{"text":"What a shame, the space is so cool but the food and service just don't match. 

Stopped by on a Friday night for dinner and to our surprise were seated right away. They have a great selection of beer but that's about the only thing I would every return for. Our server did nothing but take our order and appear super rushed. Someone else brought out all of our food (which all came out at different times). It felt super weird tipping our waiter because he didn't really do much.

The food was not good. Everything was warm at best and didn't taste very fresh. The cheese curds were not good at all. Too think of breading and super greasy. I had the mac and cheese which was nothing special. Not horrible, not great. It could use a lot more cheese sauce. I heard similar things from the rest of the table that ordered sandwiches and burgers. Everything was cool/warm and just meh. 

I don't think I'll return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gorgeous location, great food, decent service"}
{"text":"I have been to this Cafe Hollander several times. The food is always amazing, however, the service is unreliable. 

I have tried several of their menu items, their breakfast all day have some of my favorites. Their Quiche Loraine - Ish and Quinoa Skillet are two I keep going back to. 

The restaurant is large with multiple seating areas. There are large windows that open upstairs with an outdoor seating area. 

Service has always been mediocre. However, the service today was terrible. We waited over 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. Two other tables near us were also waiting and ended up leaving."}
{"text":"After reading some of the yelp reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. But I had a great experience at Cafe Hollander, and as long as you go in knowing it's a Belgian Brewery type of place, you won't be disappointed. First, the building is impressively large, the decor is intriguing, and the upstairs has TVs a plenty for game viewing. The beer list is extensive, and the food menu, which has a decent variety for a Belgian brewery, proved to give us all a good, solid meal (4 different entrees ordered). I had the salmon, which despite a lackluster presentation (but again, Belgian brewery!), was very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Sconnie Burger! Atmosphere is great as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander has a perfect vibe. airy, bright, updated, etc. their service is continually very good, I just find their food isn't really on par
with the rest of the restaurant. like don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but like it definitely looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"My review is only for brunch so I really hope dinner here is a lot better. I gave this place three tries thinking maybe the first time (and second) were a fluke. This was recommending by some friends and I thought it would be a lot better. The food that I've gotten for brunch has been bland and lackluster. The last time I went was over 4th of July, I had the Chorizo Breakfast Mac 'n Cheese and it was nothing special and not really cheesy. In fact, I was asking myself where the Chorizo was.... 
The only reason I gave Cafe Hollander two stars and not one was because it has a great beer selection and their cheese curds were pretty great. If they could incorporate the dipping sauce into more place that they use for the cheese curds, they might convince me to give them another try. Very cool atmosphere but I'd only go back for a beer and skip the food."}
{"text":"I checked it out during the soft launch. The atmosphere is beautiful. The service was great. There were a few minor mistakes due to it being so new (one friend got the wrong burger and another ordered a beer from the menu which was apparently not in stock), but the servers handled it great. The food was very meh and over-priced. I had a quinoa skillet which was served with tomato sauce so overpowering you couldn't taste anything else. The beer menu was huge and wonderful but very hard to read. The beers were also a bit expensive. I kind of understand the markup due to them being imported and more specialized, but I feel Brasserie V has a similarly cool beer menu for a better price and much better and reasonably priced food. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"All in all it's neat place with a cool bar and good food and drinks. Have been a few times (brunch and late lunch.) This last time we came around 330 on a Saturday (not busy) and had our little guy who was asleep in the stroller. Knowing we wouldn't be able to get him out, we asked to be seated in a back corner out of the way. I recognize sometimes guests can't be accommodated but when the place is relatively empty and there's a sleeping baby..I expected a little more flexibility. 

Instead we received a lecture from the host on why we couldn't be seated in the corner & were asked 3 times to take him out and use a highchair. She even stood and waited by where she wanted us to park the stroller and we overheard her telling our server that we insisted on keeping the baby in the stroller. 
It was a bit much and unnecessary (we checked with our server if it was ok and she said of course.) He woke up eventually and I moved the stroller. Honestly if we weren't so hungry we would have left.

A few stars for the food/drinks but their host that day definitely did not make it easy for us. Hopefully they have lightened up as most families with babies at a mall will have a stroller in tow."}
{"text":"Okay, I tried Cafe Hollander after their soft opening, once for breakfast during the week and today for brunch. I am eager to try them for lunch and dinner. Breakfast during the week went perfectly, Sunday brunch, not so much (for me.)

The breakfast menu is eclectic and fun. If you don't feel like a lot of food, you can always order the toast with assorted toppings, such as Roasted Apple or Nuttella/Peanut Butter. I had the quiche with the salad, which was just enough food for mid-morning. The drip coffee is Collectivo and the server comes around several times to top up your coffee. Every menu item comes with a beer pairing (yes, even breakfast) and there is there tremendous Bloody Mary menu to pick and choose from. One of my fellow reviewers mentioned how the beer menu is overwhelming. I noticed that if you concentrate on the tap beers, signified by dot and the Belgium beers that are specially made for Cafe Hollander, also signified by a dot after the name, you have parred your decisions down to a manageable level. You can request a free taste sample of the tap beers to decide which one you like. Best of all, it is blessedly, blessedly quiet and you can linger with one the newspapers in the holder across from the hostess station. I'm scared that it will not be long before the dreaded Mommy brigade finds out about for breakfast.

So, the Sunday brunch. I would suggest you become acquainted with the Metro 2 bus schedule that stops at Hilldale, because if you have someone in your party who has mobility issues, they are going to have traverse a good portion of the parking lot, even in late afternoon. Even around 2 pm, they were packed and taking reservations with a 25 minute or more wait. Cafe Hollander asks for your name and phone number for the wait for a table & then texts you when a table opens up. I was lucky it was a nice day out today, so I could wait outside. The table I was lead to was in the atrium section (with the tree in the middle and the plant boxes near the ceiling). The tables are close together in that section and every kid, whether they were mobile or carried in arms, had to kick my table to get by. It didn't help that an oblivious family had planted a huge, open diaper bag right in the path of where every server had to get by. (One of the exit doors was blocked by an enormous battering ram stroller, because of course it was). I didn't feel like breakfast food at that time of day, so I ordered the burger, which didn't list lettuce or tomato on the menu and wasn't offered when I ordered the burger. Yes, I could have ordered when the server came back, but given that I wasn't given a napkin or silverware when my food came, I wasn't going to press my luck with getting tomato/lettuce. Understandably, they were busy and a lot of things were going on around me. It wasn't for me, but if you are the kind of person or party that is not put off by large, messy families or a lot of noise, this is the place for you on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Lunch event on Friday afternoon, my first time here. After reading some of the comments on photos, I wasn't looking forward to any of the food. 

I ordered an expensive (for what it was) dish, the chicken whipped tater tots skillet. It had ample (but cold and chewy, overdone) chicken with vegetables, some barely cooked and some sautéed, in a cream sauce with blobs of whipped potatoes on top. 

I ate some of it because I was hungry, but it was definitely a less than stellar dish. It was the first time I ever asked for a box for the leftovers, but then decided to just leave it on the table. And I looove food, so that tells you how much I really didn't like it. 

Server was attentive; we had a large group but I think that's why my dish was cold, I bet mine was made first. The skillet it was served in was cold, too. 

If you want to network and hear the people you're talking to clearly, do NOT go to this place for lunch or dinner or brunch or... just don't go. I had to read lips 50% of the time, it was so loud. 

I'll likely never dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a week night, it was busy, but not super crowded. Was able to get seated right away. The beer selection was very extensive. Had a lot of beers I had not heard of. The food all looked pretty good on paper. In execution however, the theme across the board is \"two more minutes\"! Everything we ordered (aside from dessert) could have used about 2 more minutes of cooking time. The red pepper hummus was a bit watery, and the pita bread was a bit doughy still. The flavors were a bit thin, had they cooked it for 'two more minutes', it would have helped the flavors come together. I ordered the jambalaya, the portion size was pretty good. The flavors were ok, maybe a bit over salted. The rice in the jamabalaya could have used 'two more minutes' of cooking time. It was definitely past el dente into the flat out undercooked territory. My friend got the chicken BLT wrap with sweet potato fries. The fries could have used 'two more minutes', because they were still just a bit too soggy. The bacon in the wrap was the same story. The brownie skillet was pretty great though. Definitely not a one person serving, so definitely plan on sharing that unless you really want to give your pancreas a really good workout. Might give this place another go at some point. Hopefully by then, the kitchen will give all the food Two More Minutes of cooking time!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with our experience here. I LOVE the Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee, but this place was just not the same. Our food was super salty and nothing special, and the cocktail I got (I'm not a beer person) was not good at all. Unfortunately, we won't be back to the Madison location."}
{"text":"Drinks are great, beer selection is very good, and the appetizers/snacks are pretty good. Food quality should be better."}
{"text":"This is a typical brew pug type setting with a \"European cycling\" theme. The setting was casual and the service was good for a Saturday night.

My wife ordered the Chicken Tator Tot Skillet and I ordered the Benelux Meatloaf. The tator-tot skilled was average. I think we were expecting something else. The homemade tator-tots used were large balls of potatoes that kinda of resembled a donut hole. The sauce was flavorful and tasty. The meatloaf was very delicious. It was tender and the gravy was very tasty!

We had the root beer float for dessert and this was also very good. They have an \"adult\" version made with Not Your Father's Root Beer and a kid-friendly one. I really like how they added malted milk balls as a twist on the traditional float.

Overall, I would visit this place again. It had a nice brew pub, casual feel and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The food was amazing, the staff is incredibly sweet, and it is so gorgeous inside! Came here during peak brunch time with 11 people...ELEVEN PEOPLE...and they were extremely kind and accommodating. 

Everyone ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito, French toast, pancakes, whatever...too many people to remember their orders. But, we shared the cheese curds (duh, we're in Wisconsin), the people nearest to me ordered the egg white omelet and cleaned their plates, and I ordered the Brewcity Benedict. I usually don't like eggs benedict OR breakfast potatoes, but the hollandaise and biscuit were seasoned perfectly and the potatoes were crispy and colorful!!

Would 100% return, but I don't live here sadly"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Between the food, drinks and atmosphere, you can't go wrong. I highly recommend their fried cheese curds and burgers!"}
{"text":"We were in Hilldale Wednesday night. We drove past Cafe Hollander and decided to give it a try.

Pros:

It's not often that I rave about the building and atmosphere but I really like the Cafe Hollander building. Lots of wood, glass, and metal. We sat in an atrium like room where a tree was growing and it appeared one of the glass walls could be opened. Bike themed memorabilia galore. Appeared there was seating on the roof as well as a second story overlooking the main room. Large bar area. It was modern, but comfortable, and very pleasing to the eye. Felt like a really great spot to hang out alone or with friends.

I was also impressed with the drink menu. A variety of Bloody Marys, cocktails, coffee drinks, etc. We tried a couple of the Bloody Mary varieties. Mine was spicy with avocado, asparagus and cucumber. Very tasty.

The beer menu was impressive. It emphasized Belgium beers, but also included an excellent selection of draughts and bottles. I could drink here for months and constantly try something new. Very nice.

I also enjoyed the uniqueness of the food menu. There were items you just don't find elsewhere such as the dutch bitterballen, and short rib poutine. The salads, sandwiches, burgers,and entrees all had twists to make them unique and not run of the mill. Whether it was a pretzel bun or gouda cheese, it was interesting. However, since we were in a Belgian restaurant I decided to go traditional and ordered a pound of classic mussels and frites. My partner ordered the tasty sounding grains and green salad.

Cons:
Service was not the best. Our waitress showed up immediately, before we'd even had a chance to glance at the menu. We asked if we could have a few minutes to look at the menu. When she returned we ordered drinks. Eventually she brought our drinks and we ordered food. Then we waited. And waited. I was hoping to ask her a question about what kind of chaser she had brought with the Bloody Mary but we didn't see her again until she brought the food. Our entrees did come but it was after that point where you're starting to wonder if something happened and if they will be bringing it or not.

I was happily overwhelmed by the amount of mussels. My partner commented the there must be more than one pound but we decided perhaps they get new mussels the next day and they were getting rid of the surplus. (Note: wrong -- see later in review.) The grains and green salad was tasty w/arugula, rice, quinoa, cashews, carrots, cranberries and mint. However the portion size was small. Luckily we had frites also. Oh wait, the frites had not come. We would have flagged down our waitress but she was nowhere to be seen. About ten minutes later she showed up w/the fries so she or the cook must have realized we had not gotten them. The frites had good texture but again European portion-size. The broth on the mussels when I got down to it was also tasty and it came with bread and a spoon so I was able to slurp it all up.

When our waitress brought the bill, we realized why there had been so many mussels. She had put it down as two pounds instead of one. My partner agreed that I had only ordered one. However I did eat them all, so we didn't bring it up.

Conclusion: I'd definitely go back. I loved the space and want to try more of their beverages and dishes. I do hope they improve their service. It was pretty slow and they did not appear that busy. Our waitress was nice but just didn't seem particularly competent."}
{"text":"It was New Year's Eve brunch. We started with beignets. They were fluffy and delicious. My blubbery pancakes with the special blueberry butter was amazing. Rest of my company tired Americano, bourbon waffle and the white egg Mediterranean omelet. We all loved it. The service was great as well. Will sure make it here again!!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best breakfasts I've had in Madison, made the right decision by going at 9 am and not getting caught up in the Sunday brunch crowd. Not too pricey in comparison either, only about $30 for two full breakfasts. Very nice atmosphere and friendly service, our waitress was very attentive and the manager was making rounds and checking in with each of the tables also. Extremely impressed overall!"}
{"text":"We've been to Cafe Hollander several times and LOVE the food. The cinnamon streusel French toast with the orange marmalade is to die for (along with the Hollander potatoes)!  My only complaint is that the service is lack luster. I'm not sure if they have staffing issues but every time we go, we get sub par service which is disappointing because the food is wonderful. If they can get the service perfected, this place would get 5 stars. Kudos to the chef though!"}
{"text":"I came here today, a Friday evening and it seemed busy but we were seated immediately and received quick service. My food was great!"}
{"text":"Café Hollander is a great place to go for brunch or lunch. It definitely requires a little bit of time, as sometimes they have a wait and it is a sit-down style restaurant. Also, post meal (if you are like me) you are probably super, super full and need a little time to recuperate. 

Ambiance: 
Café Hollander has a lot to look at. The restaurant very large with both upstairs, downstair, indoor and outdoor seating. They are decorated with brick style walls, large leather booths, and bike decor. The restaurant has large garage door windows that open in the summer time. Overall, a really trendy space that offers background noise but still allows you to have conversations with those around you. 

Food: 
Overall, amazing. It came quick and was extremely filling. Definitely over-ate, but each bit was totally worth it. 
The Frenchie Bloody Mary - Absolute must have for brunch. Not too spicy with a pickle, carrot, haricot vert, and blue cheese stuffed olive. The perfect way to start any morning. 
House-Made Cheese Curds: The perfect pair to any bloody mary. With their thick breading with white cheddar cheese, these cheese curds are a perfect start to your meal. But Café Hollander's Sriracha ranch dipping sauce is really what makes this appetizer with its spicy, creamy flavor. 
Nutella Auth Liège Entic Waffle: SO GOOD. If you are going for a sweet breakfast, this is absolutely perfect. The waffle is topped with warm Nutella, toasted marshmallows and a cherry. 
BrewCity Benedict: One of their multiple eggs benedict choices and a good one. The cooked to perfection breakfast sausage patty is a delicious salty start to your morning. The poached eggs are, of course, topped with hollandaise sauce making it a great choice if something more savory is on your mind. 

Service: 
The service was quick and very accommodating. Our waitress was always present asking if we needed anything. The restaurant was very welcoming and flexible, even when half of our party showed up late. We never felt rushed to finish but encouraged to order more drinks or try different things."}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch. very cool environment. I love the egg sandwich. Next time I come to Hilldale I will be stopping here for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and family 3 weeks after it opened. We were a little nervous going to a place so new, but decided to try it out. 

When you first walk in, it's loud. REALLY loud. My voice was getting strained trying to carry on a conversation with the 3 people next to me at the bar. The wait was about 30 mins and he asked for someone's cell number and told us they would text us when our table was ready. Being in Hilldale, I like that idea, since then you can go off and shop if it's a long wait. I was nervous I might incur a barrage of spam texts from them, but it's been a week and I have not received one.

We were seated and to our dismay, the dining room was no quieter than the bar. Our waitress (Kristin) was phenomenal. She was attentive, friendly and patient. Everyone else ordered a burger, I ordered  crab and brie stuffed salmon and an order of cheese curds. The curds were pretzel breaded and were really good. The consensus on the burgers was they were good, nothing spectacular. Mine was very good other than the \"crab\". What the menu doesn't tell you is that it's basically a crab cake brick. It was weird and a little flavorless. It would be better with real crab, or remove the crab cake altogether and it would be delicious on its own.

I usually like to report the price of my meal, but someone else swiped up the check before I could look. However, when I was first looking over the menu, I remember thinking the prices were very reasonable and the portions were also ample. Not overkill, but not sparse.

They have garage type doors in the dining that I assume will be opened in the summer. 

I would definitely come back, but probably in the summer when we could enjoy the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Never again.  We live and work near Hollander and want to like it, we really do. Service AND food during all 5 visits has been aweful.

Tonight's visit (and our last) gave me a burnt \"medium\" burger,  missing the much touted smokey sauce. Server said he would bring it asap and never did. My husbands lobster risotto tasted like....nothing. Lobster risotto should have flavor I presume. After he ate the 2 teeny bites of lobster he was done.

Server was  nice, but slow and knew how to talk a good game. The minute he realized we were not going to order a $12 cocktail he promptly forgot we were there. 

I've had better meals at Noodles and Company."}
{"text":"Wow,
We are very impressed !! This place has Both my needs as well as Johns vegetarian and vegan options!! We have eaten two brunches both time very busy days but our experience was outstanding and food options very unique and fast service from both our server as well as our manager !! I would like to take my hat off to the kitchen for a super great job !!"}
{"text":"Before moving to Madison I had been to a couple of their Milwaukee area locations and had always been very pleased, so I was really excited to see one coming to town. The space is gorgeous and the location is excellent. In the summer their outdoor seating options are really nice. But, the service can be remarkably poor. Like it takes 20 minutes to place a drink order after being seated poor. If service is questionable a time or two it doesn't keep me from coming back. But, I'm starting to lose faith. Their beer menu is awesome and there are several menu items I really enjoy, but it's hard to justify the money and time spent there when the most reliable thing about the restaurant is becoming that I won't be happy with the service."}
{"text":"Their food is okay, nothing special.

If you like beer, they probably have decent beer. 

The worst thing is that it's so LOUD. 
People come in and complain about it and people who work there think it's strange but it is actually so loud because the second floor is open and built around so that the first and second floor aren't separated. Even if it's not crowded, it's difficult to have a conversation here without yelling."}
{"text":"I love the ability to add my name to the waiting list from the Yelp app.  We did this on Father's day and waited 5min once we arrived.  The food was delicious.  They even accommodated my son's request to get the smore waffle as a kids meal.  Overall, a wonderful brunch experience."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison. They have an amazing selection of bier. You can tell that they have a scratch kitchen, because the food tastes like homemade. Many of their dishes are very different from what you can find in other restaurants around Madison."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast.  I love the open-air dining.  There are a lot of breakfast/brunch options.  The beignets are quite good.  My only disappointment was that they describe thick cut bacon in their menu when in actuality it is regular bacon.  Also, the bacon was under-cooked and I couldn't even eat it!"}
{"text":"I see many reviews that mention slow service and long waits. Couldn't agree more after meeting friends for a birthday celebration this afternoon. Someone's not training the waitstaff very well - and they could sure use it. Also a little training in table side pleasantries and general courtesy would be advisable. The food was good - nothing to write home about- but decent. $8 for mimosa just b/c it has 2 blueberries and some fancy vodka? Won't make that mistake again. But it was all pleasant enough, until we were ready to go and had to wait and wait and wait for our checks. And wait. And wait. I have no idea what the problem was, but I came very close to walking out without paying, and I'm NOT that person. 30 minutes, standing around to pay the bill-ridiculous! It's not as if they were overwhelmed with customers, either. We were upstairs and were one of 2 large tables along with several 2 and 4 tops, and there seemed to be no shortage of staff. Get it together, Cafe Hollander Hilldale -you've got everything else going for you in that location. No excuse for slow, sub-par service."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander has a great atmosphere and dinner has been awesome the few times we have been there.  But this morning's brunch was a sore disappointment.  I understand the long wait, as we had a large party.  But at 12 noon, they were already out of several items.  We were told they were out of the tenderloin skillet, when in reality, they finally told us it was the hash browns they were out of.  Seriously, 12 noon brunch and out of hash browns???  They then offered to sub in the Potoates Hollander, which actually were quite nice...an American fry with a nice crisp exterior.  The unfortunate part of the tenderloin skillet was that there were only about a half dozen nickel to quarter size pieces of meat, resembling sirloin tips more than tenderloin.  The Hollandaise that was to top it all was 1) virtually non existent 2) very bland.

If you are topping as many of the brunch items with the sauce... please learn to make a proper one....and give me enough to cover all my food...not one bite. Even the eggs Benedict had at most 1 Tablespoon of Hollandaise on the extremely over poached eggs ( after specifically ordering them poached lightly).  We pointed out that the eggs were extremely over done, and while they did bring new ones, they slapped them in a small bowl and brought them to the table to eat with the now cold potatoes.  When more Hollandaise was requested, more than half the table had finished eating by the time the sauce made it to the table.

For a $12-14 brunch plate, I expect to have a nice mound of potatoes, with my bennies poached to perfection and slathered in textbook Hollandaise, with enough to smear my taters in.  One should love the sauce enough that you search for a way to savor that last drop...not look for the last drop."}
{"text":"It's a Belgian place crossed with The Great Dane or TGI Fridays.  Had brunch.  The drink list is great.  But the food was C level mall restaurant slop.  Frites were just generic pale fries.  Aioli was just some ranch dressing.  Everything was bland while still being unnecessarily rich.  A chain restaurant.

Good spot for a drink.  But you can do so much better for food nearby (murimoto, dumpling house) and better for Belgian (brasseri v, sardine if you are desperate) in Madison."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and location. I sat at the bar with my friend for dinner/drinks and we were promptly greeted with a smile and menus. They have an extensive beer menu so it can be a little hard to choose what exactly you would want to order, but they do give samples which is great! So try try try before you decide which beer you want to order. I'll be back again for another beer and to chill with some friends. My friend ordered the cheese board and it looked really good. Especially their crostinis. YUM!

Happy drinking and eating :)"}
{"text":"This place looks so cool inside and out and they have a great drink menu but unfortunately the food menu is a let down. Not many choices, mostly just white space on the menu and the food descriptions may sound good but they never seem to match up with what they actually bring you."}
{"text":"My husband just loves it. The chicken waffle is the best. And I like to have a rest here in the morning."}
{"text":"The service remains the same. 

The waitress(Tierney) wasn't customer oriented...at least not at my table. The table directly across from us and behind us got all of the service...We asked 3 times for straws, she didn't bring 1 straw. We had to flag down a young man, who got us all straws in less than 120 seconds. We asked Tierney to clear the table for our appetizers...didn't get done. She gave my drink to my friend and when he realized it after drinking out of it, and stating he had done so, Tierney asked if I wanted that one or fresh cup...........What in the world!

The food was just ok, when it finally arrived. We waited over 20 minutes for food after we finished appetizers. It was nothing delightful, I tried something new, a burger with bacon and avocado. It at least was cooked medium as I had requested, but the rest of the food experience was lacking.

No change in rating."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for dinner. Some friends suggested this place for a double date on a Friday night. We were told it was about a 1.5 hour wait, but I'm pretty sure we sat down quicker. The bar kept us company while we waited.

We started out with the Dutch Bitterballen for appetizers. It was definitely a change in our usual calamari choice. My wife really enjoyed the curry ketchup and roasted garlic aioli it came with. She mixed them together too. The curry ketchup can definitely overpower it if you put a tad bit too much.

My wife ordered the Belgian Butter Burger because the bone marrow butter intrigued her. They weren't joking when they said bone marrow butter. She was confused that it was smack right on top of her burger. She removed some of it and used it on the side instead. She loved it. But she likes stuff like bone marrow. 

I ordered the Sconnie Burger. I ordered medium well, but not many places ever get it right. This is one of those places. The burger was decent. The cheese curds skewered on top was average. I actually ate the rest of my wife's burger at home and liked it better.

We'd come back here again. Probably not a Friday night. Our friends enjoyed their dishes (jambalaya and the seafood saute). We'll definitely try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is the third review of Cafe Hollander I've written - after my last \"not so great\" experience I had brunch with a big group of people, and I'm happy to report that the food (blueberry crepes?! YUM!)  and the service were much better.  I was thinking perhaps I could bump my review back up to four stars, but after another lackluster experience again this weekend, I feel like Cafe Hollander is just destined to be a three star restaurant. 

Some of the food was good - my daughter got the Cinnamon Streusel French Toast, and it was incredible. I tried the Maker's Mark Bourbon Butter Waffle, and it was pretty tasty, as well.  However, my \"over hard\" egg on the side was crazy runny, so much so that I couldn't bring myself to eat it and left the entire thing on my plate. My husband's eggs were cold and his potatoes, while flavorful, tasted like, in his words, \"they had been sitting under a warming light for a long time.\" He says, overall, his food tasted good, but none of it was the correct temperature.  

The service was just okay.  When our server brought the drinks she had forgotten what my husband wanted. Later in the meal, we ordered a second round of chocolate milk for our kids (parents of the year!!), and it took so long to bring them that by the time we had completely finished our meals. We (two parents and three kids who were rapidly losing patience) were all sitting at the table with our coats on ready to go before our server brought the check. I want to emphasize - I'm totally understand how busy they are on the weekend, but there is no reason we should have to sit for 10-15 minutes after our table has already been cleared for a check.  I want to love Cafe Hollander so much. All the menu items sound mouth-watering. The decor is so fun. They have a great beer selection. I keep going back hoping for greatness, and it just hasn't happened...and I'm losing faith that it ever will."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible recovery. After waiting to be greeted, we waited 40-minutes before we finally left. Will never come back again. Horrid."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was subpar. It took a very long time to get any attention from our server. We tried their signature drink, the Prairie Berry Mule cocktail and it was just ok. The cheese curds and burger were pretty good. I will go back to try other items on their menu and hopefully get a different server."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I come here other than for the beer selection and cool atmosphere. Who am I kidding, it's really neither. It's close, has a cool enough atmosphere and I really want this place to become a favorite. But the experience, including the consistently meh, questionable at best. Some of its good, some of it just meh especially for the price. Examples: Mussels and frites ok, but definitely not worthy of a review. Go to Graze. Ordered the chicken chili one day and chili is definitely a misnomer. It's a very bright, brothy soup, not even hearty and certain lacking the necessary thickness to merit the name chili. Result: go to the Dane. Everything is overpriced so you pay for the ambience. Don't waste your money on cocktails. Nothing crafty there or worthy of a trip. I want to love this place because I really love the atmosphere, but if I didn't I work nearby I'd never come here because I can never convince any of my friends that it's worth repeating and we go to vintage or anywhere else really. somehow every time I've been here (5x since they opened) I leave somewhere on the spectrum of angry and disappointed. Today is no different. Today, I'm eating a plate of overpriced wings (7 for $11) and will leave hungry rather than risk being disappointed and spending $40 on an entree and beer rather than the $25 I'm already in for 7 wing dings and a beer."}
{"text":"Here for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  Hubs got the BBQ Boar Benedict which was absolutely decadent.  I had the pretzel breakfast sandwich.  Totally filling and delicious.

Only 3 stars because the service was lax.  Confusion about seating when we checked in at the front desk.  Server did not come to our table for over 5 minutes to take our drink order despite the restaurant not being busy.  It wasn't due to lack of staff -- they were milling about everywhere.  Food runner brought the wrong food to our table.

The decor is nice and it is in a great location.  The food is quite good.  But the service is not all that good.  In fact, there was another server who walked around with a sneer on her face the entire time we were here, pointing her head towards tables that had offended her somehow.

Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Have been trying to dine here a couple of times for dinner but the line was out the door so opted for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Due to the long lines we were anticipating a fabulous experience but it was not to be. The restaurant decor is very nice. We were seated immediately and then waited and waited and waited for anyone, someone? to stop by to greet us and take our drink orders...and we waited and waited some more.  I noticed a man setting tables but thought he was a busboy. Finally, a woman stopped by to ask if anyone had come by to wait on us and my husband said \"no. we were wondering if there was any wait staff at this restaurant?\" The woman said she would find someone. Soon after, guess who came by? The guy I thought was the busboy! He had been more interested in setting tables than waiting on customers. After he started his \"real job\" he did a pretty good job as our waiter. The food was decent, nothing over the top.  I guess most people stop by for the beer options rather than the food. My husband made a comment that the employees looked a little shabby, I had to agree. Too many wonderful restaurant choices in Madison, if you're a new restaurant in town you have to hit it out of the ballpark the first time, every time. Will not return."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch last weekend, and I was impressed by the service and food. The atmosphere is laid back, and the \"we'll text you when your table is ready\" service is fabulous - it's a great location to wander and shop while you wait!

Our server was very funny and attentive, and my friend and I enjoyed his suggested drink, the beermosa. I had the Mediterranean omelet, and it was full of flavor with just the right amount of cheese for my taste (I don't like a lot in my eggs, personally). I definitely recommend this new addition to the already amazing Hilldale Mall."}
{"text":"It was a bit of a wait for a dink at the bar, it was very busy and the bartenders were not overly friendly.  However our meal was excellent and waiter was very good.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"After multiple attempts at coming back despite the bad service, this will be the last time I'm returning. As soon as I walked in, the hostess was annoyed and was standing around while I waited even though there was no one at the restaurant. Second, the waitress took forever, at least 10 minutes to even take our drink orders and once we got those in it took forever for her to come back and get our food orders. Finally, we ordered fries but they came cold and soggy. They gave us a new batch almost instantly which was weird considering they should have given us fresh fries to begin with. The server etiquette was not good here. Finally, after waiting forever for my food and not even being satisfied I went to the smoothie shop next door to get a smoothie bowl and as I came back, a few minutes later the manager came over and sourly told me that I couldn't eat it there even tho I was outside and countless people around us we're bringing outside food in from other places as well. After they messed up our orders, forgot our drinks, and had bad service, the manager still yelled at us. Also keep in mind we had a big group ordering a ton of food and quite an expensive bill and we were so polite to the waitress. Would not return, the customer service sucks and is so unprofessional and the food isn't even that good."}
{"text":"I love when I can sit outside in the summer with a beer or cocktail and have some good food to go along with. Their atrium area is beautiful as well-still get the feeling of being outside but a little more covered up. 

Beer selection is amazing with so many choices it takes me a long time to decide. (That's just because I'm a beer advocate) Lots of good German Belgian beer to choose from-as well as every other style. Even the pickiest of people could find something they enjoy. 

Food is always good. Their frites are delicious. They have sweet potato frites as well. Be sure to choose one of their aioli's to add an extra kick to the flavor. 

Service has been mostly good. The only complaint on that, is that the 3 times we have been there, we get seated and it takes the server awhile to get to us to order our drinks. 

I wish they had a happy hour. That would make me come back way more often! 

Overall, this is a nice place and especially take advantage in the warmer weather."}
{"text":"The beer selection is decent, but missing breadth on tap.  No stouts or porters on tap, just browns.  They have popular styles for college folks, which is OK.  The food?  Ok.  Nothing really good and our server even said there were dishes she wouldn't recommend!!  Burgers were OK, seafood dish over cooked.  Brunch there is good, and the Milwaukee Bloody is tasty.  Very much like Great Dane Brew Pub....in fact why there are two such similar places within two blocks, I don't get!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for an impromptu Easter brunch. Food was GREAT and priced about right -- the service was incredibly fast. Getting a bloody mary, cheese curds and entrees happened in times that made me quite happy considering the quality of the menu. Will definitely return! Only had a waffle so far but I'm going to try the vegetarian burger next time!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit Cafe Hollander. It's been so busy since opening that it's almost been impossible to try this place without having a very long wait. Thought it may be slowing a bit and was able to visit on a weeknight. Was able to get a table.

The beer list is quite impressive. Great selections. The food looks quite remarkable on paper but doesn't quite translate onto the plate. Vegetables were a little undercooked and frites had a little too much salt and cheese but honestly could just be a preference thing. My friend seemed to enjoy the food and there are lots of options so would make a return trip to give this place another chance. The service was overall okay but not very attentive."}
{"text":"First time visit was on my St. Patrick's Day birthday. Asked for a table, was told okay, and then given a booth? We couldn't sit comfortably but whatever.
I was all ready for some corned beef and cabbage! What?? Not on the menu?? Even the Pope said we could eat it on Friday! I stuck with a pretzel and cup of soup. BORING. I wanted my birthday lunch and was thrown off that there wasn't a St. Patrick's Day staple offered. Soup was nothing special, and it was tepid. Pretzel was good. We sat with empty glasses on our table for quite awhile, although waiter passed our table repeatedly. Not very personable either.  For me: FAIL"}
{"text":"Café Hollander tries so hard to be based on Belgian and Dutch roots, but misses the mark. 

While my wife's mussels were great, the steak that I had wasn't. My steak on the Steak and Frittes was cooked correctly, but (perhaps it's my unrefined palate) tasted burnt. 

The Frittes were strikingly similar to McDonald's French fries. 

For meatloaf, steak and frittes, 2 pounds of mussels, Mac and cheese, two beers, and two root beers, it cost us $125 with tip. 

Here's a tip for you: save your money and go to Brasserie V for a real Belgian experience."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture,  I just assumed there was some already of the kids meals. I can say I've never been to a restaurant that has perfected the kids meals menu as well as cafe hollander has. There meal comes out on a large plate that has 3 separate plates within it. The 3 groups consist of 
1- main dish & fries. We got two mini burgers & chicken strips. 
2 - fruit: mix of grapes, melons, & pineapple.
3. Vegetables: mix of carrots, cucumber,  &  celery. With side ranch. 
All for $6. I've paid more at other places and gotten much less quality food.
I got the BBQ boar sandwich with sweet potato fries - worth the up charge. 
We went on a Thurs and had no wait at 5:20. Service was good - basic and family friendly. Waters got refilled half way through. 
This place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Only been here once for brunch but it was a hit! I can't wait to get back and check it out at night. The food was perfect - the drinks a little pricey but hit the spot. Will definitely be back to check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Despite having adequate staff, their wait times are horrible and wait times for food after ordering simple uncomplicated meals are incredibly long. No on bothers to update you on the wait for your food, and you have to get their attention for anything. This only applies if you are eating at the bar. 
The quality of the food is good, though and I would recommended eating at a table for better service.!"}
{"text":"We've been fans of Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee & gave this one 2 tries. Not giving them a 3rd. The setting & decor is my favorite part of this restaurant. They don't have the meals we loved & we weren't wowed by the Plan B options. The Husband said his omelet was almost as good as Denny's. The final straw: I upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries with a curry ketchup, both at an extra charge.  The fries were so salty they were inedible. I told our server, not much in the way of \"opps\" or \"sorry\" & when the bill arrived, full price, no attempt to make it up to me. Okay, I'm done. Still need a Madison Cafe Hollander replacement, what do you suggest?"}
{"text":"Any place that has a variety of mimosas and Bloody Mary's instantly earns major points. All of the drinks looked amazing but we ended up getting the berry mimosa and the southsider Bloody Mary and they did not disappoint. 

It took me 20 minutes to figure out what I was going to be eat because I wanted everything. Definitely recommend the warm cheese plate - toasted crostinis and cheese and garlic, oh my!

Overall, this place is awesome! Definitely recommend next time you're at target or shopping around Hilldale!"}
{"text":"Needed a drink & some locals pointed us in this direction. Super glad we did because the beer, cheese curds, burger, & pretzel were great. I can't forget April our server was perfect to our every need! Not only did I love it but the family were big fans also! When in Madison again it will be a must stop!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Mke and loved the Cafe Hollander there, it was a staple for my friends and I, was so excited to see a new one pop up in Madison. Awesome food, and my hubby and I usually don't have to wait long for a table. I think we went during peek brunch times one Sunday and just hopped over to Macy's and received a text alert that our table was ready within 15 mins. We've only had one sub-par experience and that was when our waiter didn't write any of our order down so we got our food before she remembered to bring our drinks and my order was actually the wrong dish entirely when it did show up. But the food is soo yummy! Awesome Bloody's too."}
{"text":"Second time here. Ordered their meatloaf. Way to much salt. In gravy and meat. Wife's salad very spicy. Device was exceptional. Never complained to the about the ton of salt on food. Just won't order that item agan"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food and drink selection and have been hear several times. The brunch items are always fantastic and the portion are well sized. Not so much that you'll always have leftover, but enough that you feel sated. Our waiters have been a bit of a mixed bag. One was so fantastic that he even suggested drinks for us when we were having a hard time deciding between two options, in addition to being timely and funny. Another waitress was down right rude and sexist to the point she looked to the man at the table for all the orders, and did not speak or direct questions to the lady at the table. ((Which was extra frustrating because this was a celebration and the women was the one paying.)) However, in this instance the manager was extremely helpful and apologetic."}
{"text":"Thank you for the amazing experience last night!  We showed up last minute with a large group of 16 people. The manager took take of us immediately. He has a large table set up within 10 minutes. They also got our drink and appetizer orders taken super quickly. The food was fantastic. Everyone in our group loved what they ordered. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone has some critical reviews, but I lived it here! It was a massive place and most tables indoors were filled. I cant wait for warmer weather, the patios/decks look awesome! Service was good both times (went twice in a week, oops!) and had calamari, sconnie burger, the chicken blt/avocado wrap. All very good! The burger was juicy, cant wait to try the buttery Belgian burger. The wrap was surprisingly tasty, and for $11.95 I will surely be back. Good atmosphere, prices, food, service. It is a win for me, one of my new favorite spots! Go check it out."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service and the ambiance. Will be fabulous in the summer.

Nice selection of beer and a good size bar area for waiting. Lots of space downstairs and up, can't wait for the roof top to be open in summer. High ceilings and tons of windows along with wood interior make it light, open and cozy all at the same time.

The cheese curds app was solid and my burger was quite tasty. $12.50 for the specialty burger during brunch, with bacon and avocado. House salad is tasty, note it has blue cheese.

We will be going back for sure!! Excellent experience and combination of good!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:30 on a Wednesday with a 30 minute wait inside or immediate seating on the rooftop. We chose the rooftop. We ordered a beer, pretzel, steak and fries and a chicken chopped salad ($50). We we waited quite a while for food. The pretzel was nothing special. it wasn't warm, there was 1 dipping option: whole-grain seeded mustard (no cheese dip or any other options). then we waited forever for our entrées. People who came in after us ended up eating their entrees before us. It's hard for me to understand how steak and a salad could take so long. When the steak was served, there were 2 yummy garlic butter slabs on the top if the steak that never melted because The steak was served to us at room temperature and not hot off the grill. And the chicken salad while it was good, the lettuce was wilted; the salad dressing had sat on it way too long. Pretty unfortunate for a salad the cost almost $15-. For a new restaurant, I expected the staff to be a little lost, and they certainly were, the food runners didn't know which table was which numbers . But they were friendly staff. Could've done a better job trying to upsell, but that'll come in time. Letting food go cold or having a salad sit in the window long enough that the lettuce wilts is just uncalled for. We won't be back. I might as well have lit a $50 bill on fire. We were not satisfied. Well my husband enjoyed the beer actually. We Would like to have told the managers but no one was around. Tried to find a \"contact us\" on the website, but there isn't any. So here you go-yelp."}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated. No one approached my table for  15 minutes. No welcome. No water. No waitstaff. 3 other tables were seated and were given drinks while  I sat there. Got up. Told the manager that the service Sucked and not even an apology or acknowledgement. NEVER returning. They're lucky I don't do restaurant reviews on LIVE AT FOUR ...YET!"}
{"text":"We received more than an exceptional meal from an even more exceptional server! Thank you so much Bridgette, for making my brothers visit from Alaska a more than memorable experience."}
{"text":"Over all a great experience. Good food, great beer selection. Went on a Saturday night, early, and it was still busy. So plan ahead."}
{"text":"Good food, but the beer and alcohol is incredibly overpriced.  9 dollars for a beer is outrageous."}
{"text":"Stopped here last weekend for lunch, and even though it wasn't my first trip, I enjoyed it so much I decided to finally leave a review. The Sconnie burger is what I get every single time, and I am never disappointed. Paired with a good beer, you really can't go wrong with any of the burgers. The atmosphere is fun and the place is huge, with two floors. Very spacious and open, with plenty of seating. A great place to watch the Badgers and Packers play on any of the big screens!"}
{"text":"It amazes me that in the midst of such a beautiful space that obviously cost the owners a gazillion dollars in architect fees alone that they could staff the place with a continuous line of dickweeds as bartenders.  While this has happened several times with different people (all gone) I will use Last night (11/26/17) is an example. But I will say this example was possibly the worst service I've ever had.  The bartender was wearing a Montee Ball UW Jersey big guy with a beard , so if you are his manager you can handle it.  He was singularly the poster child for being rude, slow, and inattentive.  The other patrons and I were having a nice bonding moment by talking about what a jerk the guy was.  Ignored us for a while, no eye contact, never smiled, literally grabbed our check and wadded it in his hand when we paid (I did leave a tip that I now regret) not even looking at it or saying \"thanks\".  I don't know if his dog died, his girlfriend broke up with him (good riddance!) or he had a wicked hangover but for god's sake dude, leave your anger for the unemployment line because you are gonna need it."}
{"text":"The food is great and the drink selection is out of this world. But the service is insanely terrible. I've been there on a few occasions and have had inattentive servers each time (including multiple different ones during the same meal). We had to flag down our waiters after they forgot about our table and it wasn't even busy. Heads up that they also charge for a side of ranch. I wanted to love this place but the service has turned me off every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Wow so many beers! We went for dinner one night and were impressed at how gorgeous and huge the space is inside. We were overwhelmed at how many beer choices there were.

  For food I highly recommend the pretzel appetizer and the shrimp po'boy served in Challah bread. Absolutely delicious, food is made with attention to detail! Great food,  friendly and quirky staff and beautiful belgian bike decor. Nice work bringing it to Madison Milwaukee!"}
{"text":"Huge cafe with so many options for seating. The waitress mentioned being able to serve over 400. Loved the atmosphere. We sat outside in the shade area and it was really nice. All the sandwiches we ordered were really good. The Bloody Mary that my brother ordered was amazing. He says he's picky about his bloody Mary's too. Only complaint would be that we did wait awhile to get our food but they do serve a lot of people"}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander offers quite good bar food in a fun vintage/industrial bar atmosphere. 

I've now visited Cafe Hollander on three occasions. I like to get the salmon kale salad, which is likely the healthiest item on the menu but is delicious. I've also tried several appetizers: cheese platter, ceviche and cheese curds. All have been excellent. Cafe Hollander's cheese curds -- judging on both the quality of the curd and the deep fry -- are fairly comparable to the Old Fashioned's cheese curds. And that says something!

The servers have all been friendly and efficient, although every time I've gone to Cafe Hollander, the host staff people all seem a little clueless. 

I'll go back soon."}
{"text":"An excellent choice if you're planning on sitting outside on the roof. Their chicken and waffles is superb- the recipe was recently reconfigured! A definite Sunday brunch spot. (Mmmmm mimosa)
One evening we ordered their \"unlimited\" fish fry, which I do not recommend. When we put in our second order of fish we were told that they only wanted us ordering one more piece of fish! The server had to be sneaky about serving us more fish, just weird. However we ended up getting our food and everything worked out. Overall we really do enjoy the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, the second time was even better. Cafe Hollander is now fully open and you can order anything on the menu. I got the chicken fusilli - comfort food at its finest. It's thick and hearty and reminds one of home made chicken noodle soup on steroids. The orange zest sets the flavor off perfectly and the portion is large enough to make both dinner and lunch for the next day. Awesome. In addition, Madison is having a rare heat wave in October and the whole bottom floor has been opened up to the outside air. The atmosphere could not be better for a beer or two. I love this place.

Some personnel are still being trained, but the overall operation seems smooth. I had been watching an employee pouring beer without tilting the glass at all. This was quickly corrected when the bar manager came over for a quick lesson ."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, and this place rocked.  Great open area, nice service, decent food.  Will definitely go back when i am in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times for brunch. Love their brunch menu and their bloody Mary's are amazing! Tonight I had dinner with my husband. We ate upstairs and the acoustics aren't great (noisy) , but my dish was fantastic. I ordered the Mac and cheese with chorizo added. My server,Adam ( professional, friendly, and informative) suggested that I add some veggies. Yum! Added tomatoes, red pepper, mushroom and broccoli rabe.  I would highly recommend it. And ask to sit in Adams section. He's great!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic Madison choice. They boast a HUGE selection of bottled and tap beers and also have a great cocktail list. One of my favorite things about the place is the upstairs and how the whole place is basically made out of windows. I went in the winter, but really want to check this out in the summer. They have cool bikes hanging from the walls and ceilings."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander is an upscale Belgian-style cafe-bistro on the west side of the Hilldale Mall. They have comfortable patio seating and an airy bar area with lots of seats and over 30 beers on tap.

As one might expect, you won't find any Miller Lite on tap; they have a wide selection of mainly European wheat beers, each of which is served in its own distinctive mug. I arrived hoping for a beer and pretzel snack around 2:40pm. The waitress told me that they only serve their brunch menu on the weekends. My grandfather really recommended the pretzel, and when I asked if we could have one, the waitress rolled her eyes and told me they only serve those after 3pm... I politely asked for an exception (it was 2:45pm and the place was empty) and I was denied... In the end, we had various appetizers. The sweet potato fries (\"frites,\" as they're called at Hollander) were decent, and the pair of beers I had were alright. 

I had a pecan pie with vanilla ice cream, which was also just okay (the pecans were fine, but the crust was stale supermarket crust). The waitress made her self scarce during our short snack, and it was hard to get to ultimately get the bill.

In summary,

Service - 2/5
Food 2.5/5
Beer - 4/5.

Feeling generous, so let's call it 3 stars."}
{"text":"A busy place, a loud space. Great place for a delicious Tripel Karmeleit, excellent patio in nice weather. If you sit inside be prepared to yell over those sitting nearby. Food is two star, photogenic and nice to look at. Definitely enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here four times and each time I hope I'll like it better. It's a solid beer-centric restaurant,  but that's not particularly special these days.  The food is good, but I've never had something that makes me want to come back. The service is spotty months after they opened, in terms of waiting for a table and a server.  One visit we were given free dessert because things had gotten screwed up so badly (which was a nice gesture) but then my child was nearly served an alcoholic root beer float. The server caught that mistake as it was being delivered to our table thankfully, but it really doesn't inspire confidence. 

If given the choice,  I'll choose the Great Dane (other side of Hilldale) for a similar style restaurant. If I wanted nearly endless beer choices, I'd either hit up Long Table or HopCat."}
{"text":"Great space but worst.service.ever; when I voiced this, no apology or acknowledgment.  Last straw when management couldn't even find server for 10 minutes!! Still no apology from them either.
#getittogetherhollander"}
{"text":"Great portions, tasty food, fast service, clean venue, and affordable prices. What's not to like? I came here to have a solo breakfast, and I was in and out in less than 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been back a handful of times since my initial review and each visit has been progressively worse than the last, both in food and service.

I've tried quite a bit from the menu now. At one time everything sounded so appealing, but upon ordering I'm always very disappointed with my food. Their cafe burger is boring, the fork & knife burger a total waste of nearly $15 for what you get (seriously almost criminal), and the egg white omelette a bland mess. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong entrees, but with a large menu like this I believe everything should be on point or you should focus on what you're good at and just serve that.

I know that being a server is hard work. That's an undeniable truth. But, with that said, I believe that the servers at Cafe Hollander could really benefit in more training. They're so busy, especially on the weekends when the line goes out the door, and I kind of get the sense that there isn't any sound management or teamwork and everyone is there to fend for themselves. The weekdays are about the same. I also understand that servers have nothing to do with getting their patrons food out in a timely matter, but a quick breakfast truly shouldn't end up taking 2 hours when there's just two of you in your party, and you order the same thing.

It's consistently slow, bland, and chaotic and I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander comes to Madison in a big way... They opened a stunningly beautiful, brand-new restaurant at Hilldale that seats 450 - featuring an amazing second floor patio, retractable roof, and garage door windows around the whole first floor that open. The Madison restaurant scene has escalated to another level, especially in the Hilldale area.

We visited during the soft opening, so there were some hiccups, but if it's as good as the Milwaukee location, things will be great in no time. Out of the 7 in our group, most either liked or loved their food. Their beer selection and brunch menu is strong, and that's what they focus on.

Prices are not too high but don't get comfortable, they add up quickly - $9 for a bloody, $5-7 for beer, $2 extra for side salad, etc."}
{"text":"Beautiful! Had my first experience with Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee and fell in love with the place (nearly fainted when I heard it was coming to Madison). I'd say moderately priced considering the portion/amount size. My favorite is the wait staff.. So attentive, kind, and genuine. An amazing place to take your significant other for a date night or your whole family for a fun Sunday brunch. Lots of tables, lots of space and an overall laid back environment which I know many look for in a chill dining experience. On weekends, I'd recommend making a reservation/calling ahead of time, just in case. Impressed and can't wait to go back. Don't forget to order the frites!
Happy eats. 
Aloha"}
{"text":"We've been here three times now. The first time we went, the place was brand new so we chalked up any terribleness to that. Tonight, my boyfriend tried to make a reservation there and whoever he spoke to said you could only do that on their app. My boyfriend is a dinosaur and doesn't have a smart phone, so I tried to find their app with no success. When we got there, we explained this to someone who was the manager of something. I have no idea what he was the manager of except maybe smugness. He was EXTREMELY rude and told us that they don't want people making reservations and he also said he knew nothing about an app. The food was good tonight. Our waitress was very nice. But don't try making reservations, I guess. They're too cool for that shit."}
{"text":"Mixed experiences. Some better, some worse, none exceptional.

It tends to be a very busy place an often has a wait even during the week. It moves fast though.

I usually get burgers here and they are always ok but never great. The one I got today was a little undercooked (I asked medium well and came out on the rare side of medium) and had probably been sitting a while because on top of being coldish the cheese had already congealed and the fried curds on top of the burger where not molten any more. In previous occasions I don't remember having the same problem with temperature, but I still remember burgers being a bit on the dry side.

I think it is a great place for a beer. But not the best place for eating."}
{"text":"This is a fun, nice looking place with good service but the food misses the mark. For brunch on Sunday we had an excellent bloody mary but that unfortunately was the best part of the experience. My Belgium waffle was dense and flavorless and the syrup that came with it was not much better. The side of bacon I ordered with it saved the day. Thick cut and crispy, it would have made a great sandwich.  My partner had the eggs benedict which was sub par as well. The eggs were actually cooked perfectly but the sauce didn't have the lemon \"bite\" she was used to and the muffin was not toasted enough. She used the word \"lackluster\" and was disappointed. The placed was packed with diners and  is a popular place but I doubt that this overpriced mediocre food is the draw.  I guess the location and bar might be."}
{"text":"I have heard stories about the high cost low portion beers here. I am not a fan of the suds so I went to try the food. I heard about a burger they served called the butter burger. It has a complex marrow butter, mushrooms, and brie on top served with an au jus. It is served with frites. The price is a whopping $14!!!
The service was good. The portions are good. It is not a defining concoction in hambergerland. The char flavor of the grill was the most dominant flavor. Definitely not worth $14. Of course the cohort of customers is largely made up of the wealthy residents of Shorewood - doctors and university professors who don't care about value. Interesting interior. Not overly wallpapered with TVs like all bars are."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, and realized why we haven't been here in awhile.  I feel like the food is overpriced for what it is.  Tonight we spent $85+ for 4 entrees, an app and drinks (+one beer).  They updated their menu recently, and the server said no substitutions (other than allergies) because they were still working on getting the menu down.  The server did ok, but somehow we had 2 servers, which was confusing.  Lesson learned, we will find other places."}
{"text":"We had quite an annoying issue with the method of in-house table reservations. We arrived on a Thursday evening and reserved for our party of six. They took my cell phone number and told me 10-20 minutes, \"we'll just text you\". No problem, we thought, because we wanted to have a drink anyway. TWO minutes later something opened up and I was texted. However, I was busy getting a drink and didn't hear the text. Fifteen minutes later I got curious and checked, which is when I discovered the annoying policy. I was informed, by the SAME text that if I didn't respond within ten minutes, I'd be dropped to the back of the reservation line. Which they did. We still wanted to eat, so we stated the process over. A half an hour later, nothing was opening up, so we ended up eating at the bar. The food ended up being good, that is not my complaint. I hope this reservation system is replaced because it did not work AT ALL for us. This experience really stained our opinion of Cafe Hollander."}
{"text":"37 minutes... Glasses are empty and no waiter to be found.   We sat down 37 minutes ago placed our order, got our drinks and seem to have fallen in a deep abyss... I am not going to even bother rating the food as I will not come back here.   Terrible terrible service.   40 minutes now and still no waiter... The people next to us who sat down and just received their food.. We did not.  Surprise!  We just received our food.  I will comment on the food.  The ketchup was new as my wife just had to remove the cap to peel away the seal.  Yea!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes. The rumors are true. The staff is unfriendly, the service is slow and inattentive and the food left quite a bit to be desired. We came in on a whim for Sunday brunch (mostly brought in on a whim due a City Tin gift). The place was packed but we were able to grab two seats at the bar. After that stroke of luck, it was pretty much all downhill from there.

There were three bartenders working-well, one was mostly doing prep work-cutting up fruit, etc-and only occasionally tending to patrons. The other two were working hard but we sat and sat and sat and still finally had to flag someone down to even get menus. The need for flagging someone down continued and each time they just seemed annoyed. 

Our food took forever and while we waited, we watched four dishes just from the bar area alone be sent back to the kitchen. Not a good sign. When our food finally did arrive, it was very disappointing. I had asked for no tomatoes (ordered the bacon avocado chicken wrap) and they were on there :( Frites were lukewarm and the chicken was incredibly dry. The Sriracha ranch was all clumped up on one side of the wrap-so much so that after my first few bites, I thought they had forgotten in it. I'm not one to complain or send things back but even I wanted to, it would have been close to impossible due to the inattentiveness of the waitstaff. My bf \"didn't mind\" his eggs benedict which is his usually his polite way of saying, \"it wasn't that good.\"

The plus side: the space is awesome. I lived in Milwaukee for a few years and have been to their sister restaurants and other than the rooftop patio at Cafe Benelux, this is easily the best space of the group. Unfortunately it's not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Over...wait for it...rated.

Okay, so the Lowland Group Cafe (insert name of one of 10 different Milwaukee locations) is no big news to me. I lived right down the street from the Cafe Centraal location in Bay View, and while the meal was always solid, it was nothing special. However, they do make a bloody good Bloody Mary, and I was hankering for some booze on this particular evening!

After seeing Suffragette at the lovely Sundance theater, my best gal pal and I headed over on a blistery Winters eve around 6:45. 30 min wait. Ah, what? Okay. I'm not the kind of gal who usually waits that long (I'm usually always mad hangry and need to eat immediately) I decided to stick it out for the bloody mary's.

Atmosphere. One word. LOUD (as fuck).
I was yelling at my friend the whole evening, went home hoarse.

Bloody: Ordered the Godfather which is a Caprese Bloody. So darn good. Also, 11 dollars. Literally cost more than me meal.

Food: Eh, average. Ordered a warm hummus plate which was described as warm hummus, roasted veggies and pita. Didn't realize the veggies were piled on top of the warm hummus as opposed to use for dipping. Wasn't practical, but taste was decent! Ordered a cone of frites and got, fries. I'm sure they are still working themselves out, but frites are (from my humble understanding) supposed to be twice fried crispy lil things. These were big ol honking things with tons of potato. Delicious, but not frites.

To top off the average evening, we were sat upstairs, which has a glass window on top (I'm assuming which can be moved for warm weather) Great idea, but drafty as HECK on a 40 degree, 25 mile an hour wind night. 

Also, we were seated next to a LOVELY family with 5 children, all of whom were running around like god dang monkeys while the parents ignored the children running into waitresses. Get your demon seed under control Madison!

Overall, eh. Food is okay, booze is great, but the atmosphere made the evening far less enjoyable then it could have been."}
{"text":"I border on 3-4 Stars because Café Hollander is pretty good for what it is, it's solid most of the time, and they not only have a good selection of beer, they tell you which beers to have with your food.  I'm a fan of brunch here, and their outside seating.  I am not a fan of waiting for a long time for something that isn't that awesome. 
I usually get the prime rib hash that they have for brunch. 
Their bloodies are great."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad! We met up with some friends who'd been here before, so they urged us to order the Dutch Bitterballen for appetizers. Really interesting. Very tasty with the curry ketchup and garlic aioli. 

I decided to be somewhat adventurous and order the Belgian Butter Burger because the bone marrow butter caught my attention. Usually, my go-to is a mushroom swiss burger or a bleu cheese burger. Definitely did not regret my choice! My meat was medium rare as requested and the butter was delicious, along with the au jus dip. My husband ate the rest of it at home and he really enjoyed it too. 

We'd probably come here again, especially if we're shopping around the area."}
{"text":"The service and food were good.  I would give this place a higher rating, but the noise level was off the chart.  I don't like to shout to my dining partners to be heard."}
{"text":"Great account, they did a wonderful job creating the space and the food was on point. Unfortunately for them I was there on the soft opening and the service was awful!"}
{"text":"Drinks & apps only.  Both were good.  Bar service was good - soft pretzel and beer cheese was super. The place is super cool.  If your into Belgium beers then you will love the tap selection.  Noticed the service complaints in other reviews - I think that is just reflective of a shortage of good help in Madison.  8/10 places in town right now have lame staffing in my opinion."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander immediately struck me as a superior version of the Great Dane: the space is vast, the beer menu is equally daunting, and the menu is fairly middle-of-the-road, designed to please most anyone. By comparison, Hollander's service is better, its menu more interesting, the food a step above Dane's, and the atmosphere more inviting. But beyond that, it still has the feel of a chain restaurant in many ways - a high brow answer to the Cheesecake Factory. The portions are absurdly large, lots of dishes overseasoned, and the general look pretty generic. If you're looking for a decent burger after a stop at Hilldale, definitely stop in. But if you're just visiting Madison, try out a restaurant that actually bears the stamp of the city and the people who live here. This place feels like the Disney theme park version of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"First time it was decent.  Second time I took my sister there for her birthday.  Service was horrible, food was cool and they couldn't even get the buns right on the burger I had two bottoms . My son had hair in his food. Send it back to only have it returned with Yes, more hair!!! Waiter said he didn't believe him, manager barely apologized.  Needless to say, we have NO PLANS on going back"}
{"text":"Go there for the frites aka fries! The fries were really good! I had mine with the garlic aioli and chipotle aioli. I recommend both \"sauces\". The frites came seasoned and didn't need anything.

We ordered 2 orders of cheese curds -thank god because they are skimpy on the servings. Calamari, frites, and a naked burger, spiced pear sangria and a mulled berry cocktail. I don't think the food choices were that great. Definitely not the place to take a picky eater but they are accommodating. 

The calamari was light and crispy but for almost $12 I would like more calamari and less peppers. The sauce it came with didn't pair well in my opinion. I ended up dipping it in my chipotle aioli. The cheese curds were good, my son didn't care for the sauce to dip it in but I didn't mind it. My sangria was good. 

The service was mediocre. We didn't have a long wait but had so many different people bring us our items I don't know who our tip went to. We dined on the upper patio/balcony and they couldn't use the umbrellas because of the wind but left the umbrellas in the middle of our table so we couldn't see each other! Also when we got our burger with fries they only gave us about 8-10 fries-we had to ask for another side of fries which they gave us on the house. 

I'll be back again because the atmosphere is nice but they really should offer drink and appetizer specials. The prices and portions don't match!"}
{"text":"The first few times we tried The Hollander, we really liked it. Then the last three times, slowly but surely it went sour!  What the heck happened?  We even emailed the manager with NO RESULTS. Which was disheartening, because we thought the first few times were really awesome, and why can't it be like when they first opened?  The food = I had mussels and frets. I got a lb. and I get these a lot all over town.  Jac's my favorite by far, but the Hollander was taking over. Until he last two times the mussels were like 1/2 the amount and the 3 time well..it was insulting. When I respectfully questioned the waitress, she went back to the chef, came back and said they weight them before hand it it was right.  I said thank you.  The next time I went to Jac's, my waitress asked I said they are tough, and she promptly took them back and brought me the most wonderful tasty mussels ever.  Sorry Hollender, you were so good at first but 3 times but now, you are out.  Good luck, Madison is a hard town to be successful in, and when you don't care, neither do we. My best advice, try Jac's on Monroe. Peace!"}
{"text":"We were excited about this place opening up as its close to our house and the exterior looked pretty cool- who doesn't get excited about all of those beers on tap???  We went for breakfast at the end of February and while still pregnant, I ordered a decaf coffee.  We also ordered a few breakfast \"apps\" and entrees too.  I think all of the food had arrived before the decaf coffee so that was a bummer.  The food was good- we were excited about coming back.

Fast forward to today for easter lunch.  We were just looking for something simple, quick, and lively so this was the place.  The experience today started with my husbands beer of choice being out of stock.  Too funny to have all of those beers and be told that the ONE you select is gone.  

Also the food today was very disappointing.  I got a grilled cheese that was very soggy, lacked flavor, and was not hot.  The fries can't decide if they are seasoned or not (I wish they weren't) and the serving of fries was minimal.  There was nothing else on the plate and it looked very amateur....a pickle maybe??   My husband got a cafe burger that was supposed to come with onions but didn't.  Our daughters grilled chicken strips came out as fried.  Attention server F, write the orders down...this inevitably happens if you don't.  I still will come back and try for a warm weather happy hour but it just dropped stock in my book."}
{"text":"The beer selection is impressive and we love it when they open the windows in the summer. We appreciate that they do a great job making the burgers to order as we prefer med-rare."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bars in Madison and I cannot for the life of me figure out why this place has such a low average rating. I've had brunch here a half-dozen times and had a FANTASTIC experience each time, with great food and impeccable service. Between my family members, we've tried just about everything on the menu and it's always too-notch. The Bloody Marys are a bit pricy, but unique and well-made with great, interesting flavors. The house beers easily hold up to any other craft brewery in town. Almost everything is made fresh and in-house. It can get crowded so be sure to use the No Wait app to get on the wait list before you leave home."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Staff seems to know the menu well and also which ingredients can be removed and which can't. I'm not a beer drinker but I enjoy lunch or dinner here. Food is a bit pricier but it's a bit more unique so it's worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"A huge F for Cafe Hollander: Fun! Fresh! Flavorful! Fabulous!

This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'll be back often. 

The service was friendly in a very nice way without being in your face or overbearing.

The menu has a great variety and there are so many things I can't wait to try. 

Parking is very convenient with a huge lot right out the front door.

We stopped after a movie at Sundance on a Saturday night and were seated right away.

We had the mushroom risotto, Rocket salad and a bowl of chili. All were excellent, fresh and flavorful and plated nicely. The herbs and flavors on the risotto were very tasty and nicely done. The Rocket salad was generous and dressed just right, not too much and not too little and very tasty. The chili was a large, generous bowl and also flavorful with a quarter waffle on the side. It would be nice to add garnishes like grated cheese, chopped onions and sour cream. 

One thing I like about this place is they use good china and silverware. Many of the local restaurants strive for fresh farm to table food, but cheap out on the silverware and china. It's nice to have good quality utensils to enjoy the great food. 

Emma, our wait person, was great and a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times the waiter/waitress were friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed my food the first visit (veggie burger). Not very impressed the second time around (turkey avocado wrap). The cocktails are pretty sugary. Beer selection is extensive. I will likely give them another try in the future but I will be in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander has a very beautiful facility and the food is excellent. The Bloody Mary's are dec. Service is friendly enough and competent which is more important.

What amazes me every time I go there is the quality of their food. I've had quite a few different menu items at this point and everything tastes amazing. I was literally eating a pretzel breakfast sandwich last week and thought to myself \"what a great time to be alive.\" Just because the food tasted so good. Very pleased with Cafe Hollander and wish them continued success. Now that summer has arrived I look to ha e some great nights out eating and dining on their outdoor patios."}
{"text":"So here's the thing with Cafe Hollander - it's got a great location, engaging atmosphere, spacious indoor/outdoor seating options, a big menu and good drinks but....the food and the service blows. This rather blunt statement comes after a brunch gone wrong with spilled coffee and finding not one but TWO HAIRS in 2 separate meals at our table!  Super duper gross.  

I've eaten here on 3 previous occasions (2 breakfasts & 1 dinner) and they've all been mediocre with lame service. I think I'm throwing in the towel. Will likely only be back to drink at the bar."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Cafe Hollander, one of Madison's most talked about new restaurants of the year.

The building itself is VERY impressive.  Lots of natural light (more about this later), wood, high ceilings, and very cool classic cycling decor throughout (it's a Belgian cafe, and cycling/bike racing is a big part of Belgian culture).  It's a very cool atmosphere.  

We sat in a section whose outside wall is like plexiglass garage doors that can open up in the summer (about 38° today, so they were closed) that let a lot of light in, with skylights above.  Even on an overcast day, it was really nice and bright, which made the meal even more enjoyable.  I've always wondered why more places in Madison don't do this.  I'm really looking forward to coming here when the weather gets nice.  (On my bike, so I can use their cool outdoor bike hooks!).

Several Belgian beers are on tap, including several seasonal holiday choices.  The bottle list is very extensive, so be sure to page through the book if none of the draft beers catch your eye.  The food menu also lists beer pairings with most if not all of the entrees.  Beers are on the pricey side, but Hollander is definitely not the only establishment to be part of that disturbing trend.

My wife and I both enjoyed our food - I had the steak skillet and she had a wrap.  The sirloin tips were perfect, tender and medium to medium well, and the whole skillet was tied together nicely with Hollandaise sauce.  She had the turkey & avocado wrap with Hollander potatoes (fries were also offered as an option) and liked it a lot.  

Our server was friendly and attentive and our food came out quickly - she even remarked that it was particularly fast (I think we hit the sweet spot between early and later brunch-goers).

We'll definitely be back, and the atmosphere at Hollander makes it a place we'll look forward to bringing guests to visit."}
{"text":"It's overpriced, bland food. Thought I would give it a try, but with so many other local, delicious places in town, you're better off going downtown or near Willy Street."}
{"text":"-service seems to ALWAYS suck here no matter who the waiter is
-every meal I have had here sucks- like in every way too- like it will look bad, taste bad, and have bad texture... Like the dish was conceptualized by someone who completely doesn't understand food
-the beer is really expesive
-I feel like people only like it because the interior looks cool
-I have talked to several friends who have also had negative experiences with both the food AND the service
-this review is based on multiple trips there... Like I said, unfortunately people seem to like to go here, I think it is because of how it looks.
-DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"I'm glad it's here in Hilldale. It's a welcome addition and it brings in more foot traffic to the Hilldale area. I tried to come here on a Friday at 7:30pm and the wait was 45 minutes. No thanks. Tried again on a Sunday evening and had much better luck. 

The food selection is better than the Great Dane which is right nearby. The beer selection is better than the Dane. I also enjoy the plentiful and interesting selection of scotch and bourbon. But, this place can get loud. On the Sunday night we were here, the restaurant was maybe only half full so it wasn't too bad. 

We ordered the jambalaya, the quinoa skillet, and frites to share. I enjoyed that each item on their menu is paired with a beer. We ordered the suggested pairings with the jambalaya and the quinoa skillet. The jambalaya had lots of spice, but we wish it came with more rice. The quinoa skillet was good, but I wanted some contrast in texture, like a crispy bacon. The frites were delicious, but too salty for me - though that goes very well with beer. 

I would definitely come back because it's close to me and better food than the Dane."}
{"text":"I'm hoping that my next trip to CafeHollander will be better-- I had high hopes for this place because it is such a good location, but I was there for brunch on a Sunday and waited an hour to be seated (which I expected), but then once we got seated our food took almost an additional hour until it came. We were missing part of our meal so we waited even longer, and our server didn't offer to pay for our drinks or give us anything on the house. Overall it wasn't a great experience but I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, it was a warm early summer day and the entire restaurant has a nice open air feel. Food was great, 4 stars only because they had run out of the item I ordered and I had to find an alternative."}
{"text":"Fun architecture with a bicycle theme and great brunch atmosphere. Group of us did a Saturday morning brunch. Service was a team approach with a lot of attention and smiles. They handled splitting checks with aplomb (including separating then combining for some with grace). I had a skillet that matched the description (not exactly what I expected, but I was not reading the descriptions real close - better conversation). The bloody Mary selection looked impressive and fun.  Looking forward to returning in the summer when many of the overhead doors will open up and let the fresh air in, in the meantime a bright and sunny place to enjoy the indoors."}
{"text":"I have visited the Hollander a couple of times in December 15 and January -February 16 with my adult son.

We both agree that the food is very tasty.  The last time were went, I ordered the meatloaf and he ordered the turkey avocado chicken wrap; both are highly recommended.  Truth be told we have not had a bad meal there.

The portion sizes are definitely smaller than at a place like the Great Dane (close by), and tend to be a bit more pricey, but the quality and taste are definitely there.

The beer selection is outstanding with the beers organized by type.

I will be back, but not as frequent as I would if they knocked a couple dollars off of everything."}
{"text":"Service: 7.5/10
Austin was our server, did a good job. Made sure all orders were correct and multiple interaction about food after received. Almost too many asked over 5 times...

Food: 8/10 
Ordered mussels and frites (basil aioli and curry tomato sauce). Food came out in good time, the mussels sauce was fantastic, a bit disappointed with about 7 of my mussels still closed. Frites were very crisp and soft on the inside, our regular ketchup was empty, and nothing was done about it, however the basil aioli was very good, however the curry tomato sauce was a bit too strong and sweet. Also never offered a dessert menu.

Overall: 7.5/10
Lovely decor, tables were a bit too small for two people, and music was very loud. It made it quite hard to hear, however not bad music. Would be happy to come here again for a meal."}
{"text":"What a strange place. I would expect a restaurant that serves this type of food (which I would describe as trendy, elaborate, and demanding for chefs) to be quaint, but Cafe Hollander is huge! Its layout brings chains like Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory to mind, but its artsy decor and exploratory menu sets it apart from those chains. That being said, I didn't find the food to be particularly impressing. My omelette was good and the fries were painfully average. I tried sips of my friends' Bloody Mary drinks... they seemed to enjoy them, but I thought they tasted like A1 steak sauce, and that ruined it for me. The cheese curds were pretty mangled because they were so small and hollowed out so that the cheese grouped them into clumps. Blehhhh! In general, I do love the idea of an upscale chain like this, so I'm glad it exists. I just probably won't be back if I'm lookin for exceptional food!"}
{"text":"It really bugs me when a restaurant strives to be just a little better than mediocre.  The food was good, but not great.  The sangria was watered down with Sprite.  The prices were a dollar or two too high... it was like this place thought, \"I know, we'll serve burgers, a million types of beer, some trendy apps, and locates ourselves close to the university, but not on campus. We'll make a mint!\"

Our family tried Cafe Hollander on a Saturday night, before it got busy.  The service was actually quite good, and they took care to seat us at a table where my 5 year old would be more comfortable without us asking.  We ordered a summer pear sangria and a draft Grimbergen Dubbel.  The beer came out and it was barely filled over half way.  We asked about it, and the waitress pointed to a line etched on the glass and said that's how far they pour.  Ironically, the last 1/2 inch was all head, so it wasn't even actually filled that high... and it was labeled .25L, which would be 250ml.  Later we noticed that in addition to being short of the .25, the menu actually said it was a 300 ml pour, so we were really shorted!  At $6.50 a glass for the equivalent (when actually filled to the line) of 8.4 oz, that's a $13 glass of beer for a typical 16 oz pint!

My sangria tasted good, but watered down.  It could have been the ice in the wine glass or the Sprite, but I don't think I've ever had Sangria without fruit in it!

We got a beet and avocado salad, and that was really good.  I would order that again.  We also ordered a blue belly burger.  It was good, but not amazing.  For $15, I would have expected something a little better... and you don't even get local/grass fed beef unless you order the burger that specifically advertises it!

My daughter had a kid's meal of buttered noodles, and that was a really nice kid's meal.  In addition to the main course, the kids also get veggies with ranch dip and fresh fruit.

It was good, but not great.  I feel like everything about that place - from the medium-quality ingredients to the packed-like-sardines table layout - screams \"increase profit!\"  I wouldn't go there again, but if someone suggested it for a group, I wouldn't object.  However, with so many other good restaurants with nice beer selections and good food in the area, I think they had better step up their game if they want to survive."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but the appalling indifference of the wait staff is inexcusable. Food arrives cold or wrong and you practically have to tackle the staff for a coffee refill."}
{"text":"The bloody Mary's were great.  Had the BBQ boar Benedict for brunch and it was excellent.  Long wait time starting around 1pm on the weekends, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Everything is good.  The beer is kind of expensive for what you get, but they have a great selection.  Food is also good.  Bloodies are ok."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to chill on a sunday afternoon. Perfect Chill, spacious Vibe to have some drinks. Ordered the quiche and fries to share which turnes out better than expected - light eggy quiche with a large portion of crispy fries. Order the beer sampler and had 4 interesting beers with Citradelic being my favourite as it smelt and tasted very zesty. Other beers included boerreding pilsner, piraat (very champagne like) and troub blonde (easy to drink hoppy beer)
Overall: 
5/5 for ambience 
5/5 for beer selection 
4.5/5 for food."}
{"text":"I have been to Hollander several times. Every time has been enjoyable. The service has always been attentive and friendly and the food has always been good. I've tried several of their entree salads as well as a burger, which had bacon and cheese and was absolutely huge (a half pound I believe). I'll keep coming back as the place is huge, the menu is very large and the atmosphere is relaxed. Everything about this place is enjoyable. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch or a casual dinner out with the family."}
{"text":"Went out for brunch with a group, we had a sandwich and two skillets. The wait staff didn't attend to us for almost 10min after we first sat down. The skillets were oily, like, really oily, probably half an inch of oil. Same problem with tables around us, saw someone rejecting her skillet. Doesn't seem to matter which kind, all of them are dripping in oil. I got the hot mess, which they hit the MESS perfectly and completely off on the \"hot\". Location is great, lots of people despite the overall mediocre reviews. Wished they would step up their cooking and treat their customers with better food and service."}
{"text":"This is my first time at cafe Hollander.  I actually thought it would be really good food because of the lines.  I had brunch and ordered the chicken and corn bread waffle with a side of Hollander potatoes. Everything was cold. The egg yolk was totally congealed, the gravy was cold, the waffle was cold, the potatoes were cold.  I ate just enough so that I wasn't hungry anymore. I even asked for cheese curds, which turned out to be burnt.  So all n all my experience was not too good.  I give two stars because the beer was very good."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Hollander on many occasions. They have a great beer selection, and great atmosphere. 
However, I am vegan, and their vegan options are incredibly lacking. When I asked for the vegan options, the waitress pointed me to the salad section. Not all vegans like salads. Actually, many don't like salads at all. When the waitress didn't know any other options for me, I asked her to see what the kitchen said. (I was really hoping for a sandwich)
Alas, she came back with the only other 'health food' thing on the menu. a Quinoa bowl... just as boring as a salad. 
For a Milwaukee/Madison restaurant, this is very disappointing. 
PLEASE get more vegan options."}
{"text":"I liked Cafe Hollander. They had an easy vibe, good beer, and a delicious veggie burger. The place is really large, so you shouldn't expect to wait for a table. I'm looking forward to sitting outside on their deck in the summer."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast around 8am (as soon as they opened) on a Friday morning after wanting to try this place for awhile. The building is absolutely stunning from the bar to the booths to the huge glass windows. Not a huge breakfast menu but everything sounded very unique and tasty! I had the chorizo breakfast mac which was delicious, and a decent sized portion so I got a box to take home. Service was a little \"meh\", our server was not the most attentive or friendly but polite enough. Overall I will definitely be back to try their beers and lunch/dinner fare."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice feel. When you walk in, there is a lot of space for lots of customers, several maitre-d' to seat you, and plenty of space for people to wait. It has the same sort of design as other chain restaurants like Applebee's or Houlihan's, but here the food is better.

Before I continue, my order: beignets, eggs Benedict with roasted potatoes side, and a cup of black coffee. The beignets were solid. Crunchy outside, not too oily, decently fluffy interior. You also get a chocolate and a citrus icing dipping sauce. The eggs Benedict were pretty normal. I would recommend pairing a salad with the Benedict instead of the potatoes, both because the hollandaise sauce is heavy enough and a salad would be a good counterpoint, and because I thought the potatoes could have been roasted/browned better. The coffee was good, nothing much to say about that.

Now when my eggs Benedict came, I was intrigued at how \"perky\" the eggs were. Usually poached eggs sag and flatten from their own weight, but these eggs stayed upright and taut. Tragically it was because the yolks were cooked through. I decided to bring this up to the waiter, just to point out as a public service that whoever made these should pay attention and not over-poach the eggs for other customers. Well these restaurant owners apologized profusely. The manager and chef both came and apologized, and they insisted that I leave with something gratis. Later on, they also asked me my opinion on how the beignets were (I said that they were excellent, and I thought the chocolate sauce works better than the citrus icing sauce). Overall, I am very appreciative of the effort, because I think it means that they're going to do their best to improve. They're new, so it's very important that they iron out the kinks so that they will be an establishment that stays rather than fades into oblivion."}
{"text":"Coming from an out-of-towner, I thought this place was great! Our service was very fast and friendly! I wish au could remember our servers name. It was something like Bryin I think. Anyway, he was so nice and helpful.

We went for brunch. My stomach wasn't feeling so hot so I skipped the Bloody Mary and went with coffee. I enjoyed it. It was very bold. My husband didn't care for it though.

We started with the beignets. I've never had one before, so I had nothing to compare it to. Wow!! They were delicious! They had a chocolate and a lemon icing to dip them in. So good!

For my main meal I had cinnamon streusel French toast with a side of bacon. Amazing! Oh and it had an orange marmalade butter that was really good. And large portions too. I thought the prices were very reasonable.

My husband had the porridge skillet. He said it was really good. I tasted it and it was like eating oatmeal and I'm not a fan of oatmeal!

I really don't get why people gave this place such bad reviews. Try it again if you didn't like it the first time because we loved it and will go back on our next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about this place.  The big issue I have with them is the restaurant is soooo loud.  We were seated upstairs and unsure if it was the acoustics up there or if this is an issue throughout the entire restaurant.  Once the waitress had to repeat something to me three times.  Part of this was due to her not being next to me and not speaking up.  At our table we found ourselves having to yell across the table.  We were there at 5:15 on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy at that time.

Next, our waitress, was good, but not great.  She dropped an entire class of water on the 13-year-old that was with us.  It broke when it hit the floor and fortunately he only got wet and wasn't hurt by any of the broken glass.  We're not sure by whom, but he was offered a brownie dessert for being a victim of the dropped water.  It didn't show up when we paid our bill and we inquired to whom we thought offered it to us, she said it wasn't her who offered but would still get it for us.  It never showed up and we left.

Everyone at our table seemed to like what they ordered but nothing was truly spectacular.  The restaurant itself was pretty cool.  Building was impressive to walk up to and the inside was interesting particularly with bicycles hanging from the ceiling.  But given the combination of those things that went wrong I'm not sure we'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"We have been to Cafe Hollander in tosa, so we had pretty high expectations which were overall met at the Hilldale location.

Cool decor and lots of tables made our wait time non-existent which was unexpected at 5:30 on a Saturday. Cheese curd appetizer was delicious and my husband was very impressed with the beer selection. My sister loved her Mac and cheese and my husband raved about his burger. My burger was about as good as a well done burger could be. They did initially serve my burger with pink, but were great about taking it back and re-making the order (fries and all!) when I explained being pregnant, I needed it well done.

We will come here again, probably more frequently once I can have those juicy delicious burgers again!"}
{"text":"So I finally decided to write a review because I've been here three times, and each time has been more disappointing than the last. I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and it's safe to say I won't be back. 

Despite their claims of being a scratch kitchen, I think the only things their scratching are their heads. The food is mediocre at best and the staff is equally uninspired. They are polite but it's more because they have to be or at least that's the impression I get. 

The food is bland, over-sized in portions. I feel bad I didn't go to the Great Dane."}
{"text":"Rather disappointed & here's why: once again the service was horribly spotty & slow.....a neat interior with hundreds & hundreds of beers available. I ordered a $12 cheeseburger that was meh....& uneventful. My friend ordered a small bowl of soup & 1/2 grilled cheese sandwich; our order took 50 minutes! In fact, ALL of the tables around us had NO food before them. ( see pictures) why the delay? The taste was adequate & not worthy of a $12 price tag for a so so burger, oh & they charge you extra for a side of watered down Ranch Dressing. 
Our server only brought one refill; now you see her, now you don't ! Two people, no appetizers or alcohol or dessert, $28. Save your money unless you're dying for a Belgian Beer.....which most people aren't."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new spots in Madison, and I've been able to visit a few times since their opening this past fall. First, the space itself is so inviting and open. I really enjoy all of the patio space, both on the ground and upper levels. 

The food is incredibly tasty, and can be quite messy. The Cafe Burger will continue to drip grease into your hands as you eat, though I bet it's why it is so delicious too! I subbed in sweet potato fries and they were also excellent. The extra dipping sauces (ex: Sriracha Ranch) aren't quite worth the extra $0.75/each but nice as an option.

Hollander has a more unique beer list than many restaurants in Madison, and the extensive menu of Bloody Mary's will be at the top of my agenda on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with my parents to celebrate Mothers Day, my folks and I are picky about food, ambiance and price. Everything at Cafe Hollander was great - the service, food and price. The service especially was fantastic! So much better than the Great Dane."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Cafe Hollander for dinner/drinks! Huge selection of beer, and a fun menu. I've eaten here a few times and have not been disappointed. Food can take a while, as they're usually busy."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollander is much like a Kardashian-it gets a lot of attention but underneath it's soulless. Based in Milwaukee, the restaurant group behind Hollander uses the same formulaic approach to its restaurants. Put up some faux kitchsy decor and serve average food and watch people line up."}
{"text":"I live close by, my friend and I decided to dine here one evening with our kiddos. My 2 and her 1. We were seated quickly, the wait was less than expected. We sat for 15 minutes prior to receiving our drink order. My martini had separated and appeared to have been partially spilled. My friends drink I believe hot coco with peppermint schnapps or something in it was cool. Our drinks came out promptly but not by our server (he seemed unavailable after taking the order). The food took around 40 minutes to come to the table. 
 My friend ordered the Crab and Brie Stuffed Salmon, it was a tiny piece of salmon sitting on a  block of Brie cheese larger than the salmon.  She said it tasted awful. The unstuffed salmon,  had 4 over cooked butter soaked disgusting Brussels sprouts next to it. I don't even recall there being polenta. 
  The Childrens Mac-n-cheese had an overpowering garlic flavor that upset my older child's tummy while the chicken tenders had two fried bread sticks with barely any chicken inside.I ordered the Flatiron Chicken, it was in a bowl with pasta and gravy even though there's no dish on the menu with gravy listed, or pasta. There was certainly no pesto.
  My meal was extremely disgusting. The server was no where in site to mentions the problems. I was unable to eat mine. I asked the host while he seated another table if he could grab the manager stating our server had disappeared for 40 minutes, he returned with the server. 
  We decided to ask for the bill and we waited another 20 minutes, gave our cards also waiting another 20 minutes. 
  The table next to us had 8 women drinking, eating no food, without water glasses, our serve was the same. It wasn't until they'd been drinking an hour and a half that two women received waters. 
  I would not recommend Cafe Hollander at Hilldale Mall. The food is inedible, and the service is disgraceful.  
  I don't enjoy buying food that would make anyone shudder, but the worst part is when one is paying for a service, the service should be provided. When we go to restaurants we expect to be cared for.

{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here with a large group after hearing a lot of good things about this place. Seating is spacious and definitely is good for large groups, with both expansive outdoor and indoor seating. It seems like mostly a brunch place, but we came for dinner. I tried the BBQ boar with sweet potato fries. I would say that I really enjoyed my food overall; the fries were delicious and the boar was unique, but it seemed extremely salty to me. Everything seemed decent in terms of taste and quality of food as well as portion size, but I felt like nothing wowed me, especially for the slightly steep prices for the type of food ($12-$20). 

Overall, I'll probably be back if I want to take a large group somewhere in Madison, as the food choices are varied and good for this purpose."}
{"text":"I just had to update my review. I went for brunch with Papa, Mama J, and Babe. It was Mama J's Belated B-day Brunch. Our waitress was exceptional, I ordered the Milwaukeean Bloody Mary (very good if you're a horsey lover like myself) and it said it came with Lakefront Fixed Gear, but when it came with the Witbier I complained ( I hate complaining I always feel like some kind of villainous raptor sinking it's voice claws into its prey) and they provided me with a fixed gear chaser at no extra cost. And even though it wasn't Mama J's actual B-day they still gave her a free dessert, NOW ain't that nice! The fries were much better, still not authentic frites, but really good french fries none-the-less. Also try the sriracha mayo, it's the tops! I had the cafe burger, a good third pound greasy cheese covered burger ( no complaints)."}
{"text":"After two visits for brunch, I remain disappointed. Despite a great design and inviting space, the meals have been subtandard compared to other local offerings at Bassett Street Brunch or Oliver's Public House (weekends).
The Hot Mess skillet was served tepid and covered with cheese whiz - like sauce. The Brew City Benedict involved a very dry muffin, mediocre sausage and a poor imitation of Hollandaise sauce. The potatoes are deep fried, not my cuppa."}
{"text":"Great new place with a lot of space! Ordered some apps-- goat cheese bruschetta and sweet potato fries. Both were awesome. Beer was good too. Good prices and portions, would definitely return."}
{"text":"Been two times now around brunch hours on the weekend.

Drinks: Too expensive, first of all. The bottle list and taps are 2 bucks over standard Wisconsin prices. A lot of the higher alcohol brews are 10oz pours, so be aware of that. The pricing makes sense for the location and the fact that they have so many beers on tap and in bottles to choose from. So, if price is not an issue for you, by all means go here as there is quite a number to choose from. I had a nice bloody mary here and my SO had a tasty irish coffee from them as well. 

Food: We had some smaller plates the first time that were unimpressive and overpriced. Second time I had a burger that was satisfying. I should have had the Chicken and Waffles. Yum. Everyone seemed please with their food.

Service: Nice people! Never had much of a wait even though it was quite busy. Food and drinks came out timely.

Atmosphere: I think they've done an excellent job with the design and overall look of the place, It's clean and bright and friendly. Family friendly as well.

Summary: Not bad. Too high priced for me to consider it very often. I'd rather take a stroll to the other side of the mall and have a beer and burger at the Great Dane."}
{"text":"Somewhat Dutch / Belgian themed but overall is Modern American food. Large portions with a giant menu covering everything from BBQ to Belgian frites to seafood boils and curries. I had one of their fancier burgers and it was very average.

Enormous interior, two stories, high ceilings - modern build out. The menu is enormous - my biggest pet peeve. Pretty much everything can be had: burgers, sandwiches, salads, Belgian frites, soups, seafood, curries, barbecue, Italian food, hot wings. 

Beer list was somewhat impressive with a good amount of Belgian imports on draft as well as local beers like New Glarus. Beers were in good shape and served in correct glassware.

I ordered the Buttery Brie Burger, $14, and it was very average. I didn't think the beef quality was that great and the sauces and cheese didn't make up for it.

Our server was very friendly and outgoing. However, the food took awhile to come out."}
{"text":"Hollander is new to the Madison dining scene and we were looking forward to giving it a try having been to the Hollander in Milwaukee. It was busy on a Thursday night but we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The kids meals offered fruit and veggies with the entree and fries for a reasonable price. My husband and I shared mussels and frites which were very good. The frites were a bit salty for my taste but my salt-living husband enjoyed them. The Hollander IPA was ok. Lots of different menu options to try on future visits! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, fast and efficient staff.  Many options for seating, large or small gatherings.  I love the different take on everyday favorites like the BLT - they add their own special flare. Beer and cider choices are plentiful.  Great gathering place before or after a Badger game - Football, Hockey, Soccer, Basketball, you name it. Entrance and greeting area is a little tight when customers are coming and going, and tap water tastes funny.  Other than that...thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"It's fine.  Not great, not terrible, but fine.  Actually the food is on the better side of average but the prices are well-above.  On our few visits we've found the service to be mediocre...a bit...aloof, I guess.  Good beer options."}
{"text":"OK well they have this awesome roasted vegetable sandwich whose name escapes me

The beer list is enormous, which is baloney. Just stock Trappist beers and bud light you nitwits

They are spot on with meat doneness so order your burger how you like"}
{"text":"All of the 2 and 3 star reviews below pretty much tell the story.  It's priced like Graze, but completely lacking in quality.  $15 burger that was really poorly prepared and completely unimpressive.  On the plus side, the beer was delicious and it's a really big and open space.  We'll probably wait a long time before giving it another shot."}
{"text":"First things first, this place is massive to the point of being impressive. It seems like it goes on forever and it kind of does. So walk around a little. Don't worry, someone will point you in the right direction if you wonder into the kitchen on accident (this did not happen to me, but I imagine it could).

Second thing, the food is yummy and interesting.

What I tried (for brunch):
Beignets- Every inch for these little donuts is covered in powdered sugar and comes with dipping sauces. Why yes, I would like to dip my deep fried sugar bread into more sugar. How did they know?!

Quinoa Skillet- Very flavorful with a ton of texture. It's extremely hearty even without any meat.

Stuffed Crepes- This may seem counter to human logic, but I felt they were a little over stuffed and a little too sweet. But, I think that probably is what they are going for, so mission accomplished! A+

This place definitely merits a return visit. I'll be back to check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I like this place and am happy that we finally got one in Madison! This is my second time and I cannot say anything negative about the presentation or taste of the food. The food has been great every single time but just be prepared for a little while until your food arrives. 
Their menu is very extensive and their are always wiling to help you especially if you have food allergies. Keep in mind the \"build your own sandwich\", they are willing to do that for you. I also love their soups and bread choices for sandwiches. I have yet to try out the salads but my friends have and they say it's great.

What I really like about this location are the different sections/rooms that they can divide this place into as well as their outdoor seating. It is great for a friday after work drink with either friends or colleagues. Centrally located within Hilldale mall."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last year. It's honestly hit or miss with service. 

Space/Location
The restaurant and bar are BIG. In the summer, the outdoor patio on the first floor and upstairs can hold a lot of people. Even though there may look like there is a lot of parking, there honestly isn't. I have parked on the Macy's side many times and don't mind the walk. I would recommend going on a weeknight or for lunch. Expect to wait for a while if you are planning to go with friends and family for brunch. 

Service
Bar service is great. They are attentive and the food comes rather quickly after you put in the order. Again service in the general dining area depends on the server. The past couple of times, it took a while to get our drinks. The food would come but not all at once. This time, it took a long time for our original server to come get our order after we asked for an extra minute. It was about 15 minutes. I timed it. We were dining with a friend who has dietary restrictions and she wanted to make sure to ask questions about ingredients. Our server seemed frustrated by all of the questions. Unfortunately the attitude continued. Example: \"can I get my potatoes unseasoned?\" \"It comes with the seasoning.\" \"Can we just do salt and pepper?\" \"There is salt and pepper on the table.\" Later a manager told us that the potatoes don't come with seasoning anymore. So inconsistent answers. The managers are excellent. We ended up being helped by a different server. She was very nice. It was just awkward that in the beginning or first server was all smiles with the other tables around us but when it came to our table she completed changed. 

Food
Mussels and fries are fantastic. I love their cheese curds. Highly recommend the following: quinoa bowl, short rib poutine, sconnie burger, grilled cheese that has bacon and tomato, avocado chicken wrap, Benedict,...yum. I personally always have a hard time picking what I want. They have anmentire gluten free menu too. 

Booze
Lots to choose from. Love their Berry mimosa. Checkout their extensive menu. Too many to pick from. I like how they have their descriptions. 

This is a place I'll go once in a while. It's not my first choice, but I'll go if i get invited ."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to venture out while my wife and two other children were out of town. I decided to throw her into the \"hipness\" that I had heard about Cafe Hollander. I thought \"Introduce her to some hipster food culture and she will forever thank me.\" We arrived on a Saturday morning around 11:45 and were immediately seated. 

One thing I noticed after sitting down was how great it was to have a perimeter table instead of one towards the inside or middle of the floor. I'm nowhere near a seat snob but it felt like those sitting in the middle kept looking around towards the outside of the restaurant wishing they had \"those\" tables. Just a tip - ask for a table on the perimeter of the seating area.  The outside seating was equally as impressive. 

I'll be honest. I was in the mood for a lunch menu. A hip, complete, impressive and solid lunch menu. What we got was a single sheet (albeit two sided) brunch menu. Food selections were DEFINITELY breakfast heavy. There were some burger and sandwich options but I kinda felt cheated. Not the super bad \"my best friend just hung out with my mortal enemy\" cheated but a \"the DVR didn't record the first 5 minutes\" cheated. The drink options looked really good (no alcohol for me although drinking and shopping with my daughter might have been fun). If you're looking to start the day with a Bloody I think you should definitely put Cafe Hollander on the list to try. The multiple Bloody Mary options would make any weekend morning drinker very happy. 

Service was good. Better than average. Definitely a positive \"service\" experience. There was a table of 12 in the dreaded middle near our table. They were getting stellar service as well. Cafe Hollander clearly practices what they preach in regards to customer service. 

We ordered and the food promptly arrived. It all looked very good good but I thought \"Is there more coming or is this it?\" Portions were way smaller than expected for the price. 

I ordered the Hot Mess Skillet. Extremely yummy especially coming from a guy looking for the above mentioned \"full lunch menu\". This is a home run breakfast/brunch menu item and it absolutely gets my \"damn this is yummy\" stamp of approval. The cheese sauce is fantastic! It also gets my \"this needs to be bigger\" stamp and my \"cmon - give me three eggs instead of two for the $13 price tag\" stamp. My daughter got the bacon avocado chicken wrap. Again the portions seemed small. The wrap was good (of course dad needed to make sure that it tasted ok) but could have used some more sauce. French fry portion was weak. Definitely weaker than what I would expect. Fries tasted great - maybe that is why I wanted more...

So, really good service and really good tasting food. Four stars because of the food quality, service and ambiance. I was pleasantly surprised to be seated so quickly. My daughter left saying \"that was really cool\" so Cafe Hollander can officially be called a spot for early teenage kids. She enjoyed her food, I enjoyed my food and I'm sure we'll be coming back to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I've ate here enough times now I feel comfortable writing a review. I was debating for a long time between three and four stars.. but decided on four solely because their mussels are so delicious. 

Every time I've came and had a beer at the bar or ate at a table, the service has been slightly off. Sometimes it'll take a long time to get noticed at the bar, asked if I want another drink, etc... and almost every time I eat, something about my food order is incorrect.  I never even make adjustments or substitutions to what I order off the menu because I am the opposite of a picky eater, and I like to try meals and recipes how the chef intends for them to be eaten/tasted. I worked in the service industry for years so I understand flukes and off days, but it's a little more common at this establishment than it should be. Things like upcharging me for sweet potato fries when I've ordered regular fries, not bringing extra napkins or a straw when asked, or forgetting eggs on my egg breakfast sandwich (hello obviously the main ingredient is missing?!). One time I ordered the fried Brussels sprouts app and it came out not even a minute later and it was soggy and on the low end of luke warm, with grease coating the bottom of the plate. I Definitely sent it back since it clearly had been sitting in the window forever & was promptly delivered once someone ordered it so it wouldn't go to waste, which was a bummer because I love Brussels sprouts so much, just not soaked in fryer oil under a heat lamp for 20+ minutes!

So back to why I gave it four stars. THE MUSSELS. HOLY MOLY. They are soooo good. You get a very generous portion and they are some of the meatiest and most scrumptious mussels I've literally ever had. I will eat them again and again. The spicy ones are sooo good, the sauces are on point! I also love their French fries and array of dipping sauces.. I'm definitely a sauce girl. Honestly all of their food that I've tried has been really good, I've just had a lot of issues getting it ordered and delivered to me normally and how it should be. 

I also am obsessed with their patio areas.. one of the best ambiance's for a patio in this area of town, hands down. 

All in all, I would recommend this place, but with caution. Don't expect the greatest service of your life and some parts of your order might get messed up."}
{"text":"For some reason, everybody I know loves coming here. It may be the ambience or it's one of the \"fancier\" places around the Hilldale area. However, I'm not impressed by this place. Their food is standard with really nothing that stood out to me the time I came here. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, it's just nothing special and for a place this popular, I would expect food that's much better. Overall, it's a good place for friends to gather but I probably would not come back if not for that purpose."}
{"text":"Yes...this is a chain. Some people are surprised when they find that out. I try to avoid large american chain restaurants. Like Applebee's, or Red Lobster. But if you're going to drag me to chain restaurant please take me here! People always suggest Great Dane as a meeting place since there is so much space. I'm soooo glad Cafe Hollander is in the area now to offer an alternative suggestion.

Their beer menu is just that an entire menu. I'm sure anyone can find something that they like here or at least something they are excited to try. 

The building is beautiful. In the summer they raise the windows/walls and its just a great open experience. 

Thanks to Cafe Hollander I am able to at least tolerate blood marys now. It's a drink that has taken me a long time to get a linking for. They have some really excellent ones! 

The brunch is pretty decent. Their french toast was decent but I'd probably pass and try a different item on their menu. Their chorizo scramble burrito is massive. The sauce on it is delicious The breakfast potatoes are just ok. The BELT & A is quite good and I found amazing as leftovers the next day. 

This is a great meeting place for people to have a beer and enjoy some tasty apps. They have several different flavors of mussels!

Thanks Cafe Hollander for changing up the Hilldale scene."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into Cafe Hollander on a Monday night around 9 PM after catching a sneak preview at Sundance. For my birthday I'd been gifted a City Tin so I had a $10 off coupon burning a hole in my purse and had never been to CH so it seemed like the perfect opportunity. 

We were seated quickly since there wasn't much of a crowd except for a handful of people watching the NCAA championship basketball game at the bar. The server took our drink order then was gone for...awhile. He came back with our drinks and we ordered the table bread (I had not eaten lunch or dinner because I'm terrible at life so I was super hungry) and put our entree orders in at the same time. 

The bread came out pretty quickly. Described as \"pull-apart fresh-baked buns\" I had expected something more along the lines of monkey bread, but it's just a cluster of rolls that they don't separate before serving. The tops were just shy of being burned and the rolls were on the dry side overall. I did like the chive butter and it was nicely presented, but I don't think I'll need to order them again. 

Our entrees came out in a reasonable time. My boyfriend got the Happy Cow Burger cooked medium and I got the Bacon Avocado Chicken wrap. Both of us got frites. 

His burger was bright red in the middle, just a tad more cooked through than rare. He is not picky, so he ate it, but it was nowhere near what he ordered in terms of doneness. 

My sandwich, on the other hand, was one of the best sandwiches I've had in awhile. Everything was fresh, the chicken and veggies were good quality, the seasoning and sauces all worked together - I loved it. It's not a fancy sandwich, or a blow you away with creativity sandwich, but it's the best execution of this general idea I've come across in years. I was less impressed with the frites - they were crunchy but didn't have a lot of flavor. I rarely put anything on my fries, but I found myself wishing I'd ordered a dipping sauce to liven them up. 

By the time we'd finished, it'd be awhile since our server had checked on us. After five minutes of sitting there with us looking around trying to spot him, he finally came by and asked if we wanted boxes. We did, and he left. And we waited. He came back with boxes and offered  a cup to take home the butter for the leftover rolls. He left. We waited. He came back and asked if we wanted him to run the check and get a cover for the butter cup. He left. We waited. And waited. And waited. He finally came back and we were able to sign, box up, and leave. All in all, it took 15-20 minutes from the time he asked if we wanted boxes to leaving. 

When I started writing this I had marked my review at four stars - as mentioned, I am in love with that sandwich, and our server was really nice and personable - something that seems to be the opposite of many reviewers' experience with staff. However, as I've reached the end I've realized there is a lot to be desired, especially since we were in on a slow night. A couple other things that stuck out - the table across from us sat without being cleared the entire time we were there and had been that way when we sat down, the host seemed slightly perturbed that we wanted a table for food when we came in, and it's unclear why our server barely checked on and took so long every time he disappeared. 

Will I come back? Yes, but I'll be prepared for it to be a drawn out process and not a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Had high hopes going here. Beer list is good. Ordered my burger medium well and was given raw meat. Might be nice in the summer with the windows open to sit and have a beer. Milwaukee one is better."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The atmosphere is kitschy...lots of bars signs on the ceiling in one room...interesting distractions everywhere.

They don't take reservations and can be busy, especially for brunch later in the day but 3 of us went just after 10am on a Sunday and got seated right away so it all depends.

They have a good menu.  I want to try everything!  The mac and cheeses is yummy...different cheeses than you usually see in Mac and cheese make this a nice variation on a classic comfort food.  And the cheddar chive biscuits in the brew city benedict...omg!  Plus the poached eggs were just right, slightly runny yokes.

I've never had a drink here, only the food...hmm I shall have to rectify that situation and post an updated review.

Parking is part of the overall Hilldale lots so there's plenty but not necessarily at the door.

I've also never used the restrooms, again, I'll update my review because I'm definitely going back here."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for lunch  and once for brunch. Food and service were excellent both times. Atmosphere is great and menu is wonderful. I had a difficult time deciding what to get, there were so many great sounding options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place handles things really well. Good food with both interesting and healthy options. Great beer selection, best belgians outside of Brasserie V. 

Design of the place is fantastic-- huge open ceilings, lots of light, and every square inch is designed to the T. I'm sure the upstairs porch area will be fantastic in the summer, and the bar is perfect for sports.

Overall, someplace I'll be heading to over the Great Dane for sure now."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I had the chopped chicken salad and it was awesome. My friend had chili and the grilled cheese, which was also amazing. I loved the atmosphere - such a unique gem. Good beers, too! A perfect lunch stop while spending an afternoon at Hilldale."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner for the first time. We ordered mussels and calamari to share.  When we received the mussels, only half of them were opened and the others were not opened fully.  They were slimy and appeared to be a little under cooked.  We informed our server and she took them back to get us a new one.  A few moments later, she came back with the same mussels.  The chef said \"They are open, so they are cooked.\"  Nope. If he/she would have looked more carefully, they would have noticed they were under cooked.  The server was excellent. She took them away and got a different dish, but the fact that the chef put his/her ego above customer satisfaction makes this a poor experience.  The appropriate thing to do would be to make a new dish. I will not likely go back there."}
{"text":"???ridiculously expensive for very bland taste but the environment is fairly good for cafe"}
{"text":"Highlights/Lowlights

1) Awesome beer and cider selection 
2) \"Bier Den\" perfect for drinks and apps
3) convenient location in the new part of Hilldale mall
4) gluten free beer and cider available 

We visited Cafe Hollander after work on a Friday night in November. We told the server that we were there for drinks and apps. This must be pretty normal at Cafe Hollander because they have a spot called the \"Bier Garden\", a causal little lounge area with TVs, for just this purpose! We were seated here right away. I think this is something unique to the MSN location as the Wauwatosa location does not have this area. The restaurant is HUGE and conveniently located in the new part of Hilldale mall. 

We were given full drink and food menus in this area and decided on the apple cider wings and cone of frites. The cone of frites comes with two dipping sauces of your choosing. Woo! All of the food menu options come with a recommended beer or cider pairing (cool!). The beer/cider menu is MASSIVE. There were probably close to ten gluten free beer/cider options. Our service was fine and quick, not overly friendly but this is a new place so I'm sure everyone is just learning! 

If you haven't been over to the new part of Hilldale Mall yet you should pop over and give Cafe Hollander a try!"}
{"text":"Great brunch experience. Mimosa and bloody were quite tasty. The wit beer chaser was even memorable. Eggs Benedict was very good. The Hollander potatoes are a great side. Service was excellent  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was really good with decent sized portions, I had an omelet and ended up taking half of it home.  I did have to ask my waiter specifically for my toast which wasn't brought out with the food, but they were really busy when I was there.  However, for being packed on a Sunday at noon, and after telling us it would be a 15 minute wait, it was only about 5-8 minutes before we were seated."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that I have to downgrade my previous review based upon my last couple experiences here. My most recent visit was with my husband and 2 college aged kids at 7:00 on a Saturday night and I was less than impressed.  We sat down right away and were happy that we didn't have to wait.  That was the best part of the experience.  The menu seems to have shrunk quite a bit and I didn't think the choices were that great.  When my husband tried to order a veggie burger, the waiter informed us that they were out of them, which was surprising since it seems like a pretty basic item.  I ordered the salmon with brie and crab and it was mediocre.  Fish seemed like it had been previously frozen - it was kind of dry - and I found 2 pieces of crab and I never tasted any brie.  The polenta cake it was served with was definitely something premade and deep-fried their and the taste was awful.  The other food at the table seemed ok...nothing special...although the fries looked good.  Our waiter was not particularly attentive...when I asked for more water, he came over with the pitcher and filled only my glass and nobody else's, even though theirs were only half full as well.  At one point he must have gone out an had a cigarette, because when he returned to give us the check he smelled very strongly of smoke, which really bothered me.  It seems like the food has gone way down hill and I am certainly not rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a Belgian place, where the national food is mussels and fries (moules et frites).

The frites seem to be a big thing at this place, but they are not done as they are in Belgium. They might be doing the deep frying twice at different temps that the Belgians made famous, but the fries are as thin as at McDonalds. The frites in Belgium or Holland are 1/2 inch thick. 

Why make a big deal about this? Because my frites were HARD. Not crispy, but hard. Like little sticks of wood. I didn't imagine fries could even get like that. I wonder if it's because they cut the potatoes so thin? My companion enjoyed hers, but I didn't try those. Maybe I got a bad batch?

Vegetarian items seem to be afterthoughts to the menu, not something that they're proud of. Just something to feed to token vegetarians. The veggie burgers made from quinoa were just mushy. 

The beer list is huge! That's a good thing, but the waitstaff are not familiar with it at all. They didn't have the beer that I ordered and the waiter was at a loss about what to do. A person seeming to be a manager offered a suggestion of a similar beer to try, in that it was a blonde Belgian, except it tasted completely different. Like she had memorized the product description but not tasted it. 

But enough of my bitching. The atmosphere was great. The menu is great. On a non-vegetarian day, I would go back and try bitterballen, a great Dutch/Flemish deep fried meaty fritter that you probably can't get anywhere else around here, even at the other Belgian restaurant.

I think you would have a good meal here, if you're not a beer enthusiast, vegetarian, or someone who knows a little bit about Belgian food. 

 But fuckin' A, their frites were so weird. Brasserie V is much better."}
{"text":"The new Cafe Hollander at Hilldale does not disappoint. If one is in the mood for casual gastropub fare with an excellent extensive drink menu tailored to individually complement each menu item, then you will want to give Hollander a try.

I've happened upon this location four times since their soft open, but since I've eaten at restaurants before, I thought it might be smart to try dinner after the rush (eg: 7pm) and brunch before the rush (before 9am). Turns out, my decision to do so left me without any of the complaints found in other reviews regarding wait times or staffing. The sprawling staff has been nothing but courteous and attentive, even when my visits included unusual requests for the toddlers in my party.

As this location harkens back to the original architecture of the Milwaukee location, it is a beautiful space to get quality comfort food for a decent price. The burgers are solid; the salads are hearty. Some innovative twists on classic fare, and plenty of creative options for vegetarians. Don't like the cheese curds? Ok. You probably weren't going to like them anyway, because every person I've met in Madison has a slightly different opinion of which globs of fried cheese are the best. C'est la vie.

Seeing comparisons to Brasserie V and Great Dane (or even Freiburg), I really can't see the similarities. Also, if you're one of ten people in town who might want a meal without a hundred big screen TVs in your face, Hollander can accommodate (though their little Bier Den would be a fine place to watch the Packers if so inclined).

To avoid appearing sycophantic, the mgmt probably do need to work on training and coordinating such a massive staff in such a large space. That said, I've only had pleasant experiences with team members, and don't think you can really judge a restaurant based on one person forgetting some silverware one night. 

This is another solid offering from the Lowlands Group, and a worthy additional to an impressive culinary landscape in Madison. 4 Stars because there is always room to improve."}
{"text":"My wife and I were shopping in the area and due to inclement weather decided to not travel across town so we gave Cafe Hollander another try.  They still have a great beer selection and the staff was friendly and outgoing.  I decided to give a burger another try and this time it was cooked to the correct temperature and was served warm.  The menu selection is limited and still won't be my go to burger place but felt it only fair to update my review to reflect my latest experience."}
{"text":"Very nice location. Look clean and new. 
But....we order 2lb mussels. Not good enough. Not that it was ban - just \"not good\". The bread that come with was dry hrs before we got it. 
I order grill chicken salad. Boooooring. The only \"compliment\" I have for this salad is its size: it's big. But - that it. I tried - really - but cannot have good words for it. My wife order beet salad. She says \"it was ok....\"

Not sure I'll come back. For sure not in the next few months"}
{"text":"This place is the besttttt. The food is fantastic and you should go there everyday. The staff is great and it very nice inside. The burgers, I give them a A+. Over all i give the whole place a A+!!!! LOVE IT SOOOO MUCHHHH!!!!"}
{"text":"As a former resident and denizen of Madison's west side, I have taken a certain amount of guilty pleasure in describing aspects of the area which could lead one to believe that \"checking one's soul at the door\" is an obligatory first step in getting the full experience as a restaurant patron.  While Cafe Hollander has enjoyed a well deserved reputation of success in Milwaukee, the Madison location has a number of issues which deserve to be addressed.  The bustling crowds would lead one to believe that something here must really be great.  How else can you explain the apparent zeal people have for sitting on a patio which faces a mall parking lot.  Then I remembered that here in Wisconsin, if you have a novel alcohol-related theme (in this case, Dutch beer), people will sit in a dusty attic crawl space if the concept is unique enough.  As most regular restaurant patrons will attest, it is the accumulation of details which add up to a positive experience, and this place is no exception.  To say the food is as overpriced as it is, pedestrian might be harsh, but not especially untrue.  My turkey burger had everything that was promised, but somehow the cumulative result seemed unilaterally forgettable.  The promising inclusion of sweet potato fries was met with disappointment, as the serving was essentially a \"tangled knot\", served up at just above room temperature.  The side salad had it's merit, but should have been served before the entree, which had a temperature which made me believe that it's wait time upon completion was longer than five minutes before being served.  Perhaps their heat lamp was actually a black light bulb that you used to purchase at the mall.  I requested some dijon mustard and upon presentation of the bill found that I was charged $.75 without any mention from the server.  That was a first around here for dijon mustard.  Regarding my earlier criticism about the food, the best I can surmise is that the window where food is put for pickup is at a central location and if a given server is covering too many tables, an issue with temperature is all but guaranteed.  For those who would like an upgraded experience at a more reasonable set of price points, I recommend the Hilldale Great Dane, which is just around the corner."}
{"text":"The service here has been great the two times we've been here, but the food is unfortunately very disappointing (not to mention pricey).  The only food item I would sort of recommend is the goat cheese bruschetta.  I have tried the Benelux salad and the shrimp po-boy.  Both were pretty forgettable.  My boyfriend's mac and cheese was literally pasta soaked in milk.  Barely edible.  

But, I would still go here for drinks because the service is great."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Hollander on several occasions and it's always the same. Whether lunch, brunch or dinner. The service is crap. The food not good and the prices high. Also it's always so packed which I can't understand. If in Madison save your money and time and go to Pasquals or The Great Dane."}
{"text":"The average rating is due to the lack of ambience. It's very loud, the tables are too small and close together. If you go request a booth in the bar. They also don't accept reservations so be prepared to wait on busy nights.

They have an excellent beer selection and  our server was very knowledgeable and helped us pick great beers.

The portions are very large. I had the soup and half grilled cheese special. You have your choice of soups and I picked the classic combo of tomato and grilled cheese. The tomato soup was very good and satisfying. The grilled cheese was larger than a half sandwich.  Grilled sour dough, gooey cheese and bacon done to perfection. 

My husband started with a cup of chorizo chili. Excellent choice. His bacon cheeseburger came medium rare as requested. The French fries were pretty average. 

They have an interesting menu and I'm looking forward to going again. We'll ask for a booth in the bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Crowded but welcoming. Text notification of your spot on the list is great.  Allows you to wander Hilldale vs. standing cramped against other patrons.  The beer selection is impressive and offers a large variance in price. Had we known what we wanted within the first 5 minutes, we would have been fine.  Service was spotty after initial contact. It took more that 15 minutes to get a PBR. In a can.

Frites and the accommodating sauces were good. The Sconnie Burger was good. Just not $14 good.

Long story short. If I were in the immediate area and there were a wait at the Dane bar, I'd stop in for a beer. A weak third star was shored up by the unique decor."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now for brunch and once for dinner. Everything we had was tasty and the brunch black rice bowl was especially enjoyable. The space is beautiful, comfortable, and a place id love to hang out over some beers. Can't wait to enjoy the summer weather with all their great operable windows, doors, and outdoor dining options in a couple of months! This is a great addition to the near west side."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but everything is pretty much fried. I don't know if it was a bad night or what but our dining experience was a circus of errors. We started with the cheese curds which to this Californian were mind-blowing! Holy crap, how come we don't have those in CA??? It's a probably a good thing we don't have them in CA or else I would be obese. 

The food was mediocre, they couldn't seem to get the food right for one of the members in my party and every time they tried to correct it, it still didn't come out right. 

I think they need to take a step back and really work on the things that make a restaurant great- high quality food, and excellent customer service. They were really trying with the customer service, but it just wasn't working Friday night. Keep it up Cafe Hollander, you have a lot of potential to be better than mediocre."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Cafe Hollander's food and have never had problems with it at any location. I've also never had a problem with service at any Milwaukee location, but the Madison location must still be figuring things out. I've been there three times. The first time, the waiter either was no where to be found for a long time, or lingered by the table giving obnoxious recommendations when all I wanted to do was be able to read the menu. But then the second time I went there I sat at the bar with friends and the bartender serving us was super weird. At one point he started starring at one of my friends and it was obvious, so she looked back at him. He then seemed to get offended and said loudly \"what?!\". She said nothing and looked away and he asked why she was looking at him. 
About a half hour later we asked for the bill and asked for separate checks. He said he didn't think they did separate checks (umm wtf are you even talking about), and then some other bartender came over to correct him. Then he walked over to us like we were going to pay, but hadn't given us a bill yet! My friend asked if he could tell us how much we each owed before he took our cards and he said \"sure let me go check\". I hope this guy isn't as weird to everyone else as he was to us!


Update: pretty sure my boyfriend and I both got food poisoning from the fish fry last night which is really disappointing because their fish fry actually tastes amazing. But being in the bathroom the rest of the night was not.

Update 2: I think I'm done with this cafe Hollander. Every time I go at least one thing is disappointing. Check out the picture of my drink, taken before I had any of it. Also, ice chunks in a martini. No thanks. Surprising that this drink made it past both the shitty bartender that made it and the waitress who brought it to me without anyone catching how bad it was."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and laid back, but the food was definitely lacking. We ordered the beignets, which included a chocolate sauce that tasted like Hershey's syrup.  The eggs Benedict was horrible- the poached eggs sat on thick, really soggy biscuits. I couldn't even eat them, which is a very rare occurrence."}
{"text":"Cheese curds were great and the mushroom burger with brie and garlic chive butter on it was sooooo good.. served with au jus. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent location and looks really nice for inside and outside dinning. But they tend to oversauced meals that they can be too sweat. A good variety of beer selections. Their breakfast menu are interred tiny but they can be heavy. A good place to meet friends"}
{"text":"Very cool place. We ate lunch and were seated right away. My food was okay.. That's why I gave only 4 stars. My brother loved his meal though. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I knew a weekend late lunch would be bad, so I called to ask to reserve a table. Told we don't do that, but suggested I download an app that would let me 'get in line' for a table, and to do that about 30 minutes before I was meeting my work group. I did, and despite repeated checking--including in the parking lot--the app insisted there was 'no wait time.' Imagine my dismay when I was told \"30 to 45 minutes.\" They were right: it was 45 minutes from my arrival before we were seated.

Also note that the acoustics are terrible. It was expected in entry/bar area, but continued in our seating area. They have piped in music to boot. It was very hard to hear people at my table, despite our sitting in a 'booth' style arrangement of six.
 
The staff seems far too inexperienced for this kind of a place. They appeared stressed from a typical crowd (not a Badger day or anything in particular) and I didn't notice many smiles or pleasantries. I thought once we were seated, things would improved, but it took maybe 10 minutes to get our glasses of water, 2 coffees and a latte. The latte arrived first, then the waitress brought the water (barely iced) and one coffee. Had to remind her of the other. We ordered. A late person joined us, ordered tea and a skillet. Reported the tea as strong--it comes loose-leaf, so there isn't a way to adjust the strength. 

Imagine our surprise when her skillet came out first. An awkward ten minutes later--in which we encouraged her to eat while warm--the rest of the food came out. When it was delivered, by an assortment of staff, the waitress asked if we needed 'anything else.' A much better time to ask that would have been in five minutes, not as we were sorting ourselves out, but whatever. She might have checked back once, refilled coffee once, and then on another trip, refilled water.

Food: ordered egg white omelet. It was delish, as were the potatoes, but I couldn't figure out what the giant lump in the middle of the omelet was. Turned out it was the cheese. Friends reported the quinoa skilled, the eggs Benedict and the Door County cherry waffle as good. 

Paying took another 20 minutes. Just disappointingly slow from start to finish. I don't think I'll be able to convince this particular group of friends to meet here again, nor would I want to."}
{"text":"In the heart of the real life equivalent to SodoSopa (South Park reference, naturally), Cafe Hollander stands firmly planted in Hilldale. Chic, new and noisy this family friendly venue offers you dozens upon dozens of beer options, mediocre service, and greasy food that will guarantee you'll be reaching for some Tums in no time. Noisy and bright, every journey here could be described as eventful and charming. 

Whatever you do. Do not. I repeat DO NOT get the chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the sunshine, or the al fresco experience, or perhaps just good quality grub and libations but we loved Cafe Hollander! On Sunday morning, we didn't be e a wait for a table on their patio. We were seated quickly and given plenty of time to scour the menu. There were so many bloody mary options!! I was not disappointed with the Milwaukeean :) We ordered the house made cheese curds and were not too thrilled with the heavy pretzel batter. Each of us were much happier with our brunch entree choices. The chorizo breakfast mac was delicious and isn't for the faint of heart. The hot mess skillet was a home run combination of meat, potatoes, eggs and cheese sauce. 
I am curious to know if the other locations are as good as the one Madison!"}
{"text":"I'm in love! Stopped on a Saturday for lunch. Awesome open bar/restaurant with two levels of seating, indoor and outdoor on both levels. Friendly staff. Service was a little slow but they were very busy.

Beer menu was awesome. One in our party of 4 had a bloody that she said was great. Food menu was just as awesome. There were so many items I wanted to try. I decided on the Brew City Benedict and did not regret it. I can't stop thinking about it! I'm in true food love!

We'll definitely be back and will probably hit up some of the MKE area locations."}
{"text":"Meh... That describes this place in a nutshell.

atmosphere is really cool. This will be a cool place to hang out in the summer with the roof top. 

Food is kinda blah. Small portions for the price. I have no problem paying for high quality food. This is not that. 

Drinks... EXPENSIVE.  Beer prices are very very steep. A standard IPA is $8. Anywhere else in Madison $5. 

Will I be back? Maybe but only if we are forced too."}
{"text":"This new Madison location is aesthetically awesome and the food is great. I am familiar with one of the locations in the Milwaukee area so the menu was not a mystery to me. One thing I love about this chain is their beer selection and their pairing tips on the menu. It was pretty busy when I went there on a weekend night, so a call-ahead or reservation may be in order if you have a small group or don't want to hang around the bar. I had the mushroom risotto on a whim (not a huge fan of mushrooms) and I will get it next time I go back. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"An Europen pub in USA and I liked it. Especially food and several beers. I wanna come summer time. Roof would be great then."}
{"text":"Another restaurant under the Lowlands Group LLC, it did not disappoint as a quaint and pleasant weekend brunch getaway.

Their Milwaukeean bloody mary is loaded with sconnie staples (bacon, olives, cheese curds), and is very refreshing for brunch. Similar to Cafe Batavia, their bloodies has the right hint of sourness.

I ordered the braised short rib poutine. It has great taste, and the poached eggs are point plus. The portion might seem small on their large plate, but you will be stuffed quicker that you thought. The only downfall is the soggy french fries. While sogginess is inherent in poutines, theirs is just extremely tender and does not hold their texture well. 

Special thank you to our server who made our brunch an enjoyable one, and allow us to move inside due to the hot weather."}
{"text":"Excellent experience and not just because some terrific young lady paid my bill and thanked me for my service in the military. So if you are reading this thank you again.
The Lox Toast was very good. Great flavor. I would order again."}
{"text":"I just visited this place this morning with my fiancé. First, we walk in and ask to sit outside. After being seated in the shade on a crisp September morning, we waited about ten minutes before we decided it was too chilly. So we went back inside to the front and asked for a seat in the sun. The hostess complied and gave us a better seat. So we sat there for another twenty minutes at least and absolutely no one served us. No one came out to tell us that they'd assist us shortly or anything. It wasn't even very busy, so there was no excuse whatsoever for them to waste our time. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Best kids meals in Madison. Great service, food rules too! My only beef is I don't like to drink beer out of the specialty glasses and if you want a certain beer you have to be prepared to drink it out of the appropriate glass. I'm just a crabby old lady, though. I know they do it for a reason, but the stick-in-the-mud in me would prefer a pint glass :)"}
{"text":"What a night. Two of our five orders were entered incorrectly and we waited an extra 10-15 minutes for them to be fixed, and our waiter didn't even apologize. Regardless of whose fault it is, please tell me your sorry about the wait! They didn't even acknowledge it, and the two men who brought out our food just tried to blame each other and it was really uncomfortable. At least my meal was fine. Other than that, my friend got the short rib bowl and it was dry and cold. Hollander really dropped the ball tonight."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Unique  and tasty menu items. Good coffee and an extensive selection of tap beers. Very good food.  Plenty of seating (indoor and outdoor), so generally not a long wait."}
{"text":"It appears several other Yelpers have had similar experiences, so as a quick summation, it was an unfortunate swing and a miss. Inattentive, unhappy waitress, misinformation, lack of silverware twice, brunch food was \"meh.\"

As a side note, parking is not great. If you're parked in the nearby ramp there is no option to leave a car overnight. Not a big deal for a brunch, but with several bars in the area this is concerning.

Full review:
Three of us stopped in for late brunch/lunch yesterday (Sunday of their week 3 open). Totally packed house with a forty minute wait time. Put in our name only to have the hostess tell us we could eat \"in the bar area\" if there was room.  Three tables in the bar area were open and cleaned, so we sat down. A few minutes later our waitress approached and informed us that wasn't accurate, that these tables were part of the wait. We felt bad for cutting in line until two other groups did the same thing. The waitress later brought the hostess into our area and somewhat obviously scolded her in front of the bar area.

We ordered drinks (the beer list and bloodys are not skimping, which is a pro).  They appeared rather quickly, as did the appetizer.  However, we had to ask to receive napkins and silverware which didn't appear until the appetizer had been out for several minutes.  After collecting the dishes and forks (a timely busser), the waitress also neglected to bring us new silverware with the meals.

The food was fine. Smaller portions for some, though seemingly not all. It wasn't anything I'd be really excited about, especially with Hubbard's, Brasserie, and Vintage all in the area. 

A slight additional annoyance is the ladies' room downstairs - no soap and a paper towel dispenser that literally had to be slammed in order to work (demonstrated by a staff member).

Still, as the Milwaukee location is so much more to liking, I'd be willing to chalk this up to a newly opened place working out the kinks. The ambiance is stunning and the beer list is stellar, so that alone is likely to get me back...pending we get a different server."}
{"text":"Really disappointing dinner. Two stars (instead of one) because the waiter was really attentive and quick with beverage refills and because it is a great atmosphere and we enjoyed the terrace (which was why we chose to come here for dinner).

I had Chopped Chicken Salad where nothing was chopped - not the lettuce, not the chicken (breast piece), not the sliced avocado and sliced hard-boiled egg ( just matchstick carrot and a bit of chopped tomato on the side) and completely drowning in a watery blue cheese dressing that swamped everything. I ate about half until I was left with a soggy pile of lettuce (did I mention not chopped) and a literal puddle of watery dressing. The chicken (not chopped) was fine but didn't taste of the advertised lime cilantro marinade (probably because coated with the \"dressing\") and the avocado (not chopped) was good. We also had the meatloaf which arrived with a thick coat of congealed looking gravy so heavy-handed with black pepper it overpower everything else (except maybe salt). Apparently more is more - and not in a good way - on the dinner menu. 

I had an excellent brunch shortly after they opened and a very good burger and frites for lunch a couple months ago. Surprised the dinner was SO sub-par. My advice - stick to the brunch and sandwich menus and always avoid the watery blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice. Our first experience, slow afternoon, was pretty good. Ok food, industrial decor, good location. Second time was on a Saturday night: neglectful to outright rude service. Meal: Ho hum. Overall, disappointing."}
{"text":"I've heard from others that this place has some great beer options on tap. So, I figured it was time to go and check them out. We went on Sunday around 1pm. We went to the bar and wanted to grab a couple of beer samplers (no food). Their serving is 4 beers per sampler. They only had enough beers options on tap to fill one sampler for us to share! this is Wisconsin. Get it together and order more kegs to have beer on tap! They give us this HUGE beer menu to look at- but every time we named a beer to include in our sampler, the bartender comes out with the same response \"we're all out of that one\". We finally had to ask what they DID have to offer. Not a great first impression. A couple arrives next to us right after our sampler is delivered and they had the same issue as us. The guy was pretty disgusted and said that he will not be back."}
{"text":"As always, great! Food, ambiance, and staff is always wonderful. I gave 4/5 stars due to a very minor but significant mishap. When I asked the waiter if one of the hot beverages on the menu had sugar he said \"no\" and it definitely did. Not a big deal but for a person that can't have sugar this might be an issue. I have no problem with someone saying \"I don't know\"; it's all about expectations. Aside from this, I will always stand by the quality of the food and drinks here!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews say the service here is far from desirable. May they have changed things up? I have had the opposite when I have been here. I will say I have only been twice and both were for brunch on Saturdays. Maybe Saturday morning is the day to go? Not sure, but I have never left with a bad taste in my mouth as other have. 

Both times I went for brunch they were very enjoyable. They have nice Bloody Mary and Mimosa menu with multiple options for both. I am not a huge Bloody Mary person but I had a sip of my fiances the last time we were here and damn was that a good Bloody. He had the Milwaukeean, I would highly recommend it to any Bloody fan. 

The first time I was here I had the quinoa bowl for brunch. It is very flavorful and has a nice red pepper tomato sauce on top. The sauce helped all the veggies and eggs come together without it being dried out. The second time I go the Avocado Cucumber. Basically it is a sandwich with chickpea spread, avocado, peppers, basil aioli and cucumbers. Sound like it might be a little bland but it had a lot of flavor. The chickpea spread was seasoned very well and paired very well with the basil aioli. 

I don't remember very much about the service the first time I went but I was with a very big group. It may have gotten lost in the shuffle. The second time our service was fantastic. Very attentive and on top of everything. 

I would like to try dinner here and hope it will be as enjoyable as my brunches here have been."}
{"text":"Went to cafe Hollander today with a large group for brunch. We got here at 10:45 and I just got my food at 12:45. Ok I get it we have a large group and it takes a lot of time to get the right table.  So let's talk about my food I ordered the Americana with eggs and potatoes with two sausage links the food was cold when I received it the eggs were ordered over easy and they were a little runny and had cooled from sitting. The potatoes were ok but nothing to get excited about. The sausage links were very bad nothing like I have ever had I sent them back. Overall very unhappy with my meal and service very unlikely with what I have experienced before at cafe Hollander before"}
{"text":"Super slow service and food showed up lukewarm and originally was the wrong food. Way overpriced. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great location and food, service is usually dependable, I've only had a few \"less than 4-5**\" service experiences. We love the outdoor seating in the spring and summer. I do think prices are a touch high, but I understand probably in line with the Hilldale location. The cinnamon French toast is to die for if you are looking for a sweet brunch treat. Their bloody Marys are great too, burgers are good, and I have had some delicious salads. We end up choosing café Hollander probably more than any other restaurant due to convenient location and variety on the menu. We think service at the bar is more consistent/friendly so we tend to eat there."}
{"text":"Living in Milwaukee, I've been to Cafe Hollander plenty of times so my review isn't about the food at their new location. 

I stopped in to check it out the other day because I know someone who works there and I have to say, the building is beautiful. Lots of funky wood, natural light and just overall a very impressive environment. They have the rooftop patio and the atrium type ceiling, this place will be great during the warmer months.

Even though I just popped in and didn't actually sit down to eat/drink, two employees approached me to ask if I needed anything. With them being brand new and busy, it was nice they took the time to ask me.

Based on my previous Cafe Hollander dining experiences, my favorites are:

-the cheese curds
-anything with salmon
-potato chip crusted fish fry 
-the salads"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I've never written a review for here, I've been here at least 10 times. Great beer list and ambiance! The open garage doors make for great outdoor seating. The chicken Cobb salad is always amazing with hooks cheese, however today I tried the cucumber avocado sandwich.  It did not disappoint, very flavorful and filling! I don't agree with the negative reviews, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Sweet atmosphere, quality food, and a wiiiiiiiide selection of beer from all over the world. A preferred date-night spot for sure, as the menu can add up quickly, but the fun and great dishes we've had here does more than enough to cover the cost"}
{"text":"Can't quite put my finger on why I won't give this place five stars. Maybe it's the atmosphere or the limited selection of breakfast and foods that I like. But I keep going back so they must be doing something right.  Great beer selections."}
{"text":"Their brunch is much better than their dinner. Their lowlander pancakes are incredibly delicious, and the group I was with all raved about their food for brunch/breakfast. Their dinner was good but nothing exceptional, especially for the price. They seat relatively fast for their crowd."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Madison. Cafe Hollander does a phenomenal job capturing the feel of Amsterdam - large open spaces, a tree inside, great outdoor seating, bikes hanging from the ceiling, and various beer logos on the wall. After visiting the Netherlands a few months ago, I was amazed with how well this restaurant recreates that magic. Overall, super impressed and this is why:

Things I liked/Menu Item Reviews:

- AWESOME and wide variety of food choices. If you like seafood, go for the mussels and frites. There are three ways they serve mussels and all sauces are equally delicious. Especially with a nice beer pairing, there is no better way to enjoy mussels in Madison.
- Great service. The waiters are always extremely friendly and efficient.
- Huge variety of beers on tap and drink choices. The drink menu is actually quite overwhelming, so I usually ask the waiter for their suggestion or blindly close my eyes and point. I have not been disappointed yet. For non-alcoholic drinks, their fresh-squeezed orange juice is delightfully refreshing as well. 
- Some of the best cheese curds in Madison, especially with the sriracha ranch dipping sauce. It comes in a small, metal, deep frying basket so you know they are crisp, greasy, and perfect.
- Crab and Brie Stuffed Salmon = as wonderful as it sounds, although a little heavy.
- Blackened Shrimp and Pear Salad = fantastic combination. Filling, but still tastes light and the pear is a great addition.
- Chicken and Cornbread Waffle = decent. The chicken was a little hard and dry, but the gravy helped make up for it. 
- BBQ Pork Pretzel Benedict = intense flavor! Great for if you can handle this for brunch and a very interesting twist on the classic Eggs Benedict. 
- Seafood Saute = satisfactory. Good ratio and flavor, but nothing that blew my mind.

On further evaluation of me making this list, I think I may have eaten here too many times...

Things I didn't like/could be improved:

- Super hard to get seating here and they don't do reservations for the most part. It's popular for a reason, but waiting an hour to get in sometimes isn't worth it.
- A little pricey, but that's also reasonable for ordering seafood items.
- Most of the food is pretty heavy. Either that, or I just keep ordering heavy items. Be prepared to leave some time afterwards for you to recover.

Overall, this is a place I love to return to again and again because I know I will always have a pleasant experience. The dinner menu is much better than the brunch menu in my opinion, and you don't feel as guilty about spending an hour afterwards digesting your food. Definitely a great place to spend a lazy Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great location, mediocre food.  Went there for a quick lunch and ordered the grilled cheese tomato soup combo.  The soup was really unappealing with big poorly sliced onion chunks and slimy pieces of black basil floating around. The grilled cheese arrived with the bread being over toasted and the cheese hardly melted.......really poor execution through and through. With so many other restaurants in the vicinity, I would be hard pressed to find a reason to return."}
{"text":"Great place to drink a variety of biers. The bier menu is huge I was disappointed that my chicken Asian salad was wilted- the lettuce tasted like it had been wet and in the fridge overnight. Our waiter treated us like we were college students not worthy of real customer service and that we were dropping $100- come here to drink !"}
{"text":"I've visited several of their other locations and always enjoyed it.  So, when I decided I wanted to have a brunch with some of my out of town guests the morning of my wedding, I wanted to come to this location, which is near where I live now.  

A friend and I made Sunday afternoon brunch plans to come and check out this location and then I could talk to the manager about setting something up. It started going downhill from the moment I arrived.  It was summer and their patio was open, and they have apparently multiple entrances.  I walk in, wait around, nobody seats me.  I'm still waiting for my friend, so after a bit of waiting for her or a hostess, I sit at the bar and order a drink.  There are two other customers in the whole bar area, and he had to see me come in and wait around and look confused.  I did say I was planning on eating because I asked whether I should pay for my drink now or wait and have it put on my bill at my table.  I paid for my drink, but he never told me where the hostess was.  Then I see it... a bunch of people were walking up to the other door, and there was a hostess there.  I make a beeline for there because now I was worried all the beautiful outdoor seating would be snatched up by these new people.  She does seat me at a table outdoors.  My friend arrives, and then we proceed to wait forever for a waitress.  We made several attempts to wave down a waitress before we finally get one's attention.  She hadn't come to us because she assumed another waitress was helping us because I had a drink.  From then on, we got decent service and as always the food was great.

She gave me the manager's business card because they don't do reservations, even for large groups.  (back to wedding brunch planning).  When I called he wasn't enthusiastic about accomodating me, and if he did, he wanted me to move up the reservation an hour.  I couldn't do that because that would conflict with my hair appointment, and I already had their earliest appointment.  

I ended up making reservations at The Great Dane, who were much more excited about working with me."}
{"text":"Caffe Hollander was a great brunch experience. We were seated promptly and had very friendly servers. The food on the menu was pretty basic for brunch options and a bit expensive. 

I ordered a fresh berry waffle. This waffle came with creme fraiche, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, maple syrup. The creme was a bit sweet, but it paired nicely with the entree.

I would reccomend this spot as a relaxing brunch restaurant to take your guests to visit."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  I live in the area and go to Hilldale, Metcalfe's or Target every other day.  I really wanted to adore, this place, but both experiences have been just above average.  I would say the drink selection and quality are 4-stars, though the prices are more Chicago than Madison.  The food on the other hand is a solid 3-stars.  I know what they are trying to go for, but the execution is lackluster.  Like others have been saying, the space is cool, the drinks are expensive, and the food is okay."}
{"text":"Tomato soup was fantastic, slow service, not so much. Ordered bread that never came, and only saw a server once."}
{"text":"Impressive space and contemporary menu makes Cafe Hollander a good call for a nice lunch or date night. It's definitely worth stopping in to experience the space and it's a sure sign that Hilldale is on the rise.

I only had the pleasure to stop by for a work lunch so I'm sure the daytime experience is uniquely different than spending an evening in the cavernous, open concept, two-story space that looks like a Bavarian pub had a love child with a hipster speakeasy. 

The salads and bruschetta were nicely dressed, great for a light lunch, the staff is friendly and don't hover, the ambiance was energetic but not frenetic. Again, this was at 12:45 in the afternoon so who knows how sound travels here on a Saturday night.

I'd come back just to compare and contrast the ambiance."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here the other morning and it was amazing. 

The prices are a little high, but you get a good portion size and they don't skimp on flavor. I got the breakfast sammy and my husband got the breakfast burrito without eggs. My sandwich was pretty perfect. The breakfast potatoes were delightful and perfectly seasoned. I will say it came with a dipping sauce for the sandwich, but it was pretty unnecessary and would have been complicated by the size and gooeyness of the sandwich. The sauce was tasty, just didn't need it. He enjoyed his burrito as well. 

Next time we go, we are absolutely trying the beignets. We got severe jealously when the table next to us ordered them. They looked and smelled divine. 

The outdoor seating was amazing, I recommend doing so if the weather permits."}
{"text":"Server never refilled our beverages during the entire meal. I ordered an omelette that came with a cheese I couldn't eat, so I asked for cheddar instead. When the bill came, I found out they charged me $2 extra for the cheese. Really? If I had known they'd charge me, I'd have just scrapped the cheese all together."}
{"text":"The look and design of the restaurant is amazing. It's surrounded by giant glass walls, which open up entirely during the summer. However, no matter how awesome a restaurant looks, the taste and quality of the food is what matters the most. The majority of the items on the menu are quite good, and their brunch never disappoints. However, I cannot overlook their cheese curds. They are very hit or miss. At their best they're just like any other Cheese curd, but half the time they are undercooked and cold. 

If you stay clear of the cheese curds they could be a 4/5. But the lack of consistency in quality brings them down to a 3/5."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place since we live near hilldale and I think the restaurants in this area are pretty good. The building itself was impressive as well. I first went here around the time it first opened and was impressed by the rather extensive drink menu. The beer options are really good here. The food was very mediocre. 

I came here on a different day about a month later and thought I'd give the food a second shot, but again same thing. Drink options great, food bad. The fries were cold and tasted as if they were under a heat lamp for a while. Service was also not very great. When I'm hungry and want a beer, I'd rather opt for Great Dane. Otherwise, I'll check out some of the other bars/restaurants in Madison. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Hollander a few times, and every time I get a slightly different experience whether it is consistency with their food or with the server. 

The most recent time I went, my friend and I went around 2:45 pm, and it was pretty slow when we came in. We waited about 10 or 15 minutes before our server came to get our drink and food order. Once she did get our order and everything, she was great. 

When it comes to food, I felt like the menu was slightly limited to me since I'm a vegetarian. To begin with, the bruschetta was excellent, and my mouth salivates every time I think of the flavors blending in together. The vedge, which is there veggie burger, was alright. I wish there was more flavor and an extra kick to it like other places I can buy burgers."}
{"text":"The positives: Go for brunch and order the chicken and waffles. Seriously. Do it! Do it! You will not be disappointed. Adding on a bloody won't hurt either - and there are a lot of bloody options. Decent menu. 

The negatives: Wait times are inaccurate. Bar staff is slow - you will wait a while for a drink. Often long wait times and very crowded on nights and weekends. 

I went in one day and was seated at a table, asked to be switched to another table and was told no. That table sat empty the entire time we were dining. Bad customer service move. The place wasn't very crowded. 

Overall: Worth a try - especially for brunch, but be prepared to wait.

EDIT: No longer have the Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"My first visit to Cafe Hollander was a mixed bag.  I popped in on a Monday night before seeing a show at Sundance.  I was seated right away, and although there were plenty of diners all around the staff said it wasn't busy so they must be packed at other times.

The menu looked great and there are a number of things I want to try.  I settled on a burger and asked about the cook time, as it was going to be a tight fit to make it to the show on time.  My waitress said 10-15 minutes, checked back in with me a couple of times to let me know where my order was in the queue, and my food arrived promptly 15 minutes later.  Unfortunately the rare burger I ordered came out medium well - far overcooked for my preference.  

A manager stopped by about a minute after my food arrived to see how things were and was incredibly gracious when I told him it was overcooked.  He offered to have it redone, and when I told him I didn't have enough time he asked if there was anything else I wanted.  I declined that as well (timing) and he apologized, then explained the situation to my server and discounted my bill 50%.  My server was also quite apologetic and I was quite impressed by the staff overall.

While the food didn't quite hold up on this visit, I'll be giving them another try."}
{"text":"Went for late breakfast (10:45) with a group and had perhaps the most mediocre plate of food I've had in the past five years. Server acknowledged that it was past their best breakfast window and was very nice to comp the meal, but that is what it was worth--nada."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a wonderful experience here for brunch. Even though the place was very busy on a Sunday morning for brunch, we were able to get seats almost immediately and our coffee, appetizers, and entrees came out in perfect timing.

The restaurant itself is quite unique with bicycles hanging from the ceiling of the second floor and a tree growing in the courtyard. It made for a pleasant atmosphere and there was a lot of great natural lighting from the skylights in the courtyard.

As far as the food, my fiance and I enjoyed everything tremendously. The beignets were served fresh with warm, gooey lemon and chocolate sauces. You could tell the blackberry jam on toast was made from real blackberries. By the time I got to my chicken and waffles, I was so full that I could barely take a bite. However, when I did, I was not disappointed. The sauce they put on top was made perfectly and the cornbread waffle was delicious. I just wish the chicken itself were a bit better as it was a bit chewy and overcooked.

I also liked how they added beers to each of their food items on the menu so you knew which one to pick.

I will definitely be coming here again for brunch or possibly dinner. Hopefully I'll get to sit on the second floor next time!"}
{"text":"I've visited the location out in Wauwatosa a number of times in the past and always found it to be good, but tonight some friends wanted to do dinner out and we decided to give the new Hilldale location a shot. We knew it was likely to be crowded so we moved out 6:30 plans up to 5:30. We arrived and checked in at ~5:33 and were told to expect about 40 minutes to an hour for 4 adults and 4 kids (all under 5). This seemed a little on the high side since multiple tables of 2-4 came in and were seated immediately and tables of 6 or even 7 were old 15 minutes. In the end we were seated after about 40 minutes which wasn't too terrible. Unfortunately we were seated at a table that would have fit 10 instead of a booth that would have fit us just fine and all the kids were in chairs that slightly too low for them. Not the worst thing in the world but a more experienced staff probably could have handled this all a little better. 

The food we ordered was a bit of a mixed bag. All the kids stuff was fine, and to be honest the portions and sides given to the kids is pretty nice, although possibly targeted a bit more at slightly older kids. Nothing to complain about there. My son had the pulled pork sliders and they're good but not great (lots of sweetness in the pork). Two of us had the blacked shrimp and pear salad which is EXCELLENT! We also shared a pound of Basque style mussels and frites (mussels great; frites surprisingly unexciting) and the bitterballen (very nice flavor, could have been cooked very slightly longer). Unfortunately my wife ordered the veggie burger and found it to be very disappointing. The flavor was bland and muddled and was not helped by the somewhat oily onion straws. On top if that the veggie burger came out about 3-4 minutes after all the other meals and the server mentioned something about someone being hit with a door on the way out or something like that... Okay, so did you have to replate? Was something dropped? Needless to say it didn't inspire confidence. 

The beer menu was very solid, although slightly less extensive than other locations I've visited. Also, the beers here are quite pricey, so know that going in (and the wine even MORE so). All total four adults and three kids with one drink each and a couple appetizers ran up to $180 including tax and tip. Not the most expensive meal in history, but far from a steal. The space itself is great and I really like the decor. It looks like it could be a really fun spot in the summer time wen those big windows are rolled up and the patio is hopping, but for now it was slightly overcrowded, a bit too long to wait, and just not quite unique, exciting, or affordable enough to rush back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and fun atmosphere. However, the food is very sub par for the price."}
{"text":"Recently a group of seven of us met for a brunch on a holiday.  I was the first to arrive and asked for tables near the open wall but inside (due to the cloudy sky).  The staff was great about putting tables together right were I was hoping.

Our server was very patient with our slowly arriving folks.  We started with the beigets, mimosas, coffee, and a bloody mary.

When our group fully arrived, we ordered.  We were thoroughly enjoying our conversations so we didn't notice any delays.  When the food did arrive only half our order came correctly.  Three of us were missing ours.  We were not in a rush so we patiently waited as the restaurant was busy.  Our server kept checking to see if the food came.  Coffee was timely refilled.  It did take a while for the three plates to come.  I enjoyed my traditional Benedict with a side salad.  I didn't hear any complaints from any of the others.

Several of us took containers home.  Our server and the manager were very apologetic about the missing orders and compensated our table accordingly.  We tipped well because we have all been in that server's shoes at one point. 

This restaurant continues to be a good choice when in the Hilldale area.  And I am pleased that the management  is very interested in good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love bloodies and they have a great assortment, all done well. Huge beer list to allow you to try new types. Food menu is awesome, love the meatloaf! Service is good. Ambiance is cool, if you can get outdoor seating on a nice night you won't want to leave. We've brought out young kids a few times as well, they like it as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Bartender was OUTSTANDING! Expansive and interesting Bloody Mary menu! Best in town of which I'm aware. Check out their review at lbespie.weebly.com"}
{"text":"On a cold and snowy night, we braved the slippery roads to check out this place.  Having spent a little time in the Netherlands and having hosted a number of Dutch students over the years, I have a fondness for the food and drink of the lowlands.  

Overall, I liked this place quite a bit and will visit again.  The atmosphere was very nice, and had both a modern and an old-world European vibe to it.  Even sitting next to the glass wall windows (which I think will be able to open in the summer), we were comfortable. Our server was friendly and attentive (although I was a bit surprised she didn't know what Grolsch was).  Our meals arrived almost in synch with the appetizer (the bitterballen, which were tasty but maybe slightly undercooked;  I will try the fries next time).  The rest of the food was great;  I had a kale salad with the spiced shrimp and my husband had the meatloaf.  

The beer selection was amazing.  So were the prices (very expensive), and the pours were small but in beautiful glassware.  I do appreciate being able to taste some of these brews in the U.S., although it would be nice for them to have a few less exotic beers at the same price point (and serving size) as those at the nearby Great Dane."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch last Saturday and met up with friends and their two children. Because we were going to the Badger game, we showed up about 11 a.m. and made sure we were able to get a table. The game was at 12:30 p.m. so we wanted to make sure we had time to meet up before heading downtown. We were seated right away.

First Impression - Huge, cool venue, love the decor, bright (lots of windows) and good location for the Hilldale area.

As we waited for our friends, I ordered the Milwaukeean Bloody Mary which  had horseradish-infused vodka, bloody mix, pickle, carrot, bacon, white cheddar curd & olives, and was served with Lakefront Fixed Gear on the side. Pretty good but priced at $9 and almost the cost of my meal. But, I had to try it and it was good. 

For food, I ordered the Brewcity Benedict - House-made cheddar and hop biscuit topped with house-recipe breakfast sausage patties, poached eggs and house-made hollandaise. Served with Hollander potatoes. It was okay. Not the greatest benedict I've ever ordered, but   maybe just needed a little more hollandaise. $10.95.

My fiancee ordered the Belt & A - Applewood smoked bacon, fried eggs, sliced tomato, avocado and green leaf lettuce on nine grain bread with basil aioli. Served with Hollander potatoes. $9.95. Nothing super exciting about this sandwich. It was okay. He devoured his meal (because he was starving as always) and then pretty much ate the rest of mine.

Service was okay but not the greatest. Our friends son has a peanut allergy, so they have to ask more detailed questions about how food is prepared to make sure everything's safe for him. This to me is completely understandable, and having worked in catering is something that comes up all of the time. Our waitress seemed kind of annoyed throughout the meal, didn't come off the friendliest, but maybe was having an off morning or just felt extremely busy with the brunch rush. They ended up finding something that would work and they were able to substitute out some of the sides.

I'd try it again. Maybe order something else off the menu or go during dinner."}
{"text":"Went to their Brookfield location today at 3:30 and service was slow.  I ordered a salad and asked to swap out the tomato on the salad with cucumber.  When my bill came I was charged a dollar to do that.  Paid the bill without saying anything but thought that was ridiculous.
They also aren't using about 15 tables on the second floor, I asked the server if we could move inside to one of the many open tables and was told, \"we aren't using those. They're only for private parties.\"
I said, \"oh, do you have a private party tonight.\"
She replied, \"No.
Ugh....ok???
I'll be in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to eat here a few weeks ago and had an unmemorable meal and wet experience. We came in and stood around for five minutes for a host to sit us at table on a Tuesday night. She apologized and then continued to seat us across from the door during a windy winter storm. We asked to move somewhere farther from the door and she seemed extremely annoyed, but she brought water and menus and told us our sever would be there shortly. 
We looked over the menu which is concise but seemed to have options for everyone. We ordered our food and then waited and waited and waited. Meanwhile I noticed that there was a large crack in my water glass that leaked water all over our table, my lap and my winter coat and purse. The busser helped dry the table and get me a new water because our waiter hadn't returned to refill the duration of our wait. The food finally came but was nothing special, the flavors were dull. 
This restaurant is new, so hopefully they're just working out some of the kinks, but I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been here twice unfortunately. I am not sure what the policy is regarding hiring the wait staff and hosts but both times we were there they were extremely unprofessional and rude at times. We ordered a beer and the waitress brought out the wrong one. We kindly asked for what we ordered and the waitress made it seem like we had done something wrong and was completely unapologetic. It took her at least 20 mins to come back and tell us that they were out of what we ordered and brought something else completely different that was lukewarm. She was so snobby that we didn't even want to \"bother\" her for anything else. Mind you it was not busy at all. Oddly a similar situation happened again the second time we went back. The food is okay not great and not worth how slow and rude the waitstaff is. One would think the hosts greeting you would be friendly but even they were rude and were too busy chatting with each other to help us or great us."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends after work. Like the atmosphere. Hostess and server were friendly and patient. Menu is large and varied. Tomato bisque was tasty although not much of a bisque. More like thin soup with chunks of onions and tomato. No crackers with soup. Brought bread when asked about this. Charged $1.50. My friend loved her risotto--not drowning in cheese. Drinks are expensive. Rum and coke $6. Crowding and cold temperature contributed to less than comfortable dining. Would not bring kids here--too expensive and few simple menu choices. Cheese curds for appetizer are $9."}
{"text":"My first time at cafe hollander and it was delicious! Had the fries and cheese curds for apps and then a bacon omelette. Really great service for serving a big group. Super cool interior. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Creative spin on bistro fare for lunch and dinner.

Brunch: The quinoa skillet is quite hearty, with roasted tomatoes, tomatoes quinoa, and eggs. Remove the eggs and it's vegan, and I think it's hard to find a savory hearty egg-free breakfast option in Madison (I did enjoy the eggs, though).  Frites are very reasonably priced and a wide selection of sauces.

As for dinner, the cheese curds were overdone and/or the oil was a little old (we ordered later in the night).  The sauce with dill was a good addition.  I heard that the salads were amazing, and they were right!  The rocket salad had a very interesting honey lavender dressing and good quality blue cheese, as well as large portions.

Service is attentive and very well organized, especially in light of the absolutely enormous space. The decor definitely has some inspiration from Colectivo Coffee's garage door windows, and there are several different areas in the restaurant so you feel a slightly different theme in each area but with a unified theme.  Free wifi, ask the host for a password.

A welcome addition to the Hilldale area."}
{"text":"They have a listful of beer selections. I went with the sampler (4 choices of beer for $12), and all of them were so good!
Also got the cheese curds and fries which goes well with the beer. 
The most thing I like about the place is their atmosphere. Among the top choices to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Went here based on our college son's and local friends recommending it.  Bought my son his first legal age 21 beer. 

Used Yelp to reserve our table for 6. Our GPS said we would arrive 6 minutes late. We called and they held our table. We were seated immediately upon arriving. Place was packed at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night despite pouring rain.

I had the Buttery Brie burger, medium rare. It arrived plenty pink and was fabulous. The cheese itself was unusual, and there were tons of shrooms. Yum. I substituted for the shaved brussel sprouts for $3.95. Both outstanding. Very interesting menu I will try again i. The future. Food a 5.

Atmosphere is standard you expect from  Friday's, Chammps, etc. Very good, prompt service. Waters refilled without asking. A 5."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times. Always great. Bartenders are super, attentive and friendly. The food is so much better than the brew pub in the mall, I will never go back to that place. This is fresh and made from scratch. Delish. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!! This is a very hipster, yet not out-of-touch restaurant! It caters to all! Service can be slow at time, but order the Frites to pass the time! They have a great assortment of dipping sauces. My personal favorites are the Sriracha Ranch and the Basil Aeoli. I had the Brisket Poutine, and it was definitely a highlight! The briskets were well-cooked and really tender!! Pro-Tip: DO NOT LET THE WAIT TIME PERSUADE YOU AWAY. 

Pro-Tip Update #2: I cannot emphasize enough the urgency and the importance of ordering the Buttery Brie! The Au Jus sauce that comes with it adds so much more flavor and juice to a burger that's already oozing. Finally, you can never go wrong with some add-on bacon."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside the Hilldale shopping center, the atmosphere of the space is spectacular, so it's no wonder it was extremely busy on a Tuesday evening with a ton of others are dining in for dinner. 

Even better is the option for brunch all day, so I got myself a bacon and cheddar omelet complete with a cup of grapefruit juice on the side. 

Since we were in a rush to catch a movie, we indicated to the waiter for check also immediately after receiving our food and I did feel rushed eating the food so I'll definitely have to come back and try some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"A better version of The Great Dane in pretty much every aspect. Great beer selection with a rotating, crowd-pleasing food menu. Now if only they'd open up locations downtown, in Fitchburg, the east side and Wausau..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit Cafe Hollander after seeing it was open, but was underwhelmed with both the food and service.

The space is the real highlight of this restaurant, being modern and sleek with ample outdoor space and quirky decorations (bikes on the ceiling!) and a vibrant open feel.

Cafe Hollander is associated with a few restaurants in Milwaukee and I've been to their Benelux restaurant in downtown Milwaukee, which I liked quite a bit. Unfortunately, Hollander Hilldale didn't stack up.

Hollander tries to pride itself on its beers because they have a large selection of Belgian beers, but they all seem similar and are marked up compared to similar restaurants. I struggled to find a beer that I found worth the price they wanted.

I really enjoy typical \"Belgian\" fare and thought the food would be better, but was pretty disappointed with my \"Vedge\" burger. The actual patty was pretty good, but the bun looked like it was store brand and at the bottom of the bag. The fries were also pretty tasteless and mooshy, nothing like other \"frites\" that I've had.

Combine lousy food and drink with a somewhat-absent waiter and you get 2 stars. The space is the best part of this place and I'll probably give it another try once it's warm outside."}
{"text":"If you ordered a \"Buttery Brie Burger\" what would you expect the butter to be like?  Melted, soaked into the bun, rich and satisfying, right?  Not at Cafe Hollander.  This burger came with a large thick circular pat of fridge-cold butter on top.  Do you want a mouthful of cold butter while you're trying to eat a hamburger?  I do not.  I didn't finish it.  The cheese, by the way, was not much warmer.  The burger itself was acceptable, nothing special.  Strangely, it came with a small tin cup of au jus.  Our server said it was for dipping.  How I was supposed to dip a hamburger into a cup the size of a shot glass wasn't made clear.  The fries came out warm, not hot, which was just depressing.

By the way, this burger cost $13.  And if you want sauce to dip your fries in, that's extra.

To sum up:  if you want a Belgian-style restaurant with burgers, sandwiches, french fries and beer, you can go to Brasserie V on Monroe Street, which is no more expensive and much, much better.  If you want to eat at Hilldale Mall, there are tons of much better places to eat:  Muramoto, Dumpling Haus, and Porta Alba would all be better choices.  Even if you're determined to eat a mediocre burger and watch sports on TV in Hilldale, you STILL have a better choice -- The Great Dane, which is cheaper and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and amazing menu. Had a spectacular salad on my first visit but will probably try something a little more naughty next time. Lots of temptations, and a great drink menu too. I think this place will be rocking in the summer, especially with the open floor plan and exposed upper level!"}
{"text":"Unacommodating wait staff and dry, bland food. 

Totally not worth whatever it is you're gonna pay for unless you only plan on eating the breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Hollander with a large group this past weekend. We knew it would be busy on a weekend but only had to wait about 30min. Everyone enjoyed their food and table service was good not great so I am going to leave it at 3. But bar service was dismal. If we didn't like food I would be rating a 2. It's just this place has been open for a while now, it's Saturday and you know you're gonna be swamped. You should have experienced, fast bartenders working. Not new people or people in training or if you do staff with other experienced staff. No one in our group was able to get a drink before our table was ready. And when we were helped finally the bartender seemed confused as to what we wanted and where to locate it in the bar. As we were texted our table was ready he proceeded to bring out 3 different beers to see if it was what the person in our group wanted. We just said forget about it because our table was ready. We also got a text for our table however there were also 2 other groups waiting for their tables as well, so not enough hosts and confusion as well.

I really enjoyed my meatloaf, would get it again but probably should be served with a salad or veggies, maybe fried onions on top. The meatloaf was slightly mushy but I like it like that. The potatoes also a soft texture so something else would've helped, gravy was delicious. I had a bite of my mom's veggie burger option, a pistachio burger it was also very tasty. Their burgers were a nice 1/2 pound, but a little skimpy on the fries. We also got 2 pounds of mussels to share, they were OK but for almost $20 would probably skip next time. Server was OK pretty fast if not just a little awkward but better then the bar service. Service is a 2 food is probably a 3 or 4, wish I could give this place more."}
{"text":"On the way back to Minneapolis, my friend and I want to get dinner and she recommended this place. This place is located in a shopping area. So there was plenty of parking which is always appreciated as a driver. Service was solid at time I visited. Nothing more to say.
The place gives a modern and rustic type of vibe.
For the food short rib poutine was great. This short rib poutine was amazing. I feel that cheese and the  meat breaking off easily. Make this dish so amazing! The beer section was scattered. It was awesome to see some New Glarus on tap. For my main dish, I ordered the clams. I got to try both of the clams preparations. I personally perfer the classic as it is simple to keep true to the shellfish flavor. 
This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"As a fan of the Northeast Milwaukee location, I was very happy to see this restaurant come to Madison.  They've done a great job with the location, layout, and look of it, everything about the appearance seems inviting, especially on these colder winter days.  The inside is also a treat, with an open feel and variety of booths, tables, and large bar to sit at.

My wife and I sat at the bar for our visit on a Sunday evening, and while it took awhile to get attended to once the bartender came around he was regularly checking up on us.  He was social and our dinners came out in a timely fashion, nothing bad about the service.

Speaking of food, I tried the Rustic House Jambalaya and my wife had the classic mussels with frites.  Both of us were very pleased when they arrived, the presentation of the dishes was great.  Her mussels were in a gigantic steam pot with a sliced loaf of bread on the side and a cone of fries with Sriracha Ranch.  I tried a little of each and was impressed.  The Jambalaya was equally tasty, the flavor was unique compared to almost every other Jambalaya I've had but I felt that they still captured the Cajun essence well.  It had Duck confit, Andouille sausage, shrimp, jasmine rice, okra, peppers, and their special sauce, all of which breathed well in the dish.

I was eyeing up the roasted vegetable & hummus wrap, but passed on it this time around.  Their burgers were always good at the Milwaukee location, and overall I was glad to see that the menu has a healthy variety to it.  I think this is a place that warrants several visits to get a true feel for what is best.  There's plenty to look at too, with a slew of decorations, TVs for sports games, and actually decent looking merchandise (t-shirts, hats, etc).

Prices were the one area I'd like to see improvement.  Most items clocked in the $13-20 range, and this seems like a much more hipster/casual environment than the prices allowed for.  It's a place I'd like to make a regular spot, but with the high bar of entry I doubt it will become a frequent staple.  We had two main dishes + 1 small side, a beer and a soda, and our total was over $50 after tip.

Looking forward to the next visit, and this is one worth checking out to warm you up in the colder months.  Their 2nd level outdoor patio also looks fantastic once the ice thaws. . ."}
{"text":"Wow Cafe Hollander!  This place is awesome! Great atmosphere. This place has THE best Veggie Burger I have ever had.  I eat veggie burgers everywhere.  People, come give this veggie burger a try.  The toppings on it are perfect too.  And then do your self a favor and order the mac and cheese!!! WOWWWWW so good!!! Also the bruschetta with goat cheese is an amazing too.  Go. Now. Go."}
{"text":"Great looking place, fun and busy atmosphere on a Friday night.  All doors/windows closed, so, a little loud.  We had bottled beers, good local/Wisconsin selection (didn't go for the Belgian beers).  We had the club sandwich and the chicken bacon avocado wrap, one with fries one with salad.  Club sandwich was really pretty good, not really a club sandwich though.  I'd order it again.  Great bread, lots of turkey, bacon, etc, just minus the traditional tomato/lettuce of a club sandwich.  Side Benelux salad was good.  Lightly dressed.  The wrap was very good, too lightly seasoned, but that's easily handled with a little salt and pepper.  Great quality chicken, good flavor instead of generic tasteless chicken like many places.  The fries were good not great (Brasserie V's are great), and my dining companion noted that she'd eaten at Cafe Hollander three times prior, and this was the first time she was served warm fries.  She liked them a lot better warm!"}
{"text":"Menu looks great, but after 14 minutes had to go to door hostess staff because no one has been to the table.   Not starting off well"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Loved the food and the atmosphere.  My girlfriend had one of best original egg sandwiches I've ever tasted.  It was served on a pretzel bun, with an egg, mountains of cheese and Black Forest ham.  It sounds simple, but the taste was superb.  

My only complaint would be the service.  Our server seemed very annoyed even though he only came to the table 4 times in an hour and half period.  I guess I would be annoyed to if I had to work on St. Patty's, but with that said, he didn't seem so annoyed when the pretty girl next to us smiled at him.  She of course received plenty of good service.

Otherwise, definitely had a good experience and we'll be going back for brunch very soon."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Average food and service. I always come here with high hopes, but my experience is always underwhelming. I've also had several experiences in the winter being sat in freezing cold rooms which makes for an uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the beet and arugula salad which was really good, but adding salmon made it great.  Our waiter Bryon provided great service and was very friendly.   Also like the way they text you so you don't have to sit in their lobby waiting for a table.

Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch to try the Café Hollander for the first time. While visually appealing, our dining experience fell short. 

We decided to split a sandwich and ordered the avocado BLT. We each ordered a cup of soup and a full order of the sweet potato frites. 

While waiting for our lunch, I had to ask twice for more hot water for my tea.  Our waitress was friendly but elusive. 

When our meal arrived, our sweet potato frites were luke-warm at best, the avocado was missing from our sandwich and my tomato bisque was chili.  And our elusive waitress was no where to be found. 

Another problem with the sandwich was the bread which was toasted to the point that it should come with a warning that your mouth will be scraped raw as you eat it.  Not sure of a solution to this problem; perhaps less toasting or a different bread option. 

My friend did report all of the issues we experienced and the manager did credit our bill the cost of the sandwich and soup which was above and beyond what they had to do. More frites were offered to us also but at that point we were full and not wanting more. 

I would give this restaurant another chance. The menu is impressive and it would be worth another trip."}
{"text":"The WORST! 50 minute wait for cold fries and hamburgers... cheese wasn't even melted... to top off $50 for three cold burgers service with attitude... sorry to bother ya dude I thought we were at a restaurant for food? if you're too cool to actually serve people find another line of employment"}
{"text":"Second time here. First was for dinner a month or two ago and the second time was today for brunch. Service was very friendly but extremely slow the second time - took 45 minutes to get our food. Not sure if it's staffing problems or what? Food was excellent though. Blueberry pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness Cafe Hollander joined the Madison restaurant family! I'm always grateful that Madison has so many delicious food options, but Cafe Hollander is now one of my newest favorites for causal food - picked it for my birthday lunch spot for that reason! It's nicely located on the backside of Hilldale Mall. Check out the menu for delicious food and drinks, but keep in mind that they're willing to \"make your own sandwich\" if you ask. I have a family member with serious food allergies and Cafe Hollander was kind enough to let us take a different food element from 5 different meals and put them together to create our own special plate. Plus the interior decorations, door seating, and huge retractable windows are a great addition! (For those looking for a more private setting in the restaurant, they have a side room (with trees in planters to bring the outdoors indoors) that they can divide off from the rest of the restaurant with giant glass doors. I saw a engagement party decorate that room quite nicely and enjoy their evening in there last week!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Café Hollander for lunch. We were greeted by several employees and seated immediately. Great food and great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Having been to the new Cafe Hollander about 5 times I think they have some of their initial kinks worked out for the most part.  Service still isn't speedy but their food is usually pretty good.  The biggest laugh is their beer pours though!  They claim it's how Belgium beer is served (the glass half full of foam) but come on, we're in Wisconsin, let's pour expensive beer so it at least fills the glass 3/4 of the way!"}
{"text":"Want to be waited on by a staff of people who are noticeably hungover, but still pumping out good food? Also, need to start your summer base tan? Cafe Hollander! The place stacks cafe dwellers on top of each other and sitting at the top gives you a great view of the Hilldale Target...if you know what I mean. 

Beware of wicker chair legs!"}
