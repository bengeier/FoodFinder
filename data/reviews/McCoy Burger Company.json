{"text":"Came here on a Groupon.  I like how they source their meat locally from Ontario. Turkey burger came with a mango chutney, avocado and a whole lot of other goodies.  It was juicy and delicious!  Best turkey burger that I have had! We also ordered the 2 by 2 and the 2 by 4 burger.  Again the burger was really juicy! I would come back again! I would rather eat here then get a burger at a restaurant."}
{"text":"LOCAL What differentiates them is their proud sourcing of Ontario beef and chicken and other ingredients.  It is plastered on the walls, and towns where they are sourced are mapped on a digital screen by the cash register.  They grind their burgers daily on-site without fillers.  They claim \"everything from our traceable beef to our artisanal, preservative-free bread to our lettuce and tomatoes\" is from Ontario, is non-processed and is not pre-cooked;  I think this might not be true of some of their condiments, but I get their point and appreciate their efforts.  I always squirm when meat is not processed in a refrigerated, federally-inspected facility (or at least I didn't see such an area through their open-concept kitchen), so I was glad their meat was still super juicy when cooked well-done (how it comes; this wasn't a request for doneness).  That being said, their kitchen is all stainless steel, so it can be kept clean more easily.  FOOD Burgers are extremely rich, but tasty.  It tasted like yummy Sunday roast fat rather than an average burger.  We had over a tablespoon of beef fat drippings pooled on the wrapper by the time we were done (not complaining --- save for I didn't have more bun to sop that wonderful goodness up). Smashed burgers pressed onto a griddle so they get a nice, crispy, brown surface.  My criticism is that the burger sesame seed bun turned to mush; they need one with a bit more structure to hold up better.     \"Crispy Chicken\" sandwich (no grilled chicken options), hot dog, or your choice of burger patty:  single 4oz/McCoy (Beef), Double McCoy (Beef), 4 oz Lamb, 5 oz Turkey, or Veggie.  Pick your own toppings (lettuce, tomato, etc) and wide array of condiments or choose from their \"Signature Burgers\" list where they do the work for you.  Add on charge for a few \"extras\":  gluten-free bun, bacon, peameal, mushrooms, sauteed onions, maple glazed onions, housemade crispy onions, or cheese.  Cheeses include cheddar, Swiss, havarti, Monterey jack, blue, smoked gorgonzola (I KNOW!  SO COOL), Feta, Goat or curds  $2.99 Fries are exceptional and generously portioned.  Thicker cut and seem to be made from scratch in house.  They are creamy inside and don't really need ketchup.  The best part is when some of the fries burst so some are crispy to balance the softer.  Or you can get sweet potato fries, onion rings, or poutine.  IF YOU HAVE TO ASK... ...then I guess you can't afford it???  Well, anyhoozers, thought it was odd that their 6-8 (I think?) different signature offerings for chicken sandwiches or burgers did not have prices next to them on the digital menu board.  Receipt let us know it was $6.99 for their chicken signature and $7.99 for a burger signature to give you an idea.   Self-serve soda Fountain has about 5-6 options.  I don't think they sell booze.  This is really NOT light fare, but it's worth the calorie splurge and 10-minute wait after ordering.  SEATING There might be seating for 15-20 people tops.  Not a great place for groups or parties over 4 because the tables can't be reconfigured too easily.  CHILDREN They don't cater to kids much, and I think maneuvering a stroller through the narrow restaurant would be hard.  Plus, mostly tall tables makes it hard to feed little ones from.  I see this as a teenager, college student, hipster kind of place or take-out for families that favour locally produced.  DECOR & TV Black and white with red decals gives it a cool, minimalist vibe.  And, YES, they have TV's so you won't miss your favorite sporting event.  WASHROOM & ACCESSIBILITY This is huge in my book in this neighborhood.  It is actually on ground level so it is accessible by those with disabilities.  There is a weird condiment stand island up by the cash register so it bottlenecks line ups, pick ups, and self-serve soda dispensing.  SIGNAGE & BUSINESS NAME It says REAL MCCOY out front, but only after seeing the logo inside and on their website did I realize their name is McCoy Burger Co ------ not to be confused with another business called Real McCoy Burgers and Pizza on Markham Rd in Scarborough.  Though they do have their original store on Simcoe St N in Oshawa."}
{"text":"I had a burger no bun, the toppings was. Other than the burger, it was so small I hardly knew there was any meat!  It was also very greasy. I paid over $7. For just a patty with a few condiments.  The place seemed clean, however I did not see the bathroom."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Quality ingredients and cooked to perfection! Cheese burger was awesome; tasty and juicy topped with fresh toppings. Sweet potato fries  were sooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Received some coupons for this place and thought I would give it a try.  Single burgers are small (4 oz), offered on white (only) innocuous buns, and biting into one (or two-I sized up), was the most greasy,crumbly, somewhat foul-tasting, ground beef eating experiences that I have had. The fries, while initially tasty (if overly salty), are also doused in oil and ultimately receive a failing grade as well, in my books.  Must have used a tree's worth of napkins during this meal.  Can't comment on the other menu items.  It would be redundant to talk about the sterile, cubby like, space, which would have been forgiven had the food been better (though the music playlist was good).  A big waste of money and substantial calories.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I are somewhat \"Burger & Fries experts\" and McCoy (on Yonge Street, North of Lawrence) is by far the best!!!! The burgers are sensational and the fries... real potatoes, fresh cut, DELICIOUS!! We are so glad this place opened... way better than Burger Priest or any other place around. And unlike BP there's enough room inside, comfortable seating and the place isn't monopolized by a big cash machine front and center because Burger Priest only take cash!! McCoy's is a \"normal\" business that accepts credit cards!! Oh and the prices are also way cheaper than other places. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"The 2x4 burger is one of the best burgers I've had in a while, and definitely one of the better burgers available in the city.  The beef was actually beefy and the four slices of cheese melded the whole thing together into one gigantic pile of beefy goodness. The beef had just enough crumble and just melted into my mouth. The burger is BIG.  I also got the poutine, but after eating the burger, I felt too full to finish it.   Will definitely return to try something else--- But maybe just the burger by itself with a nice ice cold Coke next time."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around 8:30pm  Pros: - Decently priced for the quality of food - Burgers taste good - Fast food ambiance   Cons: - Fries were ok - Service was slightly sub par."}
{"text":"Stopped in here by accident.  Across the streets place cash only and the atm was down.  Awesome that it was.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the burger juicy and fresh!  There are lots of toppings and sauces to choose from.    If nearby stop in for good food.  If you are with someone not wanting a burger tie them to the lamp post outside and ask them to wait!  The fries were pretty average.  Look forward to trying more of the menu items soon!  Ambience 7-10 for a burger joint Service 10-10 were helpful Experience 9-10"}
{"text":"This time, I had the double McCoy, the lamb burger, a side of sweet potato fries and a side of onion rings.  Double McCoy is basically the regular McCoy with two beef patties, but the meat tastes great so an extra $2.50 for the patty isn't too bad.  The lamb burger was amazing. Usually when I get lamb, a lot of places sort of dilute the gamey flavour of the lamb, and I'm left wondering what's the point of eating lamb. But this place keeps the flavour quite potent, which I enjoy very much. So if you like lamb, you may consider getting this one.  I also had a taste of the turkey burger, and it also tasted pretty good. Not too sure how turkey usually tastes though.  Their onion rings and sweet potato fries are nice and crispy, served hot out of the fryer.  Last time the poutine really disappointed me, but the other items are great. And the $5 $6 price point puts them at a good spot against other burger places.  They also had a 2 McCoys for $6 deal with the purchase of a drink, so that's something to consider."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers with high quality meat. Juicy and soft meat, not over cooked. Toppings were fresh. I'll definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Burger craving? Come here if you don't want to pay $15 for a gourmet burger. You can easily get a nice juicy bacon cheeseburger for just $8 plus tax. They also offer non-beef options such as vegan burgers and turkey burgers. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries and a swiss turkey melt burger. Both were fresh delicious, wasn't overly salty like some burger joints and the price was pretty reasonable. The only thing that led to our disappointment was the fries. Not your traditional potato cut fries, had no taste and was probably soaked in the oil a little too long. Add some salt or pepper if you order the fried. I think next time I will try their sweet potato fries instead!  Overall, decent burger joint and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and tried this place. I was so pleasantly surprised. We got the Signature Rock burger which was AMAZING. honestly, the best burger I have ever tried. I love my burgers, and this easily beats holy chuck, five guys, shake shack etc..  We also go the beer battered onion rings. You can actually taste the beer! Really good. My partner had the sweet potato fries. Crispy and delicious. They look like those frozen crimped McCain fries, but amazing taste. I don't think I have ever given 5 stars, but this place deserves it. Well done."}
{"text":"finally. a burger shop that doesnt make you feel like shit after gorging yourself. great beef !"}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon for $12 worth of $25 of food here which is a steal! We ordered two 2 by 4 burgers (2 patties & 4 cheeses for $10.79 each) and a poutine ($5.79).   The service was friendly and fast. The food was brought out to our table which I thought was a nice gesture considering how busy the establishment was (fairly busy).   The burger: Good quality and variety of toppings, patty was tasty but slightly under seasoned and I prefer a little crisp on my burgers (it was too soft), bun tasted like a BK whopper bun...Cheese was too much.. Should have gone with the two slice instead of four. It was a decent tasting burger overall.   The poutine: Good fries, savoury gravy and creamy cheese curds. Good portion size for $5! Was able to split between two people. I prefer fresh squeaky cheese curds, and these didnt quite hit that mark but still very good.   Overall: Wouldnt make that 20 minute subway ride back from downtown core but would eat here again if we passed by as the value is good.  The search for the best burger joint  in toronto continues..."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery.  Ordered through JustEat. ETA stated = 45-60 minutes, actual = 90 minutes.  Paid for and upgraded to brioche bun but given regular bun. Other burger was just a cold patty on a soggy bun with nothing else. Fries had potential but were cold too. No interest in finishing the meal and felt ripped off. Utterly disappointing.  As much as I'd like to support smaller businesses, they still need to earn it by giving you what you order and on time."}
{"text":"The beef patty is very juicy! Bacon was fresh and vegetable was even fresher.  They don't  have special ingredients though like burger priest. I used a coupon which essentially gave me halve price.  $6 tax in per  person for their most expensive burger and a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!!!!! Juicy and flavourful! Compared to other burger places near by, it's fairly priced! I've been there twice now and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the McCoy Burger, I also added an egg. That was absolutely delicious! I've never seen a burger so moist before! And the buns were so soft! It all wrapped up amazingly with the egg. I'm definitely coming back, next time I'll try the double burger! They also have a triple one and it's very affordable. Totally worth it. Have the burger with the fries :)"}
{"text":"Pros my husbands crazy messy dine in only burger he said was the best he's had in Toronto  Cons : I ordered the chicken burger, so over cooked it was basically rubber you couldn't even take a bite off of it it was so tough, I asked for a burger instead and repeated five times NO cheese please, after my husband had finished his meal (we barely get time to ourselves without our five month old and wanted to share our meal together) the burger was covered with cheese. I just yelled and walked out I was so upset, the manager was listening to the entire experience and was too busy showing his family and friends the new restaurant to even say sorry to me, ridiculous. Mop was behind the cash and filled with water, gross.  Overall extremely disappointed, never going back."}
{"text":"Burgers are my favourite food group and this place gives Burgers Priest a run for its money. Not quite as mind-blowing in my opinion, but still a worthy contender.  I ordered mine with monterey jack cheese and maple sauteed onions (plus all the standard veg). Hot damn! It was delicious. Though definitely greasier than the Priest. Mine was a takeout order and by the time I got it home the paper was full of greasy burger juice run-off. No matter...the thing was inhaled in mere minutes. And bonus points for great pickles!"}
{"text":"I got a buytopia for 50% off and I got a double beef burger, chicken burger with fries (upgraded to poutine fries) & drink combo. I been to many places in Toronto for burgers and McCoy's double beef burger ranks high on my top burgers in Toronto list. Beef patties were juicy and tasted like it was made with all beef with little fillers.  Also patties had a nice sear to the outside as well.  The chicken burger was not as good.  It had a nice crispy crust but the texture of the chicken was too firm. The poutine tasted good but had too much gravy and cheese curds were very stringy and weren't squeaky like the ones I've had in montreal.  I'd recommend to just stick with the beef burger and to avoid the spicy relish which I had to scrape off because it was too sour and over powered the taste of the beef patties.  The total with the buytopia included costed around $12.43.  Even without the buytopia I'd give it 4 stars for the double beef burger."}
{"text":"My family went here with a groupon I had purchased. It's a pretty small bland looking environment. My husband and kids did enjoy their burgers and fries quite a bit, and said the flavor was great. I had poutine which was average."}
{"text":"Ordered their 2 for $6 McCoy burgers;  with the stipulation that a drink has to be purchased.  I bought a bottle drink ($2.49) but the associate at the cashier charged me the  fountain drink price of $2.19 with an extra $0.99 substitute fee (a rip-off IMO)...or perhaps she made a mistake.  Any drink purchase should satisfy the stipulation.  I did not bother ask, it was 9:44 pm.  A McCoy burger is $4.99 on its own. $3.79 additional fee will make it a combo (fries and fountain drink).  Fries ($2.99) on its own was ok- crispy and tasty; their gravy at $0.99 was ok as well.    Burger was so-so."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a fantastic meal at McCoy Burger. My sons and I ordered the turkey burger (topped with Havarti and hot peppers), the bacon cheeseburger and the O'Chicken burger.  All were amazing.  We enjoy Burger's Priest and Hero burger too, but McCoy was truly the best that Yonge Street offers.  P.S. Enjoy a side of gravy with your fries...so good!"}
{"text":"The Short Version:  Fresh burger similar to Five Guys with lots of toppings to choose from. The fries were perfectly crispy and reminded me of Hero Burger's fries.  The Long Version: I had seen this place open recently but never bothered to go even though I love burgers. If I was in the area and wanted a burger, I'd normally go to Burger's Priest. I decided to try it tonight and was pleasantly surprised at the whole experience.   I paid ~$11 for a cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo with lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup and spicy relish on the burger. The burger patty was very juicy, tasted great, seemed fresh (and Canadian as their walls proudly proclaimed), and the toppings were great too (in particular the spicy relish). I really enjoyed the fries - they were crispy but still felt like the potato inside was nicely firm (plus you get a lot of them). Coke products to drink, unfortunately no Coke freestyle machine.   Overall it was a delicious meal for a price I felt was relatively cheap compared to the dozens of other casual premium burger places that are constantly opening."}
{"text":"Ordered poutine for a Second time since I loved it but this time it was freezing. Fries tasted frozen and cheese didn't melt :( also taste Was Off"}
{"text":"This will be one of my top list burger joints!!  Took a friend to Fresh Burger (16 and Leslie) last week and he recommended I should try this place.  Ordered the Double McCoy - about $7.50  It's 2 x 4oz patties, freshly cooked.. The beef flavour was amazing!! The meat juices were flowing, the burger was messy. Tasted high quality meats and I could tell there wasn't much filler added. Bun was not toasted but pretty fresh. If you check my list of reviews, I've been on a mission to find the best burger, this place definitely on the top of the list with exception to Fresh Burger.. I give this burger 4.5 stars rounding it up to a 5!  Also tried their Mediterranean Lamb Burger ($6.50). Burger was also very delicious!! The 4oz lamb Patty on its own was so-so.. But the flavour of the entire burger was just awesome.. Juicy and super messy.. The tezeki sauce was just dripping right out, feta crumble and eggplant was over flowing with flavour, the toppings and the sauce was the highlight of the lamb burger.  Bottle of pop was $2.50..  Definitely recommend you try this place if you're in the area!! It's super close to Burger Priest.. So maybe you can do a burger showdown"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all! You can safely skip this burger joint.   The sauce is the magical ingredient in a burger and their sauces are pretty much all meh   There are much more exciting options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 by 4 hamburger combo for lunch. The 2 by 4 hamburger is two patties and 4 slices of cheese. The hamburger fell apart while eating. I guess the hamburger was okay. Comparable to the burger priest and other gourmet hamburger restaurants. The French fries were typically frozen fries.  The service was kind of slow and the manager/owner looked annoyed and impatient.  Would I go back? Maybe, but there are many other hamburger places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was only a matter of time before I was going to check out McCoy Burger Company, because A) I love burgers and B) I bought a Groupon.  I went with the McCoy Burger and had it topped with ketchup, mustard, relish, tomatoes, onions, and pickles. I also upgraded to a combo and got onion rings and a bottle of water.  (As a sidenote: The bottles of water and pop are in a self-serve fridge and I grabbed a bottle from the bottom shelf. After opening it, I discovered that it was completely frozen. My dining companion rooted around in there but was unable to find an unfrozen bottle. Annoying.)  The food arrived a few minutes later and I dug in. It was clear as soon as I unwrapped my hamburger that the person who prepared it used a very, very heavy hand with the toppings. Honestly, I can't even tell you what the meat tasted like because it was so overwhelmed by the condiments.  The onion rings were average, at best. They didn't taste homemade, but rather as though they came directly out of a bag.  I can't imagine McCoy Burger Company will last much longer at this location, given that it's literally right across the street from the far, far superior Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"came here with a groupon.   Was not expecting much but was surprised at how good the burger was... greasy but thats the way i wanted my burger (not an everyday thing).  Portion was big.  Its a great deal, especially with burger priest up the street.  This is a steal.   The burger was stacked and tasted great.  Sweet potato fries were all fresh and crispy.  The food exceeded my expectations, however the service was lacking.   The girl in the front taking orders really seemed like she did not want to be there.. no enthusiasm and seemed generally annoyed.     Aside from that, im impressed and will likely return."}
{"text":"Summary: a very good burger place with decent price. Juicy, fresh, a lot of favours. My Favourite: beef burger, sweet potato fries, vegan burger Don't like that much: chicken burger, poutine  Went to this place with a group of friend using groupon. We made a trip to this burger place, but definitely worth it. Since it is a group of, so we basically tried every burger on the menu. I am not a burger fan, but I like the burger here. In my opinion, better than burger priest and In and Out burger in US. I ordered the vegan burger with almost every toppings and 3 condiments, sounds a bit crazy, but taste great. I tried my friend's beef burger. The beef burger tastes sweet and juicy. I like the sweet potato fries here. We got groupon, so the price we got is super cheap. However, the original price of this place is pretty decent. I would come here again if I want to have quick bite near Lawrence."}
{"text":"They changed their fries. Sad day. not as crispy   Just not the same. They knew they had amazing fries. Don't know why they would mess around. Hope they change it back."}
{"text":"Why are people comparing to burger priest? Not the same! I don't even like burgers really but just came here and now I'm back again. I found the patties were super fresh and had so many topping options! Poutine is good and the regular onion rings too. My fav is the deep fried jalepenos"}
{"text":"McCoy's makes their burgers using beef that is ground on-site daily, and this quality is made apparent once you bite into one of their juicy patties. The beef tastes fresh and has a melt-in-your-mouth texture to it-similar to the patties served at Burger's Priest (but less salty).  Another aspect that makes McCoy's unique is that they allow you to customize your burger with many different sauces and toppings. They have many basic burger staples which are free of charge (i.e. Ketchup, lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc), along with some fancier options that come with small charges (i.e. Sautéed onions, peameal bacon, havarti cheese, etc).  Overall, McCoy's is a good burger joint alternative to nearby rival chain Burgers Priest. Both use freshly ground beef which make their burgers taste similar. If you like the option to customize your burger, however, McCoy's might suit your fancy better =)"}
