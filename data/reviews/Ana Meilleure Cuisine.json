{"text":"Incredibly fresh and delicious Eastern European pastries: poppy-seed cakes, chocolate babkas, peach and cherry crumble, and other Croatian delicacies. Everything is made in the store, in an old fashioned stove.For the reviewers who complained about the owner's attitude - this place has a different vibe. Just come in with a smile and Ana will smile back and you'll get your share of these delicious baked goods - and - if you're lucky, she will even give you a piece of something new to try. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Danger!!! I was about to walk in and i thought the woman behind the counter said they were closed. A few seconds later, a couple walked in and she served them. I thought maybe I misunderstood her. My wife showed up and we walked in together. The older woman behind the counter said what would I you like to buy? I started to ask her what did she have with chocolate. She told me to get out or she would call the cops. She then proceeded to start smashing the mirror on the door in the back. The woman working here has mental issues. I would recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT give this lady your money. At first I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe she's just a bit socially awkward, that's why she doesn't seem too thrilled that we're looking at her \"display\" of pastries from the sidewalk. Then, maybe she was heading out for her lunch break, that why she's asking us if we're coming in to buy something. But now she's telling me I'm not allowed to have a camera on in her shop (which I didn't even realize it was on, because Lord knows I was not trying to take a pic of her little rinky dink place). I politely agreed and told her I didn't even know it was on. She cut me off and replied, \"there's no monkey business in here\" (after reading these comments, I wondering if that reply had something to do with my husband and I being black). She then failed to answer a simple question from my husband, cut him off and tried to rush him. He got snappy right back at her at this point. She asked me to place the money on the counter, did not hand me my change but placed it on the counter. We left extremely angry, saying outloud that we should not have paid her, we will not be going back there and these pastries better be made with bread from heaven after all that. We get a block away, I turn around to throw something in the trash and guess who is walking right behind me. That psycho lady. At this point I'm pissed, I stare her down, so she knows I see her, turn around to tell my husband she's following us, turn back around to confront her but before I could, she pretends to walk in the store and then turns around abruptly to walk the other way. This such a horrible experience to have in a new place on vacation. I wish I would have read these reviews before I stepped foot in that place and gave her my money. BEWARE. I don't know if she's just racist, crazy or both. And on top of everything, the pastries were hard as a rock, must have been sitting out for days, had to spit out the first bite and throw the rest away. But even if they were fresh, I would not recommend eating anything from there."}
{"text":"? Bigoted? Rude to everyone?  I will never know but there is something wrong with the owner here. 

When she saw me walking toward the shop she turned out the lights!  When I asked to buy a pastry she said she closes at 6:00.   When I pointed out it was 5:15 she said lights are out, I'm closed!!    THEN 20 minutes later when I walked past again, the lights were on again.  I tried to walk in and she blocked my way and said closed.... While she smoked a cigarette and talked on the phone.  

Really really bad customer service--- do you want to trust her with something you will eat?   I never would.  

STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"All the comments you've read are true. If I could select negative stars, I would! The cafe owner was extremely rude and nasty to my wife and I. We think she was mad at us (for some unknown reason) because she kept taking our picture as we were eating the dry and overpriced croissant we purchased from her cafe. Don't go here unless you want to feel uncomfortable and hated."}
{"text":"I think something is wrong with the owner of this bakery. I  was ogling the donuts in the window and went in to buy a chocolate croissant. First off, it wasn't a croissant. The owner yelled at me for \"standing near her window blocking the view\". I was literally there for maybe 3 seconds. The pastry was overpriced and stale."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY from this place! 

I walked in to the store hoping to buy a croissant. I was waiting in the line behind two other people to order. I was on my phone while the people in front finished paying. This made the owner angry and before I could say anything she yelled \"get out\". I was so shocked that I walked out immediately. She came after me saying \"if you want to be on your phone, get out! I will call the cops\"."}
{"text":"I came to purchase something for my children. I took out my phone to message my wife to see what they wanted and the worker started berating me. Worst customer experience ever. Donuts were okay. Not worth getting yelled at for."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews of this bakery are so sensationalistic and rude. 
The owner is a character, but where is the harm in that? She was very nice to me. I didn't know what to get, and she suggested a poppy seed roll. It was  delcious, fresh and large. The price was reasonable, especially considering the prime location and how hard it is to find really good Central and Eastern European bakery in Montreal (Cheskie's has more selection, of course).
Maybe the owner has reprimanded customers who take pictures because the end up in mocking reviews.
I would also venture that she is curt with some customers because she runs a business on her own and is not entirely comfortable in English or French. 
If you want to try European pastries, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"[The 1 Star is for customer service -- we were not granted the high honor of eating the pastries.]

The pastries looked delicious -- the poppy seed delights that lingered in the window drew our attention and, despite the fact that we were on our way to bagels, we thought that a pre-game pastry would be a smart tactic to tide us over. Instead, we were to be confronted with some of the most bizarre customer service we had ever encountered. 

The four of us (Canadians and New Yorkers) ventured in and deliberated over what to try. This did not seem like a ridiculous approach to pastry selection, but we were informed by the owner to hurry and stop wasting her time -- apparently she had things to do. (To provide some context, it was about 11 a.m. and there was absolutely nobody else in the store.) We thought this was a little brusque, but proceeded to select a poppy seed something or other that we could all share. \"One pastry for four of you? I'd rather not sell you anything!\" This sounded like a joke or perhaps some schtick akin to the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld and so, flabbergasted, we asked her, \"Are you serious?\" \"Yes -- get out\" she announced.

We emerged from the store in a state that can only be described as \"WTF?\". Let us recall the sequence of events:

1. We stopped to admire the pastries
2. The optimal pastry was deliberated upon for a minute
3. We were told to hurry up
4. A pastry was selected
5. One pastry was, evidently, the wrong answer
6. We were told to leave.

Look, two of us come from New York and so we are accustomed to foul behavior -- usually, however, it is a chronic state of ennui from Brooklyn-based baristas. However, to leave a pastry shop with all individuals visibly shaken and suffering from chronic post-traumatic pastry disorder is really a testament to some highly questionable customer service. Not all establishments are known for service with a smile, but few places kick you out for ordering the wrong number of pastries. We will never return and will probably not eat a poppy-based pastry for the next few months for fear of being reprimanded."}
{"text":"RUDE OWNER! Don't expect to get good reviews if you treat your customers like garbage! We are from Toronto and we've never been treated like this, ever. Still bought some pastries after she yelled at us (for looking at the donuts through the window wth?!) And I totally regret it because they were so stale! What a waste of money. These pastries are definitely not baked there. You're better off going to your local Timmies. The pastries will be better and at least you'll get decent customer service."}
{"text":"Humble little bakery with the most awesome chocolate croissants! Locally owned with a lot of heart. :)"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!!! NO ONE SHOULD BE TREATED HOW THE OWNER TREATS PEOPLE. 

The owner might be racist or a bigot or rude to everyone or just completely out of her mind. (Mind you I'm German and she was wearing a German hat so I don't really know what her deal is other than she's crazy.)

I was standing in front looking at pastries because you know... You put food in the window to attract customers... As I walk in she says \"we're closed\" I look at her confused as its 1pm and there's a ton of pasteries left (the store was completely empty lol). I say \"oh okay I was just looking to buy a pastry in the window\". She replies \"we don't waste people's time here, and I won't serve you, leave now!!!\" Still confused I'm standing by the door and simply say okay and start to head out... She yells LEAVE NOW! I walk out and take a call on the sidewalk away from the shop... She comes out from behind the counter and outside to tell me she will call the cops!!! I don't respond and simply ignore her, she goes back inside cursing and yelling? NO PLACE THAT TREATS THEIR CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS DESERVES ANY BUSINESS."}
{"text":"Good homemade pastries at a fair price. Not too sweet, just the perfect amount of ingredients."}
{"text":"wish we had read the reviews first... she was incredibly rude to me and my pregnant wife, who stopped in out of the pouring rain when we saw the delicious treats in the window. She seemed so annoyed as soon as we stepped in the door that we asked whether she was still open for business.... she said yes but was in a great hurry to get rid of us. As we were trying to find the change to pay her she said \"I have a business to run ... stop wasting my time.\" There was no one else in the shop and the shelves were full of pastries - perhaps she would sell more items if she were nicer to her customers?"}
{"text":"Batsh*t crazy lady runs the place... i wouldn't trust anything that comes out of there after talking with her."}
{"text":"$4.50 for one cinnamon roll and the damn thing was stale!  I had to fry it up in bacon grease just to make it edible!  Wtf!  I could have made a better cinnamon roll with stale Bisquick.

Don't waste your money here...."}
{"text":"The center of the show is Ana, she is an hard working lady that seems to devote her life to her shop.

I had a chocolate glazed donut and blueberries cake. They were both good...Nothing special, just good. The dough of the doughnut was really bread-y but it was huge!

She GAVE me the cake because it was yesterday's batch and it was pretty decent. She told me it is at it's peak when it's right out from the oven.

It makes me want to go back!"}
{"text":"She needs help.

I was talking on the phone and walked by her store and she ran after me with a broom."}
{"text":"After all the fuss I read about this place I had to give it a go.

I was greeted by Ana as soon as I walked in she was very happy to see us, we spoke loud and clear and didn't spend time asking 42 questions. I took the cheese pastry my friend the poppy seed. We did ask which was fresher and she said all of them... that wasn't the truth.

We got to talking turns out she knows my friends dad and she likes him. She did make some small talk about keeping in shape and how she gained weight working in the bakery. 

There was a older woman looking in the window pressed right up on the glass and to my surprise she didn't care at all and didn't say a thing.

3 stars because it was 8 dollars for 2 pastries and because they weren't very fresh. We gave our snacks away to a less fortunate person down the street because We didn't want to waste it and would never try to return it."}
{"text":"Pastries are industrial, quite stale, and overpriced. 
This place probably has the worst customer service in Montreal: the woman at the cash glared at us when we walked in, then curtly said \"5$ cash only\" when we asked how much the croissants were. Very cold and impolite. 

My advice: Walk a little bit more up St-Laurent and find better pastry shops."}
{"text":"Don't invest too much in the hopes and dreams of a bakery right here on Saint-Laurent, and you surely will not be disappointed. I was out in the rain, and happened upon a bunch of pastries in the windows, so I just popped in. I wasn't expecting anything special, and so I think that's why I had a nice enough experience. If you want an adorable French bakery on a street very near some iconic Montreal eats, teeming with Canadian charm and handcrafted goods... well... you've come to the wrong place.

What you'll find here is a simple retail spot to sell pastries and other foods to passers-by. I seem to recall the woman there being from Croatia (?) and being nice enough. I didn't ask about the origin of the baked goods, but she did mention that she thought they would be busier that day and if she had known that they wouldn't be so busy, she wouldn't have ordered as many pastries. That leads me to believe they're a retail spot with a good location, selling pastries and other baked goods in a convenient spot. Which, you know, I have no problem with if that's all they're claiming to be. I'll pay for convenience.

In this case, I did pay for convenience. I selected a chocolate croissant, which the lady there offered to warm for me. We made polite conversation and I can tell she's an opinionated one. But she was sassy with me (in a good way) and I liked the banter. A few minutes later I had a warm pastry on a cold day, and I was back out on the street to enjoy. Simple, and convenient."}
{"text":"Sorry she pretended I wasn't there and it felt wrong...zero stars!!"}
{"text":"The owner is NOT HONEST. This is one of the most terrible shop we went. The baguette is only one star and she over charged me because I seems to be a tourist with Asian-look friends. When we trying to ask for the true price, she pushed me out of the shop and closed and left her shop.
For the fact of doing business with honesty, I wouldn't recommend anybody to go there."}
{"text":"Wow. We went in her accidentally and totally regretted it. She said we looked mean (2 women in their 30s) and told us to put away phones and screamed at us that she would call the cops on us. She obviously has mental issues."}
{"text":"We went back the very next day, and I waited out on the street while my wife went in to try to buy poppyseed roll. Sure enough, the same woman who had been so angry the night before was warm, kind and courteous and sold my wife her pastry without incident. Bless this poor woman for whatever struggles she has faced and whatever is causing her such pain and turmoil."}
{"text":"This bakery is delicious. My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal and had just left Schwartz's deli. It was freezing cold and pouring buckets of rain as we were walking to the metro. I was desperately craving something sweet when we walked past this bakery.  

It doesn't have the most curb appeal, this place definitely doesn't look fancy, but I couldn't help but stop when I looked into the window and saw trays and trays of delectable treats. My boyfriend convinced me to pop inside where we met the owner. Yes, she is a character, but she was nothing but kind to us! Even giving us a free dessert to try that she had just baked! 

We decided on these chocolate buns (a combination of a cinnamon roll and a chocolate croissant I'm not sure what it's called), we waited to take a bite until we got back outside and the moment we did we stopped in our tracks! Her baked goods were like magic!!! We considered going back in and buying a dozen, and the entire metro home we regretted not going back. 

There are plenty of unpleasant reviews on here, but you must consider visiting this little hole in the wall. Whether the owner is grumpy or not this woman knows how to bake and you won't be able to stop dreaming about them! It's been months, and I'm home from my trip and I still dream of her desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Lady who runs this shop is crazy, like the other commentators mentioned. Was totally rude after we bought food and left, then ran after us and yelled at us again... don't go there :/"}
{"text":"I was in the area just passing by the store and saw some donuts that looked fresh and delicious on display in the window. I walked in, the person behind the counter probably the store owner, Ana, did not greet me. She was talking on her flip-phone speaking very loudly and obnoxiously. I walked towards the back of the store just glancing around the products she had on a couple of shelves, and she stopped talking on her call, and said- \"what do you want?\" I told her I wasn't sure yet and that I was just looking around. She replies- \"Looking? No looking! There's a sign, read sign, no looking on phone!!! That has been the rule forever here!\" I take that this was clearly a miscommunication. I was looking around the store, NOT on my phone. I'm not sure where she got the phone part from.

I debated on ordering and realized they didn't take card, which I made sure to ask her first. Ana again replied \"Read sign! Read sign and don't ask questions, don't waste my time. The flavors are outside, look and then order, don't have time to waste for you!!!!!\" 

Shortly thereafter, I just walked out of the store, and she continued to go back on her phone call. 
This was the most rudest, and terrible customer service experience I ever received. I was in the store for not more than 5 minutes max, and did not touch anything, and couldn't even believe what just happened in front of my eyes. I will never step foot in there again and hope someone gives her a true piece of their mind.  I also read, that she sells day-old donuts, very happy I didn't make a purchase. Montreal is a lovely city and I don't think Ana belongs there if she is NOT willing to welcome visitors. 

HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND (explains why not a single person was in her store during a busy weekend on St. Laurent Boulevard)! Would give this place negative stars if I could, minus not even having any of the food. The experience totally broke my visit to Montreal.


THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Contarary to other reviews, me and my friend had a great time! She was very nice to us, offered us poppy seed buns to taste because we were debating what to get. Had good conversations with us too as we sat there to doge the horrible rain! She even offered us coffee before we left. No complaints. We had the cinnamon bun, poppy seed bun and the chocolate crossaint. They were all delightful!"}
{"text":"The owner, Ana, an older Croatian woman, is unhinged. If you stand near the window, often she will come out and order you in. She arbitrarily names prices. Sometimes she makes paranoid or strange comments. She often kicks out anyone speaking in French, or will just kick out anyone for any reason whatsoever. She opens and closes the shop randomly, sometimes stays open at midnight...Yes, she is basically Montreal's Soup Nazi. Her behavior is erratic, at times rude and discriminatory. Other times quite pleasant; if you treat her with respect, she might have a conversation with you for 20 minutes or even offer you generous free samples (as she did my friend- incidentally, Asian- and I). She likely has some 'mental health issues' (maybe even schizophrenia). However, maybe we can look at this as a positive- as a kind of tourist attraction. Who knows what she'll do. Who knows whether you'll be able to buy any of the delicious pastries. \"No pastries for you!\" The expectation is a nonstop thrill-ride that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Incidentally, the pastries she makes herself (she makes a small batch on her own, and sources the rest from Cheskie's and other good bakeries) are out of this world, the most authentic and tastiest Eastern European pastries in Montreal. Poppy seed buns highly recommended. Gamble with fate to see if you can get any! - And when she prepares food, she does so mindfully, and portions are generous - Baked goods out front, and the rest of the space is devoted to imported products from the Balkan countries and hot sandwiches"}
{"text":"We were not even able to order what looked like a delicious desert...the woman behind the counter yelled at us for staring at the deserts for too long!  She threatened to call the police on us because we asked if they accepted credit cards. No joke. So rude couldn't even place an order. They are in the wrong business. Stay away."}
{"text":"I was visiting my daughter on assignment in Montreal. She took me and my wife to \"the best bakery ever\". 

The place is filled with all kinds of treats. I got the baklava. My wife got a fruit torte. Both were amazingly good.

The lady who owns the place was so nice. She offered my daughter a sample of a cinnamon cake.

I wished this place was near me in NYC. I think the locals don't realize how lucky they are that this place is so close.

I will stop off now very time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"This woman has a few screws missing.  She should not own a business that caters to the public.  She is abusive and rude.  She should be made accountable for her rude, abusive behavior.  Where is the Protecteur du Citoyen?"}
{"text":"The lady who runs this place is a nut case. She seems like she has severe mental issues. Its actually quite scarey. She seemed to have a friendly convo at first but then it turned sour super fast (probably because we couldnt follow her train of thought?) I was terrified! She ordered us out of the place and seemed to come out to check on where we went. What a psycho! This could have been a super cool place too. The pasties look delicious (and the one i got was yummy), but this woman needs to enter an asylum. We second guessed eating the pastry too, thinking she's that crazy to poison people. I would never go again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for stale pastries and unfriendly service. Experience so negative, it prompted me to leave my first ever Yelp review."}
{"text":"The owner must have some have mental problems. I came to buy some cinnamon rolls and saw that she sells some products from Europe I made a comment that she also had a small supermarket, all of a sudden she started yelling at me at saying that those were products from Europe (which I was not denying nor contesting) in an aggressive tone. I just walked off. I have bought a few things from her in the past and I find all the products overpriced and sometimes stale. I am done with her and her business, the customer service is as bad as can possibly be and I am not putting up with her crap, no matter how European she may be (I think she´s Croatian), she´s always rude and curt. I also have a European passport and that is no excuse for me to be rude. She´s not worth my business, nor my time."}
{"text":"Wow, I must say it is kind of a relief to hear that other people have had a similar experience with this crazy lady, I thought I was the only one! She is harassing, probably discriminating, and a negative influence on an otherwise lovely area that I call my home. People might make excuses for her by saying that she adds local color, but when a woman is verbally abusive and possibly physically abusive to her customers - making excuses for her is worse than negligence. If you wouldn't tolerate abuse at home or in the workplace, why tolerate it from shopkeepers who interact with tons of unsuspecting people every day? 

My encounter happened during the street festival when hundreds were walking on St. Laurent, who knows how many others she attacked? 

I was walking with my mother, who was on her last day on vacation in Montreal; she is in her sixties and has high blood pressure. We were looking at the pastries in the window because my mom loves to bake. The woman came out and yelled at us to get away from our store because she didn't approve of how we looked at a woman nearby (no idea what she was talking about). I followed her inside, trying to reason with her, since I just moved into the neighbourhood and want to have good relations with my neighbours. She kept yelling at me that she has what happened on camera, to get out of the store, and she was going to call the police. My mom came in visibly disturbed. Then the woman came out from behind her counter and started to physically push me out the door.  

Her eyes look in different directions, a sign of brain damage. She was making pastry while she was yelling at me. If she's schizophrenic/brain damaged, I seriously question her pastries. For your own safety: do not eat here. Do not go inside. She needs help."}
{"text":"We ordered a chocolate pastry. The owner told us it would be five dollars. We asked if we could also add a poppy seed pastry. She told us she had already asked if we wanted anything else and to get out of her store, that she wasn't selling us anything now and to go do business elsewhere. Psychopath. Never go here! If I could leave negative stars I would."}
{"text":"The owner operator is extremely rude and curt. I don't think I've ever felt as unwelcome as she made me feel. Frankly, the police should shut her down for her racist discriminatory behavior."}
{"text":"this place had insane babka, like the best i have ever had....so much good stuff and the woman behind the counter was super sweet."}
{"text":"I would give no star if I could.

Went there to buy some pastries with my grandma and the lady said I'll make sure to give you a fresh one because it's for your grandma...she admitted selling day old donuts.

Also bought a scone. When I gave my grandma the donut, she spit it out as it was too hard...same with the scone.

Her pastries are hard and not fresh...and how dare she sell it for $3 a hard as a rock donut?!?
Shame on her.

Please don't even go or support this establishment."}
{"text":"The people here who are saying that the storeowner has mental problems are neither being mean or inaccurate. My first two visits were pleasant and the pastries were good, although the lady seemed a bit eccentric. The third time, I came with a friend and my friend's phone rang as we were paying. The shopkeeper told us that no phones were allowed and I thought it was incase people take photos, which is understandable. My friend said okay and went out to take the call as I finished paying. However, the shopkeeper got angrier and yelled at my friend even as she was walking out. She yelled at me to tell my friend that the cops will arrest my friend for using a phone. She was so fixated on the phone issue in an abnormal way that it was so bizarre."}
{"text":"The lady that runs this place is batshit crazy.. our first encounter with her was before we even entered the place. She angrily muttered something to us on the corner of Roy and saint-Laurent. Having not grown up in Quebec my first language isn't French. There is a sign on the door (in French & English) which makes absolutely no sense lol. I had difficulty opening the door and the owner rudely said to me \"read the sign\" we walk into the place and then she told us to get out.../ Something about organized crime? I have no bloody idea. Unless you want to go for the \"experience\" I'd stay far far away from this place."}
{"text":"Tourists in town for McGill graduation. In her store for ~45 seconds at 9:30 AM. We were told that we \"should come back\" as we were taking too long to decide what we wanted and we were \"wasting her time\".  Life is waaaay too short for this kind of arrogance."}
{"text":"So from the looks of it, I am not the only one that has experienced the exact same rudeness as previous visitors. I've walked by this shop many times and there is always a display of big, tasty looking pastries, and bags of St-Viateur bagels if the Mile End is too far for you. This week though, I actually stopped in front of the shop to look to see what they had in-store that day since I was craving something sweet. I was barely at the window for 5 seconds when the lady working in the shop said something what I assumed was rude based on tone and facial expression, but I chose to ignore it and gave her the benefit of the doubt and the glass window in between us. However, a couple of hours after that, I thought I might get something; this time she was standing outside with her flip-phone, chatting with whomever, which is fine, it's been lovely weather, enjoy it. I walked passed her to see what she had in the shop, she immediately takes out this small sign and says to me \"no phones, no games in here\" - I assume she thought I was playing Pokemon-go but all I was doing was holding my phone like a clutch-purse and the screen wasn't even on. She asked \"What do you want?\" and I asked \"is this chocolate babka? How much is it?\" and in her continued rude-tone, she says \"$4.50.\" At this point, I was fed up. On two separate occasions on the same day, you were rude to me for no reason. I should have just taken a long walk to the Mile End to get chocolate babka from Cheskie Boulangerie where it's super fresh and there isn't a bunch of flies flying around the pastries. Don't waste your time coming here, the lady is really impolite and you can probably get better pastries a few doors down, that are cheaper, not worth the experience. If having phones in your shop upsets you that much, have a visible sign taped to your window. I've never had a bad experience in Montreal - thanks Ana Meilleure Cuisine for being the first in the last 5 years I've been living in the city"}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, homemade food. Her schnitzel and the potatoes salad are just amazing. Perfect food for picnic. Give Anna a call before you come and she will make fresh schnitzel just for you."}
{"text":"I don't often give my opinion on restaurants it has to be either amazing or super bad and have to share my experience in this little shop. I was standing in front of it the pastries looked great so I wanted to go by a chocolate croissant. I received a called and didn't want to step in. Find it really impolite to be on the phone and make an order. So I was on the side not blocking the door of course but having my eyes on the products to make my mind. Then the lady inside came out and asked me to move away because I was blocking future clients. I was shocked even the person on the phone with me find it rude. I said I'm far from the doors who am I bothering seriously. She insisted her mouth full of the orange she was eating. I said listen I was going to be a client and buy some products but you were disrespectful and you offered me such a bad service I'll NEVER come again. Avoid this place I've been working in guest service for years this place should shut down and that's it!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes, I shouldn't have read some other reviews, but now at least I get it a bit more, and if so many people are writing the same types of things, then hmm - perhaps. I'll just give my actual take. 

Whenever I pass by a place, and it stands out to me I usually take a photo to remember it for future reference. Was the case again, as I wasn't really hungry. I did get up close to the window, and when I saw the fresh looking, authentic look pastries I got a little more excited to come in. 

When I did come in, I was asked where I was from, and not to take photos and then that there were no phones allowed in the store, and to turn it off even though I did not see any signs that said that (I actually wanted to go back and mention that would be a good idea so patrons are aware clearly up front). When I was told I quickly moved towards the door to leave, even though at the same time she was offering me a poppy filled item. I was actually eye balling a large round tray of a blueberry topped treat on the stove top (probably pretty fresh and home baked). 

While at the same time being kind of shoo'd out, I managed to be served a square to take out of the what turned out to be very tasty apple blueberry cake. It was a little pricey at $4 tax in (and glad I had two twoonies handy) - but was a large portion and fresh for the first few hours.

I give the square, a three or even four, but the feeling in general was a little unsettling. Some other reviews are a little more extreme sounding. I do respect when someone does not want photos taken or posted to social media, so there will be none posted from me."}

Then she asks gruffly what do you want?! I asked her what the chocolate babka type cake was she says \"what does it look like it is?!\" She stood there and stared while drool ran down the side of her mouth right into the baked goods. We looked at each other and said actually we will go somewhere else. She yelled at us \"I don't need you, I have plenty of other customers!!\" The drool kept running down her mouth right into her baked good. Then she spit in our direction with much of it landing in the goods she was selling. This is unsanitary and sickening. Hopefully Canadians will band together and show true colors to get this place closed down. It is sickening to watch this women spit in her own food then sell it. She will be reported to the authorities for unsanitary conditions."}
{"text":"Prices are ok (4.50$ for a piece of cake -- plain enough I can make a whole one for 4.50$) but the cake was good: sweet but not enough to hurt your teeth, very fruity because the fruits inside are not dry (pretty fresh).

The owner is very friendly, giving us samples to try saying we could even get a refund if we didnt like (we already paid for the cake)."}
{"text":"I've heard many stories of the owner being racist and demanding anyone non-white to leave. Avoid to not support her, there are so many other great places!"}
{"text":"Why is this woman SO AWFUL? The reviews have already said it all, but I'm adding another just for hahas.  After I got berated for \"not remembering\" all the croissant flavors that she rattled off before I even got into her shop, I enjoyed 1/4 of a stale donut before throwing it out. 

TLDR: Awful. Don't go here if you're feeling fragile emotionally."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a croissant after seeing the baked goods displayed in the window. Only 2 other customers in the shop. The lady was very polite, chit chatted with us, and we were on our way after my husband had a donut and I ate half of the croissant. Delicious croissants, even after taking half to-go and eating it hours later."}
