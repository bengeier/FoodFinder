{"text":"The hotel is very clean, the staff is extremely friendly, the shower was awesome, the bed was comfortable (pillows are a bit too soft) and the overall experience was awesome. We didn't get to enjoy the bar/grill/pool due to our short stay but we will definitely be staying here again. I couldn't say enough great things about housekeeping - the honesty and integrity that was provided to us when I left behind a bracelet of great value (both cost and sentimental), restored my faith in humanity. I appreciated the quick response from housekeeping management when my call was returned and the compassion that was shown was unbelievable! I am so thankful that we got to experience this hotel and am proud to have this business so close to home. Great hotel!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent rooms, staff. Second stay here. New hotel about a year old. Rooms clean roomy. Has refrigerator and microwave. Hotel also has restaurant but menu mostly sandwiches in the bar. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. Will stay here again when in town."}
{"text":"Just arrived at the Four Points by Sheraton at Phoenix Mesa-Gateway Airport. The hotel is new, so everything is shiny and squeaky clean. The staff is very nice and helpful. Restaurant was delicious and the view of the golf course out the large windows is spectacular! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice clean place to stay."}
{"text":"We stayed for two nights and  will not stay there again for several reason. Windows cannot be opened, no breakfast is served and the green in back of the hotel is a golf course so you can only walk in the parking lot. Also they require a 24 hour notice to cancel a room reservation."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, rooms were very clean and cold which is a must in Arizona! Breakfast was good, staff was friendly no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Lobby looks really nice but many better options in the area.  Had to wait an HOUR for breakfast and then our keys didn't work. We understand that happens all of the time, but you shouldn't need to go to reception THREE TIMES to get keys to work to the TWO rooms you are paying to stay in for THREE NIGHTS.  Thank goodness a cleaning lady was nearby and let us in."}
{"text":"Booked a stay here for 2 nights as we were visiting family in the area.  We normally are picky and stay at 4 and 5 star hotels but this one was the closest in the area we were looking.  The hotel is new which is a plus.  We got 2 rooms because we got such a good deal; however, one of the rooms had a lingering \"dog\" smell (dogs are allowed here which is a bonus for some).  My kids didn't notice as they were stoked to have their own room but I was glad my room just smelled fresh.  Rooms were clean, bathrooms were nice.  I actually used the shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the shower and was pleasantly surprised.  Beds were ok, white duvet covers and feather pillows but there was some kind of square padding in the center that was shifted out of place by the second night and that was a bit uncomfortable but not that big of a deal (but worth mentioning).  Air conditioning in the room was very powerful, a must in the 110Â° plus weather.  The pool was on the small side but it was empty and refreshing.  Ate breakfast here, prices were decent and choices were good.  Had a few of the prickly pear margaritas from the bar, yum.  I would stay here again"}
{"text":"Computers in the lobby don't work. Staff says they are always slow. I stayed here because I needed a business center. This is ridiculous. Just got here and I'm already frustrated."}
{"text":"We ended up at this hotel because we booked through Priceline and only paid $79 per night. Pretty good deal, considering the actual rates are twice that much or more. When we got here we had a single room with a king bed but asked to move to a room with two beds since we had two kids with us. They moved us with no issue. When we got to the new room it was clear it hadn't truly been cleaned...the linens were fine but one garbage had a used tooth flosser in it and there was a razor cover on the floor in the bathroom. There were also no trash bags in either of the garbage cans in the room. We had them clean it after the first night and the razor cover is still on the floor. For the price that the rooms are normally I guess I would expect more than what we got. There is no continental breakfast and the breakfast they offer is extremely expensive ($9 oatmeal and $14 pancakes to name a couple of items, and coffee was $2.50). Dinner was more average priced and was decent (we got room service one of the nights). The staff that we encountered were nice and the hotel is pet friendly which is a plus for us. We did have people on the room next door complain about our dogs barking while we were at dinner but that could be because of the thin walls other people have mentioned in their reviews. Or it could be that they were jerks. There was no mini fridge or microwave in our room (again very strange for such an expensive hotel...these are things that are standard in hotels like super 8 and motel 6) but there was a coffee pot that brewed single cups of coffee at a time. One of the elevators was out of service for half our stay and the other one was extremely slow for a hotel only having 6 floors. There were only ice machines on the odd numbered floors. We have stayed at far nicer hotels than this one for less money and got more amenities for our money. I would never book this hotel by name but if I used Priceline again and only paid what I had I guess I wouldn't complain. If you have the choice...choose someplace else."}
{"text":"We went to Four Points last night for the Wednesday Happy Hour then had dinner.  The staff, Jason, Brittany, and Chris were all so pleasant and welcoming.  Chef Anthony Brown stopped by our table to tell us about the great burgers.  It's no joke!  The Four Points Burger is worth going for!  We will be back....soon!  

Classy hotel and beautiful \"Backyard\" Golf Course!  What could be better!  

Glad to see this hotel in the Gateway area of East Mesa!"}
{"text":"We had an early flight at the MESA airport and we decided to stay at this  property.
The front desk staff was very friendly.  Our room was  spotless clean and our bed was very comfortable.  We will stay there again next time we have an early flight."}
{"text":"We stayed here memorial day weekend.
They held $370.00 which wasn't a problem. The problem was 3 days after we left we were charged $175.00. When we called to find out why the front desk manager couldn't explain he gave us a number to the finance dept which never called us back after 2 attempts.

The room was fairly new and the staff was friendly.
We enjoyed the pool, I thought it was small for the size of the hotel.
The room service was very over priced. We ended up going to the gas station next door.
They have ice machines on the 3rd and 5th floors that was a inconvenience since we were on the 4th floor.
We probably would have been better off at a holiday inn!"}
{"text":"Great place that is out of the way. 

San Tan shopping is like 10 mins down the road. Not too bad. There is a chevron gas station on the corner. However, if you \"go green\"as in  not have the room cleaned one night they give you a $5 credit which we used for snacks. The snacks were reasonably priced for a hotel. 

Clean rooms.
Great shower water pressure.
Great body wash, shampoo dispensers. Nice, clean citrus scent.         They should sell some of these  products in the lobby. 
Microwave fridge and coffee in room plus plus. 
They have a bar in the lobby.
They serve breakfast and dinner. 
Nice firm bed with soft pillows. 

The only thing I wish they had was a jacuzzi hot tub by the pool. I'm not going to take a star off for that. It's the gamble you take when you bid blind on a deal. Stayed here two nights. 

Staff was friendly and all smiles at all times! Thank you staff."}
{"text":"Eh things are just ok.  the place is clean it's new so it should be clean.  Not impressed with the set up.  I checked In on Sunday it was 117 that day it urn on the ac and wouldn't go below 74.  The people there are friendly I was switched rooms here til wed.  Hopefully no other mishaps"}
{"text":"We were delighted with this hotel. I had contacted them directly and in doing so, discovered that they offer a special discount to AZ residents! We were in need of a hotel that had a shuttle to/from the Mesa Airport. They had a free shuttle and it only takes 5/10 minutes between the airport and hotel. We were also allowed to leave our car parked at the hotel at no additional charge!

Every employee we encountered from the desk, shuttle drivers and bar area were very pleasant! Drinks are a bit pricey ($12.50 for a Long Island iced tea) but we were treating ourselves, so we indulged!

The lobby had an overwhelming smell of men's cologne. I'm assuming it is an air freshener that they use because the smell was the same every day we were there. Our room was comfortable, although it smelled like stinky socks when we first walked in (fixed with a few sprays of some smelly good stuff from my luggage!) The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The room was clean and the linens were fresh! The television was nice and big.

The noise from a weed-wacker woke us up in the morning. But, those comfy beds didn't make it difficult to fall back to sleep! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The good: 
Front desk clerk was very friendly and the check in process was smooth. Lobby is nice and updated. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The internet was sufficiently fast and easy to access. The waitstaff in the restaurant were good.
The Southwestern Skillet meal was

The bad:
The ironing boards were to small.
The coffee in the restaurant was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is just blah. Serious cologne stench in the lobby, beds are horribly firm. Myself and my boyfriend woke up with major back aches. The air conditioning unit literally sounds like lawn mower. If your a light sleeper, don't turn on the AC...Outrageous room service prices. Also very loud! Our room was right next to the housekeeping, so we heard the doors slamming constantly. Also obnoxious guests early in the morning, which I understand the hotel can't necessarily control.   
A few positives: gentleman at the front desk was nice, free parking, nice pool."}
{"text":"Stayed at the new Four Points Sheraton for a night and had a good dinner at this hotel restaurant.  Quick service and chef Anthony walked out of the kitchen to ask us how are meal was."}
{"text":"New hotel. Clean. But whoever designed this hotel did a horrible job. 2 slow elevators and far too many rooms. Waiting 10 minutes for an elevator is not ok. Horrible. 6 stories is too many stairs. 

Kids running up and down the halls. Very loud. You can hear everything outside the windows too.   

Overly crowded in the common areas. Bad  design."}
{"text":"Great place to get some rest, the restaurant is not that great but is ran separately from the hotel. The hotel staff are very friendly, the room was clean and there's a coup free bottles of water in the rooms. Couldn't ask for more in a comfortable hotel stay. We have stayed here twice and both experiences were great."}
{"text":"Clean rooms, decent free wif, airport shuttle, and free parking...

3 stars for the crappy in room /house coffee.... otherwise it would have been 4 stars."}
{"text":"Well our experience here was a bit different from last time, which was truly stellar. 

Staff was very friendly, professional, etc., just as before. It started with their shuttle van which was 'not working'- so instead they rent individual taxis or Uber drivers. Here's a clue- when your shuttle van is being repaired, rent another van. 

Then, one of the elevators was not working. Could happen anywhere.  

Next was the restaurant that had undergone a 'menu change' and I dare say not good one. Last time we stayed here they had a filet mignon I would have put up against any steakhouse in Phoenix; now the best you'll get is a pan-fried pork chop plopped on top of some mashed potatoes. And only on Wednesday's. Lol. Very disappointing in that regard. 

So- 1) broken shuttle, 2) broken elevator, 3) blah food at restaurant.   Could all just be coincidences, but I wouldn't consider it the premium experience it once was."}
{"text":"Nice stopover while meeting my daughter from Tucson; room was excellent, clean and quiet. It was a short easy walk from Mesa airport, about a mile. Easy Lyft ride to shopping"}
{"text":"I only stayed here for a night, as I had a very early flight out the next morning, but I thought everything was great. It is on a golf course, so you have a nice view instead of just parking lots. The restaurant is full service and faces the golf course. I did not eat there, but when I looked in there, the food looked good. The room was very nice as well and very quiet. I did not hear anything and my room did face the parking lot. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and nice. 
The hotel is about 5 mins away from the airport they do have a shuttle.
My only tip is to book online. I was waiting for my flight to leave from Chicago and started looking and found the Sheraton for $70. When I landed and went to the hotel to book, the price was $99. The staff couldn't price match right there, but did suggest to book online using their computers which I did."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic hotel. From check in to check out, we had 0 issues. The rooms are nice and new, and the beds are awesome. They accommodated us with all our request, and even brought a microwave late at night for my niece to warm up here butter noodles. Definitely a great pick if you are in this area. 

Not a far drive from San Tan Village area where we live."}
{"text":"The bed had no pillow top so for this guest, too firm. Bathroom is tight but clean. Pool is smaller than pics and there is no whirlpool / jacuzzi. Although I asked for a room near the elevator, I had to return to inform them that a room at the end of the hall is not near the elevator.... Great location for golfers."}
{"text":"This was one of the best hotel experiences I have had in a while. Upon arrival the receptionist was upstairs meaning we would have to wait a few minutes before check in, which we didn't mind. However her co-worker was very apologetic and offered us 2 comped glasses of wine while we waited. 

The bed was super comfortable and everything was very clean. They definitely show attention to detail and care about the guest experience here

When I thought it couldn't get any better we went to breakfast the next morning and had eggs and bacon that were out of this world with a side of a golf course view. The view is a real treat in the morning while you're having your joe. 

Definitely would stay here again."}
{"text":"I am a platnium level member with this chain and had major issues with this particular hotel. They overcharged me nearly $2,000 on my credit card which they pushed through as something like 40-50 separate transactions and have refused to resolve the issue for over a year and I've been very patient. 

The steaks were cold for room service and our orders were not right many times.

Even though we had a do not disturb (make a green choice) sign on the door, they entered our room cleaned it and threw away important receipts as trash. 

While I was there I had a knee injury and was on the 5th floor. The kitchen apparently had issues and twice the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and I had to manage down the stairs with crutches in horrible pain (no staff anywhere to help even though I was in a disabled room with the roll in shower). I feel bad had that been a guy in a wheelchair at the top of the stairs sitting there. 

I was told by the assistant manager that at check out he would make sure to reverse some of the charges for the mistakes on the room service and for the trouble with the fire alarms. He was out sick apparently when they checked me out. 

The female manager was very rude and said I should consider myself lucky that my room charges were paid for and offered absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hotel in the Phoenix area. 
There is no additional charge for parking, of which there is plenty. 
When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the pleasant smell. I was greeted immediately. My room was ready with no issues whatsoever.
When staying for more than overnight, you are given an option to decline maid service and for every night that you do that they will give you a voucher that can be redeemed for either $5 at the restaurant or at the pantry OR you can redeem it for 250 Starwood/Marriott points. I use the points because they add up and upgrade your guest status. 
My room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I know that it is a dog friendly hotel, however If I didn't know I would never know. 
It was an all around very very good experience. I will stay here on my next visit. 
I highly recommend this hotel!"}
{"text":"Hotel is simply too new. Staff weren't aware of their own facilities. They have no onsite washers/dryers. They offered to do my laundry free in their own laundry, and then changed their mind and told me I'd be charged per item. 

The out gassing of new carpets, paint, fixtures etc is probably a reasonable health risk. 

The elevators are absurdly slow. The sound proofing is truly bad. 

There is nothing near the hotel. It's in the middle of nowhere. I'm sitting here wondering why the hell I booked this room. 

One redeeming upside was the Internet was decent, because the hotel was empty. 

Would never stay here again."}
{"text":"We chose this hotel as a great affordable SPG chain. It did not disappoint. We drove from California so we were quite tired upon arriving but check in was prompt. Luggage carts were available and the parking lot is right out front of the hotel.

Few interactions with the staff, but the front desk operator was friendly and helpful.

Would definitely return for another stay.   

PROS: Very fast check in, hotel is modern and sleek, very clean. The elevators are freezing which is nice considering the area is sweltering. The rooms are big and have great upscale features. Huge clean showers with tall faucets.

CONS: The entryway has a very strong cologne smell almost like a middle school boys locker room. It hits you when you walk in. As well the soaps and shampoos provided match the scent."}
{"text":"Thank you to Alexis, Bruce, & Patrick for saving me from being stuck in Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport.

They're the best in the hospitality business.

I really can't thank them enough.  They made my stay in the Phoenix valley extremely pleasant & enjoyable.

My appreciation to Alexis, Bruce, & Patrick."}
{"text":"Booked room and had emergency an hour later and they wouldn't refund.  Nice!!!   Avoid this place and will share this with everyone I do business with."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give it five stars is because they have a restaurant instead of free breakfast, but this is a personal preference and I knew this when I booked it so it isn't really the fault of the hotel. I booked through Hotwire and saved about $150 over published rates, so I couldn't complain. I've booked blindly on Hotwire and got burned, this time I knew what I getting. Hotwire booked it as hotel chooses room, and we had three of us, they gave us a room with one King Bed, and I didn't ask when we checked in. After going up to the room and realizing we had a been given a room with one King bed, we went back to the front desk, they were super accommodating and switched rooms for us with one with two full beds. The rooms were immaculate, overall the hotel was nice and new, and the morning staff was just as friendly. Great job."}
{"text":"I stayed her for three nights for a girls weekend. My aunt was flying out of Mesa Gateway, so we decided to stay close to the airport. Got this hotel through the Hotwire express deal. Yes, it was about a 25 minute drive from Tempe and Scottsdale, but there was a lot of shopping nearby. We didn't feel inconvenienced by the drive into Scottsdale when we had stuff to do there. It was an easy drive. 

TEN STARs for customer service- we were so impressed with the entire staff from housekeeping to front desk to restaurant staff. Anytime we asked for anything we received a yes! 

Yes, the lobby does smell like cologne, but it didn't really bother us, we didn't hang out in the lobby anyways. Myself and my aunt have allergies and it didn't set us off at all during our stay. Yes, the AC was loud, but I guess I'm used to that in hotels? 

The beds were comfy with plenty of pillows. Appreciated the modern features such as outlet box on the night stand with outlets and USB ports. Extra hooks for things in the bathroom and the built in shampoo and conditioner were nice. Loved the sustainability factor of the room, with the keycard electricity system. We also took advantage of the no housekeeping service deal and enjoyed the two $5 coupons we earned from it in the hotel restaurant. When we ran into housekeeping in the mornings we simply asked them for anything we needed. The front desk was also stocked with everything we needed. 

Rooms came with a free bottle of water and were stocked with coffee and liquid creamer. Fridge, safe, and microwave in the room. No continental breakfast, but free coffee brewed in the lobby. The view of the golf course from our room was also a nice treat we weren't expecting! 

Looking forward to staying here again as I often fly out of Mesa Gateway. They of course have a shuttle to the Mesa-Gateway airport which was less than 10 minutes drive away, also across the street from the ASU Polytechnic campus."}
{"text":"We got a good rate of $130/night on Hotwire, but we kind of lost out on location when we rolled the dice because this hotel really isn't convenient to anything except the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. In the end, it met our needs of just needing to a place to crash for two nights after days of drinking beer and watching baseball.

The positives are that even though we were close to the airport, we didn't hear one plane or other extraneous noise. The clubhouse to Toka Sticks Golf Course is about a hundred yards away. The rooms were spacious and the entire site was clean. Parking is free, so is the fully functioning Wi-Fi. You'll need to insert your key into the wall to activate the power in the room, but don't forget to pull it out when you leave. 

Our room didn't receive service during the one day we were there, but it really didn't need it. As stated before, be prepared to drive as there's not much close by. All of the employees we encountered were friendly and overall we were pleased with this hotel."}
{"text":"Best hotel we have ever stayed at by far. Comfortable beds, pet friendly and extremely hospitable and friendly staff. Breakfast was good. We came to see family to celebrate the new year but unfortunately got sick. It was the best place to be sick and comfortable at while having our two small dogs with us. Whatever you guys are doing here - keep it up. We'll be back."}
