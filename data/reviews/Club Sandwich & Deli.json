{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Tuesday morning because none of the other local breakfast/brunch places were open and WOW did we discover a gem.  The owners were so friendly and the food was cooked to order --  all natural and homemade.  We had the fococcia almond french toast which was incredibly tasty and light, but the real winner was the homemade corned beef reuben hash!  holy hell was it good.  Not greasy at all and perfectly done.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't write a review on breakfast, but the owner of this place has his shit together. Can't wait to go back for lunch. Baked bacon in brown sugar and peppery goodness. Thick slices of marbled rye and farm fresh eggs.They state they try not to go too far for fresh ingredients. That's some pretty good farm to table eats. I liked the photos and quotes on the wall, but the place could use a little warmth for atmosphere. It reminded me of my grade school lunchroom with painted brick walls and concrete floors. Just a suggestion. Owners warmth made up for it, anyway."}
{"text":"I finally found a spot close to work that offers some pretty decent food at a considerable value.  I got take-out from Club Sandwich today.  I received a tip from another co-worker to \"call ahead\" to order or I would be waiting my whole lunch break for my lunch. So me and another co-worker decided to call and place our order for pickup.  When I got there our orders were mostly done.  They have weekly specials, todays was order any original sandwich and get a cup of soup for free.  They had other daily specials advertised in the restaurant but not on their website.  I opted to get an Original Sangwich Bavarian Style.  They offer your choice of grilled local steak or free-ranged chicken, and the Bavarian comes with onions, pickles, swiss cheese and black forest mustard on a ciabatta bread.  They advertise that they also have lettuce and tomato on them but there was none on mine.  I am not sure if I had to ask for this but seems as though they forgot.  They also ran out of their soup of the day, beef tortellini, so I went with the Texas Chicken Chili.  The meal was only $6.25 plus tax.  Not a bad deal for a home style lunch.  

The sandwich was pretty tasty, just a little too much bread to steak ratio, but flavors were savory .  The soup strangely appeared to have no chicken.  In fact I proposed the opinion of my co-worker to identify the meat.  Indeed we agreed beef.  Good thing I like beef,  but not sure why they would call it chicken chili.  The chili had a lot of beans and tomatoes in it.  Not spicy, but a good flavor, yet a little oily.  All considered this is definitely a worthy choice for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Club Sandwich is in Sharpsburg. Their breakfasts are HUGE, their coffee is hot, and their potatoes are deep fried. They also make an effort to use local whenever possible. The Reuben Hash was delicious and calorie-rific. If you hate carbs this place is not for you. They have a few salads, but honestly it's called Club Sandwich. I'd buy a membership to this club."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this review.  I'd gladly give the food four stars but the service and the atmosphere don't deserve that rating.  The Saturday morning that we stopped for breakfast, it was pretty slow in terms of customers.  You would think that would equate to good service but instead it meant the girl at the counter spent 75% of her time in the back or kitchen.  Despite us clearly being newbies, she offered very few recommendations on the menu or instructions on ordering ( i.e., The signature sauces, that you had to specify if you wanted to buy the refillable coffee, etc.) 

Also, it was freezing inside the day we visited.  I wore my coat and scarf the entire time we ate.   The walls are just block walls that are painted various colors and there isn't much in the way of decoration.  It didn't feel very welcoming between the service, the space and the cold.  Also, they are not open on Sunday's, which is odd for a place that serves breakfast.

However, the food was very good.  I had the standard eggs, potatoes and toast and my fianc√© had the Reuben hash, which he absolutely loved."}
{"text":"Just had the butternut squash soup yesterday for lunch and it was delicious, not at all too sweet.  If you end up going to Club Sandwich, be sure to ask about the daily specials before you decide on something from the normal menu.  The specials are surprisingly current and interesting dishes, which isn't something I would expect to find in Sharpsburg."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem.  They seem to care a lot about the quality of every little morsel.  Serving sizes are big, tastes great and the prices keep you going back.  They also serve breakfast all day which is a definite plus."}
