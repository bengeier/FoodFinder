{"text":"Good solid food. This isn't a pho house, but they offer top offerings of a few popular categories.  I've had the bun here and it's quite tasty, as is the pho noodles too. The bowls make the portions look small, but they pack a lot of food in those bowls.  I'll be back. The place is clean, the food is good and the hosts are polite and pleasant."}
{"text":"They seem to have opened recently so maybe the quality will improve later on.  The bun (noodle bowl) portion looked small, in a black plastic tupper. Smaller compared with ginger and pho hong.  The com looked like more food (mostly rice tho) is served on a styrofoam box (yes this was for the dine-in option).  We had the grilled chicken banh mi, and we were not impressed. There was very little meat and the toppings didn't fill the whole length of the bread (so you have the sides of the bread empty). I prefer banh mi boys just down the street.  On a positive note, the interior of the shop is nice and modern, thought small. There's a few tables."}
{"text":"Good portion and flavor, I wish my office was closer so that I can have it for lunch every day. I tried the grilled pork vermicelli and the grilled pork on top reminds me of the bbq pork from a Hongkong restaurant, sweet and savory. Spring roll is okay, it's crispy but I'm not a fan of rolls anyways."}
{"text":"The grilled pork here is marinated in a distinctly sweet and savoury flavour, which makes it unique to other bun cha I've tried. The portions were generous, and the service was great. Great addition to the area! We will definitely be back for more!   - Mr. & Mrs. Pork."}
{"text":"I had read the previous reviews about the portion sizes so before I ordered I asked to see the size of the food containers.  I had the grilled chicken vermicelli and the portion is actually quite large.  I don't know if there had been a change, if the owners saw the previous complaints about the portion size, but I was very happy with the quality and the quantity of the food I received."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. It wasn't busy at the time I came. The restaurant owner (I presume) gave us just enough guidance on their menu and left us ample time to decide.   I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli. It domes with a bit of salad and a spring roll on the side. All vermicellis come dry (soup-less). I thought the vermicellis were done well - It wasn't mushy (overboiled) or hard (underboiled). The pork was done more like a Chinese BBQ pork rather than the typical lemongrass grilled and it tasted good.   At $10 per, I think it's a bit expensive for the portion size you get, as well as the overall meal itself. You are paying mostly for a handful of pork. The rest doesn't cost much. Regardless, this is still a good place for lunch if you work nearby, or if you are just in the area and looking for something to eat.   I'd give this place a 3.5/5. **** for friendly staff and solid food. Docking a half * for price-food value."}
{"text":"Billed as an \"Urban Vietnamese Eatery\", Saigon Hustle was opened by the owner of neighbouring Fresh Off The Boat and his mother, the former owner of Bun Saigon in Chinatown. They appear to currently be in soft opening, and have vermicelli and rice platters available, with sandwiches coming soon. They also serve shakes and coffee. The interior was painted in bold red and black, and the atmosphere evokes a bit of Banh Mi Boys, with hip-hop blasting the small space.   I had the Saigon Hustle rice platter ($13.50), which came with beef, prawn (singular), and a small salad with pickled radish. The serving sizes were hefty, although this was mostly rice. The beef itself was dry and tough, although the seasoning was good. My friend had the grilled pork vermicelli, and while the pork was better, the slices were inconsistent in texture as well.   While they claim to be \"urban\", there did not appear to be any difference in the food compared to other more traditional Vietnamese establishments. My concern is that those restaurants can rely on high turnover to keep food coming out fast and fresh, and that Saigon Hustle will need to reach a critical mass before they can achieve a similar quality. As they've just opened, I'm hopeful these kinks can be worked out in the near future."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best banh mi's I've ever had. My expectations weren't very high because I read some of the early reviews... But I don't understand what wasn't to like. The bun, the meat, the whole thing... It was fantastic! And it was under $6 and included a shrimp cold roll. Iced coffee was delicious but I didn't realize it was sweetened, which usually isn't my thing.. But it was good!   I love it here and will be back probably tomorrow.   Had the grilled chicken and grilled pork banh mi."}
{"text":"Got an ice coffee and beef banh mi. The ice coffee was good and something I'd come back for. It just opened up so it was empty but service was great. The banh mi tasted great with the beef tasting well with the veggie and sauce. For the affordable price, I'd come by to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Over the last few years, Banh Mi has become one of my absolute favorite foods. It's so simple and so inexpensive, and yet it can easily go awry with the mishandling of key ingredients.  The Banh Mi at The Saigon Hustle, in the first few bites I took, seemed to be a case-in-point example of this. I ordered the Grilled Beef Banh Mi and I'll admit that the first few bites were not promising. The sandwich seemed to contain a paltry amount of meat and other elements, and the whole thing was just too dry. The saltiness of the sparse grilled beef wasn't offset by mayo, since mayo was almost entirely absent.  But as I made my way to the centre of the sandwich, my opinion began to drastically change. There was just more of everything; more meat, more sauce, more veggies. It was, in its second half, a very enjoyable Banh Mi.  The haphazardly-prepared sandwich is especially surprising, given that the place was pretty much empty. Still, I'd be inclined to give The Saigon Hustle another chance based on how much I liked half of my sandwich."}
{"text":"The portions are misleading. I order a beef and prawn platter, which was reasonably sized but only only had one prawn. This is bush league, especially in this neighborhood when you can go up the street to a proper Vietnamese restaurant. Overpriced and underwhelming. Beef is ok though."}
{"text":"Saigon Hustle's take on classic Vietnamese food is fantastic. Especially their Vermicelli options (marinate on the meats). Also my first order through Ritual they forgot to provide my extra spring roll (I was reimbursed) - on my next order, they recognized my name and gave me an extra spring roll. Pretty good customer service if you ask me.  Best Vietnamese in the Queen West area."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Cheap and fresh! The grilled beef banh mi tastes like juicy jerky perfectly balanced with the freshness of the veggies."}
{"text":"Came by to Saigon Hustle around 11:45am on a Monday. Located near Spadina and Queen, this small eatery is by the corner of Cameron and Queen. The place was empty when I got there but as I was eating, people would come in and out to pick up orders, etc. The eatery only has seating for about 10-12 people.  Service was friendly and I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli (which came with spring rolls). Portions were just right and the price wasn't too bad (~$11.50). If I'm ever around the area wouldn't mind coming back to try their banh mis or rice platters!"}
