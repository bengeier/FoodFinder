{"text":"We just went here for lunch.   This place is wonderful!   Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the most unbelievable food.   I cannot wait to go back and try some other menu items.    We just came back from a vacation in Hawaii, and nothing we ate there was even remotely close to the quality and taste of this food.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great concept. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's always been a little hot and humid when I go in, and the type of music they play. It gets pretty loud and with the techno beat of the music, it can be hard to have a conversation. Each time I've gone in, it's been an over 30 crowd, so I'm guessing I'm not alone in this. If those two things get fixed it will be 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place like this in the Valley that offers a healthy clean eating menu with great taste. I would highly recommend this place if you like grilled seafood it's great!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Bro Perspective: 

Good clean and fast protein meal. It is like a chipotle without the tortillas and meat. If the owner is reading this...you should include tortillas as a side item. Everyone loves a fish taco place out here. Besides that the place is perfect for your quick healthy meal-seeker. Yes they have their downfalls right now...they are brand new. Coleslaw was not what the pretty little cashier said it was going to be, but she was cute, so I am not even mad. To be honest its good fish (IDK if its fresh) but it taste great and its great concept. Do not listen to all the haters. Give it try. 

Thank you, 

Ben"}
{"text":"Ahi Mahi Fish Grill is definitely my go to fish restaurant.  Every time we go it seems to get better and better.  I am one who likes to try everything offered on the menu.  This time I started with the Clam Chowder and found it delicious.  I ordered the Cajun flavored Swai (in our terms \"blackened catfish\") with a side of house salad and their super Tomato/Bean soup.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  My wife had the Chowder and what now has become her favorite, Salmon with the Creamy Garlic-Butter sauce, salad and the T&B soup.  We have vowed to make this our Friday night place to go.  (P.S.  All the booths were filled this night which indicates that Ahi Mahi Fish Grill is really catching on.)"}
{"text":"Great prices, and the food is solid and great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Had great experience. Tried the grilled mahi mahi with brown rice it's simply delicious."}
{"text":"I really wish the salmon was wild caught and not farm raised. I'd even be willing to pay a little more to have it as an option.  If you going for healthy, offer the healthiest option!"}
{"text":"This location seems cursed with restaurants that open with good concepts and poor execution.  I got the combo white fish and chicken with creamed corn and salad.  The fish was not cooked, very grey and limp in appearance and the chicken is that weird kind that comes in cheap teriyaki bowls.  The salad was inedible with very tough tomatoes.  The creamed corn was okay but had way too much cream.  My friend got the popcorn shrimp and clam chowder and didn't like either.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"An issue with the cash register was promptly resolved and the staff offered me a discount. Besides this hiccup, the food is always great. I keep coming back a few times a month."}
{"text":"Love the grilled salmon with garlic butter. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Ahi Mahi Fish Grill. I always get their Mahi Mahi with the Cajin Bam seasoning. Creamed corn is pretty darn good, spicy shrimp appetizer I love - what is in that sauce?! so good! - fries are on point, although a bit salty. I love how moist their fish is and how good it tastes, very fresh and yummy. I don't eat meat but I eat fish, a pescatarian as they say. So i've had my fair share of fish, this place is top notch. I highly recommend it! Atmosphere is low key but don't expect much. Great food, and well worth the price. Have enjoyed each of my visits, even pick up to-go a couple times a month. Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and a great value. I'm so happy to have a healthy and fast casual lunch spot available. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Omg. This food is really really good. I love it. The staff are awesome. And the food is always always HOTTEST FRESH OFF THE GRILL.HOT FRESH FOOD AND IT IS HEALTHY Awesome portions this is what fast food should be. I love the salmon it is so yummy. And it neat my salon Jacksons Hair Boutique  so can call in an order and pic it up and be right back at the salon to service more clients. I'm from Chicago and when I moved here there aren't  a lot of fish markets to buy fish from so this cured my ill. Always happy.  Thanks Ahi Mahi"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner. 

Service was good staff friendly. 

Food was tasty and fresh. 

I had salmon with garlic butter sauce, nice size portion, started with chowder. 

Garlic fries enjoyable and the grilled zucchini was great."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed and disappointed in this place. My girlfriend and I have been waiting to splurge for lunch at this place. 
When we walked in the place looked very modern. We ordered with a cashier clerk and told her it was our first time. She seemed to be in a rush and did not give us any suggestions from the menu. We decided on the salmon and brown rice with steamed veggies. 
We were incredibly hungry and anticipated our delish salmon dish that our friend had told us about. 
When our buzzer went off I walked up and redeemed my plate. I sat down and my gf and I quietly began to eat. She Pointed out that the veggies were uncooked.... which made me want to question the salmon. However, the salmon was cooked well. The brown rice was served cold too, which did not make me feel good about my purchase. 
Also, the calamari dish that we ordered was okay. 
I can not say that I will be back to give them a second chance..."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 fried fish dinners to go..This is the second time that I got grilled fish, Lara Rucker typed in the order.. Dumb is as dumb does.. Called and talked to an ornimental  girl..Got 2 duhs and a huh from her ..Could be worse tho, they could be working for me..

{"text":"I drove from California and not expecting a great seafood place in scottsdale.this will be my new destination whenever I come to scottsdale, Thank Ahi Mahi fish grill for serving such a fresh seafood in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great concept, poorly executed. Food is prepared to order but not in a logical order - appetizers came out after the meal. Fish portions are so thin that the sauce/dressing overwhelms the fish; fish also ends up over cooked. The one highlight was the grilled swai lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I saw the announcement of this restaurant's opening in the Business Journal. Being a Seattle native, and quite used to fresh seafood, I was encouraged to try it along with my brother. On a week night, we were warmly greeted by owner Rully and his staff. I ordered the Java Ahi tuna with vegetables and brown rice. The tuna was cooked 'al dente'...just right, fresh, firm, moist and flavorful. The vegetables were also 'al dente'...fresh, crisp, steamed just right. We liked the concept, ambience and food...a great value for seafood in the 'Desert' today. 
Rully was very engaging with customers, came over to visit our table, as well as another family's table. You could see his passion for his new business, and strong desire to please customers. He brought us a sample of their clam chowder, which was Outstanding! Hand cut potatoes, bigger chunks of clams, and a tasty broth less 'full' than typical white chowder. Our only disappointment was the calamari appetizer, too over-cooked, not 'al dente' as the other dishes. We wouldn't order that again, but we'll definitely be back to try other entrees. Rully is expanding with more locations in Metro Phoenix, which should be successful with his commitment to quality!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, I guess. It just seemed overpriced for food served on a paper plate.  My wife got the prawns which were served unpeeled, complete with the legs. I was disappointed that the coleslaw was actually a cabbage salad with dressing on top, rather than mixed together.  The crispy scallops were more breading than scallops.  But we really likes the tomato beans, and they had good flavors."}
{"text":"Wow our food took 45min to come out on a slow Tuesday night. I understand that happens but an apology goes a long way! The food was good but the wait just ruined the experience and we will never return."}
{"text":"Great place and a must try super clean and healthy! Had the mahi mahi with garlic butter and the cajun ahi..both were cooked great and were great quality"}
{"text":"One word- delicious!  Fresh, tasty, clean. Nice facility and great service. Yummy clam chowder. My 5 year old son said \"the broccoli is off the chain\". I have no idea where he learned that, but for a kid who only eats fries and rice, enough said!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute winner...Great people, prices, food quality..A+ all the way around.  Had the grilled Mahi Mahi, salad and grilled Zucchini for $9.99 and it was better than most high end Scottsdale eateries where you would pay three times that much! Spoke with the owner/Mgr for quite awhile...Very cool guy with a good business head...I'm thinking they're here to stay...I wish them great success!"}
{"text":"Healthy & very reasonably priced. Fast food that's so different from everything else. Loved it and will go back often! I got the grilled mahi mahi topped with their tomato concasse (a smokey tomato sauce), grilled zucchini, and brown rice. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Grilled fish w/ healthy side options fast and reasonably priced. First visit today. I got the grilled Mahi w/ zucchini and creamed corn. It was grilled to order so expect to wait a little longer than a typical fast food place but not a long wait by any means (maybe 8 min?).  Friendly workers and the place was clean. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have been eating consistently at this place at least once a week for a while. The food is great, and I think the staff is always friendly walking in. That being said, over the past 2 months or so, an awful, AWFUL smell has been building and building and has gotten to the point where I can't even walk into the place. I don't know if it's a bad grease trap, rotting fish, clogged garbage disposal... who knows, but I can't possibly trust eating from a place that smells worse than a 3 week old porta-potty. I have to think that a health inspector is going to walk into this place and severely mark them down, and again this is coming from someone who REALLY like the food! Please, someone who oversees this place, so something about your restaurant because I know for a fact I'm not the only person who's stopped coming in because of this. It's the only reason I'm giving such a low rate; honestly if something would be done it'd deserve as good a rating as anything else around, but the fact that it's been going (and getting worse) for so long just can't settle with me."}
{"text":"Amazing food 
I tried the tilapia grilled Cajun with grilled zucchini and brown rice 
The tilapia tasted very fresh and there was just enough spice to it with the Cajun bam 
The zucchini need a little more salt and pepper but that to taste 
The brown rice was just regular brown rice but I didn't expect anything great when it comes to brown rice 
Portion sides were even for what you payed for 
The employees were very friendly and offered me samples since it was my first time 
Sampled the clam chowder it was great will get a full bowl next time"}
{"text":"Customer service was great, they were warm and inviting but unfortunately my food was just ok. I ordered the mahi mahi with creamy butter and garlic sauce, brown rice and seasonal vegetables on the side. I thought the fish would be cooked with the sauce but they served it on the side which was fine with me. The sauce tasted nothing like garlic or buttery it just tasted plain. Everything was so bland! Needed some salt on everything. Besides the seasoning, or lack there of, the vegetables had a nice bite to it. The fish did not taste fishy at all which was an A+ in my book.
My husband ordered the fish tacos and that was absolutely delicious. The slaw was yummy and the sauce that came with the dish was great. I would definitely come back for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Solid fast casual.  Mahi mahi with the tomato sauce was pretty good, not dry at all.  I loved the cole slaw!!!!  I think the concept is pretty cool, but the prices seem a wee bit high.  I'd like to try the steak next time.  The portions are solid and the food is a little elevated so it may justify the price if they are consistent and bring the same quality more often than not."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about fish away from water but this place surprised me. I ordered the Swai (white fish) with Java sauce. Sooo yummy! Moist fish, not fishy at all so you know it was as fresh as it could be, and the sauce was super tasty. I paired it with grilled zucchini and the garlic fries - both flavorful and perfectly cooked. 
To share with my office mates I ordered the calamari. I give it a C. Not a huge fan of the balsamic drizzle and it seemed too chewy. Sent it back with a coworker who went to get lunchbox herself after tasting mine and the manager/owner refunded my card plus gave me a free entree card. Wow! He recalled my order and shared that he thinks it was overcooked. 
Very impressed with the customer service - all staff was very friendly wearing smiles. Will absolutely be back for more than my free meal! 

7/18/15 Bummed: 2nd trip & my husband's Swai order was undercooked. Fingers crossed we don't get sick.  Went back and they credited the card and gave two free entrees. (I didn't use the free entree from the other trip so now we have 3 free. Might be turned off to go back)"}
{"text":"Little bit of a smell when walking in, but gave them the benefit of the doubt that was due to all the fish. But then the bathroom smelled even worse - like a dirty wet mop, albeit with dried urine smell also. The ice machine was broken so no ice for the warm ice tea. There is an Albertson's next-door so why not go buy some ice for your customers? The prawn and ahi tuna special was OK. My daughters popcorn shrimp were actually pretty good, could taste shrimp and not just fried batter. Another example of how the staff could care less about customers is that when two of them left together their car was the first spot in front of the door. No doubt it had been parked there since they opened, denying a prime spot for customers. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally a fresh, healthy quick serve restaurant in south Scottsdale--I absolutely love the salmon and mahi mahi!  I've had both with their creamy butter sauce with brown rice and grilled zucchini, they were delicious. 

I definitely recommend the fish lettuce wraps, great twist on them especially with the butter lettuce.  I can't wait to try the grilled prawns next, such a great concept."}
{"text":"Talk about a pleasant surprise! I was on my way to another restaurant when I discovered this new concept. It's tucked between Smashburger and Chipotle, which is appropriate because it's a similar fast-casual type place. Except it features seafood!

I'm an Arizona native and I love seafood. It's really a treat to find good seafood in the desert. It's even more impressive to find fresh seafood in the desert for prices this reasonable! The variety of fish available (Swai, Mahi Mahi, Salmon to name a few) is different than most places.  

Choose your fish, choose a sauce and they grill it. There is a distinct emphasis on healthy choices and sides. Speaking of sides, the coleslaw is really good. This is the first place I've enjoyed coleslaw made the way my mother prepared it... With raisins!

I was half expecting to see fish tacos on the menu. As much as I love them, I'm glad they aren't available. You can get fish tacos almost anywhere. This isn't a southwest/Mexican type restaurant. It's more about the coast than a region. My only criticism about the menu, would be to expand the variety of seafood. I think I saw shrimp and scallops as appetizers. But it would be great to also have some clams or mussels. Not much of a complaint really.

The staff was helpful, made some good suggestions, and were very friendly. Plus, the music was really hip. I'm glad this place is nearby to home and work. I'm definitely going to recommend this to my co-workers when we venture out next time. Thank you for giving me another reason to avoid Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"My visit: meh

Stopped in here for lunch since the line for chipotle was so long. Well with how long it took to prepare my tuna I should've just went to chipotle. This was when I was the only customer there ordering. 

My tuna steak tasted like tuna out of a can, the brown rice undercooked, and the grilled zucchini was tasty but probably because it was bathed in either oil or butter. My meal plus a drink was around $15. 

Not sure if I'll give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Fresh food, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff! The decor makes you feel like your near the beach waiting for the fish to be caught out back! Best clam chowder I've ever had, the fries are perfectly seasoned and they offer a great variety of sauces. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for something different. We both had the fried tilapia and it comes with your choice of sauce and two sides. I had the creamy garlic butter with a house salad and the spicy aioli and the garlic fries. My boyfriend had on his fried tilapia the java sauce, creamed corn and edamame. The portions were really good as we will probably split it next time. We were both expecting different batter on the fish as the batter didn't have any seasoning and there was a lot of it on the fish. The sauce that was on my fish I thought was going to be more of a buttery sauce but it's like gravy! I didn't see that part on the menu when I ordered. Don't think I'll get that sauce again. My hot fish was sitting on my salad so it made my salad wilt. The fries were awesome and the salad that was not under the hot fish was good. I don't think we will get anything fried again as we didn't like the batter. My boyfriend didn't really rave about his lunch so I'm not sure how he felt about all of it as a whole. The restaurant was very nice and clean. We will for sure try it again though but just try something else."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The best salmon I have ever had! And the prices aren't too bad. The service is exceptional and the people are very nice."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. Was excited to finally have a quick fish place that wasn't the national fried fish chain.

Staff was really friendly and lots of smiling. Great start. I ordered the Cajun tilapia with a side of grilled zucchini and white bean soup. Everything was cooked nicely and the Cajun spice had some heat but not overpowering. There is a little condiment bar with peppers and salsas if you want. 

My wife had the grilled Mahi with a side salad. Her fish was also cooked nicely. 

But, as we're leaving, I notice a small chalkboard listing where everything is from. Only the Mahi is wild caught and according to Seafood watch, not even in a sustainable country. I assumed my tilapia was safely harvested in an American or Canadian farm, but it was not. Even the salmon is farm raised and nearly everyone knows farmed salmon is brimming with antibiotics and added hormones.

Letdown."}
{"text":"For fast, fresh, healthy... This place is great. Tried the grilled mahi mahi with garlic, creamed corn, and grilled zucchini, yum!  The zucchini was Sweet and smoky, the fish was done well and had great flavor, and it was all $10.  Thank goodness this place replaced the pizza place going in, this is a great fast casual restaurant concept."}
{"text":"Loved their tilapia Cajun with grilled veggies. They have a lot of fish choices to choose from and so happy to find a place that actually grills their fish opposed to breading and frying it. Looking forward to trying their calamari"}
{"text":"Well... I was very excited to visit after all of the Facebook postings I had been following.. after visiting I left partially disappointed. To start I ordered the calamari which in the picture look alike crisp fresh take on calamari I was excited. I also ordered the swai fish which was accompanied by coleslaw and french fries. I was excited by the order staff as they were happy friendly and eager to help place an order the appearance of the restaurant was clean and in order. Now for the bad and good. The fish was fresh the batter was light and Crisp , in all it was really good. The French fries were fresh as well but had a strange extra coat of sugar mixed in with the seasoning salt I would probably prefer that to be held back a bit. For the coleslaw it had a strange dressing on top of it which was different from the picture of a light vinaigrette. Also for the calamari I was disappointed as the picture looks completely different than what was ordered for the price as an appetizer I felt it was not worth it. The pic looks light and fresh...I received bag frozen... Or so it seemed? I would return possibly in a few months to see if there are any changes to the menu or upgrades as there are many great thoughts and points but it just needs a little help ."}
{"text":"I was in the other day and had the mahi with Cajun seasoning.  The fish was good but I could have done without whatever sauce they put on top for some reason.  The cole slaw didn't have enough dressing for my taste and the creamed corn was swimming in cream.  I'm also not wild about the iced tea coming from a machine instead of fresh brewed. The prices are reasonable and It's an OK dining option but I like the other quick serve fish place in town better."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop for a quick bite. Hungry for fish. So we choose Ahi Mahi. Friendly greeting at the door. Female cashier very informative about menu items and answered questions with a smile. I ordered cajun fish tacos. It came with two 3 oz tacos, no sides. Tasty and just the right portion for me. Bob ordered Cajun Mahi Mahi. It came with 2 sides. He had rice and salad. He said the Cajun seasoning had just the right kick to it. The food is fresh and made to order. This is a great concept for a restaurant! ~ Serve & specialize in something different and appealing, something healthy, and made fresh in front of you. Mmmmm makes us wanna come back! :-)"}
{"text":"My parents introduced my husband and I to this restaurant, which is really a fast casual concept. I ordered the salmon and chicken, which came with 2 sides. I got the zucchini and brown rice for the sides. Everything I ate was very good and it comes on a good size plate. I was hungry again a few hours later though. It's very healthy here so definitely check this place out if you're searching for a healthy and tasty spot!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Salmon and zucchini are amazing! Food is prepared fairly quickly and a great substitute to Chipotle haha. Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavor and a decent price. Just need to find out where their fish come from. If USA in origin, thats great. If Vietnam or other Asian country.....might make it more harmful than healthy.   Will post when I find out.

Update. Not the healthiest of fish and spotty service. Change from 4 to 2 stars"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how nice this place was. The food was really good, reasonably priced, and the concept is really fun! I'm definitely coming here again, because I originally drove to this location for the Smash Burger next door; however seeing a fish type place looked more healthy and refreshing, and boy did it deliver! 

Their sauces are amazing! And it's a great place to sit down and chat with friends!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fish grill so I gave it a try. The food is very fresh, nice cook and the design looks co cool, that I haven't seen from the similar restaurant. I like the fish and chicken, should try shrimp also. Price is reasonable and service is good"}
{"text":"All the food was cold by the time it got to the table. They forgot three of the items we ordered and after their third trip back to the table they finally got it right. Went with a couple other people and tried a variety of items. Prawns had no taste. Scallops were okay for the first couple but as they rapidly lost any heat they started to taste like bread crumb balls. Garlic fries were beyond salty, and as someone who puts salt on their salt, that is saying something. The clam chowder was very disappointing. The java calamari tasted like maple syrup on a  flavorless chewy substance. 

The one redeeming factor was the staff. They were very nice and checked in on us through out the meal."}
{"text":"This place is an exceptional value at an exceptional price.

I've had both the Salmon and the Mahi Mahi with the dry rub seasoning. Large portion, perfectly cooked, and delicious. 

Everything about the place is a little unique. You pick one of seven fish choices with the option of 4 sauces with two sides. The food is rich with flavor from the fresh fish to the healthy coleslaw. 

Everything I had was well prepared and tasty. And the atmosphere is not for date night but clean and spacious.

What are you waiting for....GO!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I've been waiting for a place like this to open up! Clean protein. Fresh vegetables. Brown rice. 

It is healthy, affordable, and has a great atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Fish is was really fresh and cooked to the perfect temperature. Seasoned just right. A lot of different sides to choose from. Perfect healthy meal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in front of the restaurant 15 minutes before they close.  The employees ran to the door as I was walking towards it and they told me they were closed. Clearly something's wrong here. The sign on the door says open till 10 p.m. very bad service on my first time here."}
{"text":"Great customer service friendly. Food is good big healthy portions and great prize. The grilled zucuni, fish, and fish tacos was good."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty for a discount fish place. Might be a little pricey for some for lunch as you can spend between $12 and $15 pretty easily. The salmon was very good but, like another reviewer said, was a little overwhelmed with the sauce because the pieces of salmon are pretty thin. I love sauce so it didn't bother me!  Most people wouldn't want to wait as long as it would take to cook a big thick piece of salmon though. The salad was fresh and pretty good. I wasn't super impressed with the dressing.  I got garlic fries but couldn't detect any garlic on the fries. But they were very good plain fries. 

Overall, I would say it's a good value for the money.  I like the concept and the interior was very hip and upbeat. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Where do I start!  The service was incredible!  Greeted and acknowledged when you step in the door!

I have been there several times now, and it has only gotten better and better.  As if that were possible! 

I have had the Tilapia, Swai, and the white fish.  All were fresh, tasty, and perfectly grilled!  I had the Tomato Beans and the Cole Slaw as my sides.  The beans are perfectly cooked, not mushy, and the Cole slaw was a great enhancement, without an over amount of dressing!  DELECTABLE!!!  And the Clam Chowder.......mouth watering good!

I love everything about this place!  The food, the service, and pleasantries are a triple threat!

This is my new place for fresh fish!  My search has ended!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This place is great for a quick and healthy meal. Came for lunch and got the grilled swai (white fish) with salad and seasonal vegetables. Next time I'll try one of their combo plates. Reasonably priced and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Really liked the popcorn shrimp. Not greasy at all. Reminded me of tempura. Fries are seasoned just right. Clam chowder soup really really good. But no crackers. Oh well. Can't wait  to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a seafood lover and living in the desert, there's always been a big void in quality seafood...until now.  Just heard about Ahi Mahi and rushed down to try this new offering.  Even sweeter was their 50% entree special.  I had grilled salmon, brown rice and grilled zucchini.  He tried the sweet glazed chicken with fries and coleslaw.  And we shared a popcorn shrimp appetizer with a spicy tasty sauce on the side.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  One snag - no dressing on the cole slaw but they gave us a side of dressing when we asked.  

Portions are very ample.  I ended up taking half of my salmon meal home.  For a return visit, think I'd like to try several appetizers - shrimp (again!!) and fish sticks, add a side of fresh veggies or french fries and we've got lunch.

Nice atmospere but temp was a little hot & muggy on our afternoon visit, maybe they are still working out the A/C deal.  

Great friendly service, reasonable prices, clean and well-stocked condiment bar.  Good work, Ahi Mahi.  I'm looking forward to a long seafood relationship."}
{"text":"I really really like the food and concept here. Choose each item; a fish a sauce 2 sides. And a great condiment bar. Ive tried and liked the creamed corn, Mahi Mahi, salmon, zucchini. And the fish lettuce wraps. Yum"}
{"text":"I respect an independent restaurant like this going up against Chipotle and Smashburger, both growing giants in the fast casual scene. You don't see true fast casual seafood restaurant, so there is clearly room for this concept and Ahi Mahi gets it mostly right.

Instead of 1 piece of fish, my Salmon came in two very thin pieces. Thankfully neither of them were overcooked, this is a major victory. I'm not sure if they freshly grill the fish upon order, or they have been sitting there but freshness was on point. I didn't have to wait too long for my meal either. Seasoning wise, the cajun rub could have been spicier and bolder but it was not offensive. One gripe with the fish was after cooking, it seems some clarified butter or a light butter sauce was put on the fish. I didn't like what that did to the texture. The fish was served with two sides and a piece of kinda-fresh grill bread.

I couldn't try the coleslaw because of a nut allergy, so I went with the fries which came hot, fresh, and well seasoned. Putting a slight amount of sugar in the seasoning is a page from WingStop's book that I enjoyed. The \"organic salad\" (basic side salad) was on the small side, the home made dressing kinda reminded me of a light thousand island. All the ingredients were fresh and lively.

Although the fish looked like a strong portion, it really didn't fill me up. Soon after I finished some local shopping I spent 2$ for a large chili at Wendys. I like the menu at AM Frish and with time these minor execution errors can be remedied. I recommend that they offer in addition to the normal menu; some sort of a larger portion, maybe a thick cut piece of fish for an upcharge. I truly prefer thicker fish and am willing to wait and pay for it. I'll be back when I get burnt out from burrito bowls. 

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Delicious! We just moved to the area and my boyfriend loves fish, so we thought we'd try it out for lunch today. So glad we found this place! While I'm not a fish person, I got the beef and it was so good in a sweet sauce. He got the mahi mahi with Cajun spice and pretty much inhaled it. Love the quick, fresh feel of the place and will definitely be back!  He did mention that the portion of the fish was a little on the small side for the price, but I recall the menu saying it was wild-caught mahi mahi which I think is the reason and definitely makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Place was above average but always had a bit of a funky smell...new place figured that whole smell thing out apparently lol."}
{"text":"Great value! So glad I decided to test them out.  Healthy, flavorful and totally affordable!  Hop this new place does well since I love the idea of eating freshly grilled fish for lunch.  Girl at front (manager, I believe!)is also sweet and uses customer names. Place is spotless and great seating avail too"}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant has caused problems for previous businesses since it's sandwiched between a Chipotle and Smashburger but Ahi Mahi fish grill should be here to stay.

There are fairly limited options when it comes to finding fresh and flavorful fish in the scottsdale area unless you're willing to spend over $30 for a meal.

This place is very affordable and their menu options are really all over the board.

I ordered grilled mahi with the java sauce and it came with 2 sides, the grilled zucchini is so good and the seasonal veggies made it a healthy option.

My roommate ordered the prawns and they didn't disappoint as well.

All in all I would recommend this place to anyone that is craving seafood that they normally need to go to the coastal areas for."}
{"text":"Finally, something different and exciting for a quick meal! We have been four or five times now and been very satisfied. The staff is warm and inviting and the restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing. Most times we get the glazed beef over brown rice and the grilled zucchini. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Met an AOB buddy here for lunch. The first thing is parking. This restaurant is located on the S.E. corner of Scottsdale Rd & Thomas Rd in the Albertson's center next to Chipotle. Parking can be a bit of a hassle. The Friday S & I met, there was very little open parking at 12:15.
The facility itself was very clean. S & I were politely greeted by Audrey G. as we walked in the front doors. After checking out the menu S & I made our choices.
S ordered the Grilled Mahi, Cajun style with Coleslaw and garlic fries. ($10.99).
I ordered the same thing but with seasoned vegetables instead of the Coleslaw. ($10.99).
Then came the wait. And boy did we wait. 18 minutes from the time I was handed my receipt to the time our name was called. Yes, there was a good lunch crowd but I think honestly the girl working the grill was a bit overwhelmed. 
The portion size of everything on the plate was decent. There was a good pile of fries and they were nicely seasoned with a mild garlic flavor. The seasoned vegetables were undercooked and a bit on the hard side, hence the 4 Star. There was a good selection however as my order contained Broccoli, Green & Yellow Zucchini and Carrots. Impressive selection for a restaurant of this level. The Mahi Mahi was nicely grilled, again, a tad over cooked but not to the point of being to dry to eat. The Cajun seasoning gave the fish a very nice added kick of flavor without being overwhelming. Winner winner Mahi Mahi dinner.
S said the Coleslaw was fine and that was the only difference between our lunches. Personally, since they were both the same price, I think my plate with the nice pile of vegetables was a better deal than S's and his pile of Coleslaw. But, that's a personal preference.
We also got fountain drinks. ($1.99)
Lousy parking. Nice Staff. S L O W service. Great portion size. Fair pricing. 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried tilapia with garlic butter sauce, plus cream corn and rice. The fish had barely any flavor to it - it seemed almost like they didn't even season it with salt? The batter was tasteless too, though maybe that was my fault for ordering fried fish instead of grilled. 

Cream corn was yummy, the rice was just rice. 

Decor was nice, the place was clean, and the staff was friendly. 

Would try again, ordering grilled fish instead."}
{"text":"My hubby and I both had the Cajun Mahi with brown rice and zucchini.  Definitely fresh and healthy!  My only suggestion is that they need to have Soy Sauce as one of their condiments.  We tried the sweet glaze they provide but it didn't do the trick.  Rice without soy is like a day without sunshine!"}
