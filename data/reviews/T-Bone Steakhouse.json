{"text":"poor service and poor food. Was there several years ago with about 12 friends, the food and service was great.  Just recently went there on a Friday, which was very busy. My boyfriend and i got seated right away. The waiteress took our order and never came back until our food was ready. We waited 58 minutes for our food, only because we caught another waiteress and ask for our food, Should have left at that time. We had ordered steak and chicken breast. Well the steak was well over cooked and the chicken breast was a breast with wings. i dont like wings and it just ruined my appetite. Only good food there was their bread. I told all my friends who had been there with me before about my experience. Not sure i would ever go there again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.  This place used to have a view for the four or five tables that are by the window.  But, with the housing development encroaching on it, the view is not very good at all.  And, if you're not at a table with a window, forget it.  The food was decent.  Salad bar was pretty lame.  Tables are picnic tables, with benches without backs.  We drove from Chandler ... it wasn't worth the drive."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years and I stopped going, not for any other reason other than just trying out other places. I recently went back when I seen a post on the Laveen facebook page.  It made me want to go again, if only to see if things had changed. Nothing has changed, the view is still beautiful, it's still a cowboyish/girlish sorta place that has nostalgia.  My husband had the combo and loved it, I had the ribs and they were simply amazing. They have a great kids menu too.  We really like this place and we will go back.  I would have given it 5 stars and the only problem i had is we got there right at 5ish when they open and it was really hot inside. They must turn up the air until they are open. It just made it a bit uncomfortable. But, all in all it was a good dinner and a pleasant evening out."}
{"text":"We love eating here!  I would like to see more on the menu, but maybe the beauty is their simple menu.  We haven't been there since they added desert, but when we go again I will have desert for sure."}
{"text":"I can't decide if I love this place, or just kind of like it.  I'm wavering back and forth...  The boyfriend and I discovered this place while wandering around the area trying to figure out what some lights were on South Mountain.  Despite driving past hundreds of times, we hadn't noticed them before and were trying to find their source.  In the process, we came across T-Bone... and the delicious smells emanating from it.  Intent on our search, we pressed on to learn the lights were from an unknown-to-us parking lot/trailhead...  and we came back to T-Bone the next weekend for dinner.  I was hoping it'd be wonderful, since it seemed like a great, unique to Arizona, place to take the parents when they come to visit.  It has a wonderful atmosphere.  Very rustic and homey.  That some people had come by on horses simply added to the charm.  I loved it.  It also has a beautiful view - just high enough up on the mountain that you can see the city and most of the valley.    The source of my indecision is on the food.  They have a very limited menu.  That's fine with me - I'd rather have a restaurant with only 10 menu items that they do REALLY well than one with 100 items that are so so.  You basically pick your meat off of the menu on the wall, and... that's that.    Everything is served with the 'salad bar' - lettuce, bagged croutons, chopped tomatos and onions, and 3-4 kinds of dressing - beans and bread.  They have a handful of extra sides you can order a la cart.  I didn't try any of those, but the included sides were... ok.  The bread was bread; nothing special.  It was served with butter that was so cold it was almost unspreadable on the soft bread.  The beans were... alright.  I ate them because, well... there wasn't anything else to eat.    So, that's the part that has me going 'eh...' part of the reason the rating is down to 3 stars.  BUT... I ordered fish and it was really delicious.  They didn't do anything fancy with it - just pan fried it with a little seasoning - and it was wonderful.  It was a celebration of the flavor of the fish, not any fancy sauces or such.  Simple and delicious.  I can't comment on the steak, which I assume is their signature dish.  The boyfriend ordered ... I think it was a T-bone... and found it too fatty for his tastes.  Neither of us know whether that is characteristic of the cut (i.e. they served good meat, and he just ordered the wrong cut) or if it was not a good piece of meat.    On the very plus side, they have GREAT beers.  Not a lot of them, but they are apparently brewed at their northern Phoenix location, and are quite tasty.  The service was good - our waitress was friendly and the wait wasn't too long for our food.  Our waitress didn't have any trouble with our moving outside to eat dessert (something in the restaurant - maybe the smokiness from the grill - caused the boyfriend to have an allergy attack).  The dessert - apple pie & ice cream - was very tasty.  So... overall, I'm torn.  Great fish, beer and pie... so so sides and a wildcard steak.  How do you rate that?  I guess three stars for the moment....  We'll definitely go back (I want to try their smoked chicken entree) and hopefully have a more definitive experience."}
{"text":"We have been searching for an off the beaten path steakhouse that grilled cowboy styled steak to perfection like the Silver Saddle in Tucson.  On a friends recommendation we headed to T-Bone.  We liked the view from their location atop of South Mountain.  And, the grounds are well kept.  However, the FOOD, SERVICE, and Server Hygiene  missed the mark.  The salad bar was stocked with Coffee Cup Size Bowls to make salad with the most basic ingredients.  The garden variety of greens however was fresh.  One of the entrees had to be sent back because it was not what we ordered.  When the steak we ordered was served it was over cooked and a little dry.  Still the flavor wasn't bad.  The sides were nothing to brag about either.  In a fine food establishment a manager would have come by to apologize for the mishaps and perhaps offer some accommodation.  There was no exhibit of that kind of class here.  Oh, and we watched the server sweep the floor then serve food without washing her hands...My girl is a germophobe so that didn't go over well.  The ambience inside was also lacking.  We were thinking the owners should sell the place to someone that wants to be in the business.  The location (VIEW) is being wasted."}
{"text":"A maze ing!!!!!!!  The ribs were the best!  It was a full rack of tender flavorful yumminess. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Despite the view over looking the city of Phoenix this place is definitely 2 thumbs down. First timers here we regret our visit, food was fine when it had to be corrected, service was slow i like to be waited on not the other way around it wasn't busy at all. The manager (kinda) dude wouldn't discount or comp any portion of our meal and server wasn't very attentive. Im sticking to other steak houses such as Longhorn and Blackangus."}
{"text":"Worst food and experience ever- we had a large party food was messed up, steaks were dry, chicken was dry sides came out after our meals came, some came out as we were leaving.  Had to take 2 steaks back because they were not cooked right, brought them back and they were beyond burnt couldn't even eat it.  Got the bill and they charged us for their mistakes, we had an extra filet on our bill and the manager told the waitress well they ordered 2 steaks so charge them for it.  We had to order another steak because they gave the filet to another person at the table and they started eating it.  The poor waitress didn't want to go and get the manager to correct this based off of what he already said wanted to pay for it herself.  Finally the manager came and he acted like this was the first time he heard about it, beyond rude.  Disappointing as we had family and friends in town and heard such great things about this place.  We will never come back ....."}
{"text":"I am writing this review from the point of view of my meal, mind you the other 4 people in our party had no issue; I guess I drew the short straw. I am a firm believer that steak should be enjoyed and let me tell you when you get a bad steak after looking forward to it all day it tends to set a unpleasant mood for the rest of the evening. Lets get to the review:  The appearance was clean and casual, kind of a cowboy feel which I rather like. Tables were clean and we were greeted promptly when we entered. Drinks were served and refills were kept up with, for all his duties the server did his job.  Now on to the food. When you order your meal you get a side of \"cowboy beans\", bread, and the salad bar. The beans are served in a community bowl for the table to share, the bread is nothing special just fat slices of wheat bread and hard single serve packs of butter. The salad bar was simply prepackaged grocery store lettuce salad mix with a few extras, unimpressive.   This brings me to the main course, I ordered the 14oz rib-eye cooked to medium. The meat came out and upon my second cut it seemed....undercooked to say the least. I worked around the steak looking for cooked areas only to be further disappointed with how undercooked my steak was. Now I usually order steak cooked medium to allow for that chance to be over/under cooked a little as each chef is different. I call it the safe way to order, however this was well below medium. Heck I wouldn't even call it medium-rare, aside from the browning on each side the center was cold and just plain raw. I was able to pick 5 not so raw bites before I could no longer stomach it. I of course notified the server and I was offered to have it cooked a little more. Now I have a personal fear of sending food back to have it \"fixed\", I declined and explained the last bite I had was nearly raw and killed my appetite. The manager came out and asked again if I wanted it cooked more, again I declined. He then gave the excuse \"well every cook is different\". There was no offer of compensation or way to make it better, after a few more minutes of staring at the cow on my plate the manager was confronted and asked if he can do anything, to which he took 9.00 of my 19.00 meal and explained how expensive that cut of meat is. He insisted I should have sent it back to be cooked, then after some back and fourth one of his final comments was: I work in the food industry, I truly understand why you don't send your food back.   I paid the tab and mind you I did not penalize the server and still left a 18% tip for our party of 5 adults, it was not his fault the steak was cooked (or not cooked in this case) poorly and the manager was not helpful. Overall a bad first time experience and unless I am forced I will likely never return and suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible! The service is absalutly bad, my steak is never cooked like I like it, I order rare I get a medium well so I sent it back and the mgr got mad at me for sending it back, I get it back and it's well done, mind you it took a half hour to get my drinks and over an hour to get my order before sending my meal back, so when I got it back again it was barley med. rare, by this time I just ate it so I can get out of there. It took another half hour to get my tab. Never again will I go back there. Don't waste your money or time"}
{"text":"You can't beat the million dollar view of Phoenix!!!  And if you like steak, then you should give T-Bones Steak House  a go - especialy if you  want an authentic \"western\" atmosphere and are tired places like Rustler's Roost.    T-Bones serves up cowboy-style steaks or chicken, broiled over mesquite (usually outside on a giant grill).   They also recently added Salmon to the menu.  Other than that - there isn't a very wide selection.  All meals are served with salad bar, cowboy beans and the ever-present bread and butter. But mind you, the all-you-can-eat salad bar is basically lettuce = probably because REAL cowboys and cowgirls don't need a lot of selection (they've learned to appreciate the simple things in life). Side dishes include baked potato, or mashed potatoes.    Choose from beef cuts that include the immense 2-lb. porterhouse or a 'cowgirl'-sized 1-lb. T-bone steak. For the kids, there is a separate menu with choices of a strip steak, chicken or burger.    Don't expect a Ruth Chris' experience.  T-bones is low key -- litterally, cowboys ride up on their horses.  Or police from the academy stop by to have a burger (at least you'll feel safe).  I bring all my friends from out of town to T-Bones Steak House just for the experience.  Plus, have I mentioned the views?  You honestly can't get a better view and a nice steak dinner at a reasonable price.  And it's family friendly!  I give this a \"giddy-yup\" rating :)"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant for me, as it is within walking distance from my house. I really wish that I could give it a better review, but to be honest the best things about it are: 1) The View, 2) The Beer, and 3) The Burger. The view of downtown Phoenix is spectacular, especially at sunset and it's even better when sitting outside at the picnic tables. Unfortunately, the food is not worth the price - except the burger (if they get it cooked to your liking). For some reason, the cook there really struggles to get things off the grill before overcooking the food, especially when they are busy like Friday and Saturday nights. Order your beef 1-2 shades more red than you otherwise would. You can always have them cook it a little more, but it's hard to reverse the damage once done. I haven't had a problem with the chicken. The cowboy beans and the salad bar is a nice touch, which somewhat makes up for the prices."}
{"text":"Good basic steak done right don't go for the sides or table cloth tables go for great city views straight forward menu and some micro brew beer and you'll have a great meal and a good time.."}
{"text":"I have been to T-Bone Steak house 4 different times,  with different people each time the service was EXTREMELY slow!  The management doesn't seem concerned by the slowness.  Each time my family and friends have been there the wait was over an hour even if they ere not busy!  The worst part was I didn't see many people of color so I hope the slowness wasn't just to discourage a diverse clientele.  I did see people who were not brown get served before us, even people who showed up after us.   Weird, maybe coincidence, maybe - either way while the staff was pleasant the wait was extreme.  So, if you plan to go take a novel as a time filler while you wait for you meal!"}
{"text":"These guys need to step it up alot.  They've got the perfect location, and we were really excited to find it.  But what the heck, the salad bar was just average, the meat was ok.  This could have been an ever so wonderful experience, but instead, just so so.  We would go back again, if we found a real salad bar, and some more variety to the menu.  What's wrong with something fried, like zucchini, shrimp......"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the T-Bone.  We had a friend in town and thought we'd give it a try. We heard the view of the Valley was great and the food even better. What we found is a no-frills, classic cowboy restaurant. The tables are picnic style, with vinyl tablecloths. The menu is on the wall and basic, meat and a couple of sides. We had the t-bones and sirloin and they were excellent. Dinner comes with cowboy beans, bread and salad bar. You don't go there for the salad bar. It's as basic as the menu. What you do get is a great piece of meat, cooked to order, that is delicious!  If you are looking for a fine dining experience, probably not the place to go. If you are looking for good food at an honest price, you'll enjoy the experience as much as we did."}
{"text":"Steak; dry and as if chewing a piece of cardboard. Chicken; juicy and very good flavor. Bill; way too much money :( People are nice, but I would take mu business somewhere where I pay, probably the same but the food is better....the question is where?"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Had 6 in our group. 5 of us ordered steak. ALL steaks came out raw. Sent them back and two came back at the correct temp. The rest were overdone. Our server ignored us once the food was on the table. One manager was angry with us that we sent our food back twice and told us \"cooking is not an exact science\".  The other manager was at least apologetic but acted as if he was doing US a favor for not charging us for the uneaten steaks. Salad bar is small and doesn't have much to it. Don't waste your time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This Restaurants just kicks butt! When it comes to cooking steaks. I only been here a few times now since last month, and i became a returning customer :) Very nice atmosphere here, relaxing view and a great beer selection. The prices are lower than expected, Considering our meal/service."}
{"text":"We recently went back to the T-Bone Steakhouse after not going there in at least 1 year, and were happy to see that their steaks are just as good as we remembered. A lot of people complain about the service, but we were happy with it.  It looks like they changed management, so the service has improved. This is a down to earth, no frills steakhouse, so don't expect the 'white golve' service like at one of the fancier (and more expensive) places.   Other people also complain about the salad bar, which is very plain, it's true...but you should go to the T-Bone for the steaks, not the salad bar.  Their steaks are the best, tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. Their chicken is also very good.  Overall, we had a great experience at the T-Bone.  No complaints here.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place with a nice view of the city.  It's a rustic place \"ranch style\" with good steaks, beer, and ambiance. The filet mignon, homemade bread, and the beans are amazing! The only reason this doesn't have one more star is due to the salad bar.  The dinner included the salad bar and it was very plain. They did not have items such as cheese or any veggies that you typically see in a good salad bar. Other than that, this place is great."}
{"text":"Lovely view.  Very casual and extremely delicious food.  Last night was my first time here and I didn't know what to expect.  Very cowboyish. I had filet mignon and a brownie dessert which was the quality of Donovans but its definitely okay to wear jeans and a t shirt here. My steak was so tender and my brownie had a warm liquid filled center w vanilla ice cream on top! It was awesome!  There seemed to be alot of regulars.  The atmosphere was very friendly and laid back. There were couples drinking wine and families with children. Our waitress was Riley and she was so knowledgeable and sweet. We were there as the sunset and it was such a beautiful view.  There is a horse guided trail you can take from somewhere else to the restaurant and back. I forgot to get the info but I will definitely be calling back to do that. Great place to go if you want a great quality steak but don't feel like dressing up. :)"}
{"text":"This year the food and service was not up to par too say the least. Four out of six of us ordered steaks and all bout one was under cooked. One was sent back and she was brought another steak that was still way undercooked. The owner then brought out another steak and tried to say it was a fillet and there is absolutely NO WAY it was a fillet and it was now well done. I understand cooks don't like food sent back but the server suggested we order them medium rare and if it was to rare he'd have them cooked a little longer. As if that wasn't bad enough the person that ordered a hamburger said it was even tough. Needless to say we will not be eating at The T-Bone anymore!"}
{"text":"What a find! I've lived in the area for over 3 years and just heard about T-Bone Steakhouse. We went there on a Friday night around 8pm. I had the 24oz porterhouse and my wife had the pan fried trout..both of which were great. This place is my idea of a true western steak house. Rustic but yet comfortable. Simple food but yet delicious.   I even went back the following night with a buddy of mine to grab a couple of beers. This is when I learned that Friday night is the only time they grill out front on the open pit. That was the only downside."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate but the success of the T-Bone has really led to a decrease in the quality of service. I've gone there bi-monthly for years and it really has started a noticeable decline.   You can only hear the excuse that they got slammed unexpectedly and weren't staffed for it so many times before it becomes problematic.  If you get the waitress Heather, your meal will be correct and she will check back on you. You won't get the food promptly, but when it finally arrives it at least will be what you ordered. If you get another member of the wait staff.....good luck. It is sad to see."}
{"text":"What a waste of time! Went for Valentine's Day dinner, the waiter showed up once every twenty minutes. My $18 10oz. Steak was ordered medium and one side looked ok (which was up when they served it) but the bottom side was solid black char. So when I went to ask someone about it, since the waiter was nowhere to be found, I must have gotten the manager/owner. When I said \"who can I talk to about my burnt steak?\" He said \"I guess you can talk to me, but I don't know what I can do about it.\" Needless to say another 20 minutes later my next steak came out only about 5% less charred than the first, and the center was completely raw. I've bought grocery store steaks that were much better in quality, based on the few bites I could choke down. Got my sons burger order wrong, and got a few rolled eyes from the waiter whenever we asked for new drinks or to correct errors they made. Won't be coming back, definitely not worth the hour drive it took us to get there."}
{"text":"Steaks decreased in quality over the years, maybe they are using a different butcher or meat dealer now.  Nice place for a social meeting if you want to talk at length with a friend because the wait to get your order is very long.  I didn't mind the wait but others were complaining. The view is amazing and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here on a Monday night.  The place was packed,  Very few empty tables.  Night view of the city was gorgeous. Not a lot of selection on smaller steaks so settled on a 12 oz boneless ribeye,  The steak was one of the best I have ever eaten.  The flavor was great.  \"Salad Bar\" a little weak but the few items they had on the bar were fresh.  Paid $2.50 extra for baked potato.  Will definitely go back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"I went there about 4 weeks ago. The ribs fell off the bone! the best tasting ribs ive had in years. The steaks are bomb!! again I highly recommend this place, the wait is definitely worth it. The ribs are absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best steakhouse in Phoenix. My T Bone steak was good but everything else was very plain."}
{"text":"It's one of the best steakhouse! You get the true cowboy feel & great service. We've taken large groups for the last several years, & have had exceptional experiences each time."}
{"text":"So I'm here for my 6:30pm reservation and was told by a very unenthusiastic \"hostess\" that other people who have reservations are also waiting.  Apparently it doesn't matter if you called an hour and half ahead of time. After 20 mins we were seated when another staff was wondering out loud why there were 3-4 empty tables yet several parties standing waiting. Drinks came quickly and order taken.  About 30 mins from sitting to eating. Our waiter appears attentive but told us there was Apple pie for dessert then came back and said there was only brownies and ice cream for dessert. It seems that a busy restaurant would have more than one dessert choice readily available. Food was good. I decided to add a brownie dessert when I saw how good they looked. After about 15 mins of waiting I was told they were out.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!  The kid clearing tables was more attentive to whether we needed drinks or if we were still waiting for dessert. The filet was not worth coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers and we wanted a good steak.  I checked Yelp and found T-bone and we liked the reviews we saw so we set off In search of it.    First not knowing the area we had to get lost and asked directions from the wrong people two times.  We finally got to the right area and pasted it and found the deadend street.  We backtracked  1/2 a block and found a small signed tacked to a post saying T-Bone Steak House.  So it was off to the left of 19th before the deadend for people looking for it.  I like rustic places and this one looked cool with a very nice view of the city.  I ordered the 16oz T-Bone steak which also comes with the salad bar, & cowboy beans.  Went to get a salad while waiting for the steak and found the salad bar the smallest I have ever seen.  It was a large bowl of lettuce, small bowl of cheese (wasn't sure what it was at first, so dark) and croutons and three dressings.  Oh and a very large bowl of cold green beans with onion and a vinegar dressing on it.  Oh well we mainly came for a good steak right.  The steaks came and they were all also a disappointment, My 16oz T-Bone looked just like my friends 24oz porterhouse.  We had ordered medium rare and they were just Medium, bearly any pink, and not juice.  The bread looked like Texas toast that was not toasted.   I did eat all the steak and a salad but I was hungry, but wouldn't ever consider going back again.  Sorry but no I didn't enjoy it as much as the other reviewers."}
{"text":"My Father in Law brought us here because the food was supposed to be so good.  We were here for 1.5 hours, the food came out cold and overcooked.  The service was horrible.  We had to ask several times to get refills on water and as we were getting ready to leave, the server finally asked if I wanted more tea.  Never go here."}
{"text":"Went to T-bone for a round 2 to see if I order a rare still mooing steak if I'll get it & I did. YAY me!  I did order the redskin potatoes $1.99 & got a spoonfull of deliciousness. I only wish the size matched the price tag. Come on T-bone the side was small even to me. The waitress actually remembered us from the month before gotta love that. Thanks T-bone for cooking my steak rare still mooing. Definitely a fave of mine now."}
{"text":"Wow food was outstanding.   The servers and bar tender was friendly, great and amazing."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until about 6 years ago when I was working in the area.  Just never had the time to get up to it. I guess the time it took to get here, you really start to expect something special from a place that doesn't advertise. What's more- it's a Steakhouse so you would expect that to be a specialty. Prices are average for a \"good\" steakhouse, but this could not be classified as \"good\".  As soon as the steals arrived to the stable, you could tell the meat quality was not that great. Even the 8 oz filet that was cooked medium rare was tough to eat.  The ribs were ok...they presented well on the plate, but still not a great meat quality.  The salad bar was DEFINATELY not much of a bar and had basic, basic- lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes. The ranch was out as well.   The view is truly amazing. We sat by the window closest to the door and it was pretty breath taking. Even with the development around it, there is no finer view of our beautiful city.  I asked a lot of questions to learn about the history. The restaurant was once a house that was converted in the the 50's, so it has been here awhile. Well decorated and fun atmosphere. The tables are picnic tables and just symbolic of a simpler time.  To be honest, this place \"could\" be one of the greats. I won't be going back anytime soon which is sad because I love out of the way places that offer something different.  As a final note- the apple pie was awesome and truly home made. If you order, just ask them to heat it up as room temp pie is just not good!  I hate not being able to give this place 5 stars- but really no other choice and I think 3 is being generous!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with an 8 person party. Sat outside which was beautiful view but service was slow and our food came out after another table that sat after us. We did not get complimentary appetizers until after we received our food which took two hours as well as our drink order! We are not locals but we didn't know that it would count against us!! Don't recommend this for people who are not from the area. Food was ok at best!"}
{"text":"We've been to the T-Bone twice now. The first time was last winter. Service and food was great, but a little more expensive than you'd expect. Would have given it 4 stars back then.  Tonight's experience was much worse -- 2 stars at best. So I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and rating T-Bone an average of 3 stars.  Tonight I ordered their special, which was a bone-in ribeye for $24 (can't remember the size). I ordered it medium rare, but it came out medium well. I would have mentioned it to our server, but we didn't see her once after our food came until it was time for the bill because she was tending the bar.  In any case, the ribeye was ok, but my wife's baby-back ribs (the other available special) were better.  As others have said, the views are great and the atmosphere is unique (in a good way).  However, my biggest complaint is the value. Our total bill including tip came to $68, and we had no alcoholic beverages or dessert - just the entrees and two sides. One would think that at those prices, the side items would be included."}
{"text":"Took the Ponderosa Stables Horse Ride package thru the mountains and ended up at T Bone for dinner. Food was amazing. Everything you'd want from a Steakhouse. We had our kids with us and kids menu was perfect for them too! Service was great and food came out at a good average time. My steak was spot on, medium rare! Simply put, a great dinner spot in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great views, great service, good food. This is a really cool spot that is away from everything else. It's simple and fairly priced. I will be back again"}
{"text":"First off let me say that the view is phenomenal. However we didn't go for the view. We went for the food.   My wife had a ribeye and I had a dry aged New York Strip, bone in. The steaks were average, nothing special. They are also very pricey. For the amount of money we were charged I expected a top notch meal. That's not what it was, it was average.  My wife ribeye was very fatty. I expect some good marbling but this was way too much. It was cooked the way requested but again, not worth the cost.  My Strip was dry aged so I expected a really deep flavor. Again, average at best. I read a good deal of these reviews and several people raved about the cowboy beans. People said they had a nice \"kick\" to them. That could not be farther from the truth. They were absolutely bland. No flavor, no sweetness, no tang, nothing.   We had a side of corn on the cob and a baked potato and 3 beers between us. The grand total was over $70.00. I really expected a lot more.  Overall I probably will not go back. Not unless they line their prices up more to what they are serving. Average food at high prices."}
{"text":"First time we had been there. I really liked the atmosphere. Old West feel, which is neat. Food was excellent. Between the 4 of us, we had, ribs, chicken and steak combo, sirloin, and the salmon. Food was excellent and cooked perfectly.  I have 2 complaints, the seating is benches, which was very uncomfortable to us. Perhaps having the choice to have a chair would be good and the temperature was pretty warm inside.  We will return to this restaurant. Just hoping for better seating."}
{"text":"We live close to this place. I just finished reading several reviews for \"T-Bone\". I felt that it was important to put in my two cents. We have had one or two decent meals in the past (long ago). Not great, just okay. The food is over-priced for its low quality. The service is not good. The employees have an entitlement attitude and poor personalities. Your hard-earned money would be better spent going to Safeway and purchasing steaks to grille at home.  Dine-in sucks on the uncomfortable tables. Take-out is worse. Place your order over the phone. Come in to pick it up when instructed to. Ask 4-5 employees if you can pick up your order. Receive the deer in the headlights look from everyone until finally a manager yells into the kitchen. He tells you that your order is coming out soon. Wait 10-15 additional minutes to receive your order while paying way too much money for it.  I love to use local businesses, however, I am hoping that a successful corporate chain buys this place and runs it like a restaurant should be run or bulldoze this joint and build a nice coffee house.  As a neighbor of this place, I am embarrassed to have it close to my house. Our neighborhood is Awesome. T- Bone is not. Please do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Good quality steaks. Excellent service. Heather was our server. She did an excellent job. Steaks were cooked to perfection. They have Goose Island IPA on draft, beans are also good. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"This place was really busy when we were there.  The manager was very friendly and came over to check on my girlfriend and I, as well as the table next to us.  The salad bar was great, as was the beer and the service.  The bread tasted stale, the wait for our food was pretty lengthy, and the Ribeye was MUCHHHH better than the T-Bone steak.  Overall an OK experience.  We likely won't return."}
{"text":"Great View of the city lights in the evenings. The steaks are the best I have had. Homemade bread and cowboy beans. are good. Wish the salad bar was a little more extensive. We come here often."}
{"text":"Finally came here for the first time tonight as I have been wanting to try it for years!  The views, old school western vibe etc is really pretty cool.  I'm on a quest to find a really good Porterhouse Steak at a not so crazy price.  The one I had tonight wasn't anything to write home about, strongly lacking in flavor, and wasn't the quality cut of beef I was seeking.  I would most definitely come back, and try other offerings on the menu. Service was prompt and I was in and out in a very timely manner.  The star deductions are for the food and the waiter that insists on calling every guy at any given table boss...Not sure if that's just a nervous habit or his way of trying to be cool.  Not really that big of a deal just something he might want to slow up on.  All in all, a cool old spot that is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"very very nice place, we had the tbone steak and it was very good, the view from this restaurant is amazing.  you will love the service also. we had the tbone steak and bake potato and it was good. I would have gave 5 stars but the salad bar could be a little better if they just add cheese, eggs and maybe red onions and they would be A+ thats all missing in my opinion but everything else is good. I will recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go on a beautiful AZ evening. They have a wonderful deck to sit outside on and enjoy the sunset and Phx skyline.  We have always had great food and service. So relaxing, it's hard to leave."}
{"text":"Really great place and not a better spot to bring out of town guests for dinner! Steaks were cooked to perfection as was the trout. Good beans and bread. Service was great. Place was clean and atmosphere was fun. Good live music and a small bar. Plenty of seating outside or in. Can't believe I have never been here before. A true gem and we will be back! One of the best views in town!"}
{"text":"The steaks are great. The ambiance is great. The sides are extremely basic, comparable to cafeteria food. I would not recommend the corn, it seems as if it was frozen and then heated in the microwave."}
{"text":"A star for the view and one for the steak.  I was put off by the \"sides.\"  You had to pay extra for a baked potato or corn.  You get access to the \"salad bar,\" if you really want to call it that.  It was lettuce out of a bag, cucumbers, tomatoes, and cold green beans (out of a can.)  If you are going to charge me over $20 for a piece of meat, the least you guys could do is provide sides that are fresh and not bought from Costco.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to this rustic steakhouse twice and loved the steak both times.  The view of Phoenix is also beautiful.  The staff is very casual and down to earth.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants tasty, well-priced steak."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Our family loved it! We took a horseback ride to the Steakhouse from Ponderosa Stables. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"We took the horseback ride from South Ponderosa Stables with the restaurant as the destination.  As restaurants go, it was okay.  The salad bar is pretty unimaginative - I mean, you CAN do more that a bowl of lettuce and some bowl of dressing - and in fairness they did have green beans in a savory sauce, but it was pretty much water with little to enhance the beans.  My wife's cheeseburger was vary good and my boneless rib eye tasted great - except that it was fully half gristle and fat.  The sides were fine.  My drink order was screwed up (they brought the wrong brand) but I drank it anyway rather than complicate an already slow response time.  The pricing was quite reasonable for what we got and the atmosphere was kind of fun.  I definitely would come back again...on horseback."}
{"text":"We tried T-Bone recently after a desperate search for something decent to eat in our neck of the woods and we really enjoyed it. It was not very busy for a Saturday night, but that's Phoenix during the summer for you. This is when we locals get to take back our resorts and restaurants from the conventioneers and snowbirds.   Other reviewers are right on the money regarding the mediocre at best sides, and the outstanding steaks. Mesquite grilled to perfection, my t-bone was fabulous, but my husband's New York strip was even better. The cowboy beans were also very good, with a nice zippy spice to them. The \"salad bar\" had an iceberg mix and a canned green bean and red onion salad. My baked potato was just fine and came with no shortage of butter and sour cream.   The biggest surprise of the evening was the beer- they have their own microbrewery. My husband ordered the stout which was delicious even though it was on the sweet side. I had the pale ale and it was great. Our server, who was awesome, told us that the amber was the best. We'll be trying that next time.   The whole atmosphere of T-Bone's is casual, friendly, and comfortable. We enjoyed the unique view of Phoenix lit up at night in front of us complete with silhouetted saguaros and South Mountain right behind us. I can see us becoming regulars here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is the best!!! However, the food is what brings my rating way down. The salad bar is very small, not many choices. The steak was definitely not what my husband and I imagined it to be since this is a steakhouse, the t-bone steak was more the size of a breakfast steak, thin and small.  We also don't care for a la carte style menu.   We have given this place two chances, there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Beware of this place because they cannot tell when meat is spoiled. They served spoiled steak  and the manager did not know what to say.  The manager tried to blame the mesquite wood for the sour taste of the meat.  The manager needs to learn how spoiled food taste and smells.  I will not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday to taste test before our big dinner on Saturday night.  Service was great and the owner is awesome.  I had the boneless rib eye which was pretty decent.  Just wished their salad bar had more options though.  I loved their brownie!  Saturday night we had a very large group of about 60 people.  We sat outside which is a really cute picnic area with beautiful views of the city.  Everyone had a lovely time.  The food kept coming along with the drinks.  I have a new favorite tequila now because of our server.  It's Dobel. :-)  Thanks to him!    They even do horseback rides that start at the stables and end at the restaurant.  I've got to try that next time."}
{"text":"I rarely leave negative reviews but this experience is one of the worst I've ever had at a steak house. I've enjoyed steak houses in LA, Chicago, NY, Miami and now Phoenix and I have never waited an hour and a half for a 12 oz Ribeye. I felt sorry for the BarTendor who had to keep stalling.  My husband wanted to walk out. They desperately need new management.    So I was writing this as I was waiting for my food and now after that long wait I just noticed they didn't  even bring the beans ( not that I wanted them). Not worth mentioning but you would think that a good manager would know whats happening in their restaurant.  From one service manager to another"}
{"text":"Best ribs in Pheonix!!! We came for the Sirloin and Cheeseburger, both of which were amazing. Then we tried the rack of ribs with that [voodoo] sauce of goodness. That spice and tender combinations got out our tastebuds into overdrive with delight. Then came the home made apple pie and ice cream highly recommend this place. Officially our favorit in Phoenix and the staff are fantastic, which is a huge plus. Oh, did I mention the view?....yes!"}
{"text":"It was \"OK.\"  For the price (12oz Boneless Rib-eye for $19; 8oz Fillet Mignon for $20) it is fairly good.  The cuts of meat are not top-grade.  There was plenty of fatty tissue on the Rib-eye making it tasty but reducing the amount of meat to much less than 12oz.  The decor is relaxed: checkered, picnic-style table clothes; waitstaff in jeans; plastic 20oz cups for beverages.  If you want a high-grade steak and have money to spend, go to Donovan's.  If you want an average steak, you can come here."}
{"text":"Great view and ambiance. The food is excellent, the staff was courteous and professional. I took my girlfriend here for her first at sunset and she loved it. I recommend the apple pie with cinnamon swirl ice cream"}
{"text":"Another trip to T-Bone, this time with nine of us. We made reservations for seven o'clock on a Friday night and arrived right on time. There were about 1/2 tables empty.   Our extra large table was reserved so we were seated right away and, once again, Leon took care of us for the evening.   He did a really good job keeping up with our boisterous group, keeping all the orders straight and never dropping the ball. Everything came out just right.   I ordered one of the specials that night: dry aged New York Strip Steak. All entrées come with salad bar, cowboy beans and bread. Nothing has changed about the bland salad bar, unfortunately. Still a boring side. The beans and bread, tho good, are never great.   My steak was cooked just like I like it: medium rare. It had good flavor and I really enjoyed it. There was only one who didn't indulge into their full meal but she's like that.   Good food, excellent service and outstanding view. Is there anything else you want in a good dinner?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I thought the food was overpriced and the sides are a complete waste!!!  No one likes your mandatory crappy beans and bread.  Give people OPTIONS!    For almost $20, I ordered the steak/chicken dinner this past time.  I got one tiny chicken thigh and a piece of steak that resembled a chicken finger.  Terrible!  The salad bar was weak both times too.  The time before my 115lb gf left hungry after her $14 burger.  Both times we both have left this place hungry and $30-40 poorer!!!   The good:  It's in a great location and the food is tasty.  But it needs a complete menu overhaul.    More portions (i don't want to go home hungry)  Add more sides to choose from Free appetizers like most steak houses?!??  Peanuts, sweet bread, etc.."}
{"text":"Was here for a party before, and it was decent so I figured I've give it a try. Clearly my business wasn't wanted. Waited at the bar for over 10 minutes, 3 employees saw me sitting there and walked away. One said she'd be with me in a minute and never came back. Not even a second glimpse as I walked out."}
{"text":"Arrived Friday Night around 7 got our food about 8:30 ...steak was cold and over cooked, salmon was dry.   Service was barely there.    We ask the waitress if we could have some bread while we wait so she brought out bread and beans...not utensils or plate for the beans...we asked...can we have a plate and fork to eat the beans...she said..exact quote..\"Oh, you want plates too\"   nice view but we will never go back...this is actually our 2nd visit...our first visit was awful but we always give second chances"}
{"text":"Okay,  Well I have lived in Phoenix my whole life and this was the first time I visited this place. Needless to say I am not impressed. The chicken was great but the rest well very expensive and not that great. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was completely watered down. Not sure how but yeah. We ordered the filet and it was pretty dry. The ribs were dry and fell off the bone too easily. Other than that the bill was hella pricey.. The service was good it wasn't horrible. Would I go back? Probably not. Not for that price."}
{"text":"Wow! Such polarized reviews! Where to begin? Scenery is, as all have said, awesome. Incredible views. Salad bar is bare bones. Lettuce, cukes, tomatoes... it's a salad! Our waitress, Heather, was friendly and welcoming. Her love of her job and her bosses was almost contagious. I came close to asking for an application! Seriously though, she was great and the service was quick. I got the chicken/filet combo. I'll agree with some here that the steak can stand some seasoning but it did a pretty good job on it's own and was cooked properly. The chicken was delicious!!! My better half enjoyed the pork chops.  Beans were a bit bland and served in the same bowl that upset previous reviewers. Its a rustic cowboy-ish steak house. Not Ruth's Chris. If I'm sitting on a picnic bench for dinner, I won't be looking for fine China.  It was very reminiscent of the now shuttered Pinnacle Peak Patio and we discovered that the owners of T Bone are related to Pinnacle's owner! If I had to guess, their kitchen suffers when they get really busy. I know that doesn't excuse a poor dining experience though!  I'll definitely be returning. I just wish I had room for that pie a la  mode!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - check Food - check Experience riding here and back on a horse - double, triple check  My only criticism was the slow service.  They knew to expect us, but it took forever to take our order.  We had 4 tables outside and I ended up taking orders and handing them to the waitresses for 3 of the 4 tables.  They were sweet, but just not prepared enough for us.    However, the atmosphere was great with excellent desert views of Phoenix and the food was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Great service and okay food. The view is fantastic. I sitting by the window at dusk watching the planes land. I had the ribeye, my dining partner had a filet. Both were cooked exactly as requested and were good. Nothing to write home about. The salad bar is pretty bad-Iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and not much else. The backed potato was good but probably not worth the extra money. It'll be while til I go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives down the way from T-Bones. Since I fell in love with it on first sip on the the patio after a rough day at inflight training a few weeks back.. He decided to show me the full sizzle on a Thursday night last week. We got there earlier this time. We drove up with the top down on a beautiful Arizona desert evening. The place was seriously packed! It was actually hard to find a parking place. There was a wedding rehearsal dinner party going on out on the back area.. Fun to watch from our seat on the patio. We knew we wanted to have a glass of wine or a beer or two before having dinner and just catch up from our week of travels and business before ordering dinner. However, we ordered our drinks ... got our waters and the waiter just disappeared. Again, the place was packed and he had his hands full. Literally. This night seems to also be the 'trail ride' night. Where you can ride the trail and then have dinner here. I haven't done that. Maybe in the future. My boyfriend finally walked in after we waited a good 30 minutes for our drinks and found our waiter, who very apologetically, admitted to forgetting about us out there on the patio. Really it wasn't much of a worry. As we love the ambience and the sunset was pretty. Besides, there is a reason he and I are together... there is not a boring moment between us! (okay..roll eyes.. yep.. cheesy--ness to the maximum there).. He still takes his time to come back after our glasses go empty and re-up us and then take our order. Again.. we are pretty patient. But now we are hungry! I order the filet mignon petite steak, medium rare.. comes with a salad bar and bread. I opt for a baked potato, a splurge for me, on the side. My boyfriend gets the half chicken. I am not much on salad bars, as I usually think its less sophisticated than it should be for a nice restaurant, but I liked this one. Our meals came out in a timely fashion and we got another drink in a timely fashion, once all the trail riders were back on the trail and on their way. The waiter even sat down and offered up another apology. My steak was so good! I crave steak every now and then and its about the only red meat I eat .. and only rarely. Loved my boo's chicken. So yummy.. I kept eating it! I only bring my star down from 5 because I give the waiter that not the place itself. He sort of rushed for the check to be signed off so he could have a drink and told us that if our check was left open that he could not have a drink yet.. okay buddy.. We were so, so nice and patient with your lack luster service and NOW your pushing our nice buttons...Again .. I love this place and it's fast becoming a PHX fav for me."}
{"text":"My burger was good but my BF had an undercooked steak and it was $32.  He told the waiter but didn't do anything but say sorry.  Plus we were never really checked on.  I think it may be because gratuity was automatically added since we had a large group.  Atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"This is my second review of T-Bone Steakhouse. The first visit was for take-out steak late one Saturday night a few months back.  This time, I took hubbie with me (it was for my birthday) and we dined IN.    This time, they had the 40 oz Porterhouse (for 2) on SALE for $40, so we ordered that.  It was thick and perfectly cooked.  We overheard some other patrons complaining about how spicy the beans were, which they are kinda spicy.  The salad was fresh, but still sadly lacking in toppings.  Since it was muh' birthday, I asked for a special deal (it never hurts to ask), so they agreed to give me a free dessert, which was strawberry cheesecake!  The VIBE there is very casual and comforting, and I enjoyed the selection of country music in the background:  A Little Past Little Rock, Don't Take The Girl, I'd Sure Hate to Break Down Here, and Poor Poor Pitiful Me, etc.  Hubbie, who is more the Grateful Dead type, seemed to actually be enjoying the country music.  I suggested we get him a cowboy hat for next time and he seemed to entertain the idea...  We were pleasantly surprised to enjoy the city view at night from our table and the service was fine.  I suggested to our server that they do an ad for a temporary special wherein if a patron displays a used movie ticket stub from \"True Grit\" they can get a discount on food that night.  He said he'd tell the manager.  I think it would be a great place to eat dinner immediately after seeing True Grit!  Evidently the restaurant backs right up to the South Mountain Park and someone said you can rent a horse to go horseback riding at the park, then pull right up to the back of the restaurant and eat breakfast or dinner.  The South Mountain hiking trails are also right next to the restaurant, so you can actually go hiking right after a meal if the park is open!  Hubbie is pretty particular and doesn't hold back criticism if he has any, and I think he actually liked this place.  He said he'd go there again!  UPDATE:  November 2012:  Have tried other steakhouses and T-Bone Steakhouse STILL cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The atmosphere is cowboy charming with a spectacular sunset and city view. The ribs were some of the best we ever tried!"}
{"text":"Well. First, not much to say. It's the only steak spot in south Phoenix. Expect a big steak! Which is nothing to complain about but if you want flavor, don't go. I've been here a few times to give it more than one try and this visit I had the sirloin, my husband the Tbone, & 4 year old the grilled chicken. Maybe it's nice because it's convenient to where we live, the view is beautiful & its spacious if you need to host an event. The steaks were super bland & chewy. I put salt, black pepper, And steak sauce (A1). When you're Hangry you'll eat anything so it's definitely not our first choice. Too bad because we Do try to support local over chain, but this time it made us regret not driving elsewhere. It's just too expensive for such a bland experience."}
{"text":"This was even more than what other  reviews had said about it. The melt in your mouth porterhouse was unbelievable. Jamie,  my server was very attentive. And I believe Kevin the manager / owner? Was also very attentive. I will come back here even without the trail ride. Food and service is amazing"}
{"text":"I would definitely say this is just an 'ok' place. I really wanted some bbq chicken and steak and saw they had a combo on the menu. They have an old school salad bar for your starter salad and it was pretty cleared out, so it was just basic lettuce and some dressing. Not a huge deal, but I was really hangry at this point. My chicken was ok, but the steak was overcooked so much it was tough to eat. It was way too busy to get it made again and I was hungry.. sooooo I just ate it. I don't know if I would try this place again, it was very basic. However, there is a very beautiful view of Phoenix from the patio, even nicer with good weather.   btw. the bread comes out with the food so eat the salad"}
{"text":"Don't pay attention to the snob reviewers. No, it's not the best steak in Phoenix. If you have to have the best of everything everywhere you go then that says all we need to know about you. If it's busy,  you're going to wait.  We call that \"science\".  I really liked my steaks each time I have eaten here. Last trip I spotted someone eating some really good looking ribs. I'll have to try those next time. Come for a decent steak,  a good meal,  interesting atmosphere and a great view at night."}
{"text":"T-bone steakhouse is a little hidden gem tucked near South Mountain in South Phoenix. We would have never gone to this place had it not been recommended by a friend. The ambiance takes you back to old Texas. My parents and I were taken aback by the many cars parked and yet we were seated by the hostess instantly and greeted by the waitress and the breathtaking view of the valley. There was a lovely live country music band performing. After ordering we went straight for the salad bar which comes with every entree. Super simple bar, nothing special. I'd be darned if the ingredients were homemade. It's not worth indulging in the salad bar, better to save room. The bread and beans came out next. I don't care for beans but I have to say their bread was my favorite part of the meal. SO nice and fluffy. Bread lovers will delight in theirs. The entrees came out within about 15 minutes which was great timing in my book. I ordered the grilled salmon with a side of corn. It was grilled to perfection but lacked a bit of flavor. The lemons helped. The corn wasn't too flavorful at all, I would skip it. I tried my mom's ribeye which was phenomenal. The taste was great and it was cooked exactly how she asked with a little pink. My dad's ribs were also so good. Meat fell right off the bone. The bbq sauce it comes with, I'm hoping is homemade but enhances the meat so well. We did save room for dessert but I was a tiny bit disappointed with how dry their bread pudding was. Once the ice cream melted in it, it was better. Overall, T-bone steakhouse is very lovely and satisfying. Seeing that it is right around the corner, we like it enough to return. Prices are fair, staff is pleasant. A good family dinner place."}
{"text":"We did the night horse ride from Ponderosa stables which was great. The ride is to T-Bone Steakhouse for dinner and back. After looking at the web-site and Yelp our expectations were for a basic no-frills steakhouse. Wife and daughter ordered small filets and I was going to order their special, a bone-in filet, but the waitress recommended the bone-in ribeye. My favorite cuts are ribeye and filet, in that order, so I went with the ribeye. What a mistake! It was way over cooked (ordered med-rare but got well) and it was very tough, and tasted of gas. Wife and daughter said filets were okay and cooked close enough. Waitress only came back to offer dessert and the check and said \"sorry\" about my ribeye, and to \"give them another try\"."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 Saturday night. This was my first time there. I will start by saying the view was great. The service was very good! The steak on the other hand was not. I ordered a special 14 ounce filet for $30, Very good value I thought as Mastro's would have charged $60 for this. Was ordered medium rare, was served med well. Server and owner apologized and had another fired up. Now the chef was probably gun shy so the second was served rare, so much so that the center was cold. I said I would just eat it but after a couple of bites I decided to have it cooked to med rare as ordered. Was brought out again slightly better than before. I ate around the edges and left the rest. Once again I'll state that the service and attention to this was top notch. Problem is if you have a very thick steak as a special, your kitchen should be able to cook it as requested, especially being a steakhouse! At the end of the meal nothing was offered for the inconvenience. I will say that there were only 2 problems at our table, the other being a steak ordered med well and being served med rare. Maybe the kitchen mixed up the tickets. We will try this place again and hope the food equals the view and service."}
{"text":"Live just down the street and after a hard week just thought a beer and a steak sounded good.  I decided to sit at the bar and be considerate so others could have a table.  After sitting at the bar for more than 10 min some finally took pity on me and asked if I need something to drink.  As i sat their and watched customers come in sit down and then their dinners come I decided have no chance of getting another beer let alone dinner I just gave up a flagged someone down to get the check.  As I was leaving I was told to have a good night...not after that kind of service.  I replied I just wanted to get something to eat...shook my head and left.  I did write YELP on the receipt so if someone their cares maybe they can address it with the staff."}
{"text":"There are times when I think my Yelp presence is needed (well, need is a strong word) and there are times when I'm just basically saying \"me too.\" Other people have done a fine job with the T-Bone reviews so I'm just writing because I like to opine.  My favorite subplot here is the salad bar debate. Yes, this is well below average in the popular metric VORSB, value over replacement salad bar. The purpose here is to get a little bit of cucumber to feel less guilt about the meat you're about to enjoy.  We can agree that there are better salads in the world, but T-Bone offers beautiful mesquite-grilled steaks. I got the bone-in ribeye, an excellent piece of meat perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cowboy beans and the bread are strongly recommended.  The setting is a fascinating location at the edge of South Mountain with a nice view of Phoenix. Someone described it as rural. I didn't know if that was possible given that Lowe's and Starbucks are around two miles away but now I understand."}
{"text":"I have had to change my review from 5 to 2 because the last few times I have gone my steak has not been cooked correctly. It is disappointing, but this place is still ok for the view."}
{"text":"This place is at the base of south mountain. This restaurant has a great ambiance and fabulous views of the mountain and the city. Our waiter, Raymond was excellent and very attentive.   My husband and I ordered the trout since it was recommended and popular. He said it was wild caught and shipped from Norway or \"something\", don't think so. Anyway, all the dishes come with unlimited salad bar (very minimal selection) and baked beans for the table. Everyone else is al a carte; corn on the cob, baked or mashed potatoes. My fish was way too salty and my husband's was too fishy. Another person in our group said his filet mignon was not very good.   We loved the rustic, cowboy atmosphere and the friendly staff, but we were not too crazy about the food.   Although we are glad we got to try out a new place! Sounds like this place has been around for along time! Hope they up the menu a bit and have a better selection next time.  Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"absolutely awful service.  1 steak was over cooked and one was undercooked.  when the waitress came to the table all she could do was get the manager.  when we told the manager what happened she insisted the undercooked steak be put back on the girl and cooked to the desired way even though the steak had been cold since about 15 minutes already passed by the time the waitress came back and then the manager.  very embarrassing to host friends and have them pay for something which had to be reheated and recooked which caused it to be tough as rubber, dry and uneatable.  there was no where to go as far as management to get this cooked properly since she had already refused to get a new steak.  then they had the audacity to charge for their mistake and their uneatable steak.  so half the table ate, then one person ate, and then another person ate so we had 3 different main courses served at three different times.  ******with this standard, i will not eat here ever again,.****  if they do not respond it will just prove the i do not care what you think i am the manager and you are the customer and what i say goes attitude we were presented with.  there are so many other places to eat in phoenix and alot closer so if they do not need our business we will no longer patronize them!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the last few originals in Phoenix, dating back to the 1920's. Its a no-nonsense steak house serving up some of the best steaks in town, and at half the price as places like Mortons, Maestros or Harris.  If you like beef and a cold beer, mosey on in for one of the best views in Phoenix from an old ranch house.  I've never been disappointed here.  Well, one time, when I got so drunk my date left me in the parking lot and drove off with my jeep.  She did call me the next day to tell me where I could pick it up, so it wasn't all bad.  Bitch."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for quite some time, and finally made it to T-Bone.  Best steak and chicken we have had in a long time.  We certainly will be back again! The service was great and the view, well spectacular!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with a large crowd just past 9 on Sunday and was told cook wasn't willing to cook even though I was bringing in a big party and paying cash. Sad to know this establishment is willing to turn down a long time customer with a crowd and let us go hungry. Extremely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is an OK steakhouse.   Had an overall pleasant experience in terms of service. However was not impressed with the steak.  I tried the filet mignon and the top sirloin. Both were perfectly cooked to order, but overall lacking any real seasoning/flavor.  Bottom line: Steak was good, but not amazing.  I do recommend the mashed potatoes and their apple pie a la mode.  Pros: Lovely view of Phoenix in evening Great service Simple menu"}
{"text":"Good basic steak. Cooked the way I asked and perfectly seasoned. I had a T-bone. Hubby had a sirloin. His was a bit toigh.  Not fancy. Just good steak. When you need MEAT."}
{"text":"T Bone Steakhouse is a very cute, rustic place to have dinner.  The filet was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service from friendly staff. Delicious steaks at a very affordable price. Best bang-for-the-buck I've had in years. A must if you're in need of a good steak."}
{"text":"Still the best simple steak dinner with a view!!! This time we go a sweet waiter that was very attentive and even accommodated us by bringing out extra plate and providing matches and a cakecutter for our birthday celebration. Thanks T-BONE for cooking the best Porterhouse and chops!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! always have a good time at this place with great food / service is wonderful. Cannot go wrong comming to this place. Best keep secret for locals for decades."}
{"text":"In from Milwaukee and out to dinner with a large group of clients.  Sorry thiswas nothing to write home about.  Service is slow and the tall guy keeps coming around to take drink orders after our waitress does. I don't think they have a lot of large groups come in.  Had a porterhouse, it was tuff and stringy but then again I have never been a fan of the porterhouse.  Cowboy beans could use some flavor, maybe Tex-Mex.  It is a charming place, but I would make a special trip.  If you are ever in Milwaukee and want a good steak, try Eddie Martin's."}
{"text":"Okay this place is pretty weird. It isn't fancy but the view is! They brought out my filet on a plastic plate and all of the seating is picnic style. Pretty sure that every dish is served with a side of beans that likely come from a can. The salad bar is just sad. However, if you live in south Phoenix around this place, your choice in restaurants is severely limited so this isn't the worst you could do. The view is amazing and something to check out. The food is just bleh. Service was 8/10."}
{"text":"STILL haven't heard from manager Kevin.  Will keep experience short.  Planned a surprise party for friend, we all work in the area.   34 RSVPd and 42 showed.   I got there early to decorate, 6/30 event date.  That night's manager greeted me and gave me choice of area.  Tables were set for 6 but only fit 4 comfortably.  Eyes rolled when I mentioned this, was told these were designated for us.  When more showed up, as often happens, better more, than less, I was told we could not overflow to empty tables.  Are you kidding me! Treat them as walk-ins and take their order.   One waitress commented, \"That's why I hate working these events.\"    I thought the objective was to work for tips with good service.  When one person finally got waitresses attention, \"You want another one ?\"(beer) she'd had only one.  I could go on and on, but don't want to get irritated again.  AND an 18% gratuity was was added to everyone's bill. Many had to wait unreasonably long for food and service and felt gratuity too much.  I never sat down as I was trying to keep folks calm and happy.  The food was fair, nothing special.  I plan work gatherings often in the area, last one here.   Many of the guests live nearby and said they would not return.   South Phx. has many choices now, will book with them.  I called Kevin several times prior to event to make sure all was in order.  I've yet to hear back from him after event.  I've even emailed him on website saying, perhaps he'd like to call for feedback before I Yelped.   Crickets.    May be okay for a group of 4, not able to handle a large group.   Bartender started waiting tables and was very rude.   Need a steak house?   I've used Rustler's Rooste for 45 and have only compliments.   Yeah, my event was T-Boned, crashed with Terrible service.      Update 7/12.  Kevin called me yesterday to see why I was not happy.   I reiterated issues.   He said if others were unhappy they would have called.   I explained I told guests I'd handle the feedback.  Basically, he called me a liar.   He IS now getting calls from customers.  Arrogant manager!    This is the first time I've had someone so rude in a manager position and I host lots of events. Their loss."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I will say that it is not the cheapest steak house by any means but considering what you get, it is well worth it. As others have said, the view is amazing. Since it is situated south of Phoenix, it offers a unique view of a big part of the valley, with all the downtown skyline (what there is of it) all lit up at night. It's quite impressive to see from this vantage point.  My girlfriend wanted to treat her friend to a birthday dinner and T-Bone's was his choice. Everyone raves about Durant's and seeing as how she worked there for about 3 years, she's got a pretty good idea of what's what. She prefers T-Bone's for the value, among other things. She got the filet, her friend got the porterhouse and I got the NY strip. The birthday boy really enjoyed his porterhouse-all of it. I thought my strip was just so-so. It was cooked just as specified (the best part was the crispy searing on the outside and the inside was just perfect). I just wasn't blown away by the flavor or the cut. The winner of it all was definitely the filet. She ordered it medium rare, and although i prefer it cooked a little more, maybe medium, it was just perfect. The outside was crispy and when you put it in your mouth it almost melted just like butter. Incredible.  We followed it up with a slice of apple pie a la mode and some kind of brownie dessert. They were both very decadent.  I like this place because it offers a unique view of the valley, because of the overall quality of the food and because of the rustic feel of it all. I was surprised to see that on a Friday it wasn't completely packed out at 7 p.m. but there was a steady flow of meat lovers.  There is a full bar toward the back that is actually more lit up than the dining area. Fatty steaks freaks me out and for anyone else that has this same weird problem, the lack of lighting can make it difficult to be sure that you've trimmed off every morsel of fat from the steak. However, I gotta say I like how low lit this joint is, what with the saw dust on the floor and all.  I will absolutely be returning as soon as I can and this time I will be ordering the filet."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times !!! I always leave happy and full I love the simple ness of the restaurant. Usually order the ribeye or the ribs both are great."}
{"text":"The only place to get a steak in the Phoenix area. Up on the side of south mountain. Great view of the city. Rustic look with a western feel without looking hokey. The steaks are amazing and the prices are very good for the quality."}
{"text":"Cute ranch style atmosphere. Very friendly waitress  who was very busy. Live entertainment was fun. Salad bar was the smallest I've ever seen. They should just pre-make salads for customers. Butter packs for bread and potato were practically frozen. Filet was $23, not cooked to order and was not a quality piece of meat.  Same with the ribeye. I would not re-visit unless it was just for the atmosphere and to have a drink.  Beers were $3.75 each."}
{"text":"Yuck, was hoping for good food so close by but once was enough. This place is not for foodies let alone for people who have even few taste buds left."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good old fashioned backyard steak joint that keeps everything simple and provides a nice evening view, this could be your kind of place. I stopped in one night with some friends after an evening of gun range shooting and left a little fatter. :)   As mentioned, things here are kept simple but just right/enough.  From the tables to the salad bar, do not expect a lot, but what you get is just enough. Each meal comes with salad bar, bread, and I believe one side. The real winner here is the meat. From chicken to steak, you can not go wrong. I have been here twice and the steak is always very good. Just good old chuck wagon grub.  The setting is great, especially in the evening. With the place located perched on south mountain, you get great views of the city at night while kicking back and enjoying a simple meal. The staff here are very outgoing but again, with the place being a relaxed atmosphere be prepared that service may be a little slow. Both times here, I was never in a hurry and enjoyed the visit.   If you are looking for a change from the fast paced, loud, city dining experience, give T Bone a try."}
{"text":"Decent but average non-chain steakhouse. Steaks were pretty good - try to save some room for dessert. We had the brownie since they sold out of bread pudding, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We've been to T-Bone about a dozen times in the past couple of years.  It's one of our favorites for a place to have a fantastic view, a cold beer, and a great steak!  The picnic tables are not my favorite, but it works in this setting.  Went recently went on the Ponderosa Stables steakhouse ride -- I think it was just too many people for the kitchen and my steak was not up to par as usual.  But overall, we would highly recommend this place for a relaxed evening of simple cowboy dining.  In fact, was looking on Yelp for somewhere to eat tonight and now we're going T-Bone!"}
{"text":"This was the end of our trail on the night we did the steak dinner horseback ride from Ponderosas stables. Could not be more pleased.  Our large group and several other large groups were taken care of in a professional manner.  Attention was paid to us and we lacked for nothing.  This was our first time here and we left for the tril ride home, satisfied and full  Baby Back ribs were the special and most ordered those.  True to the word of our hostess, the meat came right off the bone.  Great view of the valley and city lights too.  I rarely order these when out as I am usually dissapointed.  NOT the case here.  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You to everyone!"}
{"text":"Come get a damn good steak in the hills below South Mountain. Reasonably priced, with beautiful views looking north to Phoenix and a relaxing, retro ambience, this is a gem. Imagine Rustler's Roost with better food and less tourists. The salad bar was basic, is about the worst thing I can say. I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Coming home from a movie I searched Yelp for somewhere new to try..  Like other reviewers said, this was near my house and I had no idea it was there.  My husband and I shared a 24oz Porterhouse steak for $24.  It was plenty for both of us and DELISH! We added a baked potatoes and it came with salad bar, cowboy beans, and bread.  It was an extra $4 for splitting the steak for me to get the sides as well.   We sat on the patio watching the sun go down and enjoying the beautiful view.  While we were there, a group came in on horseback.  You can ride from the Ponderosa, have dinner, and ride back.  We might try that another time.  There is a huge side patio that would make a great site for a dance or reception."}
{"text":"We have gone here for years & the food has always been good but today we received the worst customer service ever. 3 different waitress pased us numerous times. Two waitress even looked at us as they passed us by. We sat in a corner for over 30 minutes without even being offered a glass of water. This will be the first time in my life I have walked out of a restaurant without eating first."}
{"text":"I love steak.  Was in Scottsdale for work and tried to find a steakhouse at the last minute.  Spencers, Ruth, etc. were all full and couldn't seat us until 9p.m.  Yelp led us here.  Very nice drive from Scottsdale.  Very nice view of the city.  The place too was busy and got a table around 8:30.  Ordered the Rib Eye Medium Rare.  Took a long time to come.  Place wasn't really that busy when we were seated.  Figure 4-5 minutes per side to cook...took about 50 minutes for the food.  Medium Rare was really Medium Well.  Okay flavor.  Wait staff friendly.  Overall, should have taken the 9 p.m. at Flemings."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Me and my daughter came here on a horseback tour at Ponderosa Stables for my 40th bday. I ordered the Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection! Way to go. Courtney, our waitress was super friendly and sweet. Food was great. Ambience was really nice and warm after a cold horse ride! I would definitely recommend this place from casual to romantic. Thank you for being an amazing waitress Courney! You know what you did."}
{"text":"When you walk up the smell is beautiful. As you turn around you can see the beautiful lights of the valley with cactus appearing here & there. That is where the excitement of here ends. Walk in the front door and figure out it is. Dry country and down home like, which is fine. I had a sirloin son had a rib eye and husband ordered a NY strip but got a sirloin.  Meal included salad bar which consists of lettuce tomato cucumber some dressings and croutons and then cowboy beans.  Everything else is a la carte. My sirloin lacked flavor had to use A1.  Ordered 2 Long Island ice teas and one was much sweeter then the other an neither did the trick . This is a no go for me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the only remaining authentic cowboy steakhouse left in the valley. T bone is very tasty. The Cowboy beans are delicious and the salad bar has the best very cold  crunchy romaine. Nothing fancy, just good old ranch style cooking. The view is awesome!  And the coffee is delicious! Best I have ever had in a restaurant!  If you are a coffee drinker, be sure to get a cup! Marsha Dobson"}
{"text":"Steaks are fantastic, the chicken was completely melt in your mouth. Salmon was very delicious as well, they have an amazing grill. However, the environment really needs work, it's not a steakhouse environment. Was disappointed with the bread, it was not freshly baked, it was literally whole wheat Texas sliced bread from the store."}
{"text":"Our family loves meat!  That being said we know our meat.  We searched online for local steakhouses and found this place and read some reviews and thought we give it a try.  Locating the restaurant at night was a little difficult but what's wrong with a little adventure before dinner.  The ambiance was down to earth feel good kinda place.  Although the menu was very limited we didn't mind because we wanted our meat.  The family ordered T-bone medium well and it was overcook and dry.  Filet medium well and was tasteless.  Combo (steak & chicken) and the steak was decent but the chicken was dang good!  Top sirlon medium rare and it was juicy with little taste.  Though the salad bar was small we didn't mind.  We never saw our server because she kept going back to the bar.  When we asked the other servers for help they were great.  The only reason why I would go back is to try the cheeseburger and grilled salmon.  The view was awesome!  The food was average and over priced."}
{"text":"To start, the food was mediocre, which would have been acceptable, even with the ridiculous prices because I was having such a wonderful time with my family and the view was amazing.  Then my niece attempted to apply ketchup to her plate. It was immediately obvious to me this bottle of ketchup had been left in the hot sun and had become fermented. When she unscrewed the cap, immediately exploded unloading the entire bottle all over the both of us.  I caught the closest serving staff that I could hail down and told him we needed clean damp towels and an apology promptly. I did t see him again.  Our server came by, slapped a stack of paper napkins in the table and went on about her business never even asking if we were good. We were covered in fermented ketchup, covered!  As she was walking off to see another table I yelled after her that this wasn't in any way acceptable. She came back to our table, never asking what the problem was and told me with an attitude, \"it's not my fault, what do you want me to do about it?\"  She continued to argue, never offering any solution, compensation or accountability. She finally asked if I wanted the manager. I said yes of course, immediately.  The manager came to our table with a glass of soda water and a clean towel. My niece at this point was in the bathroom washing herself and throwing her shirt away. It was beyond saving and we had to ride horses for 1.5 hours to get home. My daughter lent her a completely sheer top she was wearing as an overlay, just to get home. I sent them in to find her to see if they could help her at all. She told them it felt like her skin was burning and this same server that for some amazing reason has a job responded with \"it's just ketchup\".   The manager felt like his soda water was reasonable compensation for our awful experience and did not offer to comp our meal. I told him that I would rather send my food back and have no dinner than spend a dollar in his restaurant.   After arguing with me about this back and forth, he finally handed my plate of food back and told me it would be on the house. At this point we attempted to get back to our meal. The bottle of fermented ketchup was still sitting on the table. The manager returns and asks if we need any more BBQ. I tell him my niece would still like to have some safe ketchup for her dinner. They still charged us $35 for my daughters plate and the half of the meal my aunt was sharing with my niece. Unbelievable!  While we were waiting to pay, a group of diners at a nearby table that were so over-served that they had become completely belligerent we're yelling things like get that f***ing n****r out of here. The manager shows up to deliver our bill and I tell him what is happening and that we are a mixed family and the kids are super uncomfortable. He tells me, yes I know we are working on getting him out of here. They actually processed his bill in the same slow fashion they processed everyone else out of the restaurant. No urgency what so ever. This restaurant cares not for any of their clients. They will take your money, slap a plate in front of you and tell you to go to hell if it's not safe to eat. My next step is to call the health department. If the ketchup is rotten, I can't imagine what is going on in that kitchen."}
{"text":"This is our favorite steakhouse in Phoenix. The steaks are amazing. The ribs are amazing. The service is first rate. The owner is a great guy and really cares about his customers. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ahh, the good old T-Bone Steakhouse.   I've been dining here on and off for 7 or 8 years.  Perched on the north slope of South Mountain, the location provides the best view one can get in South Phoenix.  Sunsets are delightful up here, inside the spacious old west cowboy dining room, or on the long patio now cooled with a robust misting system for those hot summer evenings.    I've stopped in many times for those random \"I feel like going out for dinner tonight\" meals, a few date nights, a few \"just drinks at sunset\" nights and even a few 4th of July evenings, because you can see several fireworks shows taking place around the valley.    They are the sister restaurant of the historic and famed, but now closed, Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse, which my dad had his tie cut off at while on a business trip to Phoenix some time during the 70's or 80's.     My wife and I took a group of friends up to T-Bones a few weeks ago for my first visit in awhile.  We sat on the patio and had a grand time.  I had a full rack of ribs, which I've been told were on \"special\" every time I've eaten here as far back as I can recall.  Just put them on the menu, guys!   Change up the specials a little!  Honestly, I've had the ribs when they have been amazing, and also when they have been not so amazing.  This time they were OK.   Weirdly, half the rack was great, and the other half was tough as nails to the point I couldn't eat it, and it was literally right in the middle of the rack where it went from good to not good.  I don't really understand how this is possible.  T-Bones makes it's own bbq sauce which is very tasty and really compliments the meat.  As usual, the salad bar was awesome, as were all the sides and the massive slices of garlic bread we ordered, and the service was great.  My favorite thing on their menu is still the smoked chicken.  Every time I have had it it has been delicious.    I'll still keep going back ;)"}
{"text":"Meat OK, view stunning. Owners need to check out Phoenix's Top Ten Steakhouse's and rethink sides, salads and level of passion. Who there cares about the food? Add an intriguing drinks menu, have a real salad bar, and sides that will deliciously speed the red meat through guests colon's and dominate Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my porterhouse or salmon with evening skyline views and intimate ambiance.  Simple, country restaurant feel.  Great food, friendly service, at a reasonable price.  I'd love a broader desert selection."}
{"text":"Food was good but for the price you pay you should get more the just beans and a bowl of lettuce with salad dressing. I wont be returning. Went on mothers day and wasn't even busy and the service sucked as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to love this place because it is one of the few local (non-chain) dinner restaurants in the South Mountain area.  Unfortunately, we won't be back.  The service was really lacking.  We went on a slow night, but our waitress was rarely seen.  The salad bar is nothing more than bagged lettuce with shredded carrots, cold canned green beans with sliced raw onions, sliced cucumbers, several different types of dressing, and bagged/premade croutons.  My husband ordered the RibEye. I ordered the \"special\" Prime T-Bone.   We never received our bread or our beans.  Both baked potatoes were so underdone they were inedible (the very vocal gentleman at the table next to us had the same issue, apparently).  The steaks had NO salt or pepper.   This place has huge potential.  It's really cute, rustic, with a great view.  But the food is just terrible.  Salt and Pepper costs so little, as would a few extra items on the salad bar.  Really a shame! :("}
{"text":"Very disappointing! T-Bone Steakhouse, so ordered a T -Bone. Poor, poor quality. Salad bar is a joke and beans were at best okay. The bread was decent and service was fine. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time getting a cheeseburger here. It was great. Got waited on by Heather who is a delight. For a small Phoenix country restaurant, T-Bone is a nice respite from the cookie cutter chains and high end snob shops. Don't expect high class and don't come if you're expecting cloth napkins and padded comfie chairs.  It's a rustic steakhouse with picnic tables and benches."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has repeat customers. Picture this - a Sonny's but twice the price and they serve steaks. If the prices were more reasonable this review would be 4 stars. I went in and looking around at the decor, I kept an open mind thinking, \"the steaks must be really good.\" Every table is a picnic table so if you have any back pain you aren't going to want to stay long. They served us cold bread with a pile of individually wrapped butters. Wow, attempting to spread that butter was frustrating. I ended up halting  each piece of butter and just placing it on different sides of the bread. Terrible - how do they expect us to spread cold blocks of butter on cold bread? Salad bar - a joke. Sonnys beats them here. It's a bowl of lettuce, a bowl of cucumbers, and a bowl of tomatoes. The beans weren't great, the sauce was watery and it mostly tasted like beans with a little spice. Finally, the steak. It came and was very charred on the outside, not appetizing looking. I cut into it, (we ordered medium rare), straight red! Looked like the cow could still be breathing. Also the waitress didn't stick around to see how we liked the steak, which is customary in good steak restaurants, so we had to flag her down to get this steak sent back. It comes back a few minutes later and it's much better, but now completely black on the outside. The charred flavor overwhelmed any good steak flavor. This is the only time I've ever reached for A1 for steak."}
{"text":"Husband, friend and I were out cruisin' the streets, trying to figure out where to go for dinner. We saw Bill Johnson's on 19th Ave/Bell Rd and thought \"mmmmm...steak sounds good.\" I checked out their Yelp and decided, \"eh...let's see what else I can find on Yelp.\" T-Bone popped up under steakhouses, reviews seemed good, we'd never heard of the place, we were already on 19th Ave, so I said \"keep driving straight, jeeves (my dear hubby, hah)! All the way to South Mountain!\"   We arrived at near-sunset. There were a few cars outside and just a few tables filled. It was kinda dark inside, but that's okay. The view was great, but it was a smoggy hazy day, so not so pretty. The menu consists of steak, steak and steak, plus a couple other meats and sides. Each entree comes with cowboy beans, bread, and the salad bar. Beans were beans. Bread was a slice from a loaf of wheat. Salad bar was bare, but decent. The cold green beans with onion & vinegar were...odd. Not terrible, but I don't fancy strong raw onions too much.  The three of us each ordered a different steak, each to a different doneness. Husband's & friend's were fine, but my medium-well was more medium-rare, so it was sent back to be corrected. I'm sorry, I grew up on well-done meats, so my foray into lesser cooked meats is taking some time. But it was okay, I don't throw hissy fits about incorrect orders, so I waited patiently for my cow to cook. I don't remember exactly which cut I ordered, but it didn't have a bone. It was a little tough and fatty, but I don't know much about steaks - maybe it was supposed to be that way? Good nonetheless. Husband's porterhouse & friend's whatever-he-got were good to them, also. Friend ordered a micro-brew. Blonde? Amber? I don't know...it was pretty tasty, though, and cheap!  Not having horse-knowledge on the tip of my brain, I had to pause a moment at the restrooms, when deciding whether to open the \"colts\" or \"fillies\" door. After dinner, we wandered around a little. They have a large banquet room and a nice outdoor seating area, both on the side of the restaurant, and in front, with a good city view. We found some horses tied up out back, and figured that's where the large party we saw walk in earlier came from. They have a sign for carriage rides, but don't know any details about it. Sounds fun, though!  Overall, I love the location, the food was decent, and I just liked the rustic-ness of the place. Definitely will return again sometime."}
{"text":"This place is my John Wayne, country the good old fashion way perfection. After doing a 3 hour hike in South Mountain, we found ourselves here attempting to gorge ourselves with delightful steaks/ribs/desserts.  I grew up on this place, and I was happy to see that 20 years later, it is just as fantastic as it was when I was a little girl."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is excellent in the Phoenix area. Probably the best one.   The atmosphere is unique, must see it yourself    Amazing views of the city, especially at night time.   Steaks are great.   People are nice.   A little salad bar included with entrees.   Decent pricing."}
{"text":"We typically don't eat out for steak. I make a pretty mean one myself, but had a hankering yesterday. Looked at 100 places here on Yelp and elsewhere and knew that I didn't want a chain and also didn't want to spent over $100 for the two of us, just for steak.  With that said, I found T-Bone here on yelp and it looked like a fun place, not too far away and was shocked that it had been there FOREVER and I had never heard of it. So we went for it.  The place it basically located on 19th avenue where it runs into south mountain. It's a cute western themed place with sawdust on the floor and checkered tablecloths etc.  It's not fancy, but staff was friendly and it felt very \"neighborhood hangoutish\" (yes, I just created a word). We both had the 12 oz rib eye, ordered medium rare, which came with cowboy beans, bread and a \"salad bar.\" We got a bit of a giggle out of it since it consisted of some sort of green been and onion salad, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, carrot slices and a few dressings. I will say that the lettuce was ice cold, very crisp and actually hit the spot. (OK, I was really hungry). We also added a baked potato to share.  The steaks came out in good time and were cooked to order perfectly. They were both good, especially for the price. Not Ruth's Chris, but then again, our whole bill might have paid for a salad there.  The best part was the bread pudding. It was dense, weighed a ton and was topped with ice cream and surrounded by whipped cream. Yum.  I might have given this place 3 stars but the view at sunset combined with the friendly service, value for the price and great dessert bumped this one to a 4. This wound be a great place to bring out of town guests. Take them up to the top of south mountain, then cruise down and over to T-Bones to catch the sunset."}
{"text":"Bad service. Salas bar was pathetic. Bread and beans brought out with the meal? Felt like I was paying 30 dollars to eat like a vagabond in the 1700s.    I really want there to be more food options in the laveen area, but the owner has a lot of work to do before I go back."}
{"text":"We love coming here. good food, reasonable prices, beautiful view of downtown, and super friendly staff. don't expect a lot of frills and fluff - it is all about the meat and a good craft beer."}
{"text":"it was really tasty, but my meat was tough. can't really complain. wish I could give it a 3.5 stars. it really deserves it. great prices too."}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate the closing of our house, and figured we'd give this place a try due to all of the outstanding reviews. Trust me, we weren't looking for anything extravagant or fancy, we just wanted a 'good' steak!  Arriving early, at about 6:00pm, we pulled into the full parking lot. Good sign, right? As we parked the car around the side (since the paved lot was full), we had the fun experience of seeing a group of young drunk men in cowboy hats pissing all over their truck. Well... they do live up to the claim of authentic western atmosphere I guess.  We got in and were offered a seat at the bar since no tables were available, so we made our way over and ordered a few drinks and settled in. The service was good, and we had no complaints as we were expecting a wait on a Saturday night. To our pleasant surprise, we were seated at a table right in front of a window just as we got our drinks! Excellent start!  Too bad from there it went on a steady decline. It took about 10 minutes for someone to notice that we had been sitting there with menus and no service at all before anyone came over. But hey! We were in a good mood, and shit happens. Nothing was going to ruin our celebration dinner of a fantastic steak!  Our order was in, the sun was setting, and conversation was rolling. The music of the performer standing in a back corner was decent and carried across the noise well enough to hear. It was great!  We got up and got a salad from their 'salad bar' - which as another reviewer pointed out - was a very sad little thing. You get some lettuce, croutons, and dressing. That's it. In a very small wooden bowl. No carrots, no tomato, no cucumber, nothing. Just lettuce, croutons and some dressing in a small bowl. Whatever, we're not there for the salad... we're there for the main course! We ate it and resumed looking at the great view.  It was great about 10 minutes later too....  The view was still great 20 minutes later... the waitress came by and asked if we were 'ok'. We were. She didn't offer to refill the drinks yet though.  The lights were glittering about 40 minutes later. Gorgeous. The waitress came by to ask us if we were okay. Yeah, we're still okay. She got us a refill on a drink at that point.  An *hour* later, the view was still beautiful, but we'd been staring at it for an hour, stomachs growling, wondering WTF... The waitress asked us if we were 'Okay' again. We kept our patience in place and nodded our heads, smiled a little less, and said, 'sure', as she explained to us that they were in the process of getting the food out to a very big party in the back and that she was sure that now our food would be coming out soon...  Hour and 15 minutes later.. still no food, but we were offered a bowl of beans and a couple of pieces of 'Texas Toast' - which was just nothing more than steamed bread (not toasted). The beans came in one of the tiny little salad bowls with a spoon, and two side plates. We looked at each other and started laughing. 75 minutes of waiting, AFTER we were seated, and so far we'd had some lettuce, and now we had sad bread with flavorless beans on a plate to show for it. Gee.... thanks....  An hour and 45 minutes have rolled by. At this point, I've lost my sense of humor. I don't give a shit about the view, and no, at this point I'm NOT, 'okay'. We decided right then that if our food was not out in the next 10 minutes we were leaving. But we finally saw our food coming to the table. Finally!!! This steak was about to make everything totally worth it, because even after all of the BS above, THIS was the reason I was here. This steak was going to be amazing!  She sat it down in front of me, the Filet Mignon with a small ice cream scoop size of garlic mashed potatoes that you have to pay extra for (as ANY side dish is $2.50 - $4.00 extra - otherwise you just get the steak). I had ordered my steak medium rare. This is usually what I consider well done as many times I will order my steak rare - but tonight I just wanted a simple medium rare Filet Mignon. This is a steak house, so how hard could this be??  As she plopped it down in front of me, it jiggled, and so I gave it the finger test. (Go ahead and touch the center of the steak with your finger - the firmer it is, the longer it has been cooked). My steak sagged and jiggled, and I thought to myself - surely that can't be good....  She walked away and I cut into that thing and it damn near jumped off the goddamned plate!! The steak was not medium rare, it was not even rare (which I still would have happily eaten), it was seared RAW. An almost TWO HOUR WAIT to be served a raw piece of meat was the last insult I was ready to withstand from this place. I walked it right back over to the checkout counter where our waitress spent most of her time running around, and pointed out the fact that we had been there for going on two hours, and the steak she brought out to us was RAW. We paid for our drinks and we were done.   Never again!"}
{"text":"Horrible! 5 of us ate at this restaurant tonight. Service was very slow! Food was over priced. You sit at pick nick benches. All meals come with a bowl of plain pinto beans (no flavor), for the table to share..... not a bowl a beans per meal. You also get the salad bar which has lettuce, carrots, and cucumber. Most disappointing salad bar I've ever seen! Also you get bread for the table to share. They open a bag of plain, thick, untoasted or flavored bread and place it in a basket. My uncle had the 8 oz filet. He said, \"I never leave a steak behind, but I can't finish this.\"  The steak was horrible! My aunt had the salmon, which was not great. She's never had salmon with a bowl of beans before. My husband and I had the half chicken. It was not a half chicken, more like a quarter size chicken, and had zero flavor. All in all...... horrible service, horrible atmosphere, and horrible over priced food. Will not return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great:  you can drive up or ride your horse to the place and then be treated to wonderful view of Phoenix...try to get a table by the windows.  The menu is not extensive, nor is it too small, it's \"right-sized\".  The only complaint ever heard or read by me was about the salad bar which is very small and limited to just a few items, but do you come to a steakhouse for salad? The steak, chicken and rib items so far are all worth the trip.  Will they knock your socks off, no but they're just plain good.  My wife Debi swears by the grilled salmon and gets it every time we go, which is almost on a weekly basis.  The only menu items we haven't tried are the desserts....yet.  There is even live music on some nights....give it a try!"}
{"text":"Meh. Side dish portions are not consistant. My date & I ordered a side of mash each and not only were these tiny sides expensive at more than $3+ each it seems I got a baby scoop while the other order got a heaping two scoops. The new york strip was a really tough cut of meat but the porterhouse was ok. The salad bar was depressing. Lettuce cucumber croutons and 3 dressings:  a not so good ranch, thousand island, and balsamic. The texas toast was good though it was served with butter that had not been softened so you can imagine how difficult spreading that was."}
{"text":"The meats we ordered were all amazing and worth the price for AZ BBQ. The sides are trash. The salad bar is.... wack."}
{"text":"Great views and great steak. Did not rate it higher due to bad service and everthing but the steak was below par. Corn was cold , beans were blah and and lettuce was wilted."}
{"text":"T-Bone's was pretty spot on with all the other reviews.   I didn't care for it that much, but everyone else I was with said they would def be back again.... I will wash my hair that night.   We went to T-Bone Steakhouse for my lil bro's birthday, it seemed like a fun idea, great view, and you cant go wrong with steaks. I first read the reviews on Yelp before going and had a good feeling. Once we got there it was everything I expected it to be.   Side note to those first timers... when going drive straight down south on 19th ave, you will eventually run into the mountain, right about when you are getting to the end of the road you ill see a tiny sign on the left side of the road prompting you to turn into he parking lot, its easy to miss.   The service was lacking big time, but they were a little busy, the adorable waitress was running her tail off and said she was still fairly new and trying to get the hang of things, truth or not we moved beyond the service.   They do have a nice bar that faces right out to the awesome view of Phoenix, down town is pretty awesome after sunset. I was the only none boring person at the table and ordered T-Bone's own IPA, it was very good, I highly recommend it!  Food time - We were starving! There are about 6 or 7 things on the menu, 4 a la carte sides and a few desserts, and everyone gets to par take in the awesome (not) salad bar. It's comparable to a salad you would quickly throw together at home last minute. Everyone at the table had at least two bowls full so it wasn't bad obviously. We ordered 3 tbones, a top sirloin, a fillet and a 24 oz porterhouse for the birthday boy. My tbone was over cooked and I didn't enjoy it too much, took most home for the dogs. I am not a huge steak person so I should have known better and just ordered the burger or chicken. The fillet was great and perfectly cooked and every bit of the 24 oz porterhouse disappeared so I am assuming it was good too. The sides were pretty standard, bakes potato, mashed potatoes and cowboy beans.  Like I said, everyone in my party liked their food and said they would love to go back, I however would only go back for the view and beer. But those are two pretty awesome things so you do the math. :-)  Oh almost forgot.... the brownie dessert.... amazeballz! Get it!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been here numerous times and it gets better each time.  I always order the chicken and it is awesome.  Friends always order the t-bone and rave about it.  Their beer is also great.  The service is prompt and extremely attentive.  The views are amazing.  Get there before sunset and you can see the gorgeous views."}
{"text":"After going up to Dobbins Lookout and watching the sunset with some of my baseball players from Maryland competing in The Perfect Game Evoshield Upperclassmen National Championship in Goodyear Arizona, we were all in the mood for a good steak. So we looked up steakhouses in Yelp and found the T-Bone Steakhouse and it was very close! So we wheeled down the mountain and through a neighborhood. We weren't sure we were in the right place but then we saw lights and a lot of cars in the parking lot. One of the players said, \"that's always a good sign Coach, to see the place is busy.\" I said \"yes it is! Let's get us some steak!\" We were greeted by friendly smiles and greetings by patrons taking pictures out front as we did the same.  The hostess was quick to get us seated. The manager Riley came over and greeted us and made sure we new she was a softball player in college! She made us feel at home and even offered to show us the kitchen and tell us the history behind the restaurant. Well needless to say, the food was awesome and we had a great experience. Get the Porterhouse!!!"}
{"text":"Nostalgic restaurant with yummy food.  It's always a treat to be here to include an amazing panoramic Phoenix view.  Beef is what's for dinner.  Their best dishes are any of the steak dishes with sides of corn and bake potato.   A very nice place to clilax as I sit here and stare out my window seat after a long day at work with my glass of red wine."}
{"text":"OK. I will concede that the night we visited may have just been a very, very, very, VERY, VERY bad night. I have read multiple reviews (Facebook, etc...) that were extremely positive, and I find it hard to believe that the food and/or service we received could have, in any way, been perceived as positive.  Let's start at the beginning...  We were visiting from the D.C. area and scouted out places prior to taking the trip. After reading all of the reviews, we could not wait to sink our collective teeth into what was sure to be the best steak in all of Arizona. We walked in, and stood in the doorway (no room to wait) for about 15 minutes. I felt bad, as there was a family trying to eat right next to us, and as uncomfortable as we were, it had to have been much worse for them. We were finally seated, our drink order was taken, and when we finally received them, my (Coke/Pepsi) tasted like it had been sitting in melting ice for a while, as it was extremely watered down.  Not discouraged, we placed our order and headed off to the salad....bar...? Not sure I would call it that. There was lettuce, some sort of (pickled?) green beans, onions, croutons, carrots, and three kinds of dressing. That's it. Limited, but hey, we were here for the steak!  I got the bone-in ribeye, my daughters each got the filet, my son and his girlfriend split the much talked about 40oz porterhouse. Mine tasted like it was first boiled and stripped of all flavor and was severely underdone and under-seasoned. My daughters both ordered medium-well and I swear I heard the distinct sound of mooing coming from them. My son also ordered medium-well, and it was not just under cooked, but raw in the middle, and ice cold to the touch. He politely asked the waitress if she could have them re-fire \"when she had a moment\" and she proceeded to explain that it wasn't her fault, and pointed the finger squarely at the cook (gotta love teamwork). Once it came back, it was still WAY undercooked, but at least it was cooked this time. My wife, perhaps sensing danger, ordered chicken, which was quite good. Sides were just awful. Won't even go into that any further.  Seeking an opportunity to salvage our meal, I noticed they had apple pie, and was game to try. Our waitress never even asked about dessert, and dropped the check on us, so sorry, I can't comment on that.  Would be VERY hesitant to return, but I am still curious as to why they receive so many favorable comments. I must be a glutton for punishment, but to satisfy my own curiosity, will give them one more shot next time I am in the neighborhood.  Oh. View was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for over 6 years and love it.  This is a true cowboy style restaurant with an all you can eat basic salad bar, cowboy beans & toast, potatoes, and all the common meat options.  The food is usually good.  The atmosphere is the best part, low key and awesome views.  If you live in Laveen or South Phoenix you should frequent the place.  They have locally crafted delicious brews.  We love to ride horses or motorcycles here, watch the sunset and chat it up with the locals and the workers.  Favorite restaurant in Laveen!  Hitching posts out back if you want to ride your horse here.  Very close (walking distance) to South Mountain trail head too."}
{"text":"One of the old bastions of Phoenix that doesn't have that fake Sam Fox feeling on it. No glitzy, trendy crap anywhere to be seen.  This place is about two things:  1. Steaks 2. Views  I'm so bummed they paved the parking lot, too. Detracted from that feeling of getting out of the city.  The salad bar ... so 1995 retro.   Tip: get here before sunset and try to snag a window seat. The view out west is stunning. Also a great place to watch monsoons.  It's also nice to finish your drinks and/or desert on the patio."}
{"text":"Always good and nice that it's been updated some! Steaks are always cooked perfectly and the staff is wonderful!  Salad bar is tasty! Glad we stopped by.  The view is fantastic love this place!"}
{"text":"We went back to T-Bone last night with a friend from out of town. We had vodka sodas, which were well-mixed and cheap. My husband and I tried the \"combo\" (only $15) this time, which featured 1/4 of a chicken and a fillet - the chicken was just as moist and delicious as last time, and the fillet was so tender and cooked to just the right level of doneness I requested (as was my husband and my friend's meat). The sides were just as unremarkable as last time, but the meat was even more flavorful than I remember. That flavor, combined with the delicious apple pie a la mode and the incredible view, which was amazing to share with our guest, makes me bump T-Bone up a star."}
{"text":"The view of downtown Phoenix from South Mountain is nice.   The salad bar is depressing, seriously, the salad bar at my kids' public grade school blows this away.   The sides that come with the dinners are underwhelming but the cowboy beans aren't bad. Please take the foil off the baked potato, this isn't IHOP.  Desserts are pretty good. I like the brownie and the bread pudding.   The steaks are slightly above average.....when cooked right.   Service is ho-hum.  Summary: Okay steak with sides and salad bar that you would honestly expect in a hospital. Actually, I've had hospital salad bars that blow this away. Plagued by inconsistencies in steak temps and service. If you go during the right time of year, and catch them on a good shift, you can eat a decent steak and watch a nice sunset; or you can wait 45 minutes for cold beans and burnt steak."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Humongous rib rack, couldnt eat it all.  Delicious dry rub steak cooked perfectly medium like we like it.  The cowboy beans are mildly spicey, not typical sweet beans i was expecting. The one drawback - Only vegetable in the house is on the salad bar.  Good wait service.  Got incredibly busy on the thur eve we came in.  Very popular local spot.  Worth the drive :)"}
{"text":"Steak was cooked perfectly and the bread was amazing. Super friendly service and incredible view of the city at night!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Location - is beautiful, just on the edge of South Mountain, a rustic location that overlooks the city appears to have the potential of something really special.... a local treasure. Unfortunately, I instead of discovering a diamond in the rough, it was just rough. Walking in, the place was empty. First, I ordered a water (and if I drank, I'd probably be upset with the 4 beers on tap they have as a selection) which came in a Denny's like plastic cup. Next, I ordered a T-Bone steak for $22 (the place is called T-Bone, so you can't go wrong, right?) that comes with \"cowboy beans\" and an a-la carte baked potato. I was offered the complimentary salad bar which should be called the elementary side salad. Greens, 3 dressing options, tomatoes and croutons. Thanks! I'm 98% sure I heard a Foreman Grill going off in the kitchen. Probably for my steak, because the cut of meat was pathetic and the steak was cooked inconsistently (Medium ask). The potato came wrapped in foil and the individually wrapped butter to go along with it was served with two slices of bread. I kept looking around thinking there had to be camera's or something documenting a reality TV show on bad restaurants and Gordon Ramsay or someone would come out the kitchen and ask me how awful everything was. Then they had the nerve to suggest a 18% tip on the bill. LOL... You can only laugh when places are this bad (the servers standing around drinking from the fountain soda machine & eating crackers from the \"salad bar\", yea, those pre-packaged saltines) and I would give them 1/2 a star if I could. The only place you'll find a worse steak is in the electronics section of a Barnes & Noble. Stay away, trust me."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite steakhouse in the valley...but I've never had the steak.  I used to visit once a week and order the grilled salmon. One evening the owner talked me into trying the fried trout, to which I reluctantly agreed after voicing my objections to trout. He assured me it was boneless, didn't taste fishy, and said he would bring me the salmon if I didn't like it. He didn't have to; I found a new favorite! The trout is amazing and the only trout I've ever enjoyed. I have no idea how that magician/chef accomplished that feat, but it truly is boneless and not fishy. It pairs perfectly with their garlic mashed potatoes. The view from T-bone is stunning. I love the rustic ambiance and am usually one of the first customers there in the evening. The owner and waitresses are friendly and fun, and this is the perfect place to hide out from life for awhile with beer and a good book.  Or with friends.  But definitely beer. The musician's sets on the weekend aren't cheery enough for my mood and there's no dance floor--yet--so that's the only reason this review is four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"My husband calls me at work on Friday to say we are going out to dinner. I figured it would either be pizza, a sonaran hot dog or a torta (choices are pretty limited out by us for a sit down meal). Once I was home our friend calls us and says let's go get a steak down on 19th Avenue. I ask my husband where is there a steakhouse on 19th Avenue? We get the details and he says south of Dobbins Road. Now I have driven this road hundreds of times, I have never seen a steakhouse, let alone a sign for a steakhouse. (That is my only complaint, get a sign at Dobbins or Baseline Roads pointing towards your steakhouse, had our friend not invited us, we still would not know you existed.).   Yes, a rustic, western steakhouse is south of Dobbins Road, on 19th Avenue. It was bigger than I expected. My husband and our friend got the t-bones, his sister got the fillet mignion and I got the chicken/fillet combo. I thought the food was great! So did our entire table. The cowboy beans come family style (big dish that you spoon yourself) along with texas-syle bread with soft butter. The smoked chicken was amazing, and my fillet was tender. My husband said he will be ordering that next time, he thought the chicken was wonderful and it is a great size portion.  Everyone else got salads ( I am not a salad eater), basic salad fixins (lettuce, tomoato, onion, cucumber, crotons and dressing). They have a little salad bar set-up that your fix up your own salad.   I did however get desert, apple pie with cinnamon sqirl ice cream! Yum-O!   The view is beautiful, so peaceful to stare at the bright city lights below. I will definitley be taking any out of town guests and even suggest to my husband I would like to come back for my birthday in a couple of weeks.   Again my only complaint is just not knowing sooner that it was there.  But having been there for over 40 years, I can see the \"word of mouth\" compaign has suited them well! I also see they have Facebook with 16 followers, so get going and go friend them!"}
{"text":"Ok so maybe I should offer more stars but I won't. One star is for the service and the other is for the stunning view. This restaurant has an old feel/charm to it. We did family dinner here and everyone ordered something different. New York steaks, prime rib, cheeseburgers, and ribeye, even chicken. All of us agreed that our food was very bland. Little to no salt or seasoning of any kind. If that's the way it was intended to be, then my apologies. I requested a medium well steak and it came out more medium. I didn't complain though. I have a fear when you send food back to the kitchen. The cowboy beans were pinto beans. We were under the impression they were more like baked beans. The salad bar offered lettuce cucumber, tomatoes, and a cold green bean salad. Maybe my expectations were a little high, but I won't be returning nor recommending someone else try it."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend took me here for my birthday.  Awesome steak!  Very basic dinner: steak, beans, and salad.  But the steak was probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mediocre is the only thing I could sat about this place. The food was bland. It was as if the cooks had no idea what salt and pepper are. The salad bar, if you could call it that, was lettuce and 6 dressings. Is it really out of their costs to add a coupe other things to make it more interesting? Croutons and possibly cheese would be nice. Our server was less than attentive. We didn't get all of our food and refills were merely non exsistant. Also their menu is very limited. If you just want steak and potatoes, and aren't a fan of flavor then this is the place for you. If you want a good tasting steak, options at a salad bar and more than 1 vegetable on the menu go somewhere else.  I'm truly not sure how they are in business."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a family favorite. I've been going there for many years. The steak is always delish, the staff is always courteous, and you can't beat the view of the city. It isn't cheap eats but it is worth it for the quality of the steak that you get.  The menu is very basic, but it is that way intentionally...it is a steakhouse.  Weekends can get extremely busy and the restaurant isn't huge so we usually go during the week or earlier in the evening. The salad bar offers very little choices, but again, it is a steakhouse. If you're craving steak this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE. Out of the \"nightly special\", which was, ribs. Strike one. Waitress for some weird reason thought we ordered already when we hadn't. Just getting water to the table was an issue. Strike 2. While waiting for our dinner, we decided to visit the salad bar and there was an empty ranch container. So we waited for that to be refilled. Then we waited 35 min to get our dinner & the chicken was cold. Strike 3. If I were the owner I'd fire my entire staff and that goofy GM and start fresh. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food took too long to be served, the staff was not friendly at all.  Beans were horrible and the steak could have been better, I was told about this place by a friend of mine, apparently he thought this place would offer our party a good time. Unfortunately this was not the case"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for 15 years and the new owner has kept the tradition going.  I read a lot of negative reviews, but they all wanted some high tech restaurant.  T-Bones is a good ole western places that doesn't need the bells and whistles.  After a long day in the sun if you want a simple salad with your steak, T-Bones is the place to be.  A no frill good ole down to earth restaurant.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken was amazing. I was expecting the usual BBQ dry chicken. But after a long drive on 19th Ave I would say the food was totally worth the trip. Staff was nice as well and they have a sweet TV in the back."}
{"text":"I loves this place, go near sunset time and you will not be disapointed, it has that typical texas bbq resturaunt feel, but with their main advantage is the location, other reviwers are right, there is room for a bigger salad bar, their beans were awsome, but the corn of the cob tasted medicore, def not fresh, the meat was delicious, but the fiance ended up for one side having a lot of fat"}
