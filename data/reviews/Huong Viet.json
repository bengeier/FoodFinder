{"text":"The best quality pho place I have been to!  The food is great, the service is awesome and friendly.  I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great prices, Great Portions, Delicious food, a menu with variety and offers some traditional dishes you will have a hard time finding elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Food: comparing the pho this place serves to other places I wouldn't say it's a go. The broth is bland and needs more flavour.

Customer service: when we told the owner or server  the taste is bland he took it so personal and said that no one other than us complained about the broth, we really didn't complain, all we did was ask for a powder/salt/msg or anything than can add some flavour. Then the chef was called and she made it clear that since this morning no one complained but us. What shocked me that no effort was taken to improve our customer experience. It was more of a deal with it situation. 

NOTE: they have a sign that says: please let us know if you don't enjoy your experience. We did let them know but I don't see the point. See picture attached. 

Price: 2 pho bowls (1 small 1 medium) and 3 veggie spring rolls - $20

Do I recommend the place: No"}
{"text":"New owners since December! 

Husband and wife let us dine even though it was 10pm (their closing time) 

The food came in generous portions and the veggies topping were fresh. 

Bun Cha Ca and fresh avodca shake was delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my gym.  I came here twice after 11 AM, but the door was close and there was no one inside.  Before I came, I called a few times, but no one answer the phone.

Then I went to another restaurant to get food.  Then, the owner of this restaurant called me about 45 minutes later explained to me that she was late and I thought that she has some kind of emergency to handle, so I gave this restaurant the second chance by coming back about 3 weeks later.  Guess what?  Same thing happened again.  Except this time, there was another the customer wondering around trying to see why this restaurant is not open yet.  I went to a restaurant across the street to get food.

It seems the restaurant manager doesn't care nor respect the customers.  The opening hour was from 11 AM, then why no one there after 11:30 AM?  Not once, but twice and there was no sign in the front door indicating that they will be late or closed whatsoever!

I will NEVER come back to this place. This is my very first one star review on yelp and this restaurant deserves it!"}
{"text":"It was kind of a mission to get here but I think I wouldn't mind doing it again for their bun bo hue. One of the best I've ever had. Parking is a pain though cause it's street parking (unless they have back parking that I don't know about). Went on a Monday afternoon and we were the only ones there for a while. Our server was super friendly. I think he's also the owner. Quick service. Food got here in no time. Got the bun bo hue and it's one the best I've ever had. Friend got the Vietnamese crab noodle and flavour was good. Their regular pho is also pretty good. Price is on the cheaper end and you get 15% off pho when you check in on yelp."}
{"text":"I used to go with previous owners. Now it is cleaner, and accept debit. While the prices are slightly higher still great value! Super friendly service, and my rare beef pho, still delicious. I hope they survive."}
